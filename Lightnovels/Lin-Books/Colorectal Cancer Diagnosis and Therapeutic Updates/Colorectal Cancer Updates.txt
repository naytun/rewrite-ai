Abstract: Histopathology involves the study of tissue samples using a microscope to
understand the normal and abnormal contents of a given sample. Normal histology of
colorectal areas, such as mucosa and muscular, is greatly altered during the
development of cancer. Colorectal cancer can be divided into various grades during the
histopathological examination of tissues, which shows the extent of invasion of tumour
into the colon. This examination can also be used to understand the type of carcinoma
in the colon. Many factors affect this histopathological study and many drawbacks can
occur in grading systems that need to be improved.

Keywords: Alterations, Grading, Histopathology, Normal histology, Variant.
INTRODUCTION

Histopathology involves scanning of tissue samples under the microscope to
investigate and understand the presentation of disease at a cellular level. It allows
us to understand any cellular abnormality which occurs in the disease. This
feature can be used to identify the grade of cancer, showing the extent of
growth/spread of cancer. The variant of cancer has its characteristic appearance in
a microscopic examination which can be easily identified and treated accordingly.
Grading can be done by various methods, however, they have their drawbacks.

NORMAL HISTOLOGY OF COLORECTAL AREA

The colon has a mucosa made of columnar epithelium. It shows the presence of a
brush border. Many goblet cells secreting mucus are present in this layer. Lamina
propia is rich in leukocytes and lymphoid modules buried into the lower layer.
Muscularis mucosae are prominent and can be divided into an inner circular layer
and outer layer arranged lengthwise. The submucosa is a mixture of irregular con-

nective and adipose tissue. It contains many blood vessels and neurons.
Muscularis externa is made up of thick bands of muscles running along the length
of the colon [1].

The rectal region shows histology more or less similar to the colon. Classic
features, such as teniae coli and haustra, are absent in the rectal region. The
muscular layer is well-developed, which helps in contraction during defecation

[2].
GENERAL PRESENTATION IN COLORECTAL CANCER

In the first stage (stage 0) of colorectal cancer, dysplasia of epithelium of the
colorectal area causes abnormal growth, leading to the formation of a mass of
cells or polyps. Due to genetic abnormalities, the cells in polyps now divide
uncontrollably to form neoplasia. These neoplastic tumors are localized to the
epithelium or endothelium. They do not exhibit potential for metastasis.

The extensive dysplasia in the localized tumour is associated with some rather
distinguishable changes in cell structure and architecture. Changes in architecture
can be as remarkable as seeing glandular epithelial cells in the muscularis of the
colon. Cells and nuclei can be seen in more than one distinct shape. The amount
of chromosomal material in the nucleus is more than normal. The polarity of a
nucleus is disturbed due to cytoskeletal disturbances. The nuclei may exhibit
crowding. Cells, due to genetic abnormalities, lose their glandular structure. The
nuclear matter is in excess and can be seen arranged irregularly.

High-grade dysplasia in polyps is also accompanied by many changes in the
cellular structure. The cells in the polyp may lose their glandular nature; the
mucin production may stop permanently; the nuclear matter is in a higher amount
as compared to cytoplasm; the appearance of nuclei also changes; and The cells
may appear irregularly arranged in cribriform shape.

In the second stage (stage 1), cancer spreads to the layer below the mucous
membrane, i.e., to the submucosa. This certifies the polyp being cancerous. This
tumour now has the ability to enter deeper into the layers of the intestine and
invade the vasculature of the body [3].

In further stages, the polyp invades deeper into layers of the colon, finally
crossing muscularis mucosae to enter the lymph nodes through which it can travel
to other organs.

NEED FOR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL INSPECTION IN COLORECTAL
CARCINOMA

1.

Histological variants- there are many variations that can be seen in
manifestations of colorectal carcinoma, such as mucinous adenocarcinoma,
signet ring adenocarcinoma. These have different histologic features which can
be diagnosed through histopathological studies. These help to identify variants,
such as medullary carcinoma involving sheets of cells with a round nucleus
with growth along the circumference of the tumour [4].

. Cancer staging- earlier staging of colorectal carcinoma is based on gland

formation in the tumour. But this analysis is not accurate due to high variability
in individuals regarding gland formation. And the behavior of tumours, whether
differentiated or not, is not very much different. Hence, a new criterion for
dividing tumours into stages based on poorly differentiated clusters (PDC) is
employed where the number of PDC is used to differentiate cancer into stages
where the greater number of PDC means more advanced stage [5].

. Prognosis- histopathological analysis can help to predict any future

manifestations of colorectal carcinoma. Histopathologic analysis can reveal
many parameters of the tumors, such as the variant, tumour stage, and invasion
depth [4].

FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF
COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

1.

Tumour grading- tumour grading is an important method for the prediction of
prognosis and identification of tumours. But there is more than one way of
grading the tumours, and they are not similar at all.

. Nuclear grading- it involves analysis of size and shape of nucleus of dividing

cells and implies that lower grade cancers do have very few numbers of such
cells.

. Tumour budding- it involves the formation of undifferentiated cells near the

invasive edge of the tumor. The extent of budding affects the probability of
recurrence even after the treatment. These “buds’ are very small in size and do
not have any special function, such as secretion of mucin. Hence,
distinguishing these buds from colorectal carcinoma is pretty difficult.

. Tumour border architecture- it can be either smooth or rough. It does not

indicate any staging of the tumour, but itself is an indication of worsening the
condition of malignancy. Budding is observed more frequently in tumours with
an irregular border [6].

HISTOPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF COLORECTAL CANCER

Colorectal carcinoma can be of different types, such as adenocarcinoma,
neuroendocrine carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma,
spindle cell carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma. In all these types, the
most prominent are adenocarcinomas [7]. These originate from the mucosa of the
colon and rectum. Conventional adenocarcinomas mostly show the formation of
gland-like structure, which forms the basis of grading those cancers. Well,
differentiated adenocarcinomas show almost complete gland formation. Around
50-90% gland formation is seen in moderately differentiated carcinomas. And
those which are least differentiated carcinomas show at most 50% gland
formation. Most of the diagnosed adenocarcinomas are moderately differentiated.
Around 20% are poorly differentiated, and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas
are least diagnosed.

Grading of tumours is a subjective analysis. An older method involves two grades
of tumours; low-grade tumours include well and moderately differentiated
tumours, whereas low-grade tumours include poorly differentiated tumours. This
grading system is better as it reduces variations in diagnosis due to the observer.
This method also adds significance to the prognosis of the disease [8, 9]. This
grading of tumours is independent of the stage of cancer progression, and a high
grade usually means high chances of morbidity. This system only works with
adenocarcinomas [10, 11].

The cancers are diagnosed using surgical procedures, such as polypectomy and
endoscopic biopsy. The aim behind microscopic examinations is only to look for
the signs of invasion into the surrounding tissues. But these results may be faulty
if the sample is not taken from proper depth or from the proper region. In any
biopsy, identification of mucosae muscularis is very important as it indicates the
progress of invasion easily. Any invasive malignancy invades through muscularis
mucosae to reach the submucosa and then to blood vessels [12]. The invasion can
also be characterized by desmoplasia, which is a fibrous proliferation surrounding
the invading tumour cells. Invasive cancers show necrotic patches in glandular
lumina, also called “dirty necrosis’. This is useful to predict the primary stages for
invasion of any unknown malignancy. In colorectal carcinoma, cancer should at
least reach submucosa for a minimum invasion. The reason may be a very limited
network of lymphatics restricting further reach, limiting spread to upper layers,
such as lamina propia. This superficial spread is called high-grade dysplasia. But
the treatment decision should be taken based on complete evaluation [13].
20 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.
HISTOLOGIC VARIANTS

The highest number of diagnosed colorectal carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Of
those, mucinous and signet ring carcinomas constitute one-tenth of the cases.
From those, the incidence of signet ring carcinoma is around 1%. Mucinous
cancers are characterized by extracellular mucin covering more than half of the
tumour volume. Signet ring cancers have the nucleus pushed to a side due to the
excess quantity of mucin inside cells. Mucinous histology is generally associated
with advanced stages of carcinoma, but it depends on tumour staging [5].
Mucinous histology is generally not connected to any future conditions caused by
cancer. Meanwhile, signet ring histology is said to have very less effect on the
fate of disease and is found in cases of advanced-stage exhibiting invasion in a
lymph node, liver metastasis. This aggressive behavior is reported due to a
different molecular pathway that takes place during progression. Mucinous
carcinomas exhibit microsatellite instability, which is an altered number of
repeated DNA bases different than the original structure. And they also exhibit
nonpolyposis and methylation [14]. Many signet ring tumours also exhibit
microsatellite instability but that is not a confirmed indicator of patient survival
[15]. Medullary carcinoma and serrated adenocarcinoma are two types of
colorectal cancers associated with separate pathways. Medullary carcinomas are
generally large progressions, present in the proximal colon and largely seen in
females. They tend to expand and have a well-defined growth. They are made of
sheet-like structures of cells having round nuclei having noticeable nucleoli and
exhibit morphology similar to Crohn’s disease. These carcinomas show a high
degree of microsatellite instability. These do not usually invade lymphatics
aggressively [16]. Serrated adenocarcinomas have not been discovered too long
ago. They are distinctly shaped malignancies. These carcinomas originate from
serrated adenomas or hyperplasic crypt foci or mixed polyps. These carcinomas
show a typical phenotype due to high methylation in the promoter region of DNA.
The majority of serrated adenocarcinomas have low microsatellite instability and
originate from serrated adenoma. And only a few have high microsatellite
instability and originate from mixed polyps or sessile serrated adenoma. The
morphology shows saw-like epithelium, cosin-rich cytoplasm of cells. The nuclei
seem to be more like vesicles with prominent nucleoli. This pathway of serrated
adenocarcinoma is important as it may get mixed easily in routine checkups and is
difficult to distinguish [4].

GRADING OF COLORECTAL CARCINOMA USING
HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

Poor analysis of the progression of tumours using histology is a major issue in
predicting the future direction of the disease. Hence, examination of tissue
Histopathology Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 21

samples is usually included in the complete examination of colorectal carcinoma.
Earlier, colorectal carcinoma was classified into grades based on the percentage of
gland formation in three categories where category G1 stands for a well-formed
gland, G2 involves a moderate gland formation, and G3 involves a poorly formed
gland. This grading system was not accurate as the grading varied based on the
observer. The appearance and behavior of well and moderately differentiated
carcinomas are similar, which makes the diagnosis even harder. Another system
by WHO involves two grades where low grade includes both G1, G2 and high
grade involves G3 type of tumours. Still many drawbacks exist in the system,
such as the least differentiated component should be used as the basis to separate
the categories. This type of classification only works on adenocarcinomas and not
on other variants. A common drawback is a dependence on microsatellite
instabilities which may not be a perfect indicator of the grade of cancer. To set a
standard grading for cancer, a better system has been put in place. The system is
placed on counting clusters that have 5 or more cells and which are not organized
in a glandular structure. These are called “Poorly Differentiated Clusters’. These
may be present in the invasive part of the tumour or within the tumour. As these
clusters are larger, they can be easily differentiated from tumour budding and can
be easily identified. There are clear gaps seen around poorly differentiated
clusters. These gaps are caused due to reversed polarity of cancer cells [17].

Issues with PDC System and their Rectification

1. Transverse sections of crypts or tumors in glands may look like PDCs during
an examination. But many cytological features, such as clear space around
PDCs, are absent in the crypts and neoplastic glands, which helps us
differentiate.

2. Inflammation in the tumour may cause the breaking of tumours into segments
that may look like PDCs in a microscope. Hence, such inflamed areas should
be avoided during gross examination for PDCs [5].

CONCLUSION

Histopathologic examination reveals many details regarding colorectal cancer,
such as the grading and variant of cancer. There are many systems of grading
which are based upon many factors related to tumours. Although this examination
is important for the identification and prognosis of colorectal carcinoma, many
discrepancies in the grading systems reduce the reliability of the grading systems.

Abstract: Chemotherapy is one of the established first-line options for the treatment of
colorectal cancer. Chemotherapy contains various molecules acting against multiple
factors, contributing to the growth of cancer cells. Chemotherapeutic regimens can vary
based on the stages of cancer and the components as well as the strength of
medications. The recent addition of agents such as antibodies against various molecular
targets involved, such as receptors and components of signaling pathways, resulted in
even more precise therapy.

Keywords: Chemotherapy, Components, Novel agents, Stages of cancer,
Targeted therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Chemotherapy is the use of chemical moieties to treat cancer. Chemotherapy can
be given systemically as well as locally. Chemotherapy regimens change based
upon the cancer stage and include components having varied mechanisms of
action. Their combinations show a synergistic effect in killing the cancer cells.

CHEMOTHERAPY AND COLORECTAL CANCER

Chemotherapy involves the treatment of colorectal cancer using medications that
are taken orally or through an I. V. The drugs travel throughout the body and reach
the desired tumour site, where they show their effect and kill the cancer cells [1].

Administration of Chemotherapeutic Agents

Systemic chemotherapy involves the entry of drugs and delivery through the
bloodstream to reach the position of cancer inthe colon or rectum. The drugs

involved in systemic chemotherapy are fluorouracil, capecitabine, irinotecan,
oxaliplatin, trifluridine, and tripiracil (American Cancer Society) [1].

Regional chemotherapy: This type of therapy is carried out for metastatic cancers
which may have spread to the liver. The hepatic artery, the most anticipated route
of metastasis, is targeted. The artery is blocked to cut blood supply to the liver.
Then drugs are injected, which enter the liver and show their effect limited to the
liver only [2].

CHEMOTHERAPY IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF COLORECTAL
CANCER

Chemotherapy is administered based on the stage of cancer, which describe its
severity and progress. It is divided into stages 0 to 4 depending on the severity
and progress. Stage 0 cancer is limited to layers of the colon and rectum. Surgery
to remove the cancer is the most frequently sought option to get rid of cancer.
Surgery includes the removal of a locally formed polyp or tumor. But in the case
of large tumours, the area of the colon should be removed. Stage 1 cancer invades
deeply in the colon but not outside of it. If the cancer is a part of polyp, it can be
removed, and no cells are present at the edge. If the polyp is high grade, deeper
surgical intervention is required. For cancer not in a polyp, the colon section must
be severed [3].

Stage 2 cancers can be classified according to the level of invasion into their
surroundings. 2A stage involves cancer reaching to tissues around the colon. 2B
cancers reach as deep as the peritoneum and 2C cancers cross the peritoneum and
reach even other organs. For this type of cancer, surgery for the removal of a
specific part of the colon is the main method and adjuvant chemotherapy is also
used to shrink the tumors. National comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) gives
guidelines that vary upon high-risk factors, poorly differentiated clusters, invasion
in lymph and other organs. For the 2A stage, treatment with 5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, or capecitabine is suggested. For those who exhibit high-risk factors
in stage 2A or have progressed to stages 2B and 2C, treatment includes a
combination of 5-fluorouracil & leucovorin, capecitabine, or a combination of 5-
fluorouracil, leucovorin, capecitabine or therapy, including 5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, oxaliplatin, or a combination of oxaliplatin & capecitabine. In this
treatment, the risk and benefit should always be considered [4].

Stage 3 cancers completely cross various layers of the colon and may invade
nearby tissues by reaching nearby lymph nodes. Surgery is still the first option,
and adjuvant chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumour. The chemotherapeutic
regimen should start after a duration of 8 weeks from surgery and should last 5-6
months after surgery. The first-ever combination given was 5-fluorouracil and L-
26 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Gore et al.

folinic acid daily for 5 days in a month. After the addition of capecitabine in this
regimen, the new combination showed a better effect and tolerance than the
earlier combination. The addition of oxiplatin to 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and
capecitabine enhanced the overall as well as the disease-free survival rate above
70% as compared to only fluoropyrimidine. Combinations such as FOLFIRI
(folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan), IFL(irinotecan & fluorouracil), and
FOLFOX (Fluorouracil, oxaliplatin & folinic acid) are used in metastatic cancers,
but these combined with VGEF/EGFR targeted therapies did not show any
significant effect. The validated regimen for stage 3 includes combinations such
as FOLFOX and CAPOX as a doublet regimen and combinations such as
LV5FU2 (leucovorin & 5-fluorouracil) and capecitabine without oxaliplatin.
CAPOX is superior to FOLFOX, where the number of injections is less.
Dipyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered before any
treatment to avoid the toxicity of capecitabine (Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage
III Colon Cancer, Julien Taieb 1,2,* and Claire Gallois 1,2).

Stage 4 cancers involve the spread of cancer to distant tissues. Chemotherapy is
the major treatment option to control the spread of cancer. Surgery is not always
preferred but can be considered for patients showing metastasis. 5-fluorouracil
was the most preferred single-molecule for the treatment of progression of
colorectal carcinoma. The addition of leucovorin as a biomodulator enhances the
response and this combination is the best choice for patients intolerant for
chemotherapy. Mayo and Rosewell park regimens of this combination are widely
used. This combination shows better response and progress-free survival.
Capecitabine, a fluorouracil prodrug can also be used along with leucovorin
which reduces the toxicity even further.

Irinotecan is used solely when the above combination fails and has been shown to
prolong survival by 2-3 months. In combination with 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin, it showed an even greater survival benefit. Irinotecan given along with
iv. bolus fluorouracil improved the survival time to 17-20 months. When
combined with capecitabine, it showed increased toxicity; hence, it is not applied
anymore. Oxiplatin, when used alone, has shown limited efficacy. When it is
coupled with fluorouracil, leucovorin as a FOLFOX combination shows a much
greater benefit. Along with capecitabine as a CAPOX combination, it can be used
as first as well second-line therapy [5].

COMPONENTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)

5-FU is commonly used in patients with advanced-stage colorectal carcinoma. It
is a member of the fluoropyrimidine class. This molecule incorporate itself into
Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 27

RNA. It also prevents the action of the thymidylate synthase enzyme, which in
turn prevents DNA synthesis. It is usually given with leucovorin, reduced folate
that stabilizes the binding between the drug and DNA. This may be given I.V. or
orally as prodrug capecitabine. It may cause diarrhoea, stomatitis, and
neutropenia.

Irinotecan

This drug inhibits the topoisomerase-1 enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for
the opening of DNA strands before transcription. This opening lasts for a short
period of time and is repaired easily. But irinotecan stabilizes this opening of the
double helix and causes the breakdown of DNA. It leads to cell death. It can be
used as a second-line agent, or it can be used alongside 5-FU in the first-line
treatment as well. It may cause side effects such as alopecia, diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting.

Oxaliplatin

This molecule is a platinum derivative. It shows synergism with 5-FU while
treating colorectal cancer. This molecule enters DNA and forms large complexes
with DNA molecules that prevent cell division and cause cell death. This
molecule also reduces the action of thymidylate synthase and hence prevents
DNA formation. Side effects such as neuropathy may be observed [5].

NOVEL THERAPIES FOR COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

Agarose Microbeads

Tumors also alter their growth based on positive or negative feedback. The
positive feedback is seen in the form of compensatory hyperplasia. A similar
observation is seen when, given proper signals, growth stops even in absence of
cancer cells. This novel medication is based on the very principle and contains
two concentric layers of agarose-containing cells of colorectal carcinoma
sandwiched between them. Mouse renal cortical adenocarcinoma cells have been
used in experimental settings. The one-cell colony grows to hundreds of cells. The
growth stops when they reach a specific size. The agarose beads, which restrict
the growth, cause formation of tumour inhibitory molecules. They act in both in-
vitro and in-vivo settings. Proteins such as gelsoin and fibulin are part of the array
of growth-reducing proteins. These molecules prolong the cycle time, act in S-
phase and reduce cell growth. As the mechanism of action is not specific to any
particular type, it can be used against all types.
28 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Gore et al.
Anti-inflammatory Agents

Chronic inflammation is a common finding in colorectal cancer caused by
immune cells. They generate reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen through the
action of enzymes cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. This inflammation helps in
tumour metastasis and resistance mechanisms. To counter this inflammation, anti-
inflammatory agents are used. They block cyclooxygenases and prevent the
synthesis of arachidonic acid derivatives, causing inflammation. The use of
molecules such as aspirin has proven to be a good choice in treating colorectal
carcinomas. But these molecules cause side effects such as ulcers, kidney stones.
Hence, their use is limited to only extreme cases. Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors
such as celecoxib gave excellent results but showed cardiovascular toxicity. These
drugs are now formulated as microbeads and other formulations that are targeted
at colon cells, which reduces the side effects.

Probiotics

Microbial flora in the intestine plays an important role in the progression of colon
cancer. Hence, it may be possible that changing the bacterial exposure may alter
the effect on colorectal cancers. Hence, the administration of probiotics may have
a beneficial effect. Probiotics include bacterial species such as lactobacillus
species, lactococcus, enterococcus, streptococcus. These bacteria may restore the
normal microflora of the digestive tract and reduce any anomalies. In mice, oral
administration of lactobacillus showed induction of apoptosis due to soluble
polysaccharides from these bacteria. Along with these effects’ bacteria may show
antioxidant activity through the generation of antioxidant peptides, which
scavenge free radicals.

Functional Foods

Reactive oxygen species play main role in colorectal cancer. These are molecules
where oxygen has one electron extra or one less electron. In low concentrations, it
play an integral part in the defence mechanism of the body. But when factors such
as pollution tobacco cause excess production of these radicals, they damage
various cell structures, oxidize DNA and lipids, and have been associated with
diseases such as arthritis and cancer. In these cases, maintaining the redox balance
of the body is important; hence is the prime target of functional foods. Many such
foods contain polyphenols, which are secondary metabolites. Many foods, such as
cereals, nuts, corn, oats, beans, pulses, wheat, fruits, vegetables, and even
beverages such as tea and coffee have them. These polyphenols have one ring and
one or many hydroxyl groups in their structures. These compounds contain many
Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 29

classes such as phenolic acids, polyphenols, anthocyanins, etc. It have strong
antioxidant action in addition to anticancer action. They induce apoptosis and
detoxify enzymes. These compounds even modify intracellular signaling and
regulate the host’s immune system [6].

TARGETED THERAPIES

Targeted therapies are directed towards a specific type of cell and do not exert
their effects on other cells. For cancer, targeted therapies may work on many
levels, such as inhibiting proliferation, migration, and differentiating. The main
agent responsible for targeting is a monoclonal antibody. These target specific
extracellular or intracellular components and induce cell death by many
mechanisms [7].

Targeting EGFR

EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is a part of Erb8 (erythroblastosis
oncogene B) and HER (human epidermal growth factor) receptors. There are
altogether 8 varients. These belong to the class of tyrosine kinase receptors. The
molecule for activation is EGF/TGF-a. Upon activation, many signaling pathways
such as JAK/STAT3, RAS, RAF, MEK are activated, which leads to cell
proliferation. These are overexpressed in cancers such as glioma, melanoma,
medulloblastoma, and tumours such as oesophageal and colorectal cancers [8].

Cetuximab and Panitumumab

Cetuximab was the first antibody discovered against EGFR in 1995. It is a
chimeric immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule. When it binds to EGFR, it causes
internalization of the complex and then degrades it. It increases survival time
without disease progression. Combining cetuximab with currently ongoing
chemotherapy gives a beneficial result. Combining cetuximab with FOLFIRI
showed better results in terms of survival as compared to only the FOLFIRI
regimen. Using cetuximab to maintain the effect after a combination of FOLFOX
and cetuximab shows good results but does not increase survival remarkably.

Cetuximab being a chimeric antibody of human and murine origin, may induce
immunogenicity, which would reduce the effectiveness of treatment. To combat
this disadvantage, a fully humanized antibody panitumumab was developed. It
reduced the incidence of hypersensitivity in patients. As compared to the
FOLFOX and panitumumab combination, adding panitumumab to FOLFOX
made a huge difference in terms of progression-free survival. Both these drugs are
first-line therapy for colorectal carcinoma. But panitumumab is better as
compared to cetuximab, where it gives similar results and is economical. When
30 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Gore et al.
used as second-line treatment, these drugs are not very efficient [9].
BRAF Inhibitors

BRAF is a gene for the formation of a protein called B-RAF. It is a proto-
oncogene that helps in the progression of cancer upon activation. Melanomas in
colorectal cancers show overexpressed and mutated BRAF. BRAF inhibition
showed good results in melanoma caused by mutated BRAF-V600E, but similar
results were not achieved for colorectal cancers. Blocking BRAF or BRAF/MEK
using vemurafenib and dabrafenib did not give good results even when the
downstream actions of MAPK were blocked. Such a blockade may trigger EGFR
and activate the RAS pathway, which surpasses the MAPK pathway and
continues with the growth. A combination of cetuximab, irinotecan, and
vemurafenib showed good results in colorectal cancers with mutated BRAF.
Based on clinical studies, using a BRAF gene inhibitor and an upstream signaling
inhibitor is shown to have great efficacy. Triple regimens, including dabrafenib,
trametinib, and panitumumab had a great response [10].

HER-2 Inhibitors

HER has many pathways similar to EGFR and is overexpressed to counter EGFR
resistance. The incidence of overexpression of HER-2 is as low as 2% in
colorectal carcinoma. Therapy targeting EGFR and HER may be beneficial in
such cases where the effect produced is more significant than any of them alone.
Dual targeted HER-2 therapy containing one HER2 inhibitor, such as trastuzumab
and one dimerization inhibitor like pertuzumab showed increased response rates
[11].

Targeting VEGF

Angiogenesis is an important event in malignancies that includes the formation or
re-formation of blood vessels from an original local network. This process is
regulated by many factors promoting and opposing angiogenesis, such as
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, fibroblast growth factor, TGF-a, TGF-f.
VEGF interacts with other proteins such as integrins to control angiogenesis.

VEGF family contains 5 variants- types A, B, C, D, and placental growth factor.
These attach to the cell membrane through a tyrosine kinase receptor. VEGF
receptors are of 3 types- VEGFR-1, 2, 3. Non tyrosine kinase receptors of the
same family include neuropilin- NP-1 and NP-2 receptors [12].

Bevacizumab

Bevacizumab is an immunoglobulin-G type of antibody. It is targeted against
Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 31

VEGF-A. It improves survival without progression and overall survival in
metastasizing colorectal cancer. This drug used in combination with monotherapy
or with combinations such as FOLFOX or FOXFIRE, showed only partial
improvement in the case of overall survival and progression-free survival. It is
much safer in elderly patients. Tumors located on either the left or right side of
the colon respond equally well to this drug. This medication is mostly used as
first-line medicine. But, bevacizumab is effective as a second-line medicine with
combinations such as FOLFOX. This combination is more effective than either
bevacizumab or FOLFOX alone. After its use as a first-line agent, bevacizumab is
also a good option for maintaining the therapeutic outcome after first-line therapy
[13].

Novel anti-VEGFR Agents

Aflibercept is a novel VEGFR-1 and 2 inhibitors. It is present in the extracellular
part of VEGFR and is a recombinant fusion protein. It blocks and acts as a trap
against VEGF- A and B, PIGF. It has a better likeliness of VEGF-A than even
bevacizumab. It does not show adequate results when used alone but shows good
results in combination. As it increases adverse effects as a first-line drug, it should
be limited to second-line use only. Ramucirumab is another novel antibody to
target VEGF. It is a humanized immunoglobulin-G. It is used as a second-line
treatment for colorectal cancer. It is used along with the FOLFIRI regimen, which
has been proven effective. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are novel drugs being used
against colorectal carcinoma but have very little effect. Regorafenib is a drug that
targets receptors for multiple hormones such as VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and BRAF.
It was used as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. When used in
combination with FOLFOX, it showed no significant results [14].

HGF/C-MET Pathway

A hepatocyte growth factor is secreted by mesenchymal cells, which promotes
growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis of cells. It attaches to a tyrosine
kinase receptor called a mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor. This molecule
has an important role to play in angiogenesis, tumour proliferation, and
metastasis. This receptor is overexpressed in a number of cancers, including
hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and
esophageal cancer. To target this specific pathway, many molecules have been
derived with many possible mechanisms. Drugs that target HGF either prevent the
activation or production of HGF or they interfere with binding to MET receptors.
When agents are directed against MET receptors, they either show competitive
binding or inhibit the activity of tyrosine kinase within the cell [15].
32 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Gore et al.
HGF Inhibitors

HGF can show its actions only after the activation of pro-HGF caused by a group
of inhibitors called HGF activator inhibitors (HAIs). There are no molecules
clinically approved for use. Rather than blocking, it’s better to prevent binding to
MET receptors by nullifying the activity of receptors altogether. Some antibodies
have been synthesized in this direction. Rilotumumab is an immunoglobulin-G
that is humanized. When used in phases one and two of clinical trials, it showed
increased survival without progression of disease in patients but was not
successful in phase three studies [16].

MET Antagonists

These are the molecules that compete with HGF at the binding site and show
competition for binding to the receptor site. This improper binding causes an
abnormal dimerization of the receptor and degrades it. Many antibodies have been
synthesized targeting this receptor such as onartuzumab. Onartuzumab is an
antibody isolated from murine species. It specifically binds to the semaphoring
domain of the MET receptor. It was tested in patients who presented with solid
tumours such as NSCLC, colorectal carcinoma, and glioblastoma. It showed
enhanced survival time. DN-30, another antibody binds to the IPT region of the
MET receptor and inhibits proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer. ABT-
700 is a humanized antibody. It causes size reduction in gastric tumours with
overexpressed MET. It was decided as safe in phase 1 trials [17].

TKIs

These are molecules that inhibit MET due to their structural similarity to the
tyrosine kinase enzyme. Agents such as tivantinib, savolitinib, volitinib
selectively target the MET kinase domain. On the other hand, agents like
crizontinib and carbozantinib attack the receptor non-selectively. Tivantinib is a
drug that selectively binds to MET and prevents it from becoming active. It
imparts the growth of tumors. Tivantinib was used alone or with sorafenib and
was used along with erlotinib in a phase three trial on NSCLC. Those suffering
from liver cancer with overexpressed MET showed better survival. In the case of
metastatic CRC, no significant effect was shown. Many such molecules have been
developed and have shown excellent results in various cancers, but the evidence
against colorectal carcinoma is low [18].

IMMUNE CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE

Usually, targeting a tumour involves pathways contributing to tumour growth, but
targeting those pathways which facilitate recognition of a tumour by the immune
Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 33

system and initiate its destruction is also equally effective. Cancer cells show
abnormally overexpressed genes and are targeted and destroyed by the immune
system [19]. This process involves the identification of antigens by immune cells,
presenting those antigens using MHC complexes, identification of those antigens
by T cells, secreting chemicals, and activating T-cells. Cancer cells can escape
this immune attack due to immunosuppressive factors secretion, activation of
regulatory cells, and reduced expression of MHC to reduce immune identification.
Another important mechanism is exhausting or inactivating tumor-related T-cells
by activating co-inhibitory receptors on cancer cell surface such as programmed
death-1(PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA-4) [20]. Expression of
these receptors causes flooding of tumours with CD4 T-cells which suppress the
other tumour cells. According to the tumor, regulatory T cells expressing the PD-
1 receptor are important in homeostasis and tolerance to the immune system in
CRC [21].

The first successful PD-1 blocker against colorectal cancer, which is devoid of
MMR, was pembrolizumab. It is a humanized Ig4 antibody for metastatic CRC
treatment. Patients with a d MMR CRC show a better response to pembrolizumab
as compared to those with a pMMR colorectal carcinoma. It also showed
antitumour activity in a phase-1 clinical trial against an MSH CRC. The combined
therapy of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab showed no significant results in
colorectal cancer. Nivolumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody. It is an Ig4
antibody against PD-1 overexpressed cancers. In a study, around 67% of patients
showed proper disease control. Overall survival and progression-free survival
were also reported. Furthermore, combined with the CLTA-4 inhibitor,
ipilimumab outperformed a single immune checkpoint treatment [22].

ADJUVANT AND NEOADJUVANT THERAPY USING TARGETED
MEDICINE

Fluoropyrimidine-based therapy helps patients prevent re-emergence of tumours
and enhance survival. Because stage 3 cancers have a better prognosis, such
adjuvant therapies have a greater effect than stage 2 cancers. Stage-2 colorectal
cancers showing microsatellite instability do not respond to adjuvant
chemotherapy. Advanced cancers such as those at stage-4, those showing invasion
in peritoneum/vasculature, stage-3 tumours can be treated with FOLFOX or
CAPOX therapy. In such cases, adjuvant therapy is used to reduce any possible
side effects. A phase-3 clinical trial was conducted on bevacizumab used with
either CAP, XELOX, or FOLFOX and none of the three therapies showed
satisfactory results. Similarly, adding cetuximab to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI showed
no effect. According to this data, no significant effect was observed for the use of
targeted therapy as adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant therapies should be used for
34 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Gore et al.

colon cancer with metastasis and rectal cancer of stages 2-4 to prevent a
recurrence. Targeted agents are used as novel weapons against cancer. Anti-EFGR
agents were tested in a phase-2 clinical trial against KRAS-wild type CRC with
resectable metastatic CRC. Using cetuximab before and after operation along with
chemotherapy did not show any significant results. In another clinical trial, in
patients with KRAS-wild type CRC with metastasis, chemotherapy with
cetuximab may contribute to tumour resection and longer survival periods as
compared to another group. Hence, it does not give any clear indications about the
use of targeted medicines as neo-adjuvant medicine. For locally progressed
cancer, many trials have been conducted on anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR [23].

CONCLUSION

Chemotherapy has been used against cancer for a very long time. Chemotherapy
involves the administration of molecules that act against multiple components and
cellular processes, causing the growth of cancer. The regimens change according
to stage of cancer, where the components and strengths change. There has been a
significant rise in molecules that can target various parts of cell. This has made
chemotherapy a lot more effective.

Abstract: Surgery is one of the primary methods for the removal of colorectal cancers.
Various surgeries are performed based on the location of cancer and its spread. Due to
many shortcomings of extensively invasive procedures, laparoscopy was invented to
visualize cancer perfectly and later remove that tumor. However, some technical
difficulties were observed, and the physiological complexity of the tumour site caused
this method to fail. Later, the FDA announced the approval of a surgical system
operated by a team of specialists. This system has more enhanced precision compared
to conventional treatments, showing increased efficacy.

Keywords: Efficacy, Laparoscopy, Local excision, Side effects, Surgical system,
TME.

INTRODUCTION

Along with chemo and radiotherapy, surgery is another effective treatment for the
removal of colorectal cancer. Surgeries are useful in removing tumors that have
invaded into deeper layers or, if detected early, can even completely remove the
malignancy. Surgical techniques improved with time to give more efficacy and
reduced incision size as larger incisions are associated with greater discomfort.
This chapter shows such evolution of surgical systems for the treatment of
colorectal cancer.

There are many options for surgical removal of rectal cancers.

TOTAL MESORECTAL EXCISION

TME is a broad term used for surgeries to remove rectal cancer. The procedure
involves removal of mesentery near as well as far away from the tumour. It is
removed sharply while taking care of the autonomic neural network in the area,

maintaining hemostasis, and the integrity of the mesorectal envelope. It is carried
out under the rationale that maximum spread of rectal cancer is not beyond
mesentery, and removal of mesentery may help prevent the spread further [1].

Techniques Abdominoperineal Resection

Abdominoperineal Resection involves a midline incision through which the
abdominal cavity can be accessed. The lymph nodes in the area are examined to
assess the spread of tumours. In ureter, gonadal vessels are pushed upwards, and
colon and mesocolon are pulled down. The arteries and bowels are ligated while
taking care not to harm any organ during that process. Then the mesentery is
dissected, starting from the sides and coming to the middle part of the mesentery.
Nerves are pushed to the side. Next, the position of the perineum is ensured. The
rectum is cleaned, the anus is closed tightly, and an elliptical cut is given around
the anus. The ligaments present before the coccyx are divided and the surgeon,
with his finger, pulls down the perineum. The excision starts at the backside,
comes to the front from the sides. After the removal of cancer, the ligatures on
blood vessels are removed and the layers are sewn [2].

Coloanal Anastomosis

This procedure is important for tumors that are present near the sphincter. This
procedure enables a surgeon to successfully remove a tumor without harming the
sphincter. This is done for the patient suffering from rectal cancer, which is a
distal position and has not yet invaded muscular layers of the sphincter and for
whom, anterior resection is not possible. The rectum is cut at a distal angle near
the pelvic muscles. The remaining muscles are removed and the diseased area is
removed. The ends are sewn to restore connectivity [3].

LOCAL EXCISION

Low anterior resection and abdominal perineal resection are majorly used for the
removal of rectal cancers, but they usually come with many risks, such as high
mortality and morbidity. Hence, the method for local excision to remove the
tumour is gaining an advantage [4].

Transanal Excision

For cancers present lower side, local excision is made transverse to the anus. After
anesthesia, the patient is made to sleep on his/her stomach. The buttocks are
pushed apart. Pudendal nerves are blocked to reduce pain. A retractor is used to
expose the lesion inside the anus. Sutures are placed 1-2 cm away from a tumour
and a line marking the dissection site is drawn. The tissues are cut using
Robotics for Rectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 39

electrocautery. The lesion is cut while taking care not to harm the other structures.
After removal, the excision is filled with polyglycolic structures and sealed [5].

Transcoccygeal Excision

This approach is used for lesions in the middle or distal portion of the rectum. The
patient is administered general anaesthesia and made to lie in a prone position.
The buttocks are kept apart for the comfort of the surgeon. The patient is draped
and sterilized using iodine solution. A cut is made in the posterior along the
middle line near the coccyx and sacrum. As the coccyx lies near to the skin, to
reach it, the layers such as ligaments are cut from the side and posterior end of the
coccyx. The coccyx is pushed to the side and cut from the anterior side till
cauterizing wire passes through a sacral coccygeal joint. The coccyx is removed
and any bleeding from the sacral artery is controlled using eclectrocauterizing.
Levitator muscles and a fat layer are moved to reach the rectum [6].

For posterior tumors, the distal portion of tumour can be felt using fingers. After
that, the rectum and mesorectum are cut transversally by 1-1.5 cm away from the
tumour. For posterior tumours, this method allows the removal of perirectal
nodes. For lesions in the front side, the rectum is cut from the posterior side, and
the lesion is exposed clearly. The perianal fat along with the lesion is separated by
a radius of 1-1.5 cm around the lesion [6].

Transsphincteric Excision

It involves dissection of the sphincter as well as posterior rectal wall. It is similar
to transcoccygeal excision except that now the levator ani and sphincter muscles
are divided along the midline. These muscles are re-positioned carefully so they
can be sewn back at the end of the procedure. Care has to be taken to not damage
the nerve supply to the anus and rectum. After the removal of the lesion, the
layers are sewn back again [7].

Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery

This procedure is performed with the help of a special rectoscope. An obturator
was placed before the insertion of a microscope. A glass faceplate is used to hold
the position for the insertion of a microscope. The scope is inserted and the glass
plate is removed. Carbon dioxide is blown into the rectum to distend it.
Epinephrine is injected to allow hemostasis. The margin of resection of 1-1.5cm
around the lesion is marked and resected along with the fat layer present around
the rectum. The wound is sewn using absorbable sutures [8].

DISADVANTAGES OF SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR RECTAL
CANCER

Surgery for rectal cancer should be done considering factors like size of operation
and health of the patient before the surgery.

Short Term Effects of Surgery

Bleeding

Infections at the site of surgery

Blood clots in the leg [9]

Long Term Effects

The postoperative pain may remain for a long time and reduces the quality of life.

The sutures in the colon or rectum may leak, causing pain, fever, belly pain, and
loss of appetite. Such leakage may cause difficulty in passing stools.

Such leakage may lead to infection.

Development of scar tissues may cause organs to stick together, showing
adhesion; such adhesions may cause blockade of bowels hence causing pain and
swelling.

Surgeries like APR may affect the reproductive system in males, ultimately
leading to infertility and may reduce the functioning of sexual organs.

In females, adhesions may cause pain in the pelvic area [10].
LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY

Laparoscopy was first used for colorectal cancer in 1990. Initially, it was not
accepted rapidly due to oncologic considerations. Now, it is widely used due to its
results equivalent to open surgery when performed by experienced surgeons [11].

ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL SURGICAL METHODS

Short Term Advantages Are:

Laparoscopic surgery reduces post-operative pain experienced by patients after
the surgery.

Laparoscopic surgeries require less time as compared to conventional surgical
Robotics for Rectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 41
methods and hence patients require a shorter stay in the hospital.

As a smaller incision is made on the bowels, it heals faster, allowing the fast
return of bowel function.

Side effects such as leakage from anastomosis were lower in laparoscopic
surgeries than in conventional ones.

The incidence of infections at the site of incision is lower than that observed in
conventional surgeries.

Intrasurgery blood loss is reduced in case of laparoscopic surgery.

The surgical outcomes in laparoscopic surgery improve with the experience of the
surgeon [12].

Long Term Advantages
The laparoscopic method ensures longer postoperative survival.

As compared to open surgery, post-operative inflammation is not observed
frequently in laparoscopic surgery.

Genitourinary functions are not disturbed due to smaller incisions and accurate
surgery [13].

Limitations of Laparoscopic Surgery

Lack of touch makes proper examination of tumour difficult, which may increase
the time required for surgery.

Lack of stereo vision in laparoscopy makes it difficult to visualize large tumours.

Some physiological complications such as a narrow pelvis, large tumours,
presence of tumour on the lower side of the rectum may cause problems in
successful visualization and extraction of tumour [14].

Surgeries of the large intestine using laparoscopy are more complex and may not
always be feasible.

Even after such a sophisticated procedure, chances of recurrence of cancer are still
there.

The presence of an anastomosis takes a longer time to heal and hence may
increase the duration of hospitalization.
42 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Saindane et al.

The laparoscopic surgery may not be effective due to the presence of factors such
as improper tumour clearance.

There is a constant threat of tumour dissemination during surgery which may aid
metastasis of tumour.

Laparoscopic surgery may have unique side effects such as gas embolism, port
side hernias [15].

ROBOTIC SURGERY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER

As per literature, laparoscopic surgery is better than conventional open surgical
options due to improved early outcomes after surgery. But in the case of long-
term effects such as survival time, disease-free survival showed no significant
increase compared to open surgeries. Some studies indicated the presence of
circumferential resection margin, which is an indication of recurrence of cancer.
Even during surgery, a fine section of the pelvic bone may cause bleeding and
damage to surrounding organs as well as many technical difficulties that may
arise during handling of the instrument. In this scenario, the USFDA approved the
‘da Vinci surgical system’ for robotic surgeries for the removal of colorectal
carcinomas [16].

Components of the da Vinci surgical System
A surgeon’s console with controls to move the surgical system.

A patient cart to allow patients to lie down and attached with four robotic arms
that perform the surgery.

A high-performance vision system containing endo-wrist instruments to allow
precise control of the robotic arms to facilitate surgeries [17].

Operation of the System

This system is managed by a team that includes surgeon, two assistants, an
anesthesiologist, a surgical technician, and nurses. They all work together to
manage the system. The anaesthesiologist first gives general anaesthesia to a
patient, which ensures complete sedation. Then, based on the results of previous
imaging tests such as CT scans, the surgeon decides the position of the section to
reach the tumor. After the section is made, a doctor inserts the robotic arms inside
the section with the help of two masters. One arm is an endoscope that gives
1000fps images, which even reduces the background noise. The view angles can
be changed with a foot peddle. The surgical arms are connected to special
instruments called endo-wrist, which allow the movement of robotic arms
Robotics for Rectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 43

according to the hand movements of the surgeon. The robotic arms have a wider
range of movements, including complete round movement. The instrument senses
the hand movements made by a surgeon. It converts them into micro-movements
in the robotic arms. The system even detects any irregular hand movements and
removes them to avoid any errors during surgery [18].

OUTCOMES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM

Short Term Outcomes

Operation time significantly increases in robotic surgery due to complex handling
of the da Vinci system.

Estimated blood loss during the surgery was found to be reduced and a reduction
in instances of perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion was observed which
reduced the need for blood transfusion and hence reduced the incidence of
infections.

Although robotic surgeries reported low conversion rates to open or laparoscopic
surgery, the evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Anastomotic
leakage is one of the major problems related to surgeries for colorectal cancer. A
study reported no significant difference in incidences of anastomotic leakage in
robotic, laparoscopic, or open surgeries. But such data should be evaluated
carefully for the selection of patients and clinical settings.

Damage to sympathetic nerves during surgery may cause problems in urogenital
function, which may affect the postoperative quality of life of patients. In the case
of robotic surgeries, technical advances like 3D visualization and freely moving
robotic arms allows a careful surgical procedure without harming any nerves.

Circumferential resection margin(CRM) is the phenomenon of finding tumor cells
within a radius of 1mm of the resection margin of tumour. Robotic surgery
showed lower incidences of CRM positivity in post-surgical bowels as compared
to laparoscopic or open surgery.

A distal margin of 1cm is achieved by robotic surgery thanks to its sophisticated
technology [19].

Long Term Outcomes

Local and systemic recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients who
underwent robotic surgery than in those who underwent open or laparoscopic
surgery 5 years later.
44 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Saindane et al.

The long term oncological outcomes after robotic surgery were comparable to
those after laparoscopic surgery and were found to be favorable for patients.

The survival rates were better for patients who underwent robotic surgery than for
those who underwent conventional or laparoscopic surgery [20].

CONCLUSION

There are many surgical treatments available for colorectal carcinoma depending
upon various factors, such as its position , spread. The surgeries cause various
local as well as some long-term problems such as infection, bleeding, and various
urinary or reproductive system disorders. This led to the discovery of laparoscopic
surgeries which had their limitations due to physiological environments and
technical shortcomings of the instruments. The innovation of the ‘Da Vinci
surgical system’ caused a revolution in surgery for colorectal cancer due to
advantages such as reduced conversion and improved outcomes post-surgery. Its
short and long-term advantages clearly show its superiority above other surgical
techniques.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease that is initiated by the interrelation of
genetic and environmental factors. Colorectal cancer progresses through the
accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes. This review discusses, in detail, the
role of IncRNAs in colorectal cancer, focusing on various signaling pathways involved
in colorectal cancer pathogenesis, viz., Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF-IR)
signaling pathway (KRAS and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways),
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program.

Keywords: Apoptosis, Colorectal cancer, LncRNAs, Signalling pathway.
INTRODUCTION

Cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that can affect any portion of the body.
The rapid formation of abnormal cells is the defining feature of cancer, and then it
enters adjoining parts of the body and escalates to other organs; the last process is
stated as metastasizing [1]. Cancer metastases are the leading cause of death [2].
According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2018,
around 9.6 million deaths were estimated worldwide, and 7.6 million deaths were
estimated in 2008 from cancer [3]. Some common types of cancer found in males
are lung, prostate, colorectal stomach, and liver cancer [4]. Breast cancer,
colorectal cancer, lung cancer, cervical cancer, and thyroid cancer are some of the
most common types of cancer in women [5]. Changing one’s lifestyle and
adopting healthier habits could prevent nearly 30% of cancer deaths [6]. Based on

the report of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published
on September 12", 2018 in “A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,” it has been shown
that the top three types of cancer found in human are lung [7], female breast, and
colorectal (Table 1).

Cancers of the lung and breast account for the majority of cases globally; in 2018,
an estimated 2.1 million people were diagnosed with these diseases. Second, in
terms of several instances, colorectal cancer has 1.8 million cases and is 10.2% of
all cancers diagnosed; prostate has 1.3 million cases and is 7.1%; and stomach
cancer is fifth in terms of the number of cases (1.0 million cases, 5.7 percent) [7].
It has been estimated that around 1.2 million patients are diagnosed every year
with colorectal cancer [8] (Hermann Brenner ef ai.).

As a multifactorial illness, colorectal cancer (CRC) may be divided into several
subtypes based on the relative weight given to each of these risk factors [9]. Only
a very small percentage of CRCs are caused by hereditary types of the disease,
which accounts for 70% to 80% of cases (Binefa G ef al. Colorectal cancer
prevention and treatment) [10]. The accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
alterations is how colorectal cancer grows (Fig. (1)). Adenoma-carcinoma
transition period is around 10-15 years, which indicates the time available to
discover and remove these adenomas before they become invasive carcinomas
[11]. Carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is now being debated in three

primary ways [12].

The first route is known as the “pathway of chromosomal instability” [13]. This
path involves the accumulation of mutations that activate oncogenes (KRAS) and
inactivate suppressor genes (DCC, APC, SMAD4, TP53) [14]. DNA replication
mistakes accumulate owing to mutations in genes that are responsible for
correcting them (MSH 2,6,3, MLH 1,3, PMS 1,2, and Exol) [15] and third route
known as “aberrant hypermethylation, a mechanism to silence gene function”.
The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) refers to dinucleotide methylation
in numerous gene promoter regions [16]. The CIMP accounts for 15%-20% of
sporadic CRC [17]. CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1 are all
considered CIMP-positive indicators if they are methylated [18]. Nearly two-
thirds (60%) of all instances of colon cancer occur in industrialized nations, with
the highest incidence in Japan. In part, this low death rate can be attributed to the
implementation of a screening programme in 1992 [19] (Table 2), one of the first
in the world, along with Italy and Israel. CRC is the third most common disease in
Europe and is the main cause of deaths due to cancer in the country [20].

CRC diagnosis and therapy can only progress if new molecular markers are
developed. Cell death, invasion, differentiation, and cell growth arrest are all
influenced by TGF-f, a transforming growth factor [21]. Through an epithelial-
mesenchymal transition, TGF-B promotes cancer cell invasion and migration.
TGF-B blocking may be a potential treatment for a variety of cancers, including
colorectal cancer (CRC) [22]. Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs, >200) have been
found as being able to influence TGF-f signaling, mostly through influencing
gene expression. NLIPMT (also known as RP11-115N4.1), a new IncRNA, has
been identified as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, according to recent
research. To combat breast cancer metastasis, NLIPMT deactivates GSK-3p
(glycogen synthase kinase 38). GSK-3B has been shown to control TGF-B.
Because of this, NLIPMT and TGF-f may interact with one another [23].

LNCRNA IN COLORECTAL CANCER

controlling gene expression and altering cellular homeostasis (Fig. 2) [24].
Various cancers, including hematological, urologic, lung, liver, breast, ovarian,
and colorectal, have been linked to unchecked cell proliferation and
overexpression of IncRNAs [25]. By modifying these molecules [26], it may be
possible to develop biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic use in
colorectal cancer. As important clinical and mechanistic agents, several IncRNAs
are strongly linked to colon cancer. Additionally, the GAS5 transcript is located at
1q25 and has a 630nt length [27]. Due to the absence of growth hormones or
serum starvation, GASS5 expression is elevated [28]. There is evidence that GAS5
acts as a decoy glucocorticoid response element (GRE) for the
glucocorticoidreceptor (GR) and collaborates with DNA GREs in binding to the
GR [29]. The IncRNA acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell formation and
promoting apoptosis. GAS5 is downregulated in a variety of cancers, including
breast, prostate, and renal carcinoma, according to recent studies [30]. So far,
research has established that Gas5 is downregulated in murine colorectal cancer
tissues and that this is linked to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, lower
histological grade, and a shorter overall survival time. As a result, GAS5
overexpression has been shown to reduce cell proliferation (in vitro and in vivo),
inhibit cell migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis, which increases
expression of the A pho-casp9 protein and inhibits the production of pho-casp3
protein [31]. Using the GAS5/miR-182-5p/FOXO3a axis, GASS can inhibit
apoptosis. A further study has shown that GAS5 functions as a ceRNA of miR-
18-5p, which regulates the FOXO3 gene and targets the PI3k-AKT signaling
pathway directly [32].

HOTAIR

HOTAIR (Homeobox Transcript Antisense Intergenic RNA), a 2.2 kb IncRNA, is
transcribed from the human HOXC gene group situated in 12q13.13 [33]. It
contributes to epigenetic regulation of gene transcription and intermingles on its
5’ end with polycomb repressive complex 2 in order to remodel chromatin and
guarantee the silence of HOX genes at the stage of embryonic development [34]
(Table 3).

The transcription of enhancer RNAs can be done in one of two ways. Nearly all protein-coding genes have
1D-eRNAs and 2D-eRNAs at their transcriptional enhancers; (B) LncRNA and neighboring protein-coding
genes can be transcribed on different sides of the nucleotide, (C) When a protein-coding gene is found in the
intron of a IncRNA, it overlaps;(D) It is intragenic when the whole sequence of the IncRNA is within the
intron of a protein-coding gene; (E) A transcript can be considered antisense when it is positioned between
one or more exons of another transcript on the same strand, (F) When two genes have the same IncRNA
sequence, it is intergenic.

Histone demethylase is found on all three sides of HOTAIR. HOTAIR has been
identified to play an oncogenic function in renal, breast, stomach, lung, and
ovarian carcinomas, according to the indication [35]. HOTAIR is overexpressed
at greater levels in CRC samples, but other research shows that HOTAIR is only
overexpressed in the right (proximal) CRC samples [36]. Patients with lymph
nodes, tumors, and distant metastases have a worse survival rate because of this
overregulation. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration are reduced, as are
CDK2 and cyclin E expression; apoptosis is increased and p21 expression is
52 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Setia et al.

increased when it is inhibited in vitro. As a result, HOTAIR is linked to cancer
and violence [37]. LncRNA FUT6 modulates the production of FUT6, a fructosyl
transferase, via directing miR326 binding sites to FUT6. The 1,3-fucosylation of
CD44 is altered by the HOTAIR/miR-326/FUT6 axis, which activates the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in CRC malignancy [38]. CRC cell lines
expressing miR-203a-3p have decreased chemoresistance and cell proliferation
after the downregulation of HOTAIR and the overexpression of miR-203a-3p in
the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway [39].

H19

H19 gene is situated on 11p15 and plays vital role [40] (Table 3) in embryonal
development and growth regulation. The H19 gene encodes a processed 2.7kb
RNA [41]. When an embryo is developing, H19 is more prevalent in the fetal
adrenal, liver, and placenta, but decreases in the postnatal period [42]. H19 has
been found to be upregulated in variety of cancers including oesophageal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, and breast cancer,
according to current literature [43]. Colorectal cancer cells have been shown to
have an increased expression of H19, which is connected to surrounding non-
tumor tissues, according to the literature study [44]. The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) data reveals that H19 is the IncRNA with the greatest substantial
correlation to colorectal cancer patient existence and serves as an autonomous
predictor for OS and disease-free survival (DFS) [45]. To further reduce CRC cell
proliferation, miR-200a can inhibit the production of H19 by binding to it [46].

LncRNA Function

Sponging miR-204-5p can reduce the susceptibility of CRC cells to 5-FU, resulting in
decreased apoptosis. Furthermore, UCAI expression levels are elevated in Cetuximab
resistant cells and can be transmitted to sensitive cells via exosomes, hence boosting
the number of Cetuximab resistant cells.

MiR-193a-3p sponges, activate AKT signaling, which promotes cell survival and
chemoresistance, in Oxaliplatin and 5-FU chemoresistance. CRC development,
metastasis, cell survival, and chemoresistance are all regulated by miR-193a-3p.
Cisplatin and Paclitaxel resistance might be improved by targeting miR-203a-3p and
the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway with HOTAIR.

PCAT-1 influences CRC cell invasion and 5-FU resistance and that PCAT-1
modulates c-Myc expression may increase CRC cell invasion.

PVTI inhibits apoptosis and upregulates the expression of MRP1, P-gp, mTOR, and
Bel-2 in human colon cancer tissues and cells.

Sponging miR-124 from SGK1 causes Doxorubicin resistance via enhancing cell
survival, loss of cell cycle control, inhibition of apoptosis, and chemoresistance.
MALATI promotes chemoresistance by potentiating multidrug-resistant genes such

UCAI MDRI, MRP1, BCRP, and ABC in 5-FU resistant cells. The EZH2 pathway in Oxa
LINC00152 resistance is also modulated.
HOTAIR For MTX-resistant CRC, H19 is a prospective therapeutic target because of its ability
PCAT-1 to activate Wnt/b-catenin signaling. To make the tumor more resistant to
PVT1 chemotherapy, CAFs transfer exosomal H19 to cells that are vulnerable to the disease
XIST via sponging miR-141.
MALATI1 Chemosensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU and DOX is promoted by SLC25A25-AS1
H19 participation in Erk and p38 pathway regulation in CRC cells. As a result, the
SLC25A25-AS1 involvement of SLC25A25-AS1 in CRC tumor suppression was established.

PVT1 Competitive sponging to miR-31, which targets ABCB9, lowered 5-FU's
MEG3 chemoresistance via apoptosis, as demonstrated by ENST00000547547. For 5-F-

In colorectal cancer, TUGI causes MTX resistance by sponging miR-186, which
targets CPEB2 and raises its protein levels, which play a significant role in
carcinogenesis and chemoresistance.

In CRC, PVT1 is a key regulator of carcinogenesis and cisplatin resistance, and it may
be a viable target for CRC treatment.

Using MEG3 to induce cytotoxicity in CRC cells and increase apoptosis, Oxa
chemosensitivity can be improved. PDCD4 is the target of miR-141, which MEG3
also sponges up.

It has been discovered that H19 regulates B-catenin expression and activity by
competing with miRNA-200a for binding [47]. Cell viability is impaired when
H19 is depleted, on the other hand, and causes growth arrest. Yet, ,
overexpression of H19 upregulates a series of cell cycle genes. elF4A3 binding by
H19 causes an aberrant cell cycle regulating gene expression [48]. The RAS-
MAPK signaling pathway is activated by H19 overexpression in MTX-resistant
colorectal cell lines, which enhances CRC invasion and metastasis. Methotrexate
54 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Setia et al.

(MTX) resistance is linked to the activation of Wnt/b-catenin signaling by HT-29
[49]. Together, H19 and miR-675 in colorectal cancer indicate that they are
critical players in carcinogenesis, whereas H19 generated miR-675, a target tumor
suppressor, was shown to be overexpressed in colorectal cancer [50]. H19, on the
other hand, is highly expressed in mesenchymal-like cancer cells and primary
CRC tissues, whereas its persistent expression promotes tumor development and
enhances the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [51]. For the final role as a
ceRNA, H19 may antagonize miR-138 and miR200a, resulting in the de-
repression of Vimentin, ZEB1, and the ZEB2 gene [31]. One of the most
important prognostic factors in patients with stage-one lung cancer is transcript 1,
which is located on 11q13 and transcribed from the nuclear-enriched transcript 2
(NEAT2). In healthy human and animal tissues, this IncRNA is present, but its
overexpression has been linked to a variety of cancers, including lung, cervical,
liver, and bladder sarcomas, and is associated with metastasis [52].

MALAT 1

MALAT1 levels found to be 2.26 times higher in humanoid primary CRC tissues
[ 53 ] ( Table 3 ), acting as a negative prognostic marker in stage HAI CRC
patients [54]. Furthermore, this type of patient has a higher risk ratio for both
overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS). MALAT1 have also been found
to be elevated in CRC tissues with lymph node metastases, as well [55]. It has
been shown in vitro that MALATI can promote CRC cell proliferation, invasion,
and migration via increasing SOX9 and reducing miR-145 [56]. Apoptosis can be
prevented when the MALAT1/miR-145/SOX9 pathway is disrupted. SFPQ and
AKAP-9 may play a role in the regulation of MALATI in naked mice since
MALATI interferes with SFPQ and AKAP-9, respectively [56]. As a result,
PTBP2 is freed from the SFPQ/PTBP2 complex, allowing cells to grow and
migrate more easily. Human primary colon cancer tissues with lymph node
metastases have high levels of AKAP-9, a protein that suppresses the growth of
CRC cells as well as the movement and invasion of MALAT1-stimulated CRC
cells [57]. Mapping the YAP1-induced MALAT1-miR126-5p pathway in CRC
promotes metastasis by enhancing angiogenesis and EMT, as well as the
formation of TCF4 YAP1 complexes that act as sponges for miR-126-5p to
induce SLUG, VEGFA, and TWIST expression. MiR-20b-5p mimic and si-
MALAT1 inhibit microsphere development and self-renewal, decrease CSCs, and
downregulate stemness markers miR-20b-5p-mimic (miR-20b-5p-mimic) and si-
MALATI [58].While HCT-116 tumorigenicity was suppressed in a xenograft
model using BALB/c mice, si-MALATI or miR-20b-5p-mimic were able to
overpower it in-vitro [59].

INVOLVEMENT OF LNCRNAS IN CRC PATHOGENESIS

Multistage carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a well-known fact. CRC
develops from a benign adenoma in the mucosal epithelium to a malignant tumor
[60]. LncRNAs based on their functions as illustrated in Fig. (3).

IncRNA

Roe

IncRNA

Fig. (3). For LncRNAs, classification is based on their roles. There are several roles that LncRNAs play in
nuclear transcription, epigenetic control, and nuclear structure. A variety of roles have been assigned to
LncRNA in cytoplasmic functions, including mRNA translation enhancing, the scaffolding of the protein
complex, miR-based sponges, and producers of endo siRNA.

Several pathways are involved in CRC progression, including the Wnt/-catenin
signaling pathway, the EGFR/IGF-IR signaling pathway (KRAS and
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), TGF-B signaling, p53 signaling, and EMT

program [62] (Fig. (4)).

catenin activation, EGFR/IGF-IR (KRAS and PI3K) activation, TGF-B/SMAD signalling activation, p53
inhibition, and EMT activation are all influenced by IncRNAs in CRC pathogenesis.

Wnt/B-Catenin Pathway

The start of CRC occurs when the Wnt/B-catenin pathway in the body is disrupted
[63]. Wnt signaling is controlled by a variety of proteins, including Axin, GSK-3,
APC, CK1, PP2A, and AP-2, all of which are involved in the catenin annihilation
complex [64]. It boosts Wnt signalling by releasing free B-catenin from the
annihilation complex and then activating TCF/LEF targets like cyclin D1, E2F
transcription factor-4, and the proto-oncogene c-Myc, which activates the
TCF/LEF signalling pathway [65]. Wnt-signaling occurs in more than 80% of
sporadic CRCs when a suppressive gene, such as APC, is inactivated [66].
IncRNA H19 has been shown to influence the activity of the APC gene. During
embryogenesis, oncofetal H19 is active, but it is deactivated post-natally and
reactivated during cancer. Several proteins belong to the AP-2a family that
collaborates to destroy $-catenin [67]. This protein is an oncosuppressive protein
via its interaction with APC and f-catenin in vitro and in vivo investigations [68].
Oncosupptessive genes and the cell cycle (GI/S transition) are both controlled by
Colorectal Cancer Management Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 57

the E2F4 family of transcription factors. HCT116 B-catenin-stimulated CRC cells
have the E2F4 antisense transcript [69]. The 3'-UTR sequences of E2F4 could be
fixed by -catenin and TCF4 together, driving expression of this IncRNA, which
minimizes E2F4 stages and declines binding of E2F4 to promoters of targets like
PCNA and cyclin A2, ultimately activating the expression of genes that are
repressed by E2F4 expression [70]. The MYC area upstream comprises a large
tumor-type-specific super-enhancer. The 515 kb MYC upstream region
transcribes a human CRC-precise IncRNA CCATI1-L(Table 4). CCATI-L is
called an isoform of the currently termed IncRNA colon cancer-associated
transcript-1 (CCAT1) [71], which is entirely confined in the nucleus, and its
appearance is upregulated in CRC cell lines and CRC tissue samples. In addition,
CCATI-L helps CTCF connect to the MYC locus by interacting with a zinc finger
protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), and promoting positive control of MYC
transcription by interfacing with CTCF [72]. CCAT2 is also overexpressed in
CRC samples that are microsatellite stable (MSS). CCAT2 overexpression is
associated with an increase in MYC expression in CRC cells, while temporary
CCAT2 knockdown reduces MYC expression. As a result, CCAT2 and Wnt
signaling form a complicated feedback loop [73]. CCAT2 can often improve Wnt
effects by binding to TCF7L2 and altering its transcriptional activity at one
location. Instead, TCF7L2 knockdown consistently reduces CCAT2 expression,
indicating that TCF7L2 is essential to maintain higher levels of CCAT2
expression [74].

EGFR/IGF-IR SIGNALING (PI3K AND KRAS PATHWAYS)

EGFR belongs to a member of the human EGFR family of receptor tyrosine
kinases [75]. Colorectal carcinogenesis and progression are influenced by tyrosine
kinase receptors identified in a wide range of solid tumors, including EGFR,
60 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Setia et al.

insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR), and others [76]. Ligand binding at
both EGFR and IGF-IR suggests activation of the KRAS/Raf/MAPK signalling
cascade and the PI3K/AKT signalling pathways, which contribute to uncontrolled
cell proliferation, adhesion, angiogenesis, migration, metastasis, and survival [77].
IGF-dependent gene CRNDE, located on chromosome 16 at hCG 1815491, was
activated in CRC at the earliest possible time, and it was discovered to interact
with chromatin-modifying complexes to influence gene expression [78]. Table 4
shows that CRNDE is a downstream target of both the PI3K and KRAS signal
cascades. The “Warburg effect” is supported by the elevation of CRNDE
expression in neoplastic colon cells, which shifts from oxidative to aerobic
glycolysis [79].

TGF-B SIGNALING PATHWAY

TGF-B is a 25-kDa cytokine that communicates via transmembrane serine-
threonine kinase receptors (STKR) and intracellular SMAD family
mediators. TGF-f has a dual function in the early stages of CRC development.
TGF-B acts as a cancer suppressor and hastens cancer invasiveness in advanced
stages [ 78 ]. Many studies have found that IncRNAs play a role in TGF-B
signalling pathways, which have been linked to several cancers, including
colorectal cancer (CRC). When ncRNAs are overexpressed, TGF-B signalling is
activated. The oncogene PVT-1, which is encoded by the IncRNA PVT-1, has
been linked to cancer pathogenesis in humans [ 80 ]. As a result, proteins involved
in canonical TGF- signalling, and apoptosis appear to have been activated. TGF-
B has also been shown to activate ncRNAs, which is an added benefit. Yuan and
colleagues discovered a new TGF-B induced IncRNA called IncRNA-activated by
TGF-B UncRNA-ATB) that promotes hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and
metastasis via Smad-independent signalling [ 81 ], and ZEB2 are zinc-finger E-
box binding homeobox family members that encode the major transcription
factors that promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-promoting
transcription [ 82 ].

P53. PATHWAY

The “acellular gatekeeper” known as P53, which protects against CRC, is innately
dominant [83]. Not only does P53 promote anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
genes such as P53-elevated modulator of the death of cells (PUMA), but it also
inhibits the genes that govern cell proliferation, such as PLK and apoptosis, which
are both upregulated by P53 (Bcl-2) [84]. CRC is one of several malignancies
where p53 function is reduced, either via p53 mutations or changes in the
pathways that signal to p53 [85]. The link between p53 and the IncRNA network
has been uncovered by long-lasting pieces of evidence. The p53 effectors and
Colorectal Cancer Management Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 61

regulators include many IncRNAs, such as MEG3, MALAT1, p53-eRNAs, and
Wrap53; whereas the p53 regulators include others like Loc28518, IncRNA-p21,
H19, and PANDA [86]. On the human 14q32.3 chromosome lies the maternally
expressed gene-3 (MEG3), which is an imprinted ncRNA with a length of 1595
nucleotides. When MEG3 is activated, it suppresses the activity of the well-
known negative p53 regulator, double mouse minute 2 homolog [78], Finally, it
inhibits CRC etiology and development by regulating the expression of p53
targets. MEG3's appearance is also controlled by epigenetics [86]. Cancers and
cell lines lacking MEG3 are prevalent because of hypermethylation of the MEG3
promoter (including colon cell lines HCT116 and H29). As a result, MEG3 may
serve as a tumor suppressor gene [78]. The IncRNA Loc285194 (sometimes
referred to as LSAMP antisense RNA3) is a p53 effector in contrast to the p53
regulator MEG3 [78]. It was previously discovered that the Loc285194 gene,
located at 3q13.31 and comprising four exons totaling 2105 nt in length, was
downregulated in osteosarcoma samples and therefore said to be downregulated in
CRC samples [78]. Additionally, Liu and colleagues found that the Loc285194
upstream region is a possible p53 transcription target. By binding to and inhibiting
oncogenic miR-211, Loc285194 acts as an endogenous sponge to inhibit CRC cell
proliferation. CRC suppression may be possible with Loc285194, as evidenced by
these findings [87].

EMT PROGRAM

CRC-related death is primarily due to metastatic disease [88]. Preclinical and
clinical studies have shown evidence that the EMT program and its inverse
program are activated throughout the metastatic phase of CRC. N-cadherin is a
hallmark of EMT since E-cadherin (CDH1) is downregulated during the process
[89]. The restored expression levels of IncRNAs lead to the disturbance of the
regulated epithelial equilibrium [90]. Several studies have focused on the role of
IncRNAs in controlling the epithelial phenotype by monitoring EMT-inducing
proteins such as ZEB1, ZEB2, and Snail zinc-finger family members. The
metastasis-associated transcript-l1 (MALAT1) has been identified as a key
mediator of TGF-B induced EMT [91]. Wnt signaling is activated by MALAT1
overexpression during bladder cancer metastasis since MALAT1 overexpression
was previously confirmed to be implicated in the advancement of CRC [92].

DETAIL DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA CONDUCTED FOR
COLORECTAL CANCER (CRC)

IncRNA Overexpression TGF-B1 Downregulation by NLIPMT Inhibits

In the study by Yongkang An ef al., Over expression of IncRNA NLIPMT
62 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Setia et al.

Inhibits Colorectal Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion by Downregulating TGF-
B1, the study was designed to investigate the role of NLIPMT in colorectal cancer.
qRT-PCR and paired t-test were used to compare the levels of NLIPMT and
TGF-B1 expression in both types of CRC tissue [23]. By using linear regression,
the relationship between NLIPMT and TGF-f1 expression was studied, and the
effects of transfections on cell invasion or migration were investigated [93].
According to the study findings, NLIPMT was discovered to be downregulated,
whereas TGF-B1 was found to be increased in CRC. A negative association was
established between the expression of NLIPMT and TGF-B1 in the CRC tumor.
Overexpression of NLIPMT in CRC cells led to a decrease in TGF-f1 expression,
whereas silencing NLIPMT increased. According to the research on cell invasion
and migration, overexpression of NLIPMT reduced tumour cell invasion and
migration. NLIPMT's importance is reduced as a result of the overexpression of
TGF-B1, which may encourage CRC cell invasion and motility [93]. According to
the overall survival evaluation, patients in the NLIPMT-high groups of CRC
patients had better overall survival rates than NLIPMT-low group patients. It was
shown that the expression of the IncRNA, NLIPMT, was inversely linked with the
expression of TGF-B$1 in CRC. The downregulation of TGF-B1 by NLIPMT
overexpression reduced the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. An
additional benefit of NLIPMT expression as a biomarker for CRC patients was
that it predicted a good prognosis [93].

The Activation of KPNA3 by LncRNA DLEU1 Leads to the Advancement of
Colorectal Cancer

LncRNA KPNA3 activation leads to the advancement of colorectal cancer via
activation of LncRNA DLEU1; a study published in Molecular Cancer Journal
was conducted to investigate DLEU1's function in CRC [94]. QRT-PCR and
survival analysis were utilized to examine the relationship between CRC patient
prognosis and DLEU1 expression. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and
apoptosis, as well as carcinogenesis in nude mice, were used to determine the
presence of DLEU1 in CRC cells by lentivirus transfection [94, 95]. Testing for a
connection between DLEU1 and SMARCAI included the use of biotinylated
probe pull-down assays as well as RNA immunoprecipitation and fluorescence in
situ hybridization. When SMARCALI, an important NURF chromatin remodeling
complex member, is recruited by DLEU1, KPNA3 is activated. SMARCAI was
unable to be deposited at the KPNA3 promoter without the assistance of DLEU1.
There was an increase in the expression of DLEU1 and KPNA3 in human CRC
tissues, and the greater expression of DLEU1 or KPNA3 in patients, the worse
their prognosis. in vitro and in vivo, DLEU1 knockdown significantly reduced
CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while overexpressing KPNA3
temporarily reversed this effect. DLEU1 was found to be a key regulator in CRC
Colorectal Cancer Management Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 63

growth and development based on the authors’ research, which suggests that
DLEU1 might serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in the fight against
CRC.

CONCLUSION

In many nations, colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of mortality.
Colorectal cancer has been explained in-depth above. The function of IncRNAs in
tumors such as HOTAIR, H19, and MALAT 1 has been extensively discussed in
this chapter. Several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/B-catenin signaling
pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/insulin-like growth factor type
I (GF-IR) signaling pathway (KRAS and PI3k pathways), the TGF-B signaling
pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), were also discussed in this chapter. Many academics might benefit from
studying colorectal cancer as a result of the above-mentioned intriguing facts.

Abstract: Signaling pathways are important tools for regulating cellular life cycles
such as growth and replication. Any external influences may cause a disturbance in
signaling, causing an uncontrolled division of cells causing cancer. Many receptors
such as EGFR are active in signaling for cancer, which can be targeted to show potent
anticancer activity.

Keywords: Chromosomal instability, Microsatellite instability, Pathways,
Signalling.

INTRODUCTION

Signaling pathways are important in long-term cellular activities such as the
growth and development of cells. Many hormones are involved in such growth,
which regulates the various intracellular process. Any disturbances in these
pathways may cause disturbances in related processes, which may lead to
malignancies [1].

Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly found cancer in men and the second
most common cancer in women. It is caused by various genetic and epigenetic
alterations, which cause the generation of tumours in colorectal cancer. A four-
step pathway is suggested by scientists to explain the generation and progression
of colorectal carcinoma.

Three principle genetic abnormalities involved in colorectal carcinoma are:
CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY PATHWAY

This pathway is also called as adenoma-carcinoma progression pathway. Its
progression into the evolution of disease can be easily predicted and shows

specific histology. This pathway causes a proto-oncogene K-Ras and inactivates
three suppressor genes, namely loss of APC, loss of p53, and loss of
heterozygosity for the long arm of chromosome 18 [2].

Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene and wnt Signaling Pathway

APC gene-associated polyposis includes conditions such as familial adenomatous
polyposis, attenuated FAP, Gardner, as well as Turcot syndrome. FAP gene
causes the development of many pre-cancerous polyps around the age of 20. The
polyps may turn into a carcinoma decade later. Attenuated FAP shows fewer
polyps, and cancer develops later. Gardner syndrome is associated with soft tissue
tumours and osteoma, and Turcot syndrome cause nervous system tumours. APC
prevents entry of cell into S-phase from Gl- phase. The stem cells do not
differentiate and remain in the crypt, which allows them to survive. B-Catenin is
important in the Wnt signaling pathway and is degraded by the regular APC gene,
hence preventing the survival of cancer cells. In sporadic CRC with wild-type
APC gene, hypermethylation or point mutation in promoter region causes the
continuation of Wnt pathway. Normally, epithelial cells are shed within a week,
but such a mutation causes changes in phenotype and prevents shedding of cells,
leading to accumulation. This causes the formation of polyps [3].

TP-53 Mutation

TP-53 gene controls cell cycle and apoptosis and usually undergoes mutations in
CRC. P53 protein causes the cell cycle to stop and repairs DNA before
replication. If the DNA is not successfully repaired, it causes apoptosis of cells.
Inherited or germline mutations in tp53 cause a variety of syndromes such as Li-
Fraumeni syndrome, affecting various systems such as neurons and soft tissues

[4].
18q Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)

LOH is the loss of one or both the alleles of a gene. This LOH in 18q is frequently
seen in advanced colorectal cancer. The remaining allele is also mutated. This
missing part contains DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) gene coding for a
similar protein which prevents cell division even in the absence of a ligand. Cells
deep in crypts of the colon produce netrin-1 which then declines due to binding to
the DCC receptor. This decreasing netrin-1 concentration is essential for the
apoptosis of cells. When the DCC gene undergoes mutation, due to the absence of
the DCC receptor, the netrin-1 gradient does not reduce and apoptosis is arrested
causing continuous growth. Netrin-1 can be overexpressed which resists the
apoptosis by DCC [5].
Pathways in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 73
MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY PATHWAY

DNA nucleotides may be altered by environmental mutagens and errors. During
replication, the DNA polymerase enzyme ‘reads’ one strand to attach the
complementary base pairs. But the DNA polymerase enzyme is not always
accurate and errors can happen. As the enzyme reads in a 5’ to 3’ direction, it
keeps checking back for errors. If any mistake is found, the enzyme moves back
to the position, uses its ability to cleave that base. This function does not always
give accurate results. Hence, another system, the mismatch repair system checks
and corrects the pairing. Microsatellite instability is seen majorly in Lynch
syndrome characterized by an increased probability of cancers of linings such as
epithelium, endometrium, skin, brain.

Short tandem repeats (STRs)/microsatellites are small DNA segments containing
mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotides repeated hundreds of times. These are
frequently found in humans. The STRs found in humans are mostly dinucleotide
repeats. The microsatellites are alleles in genomes always present in two copies.
During replication, a stutter in enzyme may occur which is seen more in the area
of these microsatellites. MMR enzymes try to correct this phenomenon by
proofreading the microsatellites which preserve the genetic integrity of the human
genome. A defective MMR system will leave the genome with shorter or longer
microsatellites, which is called microsatellite instability. Inactivation of MMR
enzyme may happen due to sudden methylation of promoter gene or point
mutations at MMR family. Microsatellite high (MSI-H) is a condition of
instability in more than 30% of the markers. Patients with a minor loss of MMR
capacity may develop CRC later till the age of 40. I sporadic CRC, the majority of
defects are due to hypermethylation of promoters which prevent their expression.
As both the alleles are not lost, the MMR function is present but it is chaotic.

MSI tumours are generally seen at the proximal side of the colon and show a
cellular structure similar to mucinous carcinoma. It also shows WBC infiltration
similar to Crohn's disease [6, 7].

MMR system is effective in correcting the effect of some chemotherapeutic
agents, hence granting chemoresistance to malignant cells. MMR also recognizes
complexes made in DNA by drugs such as cisplatin, oxiplatin, and 5-fluorouracil
hence even after treatment, the prognosis is not altered.

EPIGENETIC INSTABILITY AND CPG METHYLATION

Many mechanisms are responsible for the regulation of DNA expression without a
change in nucleotide sequence. Mutations in the promoter region due to sudden
methylation may cause changes in epigenetic regulation. Many a time, patients
74 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Madrewar et al.

with EGFR overexpression may not respond to antibodies such as cetuximab. In
such cases, the genes coding for proteins present in downstream signaling is
responsible for this. When effector molecules of downstream signaling such as
KRAS, BRAF, PI3K, PTEN are unmutated, the best response can be obtained.

KRAS and BRAF are members of the MAPK pathway. This pathway regulates
cell proliferation, differentiation, and senescence. RAS pathway has HRAS,
NRAS, KRAS oncogenes out of which, KRAS shows the most frequent mutations
in CRC. KRAS is a small signal transducer protein in the EGFR family. The
mitogen-activated protein kinase is an important cell proliferation pathway from
the cell surface to the nucleus. When a ligand binds EGFR, the receptor dimerizes
and phosphorylates. RAS activates pathways through PI3K and RAF and affects
central distribution. PI3K upon activation prevents apoptosis and RAF stimulates
proliferation. Hence EGFR receptors inhibited are ineffective. KRAS mutations
are supposed to occur after APC mutations in adenoma-carcinoma separating
familial CRC. Patients with BRAF mutations have a poor prognosis but those are
limited to tumours without KRAS mutations. As BRAF is downstream than
activated KRAS, activating BRAF by V600E causes failure in an action of mAbs

[8].
PI3K/AKT PATHWAY, PTEN, AND TGFBR2

Wild KRAS is not enough to show sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in colorectal
cancer. Hence other molecules are responsible for the effect of monoclonal
antibodies. The phosphoinositide 3 kinase/AKT/mTOR is another pathway
controlled by EFGR.PI3Ks are lipid kinases that activate AKT after
phosphorylation. The phosphorylated AKT itself phosphorylates other proteins
such as mTOR. The oncogenic signaling may initiate by mutations in the gene
encoding catalytic region of PI3K. This mutation of PIK3CA is seen in somatic
mutations in 25% of colorectal cancers. TGFB is a group of multifunctional
proteins which control many cellular activities through binding to its receptors.
Three variants of receptor i.e., types-1,2 and 3 are seen expressed on a majority of
cells. In colorectal carcinoma, a type-2 receptor is majorly mutated. It generally
regulates the suppression of tumors, but when mutated may inhibit tumour
suppression. This receptor induces epithelial to mesenchymal transformation
(EMT) which may cause tumour progression and metastasis. When mutated, this
process is impaired and reduces the invasive and metastatic potential of tumours.
TGFBR2 is an important decisive factor in invasion and metastasis. It activates
downward factors such as PI3K/AKT and makes cells resistant to depletion of
growth factor, stress caused apoptosis and enhances cell motility [9].

SIGNALLING PATHWAYS IN COLORECTAL CANCER

Colorectal cancer can develop through a complex mechanism of multiple stages
which involves sequential mutations as cancer progresses. Signaling pathways
such as EGFR, Notch, PI3K, TGFB, Wnt are involved in regulating many growth
processes such as angiogenesis, differentiation. Genes that control the expression
of the signaling pathway may undergo mutations that change the expression and
function of their proteins in the long run which leads to cancer.

EGFR/MAPK Signaling Pathway

EFGR is a protein present across the membrane, which is a member of the ErbB
receptor family which includes tyrosine kinase receptors. This family has 4
members ErbB-1,2,3 and 4 which are closely related to each other. EGFR
pathway directs many processes such as growth, proliferation, survival of cells.
When this pathway is disrupted, abnormalities in growth, survival, and
proliferation are seen. MAPK is one of the members of the Ser/Thr kinase family.
Upon activation, these kinases cause activation of multiple kinases down the
hierarchy which causes phosphorylation of signaling components. Subfamilies of
MAPK are signal-regulated kinases (ERK MAPK, Ras/Raf), stress-activated
kinases (INK/SAPK), and MAPK14. Many growth factor receptors are present
upstream of the MAPK pathway. There are three types of Ras and many types of
Raf present in the pathway. When the ligand binds to a receptor, the receptor
undergoes dimerization. It causes autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on a
receptor. EGFR pathway has an adaptor made of growth factor receptor-bound
protein-2 (Grb-2) and son of sevenless (SOS). It binds to phosphorylated tyrosine
to activate the Ras-GTP complex. This activation starts a chain reaction with the
activation of RAF, MEK, EPK by phosphorylating them. This pathway regulates
the growth, proliferation, and survival of cells. If it is wrongly regulated, may lead
to the growth and progression of tumors (Fig. 1) [10].

Notch Signaling Pathway

The notch pathway is largely involved in cell-to-cell direct interaction. This
pathway regulates cell development, proliferation, and apoptosis. There are 5
ligands namely Jagged-1&2 and delta-like (DIl)-1,2,3 and 4. Four receptors
namely Notch- 1,2,3,4 are involved. This pathway has many genes downstream
such as p21, Hes-1, Deltex. Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins having
intracellular as well as extracellular domains. After ligands bind to receptors, the
signaling pathway activates by activation of y-secretases and breaking down notch
receptors. This cleavage results in the formation of an active form of a notch,
notch intracellular domain (NICD). This active domain moves to the nucleus and
binds to inactive CBF-1/supporter of hairless/LAGI transcription factor which
76 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Madrewar et al.

then forms a complex. Co-reprocessors bound to CSL will displace and new co-
activators such as p300, HAT, mastermind-like proteins will bind to it activating
it. This activation causes the expression of targeted genes such as Has. This
pathway controls intestinal development and homeostasis by regulating colonic
goblet cell differentiation and progenitor cells. In most cases, this pathway
promotes tumour growth but in some cases, may suppress tumour growth. This
pathway is more active in primary stages of CRC than in later stages [11].

PI3K Signaling Pathway

PI3K/Akt is a pathway that regulates activities such as cell growth, proliferation,
and migration. This pathway is activated by EGFR. PI3K is a dimeric molecule
having 2 different monomers, which come in 3 classes-1, 2 & 3. Three classes of
PI3K have different structures as well as functions. Class la is mostly seen in
CRC. It has 2 PI3K subunits, p85 regulatory and p110 catalytic subunit. Three
different genes namely PISKR1, PI3KR2, and PI3KR3 code for different forms of
regulatory units and different types of catalytic portions such as alpha, beta,
gamma and delta. A serine/threonine kinase protein, Akt mediates the effects of
PI3K on tumour growth thus acting as the effector. Phosphorylation of Akt causes
cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. This pathway has been used as a target to
develop many molecules. PI3K may be activated by stimulating tyrosine kinase
Pathways in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 7

receptors or activating Ras. When p85 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues
inside the cells, it does not inhibit p110 anymore. The active PI3K phosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate to form phosphatidylinositol-3,4,-
-triphosphate which activates Akt. Active Akt regulates downstream signaling
components such as mTOR which promotes growth and metastasis. Phosphatase
and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) causes dephosphorylation of
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate which inactivates this pathway (Fig. 2)
[12].

TGF-Bsignalling Pathway

This pathway controls many processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation,
migration, adhesion. This pathway prevents the proliferation of colon cells and
induces differentiation and apoptosis. Signaling is initiated by binding of ligands
to TGF-B type-2 receptors which can selectively bind to ligands restricting access
to others. When the growth factor binds to the type-2 TGF receptor, it
phosphorylates the type-1 receptor and stimulates its activity as a protein kinase.
Then the proteins present downstream in the signaling pathway such as receptor-
associated SMAD proteins (SMAD-2,3) are phosphorylated and these activated
proteins bind to SMAD-4. The effector molecules bind to this complex and enter
the nucleus. SMAD-6 prevents the formation of the above complex. SMAD-7
inhibits the interaction of TGFBR1 with R-SMAD. Many other proteins such as
DPR2, PP2A inhibit SMAD signaling. Similarly, many proteins such as SARA,
Endofin, Axin have a role in recruiting R-SMAD to bind with TGFBR2 and
enhance signaling in this pathway. The amount of SMAD proteins are controlled
to a steady-state by the ubiquitin-proteosome degradation pathway. The binding
78 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Madrewar et al.

of ligand to TGFRP activates many non-SMAD signaling pathways. These
pathways initiate many cascades due to activating kinases in the MAPK pathway,
Wnt pathway. Genes such as CDKNIA, CDKNIB are targets of the TGF-B
signaling pathway. These genes prevent uncontrolled growth. TGF-B inhibits the
proliferation of intestinal cells and induces cell death. TGF-f is highly expressed
in advanced stages of CRC (Fig. 3) [13].

Wnt Pathway

This family is made up of 19 secretory glycoproteins which contain the majority
of cystine in their composition. These proteins play important roles in processes
related to the development and biological activities such as fate specification,
migration, and asymmetric cell division. Wnt/B-catenin is important for tissue
maintenance and regeneration of hair, skin, and intestine. The Wnt pathway can
be divided into two categories a B-catenin dependent and B-catenin independent.
Pathway dependent on B-catenin assures a specific amount of stem cells in crypt
cells of colon thus plays an important role in physiology and cellular pathology.
Mutation of this signaling leads to malignancies in the colon and rectum. The
proper functioning of the Wnt pathway depends on the amount of catenin inside
Pathways in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 79

the cell. The catenin can be destroyed through phosphorylation and ubiquitylation.
This function is carried out by the destruction protein complex which contains
core proteins such as Axin, APC, casein kinase-1, and glycogen synthase kinase-
3. The secretion and accumulation of Wnt ligands cause interactions between
Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein which further leads
to activation of DVL protein. Activated DVL is located to the frizzed receptor,
separates f-catenin from the destruction complex, and takes to the nucleus. The
collected B-catenin in a nucleus is joined with the T-cell transcription factor or
lymphoid enhancer factor. It causes the expression of related genes responsible for
proliferation and transmission such as c-MYC, c-Jun, efc. If Wnt is absent, B-
catenin remains in the destruction complex and gets degraded. Excessive
activation of Wnt may cause oncogenesis in CRC and hence can be made as a
target for therapeutic molecules [14].

CONCLUSION

Signalling is an important step in cellular processes. Signaling activities control
long- and short-term processes related to cell division. During the development of
malignancy, these pathways are the first to get affected. Hence a deep
understanding of signaling pathways in colorectal cancer is essential for the
identification of therapeutic targets which will be used effectively for therapy of
colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Radiotherapy has become an integral part of the treatment of colorectal
cancer. Radiotherapy is used as adjuvant therapy in combination with chemotherapy or
surgery. In the article, various types of radiotherapy are explained and also the factors
involved in the selection of radiotherapy. There have been many clinical trials for
investigating the efficacy of various novel radiotherapies, which may show some
promising results. Radiotherapy can be adjuvant or neoadjuvant in the combination of
first-line therapy to increase the overall effectiveness of the treatment

Keywords: Colon, Radiotherapy, Rectum.
INTRODUCTION

As per the data, in 2018, about 1.7-1.9 billion people have been diagnosed with
colorectal cancer, and the deaths reported are close to 900000 [1]. Colorectal
cancer is considered one of the common forms of cancer worldwide, with some
reports suggesting it as the third most commonly occurring cancer. The most
affected countries include Australia, North America, European counties, and New
Zealand. Generally, for colorectal cancer, a combination therapy approach is
employed, which may include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy [2].
Radiotherapy is the mainstay of the treatment, whereas chemotherapy and surgery
can be used in combination. Radiotherapy, as the name suggests, is a radiation
treatment that generally uses higher doses of radiation to kill tumor cells and then
shrink them. Also, at lower doses, these radiations are used in X-rays as a
diagnostic tool to look inside the body [3]. At higher doses, these radiations kill
tumour cells or slow down the progression of a tumour by damaging the DNA.
So, when these tumour cells are damaged, the phenomenon is irreversible and
becomes non-repairable. When these damaged cells undergo apoptosis, they are
discarded by the body. Radiotherapy is not an immediate process and cell death

takes more time. Generally, days to weeks are needed after the DNA is damaged
to total cell death. The cell death process then continues as radiation therapy is
continued [4].

TYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY
Radiation therapy can be classified into two types which is:
External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and
Internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) [5]

The choice of radiation therapy is based on many of the factors, and some of the
factors are listed below:

¢ The type of cancer

* The relative size of the tumour

* Actual location of the tumour

* Medical history and overall health of a patient

¢ Contraindication and allergy scenario

¢ Other factors like age, gender, patient preference

The role of radiation pharmacotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancers has been
steadily changed over the last 3 decades. It emerged in the '80s with a prevalent
adjuvant function due to its ability to decrease pelvic recurrence after surgical
resection and increase survival rates in combination with 5-FU-based
chemotherapy [6]. In the early 1990s, radiotherapy was questioned, with the
induction of total mesorectal excision (TME) that significantly reduced
locoregional recurrence (LRR) [7]. Several randomized short-term studies (5 Gy
X 5 days) have shown the significance of preoperative radiation therapy plus
TME in reducing LRR in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer [8].
According to the American Cancer Society, treating colorectal cancer with
chemotherapy and radiotherapy simultaneously could make the radiation therapy
work better, and when both these treatment strategies are combined, it is called
chemoradiation [9].

Radiotherapy is not commonly used to treat colon cancer, but instead, it is used as
an adjuvant with other treatment therapies like before surgery along with
chemotherapy, after surgery to fully eradicate the tumour if any of the tumour is
left or the surgeon is not sure. If a person is not healthy enough for surgery,
radiotherapy can be used in combination with chemotherapy. But conversely,
radiation therapy is more commonly used in rectal cancers with or without
combination [10].
Radiotherapy in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 83

As stated earlier, there are two types of radiotherapies - EBRT and brachytherapy
and both these strategies could be used in treating colon and rectal cancer. The
type of radiation therapy most commonly used by people with colon or rectal
cancer is EBRT. From a computer-based machine outside the body, the radiation
is concentrated on cancer. It is a lot like having an x-ray, but this radiation is more
powerful. How often and how long a person receives radiation treatment depends
on the reason for the radiation and other variables being given. The treatment may
last from a few days to a few weeks [11]. New EBRT methods have been shown
to help doctors treat colorectal cancers that have spread to the lungs or liver more
effectively while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues,
such as three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), strength
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) [12]. All these methods are used only if the number of tumours is very
less and where surgery is not possible. Internal radiation therapy is not used
commonly as EBRT but it might be used to treat some rectal cancer. Although, it
is not used commonly more research is needed in this area. A radioactive source is
inserted inside your rectum next to or into the tumour in internal radiotherapy.
This helps the radiation to enter the rectum without going through the belly
(abdomen) skin and other tissues, so it is less likely to damage surrounding tissues
[13].

Neoadjuvant Radiation Therapy

At the beginning of the 1990s, many research studies and research pieces of
evidence were found which suggests the introduction of radiotherapy to
conventional surgical therapy could aid in an increase in the overall effectiveness
of the treatment [23]. One of the first important trials, the Swedish Rectal Cancer
Trial in which a significant advantage of neoadjuvant therapy (Radiation) was
determined as compared to surgery alone. Neoadjuvant therapy consists of a
combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Neoadjuvant therapy is
recommended by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) in cases of
advanced disease (> T3), lymph node involvement in imaging, and where the
adequacy of TME surgery is in doubt (circumferential resection margin).
Neoadjuvant therapy aims to reduce or weaken the tumor in preparation for
surgical resection [24]. Detailed pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 13
percent in a total group of patients of 27532 In the 2017 National Cancer
Database review, the decision to treat a patient with neoadjuvant therapy depends
on the presentation stage of the clinical tumor. It requires taking a comprehensive
medical history and clinical review, including digital rectal examination, and
radiological tests [25].

Probable Side Effects of Radiotherapy

If a patient is opting for radiotherapy, he should know the possible side effects of
the same. These side effects could be both short-term and long-term based on
different factors like age, pre-medical condition, duration of radiation, etc. So, the
possible side effects of radiotherapy are:

Skin irritation at the site of radiation, which can vary from skin redness to itchy
skin and peeling off an upper layer of skin.
Radiotherapy in Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 87

Irritation in the rectum can cause problems like diarrhea, bowel discomfort, blood
in stools.

Uninary bladder irritation, burning sensation while urination, presence of blood in
the urine.

Erectile dysfunction in men and other sexual discomforts in both men and women.

Some of these side effects generally disappear with time but maybe persist in very
rare instances [26].

CONCLUSION

Radiotherapy is a versatile therapy when it comes to treating cancers. It has been
the first-line therapy for ages and now it is also used along with other treatments
such as chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy to increase the efficacy of therapy to
destroy cancer. The treatment depends upon various factors such as the size,
position of the tumour. Like many others, this therapy also has some side effects
but as they go away with time, this is relatively safe.

Abstract: The incidence of colorectal cancer is very high, and emphasizing the
mortality rate of CRC, good screening and surveillance methods are essential for the
effective treatment of cancer. Early detection of the CRC is the key for its treatment. If
not detected early, it can cause serious symptoms like bleeding and difficulty in bowel
movement, which are considered serious symptoms. Different screening procedures are
available for the screening and detection of cancer, but the most commonly used
technique is colonoscopy, and another less common technique is flexible
sigmoidoscopy. People who have a screening colonoscopy have a cancer mortality rate
of 68 percent to 88 percent lower. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, although used in many
cases has certain limitations, and therefore, colonoscopy outplays it.

Keywords: Colonoscopy, Flexible sigmoidoscopy, Surveillance.
INTRODUCTION

The third most common non-skin cancer is colorectal cancer, affecting men and
women of all ethnic groups [1]. Every year, around 150,000 individuals are
diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and more than 50,000 die; the lifetime risk is 1
in 23 (4.4%) for men and 1 in 25 (4.1%) for women. When there is a personal or
family history of colorectal cancer, an increased risk of developing colorectal
cancer is present. One's risk of developing colorectal cancer is often increased by
a personal history of breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer. In its early phases,
colorectal cancer rarely causes symptoms [2]. Colon cancer typically begins as a
harmless or benign polyp. Polyps in the colon may be cancerous or non-
cancerous. Screening tests can detect polyps, which can then be removed,
preventing the development of colorectal cancer. In up to 90% of cases, early
cancers can be healed with surgery. Typically, when colorectal cancer causes
bleeding, changes in bowel behavior, or abdominal pain, it progress to a more
advanced stage, where less than 50% of patients are healed [3].

There are several screening options to consider for physicians and patients today,
including colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography (CTC), and
stool tests. Other non-general screening tests are also performed, which include
virtual colonoscopy and an enema x-ray test. After inserting air in the colon, a
virtual colonoscopy is done wia a CT scan. Air-filled colon images are
transformed into images that look like a colonoscopy. If anomalies are detected, a
colonoscopy is required. In patients that have an incomplete colonoscopy, it is
also helpful. An air-contrast barium enema is an x-ray procedure that involves
filling the colon with air and dye to expose the lining. It is often used only if it is
not possible to do a full colonoscopy [4].

In addition to expanded screening efforts, recent studies illustrate promising
reductions in CRC incidence and mortality. Since gastroenterologists are the
predominant and most efficient providers of colonoscopy in the United States,
colonoscopy is both the dominant existing form of screening and an important
element in the chain of events that leads to adenoma and cancer diagnosis and
resection when other screening modality results are positive. In recent years,
studies have shed light on the efficacy of CRC screening modalities and addressed
long-standing concerns while also igniting new debates [5].

COLONOSCOPY

Since the 1990s, colonoscopy has become the most popular CRC screening
procedure in the United States [6]. Numerous factors have led to this situation:
colonoscopy allows for clear visualization of the entire colon, polypectomy may
stop precancerous polyps from progressing to cancer, and clinicians may assess
reasonable surveillance intervals based on the results of the index test [7].
Colonoscopy has benefits over other screening modalities, such as shorter
intervals between tests and improved acceptability and tolerability of current
sedation techniques. Despite its widespread availability, it is not considered
inexpensive or readily accessible to the general public, making its use in mass
screening difficult [8]. Multiple case-control and prospective cohort studies have
shown that people who have a screening colonoscopy have a 68 percent to 88
percent lower cancer mortality rate than those who do not. A meta-analysis of
retrospective studies found that, despite a 68 percent reduction in overall
mortality, colonoscopy had little advantage in terms of cancer in the proximal
colon [9]. Another study observed a 29% reduction in overall CRC mortality, a
47% reduction in mortality from distal CRC, and no reduction in mortality from
proximal CRC. The above studies show that there is a significant reduction in the
overall mortality rate, but these do not apply to all the areas, and there remains a
lot of differences [10]. This distinction may be due to several factors influencing
the consistency of the act itself (for example, an incomplete colonoscopy, the
92 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Maru et al

gastroenterologist's level of training and experience, insufficient bowel
preparation, or technical difficulties with polyp removal in the proximal colon) or
variations in the biologic characteristics of proximal and distal colorectal cancers
[11]. To fully resolve these concerns, evidence from large controlled randomized
trials is still unavailable, although they are currently being performed [12].
Technical societies first supported screening colonoscopy in 1997, and Medicare
beneficiaries were authorized for it in 2001. Unlike the faecal occult blood test
(FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy, which are backed by RCTs, the use of
screening colonoscopy is focused on less-reliable indirect evidence from flexible
sigmoidoscopy tests, observational studies, and case-control studies [13]. The
United States Multi-Society Task Force on colorectal cancer recently revised its
2006 post polypectomy guidelines, taking into account the interim publication of
several related studies, the emergence of serrated lesions, and concerns about
decreased right-sided defense. Overall, the updated guideline supports the risk-
stratification model based on baseline colonoscopy results, which was developed
in 2006, and especially upholds the validity of the 10-year surveillance interval
recommended in average-risk individuals after a negative screening colonoscopy.
Surveillance guidelines for serrated lesions are also adopted, which are based ona
risk-stratification approach [14].

FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY

Periodic screening is the most promising approach for lowering the burden of
colorectal cancer. Because of the sensitivity of flexible sigmoidoscopy in
detecting early cancers and adenomas, it has been widely recommended at three to
five-year intervals. For family doctors, this examination is thought to be a cost-
effective intervention [15]. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is also used to screen for
colorectal cancer regularly. For people at average risk, most organizations
recommend screening every three to five years, starting at age 50. Endoscopic
maneuvering, colorectal anatomy, and pathologic recognition require extensive
training. After 10 to 25 precepted sessions, most doctors report feeling
comfortable performing the procedure without supervision [16]. The
sigmoidoscope is inserted through the anus and distal rectum, and the scope tip is
advanced into the sigmoid colon during the process. The long flexible
sigmoidoscope was inserted between 48 and 55 cm deep on average. The
sigmoidoscope is believed to be able to detect about 60% of all colorectal cancers
[17]. The three- to five-year screening interval recommendation is based in part
on estimates that an adenoma will progress to malignancy in seven to ten years.
For people of average risk, most organizations recommend starting
sigmoidoscopy screening at the age of 50 [18].

Other than its advantages and its effectiveness, flexible sigmoidoscopy also
Surveillance for Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 93

possesses some limitations like compliance of patients and physicians with it.
Many patients find flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy inconvenient, embarrassing,
and costly, and they may be hesitant to consent to the procedure. Only 10% to
30% of people who are repeatedly told to undergo sigmoidoscopy consent to the
procedure, according to studies. The importance of physician motivation in
promoting patient compliance with the procedure cannot be overstated [19].
Physicians report that the sigmoidoscope's use is limited due to the long procedure
time and extensive training required to master the technique. However, once a
physician has mastered endoscopic techniques, sigmoidoscopy procedures can be
performed regularly in under an hour. Additionally, there is no evidence that an
alternative method could outplay colonoscopy in the proximal colon, and
colonoscopists who perform high-quality procedures can provide substantial
protection from right-sided CRC.

CONCLUSIONS

In the end, we can conclude that as many as we have advanced therapeutic
strategies to treat the CRC, still its early detection plays a vital and key role in the
effectiveness of any neoadjuvant therapy. The early screening of colorectal cancer
increases the effectiveness, of surveillance program, and reduce the pain and
discomfort associated with CRC, and the patient would feel relieved.
Colonoscopy outplays flexible sigmoidoscopy in screening, and the statistics after
performing colonoscopy show its effectiveness. Mortality rate after performing
colonoscopy reduced to almost 70 percent. Therefore, early screening and proper
surveillance and monitoring could be useful in combating CRCs.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the common form of cancer occurring
worldwide, having a high occurrence rate and also high mortality (death) rate.
Chemotherapy and conventional approaches to treat CRCs are outdated and newer
strategies are required to combat colorectal cancer. Neoadjuvant therapies have also
shown some promise but have some major side effects, like building up intrinsic
resistance and systemic toxicity problems associated with such therapies. Cancer
nanomedicine, a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research field, is one of the new
strategies being developed to address these issues. The use of nanoparticles and
nanotechnology in cancer medicine has exploded in popularity over the last few
decades. This is due to nanoparticles’ suitable physical and chemical properties for in
vivo applications. Cancer nanomedicine has been extensively studied in preclinical and
clinical settings for targeted drug delivery and imaging. Nanomedicine, along with the
theranostic approach, has been proposed as a novel way to improve CRC diagnosis and
treatment.

Keywords: Nano-formulations, Nanoparticles, Prodrugs, Theranostics.
INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer is one of the most widely occurring cancers both in males and
females. The yearly deaths caused by colorectal cancer account for about 10%
worldwide. The overall 5-year survival rate in colorectal cancer is around 65%,
with longer period survival in the past decades only modestly increased [1]. Blood
in the stools, abdominal discomfort and pain, weight loss, and asthenia are the
major indications associated with it. The risk factors in colorectal cancer could be
environmental and genetic factors or a combination of both [2]. While genetic
factors account for a minority of cases, there is a clear correlation between a
positive history and an increased incidence of colorectal cancer. The so-called

adenoma-carcinoma sequence, a multi-stage mechanism, is the dominant
carcinogenic mechanism model for colorectal cancer [3]. Specific series of events
are there in the initiation and development of tumors. Three mechanisms tend to
be mainly based on CRC-related genetic alterations: chromosomal instability,
high microsatellite instability, or CpG island phenotype methylator [4].

The screening and diagnosis of the colorectal cancer population are made with
lots of diverse techniques. Faecal checks are employed to check blood in the stool
in people who have no symptoms [5]. Immunochemical faecal occult blood test
(FOBT) and guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) are primarily used in
screening programs for low-invasive studies [6]. More specificity is ensured by a
stool DNA test, which looks for unique DNA mutations. Blood-based screening
tests are useful for diagnosis, such as the identification of CEA antigen, the most
well-known CRC tumor marker [7]. The FDA has recently approved the use of
some novel techniques, such as CellSearchTM, to detect circulating tumour cells;
however, these techniques are expensive and routinely not easy to implement [8].
Colonoscopy is reserved for symptomatic patients or is used only as a second-line
procedure for routine screening of fecal test-positive patients. However, this
technique is invasive, has some patient compliance concerns, and has some risks,
like using anesthesia and possible cell or organ damage [9]. Alternative methods,
such as barium enemas for X-ray rectal outlining or more complete techniques,
including virtual colonoscopy and computed tomographic colonography, are
available if this method is not feasible, but they involve colon cleaning before the
examination and may detect non-neoplastic anomalies [10]. The introduction of
nanomedicines is important for the effective treatment of any cancer. Not only in
a therapeutic way, but nanomedicines are also used alternatively in a very
potential way as a diagnostic tool. When these diagnostics nanomaterials are
combined with therapeutics, they offer a very less toxic theranostic pathway [11].

NANOFLATFORMS FOR DRUG DELIVERY AND THERANOSTICS

Various tumour tissues are generally being identified as the cancer of the breast,
colon, rectum, prostate, brain, efc., but these all tissues are permeable to
nanomedicines and nanoparticles [12]. Nanoparticle and nano-molecule drug
delivery mechanisms can be divided into active and passive targeting. Active
targeting strongly depends on the interaction between the target cell receptors and
nanoparticles, while passive targeting relies on a variety of factors, such as longer
biological half-life, long-circulating period at tumour locations, and the flow rate
of nanoparticles to the disabled lymphatic system [13]. The EPR effects play a
vital role and pose a serious issue for any nanomedicine or nanoformulation,
which rapidly increases the uptake of these nanomedicines from the systemic
circulation by macrophages, and therefore, the nanoparticles are cleared at a very
Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 97

rapid rate from the body [14]. Targeted nanoparticles are currently one of the key
methods for CRC therapy in preclinical development as a drug delivery
mechanism based on monoclonal antibodies. There are different approaches for
theranostics, and some are explained below [15].

NANOLIPOSOMAL BASED THERANOSTIC NANOPARTICLES

In 1961 Bangham ef al. introduced the first therapeutic nano-platform used in
medicine. This nano-platform was built on liposomes, which are the
nanovesicular carriers and also the first clinical drug delivery system approved by
the FDA for clinical use [16]. One of the widely used nanoparticles for the
delivery of small peptides, nucleic acids, and proteins in nano-platform drug
delivery is liposome-based nanoparticles. At the cellular level, nanoliposomes are
known as one of the most powerful drug delivery mechanisms. This is primarily
due to their size, ability to incorporate different substances, and characteristics of
slow-release and targeting, which often contribute to lesser side effects [17].
Liposomes are now widely used as therapeutic nanocarriers, and they are also
used in diagnostic tooling. The use of liposomes for molecular diagnosis is now a
widely studied topic; the use of liposomes can be used for the diagnosis of various
life-threatening diseases, like cancer, and various nondegenerative diseases, like
Alzheimer’s, etc. The liposomes’ work involves the covalent binding of liposomes
with peptides, antigens, and antibodies. While the formulation of such specialized
liposomes that respond to the external stimuli are also in research progress and are
now formulated, showing dormant results in neuro-imaging and diagnostic
research [18].

Generally, this liposomal system can be classified into 3 main types:

1. Stealth Liposomes — These are large vesicular carriers and can be unlayered or
multi-layered vesicles with some modified structure like added Polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and or gangliosides to bypass the RES system by avoiding blood
plasma opsonin protein which directly binds to the liposomal surface thereby
inhibiting their activity.

2. Active liposomes — These liposomes are used for targeting specific moieties
like receptors, proteins, peptides, hormones, antibodies, etc.

3. Sensitive liposomes — These are specialized types of liposomes with unique
properties and be further subdivided as pH-sensitive, thermo (temperature)
sensitive, and magnetic liposomes [19].

An example of an FDA-approved nanoliposome for colorectal chemotherapy is
doxorubicin (Doxil®)-liposome Doxil is around 100 nm, and although it has much
less gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity, other side effects such as redness and
98 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Dawre et al

skin peeling are caused. Another recent nanoliposomal drug approved by the FDA
is Margibo*. Marqibo is approximately 100 nm and is an anticancer drug
dependent on the cell cycle [20].

Prodrug Approach

The design of nanomedicines in cancer therapeutics has been improved in recent
years by adding ligands that actively target overexpressed tumour receptors.
However, some barriers to achieving the ultimate objective of precision medicine,
including cost-effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, and disease-driven formulations,
still need to be overcome. This is where the diagnosis and treatment of a small
molecule-based mixture will play an important role. DDS, along with a drug
activation trigger moiety, connected to the chemotherapy drug, is normally
decorated with unique cancer-targeting units. Several stimuli-responsive modes
have been reported for drug activation, including pH, elevated activity of the
enzyme, redox status, light, and temperature [21]. In multiple cancer subtypes,
including liver, lung, and ovarian cancers, the lysosomal enzyme, B-galactosidase
(B-gal), is considered to be upregulated. A variety of attempts have been made to
imagine the upregulated B-gal real-time behavior in different models of preclinical
cancer. B-gal activity has also been used to enable several formulations of cancer
drug delivery and theranostic agents [22].

In this context, we established a small molecule-based theranostic method, Gal-
Dox, which through receptor-mediated endocytosis is preferentially taken up by
colon cancer cells. The active drug Dox (doxorubicin) is released with a
fluorescence turn-on response after cancer-specific activation, enabling both drug
localization and site of action to be controlled [23]. The therapeutic efficacy of
Gal-Dox, both in vivo and ex vivo, was also controlled, demonstrating the ability
of Gal-Dox as a highly specific colorectal cancer theranostics.

SUPER MAGNETIC IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES (SPIONS)

SPIONs are nanoparticles that have been the focus of nanomedicine research
since 1980 and have grown to include SPIONS specifically for nanomedicine and
nuclear medicine applications with a biocompatible polymer coating and core
surface modification. Exhibiting magnetization only in an applied magnetic field
and the ability to load drugs and medical radioisotopes are the main features of
SPIONs because of the hyperactivity of their surface [24]. SPION specifically
uses the external magnetic field to draw the nanoparticles at the active site or site
of action. While there is a range of studies using iron oxide NP ferumoxytol as an
MRI contrast agent currently undergoing clinical trials, the vast majority of
SPION formulations are in preclinical growth. It has recently been shown that
iron oxide NPs, as well as other NP formulations, create gaps between endothelial
cells of tens of microns in size (i.e., cells that form the interior walls of blood
vessels). Nanoparticle-induced endothelial leakiness is known as the mechanism
by which NPs cause such openings (NanoEL). There are important benefits of
administering SPION medications, including longer half-lives of circulation,
better pharmacokinetics, the ability to bring a large range of drugs, reduction of
side effects, and directing the medication to a particular place in the body [25].

For targeted photothermal therapy for the destruction of CRC, doped gold-
SPIONs have been created. To allow active targeting of the A33 antigen, which is
overexpressed in CRC cells, the produced gold-SPIONs were also functionalized
with a single-chain antibody. The findings showed that the internalization of gold-
SPIONSs for cells expressing the A33 antigen was five times faster than for cells
not expressing the antigen. In addition, this study found that 53 percent of A33-
expressing cells died after 6 minutes of laser radiation exposure (with an 800 nm
laser at 5.1 W-cm-2), while only 5 percent of A33 non-expressing cells died. Such
findings showed excellent selectivity for targeting and destroying the tumour of
the colon and rectum [26].

MRI is an extremely valuable medical method that offers precise spatial
resolution and comparison of soft tissue without using ionizing radiation or
potentially dangerous radiotracers. A strong external magnetic field is applied to a
100 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Dawre et al

sample of interest in the MRI, resulting in the magnetic moments of the protons
inside the sample being aligned. In such a system, when SPIONs are present, their
magnetic moments combine with the magnetic moments of neighboring protons,
causing spin dephasing and shortening the proton relaxation times in the vicinity.
The targeting of solid tumours in SPIONs by leveraging tumour biomarkers is
improved to improve the efficacy of SPIONs as MRI contrast agents for cancer
monitoring. To target a prostate biomarker, SPIONs recently produced to provide
contrast in T2-weighted MRI were conjugated with a deimmunized mouse
monoclonal antibody (muJ591). Much attention has been paid to optimizing
SPION formulations for their use to improve MRI contrast; SPION parameters
such as surface coating, shape, and composition are all important factors in
determining SPIONs' magnetic and biological behavior. SPIONs labeled with
peptides or antibodies serve as an active carrier for attacking the organ or tissue of
interest. Passive SPIONs, however, primarily depend on the form of polymer and
particle size to achieve aggregation at the target site. Hydrophilic SPIONs with
dextran and PEG surfaces are capable of preventing RES and resisting
opsonization (immune cell destruction), resulting in an increase in their biological
half-life (circulation time) and the possibility of attacking a particular cell. These
passive SPIONs can remain in normal nodal tissue and decrease the intensity of
the MRI signal, thereby improving contrast with any node metastatic lesions [27].

CONCLUSION

Nanomedicines are one of the versatile and excellent strategies for cancer therapy
as they serve as both a therapeutic and diagnostic approach, and the tumour
located can be diagnosed and treated simultaneously. Nanomedicines or
nanoflatforms, therefore, reduce the cost of the treatment and also reduce the
overall side effects of the chemotherapies and other related adjuvant therapies. It
is a rapidly evolving approach to treat CRCs, giving an edge over other strategies.
Different types of treatment approaches, like the prodrug approach, SPIONs, are
employed for the same. As it is currently evolving, various research studies are
ongoing on nanomedicines. We can say that nanoplatforms for treating colorectal
cancer (CRC) are an effective and better approach; concerning this, good results
are expected soon.

Abstract: Management of colorectal cancer is a very important part of treatment as
improper procedures may cause certain complications. Many decisions regarding the
treatment depend on the condition of the tumour and the patient, and also the focus is
on the treatment to be perform without complications. Management is done by first
preparing the patient with different procedures, like stomal therapy, bowel preparation,
or nutritional intervention. Then, the tumour is further evaluated, and accordingly, the
treatment option is selected. Possible treatment options could be electrocoagulation,
touch radiotherapy, local excision with or without neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy; they
all are local treatment methods for rectal cancer and endoscopic treatment. The results
may vary with the selection of the procedure and the prognosis.

Keywords: Colorectal cancer, Electrocoagulation, Endoscopic treatment, Local
excision, Stomal therapy, Tumour evaluation.

MANAGEMENT OF COLORECTAL CANCER

Kilian G M Brown et al., reported that in high-income countries, the occurrence
and mortality rates are higher for colorectal cancer [1]. Primary care physician
plays a very vital role in coordinating when the multimodal management
strategies are considered for colorectal cancer [2].

For primary confirmation, the endoscopic biopsy is further correlated with
histology. Also, at the clinical-stage, identification is important. Primary care
physicians can provide some prognosis and management guide. Computed
tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest is suggested in the UK
and Australia to have Australia to have better understanding of the disease spread
and condition. [3]. The stages are based on the magnitude of regional tumour
incursion (T Stage), engagement of lymph nodes (N stage), and distant metastases
(M Stage). The past diagnosis reports or imaging can be investigated for under-

standing the metastases with further analysis of patients’ blood for electrolytes,
blood component count, and renal functioning. For post-treatment analysis, the
disease surveillance is carried out with baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)

[4].

A specialist investigation by an oncologist or surgeon would be necessary. The
investigation is carried out with an MRI of the liver because detection of IV
contrast medium with a CT scan is not possible in some patients. Initiation
investigation with a CT scan or MRI is the choice of the patient who has rectal
cancer. The use of MRI provides accurate staging investigation [5].

HOW CAN YOU PREPARE PATIENTS FOR SURGERY?

In primary care, many aspects related to preoperative assessment are taken care
of. A preoperative optimization process is most often coordinated by colorectal
cancer preadmission or preoperative examination clinics. However, this varies by
healthcare environment [6].

Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)

This consists of the standard care within preoperative management for patients
undergoing colorectal operations. Variations can be seen in different institutions
in the protocols of ERAS. Early mobilization, anesthetic practice, enteral
nourishing, improving preoperative dietary position, education, counseling, and
postoperative analgesics are all examples of postoperative management. With
these protocols, the patients' stay can be shorten and complications can be reduced

7].
Stomal Therapy

Some patients may or may not require a temporary or permanent stoma after
colorectal surgery. Due to some complications that get created due to the stoma
like retraction, dermal abrasion, and parastomal herniation. The stoma formation
is affected by factors like the stage, size, and location of the tumour; treatment;
patient condition, and emergency surgery need. The low or mid rectal tumour may
need a short-term ileostomy. This therapy is optional and can be picked up if
desired by the patient. However, the stomal therapist needs to examine and also
select an appropriate location for stoma [8].

Bowel Preparation

For administration of oral laxative, a solution is being utilized and a clear fluid
diet is given preoperatively for at least 24 hours. For colonic resections, this is not
much favored by the surgeons. In several studies, it has been indicated that post-
Management of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 105

operative infections can be treated with mechanical bowel preparation and
antibiotics. Though there is some ambiguity, current UK guidelines warn against
frequently adopting mechanical bowel preparation before colorectal cancer
resections, so they do note that it can be beneficial in patients undergoing rectal
cancer restorative resection [9].

Nutritional Interventions

Malnutrition is common among cancer patients in terms of chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and surgery, as well as the metabolic consequences of cancer.
Colorectal cancer patients are at a higher risk of malnutrition than most cancer
patients. Patients with rectal cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation
have the highest rates. Though nutritional evaluation and support are
systematically given before colorectal surgery, there is a deficiency of details on
its potency. Preoperative carbohydrate loading is often considered in patients
experiencing colorectal cancer surgery. On the day of surgery, a smooth, oral
carbohydrate solution is delivered before midnight and again 2-3 hours before
surgery [10].

LOCAL RECTAL TREATMENT OF RECTAL CANCER (CLINICS IN
THE COLON A RECTAL)

Local treatment of rectal cancer remains a hot topic of discussion, with surgeons
worried that a narrow approach that avoids a colostomy may decrease the
possibility of cure. Despite improvements in surgical practice and the introduction
of a multimodality approach to the treatment of rectal cancer that has increased
sphincter-preservation rates, abdominal procedure are also associated with some
morbidity and mortality. Cardiopulmonary compromise and collapse, anastomotic
leakage and strictures, genital and urinary dysfunction, and clinical difficulties
with defecation and continence are also complications of radical operations [11].

The lower morbidity associated with local therapy, along with the maintenance of
normal bowel function after local excision, makes it a more appealing choice,
helping to keep it on the rectal cancer care algorithm as a feasible option in the
management of select rectum cancers. Furthermore, as we gain a greater
understanding of the clinical behavior of the tumour and the prognostic
importance of histologic grading and tumour characteristics, the use of local
therapy in the treatment of rectal cancer will grow, ensuring its place as an
alternative to radical surgery [12].

Tumor Evaluation

A systematic assessment of the patient is critical in the design of an effective
106 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

recovery strategy. A complete report should be obtained following a detailed
medical evaluation and examination of signs, bowel function, continence, and
investigation of comorbidities. Inguinal lymphadenopathy, gastrointestinal
observations, and sphincter consistency and structure should all be closely
studied. The involvement of regional lymph node metastasis, as well as the scale,
location, versatility, configuration, the circumference of the bowel lumen
involved, and distance from the anorectal ring, are important in developing an
effective treatment strategy [13].

The combination of clinical observations with radiographic and laboratory
assessment assists in more reliably assessing the depth of penetration and the
occurrence or absence of distant illness. Preoperative tumour size, node status,
and metastasis designation (TNM) staging of rectal cancer remain major
problems. While we have become more accurate in evaluating the T-stage and
testing for a distant disease before surgery, the existence or absence of regional
lymph node involvement remains poorly described. The CT scan is also used to
screen for distant illnesses [14].

The predictive utility of EUS is still being debated. However, it remains the best
available preoperative imaging system for staging rectum cancers. The T-stage is
a good indicator of lymph node metastasis. T1 cancers are commonly thought to
have a 0% to 12% chance of nodal involvement. T2 cancers have a 12 to 28
percent chance of lymph node metastasis, while T3 cancers have a 36 to 67
percent chance. The association between lymph node activity and the tumor’s
gross morphologic and histologic features is currently being examined [15].

Electrocoagulation (fulguration/ablation), touch radiotherapy, and local excision
with or without neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy are all local treatment methods for
rectal cancer and endoscopic treatment.

Electrocoagulation

The procedure requires a general anaesthetic and the use of a specialized 40-mm
operating proctoscope. The cautery tip is used to cauterise the entire surface of the
tumour as well as 1 cm surrounding it. The burned tumour is cut with forceps, and
the tumour bed is cauterized repeatedly until no detectable tumour remains.
Patients are typically discharged from the hospital within 24 to 72 hours of
surgery, with operative times ranging from 60 to 90 minutes. Electrocoagulation
and endoscopic laser treatment are appealing palliative therapies. However, its use
for curative purposes is also debatable. Advantages provide the ability to obtain
more proximal and deeper margins than local excision. However, no specimen
was collected for histologic staging and margin assessment, rendering evaluation
of its effectiveness as a potentially curative treatment impossible [16].
Management of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 107
Contract Radiotherapy

The treatment calls for the use of a specialized 29-mm proctoscope, which allows
an X-ray tube to travel through it and make direct contact with the tumour.
Tumors must be fully accessible by proctoscope and no greater than 3 x 5 cm in
dimension. Radiation was administered in fractions of 2000 to 4000 cGy toa 3 cm
diameter region every | to 4 weeks with a combined dosage of up to 15,000 cGy.
It is well accepted, even by elderly patients, and is normally performed as an
outpatient treatment. Touch radiotherapy has an advantage over indirect beam
radiation in that a high dose of radiation can be administered directly to the
tumour, reducing radiation damage to healthy tissue [17].

Local Excision

The benefit of local excision over other local treatments is that a preserved
specimen is collected for further pathologic examination. Disadvantages include
limited care of the nodal basin and suboptimal access and simulation. The surgery
is normally done under general anaesthesia after proper bowel planning for a
colon resection, while spinal and local anaesthesia have been published. The
patient is correctly placed, with the tumour at six o'clock. Various retractors were
used, with the use of lighted retractors improving visualization [18].

Stay sutures are placed 2 cm lateral to the tumour to aid in dissection. Another
method is to sew a suture close to the tumour, which would then be used to close
the defect. Electrocautery is used to do a full-thickness excision with 1-cm
margins across the tumour. The defect can be closed mainly or left exposed after
irrigation with a tumoricidal agent. After that, the specimen should be labelled
with the left, nght, cephalad, and caudal margins. Patients are typically discharged
home on the first postoperative day and are kept on a soft diet with a stool
softener prescribed if required [19].

Although cancer eradication is the primary target of any oncologic resection, local
excision is preferable to other local therapies in that a complete and preserved
specimen is collected for pathologic examination to ensure complete excision of
the primary tumour. Furthermore, while maintaining gastrointestinal continuity as
well as bowel, bladder, and reproductive activity, local excision is associated with
minimal morbidity and mortality [20]. Local excision is also widely used as an
alternative to radical resection for people who are unable to perform extensive
abdominal surgery. Its role in the care of stable patients, however, is uncertain.
Patients can be more reliably staged preoperatively with the continuing
development of imaging instruments (EUS, CT, magnetic resonance imaging
[MRI]), to properly select out tumours appropriate for local excision. The early
reports of local recurrence after local excision were encouraging [12].
108 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.
ENDOSCOPIC TREATMENT

To obtain good outcomes, endoscopic removal of early colorectal cancer can
necessitate specialized techniques and professional colonoscopists. There are
various solutions available solutions available currently [21].

Snare Polypectomy

Snare polypectomy is most widely used with pedunculated and sessile lesions
varying in size from 0.5 to 2.0 cm. The most frequent side effects of this treatment
include gastrointestinal bleeding, colonic perforation, and local peritonitis. When
an invasive lesion is suspected, scheduled polypectomy should be prevented.
Pedunculated tumours, in which the stalk and separate edges can be distinctly
incised with a snare, are an exception [22].

Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)

EMR incorporates traditional snare polypectomy concepts with the inclusion of
submucosal fluid injection. A cap attached to the tip of the colonoscope can help
stabilize the position in challenging places such as the ileocecal valve, the
anorectal junction, or a proximal spot on a fold. A sclerotherapy needle is often
used to inject a solvent into the submucosa to lift the lesion for easier removal and
to provide a buffer to shield the deeper layers of the bowel wall from mechanical
or electrocautery injury [23]. Because of its low cost and ease of use, normal
saline is the most widely used solution worldwide. The submucosal cushion, on
the other hand, is comparatively short-lived, and the mucosal elevation is more
diffuse. Since saline has a limited half-life, endoscopists have produced some
alternate agents to prolong the length of lifting, as well as chromoscopic agents to
enhance visualization of the submucosa. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose,
glycerol, starch volume expanders, and hypertonic saline are all common agents
used to prolong lifting length. To prevent bleeding during the treatment,
epinephrine may also be injected [24].

A diluted dye, such as inert indigo carmine or methylene blue, may be used to
delineate the depth of the submucosal cushion and ensure that the resection is in
the right place . Inability to lift the base of a lesion after submucosal solution
injection can mean cancer invasion deep into the submucosa. As a result, EMR
can only be attempted if complete resection of neoplastic lesions is expected.
Unfortunately, extracting multiple biopsy specimens, especially using
electrocautery using a partial snare, will result in non lifting of the lesion and
should therefore be avoided [25]. EMR technological performance rates have
been reported to be between 90% and 100%, with complication rates ranging from
0% to 9%.Bleeding is the most frequent intraprocedural complication, occurring
Management of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 109

in around 10% of all cases. To control acute hemorrhage, epinephrine injection or
coagulating forceps may be used. APC or snare tip loose coagulation should be
used to treat oozing. In about 1% to 2% of cases, EMR is complicated by colonic
perforation.Endoscopic clip closure should be attempted; but, if this is not
practicable or if peritonitis is present, the patient should be admitted to surgery
[26].

Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection

The standard ESD treatment starts with chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine
spraying for improved or magnified observation using narrow-band imaging to
establish tumour boundaries. Colorectal neoplasms usually have clear margins, so
labelling around the tumour is not expected in most cases. If marking is needed,
marking dots should be located 5 to 10 mm lateral to the lesion's margin. To
further balance the spot, a cap with a drainage hole at the midnight position can be
used at the tip of the endoscope, and carbon dioxide for insufflation is strongly
recommended since it is consumed quickly, creating less luminal distention and
patient pain [27]. A submucosal injection is typically given in the region that
needs to be incised to create a fluid cushion, which improves the procedure's
protection. Following the injection, a slight mucosal incision is created and the
lesion is dissected from the deep layers of the bowel wall using electrocautery
knives. A small needle knife is used to make a mucosal incision in front of the
tumour. The needle part should be used for the incision, with the tip of the sheath
resting on the mucosal surface and not being forced into the submucosal layer
[28]. For mucosal incisions, the electrosurgical unit's endocast mode is widely
used. It is important to maintain a submucosal dissection plane across the
submucosal layer following repeated submucosal injections to prevent damage to
the muscularis propria. Where dense arteries are detected, a prophylactic
hemostatic maneuver using coagulation forceps and soft coagulation should be
performed. A smooth dissection with less bleeding can be assured by keeping the
required depth of dissection at the right level at the layer with fewer arteries and
fibrous tissue [29].

WHAT IS THE SURGICAL OPTION FOR COLORECTAL CANCER?

The decision to treat depends on the prognosis or the stage of the disease.
Prognostic factors need to be considered when the survival of the patient needs to
be identified. Before the surgery, the team discusses with the patient the possible
complications that may occur after or during the surgery [30].

Open Surgery

In the situation of malignant colon and rectum tumours, the part of the bowel
110 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

covering the tumour and its supplying vascular pedicle is excised, leaving local
margins free of malignancy. Regional lymphadenectomy is performed by radical
resection of the mesentery, which includes supplying vascular pedicle and
lymphatic drainage. Depending on the anatomical location of tumour various
resections are performed [31].

Laparoscopic Surgery

Laparoscopic colectomy, though with a longer operating span, is now well known
as a reasonable option to open surgery for colon cancer. In an earlier meta-
analysis, laparoscopic resection succeeded in modest gains in short-term results,
including a decline in perioperative death, loss of blood, wound-related
complications, and length of hospitalization, as well as a faster recovery of
spontaneous bowel function. Major concerns about the oncological and longevity
effects of laparoscopic resection continued until long-term data from major
multicentre randomized controlled trials became available. The role of
laparoscopic rectal resection is still being debated, both in terms of oncological
protection and functional outcomes such as continence and sexual function. In
terms of active full excision, two recent multicentre randomised controlled trials
failed to indicate that laparoscopic rectal resection was not inferior to open
surgery [32].

WHAT ARE POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS?

Immediate

Anastomotic leakage is a major risk of colorectal surgery that generates
significant morbidity and mortality. Tumor factors (massive, progressive, or
metastatic tumours requiring low rectal anastomosis), patient factors (preoperative
radiotherapy, smoking, vascular disease, pulmonary disease, asthma, malnutrition,
corticosteroids), and operative factors are all risk factors (technical failure,
emergency surgery, blood loss, operative time, inotropes). Inflammation of the
operative site, bleeding, venous thromboembolism, and unintended harm to
adjacent anatomical tissues are all acute dangers of major abdominal surgery and
hospitalisation [33].

Long Term

Long-term risks of colorectal surgery include incontinence and sexual
dysfunction. Primary care doctors and other healthcare providers may play a vital
part in long-term medical counselling and support. More than 80% of patients
who have sphincter retaining resection (i.e., without a permanent colostomy) may
have a degree of postoperative bowel dysfunction, also known as anterior
Management of Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 111

resection syndrome. Increased incidence, incontinence, or obstructed defecation
can be signed. Neoadjuvant treatment and anatomically minimal tumours are both
risk factors [34].

Patients should be told about the risk of postoperative bowel complications before
surgery. Urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are also significant issues in
patients undergoing multimodal rectal cancer therapy. Both have received less
research attention than bowel-related quality of life, but dyspareunia in women
and erectile dysfunction in men should be addressed before surgery. Sperm
banking before care could be an alternative. It is now available via the NHS in
some circumstances in the United Kingdom [35].

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN
COLORECTAL CANCER TREATMENT?

Adjuvant chemotherapy can support patients with resected stage II colorectal
cancer and some patients with high-risk stage II colorectal cancer, according to
the UK and Australian guidelines. Its goal is to treat unresected micrometastases,
which can lead to chronic disease. A recurrence affects between 15% and 50% of
patients with stage III illness. Fluorouracil-containing adjuvant chemotherapy has
been shown to decrease the relative risk of recurrence by 40%, with a statistically
meaningful survival advantage. This advantage is increased by combining
oxaliplatin and fluorouracil, which is the mainstay of adjuvant chemotherapy in
these patients. In patients with stage III disease, the absolute advantages vary
from a 10% to a 20% increase in survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy is usually
administered for six months. Newer medications and formulations are being
researched to shorten the length of chemotherapy. Since patients with stage I
colorectal cancer have a reduced chance of recurrence, the effects of adjuvant
chemotherapy are modest. Patients that have poor tumour separation,
lymphovascular invasion, less than 12 lymph nodes retrieved on resection, locally
advanced disease (T4), and bowel obstruction or perforation are qualified for care.
In reality, adjuvant chemotherapy decisions are taken on a case-by-case basis by a
multidisciplinary team, taking into account the patient's age, fitness, and
proximity to oncology facilities (which vary between healthcare systems) as well
as consultation with the patient regarding their medical preferences. The side
effects and risks of complex chemotherapy regimens must be shared with patients
at their oncologist visit. Chemotherapy also causes fatigue, lack of appetite,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bone marrow suppression, and peripheral neuropathy
[36].

CONCLUSION

The various preoperative procedures helped prepare the patients better for the
112 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

treatment of cancer. Tumour evaluation helped in the identification of the
condition and also how the treatment needed to proceed. The identification would
play a vital role in getting the best results from the management procedures. The
different treatment options would be selected depending on various factors like
the condition of tumour, the patient's wish, the prognosis of the tumour, and the
specialist who is handling the case. Various treatment options include
electrocoagulation (fulguration/ablation), touch radiotherapy, local excision with
or without neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, are local treatment methods for rectal
cancer and endoscopic treatment. There are advantages and disadvantages of
management procedures, but they need to be chosen depending on the factors.
