Abstract: Colorectal carcinoma is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy.
As it is hidden in many cases and as the onset is undetectable, it may prove to be fatal.
Hence, early screening colorectal cancer is a way to prevent this disease. Screening
depends upon various factors, such as familial history, history of the disease, or any
condition which could lead to colorectal carcinoma. Various tests, such as fecal occult
blood test, sigmoidoscopy, and CT scan, are available for screening. The screening
method to be used depends upon various contributing factors. Screening can be
invasive or can be non-invasive using many markers.

Keywords: Detection, Early diagnosis, Novel tests, Screening tests.
INTRODUCTION

Colorectal carcinoma, the fourth most common internal cancer, is a common
internal malignancy. In Canada, around 24,800 new cases of colorectal carcinoma
were reported in 2021, and 9600 deaths of affected individuals. The disease
occurrence per year has increased in men and women since 1988. In terms of the
benefits of detecting colorectal carcinoma, population-based screening is gaining
popularity around the world. In January 2007, Colon Cancer Check was
introduced by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and Cancer
Care Ontario in a collaborative approach. The probability of having this cancer at
birth is 7.4% in men and 6.5% in women, while the probability of dying with this
cancer is 3.7% in men and 3.3% in women [1].

DETECTION OF EARLY COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

The survival of the patient depends on the stage of CRC at which they have been
diagnosed. In England, The National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme
showed a reduction of colorectal cancer in the early stage detected group than the
control group. This helped in understanding that the early-stage detection of the
disease could help in the prevention of most colorectal carcinoma [2]. Several
colorectal carcinomas do not show any symptoms until a stage where a certain
obstruction might result in altered regular bowel habits and may cause abdominal
discomfort. Blood in the stool can be seen at the early stage of colon and rectal
carcinoma, which is frequent and unpredictable. The disease starts with a crypt
and with the progression of gene mutations, further giving rise to small polyp,
which then sooner or later metastasizes. This natural process provides a window
of time for detection as early as possible and then removing the polyps. With an
early-stage detection of carcinoma, the deaths and disease can be reduced
drastically [3].

EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF COLORECTAL CARCINOMA

The need for colorectal cancer screening is urgent and widespread and serious, as
it was the second leading cause of death in Canada, affecting both men and
women equally. Early detection of carcinoma was possible with some screening
tests with high accuracy. The early-stage removal of adenomatous polyps helped
in the reduction of incidences and also reduced mortality due to colorectal
carcinoma. The advantages of early screening compensate for its problems.

Significant efforts are needed from patients, medical practitioners, and
government. As in Canada, the low percentage of detection was contrasted with
the indicative presentation [4].

WHAT IS SCREENING?

Screening is the identification of potential patients who might likely have
colorectal carcinoma or adenomatous polyps without showing any indications or
signs. Reducing the mortality rate is the main reason for screening [5].

WHO SHOULD BE SCREENED?

New cases could be seen without any affecting factor for colorectal carcinoma.
Occurrence is about 75%. People without any factors are at very low risk
compared to the ones who have any family history of colorectal carcinoma, which
is about 15 -20%. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer accounts for 4-7% of the
total cases, and familial adenomatous polyposis accounting for the remaining 1%.
10 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

The remaining 1% consists of a variety of unusual disease situations like Crohn's
colitis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, chronic ulcerative colitis, and familial polyposis.
Various factors that could be kept in mind are low fiber and high saturated fat
diet, older age, inactive routine, and extreme consumption of alcohol [6].

Depending on the risk of colorectal cancer the screening is different. With some
questions asked, the risk can be defined well for colorectal cancer:

a. Have you ever suffered an adenomatous polyp or colorectal cancer?

b. Is there any history or current medical condition of diseases such as
inflammatory bowel disease that could lead to or influence colorectal cancer?

c. Is there a family history of adenomatous polyps or colorectal carcinoma? If
yes, then how many members of the family are related to the patient, and at
what age was the first polyp detected [7]?

SCREENING PEOPLE AT AN AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL
CARCINOMA

Screening need to be offered to average-risked men and women. Use of fecal
occult blood test, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy in adults of age 50 - 75 year is
suggested by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Due to a lack of evidence,
positive or negative effects of fecal DNA testing and computed tomography
colonography as screening modalities for colorectal cancer are not known. Due to
the presence of options, patients may choose screening techniques depending on
their preferences [8].

Fecal Occult Blood Test

This involves tests based on dietary restriction. Guaiac-based test that has dietary
restrictions or the immunochemical test, which has no dietary restriction. Within
three consecutive stools, two would be taken for examination without rehydration.
Colonoscopy is suggested for patients who might get the test positive. The FOBT
screening test has helped reduce the mortality rate in Minnesota trials by 21%. A
review of three clinical studies found that a restricted diet cannot reduce the
positivity rate in older people and that a very strict diet may reduce compliance
and reduce sensitivity to the guaiac-based test [9]. A major drawback of this test is
that it cannot detect some carcinoma and polyps. False test results could have
been seen for colorectal neoplasia, and due to this, the patient might need to go
through cost, risk, and discomfort of colonoscopy without much advantage [10].

Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

Sigmoidoscopy is suggested to go for screening every 5 years. It was stated that it
helped decrease the death rate of patients with colorectal carcinoma. The only risk
related to sigmoidoscopy and colon carcinoma was reduced, but for others, it did
not change. The incidences of proximal advanced adenomas without distal
adenomas was in the range of 2-5%. Screening with sigmoidoscopy followed by a
colonoscopy resulted in a reduction of 80% of colorectal carcinoma incidence
which was seen in one controlled trial [11].

Combination of FOBT and Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

When both are considered together, FOBT is done every year and every 5 years
sigmoidoscopy is performed. When both tests are considered, the FOBT is
performed first because it provides the preliminary investigation needed to
consider colonoscopy and then sigmoidoscopy is needed. Due to some
advantages, they both together are more effective like:

¢ FOBT may be less sensitive to distal colon lesions.

« FOBT and sigmoidoscopy screening are associated with reducing mortality
which was shown in a case-control study.

«FOBT and sigmoidoscopy together assisted in a 43% reducing deaths of
colorectal carcinoma in a nonrandomized controlled trial [12].

Colonoscopy

With colonoscopy, it is possible to reduce the incidence of colorectal carcinoma
when people have adenomatous polyps.Detection, amputation of polyps, and
colon biopsy for carcinoma with colonoscopy. As it involves entire colon
visualization it poses more risk, cost, and hassle to patients than any other
screening test. In an average-risk person, the screening is done at a 10-year
interval if only the prior test was negative. Also, the interval depends on the
sensitivity to colonoscopy and the advancement of the adenomatous polyp
towards carcinoma (which takes nearly 10 years). Some do suggest doing the test
in 5 years as some believe the time interval to be 5-8 years [13].

It was observed in a huge potential study regarding colonoscopy that nearly 50%
of patients that had advanced proximal neoplasms did not have distal colonic
neoplasm. Also, a study of the distal colon showed that about 65% of a group of
avetage-risk patients with carcinoma proximal to splenic flexure did not have
neoplasm distal to the splenic flexure. The appropriateness of indicator for a
colonoscopy may be determined through distal adenomas A group of 153 patients
without distal adenomas showed that about 54% had non- advanced proximal
12 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

adenomas and 33% had advanced adenomas. As a result, the absence of distal
adenomas should not be overlooked when scheduling a colonoscopy. A
randomized clinical controlled trial compared sigmoidoscopy with colonoscopy
with no screening and validated a significant decrease in colorectal carcinoma
occurrence in screened patients [14].

Double-Contrast barium enema (DCBE) is recommended after every 5 years. This
test has not been evaluated for a reduction in mortality or deaths in people of
average risk of colorectal cancer. This is considerably less sensitive than
colonoscopy for large polyps and carcinoma. Also, the procedure does not allow
amputation of polyps or tissue removal of carcinoma. Results with abnormal
barium enema need to go further with colonoscopy. This is considered an
alternative option as it provides complete colon examination, and is broadly
available too [15].

SCREENING PEOPLE AT INCREASED RISK FOR COLORECTAL
CARCINOMA

Family history of Colorectal carcinoma or Adenomatous Polyp includes
considerable data in people who have relatives (like parents, siblings, or children)
who have been detected with adenomatous polyps or colorectal carcinoma below
60 years of age. With a family history, the risk could be higher at 40 years of age
compared with a 50-year person. Screening should be started at least 10 years
before the earliest diagnosis found in a family [16].

Genetic Syndromes

Genetic counseling and testing are needed in patients with genetic syndromes.
Annual screening can be replaced by pre-symptomatic genetic testing to identify
individuals who are deprived of the gene and at risk. Those who have the gene
can go for annual screening for colon and rectal at least with a sigmoidoscopy.
Screening recommendations for HNPCC have varied. However, the advice for
sequence carriers has been endoscopy starting at age 20-25 years or a minimum
of five years before the earliest age at which colon malignant neoplastic disease
was diagnosed in an exceedingly specific kindred. The procedure ought to be
perennial each alternative year till the patient is thirty years old and annually
thereafter. The frequency of colonoscopic examination is increased by the finding
that HNPCC adenomas have repair-deficient cells with speedily and unrelentingly
accumulating mutations that support the clinical construct of “aggressive
adenomas” and accelerate the adenoma-carcinoma sequence [17].

NEW SCREENING TESTS

CT Colonography

A novel technique for colonoscopy is virtual colonoscopy or computed
tomography colonoscopy (CTC). Helical CT scan used in CTC and similar bowel
preparation needed as colonoscopy. Potential advantages for CTC are: (a) without
prior bowel preparation, the study can be done; (b) greater patient acceptability
could be achieved; and (c) the potential for screening for vital unwellness outside
the colon.

At present, CTC seems reasonable for patients with incomplete colonoscopy or
poor candidates for colonoscopy, although DCBE is also a good choice and costs
less. It also makes sense to do CTC (with intravenous contrast) in patients with
obstructive colon carcinoma [18].

Faecal Occult Blood Test

As carcinoma is based on mutation from normal to adenomas tissue, so these
mutations could be detected through stool analysis and therefore, Fecal DNA
testing is preferred. In 4000 asymptomatic people who had 21 mutations were
analyzed with screening colonoscopy, fecal DNA testing, and FOBT in patients
that have advanced carcinoma. Specificity and sensitivity observed were 82% and
87.5% of fecal DNA testing. As it is non-invasive, no colonic preparation and
capability of detecting neoplasia are found [19].

CONCLUSION

Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is important to ensure; early diagnosis is
important to ensure timely treatment of the disease. There are many methods
available for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, which should be selected based on
careful understanding of the underlying factors.
