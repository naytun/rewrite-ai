Abstract: A diagnosis is an important tool in the detection and combat of colorectal
cancer. Early-diagnosed cancer can be cured easily. There are many invasive as well as
non-invasive methods of diagnosis for colorectal cancer. Non-invasive methods usually
involve the use of various biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. Recently, enzymes from
lysosomes that take part in metastases have been discovered to have importance as a
diagnostic tool.

Keywords: Biomarkers, Diagnosis, Invasive, Lysosomal exoglycosides, Non-
invasive.

INTRODUCTION

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer. It is observed
that almost 4.3% of men and 4.0% of women in this world is suspectable to have
colorectal cancer in upcoming times. The outcome for people with colorectal
cancer is improving, but the overall five-year survival rates are still lower than
60%. There is a need for greater accuracy in diagnosis and staging. The
astonishing fact about colorectal cancer (CRC) is that among all the colorectal
cases, almost half the percentage is reported from developing countries. This
might be due to the limited resources for diagnosis and poor health infrastructure,
which ultimately leads to increased mortality rates due to CRC. Though, in
western countries, the good health infrastructure and early screening and
diagnosis improvise CRC treatment. As far as India is concerned, the age standard
rate (ASR) for CRC cases is low, approximately 7.2 per 100,000 male population
and 5.1 per 100,000 female population; yet India is a nation of 1.38 billion-plus
people, with a staggering number of CRC-affected populations, and with a low
five-year survival rate (less than 40%) [1].

Certain epigenetic disorders and genetic alterations can hinder CRC treatment.
The basic reason for CRC is the methylation and covalent modification of
histones. To make treatment of CRC more effective, early diagnosis of neoplasms
and identification of pre-cancerous stageis essential [2]. It hasbeen observed from
histological data that CRC can cause perforation within the intestine; therefore,
chances of obstructive ileus formation are pragmatic.Most of the patients, who
witnessed colonic polyps at early stages, ultimately develops CRC. It is of utmost
importance to remove adenomatous polyps to prevent the conversion of CRC
from colonic polyps (Fig. (1) [3].

Invasive Examination

To identify the CRC, the most common practice is rectal examination. During the
examination, almost around 70% rectal and 30% CRCs can be diagnosed. But it is
most important to have the necessary experience as a physician who handles the
case. Endoscopy is the most prominent tool or method to instantly recognize
CRC.

To perform the histological examination and to perfectly identify and localize
tumors associated with CRC, it is important to perform sigmoidoscopy and
colonoscopy, which are a type of endoscopy [4]. With the help of recent
Cancer Diagnosis Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates 3

advancements in endoscopy, it is possible to detect tumors with up to 92-97%
accuracy. If there is an advancement of CRC to lower parts of the colon, then
sigmoidoscopy can play a pivotal role in diagnosing the condition, whereas
colonoscopy helps to inspect the entire colon with the proper illustration of
sensitive information. During the diagnosis of CRC, the colonoscopy was found
to have many advantages, viz., it can increase the accuracy of detection with a
limited time frame. To perform the palliative procedure and CRC diagnosis
sigmoidoscopy would be a necessary tool. For those patients, who are at potential
risk if the surgical operation is performed, sigmoidoscopy can help to clean and
identify obstructions generated due to CRC. The biggest disadvantage of
sigmoidoscopy is its invasive operations, which can create certain discomfort to
the patients; as it may create preformation and bleeding in the intestine [5]. Lead
to circumvent such problems, recently developed virtual colonoscopy created a
buzz within the scientific community. By applying computer tomography, it is
possible to obtain 3D images of the large intestine. Most importantly, the non-
invasive virtual colonoscopy helps to decrease the risk of unnecessary bleeding
from the intestine [6]. Many imaging tests like nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), endorectal ultrasonography (USG) help to identify the actual conditions
of CRC when the patient has severe focal lesions. From the biomedical research,
it was found that, alternation of carbohydrate, fluor-18-fluorodeoxyglucose
positron could be the reason for CRC. The positron emission computed
tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) depicts a prognostic value with response to the
treatment. The 18F-FDG PET/CT tomography helps to identify the potential
chemotherapeutic challenges in patients, who are affected with CRC. From the
ongoing research, it was observed that 18F-FDG-PET/CT has a significant
amount of CT sensitivity; which allows researchers to identify cancer metastases
within the liver. Many pieces of research suggest that positron emission
tomography (FDG PET) was found to be the most potent tool to identify the
interpreted results from gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The treatment using
18F-FDG-PET/CT has shown positive responses within 10 days of the
initialization of treatment. This technique is more effective in patients after radio-
chemotherapy. As per the NICE guidelines 27, if the body persists lesion,
colonoscopy is recommended.

NON-INVASIVE DIAGNOSIS METHODS

Fecal Occult Blood Test

In this technique, the hemoglobin content was identified in human fecal. If traces
of hemoglobin are found, it indicates that the blood might be shedding from
polyps (1-2cm) or CRC. This test needs to be repeated several times to enhance
sensitivity up to 90%. In CRC diagnosis, the scientist is concerned about the
4 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

presence of hemoglobin, because it is the key component to identifying CRC by
an immunohistochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT) [7]. It is often observed,
colorectal adenocarcinomas show characteristic changes when the person has
CRC; therefore the alteration of sDNA is a common phenomenon in CRC.
However, limited applicability was seen in molecular diagnosis of CRC; hence,
genetic and epigenetic tests have limited application in CRC diagnosis. Certain
disadvantages of molecular diagnosis of CRC are the limited availability of
biomarkers and the overall cost of molecular diagnosis is too costly [8].

Non-enzymatic Tumor Markers

It was often observed from the research that the tumour markers are propagated
from tumour cells or the healthy cells when they start responding to tumours.
However, marketed spurious non-enzymatic tumour markers are a big concern in
CRC diagnosis. The best part about markers is, it helps to improve screening tests,
prognosis, and examining CRC diagnosis process. By the proper histological
images, the normal cells can be easily differentiated from benign tumour cells. In
different body fluids, the markers can be assayed [9]. In Table 1, the various
cancer antigens (CA), glycoproteins, and TAG-72, tissue polypeptide specific
antigen (TPS) are highlighted. The metastasis phase can easily be evaluated when
tumour markers’ expression is elevated. Tactlessly, available marketed markers
have insufficient sensitivity towards CRC cells with limited organic specificity.
Therefore, there is a prerequisite to have more sensitive biomarkers for CRC.
Gastrointestinal tumours can be identified using CEA markers (5 g/l). CEA is a
glycoprotein that is propagated from the large intestine. The elevated CEA levels
might be due to carcinogenesis. After the invasive operation, if CEA levels
increase in the blood; that might be the symptoms of tumour recurrence.
Noticeably, the elevation of CEA level in the blood occurs only when the patient
has the last stage of cancer. Elevated CEA levels before surgical operation
indicate adverse prognosis in a patient. In some cases, it was also observed that
the patient would have advanced metastases with elevated CEA, but the clinical
symptoms were obsolete; which helps to extend the survival time of a patient.
Recent research also suggests that, even though the intestinal tumor expands,
CRC levels are found missing in the blood. NNot only in CRC condition rather
during inflammatory bowel disease and pancreatitis, the CEA elevation was
reported. The presence of CEA is specific to CRC, but its sensitivity and accuracy
were questionable in CRC recognition [10]. Another biomarker is CA 19-9;
carbohydrate antigen, which was observed in the blood at an elevated
concentration when a patient suffered from pancreatic or gastric colorectal cancer.
The CA 19-9 can be a reliable marker in the diagnosis and monitoring of CRC.
Like CEA, CA 19-9 also has less sensitivity in cancer diagnosis [11]. Nowadays,
CA 19-9 and CEA are conjointly applied to evaluate tumor stage and viability.

For the diagnosis and monitoring of the chemotherapeutic effect of
gastrointestinal tumors, tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS) was estimated;
which evolved during the S and G2 phase of mitosis. The concentration of TPS in
serum was related to the neoplasm in cell proliferation. Hyperplasia can be
recorded when an increased level of TPS was recorded. The elevated
concentration of up to 60-70% can be seen in CRC patients. A study reveals that
75% of TPS levels were seen in patients who are suffering from colorectal cancer.
It was also noticed that an initial high level of TPS reduces the time of survival
rate for a colorectal cancer patient. Recent research findings also suggested that
the presence of TPS estimation is more important than CEA monitoring. The
elevated TPS level can also be seen in autoimmune disease and the most elevated
level of TPS can be seen in patients who are suffering from post-alcoholic
hepatitis. Another marker called TAG-72; tumor-associated glycoprotein, was
produced by endothelial cells and gastric epithelial and bile ducts. There are other
markers i.e., p-53, ras index, and thymidine phosphatase (TP), which have
significant applications in CRC prognosis [12].

Lysosomal Exoglycosidases as Potential CRC Markers

Recently many studies suggest that the various lysosomal exoglycosidases, i.e., B-
galactosidase and N-acetyl-B-D-hexosaminidase could be the best possible
markers for colorectal cancer. These lysosomal exoglycosidases are generated and
regulated by macrophages. These microphases, and mastocytes take part in
metastasis and the development of CRC. Other studies suggest that when CRC
advances in the patient body, an increased percentage of HEX, HEX A, HEX B,
GAL, and FUC was observed in the patient’s urine. Patients with CRC have also
6 Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Therapeutic Updates Bhattacharya et al.

been reported with elevated GAL; which could be more prominent in the serum
and urine of the patient. The biggest advantage of lysosomal exoglycosidases
study is that, it has low cost and repeatability chances are more. However,
lysosomal exoglycosidases show limited specificity [17].

CONCLUSION

The options to diagnose CRC are progressively increasing through proper
research and development. However, more research is needed to improve the
prognostic approach to treat single genes and tumor markers. Nevertheless,
routine clinical practice and invasive examination are still the best possible ways
to cure CRC. But the limitation is some patients don’t want to participate in
diagnosis and practicing surgical procedures. Moreover, patients should be aware
of the limitations of non-invasive tests, which are less effective than invasive
techniques and clinical diagnoses. For a patient who is at higher risk of CRC, it is
recommended not to rely on non-invasive tests or diagnosis. The best possible
way to enhance the diagnostic approach of CRC in a non-invasive technique was
to measure simultaneously two markers at a time. For therapeutic monitoring,
non-invasive techniques are needed to perform. It has advanced to a non-invasive
diagnostic test for CRC during therapeutic monitoring. It is also advisable to
identify CRC in the initial stage by examining different markers i.e., lysosomal
exoglycosidase, which reduces the risk of mortality associated with CRC. More
research needs to be warranted to enhance the endoscopic examination of
colorectal cancer.
