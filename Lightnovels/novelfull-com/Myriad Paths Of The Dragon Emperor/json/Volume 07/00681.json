At every rank, he had at least six spirit lamps lit. How large was his Spirit Fire?</p><p>...</p><p>Although Lu Ming lit up ten spirit lamps at each level, he was only a third-level Alchemist previously. He was still far from being a seventh-level Alchemist.</p><p>For example, a martial Grandmaster realm martial artist and a spirit embryo realm martial artist were worlds apart.</p><p>Therefore, the spiritual fire of the seven-colored Daoist was still causing Lu Ming’s spiritual fire to continue to grow rapidly.</p><p>Moreover, it contained fragments of the seven-colored Daoist’s experience. Lu Ming’s experience in alchemy and inscription formations was becoming more and more abundant.</p><p>eh? look, there’s another Palace up ahead!</p><p>Xie nianqing suddenly pointed to the front and said in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. Indeed, there was a mountain range in front of him. On one of the mountains, there was a Palace.</p><p>could it be that the seven-colored Daoist has more than one Palace? could it be that all his treasures are hidden in the palace in front? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Obviously, Xie nianqing had the same guess.</p><p>kill! Kill our way over and snatch all the treasures!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming turned into two streaks of rainbow light and flew in that direction.</p><p>But not long after, they stopped.</p><p>In front of them, there were two rays of light, one in front and one behind, speeding towards them.</p><p>In front of him was a golden sword light. In the sword light was a young man in his twenties. He was extremely handsome and exuded a powerful aura. Obviously, the young man was being chased by a light from behind.</p><p>The ray of light behind him was an old man.</p><p>“Spiritual practitioner han Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were shocked to see the old man behind them.</p><p>The person chasing after him was actually spiritual practitioner han Dao. But wasn’t he trapped in the big array in the square? He had actually escaped and even appeared here.</p><p>However, looking at the spiritual practitioner han Dao’s aura, he should have been severely injured and was far from his peak state. He was at most at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the treasure and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao shouted.</p><p>However, the young man had no intention of paying attention to them. He flew forward at top speed and flew past Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao was in hot pursuit. He glanced at Lu Ming and was stunned for a moment before he shouted,”Little bastard, it’s you! You deserve to die!”</p><p>With an angry roar, the spirit Warrior han Dao stopped chasing the young man and pounced on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. His eyes were filled with deep hatred.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how much he hated Lu Ming. He had directly abandoned the young man.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave and the infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing reached out his hand, and a huge sky demon power field covered the spirit Warrior.</p><p>However, the spiritual practitioner han Dao was indeed powerful. Although he was injured, the vital essence in his body was still extremely powerful. His vital essence burst forth and broke through the sky demon force field, charging toward Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>cut! Xie nianqing shouted again. Destructive cutting power burst out of the sky demon force field. The terrifying cutting power seemed to be able to cut open the space.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao shouted angrily. His body was covered in white ice, which looked like a suit of Ice Armor. He continued to rush forward.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the infinite Dragon Spear and rushed into the sky demon power field. The Spear’s gleam was aimed at the cold saber spiritual practitioner’s throat.</p><p>Lu Ming was not restricted in the slightest in the demonic power field, just like he was outside.</p><p>The sky demon force field was completely under Xie nianqing’s control.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao slashed his saber and blocked Lu Ming’s long spear. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s realm was too high. Even though he was injured, his combat strength was still terrifying.</p><p>“Little bastard, die! You will all die today!”</p><p>The killing intent in the eyes of the spiritual practitioner han Dao was so strong that it couldn’t be dispersed.</p><p>Three days ago, he and the red-haired old monster had been trapped in the formation for half a day and had almost died. Fortunately, there were other people who had arrived there and helped them to destroy the foundation of the formation.</p><p>Although he had managed to escape, he had been severely injured and had yet to fully recover.</p><p>One could imagine how much he hated Lu Ming and Lin Feng.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline and his second bloodline were activated at the same time, and Lu Ming’s combat strength increased greatly.</p><p>ninth level King. Both bloodlines are ninth level King!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao cried out in disbelief as he was almost scared to death.</p><p>When one’s bloodline was activated, it was inevitable that one’s bloodline level would be exposed. It was simply unbelievable that both of his bloodlines were king class ninth level.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. After his Blood Meridian exploded, his combat strength increased and he charged towards the spiritual practitioner with the frost saber.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao wanted to kill him, so why wouldn’t he want to kill him too? Otherwise, it wouldn’t feel good to be targeted by such a despicable old monster. Who knew if the other party would do something behind his back?</p><p>die! This brat is too terrifying! He must die!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao was even more determined to kill Lu Ming. His blade glowed as he fought with Lu Ming.</p><p>However, under the influence of the demonic power field, he was greatly affected. It would not be easy for him to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll smash it!”</p><p>Dandan shrank back into the turtle shell and suddenly smashed towards the spirit Warrior han Dao’s face.</p><p>However, sea of soul realm Warriors who had comprehended the second level intent could already control the nature’s attributes to form armor that covered their entire body. They rushed over, but they only hit the ice Armor on the face of the spirit Warrior han Dao.</p><p>“Nest, I haven’t recovered enough. Otherwise, I would have smashed through that old man’s ice layer!”</p><p>Dandan flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder and mumbled, looking for another chance to launch a sneak attack.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a golden sword light flew over.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man from before had actually returned.</p><p>Before he had even arrived, a golden sword Qi, extremely sharp, cut through the void and slashed towards the spirit Warrior han Dao.</p><p>“Brat, let’s die together!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao shouted angrily and waved his blade to block the sword light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man appeared in the air and swept his gaze across the room. His eyes finally landed on Lu Ming.”Shura?”</p><p>“The King of Hell?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He could tell from this person’s aura that he was the King of Hell.</p><p>The other party had obviously recognized him.</p><p>“How about we join forces? Kill this old man!”</p><p>The King of Hell spoke.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a smile on his face.</p><p>Hell King’s combat strength was extremely terrifying. With him, they could fight against the injured spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>“Golden light vibration sword!”</p><p>King Yama was straightforward and attacked directly. The dazzling golden sword Qi emitted an extremely sharp intent as if it could cut through everything.</p><p>Hell King had comprehended the metal will and had reached level two. The metal will was known for its sharpness.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field naturally did not hinder the King of Hell.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming appeared and thrust his long spear forward. A three-colored true dragon flew out and pounced at the spirit Warrior han Dao.</p><p>Facing the attacks of the three people, spiritual practitioner han Dao slashed out blade lights towards the three people.</p><p>With a loud boom, the two sides were evenly matched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
