Both of them were destroyed.</p><p>...</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon let out a long roar, and its Jade-like blue Dragon body pounced toward the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao’s momentum was like a rainbow, and the snow-white blade energy around him danced, as if it had frozen the space.</p><p>An icy blade light slashed towards the flood Dragon.</p><p>The flood dragon’s claw collided with the saber radiance, and the boundless energy spread in all directions, tearing the surrounding sea beasts and human warriors into pieces.</p><p>“Let’s go up and fight!”</p><p>The cold-saber elder flew into the sky, and so did the flood Dragon.</p><p>At their level, a battle below would have too great an impact. It would affect other humans and demonic beasts.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The battle between the ice spiritual being and the flood Dragon continued all the way to the sky.</p><p>However, the battle in the sea became even more intense. The sea beasts had joined the giant deep sea snakes, and their combat strength had increased greatly, completely suppressing the humans.</p><p>The most fatal thing was that the deep sea Giant snake Race had two great demons at the spirit sea realm. They were too powerful, and they were like no man. With a casual twist of their huge bodies, a large number of humans were killed.</p><p>The two giant deep-sea snakes charged at the humans without restraint. No one could stop them.</p><p>Screams and wails of pain resounded through the air.</p><p>retreat, retreat quickly! We can’t stop two spiritual ocean tier great demons at all! Retreat quickly!</p><p>Someone shouted. He didn’t dare to stop them and retreated frantically.</p><p>As a result, the human’s defensive formation was in complete chaos. The sea beasts kept charging into the area where the giant deep-sea snake was.</p><p>A large number of martial artists were killed.</p><p>This time, there were far too many sea beasts. They were far too powerful, far more than they had ever been.</p><p>we can’t keep golden sand island anymore. We can only retreat to the other islands!</p><p>no, we’ve been operating on golden sand island for hundreds of years. We can’t just leave like this. Hold on and wait for help!</p><p>There were all sorts of cries, but the morale was constantly falling.</p><p>“A sea of soul realm demon?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the giant deep-sea snake. Then, he took a step in the air, turned into a stream of light, and sped in the direction of the giant deep-sea snake.</p><p>In the other direction, a golden sword light was also heading toward the deep sea Giant snake.</p><p>The speed of the two rays of light was extremely fast, and in a dozen breaths, they had already neared the two spiritual ocean tier deep sea Giant snakes.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming approached and thrust his spear forward. A three-colored true dragon roared and danced in the air, pouncing at one of the giant deep-sea snakes.</p><p>“An ant dares to attack me? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The deep sea Giant snake snorted and spat out a black water column toward the tri-colored true dragon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent tremor, the water column and the three-colored true dragon disappeared together, but the giant deep-sea snake’s forward figure was also blocked.</p><p>Not far away, a golden sword light also blocked another giant deep-sea snake.</p><p>It was the King of Hell.</p><p>Lu Ming and the King of Hell were each facing a huge deep-sea snake.</p><p>The two deep sea Giant snakes should be at the early stage of the first level of the sixth level, which was equivalent to the early stage of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Previously, at the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Li Xiaoyun, and Gu Huaxu had worked together to injure the old ancestor of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. The old ancestor was an existence at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>During the battle with the forefather of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the peak Lv 9 martial King realm. Now that he had broken through to the peak King realm, his combat strength had increased greatly. Since then, he had not fought with his full strength.</p><p>Now, this giant deep-sea snake was just the right one.</p><p>“Who is it? He blocked the deep sea Giant snake?”</p><p>it’s King Yama and Asura. Are they going to fight with a sea of soul realm beast? ”</p><p>it’s possible. Their combat strength is extremely terrifying. If they can stop the two giant snakes, we’ll have a chance.</p><p>a martial King fighting the spirit sea? is that possible? ”</p><p>I don’t care anymore. We can only take a risk. Let’s attack and stop the other sea beasts with all our strength!</p><p>stop! the surrounding human warriors roared and organized their forces to block the other sea beasts.</p><p>“Asura, let’s have a match and see who can kill this giant snake first!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the voice of the King of Hell rang out. It was very young, but it was filled with sharpness.</p><p>“Alright, let’s have a match!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was also soaring.</p><p>Previously, the two of them had some apprehensions and did not fight. But now, they could use another kind of confrontation to determine the winner.</p><p>However, when these words fell into the ears of the two deep-sea Giant snakes, they almost exploded with anger.</p><p>“Ant, you want to kill us? go to hell!”</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, the huge deep-sea snake roared angrily. It opened its mouth wide and was about to devour Lu Ming. Its tongue was like a sharp sword, shooting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. The three-colored Spear’s radiance revolved and transformed into a Spear’s radiance, stabbing at the giant snake.</p><p>At the same time, the King of Hell was also engaged in a fierce battle with the giant deep sea snake.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The tongue of the deep sea Giant snake was like a real sharp sword. When it collided with the long spear, it actually made a sound of gold and iron colliding.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, the snake’s tail swept across the void, causing a muffled explosion in the air as it whipped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and soared into the sky, dodging the snake tail’s attack. However, the snake tail was like a bone-attached awl. It missed its target and continued to attack Lu Ming from below.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded, and a terrifying power burst forth, each wave stronger than the last, bombarding the snake’s tail.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The snake’s tail trembled as if it was bearing an unimaginable force. It continued to shake, and finally, a part of it exploded with a bang, blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>“The spiritual ocean tier giant snake is injured!”</p><p>When the other human warriors nearby saw this, they were immediately excited as if they had seen hope. They roared and charged toward the sea beasts.</p><p>“Ant, you dare to hurt me? die, die!”</p><p>The huge deep-sea snake curled its body and the endless sea water turned into sea snakes that pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear disappeared. Lu Ming cast the exploding star fist. Rays of fist radiance pierced through the void and blasted downward.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had integrated three intents into the explosive star fist. It was faster and the explosive power was stronger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>It was as if there were countless meteors falling, constantly colliding with the sea snakes formed by the sea water.</p><p>With a loud boom, endless energy spread out. The Warriors and sea beasts nearby died on the spot once they were hit.</p><p>“Leave, stay far away!”</p><p>At the place where Lu Ming and the giant snake were fighting, the other Warriors and sea beasts had already left.</p><p>On the other side, the battle between King Yama and the giant deep-sea snake was similar. The sword Qi was everywhere, and the other Warriors and sea snakes were also far away.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The fist force became more and more violent and intense. In the end, one could barely see Lu Ming punching. One could only see streams of fist radiance pouring down.</p><p>Cool! It felt too good!</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was boiling and his fighting spirit seemed to be burning.</p><p>This was his true battle, a battle without the slightest hesitation, without the need to suppress his true Yuan.</p><p>He felt that he was able to use the exploding star fist more and more smoothly.</p><p>Suddenly, the fist ray trembled, and its power seemed to have increased by another level.</p><p>The fifth level was that Lu Ming had comprehended the exploding star fist to the fifth level during the great battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
