Otherwise, it’ll be more and more disadvantageous to the human race!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the entire venue.</p><p>He didn’t need to worry about Xie nianqing. As long as he was in the spiritual ocean tier, Xie nianqing would not be in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step and his figure disappeared. The next moment, he appeared beside a peak-tier King Tiger shark. He thrust his spear and killed the tiger shark. Then, he took another step and killed the next peak-tier King Tiger shark.</p><p>He didn’t attack the other tiger sharks, choosing to attack the peak-tier King-level ones.</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, two old men were being completely suppressed by a silver Tigershark.</p><p>These two old men were also two old monsters in the nearby Sea area. They had lived for hundreds of years and were extremely powerful. However, even when the two of them joined forces, they were not the opponent of this silver Tigershark. They could not even break the defense of the silver Tigershark.</p><p>The silver Tigershark was not afraid of death and kept attacking the two.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the old men was hit by the tail of the silver Tiger shark and was sent flying for thousands of meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>this kind of descendant is too strong. We’re not its match at all!</p><p>The other old man quickly retreated.</p><p>However, the silver Tigershark was in hot pursuit and could not escape at all.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that I’m going to die in the mouth of this beast today?”</p><p>The old man sighed. Although he tried his best to resist, he was still hit by the silver Tigershark and spat out a large mouthful of blood. His body was constantly sent flying.</p><p>“I’m going to die!”</p><p>The old man thought to himself.</p><p>However, at this moment, a black-robed figure wearing an Asura mask suddenly appeared beside the silver Tigershark. A terrifying long spear pierced through the head of the silver Tigershark.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the silver Tigershark was killed.</p><p>Then, the figure slapped the wound of the silver Tigershark and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>The old man was stunned.</p><p>“What a powerful attack!”</p><p>The old man who had been whipped away by the silver Tigershark’s tail flew over, his eyes full of amazement.</p><p>They couldn’t break the defense of the silver Tiger shark even if they tried their best, but this figure had killed it with one spear strike. This attack power was really terrifying.</p><p>this man should be the rising expert on the life battle platform. His name is Asura, and I heard he’s a young man.</p><p>The old man in the back spoke as if he had just woken up from a dream.</p><p>“Heroes really come from youngsters!”</p><p>The old man from before sighed.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll go and kill those ordinary peak-tier tiger shark Kings!</p><p>The old man behind said. The two of them then charged toward the two ordinary peak-tier tiger sharks.</p><p>The one who had killed the silver Tigershark was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>He naturally didn’t know what the two old men were thinking. At this time, his target was those peak-King level tiger sharks.</p><p>In just over ten minutes, he had already killed sixteen peak-tier King-level tiger sharks.</p><p>what a strong power of blood essence. It’s too strong!</p><p>The blood essence of sixteen peak-tier tiger shark Kings was too strong and incomparably rich.</p><p>The power of blood essence of demonic beasts was usually richer and stronger than that of humans.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to kill as he refined.</p><p>This time, he continued to use the power of the blood essence to improve his second bloodline.</p><p>When his second bloodline reached the eighth level of the king level, the mist on the stone stele seemed to have faded a little, and the words on the stele had become clearer.</p><p>There were three words on the stone tablet. The first word was ‘suppress’.</p><p>The third word was ‘tablet’. Only the second word was a little blurry and could not be seen clearly.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that as long as his second bloodline advanced to the ninth level of the king level, he would be able to see the second word clearly. At that time, he might have unexpected gains.</p><p>Lu Ming hunted peak-tier King demonic beasts while refining his blood essence.</p><p>On the other side, a figure wearing a Yama’s mask was shining with a golden light. The golden light was flashing, and every time it flashed, a peak King level blood shark would be killed.</p><p>He was killed in one strike.</p><p>Similarly, wherever Xie nianqing went, sea beasts were killed one after another, regardless of their level.</p><p>Lu Ming charged and killed for a while. He had already killed more than twenty tiger sharks, a peak King. At this moment, he had killed his way out of the tiger shark’s territory and into the sea lions ‘territory.</p><p>There were also descendants of the sea lions who were extremely powerful. However, they were still killed by Lu Ming with one shot.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had devoured more than thirty peak-tier King-level demonic beasts ‘blood essence.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>At this moment, the sea water churned and rushed towards the shore. In the sea, there were countless huge figures circling.</p><p>They were actually huge sea snakes. Each of them was dozens of meters long and their bodies were thicker than a water tank. They opened their mouths and swallowed a warrior.</p><p>With a twist of its body, a martial artist was bound to death.</p><p>deep sea Giant snake, it’s a deep sea Giant snake!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>what’s going on? another race has appeared. This is too abnormal. How can this be? ”</p><p>“Ah, watch out!”</p><p>Screams and shrieks of pain were heard everywhere.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>&Nbsp; the ocean churned, and everyone saw two giant snakes in the water. Their wriggling bodies were more than a hundred meters long, and their powerful auras were astonishing.</p><p>With a swing of its tail, a large number of martial artists were hit by the tail and directly exploded.</p><p>Even peak-tier King tiers were the same. They didn’t even have the power to retaliate.</p><p>Shapeshifting great demons. These two giant deep sea snakes were shapeshifted great demons.</p><p>With two transformed demons equivalent to the spiritual ocean tier taking action, the human side was showing a one-sided trend.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>In the air, the spiritual practitioner han Dao had not made a move. At this moment, he shouted and stepped forward, walking towards the two transformed demons.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A snow-white blade light flew out, and every blade light that flew past killed a giant deep-sea snake. When those blade lights flew into the sea, the sea water instantly solidified and turned into ice, freezing a large number of giant deep-sea snakes in the ice.</p><p>“Peak third level spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>One of the deep sea Giant snakes said in a serious tone.</p><p>“Since you know, die!”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao’s aura was magnificent. Two snow-white blade lights slashed towards the two giant snakes.</p><p>“Old man, I’m your opponent!”</p><p>The waves behind him churned, and an incomparably huge figure rushed out of the sea.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The roar shook the sky. It was the roar of a Dragon.</p><p>“Heavens, that’s a flood Dragon!”</p><p>Many people’s pupils suddenly widened as they cried out in disbelief.</p><p>The giant figure that appeared at the end was actually a blue flood Dragon. This flood Dragon had a long and slender body that was more than two hundred meters long. It had four claws under its belly and its aura was terrifying.</p><p>This was a real flood Dragon, a living flood Dragon with the blood of a real Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked in that direction in shock.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen a living flood Dragon. He had seen a dead flood Dragon refined into a demon corpse by the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>The blue water dragon opened its mouth and roared. Two water tornadoes were sent toward the cold saber spiritual practitioner’s Saber Light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
