They would most likely die.</p><p>No matter how powerful the lightning cauldron was, with Lu Ming’s current peak-tier King cultivation, he would definitely not be able to kill a fourth level spiritual ocean tier cultivator. He might not even be able to kill a third level spiritual ocean tier cultivator.</p><p>“It’s a pity, Jian feiliu!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly.</p><p>This was how the world of martial Dao worked. No matter how much of a genius you were, if you weren’t careful, you would fall.</p><p>In the long river of history, who knew how many geniuses had fallen. Those who could truly rise up and reach the peak were few and far between.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go. That group wants to monopolize it. Hehe, how is that possible? let’s go and give them a big gift!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You want to spread the news?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>that’s right. Since they want to monopolize it, we can only muddy the waters. Only by muddling the waters can we fish in troubled waters!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I want. It’s best if a stronger expert appears and exterminate them!” Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>“Let’s go to the wind Moon Island first. This Island is even bigger than the Golden sand island. We’ll spread the news there. I believe that it’ll quickly spread throughout the chaotic Astral Ocean.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the map and took a look. Then, the two of them rose into the air and flew in the direction of the wind Moon Island.</p><p>“Eh? There’s someone down there!”</p><p>After flying for a short while, Xie nianqing suddenly pointed to the sea.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw a figure floating on the surface of the sea. Golden light emerged from its body and the fish around it did not dare to approach.</p><p>“That looks like Jian feiliu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The figure on the surface of the sea did look like Jian feiliu.</p><p>The two of them landed on the surface of the sea. Lu Ming used his essential core and rolled them up.</p><p>He was slightly shocked when he saw that this person was really Jian feiliu.</p><p>Why was Jian feiliu here? Lu Ming had thought that Jian feiliu had been killed by that group of people.</p><p>“He’s still breathing. He’s not dead, but he’s been deeply poisoned!”</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the island and Save the People First!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. The two of them returned to the small island.</p><p>There was a golden light emitting from Jian feiliu’s body. It should be the doing of the golden sword Pagoda. However, it did not stop Lu Ming from saving the person.</p><p>He controlled the bloodline of the nine Dragons and devoured all the poison in Jian feiliu’s body.</p><p>This poison was very powerful. If it had been a few days later, Jian feiliu would have died.</p><p>As soon as the poison was removed, the vital essence in Jian Feilu’s body circulated automatically and began to heal.</p><p>After two hours, Jian feiliu opened his eyes.</p><p>“Brother Lu, it’s you!”</p><p>Jian feiliu was extremely surprised to see Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Brother Jian, you’re heavily injured. You should recuperate first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, wait a minute. Brother Lu, miss Xie, you must not go to the Martial Emperor’s treasure ground. The blood poison sect is setting up a trap there to seize all the Jade swords. The others are all dead!</p><p>Jian feiliu cried out anxiously.</p><p>“Brother Jian, it’s too late now. We’ve already been there.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What? Go … He’s been there? Then … You guys …”</p><p>Jian feiliu was a little stunned. He had been there but Lu Ming and the rest were fine?</p><p>“I did give my Jade sword to them, but we seized the opportunity and escaped.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You gave them the Jade sword? Alas, it’s a pity that the Martial Emperor’s treasure is going to fall into the hands of those despicable people.”</p><p>Jian feiliu sighed unwillingly.</p><p>“They want to keep the Martial Emperor’s treasure for themselves? It’s not that easy, they won’t be able to gather the last Jade sword.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>A Jade sword appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand.</p><p>Jian feiliu was stunned, then he was overjoyed, ” “Haha! Man proposes, God disposes. It turns out that brother Lu and miss Xie each have one. I wonder what the expressions of those people from the blood poison sect will be like when they find out. Oh right, brother Lu, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>“Of course we’re going to muddy the waters. The more muddy the better. Brother Jian, are you interested in joining us?” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Of course, of course we’ll go together!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said with excitement.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade sword in Xie nianqing’s hand glowed.</p><p>“Do you want to know their reaction? We’ll know soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He took the Jade sword from Xie nianqing’s hand and channeled his vital essence into it. Instantly, a rough voice was heard.”Your good friend, the eight of us are all here. Only one more is left. Friend, where are you?”</p><p>It was the voice of the burly man. Lu Ming and the other two did not make a sound.</p><p>that’s right, my friend. We’re only short of you. As long as you come, we can open the Martial Emperor’s treasure and take out the treasures inside. If we delay any longer, I’m afraid that there will be more problems.</p><p>It was the timid voice of a woman.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times.</p><p>Instantly, the other side became excited.</p><p>“Where are you, brother?” the burly man asked. Once you’re here, we can immediately start opening the Martial Emperor’s treasure.”</p><p>“Hehe, this friend is finally speaking. May I ask where you are? Are you in the chaotic Astral Ocean?”</p><p>The timid voice sounded again.</p><p>“Everyone, I hope you’re well!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke. Then, the Jade sword immediately fell silent. There was no sound at all.</p><p>After a while, a rough voice sounded, ” “It’s you?”</p><p>“That’s me. You guys are so forgetful.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You … You actually have two Jade swords? How is that possible?”</p><p>The rough voice was filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Brother, what do you want?”</p><p>A timid voice sounded.</p><p>“Your blood poison sect is very powerful. The few of us can’t compete with you. Therefore, I plan to pull all the brothers and sisters in the chaotic Astral Ocean to share the Martial Emperor’s treasure. Isn’t this a good idea?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You have to spread the news. No, you can’t do this. Damn it, you can’t do this!”</p><p>The rough voice roared.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, he heard a rough voice and heavy breathing. It was obvious that he was angry.</p><p>little brother, let’s talk this over. I promise you that as long as you come over, we won’t touch you. After we enter the Martial Emperor’s treasure, we’ll split the keys equally. How about it? ”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice rang out. It was the voice of the blood poison sect’s sect leader.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Little brother, what do you want then?” The blood poison sect’s sect master said.</p><p>“That’s easy, I want your heads!” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>little brother, let me give you a piece of advice. Don’t go too far. Otherwise, it won’t do you any good!</p><p>Seeing that the discussion was not going to work, the sect master of the xue du sect began to threaten.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
