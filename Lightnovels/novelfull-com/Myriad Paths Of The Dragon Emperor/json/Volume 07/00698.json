The heavenly Wolf tribe was located in the South.</p><p>The holy mountain was in the center of this land.</p><p>“We’ve come here for the Martial Emperor’s treasure. The entrance to the chaotic Astral Ocean must have been set up by someone. The ancient ancestor of this world suddenly descended several thousand years ago. Could that ancient ancestor be the one who set up that entrance?”</p><p>or perhaps, the ancient ancestor was a Martial Emperor? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>However, if he was really a Martial Emperor, why was he hiding in this place? And it had been sleeping for thousands of years without waking up?</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the Martial Emperor’s treasure was not as simple as it seemed.</p><p>According to the tall and thin man, all the tribes were trying to capture the extraterrestrials, hoping to find the destined one. In more than a month, the Underdark humans would hold an ancestral worship ceremony. All the tribes would bring the extraterrestrials to the holy mountain. Only the destined one could pass all the tests and finally awaken the ancient ancestor.</p><p>it seems like I can only go to that holy mountain if I want to know the secret!</p><p>However, Lu Ming looked at the map and frowned.</p><p>There were dozens of tribes between the holy mountain and the heavenly Wolf tribe. If he were to rush there, he would have to avoid the pursuit of the various tribes along the way. He didn’t know when he would reach the holy mountain.</p><p>Also, where is Xie nianqing now? How was it?</p><p>Lu Ming was very worried.</p><p>“Let’s rush to the holy mountain first!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the map and waved his hand. A giant wolf puppet appeared on the mountain peak.</p><p>This was the giant wave puppet that was equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Dandan, how do I use this puppet?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Although puppets were a branch of the Dao of inscription, Lu Ming had not come into contact with them.</p><p>it’s simple. Puppets are actually very similar to spirit weapons. They can be called a different type of spirit weapon, but there are still some differences. To control a puppet, it’s very simple. You just have to erase the imprint of its previous owner on the puppet, then inject your mental energy into it to control the inscription on the puppet. Then, you’ll naturally be able to control it!</p><p>Dandan answered.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming placed his palm on the giant wolf puppet’s head. A wisp of green mental energy fire seeped into the giant wolf puppet’s head. Lu Ming discovered that the inside of the puppet was engraved with dense inscriptions. These inscriptions interweaved with each other and were extremely profound.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. The path of puppets was extremely wonderful. He had even heard that there were powerful puppet masters who could even create puppets with consciousness. They could learn and think like humans. That would be amazing.</p><p>Lu Ming used his mental energy fire to erase the imprint of the puppet’s previous owner. Then, he spread his own mental energy fire into a large inscription array in the puppet’s mind. Immediately, a wonderful feeling welled up in his heart. He felt that he could control the puppet at will.</p><p>With a thought, the puppet roared and spread its wings. It soared into the air and circled around before returning to the mountain peak.</p><p>the rate at which mental fire is being consumed is truly shocking!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Controlling a puppet consumed a lot of spiritual energy. Without enough spiritual energy, it was difficult to control it.</p><p>The higher the level of the puppet, the more mind power it would consume.</p><p>However, at every level, Lu Ming had lit up ten mental lamps, all of which had reached perfection. The strength of his mental energy was very shocking.</p><p>He was much stronger and much thicker than many rank 6 true inscription refiners.</p><p>It should be enough to control this puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Lu Ming flew up and sat cross-legged on the back of the giant wolf puppet. The giant wolf puppet rose up and flew into the distance, towards the holy mountain.</p><p>He only needed to consume his spiritual power to ride on the puppet. The puppet’s speed was greatly increased. Soon, he had flown for tens of thousands of miles. From the map, he had already left the territory of the heavenly Wolf tribe and entered another tribe, the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was flying over a mountain range, roars came from all around the mountain range. Hundreds of figures flew up into the sky and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>These people were dressed like those from the heavenly Wolf tribe. They wore animal skins, but the puppets they rode were different.</p><p>The puppets they were riding on were Crimson cheetahs.</p><p>It also had wings and could soar in the sky.</p><p>“The heavenly Wolf tribe? No, it’s an outsider!”</p><p>At the forefront was a young man in his late twenties. He was burly and muscular, exuding an explosive aura. He was staring coldly at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He did not notice that there was someone below. The other party must have used an array to cover up their aura.</p><p>this person is actually riding on a divine level puppet from the heavenly Wolf tribe. It seems like he definitely knows the Dao of inscriptions. We have to be careful!</p><p>Beside the young man was a red-haired old man.</p><p>“He’s alone. What’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>The young man snorted.</p><p>Chi Feng, the clan elder has instructed us not to attack these outsiders if possible. We still need their help!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Hmph, I really don’t understand why the clan elder is so polite to these outsiders. He could have just captured them and forced them to go to the holy mountain. There’s no need to go through so much trouble!</p><p>The young man said coldly, appearing extremely overbearing.</p><p>The old man laughed bitterly and did not say much. He looked at Lu Ming and said, little brother, you must be an outsider. We have no ill intentions. We just want to ask you to return to the red leopard tribe with us. We need your help!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He had heard the conversation between the other party. However, how could he trust the other party?</p><p>“Get out of the way, I don’t want to start a pointless killing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Slaughter? What big words. Let’s see how you’re going to kill them all by yourself.”</p><p>The young man’s face darkened.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath. He controlled the giant wolf puppet and charged towards the first test.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant wolf puppet howled and its claws were as sharp as blades as it slashed forward. The terrifying power tore apart a few cheetah puppets.</p><p>“It’s a fourth-ranked divine puppet. Elder Crimson, you go and delay it. The others will surround it. If it continues to resist, just kill it!”</p><p>The young man coldly shouted.</p><p>The elder was helpless. He could only control the puppet to charge forward and fight Lu Ming.</p><p>The old man’s cheetah puppet was equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm and was extremely powerful. Sparks flew as it fought with Lu Ming’s giant wolf puppet.</p><p>The others used all sorts of arrows and runes to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>little brother, you’re only a heaven grade Alchemist. You won’t be able to control a fourth grade divine grade puppet for long. I advise you to surrender. I promise I won’t hurt you.</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not say a word. He continued to punch out with both fists. The fist radiance of the exploding star fist rumbled the air and blasted forward.</p><p>Some of the weaker puppets were killed by Lu Ming along with the humans.</p><p>However, it wasn’t just the old man who had a sea of soul realm puppet. There were seven or eight other people who had one, and those who could control them were all sixth rank inscription Masters with all kinds of inscription scrolls on them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
