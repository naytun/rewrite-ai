He kept the long spear and expressed his gratitude to elder Huang.</p><p>“Go. This time, I’ve studied your broken spear and have benefited a lot. I’m going to enter seclusion and properly comprehend it.”</p><p>Old Huang said as he waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and bowed. He then left and returned to his own courtyard.</p><p>With a move of his hand, a dark red long spear appeared. Lu Ming waved it noisily.</p><p>The long spear was like a dragon as it danced in the air. The sky was filled with dazzling spear radiance.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming kept his spear and stood still.</p><p>it’s indeed a good spear. The circulation of Zhen Yuan is extremely smooth, and Zhen Yuan can burst out as much as I want. It’s a great help to me in displaying my strength!</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>With this long spear, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased again.</p><p>“Let’s give this spear a name. What should I call it?”</p><p>“Since it’s based on Infinite Black Gold and can evolve infinitely, I’ll call it infinite spear. No, I’ll call it infinite Dragon Spear! That’s right, haha, that’s a nice name!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He looked at the long spear in his hands and grinned.</p><p>“So f * cking cliché!”</p><p>Dandan looked down on him.</p><p>“Hey, are you itching for a beating? How is it cliché? infinite Dragon Spear, how domineering!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved the long spear in his hands.</p><p>it’s just a spiritual weapon of the upper Sixth level. The inscription just passed the mark. What’s there to be happy about? I told you that the old man’s technique was not good. The materials were good, but they were wasted by him. If it were me, tsk tsk, hey, why are you looking at me like that? I’m a man. I have normal hobbies, not any bad ones!</p><p>Dandan began to boast shamelessly again. As it was speaking, it saw Lu Ming looking at it with a burning gaze. It was so frightened that it immediately shrank its head back into its turtle shell, leaving only its mouth to mumble.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up dandan carefully, his eyes darting around. dandan, you always say that you’re a peerless master, the head of the top ten warbeasts or something. Since you’re so powerful, why don’t you teach me some peerless martial arts, such as God-level martial arts techniques? How about eight or ten books? ”</p><p>“So that’s what you’re here for, no problem!”</p><p>Dandan’s head popped out of the turtle shell again. She stood up on her hind legs and stood on Lu Ming’s shoulders, her two claws on the turtle shell behind her back, looking like a peerless master.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and his heart was thumping.</p><p>If dandan really had a God-level martial technique, not to mention eight or ten books, even one or two books would be enough to make her rich.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming felt that his offensive martial arts technique was somewhat monotonous.</p><p>Although the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was powerful, it was difficult to cultivate. In a battle, it was an explosive martial technique that lacked some variations. If the opponent was prepared, they would be able to avoid it.</p><p>As for the three absolutes of Dragon God, it was the same. They were all explosive martial arts techniques. They were extremely powerful and could kill in one strike, but they lacked variation.</p><p>If the other party could block his attack, Lu Ming would have fewer tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>This was also something he had felt during the two battles with Qin Qingshan and the sacred constellation.</p><p>Lu Ming needed to cultivate other martial arts techniques to assist him.</p><p>After all, only one or two martial arts techniques were still a little lacking.</p><p>If he could give him a few, that would be great.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Dandan spoke. The two short words extinguished the flame in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>nest, without you, what’s there to be proud of? you’re a liar. You only know how to brag!</p><p>Lu Ming was unhappy and looked at dandan in disdain.</p><p>hey, kid, what’s with that expression? I can’t remember because I’m injured. Otherwise, let alone eight to ten God-level martial arts techniques, even if there were a hundred, I would still be able to take them out. Hmph!</p><p>Dandan said unhappily.</p><p>However, the look of disdain on Lu Ming’s face became even more obvious. He obviously did not believe dandan’s words.</p><p>How could Lu Ming believe that a hundred books of divine-level martial arts techniques were as common as cabbages on the roadside?</p><p>“You … “Ah, I’m so angry. Kid, I’ll tell you. Although I can’t remember the martial techniques, I still remember the Dao of inscription very clearly. I have the peerless Dao of inscription and the top-notch cultivation technique for cultivating the mental fire. Do you want me to teach you the Dao of inscription? I’ll make you convinced!”</p><p>Dandan was so angry that her eyes were wide open, and her turtle shell was moving up and down.</p><p>“The Dao of inscription?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Cultivating martial techniques already required a lot of thought and energy, so wouldn’t it be even more exhausting to cultivate the Dao of inscription? Lu Ming was a little hesitant.</p><p>Furthermore, the Dao of inscription was only a supplement and did not increase one’s combat power much.</p><p>hey, kid, do you think that the Dao of inscription can’t improve your combat power much? you’re really inexperienced. Let me tell you, none of the inscription Masters you’ve seen are qualified. They’re just cultivating casually to help with martial arts. There’s not a single true inscription master!</p><p>if you become a true inscription master, once you reach Level 5, your combat power will be terrifying. Martial artists of the same level will not be able to withstand a single blow. In ancient times, the Dao of inscription was prosperous. It was the main Dao, and it even suppressed the martial Dao. To true inscription Masters, challenging those of higher levels was a common occurrence!</p><p>Dandan glared at him and lectured.</p><p>“A true inscription refiner is that strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming was skeptical.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course. True inscription blacksmiths can inscribe auxiliary inscriptions, battle inscriptions, explosive inscriptions, divine weapon inscriptions, and so on. They can even inscribe peerless killing formations in an instant, killing the enemy without a trace. Do you want to learn? I have the top-notch mental fire cultivation method here. If this cultivation method were to be spread out, it would definitely result in an earth-shaking outcome. Even a more powerful existence would fight for it at all costs, let alone a Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>“Alright, how do I learn it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was tempted after hearing what dandan said.</p><p>give me some Jade talismans first. You don’t have any Foundation in the Dao of inscription, so I’ll inscribe some basic things, as well as mental cultivation methods and how to light up the mental fire. I’ll show you so that you have an idea of what to do!</p><p>Dandan said in a rare serious tone.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. With a wave of his hand, he took out more than ten crystal-clear Jade cards and threw them to dandan.</p><p>Dandan opened her mouth and more than a dozen Jade tokens flew into her mouth and disappeared.</p><p>Dandan’s mouth was like a bottomless pit. Lu Ming saw him swallowing everything into his mouth and taking out things from his mouth.</p><p>alright, I’m going to inscribe it now. You can cultivate in peace and wait for me for a few days!</p><p>Dandan leaped, ran into a room, and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming continued his cultivation.</p><p>Five days later, dandan appeared. She climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder and threw him a dozen Jade tokens. everything is inside. Take a look for yourself. Aiyo, this Lord is exhausted. Hurry up. For the sake of this Lord’s diligence, give me a few stalks of spirit medicine!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He casually took out a few stalks of Level 5 spiritual herbs and threw them to dandan. After dismissing her, he walked into the room and started to look at them.</p><p>He stuck the Jade token between his brows and naturally understood the contents of the Jade token.</p><p>This Jade tablet contained some basic knowledge about the Dao of inscription. It was extremely complicated.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and digested the information carefully.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
