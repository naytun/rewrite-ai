You should all have the basics of alchemy. At that time, there will be an alchemy teacher in the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy who will teach you. Of course, you can also exchange ideas with the teacher!</p><p>...</p><p>A skinny middle-aged man appeared in front of the crowd and introduced them loudly.</p><p>it’s still early, so I’ll show you the front yard of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. There are some finished pills there, so you can learn from each other!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>Then, he led everyone to the back.</p><p>Everyone followed closely behind.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that there were hundreds of them. There were men, women, old and young. It was very diverse and they came from all over the world.</p><p>The crowd followed the middle-aged man and walked around the front yard.</p><p>The front yard was very large and was formed by several huge peaks. There were palaces and pavilions everywhere, and a faint medicinal fragrance could be smelled.</p><p>In some places, there were even medicine fields with all kinds of spiritual herbs growing on them.</p><p>These herb fields were all guarded by specialized people. These people were either skilled in the water or Wood Concepts. They were the most suitable people to cultivate spirit herbs.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there should be an assessment later to test your alchemy skills. Are you sure you can do it?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked in a low voice.</p><p>“I should … It’s fine, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the Dao of inscription, there were different preferences, and there were also a few major branches, such as those that were inclined to refining weapons, alchemy, or inscriptions and formations.</p><p>However, they all had one thing in common, which was that one needed to use mental fire and inscriptions.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming’s inscription had no problems at all. The number of inscriptions from level one to level three that he had mastered was enough to make those old monsters who had studied inscriptions for hundreds or thousands of years feel ashamed.</p><p>However, alchemy not only required inscriptions, but also the identification of spiritual herbs and the prescription.</p><p>In the past two months, Lu Ming had learned more than ten of the most common pill refining methods from dandan. He had refined them when he had the time and his skills were quite good.</p><p>As long as it was not too difficult to refine the pills, Lu Ming believed that it would be okay.</p><p>“Really?” Xie nianqing was skeptical. In her impression, Lu Ming was a pure martial artist and did not cultivate the inscription Dao to assist him.</p><p>“Have you ignited your Spirit Fire?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>it was ignited a few months ago! Lu Ming answered honestly.</p><p>“How many months has it been?” Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>However, the good thing was that even if he failed later on, he would not be chased out. He could still stay and study, but the treatment would be different.</p><p>The group crossed a small bridge over a flowing river, walked past the pavilions, and followed the middle-aged man to a large hall.</p><p>The moment everyone arrived at the main hall, they could smell the medicinal fragrance.</p><p>In the hall, there were shelves. On the shelves, there were some small Jade boxes with pills on them.</p><p>these pills were refined by the disciples of the cloud Sea alchemy institution. You can take a look and compare it with your own alchemy skills!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>Everyone began to look around in the hall.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were also watching.</p><p>The medicinal pills here ranged from level one to level four. Each pill was full of color, round, and had a medicinal fragrance that made one feel comfortable all over.</p><p>On the surface of many of the pills, there were fine inscriptions engraved on them, making them look very beautiful.</p><p>Golden Crow pill, essence enhancing pill, wood returning pill …</p><p>Lu Ming saw at least dozens of different types of pills.</p><p>these pills are full and round, and their purity is very high. It’s a pity that the inscriptions are still a little lacking, causing the fusion of the spiritual herbs to not reach a perfect stage. The medicinal effects are also a little lacking!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a vitality pill and looked at it. He muttered as he looked at it.</p><p>“This is still lacking? Is that true?”</p><p>At the side, Xie nianqing was speechless. Lu Ming had only been in contact with the Dao of inscription for a few months. Could he really tell the quality of these pills?</p><p>“Hmph, you’re really full of yourself. Most of these pills were made by the elite disciples of the cloud Sea alchemy institution. Each one is full and the inscriptions are very profound. Each one of these pills is of high quality. Even if I were to make them, I would only be a little better than this. What do you know?”</p><p>A sarcastic voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and saw a young man in a blue robe sneering at him.</p><p>This blue-robed young man was Gu Huaxu, the one who tried to hit on Xie nianqing but was rejected.</p><p>Then, Gu Huaxu turned to Xie nianqing and said, ” miss, your friend is really nothing much. He only knows how to talk big and has no real talent. Miss, I advise you to stay away from him as soon as possible!</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Gu Huaxu and said, ” “What does it matter to you who I’m with?”</p><p>Hmph, you really don’t know what a good person’s heart is like. A fresh flower stuck in cow dung!</p><p>Gu Huaxu snorted coldly and walked away.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. This brother was really sick.</p><p>Everyone watched in the hall for a while. After about half an hour, the middle-aged man said, ” alright, it’s almost time. You guys can come with me!</p><p>The group followed the middle-aged man to a square.</p><p>“Look, miss Yun Haitang is here!”</p><p>At this moment, someone pointed at the sky and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky and saw three figures approaching.</p><p>In the middle, there was a young woman.</p><p>This woman looked to be in her twenties and was extremely beautiful. She wore a tight red chiffon dress that outlined her impressive figure.</p><p>This was a stunning beauty. Most men would be moved by her.</p><p>Two elders stood beside the woman. They exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>“A late stage King tier!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell that the two elders were both at the level of a King’s Tier.</p><p>However, the young woman was obviously the leader of the three.</p><p>The three of them landed on the square, and the crowd was in an uproar.</p><p>Most of the men, regardless of their age, were staring at Yun Haitang with burning eyes.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that miss Yun Haitang would receive us in person this time. Is she going to exchange alchemy knowledge with us this time? That’s great!”</p><p>it is said that miss Yun Haitang is not only the most beautiful woman in the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, but also the most skilled Alchemist among the younger generation. Her alchemy skills are already extremely profound, surpassing many of the older generation. This time, I must have a good experience to learn from her!</p><p>hey, I think you’re just pretending to ask for advice. You’re really trying to get close to miss Yun Haitang, aren’t you? you’re already so old, but you still don’t have any self-respect!</p><p>“So what if I’m older? You can still have spring when you’re older.”</p><p>The scene was noisy.</p><p>“These stinky men!”</p><p>At the scene, some of the women looked at the men with disdain.</p><p>“How is it? Isn’t she beautiful?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“It’s very beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Hmph!” Xie nianqing’s lips began to curl up.</p><p>“However, compared to you, I’m still far from it!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
