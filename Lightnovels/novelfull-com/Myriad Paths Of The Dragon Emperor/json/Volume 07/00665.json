The Dragon God’s three absolutes were divided into three moves. The third move, extreme strike, had an extremely strong penetrating power and an unquestionable attacking power.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the true dragon Strike and ten thousand Dragon kill were much weaker.</p><p>As for the explosive star fist, it was a pure killing move. Each punch was like the explosion of a meteorite. In terms of power, it was even stronger than the true dragon Strike.</p><p>The destructive power of the fifth level of the explosive star fist was not weaker than that of the true dragon Strike.</p><p>One after another, the fist radiance struck out like the true dragon Strike. How terrifying was the power?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming gained the upper hand. He defeated the sea snake that was condensed from seawater. The powerful fist force landed on the body of the deep-sea Giant snake.</p><p>The fist force landed on the body of the giant deep-sea snake, causing it to roar continuously.</p><p>However, the body of the giant deep-sea snake was covered with scales, and its defense was very terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, the fist force of the explosive star fist had been offset by the sea snakes condensed by the seawater, so it could only hurt the deep sea Giant snake, but not hurt him.</p><p>However, this had already infuriated the giant deep-sea snake.</p><p>It roared angrily and rose into the air, pouncing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It opened its mouth wide and black gas billowed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Poisonous gas!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, when one of them was touched by the poisonous gas, he immediately felt a burning pain on his skin. The poisonous gas was rapidly corroding his skin.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>lu ming controlled the devouring power of the nine dragons ‘bloodline. immediately, all the poisonous gas was devoured by the bloodline.</p><p>“Second bloodline, explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s second blood Meridian burst out and his strength increased by another level. He threw more than a hundred punches in a row, dispersing the poisonous gas in front of him. The tongue of the deep sea Giant snake was like a sword, wrapped in a layer of black liquid, which increased its power greatly.</p><p>Whoosh! whoosh!</p><p>The snake’s tongue flickered wildly, crushing Lu Ming’s fist force.</p><p>After Lu Ming threw more than a hundred punches, the infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hands. He looked down from above and pulled out the spear.</p><p>The long spear turned into a thousand meters long and struck the giant snake’s body. The giant snake let out a long hiss and its body was blasted down.</p><p>Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!</p><p>Lu Ming took four steps in the air.</p><p>The violent power continued to blast towards the giant snake. Its target was the seven-inch position of the giant snake.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the seven-inch point of the giant snake, it suddenly exploded. Scales flew everywhere, and blood splashed everywhere.</p><p>However, the giant snake’s defense was too strong. Most of the force was blocked by its scales. Although a large piece of flesh was blown off, it was only a superficial wound for the giant snake’s huge body.</p><p>However, this superficial wound was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, his body followed suit and fell rapidly. Just as he was about to reach the giant snake, he brazenly launched his strongest attack.</p><p>An extreme strike!</p><p>The spear merged with his body and turned into a dazzling spear radiance, which was aimed at the wound of the giant snake.</p><p>The wound earlier was for this attack.</p><p>It was a fatal blow.</p><p>The giant snake seemed to sense a fatal threat. It exerted all its strength and spat out a black poisonous mist at Lu Ming.</p><p>The poisonous mist had almost turned into a liquid. It was so terrifying that even an ordinary fifth-level spiritual weapon would be corroded and melted.</p><p>Unfortunately, it had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>With the protection of the nine Dragons bloodline, Lu Ming was not afraid of the poisonous gas at all.</p><p>The devouring power enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body. He dashed forward and the dazzling Spear’s gleam pierced through the wound on the giant snake’s seven-inch head. It then came out from the other side.</p><p>The seven-inch mark was the vital point of the snake. Lu Ming’s move had pierced a huge hole in the vital point of the giant snake.</p><p>hiss … hiss …</p><p>The giant snake’s eyes were wide open, and it let out an unwilling roar. It fell into the sea, rolled a few times in the sea, and then stopped, motionless.</p><p>A deep sea Giant snake at the spiritual ocean tier was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the other side, where the King of Hell was.</p><p>A dazzling sword light that was extremely sharp seemed to be able to cut through everything.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The giant snake’s head was almost cut off. More than half of it had been cut off, leaving only a little hanging.</p><p>The other giant snake was also killed.</p><p>Hell King’s figure appeared, but his black robe was torn in some places, revealing the Golden robe inside. He was in a slightly sorry state.</p><p>The speed at which he killed the giant snake was only a few breaths slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, his gaze was also on Lu Ming. His eyes flickered and he said, ” “You win this time, but I won’t lose next time!”</p><p>“Actually, you didn’t lose!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Hell King’s strength had shocked him.</p><p>The second level of the metal will. The hell King’s will had already reached the second level. As long as he opened the spirit ocean, he would immediately become a Sea of Souls realm warrior.</p><p>Moreover, hell King’s bloodline martial skill was also extremely powerful. It was even more powerful than Xue gang’s bloodline martial skill.</p><p>The King of Hell’s actual combat strength was definitely not weaker than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming could kill the giant snake first was that he was not afraid of the poisonous gas attack.</p><p>“A loss is a loss, no matter what the reason is!”</p><p>The King of Hell said calmly.</p><p>At this moment, the nearby human martialists were first extremely shocked, then extremely excited.</p><p>Two deep sea Giant snakes in the spiritual ocean tier had been killed by King Yama and Asura.</p><p>A martial King had actually killed a warrior in the spiritual ocean tier. This was simply unbelievable. In the past, this had only been heard of in legends.</p><p>The Warriors who had been to the life battle platform had different thoughts.</p><p>the battle between King Yama and Asura has finally ended. Asura is stronger!</p><p>Such a thought flashed through many people’s minds.</p><p>“There’s still some more. Why don’t we continue?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the battle in the sky. It was a battle at the level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>King Yama’s body revealed a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A beam of sword light and a beam of spear light shot up into the sky at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming and the King of Hell were going to participate in the battle between sea of soul realm experts. As long as they killed one or two more sea of soul realm demons, the scales of victory would tilt in the favor of the humans.</p><p>Lu Ming did not consume the blood essence of the giant deep-sea snake.</p><p>He had already devoured enough blood essence, and the bloodline of the nine Dragons was still slowly being refined.</p><p>The blood essence of the spirit sea was too powerful. If he devoured it, Lu Ming would not be able to control it. He would have to find a place to refine it and he would not be able to continue fighting.</p><p>In the sky, the formation was extremely intense. The human warriors and the sea of soul realm beasts both had an advantage, and the battle was extremely fierce. For now, no one could determine the winner.</p><p>A blue-robed burly man was currently engaged in a fierce battle with a tiger shark. This tiger shark had a cultivation of the late first level spiritual ocean tier, which was even more powerful than the deep sea Giant snake from before.</p><p>However, the blue-robed man’s cultivation was not weak either. His cultivation was also at the late-stage first level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The blue-robed man and the tiger shark were both injured.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed toward the battlefield.</p><p>haha, little friend, you’ve come at the right time. Help me kill this beast!</p><p>The blue-robed burly man burst out laughing excitedly when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>He had seen Lu Ming kill the giant deep-sea snake.</p><p>They were fighting in the sky, but they would also pay attention to the battles in other places and observe the situation at all times.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
