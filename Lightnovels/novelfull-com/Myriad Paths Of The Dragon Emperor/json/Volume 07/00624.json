It was an extremely famous force other than the Emperor heaven divine Palace and a few other Overlord forces.</p><p>This force mainly focused on alchemy. They were very famous for their alchemy skills and the pills they made were also sought after by many.</p><p>Most importantly, the cloud Sea alchemy institution had a good reputation and reputation.</p><p>Every month, the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy would open its doors. Warriors who liked alchemy could enter the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy and study there for three months.</p><p>In these three months, the alchemy Masters of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy would impart their experience and alchemy skills. Everything was free.</p><p>It was because of this that the cloud Sea alchemy institution was able to survive under the influence of the overlords. It was also able to live a comfortable life and become stronger.</p><p>Their goal was to go to the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy and take one of their treasures, the heavenly demon fruit.</p><p>cough, cough. It doesn’t seem very good for us to snatch other people’s treasures for no reason!</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming coughed a few times.</p><p>Lu Ming was a man of principle. Unless it was an enemy, he would not snatch someone else’s treasure for no reason.</p><p>Furthermore, this power had a good reputation.</p><p>“I’m doing this for the people. Do you really think the cloud Sea alchemy institution is as good as the rumors say? That’s just a trick the people of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy used to deceive the world. I’ve already investigated clearly. The things that the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy has done in the dark can be said to be infuriating and infuriating to both man and God!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Follow me, I’ll take you to see!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. The two of them flew and a few days passed in a flash.</p><p>They were already within the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy’s sphere of influence.</p><p>The two of them landed on a mountain range and walked forward. There was a small town in front of them. Most of the residents were ordinary people, but there were also a few low-level martial artists.</p><p>The two of them strolled around the town.</p><p>“How is it? did you see anything?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and his brows furrowed even more.</p><p>“The people in this town are very strange. Most of them don’t have much vitality, especially the children.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right. Do you know why?” Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. During this period of time, he had made great progress in the Dao of inscription. Naturally, his vision was different. He thought of a possibility.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, Xie nianqing had already started explaining, ” that’s because the people from the cloud Sea alchemy institution often come here and secretly extract the innate blood Qi of the babies. When the babies are born, the acquired Qi is not strong, so the innate blood Qi is the most useful. They use the innate blood Qi to make pills. As a result, the babies who have their innate blood Qi extracted will not live past 30 years old when they grow up!</p><p>it’s enough for the people of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy to live to thirty years old. They’ve already married and had children. Their children will end up the same way. Perhaps in the eyes of the people of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, these ordinary people are just some animals they raise or some human-shaped spiritual herbs!</p><p>“Beast? A human-shaped spirit herb?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. A cold killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>If that was the case, the cloud Sea alchemy institution was a group of greedy demons and scumbags.</p><p>it’s not just this town. All the remote towns and villages within a million miles of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy are in a similar situation. Most of these villagers are ordinary people. The strongest are only Warriors. They haven’t traveled too far in their lives. They think that people will die at about 30 years old.</p><p>Xie nianqing sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p>These people could have lived to 80 or 90 years old, but because their connate blood Qi had been extracted when they were babies, their lifespans had been greatly reduced. They thought that everyone could only live to 30 years old. How sad was this?</p><p>“The cloud Sea Alchemy Academy does far more than this in the dark. They use this infant’s blood and Qi to concoct pills and then sell them at a high price to some martial artists in the chaotic Astral Ocean who practice evil techniques, making a huge profit!”</p><p>Xie nianqing explained. He seemed to have investigated the cloud Sea elixir dispensary very thoroughly.</p><p>“Let’s go. I’d like to meet this Cloud Sea Alchemy Academy!”</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes had disappeared. However, his tone was very cold.</p><p>The cloud Sea Alchemy Academy was located on a magnificent mountain range. It was as beautiful as a Fairyland, with a magnificent atmosphere and dense spiritual Qi.</p><p>The cloud Sea alchemy institution was actually a family called the Yun family. Because they often opened their doors and taught alchemy to others, they were later called the cloud Sea alchemy institution. It was said that the head of the Yun family was a sea of soul realm expert.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming and the rest could not just charge in like this. They planned to sneak in and check out the situation first.</p><p>In the past few days, the cloud Sea city in front of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy’s Gate had become lively.</p><p>This was because the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy opened its doors every month to impart the art of alchemy. Warriors from all over the Yunfeng region who were interested in alchemy had gathered here. There were even people from other regions.</p><p>The two of them came at the right time. Tomorrow was the opening day of the cloud Sea alchemy institution, so the two of them started to stroll around the cloud Sea city.</p><p>Along the way, it attracted the attention of many passers-by.</p><p>It was mainly due to Xie nianqing’s beauty. Such a beautiful woman was rare in the world.</p><p>“Young lady, are you also going to the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy to learn alchemy?”</p><p>A slender and handsome young man walked over and asked with a smile. His eyes were fixed on Xie nianqing, revealing a trace of passion.</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at him coldly and did not answer.</p><p>“Miss, I am Gu Huaxu, the young master of the Gu family. This must be your first time in Cloud Sea city, right? If you don’t mind, I’m willing to show you around Cloud Sea city!”</p><p>The young man continued, revealing his family background as he stared at Xie nianqing without blinking.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had completely ignored him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned and coldly spat out a word.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s face darkened. Xie nianqing actually told him to get lost?</p><p>There had never been a woman who dared to speak to him like this.</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, Gu Huaxu strode away. Before he left, Gu Huaxu shot Lu Ming a murderous look.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and was completely speechless.</p><p>He didn’t even say a word and was directly implicated.</p><p>However, he knew Xie nianqing well. When the young man came up to greet him, he already knew that this would be the result.</p><p>The two of them continued to walk around for a while. They found a restaurant to have a meal and then found an Inn to rest.</p><p>The next day, it was time for the opening of the cloud Sea alchemy institution. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left the cloud Sea city and headed for the institution.</p><p>It was easy to enter the cloud Sea alchemy institution. You just had to fill in some basic information.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were about a few hundred people who had entered the cloud Sea alchemy institution to study.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
