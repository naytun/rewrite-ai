The Supreme divine beast had been extinct for many years in the East barren continent.</p><p>...</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had obtained a piece of the true Dragon’s finger bone. However, the bone had been around for many years and its spirituality had almost completely dissipated. There was not much essence left.</p><p>However, the spiritual essence of this true dragon’s blood had been completely preserved. Its value was incomparable.</p><p>It was no wonder that the flood Dragon was so desperate to rush into the hall.</p><p>The temptation of a true dragon’s blood to a flood Dragon was too strong, so strong that it was beyond imagination. If a flood Dragon swallowed this true dragon’s blood, it would undergo an amazing transformation and have endless potential in the future.</p><p>It seemed that the flood Dragon had attacked the island because of the true dragon’s blood. He wondered how the flood Dragon knew that the seven-colored Island had true dragon’s blood.</p><p>“I want to eat it, I want to eat this true dragon’s blood!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes widened, and she screamed loudly. She strode out with her two small legs and ran madly towards the true dragon’s blood.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline emerged. He roared loudly, filled with an incomparable desire.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon roared and its body expanded rapidly. It whipped its tail and hit dandan, sending her flying.</p><p>“Ah, you little worm, you dare to slap this Lord? this Lord isn’t done with you!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and then hit the wall of the hall, directly hitting a pit and embedding itself inside.</p><p>little bug, you’re dead, you’re dead. Aiyo, my old back!</p><p>Dandan’s cursing voice came out.</p><p>Lu Ming was relieved. He knew that this guy had amazing defense and it would not be so easy for him to get into trouble.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the flood Dragon sent dandan flying, it directly pounced towards the blood of the true dragon.</p><p>“Stop it!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, his long spear expanding rapidly as he charged at the flood Dragon.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his hand and the sky demon force field burst out, covering the Dragon.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The flood Dragon let out a loud roar as a huge halberd flew out and struck Lu Ming’s spear radiance. The flood Dragon’s huge body trembled and Xie nianqing’s expression changed as he was forced back.</p><p>The flood Dragon was simply too powerful. Although it was only at the early stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm, it could suppress the spiritual practitioner han Dao, who was at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm, and fight with three experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. It was even possible that the old freak Lu Xuan was killed by the flood Dragon.</p><p>Although the flood Dragon was severely injured and its combat strength had been greatly reduced, its strength was definitely not weaker than the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were no match for it.</p><p>After repelling Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, the flood Dragon flew forward, opened its mouth, and swallowed the Dragon blood in one gulp.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the flood Dragon swallowed the dragon’s blood, it let out an excited roar that shook the sky.</p><p>A layer of blood-red light covered the flood Dragon’s body. Its injuries were healing at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>The effects of the dragon’s blood were indeed astonishing, especially for the flood Dragon. It had already taken effect so quickly.</p><p>Not only that, but the aura on the flood Dragon’s body was also rising rapidly.</p><p>“Let’s go, we need to leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. Since they could not get the true dragon’s blood, they had to leave as soon as possible. If they waited for the flood Dragon to recover, it would be too late for them to leave.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dandan flew out from the wall and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder, still cursing.</p><p>“Who is it? Who are you? Get out, get out!”</p><p>At this moment, the flood Dragon suddenly let out a crazed roar.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were a little stunned. Were these words directed at them? But it didn’t look like it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, look! There’s something wrong with the flood dragon’s eyes!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the flood dragon’s eyes. Apart from excitement and ecstasy, there was also fear and horror in its eyes.</p><p>“Get out, get out, get out of my body!”</p><p>The flood Dragon roared and its huge body actually rolled around in the hall.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve waited for 800 years and finally found a flood Dragon. You want me to get out? How was that possible? Let this old man borrow your body!”</p><p>An old voice came out of the flood Dragon’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were extremely shocked.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>it’s fake. You deliberately left clues outside and left behind this true dragon’s blood. It’s all fake!</p><p>The flood Dragon roared madly.</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t wait for 800 years in vain. I’ll finally return to this world!</p><p>The old voice laughed again.</p><p>A layer of blood mist spread out from the flood dragon’s head, making it look very strange.</p><p>“Seven-colored Daoist! That’s a seven-colored Daoist!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he thought of a possibility.</p><p>But how was that possible? The seven-colored Daoist was only at the spirit embryo realm. How could he have survived until now? furthermore, it looked like he was going to possess the flood Dragon.</p><p>good move, good move. The seven-colored Daoist is a rank 7 true inscription refiner. He fused his consciousness into the mental energy fire and sealed it with the true dragon’s blood. This way, it can be preserved for 800 years. As long as the flood Dragon swallows the dragon’s blood and the blood flows through its body, he can destroy the flood dragon’s soul and occupy its body!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes flickered as she spoke.</p><p>“Hahaha! I didn’t think that a little turtle would have so much knowledge!”</p><p>The ancient voice said.</p><p>“Get out, get out!”</p><p>The flood Dragon kept shouting.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? it’s your honor that your body is being used by this old man. In the future, this old man will let your name shake the world.”</p><p>The old voice sneered.</p><p>kill me! Kill me now! As long as you kill me, it’s useless for this old man to occupy my body. I’d rather die than have my body become a puppet!</p><p>The flood Dragon suddenly looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Juniors, if you dare to ruin this old man’s plan, I’ll make sure you die without a burial place!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist coldly shouted.</p><p>“Hurry up, I can’t hold on much longer. If this old man takes over my body, he will definitely kill you all. He won’t let anyone else know this secret.”</p><p>The flood Dragon roared. His eyes flickered and his speech was no longer smooth. It seemed that he could not hold on any longer.</p><p>His soul was about to be destroyed.</p><p>The soul of a demonic beast was weaker than that of a human.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s attack. The flood Dragon is right. If the seven-colored Daoist succeeds, he won’t let us off!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was firm. He had made up his mind and was ready to take action.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon let out a shocking roar. It actually stretched out a sharp claw and clawed at its own chest.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist roared as if he was fighting for control of the flood Dragon’s body. This reduced the power of the claw, but the scales on the flood dragon’s chest were still torn off, and blood flowed out.</p><p>you guys attack here. This is the vital point!</p><p>The flood Dragon let out a deep voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
