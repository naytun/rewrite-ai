Beside him, five sea of soul realm experts flew toward the battlefield below, while he and the green mysterious old monster flew toward the flood Dragon.</p><p>Together with the spiritual practitioner han Dao, they surrounded the flood Dragon.</p><p>The cultivation of the red-haired old monster and the green-faced old monster was the same as the cold saber Spirit Warrior-they were both at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>a flood Dragon’s entire body is full of treasures. If we kill it, we’ll split it equally among the three of us!</p><p>The red-haired old monster’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do it!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three terrifying auras shot up into the sky. At the same time, two sword lights and a Green Pearl attacked the flood Dragon. The flood Dragon roared and charged forward.</p><p>haha, our reinforcements are here. Kill, kill these bastards!</p><p>Many human warriors shouted.</p><p>This time, seven spiritual ocean tier elites from the human race came all at once. Two were against the flood Dragon, and the other five joined the battle, instantly turning the situation around. The human race had a complete advantage in terms of high-end battle power.</p><p>Not only were all the Sea of Souls realm beasts blocked, but there were also extra Sea of Souls realm experts on the human side who were constantly hunting those sea beasts.</p><p>On the ocean, there were countless corpses of humans and sea beasts.</p><p>“So much blood essence!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had devoured a lot of blood essence. Most of them were peak-tier Kings ‘blood essence. After the battle began, Lu Ming had devoured more than fifty peak-tier Kings’ blood essence.</p><p>He felt that his nine Dragon bloodline was almost full. He really wanted to find a place to refine it.</p><p>But now, he could only slowly refine it while fighting.</p><p>Up until now, the human race had suffered countless losses, but they had finally gained the upper hand. With the addition of spiritual ocean tier elites, they were like breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, and a large number of sea beasts were killed.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Finally, the sea beasts were scared. One of the great demons of the spirit sea shouted and gathered the sea beasts to retreat into the sea.</p><p>In terms of high-end combat power, the humans had already gained the upper hand. If the battle continued, the sea beasts would be completely annihilated sooner or later.</p><p>“Lord flood Dragon, this is all we can help you with!”</p><p>A giant octopus spoke. It then gathered the sea beasts and retreated into the ocean.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The ocean waves surged and turned into a thousand-meter tall wave. Countless sea beasts hid in the waves and disappeared.</p><p>Once a sea beast entered the sea and focused on escaping, it would be difficult for martial artists to pursue it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the sky, the flood Dragon roared repeatedly. It was besieged by three experts at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier and was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>In just a short while, a few wounds appeared on the flood Dragon’s body. Its scales were torn apart and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Kill, kill this flood Dragon!”</p><p>Some martial artists shouted.</p><p>However, the flood Dragon was clearly no match for him, but it refused to retreat.</p><p>The blue divine light kept bursting out from the flood Dragon’s body, attacking the three spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>At the same time, the flood Dragon’s body continued to shrink. In a few breaths, a middle-aged man in blue armor appeared in the air. He held a halberd in his hand. With a wave of the halberd, the spirit Warrior han Dao was forced back.</p><p>In human form, this burly man in battle armor was a flood Dragon.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flood Dragon forced back the spiritual practitioner han Dao and turned into a rainbow light, shooting toward the depths of the Golden sand island.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao, the red monster and the Green Monster all chased after the flood Dragon and disappeared into the sky.</p><p>At this time, countless sea beasts had retreated into the ocean and escaped, leaving countless corpses on the surface of the sea.</p><p>“Ah, that tiger shark is mine.”</p><p>“That’s mine!”</p><p>Countless Warriors were flying above the ocean, putting the dead bodies of the sea beasts into their storage rings.</p><p>Many parts of these sea beasts ‘bodies were precious materials that could be used to refine weapons, elixirs, and so on. They were very valuable, so of course, these Warriors were tempted.</p><p>“Get lost! This is mine!”</p><p>Some people roared, and a great battle even broke out.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and appeared in front of a huge deep-sea Giant snake.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>One of the peak-tier Kings did not even look and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, when he saw Lu Ming’s appearance, he was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He hurriedly retracted his knife.</p><p>“Shura!”</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>“You want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>no, no, it’s a misunderstanding. This deep-sea Giant snake is yours.</p><p>The peak-tier King laughed as he hurriedly turned around and left.</p><p>brat, get lost! The corpse of a sea of soul realm beast, you can take it if it’s not dead.</p><p>A man in his thirties with a tall nose flew over at high speed.</p><p>This was a powerful warrior of the spiritual ocean tier, a group of powerful warriors who had arrived later to help. He did not see Lu Ming kill the great demon of the spiritual ocean, and only thought that Lu Ming was an ordinary peak-tier King.</p><p>Before he even arrived, his powerful aura was already pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and appeared on the body of the giant deep-sea snake. He placed his palm on the snake’s wound and sucked, swallowing the nine drops of blood essence.</p><p>Then, his figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>His target was the blood essence of the giant deep-sea snake. As for the corpse of the giant deep-sea snake, although it was precious, he didn’t care much about it.</p><p>And now, he needed to refine the blood essence and didn’t want to get into a conflict with others.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not touch the giant deep-sea snake, the tall-nosed man cast a cold glance at Lu Ming, then waved his hand and kept the huge body of the giant deep-sea snake into his storage ring.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The blood essence of a sea of soul realm beast was too terrifying. Once it was swallowed into the nine Dragon bloodline, it was like a volcano erupting, constantly impacting the nine Dragon bloodline and making rumbling sounds.</p><p>He had wanted to devour more blood essence, but it seemed that he could not do it.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go. I need you to protect me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>He had to find a place to refine the blood essence.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and flew towards the city with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, at this moment, an earth-shaking sound suddenly came from the depths of the Golden sand island. Then, everyone saw a beam of seven-colored divine light shooting into the sky. Although it was far away, they could still feel the magnificence of the divine light.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire golden sand island started to shake.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The seven-colored divine light was even more dazzling. It broke through the clouds and rushed into the sky.</p><p>“Then what’s going on? What is this seven-colored light pillar?”</p><p>“Could it be related to the flood Dragon?”</p><p>“Possible? The beast tide this time is very abnormal. I suspect that it’s organized by that flood Dragon. There must be a purpose!”</p><p>The martial artists present looked at the Rainbow divine light in a daze, and some of them whispered among themselves.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were also shocked as they stood in the void to watch.</p><p>The seven-colored divine light became more and more dazzling, and its light completely outshined the sun in the sky.</p><p>All of a sudden, after a violent boom, the seven-colored divine light disappeared. Instead, an Island appeared.</p><p>A floating island.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
