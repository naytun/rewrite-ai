Lu Ming now felt that it might be true. Perhaps dandan could really see something.</p><p>it’s a little like possession, but the difficulty of possession is not small. It requires a series of coincidences, otherwise it’s very difficult to succeed!</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>“Possession?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed. There was disbelief in their eyes.</p><p>They had also heard of the legend of possession.</p><p>It was said that when a martial artist cultivated to the spiritual God Realm and condensed a spiritual God, even if his physical body was destroyed, the spiritual God would not collapse for a while.</p><p>He could even use his spiritual God to possess another body and be reborn.</p><p>However, possession wasn’t as easy as one would imagine. Once a spirit God left the body, it was extremely weak and wouldn’t exist for long. The most important thing was that everyone’s will was extremely strong, and it even involved the laws of life.</p><p>Basically, it was impossible for a spirit God to possess someone else’s body. If a spirit God wanted to possess someone else’s body, they would often end up in a situation where they would be reduced to ashes.</p><p>But in history, there were also successful cases of possession, but they were too few.</p><p>Could it be that Gu Huaxu’s body had been possessed by a powerful being?</p><p>At this moment, Gu Huaxu’s expression changed.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll let you two off for now, but I’ll take your lives in the future!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu snorted and quickly retreated into the tunnel.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The two of them quickly chased after him.</p><p>The three of them, one in front and one at the back, moved forward and passed through the East and West Bay. After a while, a huge underground cave appeared in front of them.</p><p>Blood-red gemstones were embedded in the stone walls of the underground cave, scattering blood-red rays of light.</p><p>In the middle of the underground cave, there was actually a medicinal field, growing more than a dozen kinds of spirit herbs.</p><p>“Haha, blood infant fruit, Dragon poison fruit, my senses were indeed correct!”</p><p>As soon as Gu Huaxu arrived here, he revealed a look of ecstasy and charged towards the fruit trees.</p><p>“The heavenly demon fruit!”</p><p>Xie nianqing immediately saw a fruit tree as tall as a man. It was pitch black and there was only one fruit on it. It was the size of a fist and had strange patterns on its surface.</p><p>This was the heavenly demon fruit that Xie nianqing needed.</p><p>Xie nianqing pounced toward the heavenly demon fruit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the air trembled violently. The vibrations were so dense that it was as if there were countless bees flying around. However, the sound of the vibrations was thousands of times stronger than that of the bees!</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, beetles flew out from the ground of these fruit trees like bullets, piercing through Gu Huaxu and Xie nianqing.</p><p>His speed was shockingly fast.</p><p>The vibrations were caused by the flapping of the beetle’s wings.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed softly and rushed over quickly.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his palm down, and the powerful sky demon force field enveloped the beetles. However, the speed of the beetles was only slightly affected, and they continued to rush toward Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky demon cut!”</p><p>An extremely sharp cutting power burst out, and a wind blade-like cutting power cut toward the beetles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The powerful cutting force cut the beetles, but it produced the sound of metal clashing and sparks flying.</p><p>Only a few beetles were cut in half, and the rest were only sent flying. After a moment of delay, they charged again.</p><p>On the other side, a short sword appeared in Gu Huaxu’s hand. He kept on slashing, but the result was the same. Only a few of the beetles were killed, and the rest were sent flying.</p><p>sacred beetle! Damn it! Why are there sacred beetles here? ”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>The beetles flew up again, and there were no less than a thousand of them.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and a huge Spear’s gleam condensed in his hand. He swept it out and dozens of scarabs were swept away like bullets. They crashed into the surrounding walls, blasting big holes in them.</p><p>However, more scarabs pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; this type of sacred beetle had a long, sharp thorn in its mouth. It was clearly not ordinary, and no one wanted to be pierced by it.</p><p>“Little Qing, pick the heavenly demon fruit and retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>juniors, none of you can leave today. All of you can stay!</p><p>At this time, a bone-chilling voice rang out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky above the cave, a vast and terrifying aura pressed down.</p><p>This aura gave people the feeling that they were facing a vast ocean.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a sea of soul realm expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>It seemed that the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy had already taken precautions and had been waiting for them here.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He immediately used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and turned into a ray of light. In a flash, he dodged the large group of scarabs and rushed toward the SkyDemon fruit.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, he swept his long spear and the group of scarabs in front of him were swept away. He then swept his quintessential essence forward and caught the SkyDemon fruit. He pulled it back and put it into Lu Ming’s storage ring.</p><p>“The heavenly demon fruit is in my hands, let’s go!”</p><p>run! Lu Ming shouted as he flew towards the exit at top speed. At the same time, Xie nianqing retreated quickly.</p><p>“Junior, stay here!”</p><p>An angry shout rang out, and two powerful forces pressed down on the two people’s heads at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>There were two rings of fire, and they exuded a shocking pressure.</p><p>it’s so hot! That’s the second level fire concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Three types of concepts erupted and a Spear’s gleam shot out, striking the ring of flames.</p><p>With a loud boom, Lu Ming felt a boundless pressure surging toward him. His body trembled slightly and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing was in a similar situation. He took a few steps back.</p><p>In the sky, a burly middle-aged man in a red robe stood in the air. His eyes were cold as lightning as he scanned the three of them.</p><p>“Did you kill my son, Yun congsheng? Today, I’m going to bury all of you with me!”</p><p>The red-robed man’s cold voice rang out. As soon as he finished speaking, he pressed his hands down and a total of nine rings of fire shot towards Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Gu Huaxu.</p><p>&Nbsp; at the same time, the sacred beetle began to shake and fly toward the three of them.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field! Destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as he pushed out his palms. A powerful force field covered a radius of ten meters. Invisible cutting forces destroyed everything.</p><p>&Nbsp; this time, many of the sacred beetles were cut in half, leaving only three flame rings to charge through the force field.</p><p>“This is the destruction domain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Xie nianqing had actually comprehended the intent realm of destruction. At the same time, he had cultivated the intent realm of wind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
