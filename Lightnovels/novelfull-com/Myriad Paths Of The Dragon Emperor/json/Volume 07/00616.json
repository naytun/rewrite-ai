He started a massacre as soon as he came out. Look at how many people he has killed. Now, he wants to kill me!”</p><p>...</p><p>Seeing the arrival of the law enforcement Hall’s people, Yao Gu was ecstatic, as if he had found a life-saving straw, and he screamed madly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The burly man in red robes from the law enforcement Hall looked in the direction that Yao Gu was pointing at. His expression changed drastically when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>He had seen Lu Ming before. At this moment, he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Yao Gu did not notice the change in the red-robed man’s expression. He stepped back and looked at Lu Ming with a cold expression.</p><p>“Kid, who cares who you are? He must be punished for killing people in the myriad stars city!”</p><p>Yao Gu roared in his heart.</p><p>how dare you, Yao Gu! Kneel down and admit your guilt!</p><p>The red-robed man roared.</p><p>“Haha, brat, why aren’t you kneeling and admitting your guilt?”</p><p>Yao Gu laughed heartily, but his smile froze in the next moment. He realized that the red-robed man had actually called out his name.</p><p>He turned around stiffly and looked at the red-robed man. He smiled and said, ” “My Lord, you … Did you get the wrong name?”</p><p>“What do you mean by wrong name? I recognize you. You’re Yao Gu, right? I’m talking to you, why aren’t you kneeling!”</p><p>The red-robed man bellowed, and a powerful aura descended on Yao Gu.</p><p>Yao Gu, Zhuang Xiaoshan, and Zhuang xiaorou were all stunned.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was also stunned.</p><p>Wasn’t the one who killed him that young man? Now, how could he make Yao Gu kneel?</p><p>“Sir, Sir, is there a mistake? he’s the one who killed them!”</p><p>Yao Gu pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>“How dare you slander Lord Lu Ming? who is Lord Lu Ming? if you didn’t commit any Major Crimes, why would he kill you in a fit of anger? Kneel down!”</p><p>The red-robed man shouted.</p><p>“What … What? Lu … Lu Ming?”</p><p>Yao Gu’s face turned deathly pale. He looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>Then, his eyes were filled with endless fear.</p><p>The surroundings were completely silent.</p><p>Everyone widened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Could this young man be Lu Ming?</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s victory over the sacred constellation in the profound sky sub-Palace had spread throughout the eastern sub-Palace, and even the myriad stars city.</p><p>What kind of person was the sacred constellation? He was a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory, and his cultivation had reached the peak King realm.</p><p>It could be said that in the Tianxuan region, apart from the few sea of soul realm experts, no one could rival him.</p><p>Even such a person was defeated by Lu Ming. How powerful could Lu Ming be?</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was the strongest expert in the Tianxuan region. With his talent, he could even be on equal footing with sea of soul realm experts.</p><p>What kind of status was this?</p><p>Other people would definitely be punished for killing people in the myriad Star City, but Lu Ming would definitely not.</p><p>Who would dare to punish him?</p><p>When one’s power reached a certain level, they could override the rules.</p><p>“Brother, brother, he’s Lu Ming. He’s Lord Lu Ming. We’re saved!”</p><p>After Zhuang xiaorou’s shock, she was extremely excited.</p><p>The young man who had helped them was Lu Ming. They knew that they were saved. No one could touch them.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan said dumbly. He looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of endless admiration.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a few years older than him, but his achievements were a hundred and eight thousand times higher than his. He was his idol.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yao Gu’s body trembled like a sieve. Then, he actually knelt down.</p><p>When he found out that the young man in front of him was Lu Ming, he knew that he was finished.</p><p>But he didn’t want to give up, so he started to beg.”Lord Lu Ming, Lord Lu Ming, please spare me, spare me. The Zhuang siblings and I were just joking. We were just joking!”</p><p>“A joke?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”You think I’m blind? You probably thought that the two of them lost their support after their father passed away, right? It’s a pity that you don’t know that their father and I are best friends!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was not loud but it spread to the entire venue.</p><p>Life-and-death friends? Lu Ming and old Zhuang were actually life-and-death friends?</p><p>At this moment, countless people looked at Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou with envy.</p><p>Although old Zhuang was dead, the Zhuang siblings could do whatever they wanted in the Tianxuan region now that they had Lu Ming as their backer.</p><p>Yao Gu’s face was filled with despair.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flick of his finger, a ray of spear light shot out and pierced through Yao Gu’s dantian, scattering his cyclone.</p><p>His cultivation was completely crippled.</p><p>“All of you can leave first. I will handle this!”</p><p>Lu Ming told the people of the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The people from the Tribunal Council left respectfully.</p><p>As for Yao Gu and the rest, they had no eyes and offended Lu Ming. They would die in vain.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a stream of essential core wrapped around Yao Gu, bringing him to the Zhuang siblings.</p><p>“I’ll leave him to you guys. Kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Kill him?”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were shocked and hesitant.</p><p>“People of the martial path should repay kindness with kindness and hatred with hatred. If I hadn’t arrived just in time today, have you thought about your own fate? What’s there to hesitate about? if you still hesitate after killing your enemies, what’s the point of cultivating?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was like thunder, ringing in the Zhuang siblings ‘minds.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>“I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan struggled to get up.</p><p>“Brother, I’ll do it!”</p><p>A long sword appeared in Zhuang xiaorou’s hand.</p><p>no, spare my life. For the sake of my many years of friendship with your father, please spare my life!</p><p>Yao Gu cried out in fear.</p><p>“Just now, why didn’t you let us go on account of your many years of friendship with my father? die!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou’s voice was cold as she thrust her sword into Yao Gu’s heart.</p><p>Yao Gu’s eyes widened in disbelief. Finally, he stopped breathing.</p><p>He only wanted to bring Zhuang xiaorou back and play with her. He had done this many times and there had never been a problem. Why did he have to encounter Lu Ming this time?</p><p>Good and evil will always be rewarded. This was Yao Gu’s last thought.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, the strong preyed on the weak. If one’s heart wasn’t hard enough, how could one survive in this world?</p><p>Especially those who were extremely beautiful but had no strength. Their ending was usually very miserable and they would become other people’s playthings.</p><p>Lu Ming hoped that they would change after experiencing this.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, thank you for your help this time. Otherwise, Xiao Rou, she …”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou came to Lu Ming and thanked him.</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me. It’s my duty. Sigh, I didn’t have the strength to save your father back then!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The Zhuang siblings ‘eyes were red.</p><p>Old Zhuang’s storage ring appeared in his hand. He handed it to Zhuang Xiaoshan and said, this is your father’s storage ring. I’ll give it to you now! Picking up old Zhuang’s storage ring, the brother and sister’s eyes turned even redder, and tears flowed down.</p><p>Then, the brother and sister looked at each other and suddenly knelt down in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, please accept us as your disciples!”</p><p>The two of them said in unison.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
