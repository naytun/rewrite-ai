The two fist radiances shattered all of Lu Ming’s exploding star fist’s fist radiances, and the three-colored true dragon was also dispersed.</p><p>However, he still managed to block it for a moment. Just this one moment was enough.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands continuously. In an instant, dense runes appeared on his body.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming inscribed seven inscription arrays on himself.</p><p>Among them, there were inscription formations for Zhen Yuan explosion, inscription formations to increase speed, inscription formations to increase physical strength, inscription formations to increase defense …</p><p>With the inscription array, Lu Ming’s combat strength increased again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Below, Zhong Mo was unforgiving and his killing intent was like a tide.</p><p>“Little bastard, let’s see how you’re going to carve the inscription in the air!”</p><p>Zhong Mo sneered and his mountain-like fist radiance struck toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was impossible for an ordinary inscription master to inscribe a large inscription formation in the void. Only a rank 7 true inscription Alchemist could inscribe an inscription formation in the void and exert its effect.</p><p>This could only be done with a terrifyingly powerful spiritual power.</p><p>Lu Ming could not do it now. He was inscribing inscriptions in the void and the inscriptions would disappear very soon.</p><p>Back on the seven-colored Island, the seven-colored Daoist had once carved a large formation in the void, and his methods were unfathomable.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. He struck down with his spear. The huge Spear’s gleam was as big as a mountain and it pressed down on the space, causing it to tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming had added seven types of inscription arrays to this spear attack. Furthermore, he had used all his strength. Even an expert at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm would be crushed to death by this spear attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the fist force, and a huge force exploded.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed on the long spear. With the help of the recoil, Lu Ming’s body drifted backward, retreating thousands of meters in an instant.</p><p>He felt his qi and blood roiling in his body. Blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth, but he couldn’t care less. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, turned into a stream of light, and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Damn it, don’t run!”</p><p>Zhong Mo roared and chased after him.</p><p>However, the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was extremely fast, and with the help of the formation, his speed was even faster. It did not take long for him to leave Zhong Mo in the dust.</p><p>Lu Ming flew more than ten thousand miles in one breath and landed in a forest.</p><p>Then, he waved his hands and destroyed all the surveillance arrays in the forest.</p><p>After Lu Ming devoured some top-grade spirit crystals, he stood up immediately with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“This guy must die!”</p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He waved his hands and started to inscribe runes and arrays on the ground.</p><p>The inscriptions continued to sink into the ground. It took Lu Ming half an hour before he stopped.</p><p>kid, you’re really vicious. You carved thirty-six killing formations in one go and added an illusory formation to cover it up. Even if that guy is a third level spiritual ocean realm martial artist, once he steps in here, he will definitely die!</p><p>Dandan grinned.</p><p>“Isn’t this even more satisfying?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Cool, of course it’s cool. Kaka, let’s go and lure that guy here. I can’t wait to see him!”</p><p>Dandan sneered, her eyes shining.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and went back the way he came. He did not conceal his aura at all.</p><p>There were no surveillance runes in the air, so he was not afraid of being discovered by the underground humans.</p><p>After flying for a few thousand miles, a burly figure flew over at high speed. It was Zhong Mo, but his clothes were in a mess and he looked a little disheveled. It was obvious that he had encountered the underground humans along the way.</p><p>“Little bastard!”</p><p>Zhong Mo’s eyes turned red the moment he saw Lu Ming. He chased after Lu Ming with a murderous look.</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be shocked. He turned and ran.</p><p>Zhong Mo chased after him.</p><p>In the process of escaping, Lu Ming pretended to vomit blood again.</p><p>“Little bastard, you’re already injured. You can’t run away. Instead of dying in the hands of the underground people, I’d rather kill you!” Zhong Mo sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word. He ran with his head down. The two of them, one in front and one behind, soon crossed thousands of miles and arrived at the place where Lu Ming had set up the array. Lu Ming flew down and started running in the forest.</p><p>haha, you’re running out of true Qi, right? this time, you’re dead!</p><p>Overjoyed, Zhong Mo also descended and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, after running for a while, Lu Ming suddenly stopped and turned around. A strange smile appeared on his face as he looked at Zhong Mo. For some reason, when Zhong Mo saw Lu Ming’s smile, his heart suddenly tightened and he felt a little scared. He could not help but stop.</p><p>“Little bastard, why are you not running anymore? You know you can’t run now, right?”</p><p>Zhong Mo took a deep breath and shook off the inexplicable feeling. He sneered at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run? Why are you running? I’ll stay behind and send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>die! Zhong Mo shouted coldly as his true Yuan exploded, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly took a step forward. As he did so, dazzling inscriptions appeared where Zhong Mo was standing. The densely-packed inscriptions interweaved and were filled with a dazzling beauty.</p><p>However, Zhong Mo wasn’t in the mood to appreciate this beauty. His heart sank as he roared and rushed forward madly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a whooshing sound, a huge sword was formed and slashed at Zhong Mo with a terrifying aura.</p><p>Then, huge swords formed in all directions and slashed at Zhong Mo.</p><p>And this was only one formation. Following that, inscriptions kept flashing and thirty-six inscription formations were activated one after another with shocking power.</p><p>you little bastard! How dare you set up an inscription formation here? you’re despicable! Zhong Mo roared.</p><p>hahaha, I’m despicable. I’m an inscription master, and inscription Masters use inscriptions to fight. Also, you’re only at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, and you’re going against me, a peak King tier. You still have the face to call me despicable? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a few steps and countless inscriptions appeared.</p><p>All sorts of attacks erupted. Flames, storms, ice, swords, sabers …</p><p>All kinds of attacks instantly drowned Zhong Mo. In the formation, Zhong Mo roared repeatedly, but after a while, the roars disappeared, leaving only the sound of inscriptions raging.</p><p>A moment later, the formation fell silent and the light disappeared. Zhong Mo was no longer in the formation.</p><p>Zhong Mo had completely disappeared from this world. All that was left was a storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and the storage ring was absorbed into his hand.</p><p>Then, he turned around, rose into the air, and left the place.</p><p>His expression was calm. He knew that Zhong Mo was dead the moment he stepped into the formation.</p><p>The scariest thing about an inscriber was that they could set up a terrifying formation with enough time. If they had enough time and materials, it was even possible for them to kill an enemy one realm higher than them.</p><p>Of course, the formation you set up must first be undiscovered by the enemy, and the enemy must step into the formation to be useful.</p><p>Moreover, in a real battle, the enemy would not give you that much time to set up an array. In a real battle, an inscription master would rely on an inscription array that could be cast instantly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
