He did not expect that a martial skill would appear in his mind as soon as the prison-suppressing stele bloodline advanced to the ninth level of the king stage.</p><p>...</p><p>However, now was not the time to observe and comprehend the martial technique. There was still a part of blood essence in the nine Dragon bloodline that had not been refined.</p><p>The ninth chakra of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline had appeared. Lu Ming was not in a hurry to continue upgrading the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. Instead, he gave the remaining blood essence energy to the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>All in all, he had spent a day refining everyone’s blood essence. However, the nine Dragon bloodline had not been raised to the ninth level of the king tier. The energy was still not enough.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He got up and left the Supreme shrine, walking out of his room.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re too slow. It’s already been a day, and I can feel a strong aura of spirit herbs on the rainbow Island. There must be a large number of spirit herbs on the island. If we don’t go now, they’ll all be picked by others.”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming left the room, dandan, who was lying on Xie nianqing’s shoulder, screamed.</p><p>“A large amount of spiritual medicine?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He had too many uses for the spiritual medicine and would not let it go.</p><p>there’s definitely no mistake. There are definitely a lot of spirit herbs.</p><p>Dandan jumped onto Lu Ming’s shoulder, her eyes glowing.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll go over now!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing rose into the air and flew toward the rainbow Island.</p><p>The ten-thousand-mile distance was quickly covered.</p><p>Now, there were a lot fewer people around the seven colored Island. Many martial artists left when they saw that they couldn’t enter, but there were still a few who remained, hoping for a miracle.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s arrival did not attract much attention.</p><p>Now, the two of them had returned to their original appearances and removed their masks. No one knew that they were the famous Asura and Yaksha.</p><p>The island with a diameter of more than a hundred miles was floating in the air, covered by a light shield.</p><p>“This brother, why aren’t you guys going in?”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled a young man and asked curiously.</p><p>“Did you just come from outside? This place is protected by an inscription formation, and only those with the battle-power of a peak-tier King would be able to break through this barrier and enter.”</p><p>The young man cast a casual glance at Lu Ming and said casually. He was not too bothered.</p><p>Lu Ming looked five to six years younger than him. He did not think that Lu Ming would be able to barge in.</p><p>“Oh, so those peak-tier King tiers and above have all barged in? However, the rainbow Island only had a diameter of about a hundred miles. With so many experts entering, they should have already dug three feet deep into the rainbow Island. It’s been a day, why hasn’t he come out yet?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious. This was also something that he found strange.</p><p>“I don’t know. If you have the ability, go in and see for yourself.”</p><p>The young man looked at Lu Ming with a mocking expression.</p><p>However, Lu Ming nodded and said,”Yes, we can only go in and take a look.” &Nbsp;</p><p>Then, Lu Ming casually punched out and the light screen was penetrated. Lu Ming took a step and walked in.</p><p>Xie nianqing reached out his hand and pressed down. The light screen was also penetrated, and Xie nianqing’s figure disappeared.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The young man was dumbfounded and stood there in a daze.</p><p>The world spun and Lu Ming realized that he was in the air and was falling rapidly. He quickly circulated his vital essence to stay suspended in the air.</p><p>Xie nianqing appeared not far from him.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in mid-air, looking into the distance in a daze.</p><p>The world was vast with mountains and dangerous peaks. Lu Ming could see at least a few hundred miles away.</p><p>There was no end to the world.</p><p>It was more than a hundred miles, it was boundless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the seven-colored Island looks like it’s only a hundred miles from the outside, but there’s something else inside. I guess it’s a small plane with a huge area!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This Rainbow Island was really amazing.</p><p>Moreover, the mountains here were also very strange. They were divided into different colors and had distinct layers.</p><p>Some of the mountains had red plants, some had golden plants, some were blue, and some were purple …</p><p>There were a total of seven colors. No wonder it was called the rainbow Island.</p><p>Moreover, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth here was extremely rich.</p><p>there’s spirit herbs! I can smell spirit herbs!</p><p>Dandan raised her two short legs and ran forward wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing followed.</p><p>Dandan stopped on a mountain peak, only to see that the mountain peak was full of potholes, and there was still a residual medicinal fragrance. Obviously, there were indeed spiritual herbs, but they had been dug out.</p><p>They came to a few nearby mountain peaks, and there were traces of excavation everywhere.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist used to be a rank 7 true inscription master. He was probably an expert in alchemy, so it was normal for him to plant a lot of spirit herbs.</p><p>look, didn’t I say we were late? all the spiritual herbs have been dug up.</p><p>Dandan said unhappily.</p><p>let’s go, stop mumbling. This Island is very large, and no one has gone out yet. This means that this Island has not been completely mined. If we rush over now, we’ll still be in a hurry!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed dandan and placed her on his shoulder. He then transformed into a stream of light and sped forward.</p><p>They did not see anyone along the way, so Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not stop and continued flying.</p><p>Before long, the two of them had flown a distance of a hundred thousand miles. It was unknown how many mountains and rivers they had flown over.</p><p>Towards the end, the two of them saw the figure of a person, but it was already a corpse. It was obvious that a great battle had broken out as they were fighting over the spirit herbs.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a battle came from ahead.</p><p>Then, he saw a few streams of light flying toward a mountain range.</p><p>let’s go. We’ve found a level 6 spiritual herb in the valley ahead!</p><p>“Let’s join hands and snatch the spiritual medicine. We’ll split it evenly!”</p><p>The three figures disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the mountain range ahead, the rumbles were getting more and more intense.</p><p>“Level 6 spiritual medicine! Kill! Lu Ming, charge!”</p><p>When she heard about level six spirit herbs, dandan’s eyes lit up and her little claws kept waving.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Level 6 spiritual herbs were rare.</p><p>Together with Xie nianqing, they flew forward.</p><p>In front of him, there was a huge Canyon in the mountains. Inside, there were flashes of light and violent rumbles, as well as the angry roars of people.</p><p>The two of them rushed in without hesitation.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people fighting, and they were all peak-tier King tiers. On a cliff in the valley, there were three purple spirit herbs.</p><p>Ziying grass was a level 6 spiritual herb. After consuming it, it could increase one’s true essence and increase one’s cultivation.</p><p>More than a dozen peak-tier Kings were engaged in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and walked toward the Ziying grass.</p><p>“Brat, get lost. The Ziying grass is mine.”</p><p>One of the burly men’s eyes flickered with a menacing glint and he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his hand around and threw a punch. An explosive fist radiance shot out. The strong man’s claw made a cracking sound and his bones broke. He screamed in pain and his body flew out like a cannonball. He crashed heavily into the stone wall at the side of the canyon, creating a huge pit.</p><p>The brawny man was stuck in the deep pit. He was already exhaling more than he was inhaling.</p><p>The dozen peak-tier Kings who were fighting instantly stopped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
