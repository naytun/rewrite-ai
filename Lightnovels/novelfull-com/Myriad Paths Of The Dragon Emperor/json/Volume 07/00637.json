Its attack power was extremely terrifying. It could destroy everything. In terms of attack power, even the Thunder mentality was a lot weaker.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing had also comprehended the wind mentality. However, the two mentalities were obviously not combined.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>At this moment, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He had not used the infinite Dragon Spear since he got it.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear turned into a series of shadows. Dozens of spear lights burst out. As the spear lights were too sharp, they tore through the air and created dozens of vacuum passages.</p><p>&Nbsp; the spear radiance struck dozens of sacred beetles, causing them to explode.</p><p>The tip of the infinite Dragon Spear was made of indestructible steel. It was extremely hard and sharp, and it could easily break through the sacred beetle’s defense.</p><p>On the other side, Gu Huaxu let out a long howl and his dark green sword Qi exploded. It was also stronger than before and split apart the sacred beetles.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, there was a violent explosion. Lu Ming and the rest collided with the ring of flames, creating a shocking explosion. The entire mountain shook violently.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The red-robed middle-aged man’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of three was too powerful. Not only could they break through the sacred beetle, but they could also block his attack. They were only martial Kings, but they were so terrifying.</p><p>raging flames billow to the heavens! Slash the world!</p><p>The red-robed man waved his hands and pressed down.</p><p>Immediately, dozens of rings of fire formed and shot toward the three of them.</p><p>This kind of fiery disc was the combination of the red-robed man’s vital essence and will. It was extremely powerful, and the edge of the ring was extremely sharp. It also carried the explosive intent of fire. If someone was hit by it, they would definitely explode.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about the three of us join forces?”</p><p>Gu Huaxu suddenly shouted.</p><p>His opponent was a sea of soul realm expert. No matter if it was Zhen Yuan or intent, they were both too strong. They couldn’t be his opponent alone. If they wanted to leave this place safely, they had to work together.</p><p>Otherwise, they would only be defeated one by one.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very clear about this. He nodded and agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Regardless of whether Gu Huaxu was possessed or not, he had to get through this first.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s body flashed and he appeared beside Lu Ming and the rest like a ghost.</p><p>in the spiritual ocean tier, the dantian turns into the sea, and the Zhen Yuan is too rich. We can’t fight him head-on, or our Zhen Yuan will definitely be exhausted in advance. The other party is a martial artist at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, so we can only change from passive to active and counterattack to have a chance of winning!</p><p>Gu Huaxu analyzed.</p><p>“What method do you have?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>It was very likely that Gu Huaxu had been possessed by a spirit God. He might really have a way.</p><p>The few of them blocked the red-robed man’s attacks while conversing through voice transmission.</p><p>“The two of us will open up a path and attack the other party. Let this little girl use her force field to cover the other party and reduce his speed. Only then will we have a chance of winning!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s lead the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, he activated his second blood Meridian and his power increased.</p><p>An extreme strike!</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his strongest attack. He became one with the spear and turned into a ray of spear radiance. It pierced through the void and rushed up into the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few rings were destroyed by Lu Ming and the sharp Spear’s gleam was pointed at the burly man in red robes!</p><p>Sky poison sword!</p><p>A dark green light flashed in Gu Huaxu’s eyes. Even the short sword in his hand turned dark green. With a slash, a few rings were broken and the dark green sword light slashed towards the red-robed man.</p><p>The red-robed man’s eyes turned serious. He clenched his fists in the air and the Rings of flames flew back. They turned into two rings that emitted a powerful aura and shot toward Lu Ming’s spear radiance and dark green sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two earth-shaking explosions were heard as violent Qi spread out. Two pillars of Qi shot up into the sky from where the three were fighting.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The stone wall above the cave was directly penetrated, and the whole mountain shook violently.</p><p>Countless boulders came crashing down, but when they were still several dozen meters from the four, they were shattered by the energy from their bodies.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing turned into two streaks of light and rushed up. On the other side, Gu Huaxu did the same.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The red-robed man let out an earth-shattering roar and turned into a sea of fire, blasting towards the three of them.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his little hand and the sky demon force field acted on the red-robed man, blocking his figure for a moment. In this way, Lu Ming and the other two rushed out of the mountain peak.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The burly man in red robe bellowed. The next moment, the sky demon force field was shattered. He turned into a flame and broke through the sky in an instant. With a wave of his hand, dozens of rings of flame were blasted toward Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two retaliated. With a loud bang, the sky exploded like fireworks.</p><p>As for the mountain peak below, it had completely collapsed.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared. The spirit herbs he wanted were still inside.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Something has happened in the forbidden area!”</p><p>Such a huge commotion naturally alarmed the entire Cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. Countless people were flying around in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More than twenty figures were flying toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Forefather, what happened?”</p><p>“Forefather, what’s going on?”</p><p>These people asked one after another.</p><p>“These people have trespassed the forbidden area. All of you, attack and take them down!”</p><p>The red-robed man ordered.</p><p>“What? How dare you!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The twenty-odd people shouted one after another. Their powerful auras exploded and surrounded Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Every one of them was a late-stage King, and they were the strongest force in the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>The red-robed man instructed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Over twenty late-stage King tiers attacked together. All sorts of techniques and lights were unleashed toward the three of them.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>As for the red-robed man, he waved his hand and everyone’s attacks were directed towards Gu Huaxu.</p><p>He wanted to break them one by one.</p><p>Just now, his attacks were too scattered. That was why Lu Ming and the rest managed to block them. Now, he was going to focus on one person.</p><p>Gu Huaxu was shocked, and he quickly retreated as a dark green sword Qi burst out.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The red-robed man pressed down with his hand and a Ring of Fire spun rapidly, colliding with the sword Qi. The sword Qi only resisted for a breath before it collapsed. The ring did not stop and continued forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s body trembled as his short sword struck the ring, and he quickly retreated.</p><p>no, I’m not his match alone. We have to work together!</p><p>Gu Huaxu charged at Lu Ming without a care.</p><p>But the red-robed man stopped him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
