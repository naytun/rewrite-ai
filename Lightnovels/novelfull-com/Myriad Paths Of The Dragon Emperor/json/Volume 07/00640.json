Moreover, the people in the cloud Sea alchemy institution made use of the brutal method of the baby’s innate blood Qi to refine pills and make a profit. Naturally, they earned more Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Normal peak-tier Kings and late-stage Kings weren’t this rich.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that Yun Luo’s storage ring definitely had more top-grade spiritual crystals. It was a pity that he had escaped.</p><p>“It’s more than enough to break through to the peak-tier King level!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing after he was done sorting out the best-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>At this moment, an invisible force field emanated from Xie nianqing’s body, covering a radius of a hundred meters. It trembled continuously and shrank.</p><p>Xie nianqing held the heavenly demon fruit in his hand. The fruit glowed and wisps of light were absorbed by Xie nianqing.</p><p>It seemed that Xie nianqing’s cultivation would not end anytime soon.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s body disappeared and he entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>The next breakthrough would cause a huge commotion. If they were outside, Xie nianqing would most likely be alerted.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a large pile of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared. There were a total of one million pieces.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>All one million Supreme spiritual crystals exploded and turned into extremely rich spiritual Qi.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline emerged. After reaching the eighth level of the king level, the nine Dragon bloodline’s body seemed to have become larger. Its body was winding, and its scales were dense. It was becoming more and more like the legendary true dragon.</p><p>He opened his mouth and inhaled. A terrifying devouring power burst forth. The energy of a million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals was swarmed into the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and began cultivating.</p><p>Breaking through to peak-tier King tier required an abnormally large amount of energy, and he had to condense his Qi vortex to the extreme in preparation for breaking through to the spirit sea realm.</p><p>Therefore, he needed a lot of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>The devouring and refining power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline had increased several times. It did not take long for him to refine one million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals. Lu Ming took out another one million.</p><p>Just like that, one million followed another.</p><p>Endless energy was being accumulated.</p><p>After Lu Ming had refined 18 million pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, the Qi cyclone in his dantian finally reached an extremely condensed stage. It was like a liquid that was spinning, like the Eye of the Sea.</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura rose from Lu Ming’s body. He had broken through to a peak-tier King.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Circulating the true war Dragon technique, his essential core surged and flowed. Lu Ming felt that the strength of his essential core was several times stronger than before. Naturally, Lu Ming’s combat strength had also increased by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p>Peak-tier Kings were considered to be standing at the peak of King tiers. The next step would be to open the spirit sea and step into the spirit sea realm.</p><p>However, this step wasn’t that easy.</p><p>First of all, one had to comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth to the second level. Without the second level intent realm of heaven and earth, trying to break through to the sea of soul realm would only lead to death.</p><p>it has only been a day since I refined so many top-grade spirit crystals. Let’s go and see how little Qing’s cultivation is going!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, he felt a powerful force field surging and his body was under immense pressure. Lu Ming moved and retreated a few hundred meters before the pressure disappeared.</p><p>The demonic fruit in Xie nianqing’s hand had disappeared. Her long hair was flying in the air, and a lotus flower was floating above her head. A beautiful woman was sitting cross-legged on the lotus flower.</p><p>A powerful force field emanated from Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>“It’s not simple, it’s not simple!”</p><p>Dandan circled around Xie nianqing, her eyes darting around as she carefully sized up Xie nianqing.</p><p>Eight hours later, the force field around him suddenly shrunk and disappeared into Xie nianqing’s body. At this time, Xie nianqing opened his eyes.</p><p>“Little Qing, how is it? Did you break through the sky demon power field?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and smiled.</p><p>“Of course I did. How was it? You want to test its power?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curved into a sly smile. He stared at Lu Ming with ill intentions.</p><p>“You think you can defeat me just because you’ve broken through? then you’ll be disappointed again!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled confidently.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then I’ll have to try!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled. As soon as she finished speaking, she pressed her palms forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An extremely powerful force field burst forth and enveloped Lu Ming in an instant. It was as if a majestic mountain was pressing down on him.</p><p>so strong! He’s several times stronger than before!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a hint of surprise.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, a powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. He circulated his essential core and gathered three types of heaven and earth intent realms, opening up the power of the demonic power field.</p><p>“You’ve made a breakthrough in your cultivation?”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>of course! You’ve already broken through, so how can I not? ”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Just in time, destruction cut!”</p><p>cut! Xie nianqing shouted and pressed his palms together. A terrifying cutting force burst out from the sky demon power field. This cutting force was formed by the will of destruction and the sky demon power field. It was so sharp that even a fifth-level spiritual weapon would be cut apart.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, a long spear was condensed from vital essence. With the tip of the spear as the center, the long spear spun rapidly like a drill bit and drilled in Xie nianqing’s direction.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a loud boom, the domain in front of him was broken. Lu Ming stepped forward and dodged Xie nianqing’s attack.</p><p>If he wanted to defeat Xie nianqing, the first thing he had to do was to rush out of the domain and attack Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, I’m going to reward you after I take you down!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>“You want to take me down? dream on!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as her Blood Meridian burst out. Her delicate hand pressed down again.</p><p>A beautiful arm formed out of thin air and slapped at Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying palm force swept toward Lu Ming like a stormy sea.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not dare to be careless. He thrust his spear forward and a huge three-colored true dragon pounced out, colliding with the beautiful palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled terrifyingly, and the terrain rose and fell. Violent energy swept in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took three steps back.</p><p>Xie nianqing also took three steps back.</p><p>They were equally matched.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. Just as he was about to activate his Blood Meridian to fight Xie nianqing, Xie nianqing retracted his demonic force field and said, ” “No more fighting, no more fighting, today is considered a draw!”</p><p>“You’re not fighting?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Other things aside, Xie nianqing was a good opponent. Lu Ming was about to activate his Blood Meridian and fight with all his might, but Xie nianqing stopped.</p><p>Hmph, you’re a man, yet you’re fighting with a little girl. And you’re so serious. How petty. Who wants to fight with you? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curled into a smile as he looked at Lu Ming in disdain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
