Is this old man the spiritual Turtle Master of Golden Turtle Island? ”</p><p>that’s him. I didn’t expect him to be on golden sand island. No wonder he’s so strong.</p><p>master spiritual turtle has been in closed-door cultivation for many years. His combat strength is unfathomable. I wonder who will challenge him next!</p><p>Waves of discussions could be heard in the surroundings.</p><p>“This spiritual turtle Sage is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He could tell that the spiritual turtle Lord’s sudden burst of power was a secret technique that could increase his battle-power, which was quite good for peak-tier Kings.</p><p>“Not bad? Hehe, what big words, you sound like you’re very strong.”</p><p>On the side, Chen Zhao showed a contemptuous smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Was this guy crazy? wasn’t it just that he did not take action that time? After that, she targeted him in every way.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored such a narrow-minded person and did not even look at Chen Zhao.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had ignored him, Chen Zhao’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Master spiritual turtle looked around, and for a moment, no one spoke.</p><p>“Hehe, it seems like no one is going to fight?”</p><p>Master spiritual turtle sneered.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Chen Zhao’s elder brother stood up beside him, and a powerful aura emanated from him.</p><p>Chen Zhao’s big brother was called Chen Dao.</p><p>Chen Dao took a step forward and appeared on the life battle platform.</p><p>it’s Chen Dao. Chen Dao is going to fight. It’s going to be interesting.</p><p>Chen Dao has won seven times in a row. He’s extremely powerful and is one of the generals of the flame Chamber of Commerce. If he fights master spiritual turtle, haha, it must be intense.</p><p>Chen Dao’s appearance made many people excited.</p><p>“Big brother has made his move!”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s eyes lit up. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, let’s wait and see. Let’s see how strong my big brother is. Let’s see how strong a peak-tier King can be.”</p><p>However, he realized that Lu Ming had ignored him again. This made him rather depressed.</p><p>young man, you have guts. You dare to challenge me? ”</p><p>Master spiritual turtle looked at Chen Dao and said coldly.</p><p>“Are you going to fight or surrender?”</p><p>Chen Dao’s reply was simple but full of confidence.</p><p>what big words. I’ve been in seclusion for decades. The youngsters nowadays are getting more and more arrogant. Let me teach you how to respect your elders!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed toward Chen Dao as fast as lightning. At the same time, a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>It was that kind of secret technique.</p><p>Although the spiritual turtle was arrogant and confident, it used its full strength when it attacked. It did not dare to underestimate its opponent.</p><p>Knowing his reputation and still daring to challenge him, how could he be a weakling? He had lived for hundreds of years, and he was very clear about this.</p><p>A powerful fist force was sent towards Chen Dao.</p><p>However, Chen Dao didn’t move at all. When the fist force of the spiritual turtle Sage approached, his eyes suddenly lit up. He moved.</p><p>When he moved, it meant that he had drawn his saber.</p><p>A bright blade light lit up, as if it had cut the space in half.</p><p>Lord Spiritual turtle’s fist force was also split in half. He was shocked and retreated frantically to avoid the blade.</p><p>But Chen Dao’s attack had just begun.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Chen Dao shouted with astonishing momentum. The pale Saber Light lit up again, stronger and sharper than the previous one. It instantly broke through the void and slashed toward master spiritual turtle.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lord Spiritual turtle was shocked. He waved his fists and a thick turtle shell formed in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blade light hit the turtle shell, causing it to shake violently and crack. Before Lord spirit turtle could even take a breath, Chen Dao had already made the third strike, followed by the fourth, and the fifth …</p><p>Saber after saber, each stronger than the last, slashed at Lord Spiritual turtle without end.</p><p>When he made the seventh cut, his turtle shell exploded and the saber Light flashed.</p><p>Immediately, Chen Dao retracted his blade.</p><p>Lord Spiritual turtle’s eyes widened. A line of blood appeared between his eyebrows and extended downward. Plop! Lord Spiritual turtle fell down and was cut in half.</p><p>Master spiritual turtle was dead.</p><p>Deafening cheers came from the crowd. Chen Dao had killed the spiritual turtle Sage and advanced to eight consecutive wins.</p><p>It was rare to see someone win eight matches in a row.</p><p>This meant that eight peak-tier Kings had died at Chen Dao’s hands.</p><p>“Hehe, did you see that? this is my big brother’s strength.”</p><p>Chen Zhao glanced at Lu Ming smugly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>He did think that Chen Dao was not bad. Chen Dao’s battle power was probably close to the Holy star.</p><p>Of course, Chen Dao was already over 30 years old, which was 10 years older than sacred constellation. He had spent 10 more years on martial techniques, intent, and physical body. In terms of potential, he could not be compared to sacred constellation.</p><p>The list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory selected young people under 30 years old. It not only looked at cultivation, but also talent, ability to fight above one’s level, and potential.</p><p>Some powerful forces had abundant resources and could produce a group of young peak-tier King tiers, but these people couldn’t make it to the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“You’re really boasting. How many peak-tier Kings can match my big brother’s battle-power?”</p><p>Chen Zhao sneered.</p><p>“Frog in the well!” It was Xie nianqing who spoke.</p><p>“You … What did he say?”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s face turned red.</p><p>“Someone is going up to challenge him!”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored Chen Zhao and looked at the fighting ring.</p><p>Chen Zhao also looked over.</p><p>A young man in a blood-red robe stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>This young man was about twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. He had a cold expression and a faint sneer hung on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Hmph, he really doesn’t know his own strength. He dares to challenge my big brother. He’s just courting death.</p><p>Chen Zhao laughed sarcastically.</p><p>However, Chen Dao, who was on the fighting ring, looked serious.</p><p>The other party was just standing there casually, but he made him feel as if he was facing a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. He was under great pressure.</p><p>Furthermore, the other party was so young, not even thirty years old, yet he dared to step onto the stage. He was definitely not simple.</p><p>“How should I address you?”</p><p>Chen Dao asked.</p><p>“Blood gang!”</p><p>The young man’s face darkened.</p><p>“Xuegang?”</p><p>Chen Dao muttered to himself for a while and then let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>He had thought that his opponent might be a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. If he really was on the list, he would have to consider whether to fight or not.</p><p>However, Gang Xue’s name wasn’t on the list of top 1000 talents. Obviously, he wasn’t a sovereign on the list.</p><p>“Fight or surrender!”</p><p>Xue gang’s gloomy voice sounded.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Chen Dao replied firmly.</p><p>“Hehe, good, I was really afraid that you would surrender.”</p><p>Xue gang licked his lips, and his expression became even colder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, blood Qi shot up into the sky from Xue gang’s body. A huge blood-red palm floated above his head with seven silver chakras revolving around it.</p><p>King level seventh rank bloodline!</p><p>Chen Dao’s face changed.</p><p>Those with second bloodlines who could reach the seventh level of the king level were absolute geniuses.</p><p>For example, Qin Qingshan and the Holy star were both seventh level Kings.</p><p>A battle blade was floating above Chen Dao’s head. It was only a sixth level king class bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
