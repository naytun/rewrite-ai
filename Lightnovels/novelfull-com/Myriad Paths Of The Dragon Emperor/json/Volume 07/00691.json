I believe that the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure will soon spread throughout the exposed starry sea.”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“No, brat, if you dare, I will kill you. I promise …”</p><p>The blood poison sect’s sect master roared in anger. However, at this moment, Lu Ming stopped the infusion of essential Qi and his voice disappeared.</p><p>“I really want to see the expressions of the blood poison sect’s people.”</p><p>Jian feiliu laughed. He felt very comfortable.</p><p>“Their expressions will definitely be very interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Indeed, the expressions of the blood poison sect’s people were truly fascinating.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, that bastard, the next time I see him, I’ll skin him alive!”</p><p>The burly man roared continuously. His eyes were wide open as if they were about to spew fire.</p><p>everything was planned, but I didn’t expect that guy to have two Jade swords. Damn it!</p><p>The weak woman gritted her teeth and her eyes were filled with hatred.</p><p>The others were the same. Their faces were ashen, and the veins on their faces were twitching. The feeling of having nowhere to vent their anger was too uncomfortable.</p><p>They were so angry that they almost vomited blood. They were just one step away from success, but they had failed at the last step.</p><p>“The next time I meet him, he’ll definitely die!”</p><p>The sect master of the xue du sect gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Sect master, what do we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>there are nine keys. We can’t open the Martial Emperor’s treasure without one. We can only wait!</p><p>The sect master said helplessly.</p><p>……</p><p>One day later, Jian feiliu’s injuries were healed. They went to the wind Moon Island together.</p><p>The wind Moon Island was twice as large as the Golden sand island. It was very prosperous and had a lot of people. It was said that there were even experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier here.</p><p>After the three of them entered the city, they bought a lot of paper and wrote down the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure as well as the specific address on the paper. At night, they scattered the paper everywhere.</p><p>As expected, the entire wind Moon Island was in an uproar the next day.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two had scattered too many pieces of paper. They could not hide it even if they wanted to. Very quickly, the news spread throughout the wind Moon Island and countless people were discussing this topic.</p><p>In a restaurant, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Jian feiliu were eating and drinking while listening to the news from nearby.</p><p>you should have heard the news about the Martial Emperor’s treasure, right? ”</p><p>Nearby, the voices of the other tables could be heard.</p><p>of course I did. Now, everyone on the wind Moon Island knows about it, but we don’t know if the Martial Emperor’s treasure is real or fake. If it’s real, why would someone spread the news everywhere? could it be a prank? ”</p><p>I don’t know. A Martial Emperor’s treasure. There are so many martial emperors in the entire East continent. Is there really a Martial Emperor’s treasure? It’s a little mysterious.”</p><p>“No matter what? The Martial Emperor’s treasure is too amazing. Even if there’s only a one in a million chance that it’s real, I still want to take a look. If it’s real, I’ll benefit endlessly as long as I can get even a little bit of benefit from it!”</p><p>that’s right. I’m only afraid that it’s real. I’m not afraid that it’s fake.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two looked at each other and smiled when they heard the voices nearby.</p><p>With such a wide spread, many people would doubt the authenticity of the news. However, the Martial Emperor’s treasure was too amazing and tempting. Even if they suspected it was fake, most people couldn’t resist the temptation and would go to take a look.</p><p>This was the effect they wanted.</p><p>In the next few days, the news spread further and further. Some people had even set off.</p><p>As for Lu Ming and the other two, they hid in the wind Moon Island and cultivated with all their might.</p><p>If it was really a Martial Emperor’s treasure, there would definitely be a fierce fight after it was opened. Therefore, the more powerful they were, the better.</p><p>In a mountain range, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were fighting with all their might. Now that Xie nianqing had successfully fused two intents, his main task was to help Lu Ming fuse Earth Force and the other three intents.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>After seven days of bitter cultivation, Lu Ming had finally successfully integrated the force of the earth into the three concepts.</p><p>Three intents and one force had been successfully fused.</p><p>In a hotel room, Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and sat cross-legged. In front of him was a pile of profound meaning crystals and twenty-two middle-grade fire-type profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the esoteric crystals to start breaking through to the second level of the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>If his intent could break through to the second level, his combat strength would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>He picked up a piece of ultimacy crystal and crushed it. Next to the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming began to cultivate. Not long after, Lu Ming crushed another mid-grade fire-attribute ultimacy crystal.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming crushed the pieces one by one. He stopped after crushing a total of twelve pieces.</p><p>“Just a little bit more, but just that little bit. I just can’t break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Now, his fire concept was only a little bit away from level two. It was not even half a step away, but it was stuck and couldn’t be broken.</p><p>it seems like the second level intent realm of heaven and earth is indeed different from the first level. It can’t be continuously improved just by relying on profound meaning crystals. It also needs comprehension. Only by using comprehension to break through the bottleneck and then combining it with the profound meaning crystals can it continuously improve!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>It was obvious that he had reached a bottleneck in his fire attribute concept.</p><p>Lu Ming did not continue to attack the fire element concept. Instead, he took out a middle-grade wind element profound meaning crystal and started to attack the wind concept.</p><p>Just like the fire intent, after refining a dozen middle-grade wind element intent crystals, his wind intent had also reached the peak of the first level. It was only a bit away from the second level, but it was still stuck.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled bitterly. It was very difficult to break through to the second level of the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>No wonder there were so many peak-tier King tiers, but there were so few spiritual ocean tier ones.</p><p>Take Tianxuan region’s Tianxuan sub-Palace as an example. There were at least fifty or more peak-tier Kings among all the elders, traveling elders, and elders in seclusion.</p><p>But as for spiritual ocean tier, there were only two-the Sheng family’s head, Sheng Cang, and mu Tian.</p><p>The same was true for golden sand island. They had sent over five hundred peak-tier King tiers to battle the sea beasts, and some of them had even died on the life battle platform. However, how many sea of soul realm experts did they have?</p><p>As long as one’s talent wasn’t bad, and with the accumulation of resources, it wasn’t hard to reach peak-tier King tier with the passage of time.</p><p>Some people could become peak-tier Kings after cultivating for a few hundred years.</p><p>However, many people would be stuck at the peak-tier King level, unable to break through in their entire lives.</p><p>One could only imagine how difficult it was to break through the Spirit sea.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stopped cultivating.</p><p>It was almost time for them to set off.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Jian feiliu flew toward the island where the Martial Emperor’s treasure was.</p><p>A few days later, they arrived at the island.</p><p>There was a sea of people, a real sea of people.</p><p>They were densely packed. At a glance, they were all human figures.</p><p>There were at least hundreds of thousands of them, maybe even close to a million.</p><p>These are the people from the nearby seas of the chaotic Astral Ocean. The people from the other seas have yet to arrive.</p><p>The three of them squeezed through the crowd.</p><p>He really had to squeeze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
