In the past, manager Yan would come out to welcome us attentively before we even landed. Why is there no one here today?” Chen Zhao said with a frown.</p><p>...</p><p>Luo Xin also frowned and her face suddenly changed, ” “Not good, there’s a problem. Let’s leave quickly!”</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Clearly, some of the more experienced people had also thought of something and called out.</p><p>hahaha, it’s too late to leave now. You can all stay!</p><p>A sneer was heard. Then, the sound of the air being torn could be heard. Figures appeared from all directions of the square. There were more than a thousand people, standing in the air and surrounding the flame caravan.</p><p>“Pirates, it’s Pirates!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The faces of Luo Xin and the others also darkened.</p><p>In the chaotic Astral Ocean, Pirates are the most terrifying.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Ocean was originally a gathering place for some fiends. Those fiends in the eastern wastelands who could no longer survive would go to the chaotic Astral Ocean, and no one would be able to find them.</p><p>The chaotic Astral ocean’s Pirates are even fiercer than the fiercest ones. They specifically kill passing merchant teams and seize their cultivation resources. Their methods are extremely ruthless and they leave no survivors.</p><p>There were even some Pirates who cultivated evil cultivation techniques that required slaughter, blood, and even the souls of Warriors to cultivate.</p><p>everyone, we’re from the flame Chamber of Commerce. I hope you can give us some face. I understand the rules. I’ll give you 1000000 Supreme spiritual crystals in exchange for us leaving. How about it? ”</p><p>Luo Xin flew out and wanted to discuss with the other party.</p><p>The flame Chamber of Commerce is considered a huge Chamber of Commerce in the chaotic Astral Ocean. It is quite powerful and famous. Some Pirates will give some face to it when they hear about it.</p><p>Unfortunately, Luo Xin was wrong.</p><p>From the other side, a burly man with a knife scar on his face flew out. His eyes scanned Luo Xin’s curvaceous body with a fiery gaze and sneered, ” do you think you can dismiss us with just one million Supreme spiritual crystals? do you think we are beggars? ”</p><p>how about this, you can keep half of all the goods you have this time. Also, you can serve me for a night. If I’m satisfied with your service, I can consider letting you leave.</p><p>After saying that, the knife-scarred man licked his lips, and his eyes were full of lust.</p><p>Luo Xin’s face turned pale.</p><p>you’re dreaming. Don’t think that you can defeat us. You only have a thousand people, and we have more people than you. If we really fight, it’s not certain who will win.</p><p>Chen Zhao shouted, his anger soaring.</p><p>“Hahaha, so what if you have more people than us? In my eyes, they’re all sheep waiting to be slaughtered. Kid, let me tell you, our Blood Fiend Pirates never rely on numbers to win!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man laughed contemptuously.</p><p>“What? You’re from the blood Fiend Pirates?”</p><p>Luo Xin, Chen Zhao, and countless people at the scene had a drastic change in their expressions. Their faces were filled with fear.</p><p>It seemed that the Bloodfiend Pirates were very famous.</p><p>hehe, looks like you’ve heard of the blood Fiend Pirates before. You should know that we’ve always been ruthless. Today, I’m in a good mood, so I’ll let you go. As long as you serve me well and leave me half of your goods, I’ll let you go!</p><p>The knife-scarred man sneered.</p><p>Chen Zhao’s expression kept changing, but he did not continue speaking.</p><p>don’t even think about it, miss. I’ll do my best to escort you out later. You can’t trust the blood Fiend Pirates. Even if we agree to their conditions, they’ll go back on their word!</p><p>An old man walked out from behind Luo Xin, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>This elder was a peak-tier King.</p><p>“Old man, you want to send her out by yourself? stop dreaming!”</p><p>The man with the knife scar sneered, and a powerful aura spread out from his body.</p><p>Peak-tier King! This burly man was actually a peak-tier King as well! Not only that, but another powerful aura also rose up behind the knife-scarred burly man. He was also a peak-tier King.</p><p>The blood Fiend Pirates had sent out two peak-tier Kings.</p><p>Everyone’s heart sank.</p><p>There was only one peak-tier King in the flame caravan, and he usually didn’t attack just in case.</p><p>Ordinary pirate groups rarely have peak King Warriors, but the blood Fiend pirate group is an extremely powerful pirate group in the chaotic Astral Ocean. It’s normal for them to have peak King Warriors, but he didn’t expect two to come at once.</p><p>“I gave you a chance, but you didn’t want it. Now you have no chance!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s eyes flickered with a fierce and bloodthirsty light, and the aura on his body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Kill! Cripple the young women’s cultivation and leave them behind. Kill the rest!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood Fiend Pirates roared, their murderous auras filling the air.</p><p>From their auras, everyone in the Bloodfiend Pirates was covered in blood and had been through many battles.</p><p>This kind of person had rich fighting experience. Ordinary martial artists would even feel uneasy and their combat strength would be weakened if they were suppressed by the other party’s baleful Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>A series of voices roared as they rushed towards the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“Chen Zhao, take the young lady and break out of the encirclement. I’ll block them!”</p><p>The peak-tier King of the flame Chamber of Commerce roared and rushed toward the man with the scar.</p><p>“Old man, go to hell!”</p><p>The scar-faced man’s eyes were extremely cold. With a blood-red saber in his hand, he slashed out, and a mighty Blood River gushed toward the old man of the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“Star Breaker sword!”</p><p>The old man from the flame Chamber of Commerce thrust his sword forward. Specks of Starlight filled the air as he charged at his opponent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, his body trembled and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>With one move, he fell to the ground.</p><p>Luo Xin and the others were even more desperate.</p><p>you want to stop me with this little combat strength? you’re really looking for death!</p><p>The knife-scarred man sneered.</p><p>“Go, you guys hurry up and leave!”</p><p>The old man shouted at Luo Xin and the others.</p><p>“Hehe, go, where to?”</p><p>A sneer was heard and a figure as tall as a bamboo pole appeared in front of Luo Xin. The aura on his body was unfathomable.</p><p>This person was the other peak-tier King of the blood Fiend Pirates.</p><p>Luo Xin, Chen Zhao, and the others ‘faces were as white as paper, and their hearts were like dead ashes.</p><p>‘Ah … Ah …’</p><p>At this moment, screams could be heard from all directions. The blood Fiend Pirates had the upper hand. People from the flame Chamber of Commerce were being killed.</p><p>“Fifth brother, this little girl is really not bad. After you play with her, you have to let me play with her!”</p><p>The skinny man looked at Luo Xin, his eyes flashing with a fiery light.</p><p>“Alright, sixth brother, since you’ve taken a fancy to it, of course you can!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man sneered.</p><p>Luo Xin’s body began to tremble.</p><p>damn it, damn it! If my big brother was here, he would definitely be able to kill them easily!</p><p>Chen Zhao let out a low roar.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Then, the knife-scarred man slashed at the old man again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The old man’s body was pushed back again, and blood flowed out of his mouth.</p><p>Among peak-tier King tiers, there was a huge difference in battle prowess. Clearly, the knife-scarred man was stronger than the old man.</p><p>“Old man, I’ll kill you with three more slashes!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man sneered.</p><p>“You have no chance!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice was heard.</p><p>Two young men, one male and one female, suddenly appeared behind the elder.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
