His movements immediately became as slow as a snail.</p><p>...</p><p>grumble, I can’t even eat a meal in peace. So annoying!</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>Gu Feng’s face revealed a terrified expression. He wanted to turn his head, but with a bang, he turned into a pool of blood mist.</p><p>Yes, under the terrifying force field, he was turned into a pool of blood. There was nothing left of him except for his storage ring, which was caught by Xie nianqing.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant were shocked.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s methods were truly evil. He didn’t even move and turned Gu Feng into a cloud of blood mist. It was simply terrifying and made people’s scalps tingle.</p><p>As for the two burly men with Gu Feng, their faces turned pale, without a trace of blood.</p><p>“You … You killed lone wind, our leader will not let you go. Our leader is a peak King!”</p><p>One of them said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Oh, so this battle is inevitable?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No… Not bad.”</p><p>The burly man replied.</p><p>“Alright, then you guys stand here first and wait for us to finish eating!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He picked up his glass and took a sip.</p><p>Xie nianqing was the same, but her face was a little cold.</p><p>The two burly men stood there. They wanted to leave but did not dare to. They could only look at each other and stand there, not knowing what Lu Ming was up to.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu Ming finished his meal and stood up. He said to the waiter, ” “Little brother, you can go!”</p><p>“Ah?” The waiter was stunned, but he still looked at the two men from lone wolf in fear.</p><p>“Don’t worry. From now on, there won’t be any lone wolf adventurer team on golden sand island!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The others were shocked. What did Lu Ming mean?</p><p>They quickly understood.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the two burly men and said, ” “Lead the way!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The two big men were a little stunned.</p><p>lead the way to your lone wolf adventurer team’s lair. Hurry up!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and murderous intent filled the air.</p><p>The two burly men shuddered. Lu Ming actually wanted to go to the lone wolf adventurer team’s lair. What was he going to do? Destroy the lone wolf adventurer team?</p><p>“Could it be that I’ve really provoked two fiends that I shouldn’t have provoked this time?” The two men’s hearts turned cold.</p><p>“If you don’t want to die immediately, then hurry up!”</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes grew stronger.</p><p>The two burly men turned pale and nodded hurriedly. No matter what, they would leave this matter to their Regiment commander, lone wolf. They prayed in their hearts that lone wolf would be able to kill Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>With the two burly men leading the way, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing headed for the lone wolf adventurer team’s base.</p><p>let’s go and take a look. These two young men are actually going to kill their way into the lone wolf adventurer team’s lair. It’s too shocking!</p><p>they definitely have the right to be so confident. This time, the lone wolf adventurer team is likely to have kicked an iron plate.</p><p>“I’ve heard that recently, many young geniuses from the eastern wasteland have entered the chaotic Astral Ocean to train. It’s very likely that these two are those geniuses. It seems that I must keep a low profile when I see young people these days!”</p><p>The rest of the people in the restaurant discussed as they followed Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After the others on the road found out the truth, they also followed. In a short while, there were hundreds of people following behind.</p><p>There are many adventurer teams in the chaotic Astral Ocean. These adventurer teams usually enter some dangerous places to take risks and search for treasures.</p><p>However, most of the adventurer teams mainly worked as guards for the merchant teams and earned money.</p><p>The flame Chamber of Commerce had hired an adventurer team before.</p><p>The base of the lone wolf adventurer team was in a mountain three thousand miles west of the city.</p><p>“What’s going on? Enemy attack!”</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, a loud cry was heard from the lone wolf adventurer team’s lair.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and understood. There were hundreds of people behind them. It was no wonder that the lone wolf adventurer team was screaming in fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the next moment, streaks of light flashed in the mountains. More than a hundred people appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The leader of the group was a middle-aged man with a gloomy face and a ruthless look in his eyes.</p><p>leader, leader, help! The two of them, kill big brother li!</p><p>The two burly men in front of Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The burly man in the lead was the leader of the lone wolf adventurer team, lone wolf.</p><p>“What? Second brother is dead?” In an instant, lone Wolf’s eyes turned red.</p><p>He then looked at Lu Ming with a murderous look and said in an extremely cold voice,”Brat, no matter what the reason is, I’ll skin you alive and pull out your tendons after you kill my second brother. Also …”</p><p>I’ll reward you to my brothers. They’ll take turns serving you. You’ll have your fill! Gu lang looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing said that, everyone in lone wolf looked at him with burning eyes.</p><p>“Oh, I originally wanted to explain to you why I killed your second brother, but it seems that there’s no need to now.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Ocean follows the law of survival, the law of the jungle. What Bullsh * t logic is this? it doesn’t work here at all.</p><p>As long as there was strength, there would be reason.</p><p>Lu Ming understood this point very quickly.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his fingers and two spearlights shot out, killing the two burly men who were leading the way.</p><p>Then, he stepped forward and walked towards lone wolf.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Gu Lang’s eyes turned cold. A giant wolf appeared above his head, and a violent and bloodthirsty aura burst out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lone Wolf’s legs kicked in the air and his figure immediately turned into a series of afterimages, pouncing toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. A long spear condensed in his hand. With a wave of his arm, the long spear shot out like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The next moment, a shrill scream was heard, and a figure retreated frantically.</p><p>It was Gu lang. At this moment, his eyes were filled with disbelief. His chest had been pierced by a long spear. The powerful destructive force had already destroyed his internal organs.</p><p>One move, just a casual move, and the long spear had pierced through his heart.</p><p>That spear was too fast and too sharp. He couldn’t avoid it at all.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Spear’s immense power sent lone wolf flying a few thousand meters and nailed him to the cliff of the mountain.</p><p>Lone wolf, dead!</p><p>The people who came to watch were dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations. He was too powerful. Lone wolf was completely defenseless in his hands.</p><p>“Who is this person? Could he be a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t know his name!”</p><p>A series of shocked discussions could be heard.</p><p>On the other hand, the members of the lone wolf adventurer team looked terrified. Their leader, a peak-tier King, had been killed in one move.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Immediately, those people turned around and ran!</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Xie nianqing stepped into the air and pressed his palm.</p><p>The sky demon power field exploded, and the hundred or so lone wolf adventurers were all enveloped by it. A destructive cutting power was produced, and in the next moment, all one hundred or so people were killed. Their corpses fell to the ground like rain.</p><p>As for the storage rings, they were all taken by Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
