Otherwise, hehe!”</p><p>Xie nianqing revealed a pair of beautiful tiger teeth and chuckled triumphantly.</p><p>“Listen to you? That’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward Xie nianqing with a smile.</p><p>“Really?” Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly picked Xie nianqing up by the waist and slapped him on the butt. He smiled and said, ” fake! How dare you threaten me? I’ll spank your butt!</p><p>Xie nianqing was stunned for a moment before his face turned red. He shouted, ” “Lu Ming, you dare to hit me … Hit my … I’m not done with you!”</p><p>damn, it’s not the first time I’ve tried it. Eh, the feel has gotten better. It’s even more bouncy than before.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shrieked. Her vital essence burst forth and she escaped from Lu Ming’s ‘evil clutches’. She gritted her teeth and glared at Lu Ming. However, her face and even her ears were red, adding to her shyness and making her even more beautiful.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re so beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said subconsciously.</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked her big eyes and blushed even more. Suddenly, a bright smile appeared on her face. “Hmph, you have good taste. I’ll let you off this time!”</p><p>“This works too? His expression changed way too quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>nest, I can’t stand it anymore. You’re talking about love in front of me. Damn it, damn it. I must have 3000 harem members. I’ll anger you to death, anger you to death!</p><p>Dandan mumbled and ran to the front to observe the array.</p><p>Lu Ming found it funny. He then looked at Xie nianqing and said,”Little Qing, what about you? You’re hiding a lot of secrets from me, aren’t you?”</p><p>“What secret do I have?”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked.</p><p>“You don’t have any? For example, I’ve seen your sister before.”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>At the mention of this, Xie nianqing’s face darkened and he didn’t say anything.</p><p>After a long while, Xie nianqing finally spoke, ” “It’s not that I want to hide it from you, but now is not the time to tell you.”</p><p>“It’s not the time to say it yet? Why?” Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>“It’s very simple. It’s because your cultivation base is too weak. When you’re strong enough, I’ll naturally tell you,”</p><p>After Xie nianqing finished speaking, he stopped talking.</p><p>“Strength? It seems that little Qing’s background is really not simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Since Xie nianqing did not want to talk about it now, Lu Ming did not continue asking.</p><p>She studied the inscriptions carefully. After a moment, she continued to guide Lu Ming and Xie nianqing as they continued on their way.</p><p>A few hours later, they finally passed through the layers of inscription formations and arrived in front of a mountain peak. On the mountain peak, there was a Palace.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be any more inscription formations in front, so we can reach the peak directly!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Although dandan had said so, Lu Ming still did not dare to be careless. He headed to the mountain peak cautiously.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, there was a huge Palace with golden walls.</p><p>In front of the palace, there was a huge square.</p><p>The square was completely paved with white jade and was extremely luxurious.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Xie nianqing arrived at the peak, they stopped, their eyes solemn.</p><p>spiritual practitioner han Dao, the Crimson old monster, and that flood Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the White jade square, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>The spiritual warrior han Dao, the Crimson old monster, and the flood Dragon were all in the square.</p><p>However, both sides seemed to be in trouble.</p><p>On the White jade square, inscriptions were densely packed and black, like small black snakes slithering, forming an inscription array.</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao and the Crimson old freak were covered with runes. The black runes kept drilling into their bodies. The two of them stood in the square and tried their best to resist.</p><p>However, it was difficult for him to move his body.</p><p>On the other side of the square, the flood Dragon was facing the same situation. It had transformed into a human and was standing on the square. Countless inscriptions were also drilling into its body from all directions.</p><p>what a wonderful inscription formation! The inscriptions seem to be alive!</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the inscription on the White jade square, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>On the square, spiritual practitioner han Dao and the rest also saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The spiritual warrior han Dao and the Crimson old monster were both surprised. They didn’t expect that there would be someone else who could make it here. Furthermore, it was a young man and a young woman. Judging from their cultivation, they were only peak King tiers.</p><p>In the next moment, Spirit Warrior han Dao’s eyes flashed with ecstasy. In the depths of his ecstasy, there was a trace of cold light as he shouted, ” “You two, you’ve come at the right time. Now that the flood Dragon is trapped by the inscription formation, it can’t move. You two go kill it now. No, little brother, you go alone and leave the girl!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.”Senior, that flood Dragon is too powerful. I’m afraid I can’t kill it.”</p><p>“Why can’t you kill him? he’s trapped and can’t move at all. If he moves, he’ll be killed by the inscription formation. How can you not kill him when you’re attacking his vital parts?”</p><p>Spiritual being han Dao shouted.</p><p>“How about this, the two of us will attack the flood Dragon together, so we’ll have a higher chance of winning!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“No, that girl has other things to do. Hurry up and do it, don’t miss this opportunity!”</p><p>Spiritual being han Dao shouted.</p><p>“Senior, I still don’t think I can do it alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course! Kid, you should know who I am. I’m a spiritual practitioner with a cold saber. Now, I order you to kill that flood Dragon immediately!</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao’s face darkened and he ordered.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. This old fellow finally could not hold back and revealed his true colors.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. although I’m not talented, I do have some understanding of inscriptions. This formation is extremely mysterious. If I attack the flood Dragon, even if I can kill him, I will be trapped in the formation. With my cultivation, if I’m trapped in this formation, I will die. You want me to do it alone and leave my friend behind because you want her to help you crack the formation base around the square, right? ”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s face turned even gloomier. He did not expect that Lu Ming could see through his thoughts at such a young age.</p><p>That’s right, that was his plan.</p><p>“You’re quite smart, kid, but do you have any other choice? If you don’t do as I say, when I come out, both of you will die. I advise you to do as I say, and that little girl may still live, and you can die a quick death!”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao sneered, revealing his ferocious face.</p><p>“Oh, really? Do we have no other choice? How could that be? We can just go around the side and enter the main hall, obtain the treasures inside, and then swagger away. Isn’t that a better choice?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Junior, you dare? If you dare to do this, I swear I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The cold saber spiritual being’s voice was extremely cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
