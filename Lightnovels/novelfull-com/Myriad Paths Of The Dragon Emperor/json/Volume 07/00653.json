A blood-colored palm print shot towards Chen Dao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Chen Dao attacked with his blade, and the blade light was extremely dazzling.</p><p>But this time, Chen Dao’s blade light didn’t split the blood palm print. Instead, the blade light was dispersed by the blood palm.</p><p>Chen Dao’s face changed and he roared. The second slash was even stronger than the first.</p><p>However, Xue gang’s blood-colored palm prints arrived again. One after another, they were extremely overbearing.</p><p>Chen Dao continued to attack, the sixth, the seventh …</p><p>Soon, it was his seventh saber move. Before, he had killed the spiritual turtle Sage with the seventh saber move, but now, he was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>Chen Dao roared and slashed out the 8th and 9th blade.</p><p>The blade light was resplendent as it split the palm print, but there were countless palm prints that followed, one after another.</p><p>After the 9th slash, Chen Dao’s body retreated rapidly.</p><p>bloodline martial skill, that is a heaven level upper class bloodline martial skill. Chen Dao is going to lose.</p><p>A white-haired old man in the stands exclaimed.</p><p>“What? He has learned a bloodline martial technique.”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“Bloodline martial technique?” Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The so-called bloodline martial technique was the martial technique that a martial artist comprehended from his own bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline of a martial artist contained endless wealth. It was not as simple as a pure bloodline explosion.</p><p>The martial skills that a warrior comprehended from his or her own bloodline were the ones that truly belonged to him or her. They were the most compatible with him or her, and when he or she cultivated them, they would be extremely powerful.</p><p>After all, the martial skills of others belonged to others. How could they be compared with their own bloodline martial skills?</p><p>For example, if two warriors both cultivated to the sixth level of the heaven grade superior class martial technique, but one of them cultivated a bloodline martial technique that was comprehended from his own bloodline, then the power would be at least 50% or even 100% stronger than the other’s martial technique.</p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p>However, it was too difficult to comprehend bloodline martial techniques from one’s own bloodline. It required a unique talent. Moreover, the higher the bloodline level, the stronger the bloodline martial technique might be.</p><p>From one’s bloodline, one could not only comprehend martial skills, but also secret skills, which were called bloodline secret skills.</p><p>For example, Qin Qingshan and Saint constellation, whom Lu Ming had met before, had both comprehended the secret bloodline technique.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing’s palm would form a beautiful arm that would attack his opponent. That was the bloodline martial skill.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had yet to comprehend the bloodline martial arts technique.</p><p>First, the bloodline of the nine Dragons was not his own bloodline, but awakened by a drop of nine dragon blood essence. It was very difficult to comprehend bloodline martial techniques from it.</p><p>In fact, the devouring power could be regarded as a special bloodline secret skill of the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>As for the second bloodline, it had always been shrouded in fog. Lu Ming could not comprehend it even if he wanted to.</p><p>The bloodline martial techniques that special bloodlines could comprehend were even more powerful.</p><p>This was especially true for natural-type bloodlines.</p><p>For example, the fire bloodline was a fire-type martial technique that he had comprehended, and it just so happened to be able to complement his fire concept, making it even more powerful. In this aspect, it was something that other demonic beast bloodlines couldn’t compare to.</p><p>On the other hand, Gang Xue had comprehended the concept of blood. When combined with blood-related martial skills, his power was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xue gang took a big step forward and his Blood Concept spread out, enveloping Chen Dao. Chen Dao even had a feeling that the blood in his body was slowly drying up.</p><p>The mentality of blood was a special kind of mentality. It was extremely powerful and overbearing. If one was hit by Xue gang’s move that was combined with the mentality of blood, it could directly devour the opponent’s blood, causing the opponent’s blood to dry up and die.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Chen Dao’s blade light slashed out again, but it was useless. It was completely suppressed.</p><p>“Big brother, big brother, how could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s face was deathly pale, and he was extremely worried.</p><p>His elder brother was his backer. In fact, he was just a guard of the flame Chamber of Commerce. It was because of his elder brother that he had a special position in the flame Chamber of Commerce. He could get close to Luo Xin and even pursue her.</p><p>If his big brother died, he, an ordinary seventh level martial King, would be nothing in a place like the chaotic Astral Ocean. He would only be an ordinary guard in the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>His big brother was his everything.</p><p>Now, his big brother was in danger.</p><p>“Brother Chen Dao!”</p><p>Luo Xin’s hands were also tightly clenched, extremely nervous.</p><p>Chen Dao was a general of the flame Chamber of Commerce. He could even be said to be the strongest expert.</p><p>If Chen Dao died, the flame Chamber of Commerce would suffer a great loss.</p><p>“What do we do? What do we do?”</p><p>Luo Xin was extremely anxious.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xue gang’s attacks were getting stronger and stronger, and Chen Dao was already tired of dealing with them.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Chen Dao shouted.</p><p>“Admit defeat? I won’t allow it!”</p><p>Xue gang sneered.</p><p>“Don’t think that you’re the one who killed me!”</p><p>Seeing that he had no choice but to admit defeat, Chen Dao let out a long howl. His messy hair fluttered in the wind, and the aura on his body actually increased by a small amount.</p><p>He became one with his blade, turning into a bright blade light that shot up into the sky. Chen Dao planned to escape.</p><p>“It’s not that easy to escape!”</p><p>Xue gang turned into a bloody light and chased after him, throwing out a palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Chen Dao was hit by the palm and coughed up blood, but he couldn’t care about his injury anymore. He ran for his life and flew to the stands.</p><p>Blood gang gave chase.</p><p>I’ll give you 2000000 Supreme spiritual crystals if you let me go. Otherwise, you might not be able to kill me if I try to escape.</p><p>Chen Dao roared and started to beg for mercy. He turned into a blade light and fled in all directions.</p><p>gutless rat! Five million Supreme spiritual crystals, not a single one less!</p><p>Xue gang roared.</p><p>“Five million it is!”</p><p>His life was more important, so Chen Dao threw a storage ring to Gang Xue.</p><p>Blood just caught it, scanned it with his mind, and then stopped chasing.</p><p>“You’re lucky, but you’re really boring!”</p><p>Xue gang didn’t pursue him. He returned to the fighting ring.</p><p>Chen Dao turned into a blade light and flew back to the stands. He grabbed a pill and swallowed it. He started to heal himself.</p><p>Luo Xin and Chen Zhao heaved a sigh of relief when they finally survived.</p><p>Even though the process was embarrassing.</p><p>“There’s always a higher mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly.</p><p>Chen Zhao’s face and ears turned red. Lu Ming’s words were obviously meant for him.</p><p>Hmph, my big brother won eight consecutive victories. It’s nothing strange for him to meet someone stronger. If you go up there, I’m afraid you’ll die in less than two rounds.</p><p>Chen Zhao was still stubborn.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said to Xie nianqing, ” “Let’s go!” Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming in surprise. Then, he followed Lu Ming out.</p><p>“Hmph, cowards don’t dare to fight in the end!”</p><p>Chen Zhao mocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly turned around and threw a slap.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A slap landed directly on Chen Zhao’s face. Blood and teeth flew everywhere, and one side of Chen Zhao’s face instantly bulged.</p><p>He was stunned and looked at Lu Ming in a daze. After a while, he came to his senses and roared hysterically, ” “You … You dare to hit me? I’m going to ask my big brother to kill you, to kill you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
