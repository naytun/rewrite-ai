Come, let mother take a good look!”</p><p>...</p><p>Li Ping happily pulled Lu Ming to sit down and look around.</p><p>Lu Yuntian was all smiles as well.</p><p>“Father, mother, Ming ‘er is very well. Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sat down with Li Ping and the other two.</p><p>“Father, Ming ‘er came back this time mainly to treat your meridians.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? To treat my meridians?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s hand, which was holding the teacup, suddenly trembled.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Yuntian was rather shocked.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, is what you said true? Can you really cure your father’s meridians?” Li Ping also looked at Lu Ming excitedly.</p><p>that’s right. Father, mother, this time, Ming ‘er has obtained a bottle of the legendary water of life. It can definitely cure father’s injuries!</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and the elixir of life appeared in his hand.</p><p>elixir of life, elixir of life, I didn’t think that there would be such a treasure in the world? ”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said excitedly.</p><p>“Dad, take it. I’ll help you refine it!”</p><p>Lu Ming, give me, Lu Yuntian, the elixir of life.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian received it and took a deep breath before drinking it in one gulp. He immediately sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming placed his palm on Lu Yuntian’s back. Quintessential essence continuously gushed into Lu Yuntian’s body to help him refine the water of life.</p><p>The water of life transformed into a vigorous life force that nourished Lu Yuntian’s meridians. Wherever this force passed by, Lu Yuntian’s broken and withered meridians would be reconnected. Furthermore, they would become more energetic and tougher.</p><p>Two hours later, the elixir of life had been completely refined, and Lu Yuntian’s meridians had been completely healed. In fact, they were several times stronger than before. His body was filled with life energy, and his blood and Qi were full of vitality.</p><p>“Alright, I’m really alright now!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian circulated his cultivation technique and looked at the fiery red true energy on his palm. He was so excited that his entire body trembled, and tears welled up in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s cultivation base had already reached the martial Grandmaster realm. Now that his meridians had recovered, he immediately recovered a little of his cultivation base with Lu Ming’s help.</p><p>It had been so many years. He had thought that he would never be able to practice martial arts or recover his true Qi, but now, he had it all back.</p><p>No one could understand Lu Yuntian’s current feelings.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, thank you!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian took a deep breath and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Father, you and I are father and son, there’s no need to thank me. This is what I should do.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. He was extremely happy to see Lu Yuntian recover.</p><p>“That’s great, that’s great!”</p><p>Beside him, Li Ping was also extremely excited.</p><p>In this world, no one understood Lu Yuntian better than she did.</p><p>Lu Yuntian had always had a heart for martial arts. He was a natural-born warrior. The fact that he could not cultivate was a huge blow to him.</p><p>Now, everything was fine.</p><p>“Father, take these cultivation methods, martial arts techniques, and medicinal pills!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the cultivation methods, martial arts techniques, elixirs, spirit weapons, and other things that he had prepared for Lu Yuntian.</p><p>These were all carefully selected by Lu Ming. They were the most suitable for Lu Yuntian of all levels and were enough for Lu Yuntian to use until he reached the martial King realm.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, do you have enough for yourself?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian asked.</p><p>He was afraid that Lu Ming had given him so many resources and he would be useless.</p><p>In comparison, Lu Ming was more important.</p><p>He was already very happy that he could cultivate. He had to leave the resources for Lu Ming. After all, Lu Ming was at the golden age for cultivation.</p><p>“Father, don’t worry. Ming ‘er has a lot of resources on him!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Only then did Lu Yuntian receive it.</p><p>father, this bottle is a mid-grade innate original fluid. Take it with mother and slowly use it. Not only can it help you cultivate your body, but it can also improve mother’s body!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming took out the bottle of mid-grade connate original liquid and handed it to Lu Yuntian.</p><p>mid-grade innate original liquid!</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s heart trembled. He knew very well that the value of a mid-grade connate original fluid was simply an astronomical figure. It was a figure that he could not imagine.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lu Yuntian looked at Lu Ming seriously and asked, ” “Ming ‘er, what’s your current cultivation level?”</p><p>“I’m at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm, but it’ll take some time before I can break through to the peak of the king realm!” Lu Ming did not hide anything.</p><p>peak Lv 9 martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s heart skipped a beat. Then, he was overjoyed.</p><p>good, good, good. Father will take this bottle of innate original liquid!</p><p>Lu Yuntian burst out laughing.</p><p>The peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm was a realm that he did not even dare to think about. Lu Ming had reached it at such a young age. How could he not be happy?</p><p>This was Lu Yuntian’s son!</p><p>The three of them chatted for a while longer before Lu Yuntian rushed into his room impatiently and started cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With Lu Yuntian’s talent, he believed that it would not take long for him to recover to his peak cultivation.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s return did not spread.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming would chat with Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. He would spend the rest of his time fully comprehending the concept of Thunder.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Yuntian’s cultivation base had recovered to the peak of the ninth grade master realm. He would be able to return to the great master realm very soon.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s Thunder will finally had a breakthrough and reached the full circle of level one.</p><p>now, I’ll start to upgrade my Wind and Fire intents to the completion of level one!</p><p>Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine, took out middle-grade profound meaning crystals, and started to break through.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming had used three of each of the two middle-grade profound meaning crystals to break through his Wind and Fire concepts to the full circle of level one.</p><p>With all three intents at perfection, Lu Ming’s cultivation base should have been able to reach peak-tier King.</p><p>However, he did not have enough resources.</p><p>Lu Ming only had about six million Supreme-grade spirit crystals. It was not enough for him to reach the peak-tier King level.</p><p>He had no choice but to put it aside for the time being and focus on cultivating the Dragon God’s three absolutes.</p><p>He had already achieved level one perfection in all three intents. He could cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the sixth level.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming was on his way to the imperial capital.</p><p>He started to think about the things under the earth cave again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not manage to dig it out when he was at the first level of the martial King realm. Now, he wanted to give it another try.</p><p>However, before he went to the earth cave, he first found Hua Chi and talked to him about the past. Then, he went to the earth cave.</p><p>No one noticed Lu Ming’s figure. Without a sound or trace, Lu Ming arrived at the lowest level of the earth cave, which was the fourteenth level, the level that Lu Ming had dug out earlier.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, this place did not affect him at all. He continued digging.</p><p>The fifteenth level, the sixteenth level, the seventeenth level …</p><p>When Lu Ming dug out the seventeenth level, he wanted to continue digging, but he realized that the bottom was empty.</p><p>Lu Ming dug a hole and dashed down. He realized that there was a huge underground cave below.</p><p>In this place, the fire spiritual energy was so violent that it was unimaginable.</p><p>In the air above the underground cave, a ball of fire was burning like a sun.</p><p>Endless heat spread out from the ball of flames.</p><p>“Nest, this is the earth core flowing flame. Kid, you’ve struck it rich!”</p><p>Dandan suddenly shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
