Be good and help me find the way!</p><p>...</p><p>Yun Luo laughed out loud, her face extremely ferocious.</p><p>It was because of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing that he was besieged by four powerful young men and lost an arm.</p><p>Originally, he was already about to break through to the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, but because he lost an arm, his vitality was greatly damaged. Not only was it difficult for his cultivation to break through, it even showed signs of declining. Right now, his cultivation could only barely maintain at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, and after losing an arm, his battle power dropped a little compared to before.</p><p>His hatred for Lu Ming and the rest could not be washed away even with the Yellow River.</p><p>to Scout the way for you, Yun Luo. You wish. Why don’t you go and Scout the way yourself? ”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the middle-aged man’s corpse and sneered.</p><p>Compared to the time when they fought with Yun Luo, his and Xie nianqing’s combat strength had greatly improved. Why would they be afraid of Yun Luo now?</p><p>However, Yun Luo did not know that he had been besieged by the four young masters before he was defeated. Now, there were only Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. He was 100% confident that he could suppress them.</p><p>“You’re not going to Scout the way? If you don’t, I’ll kill you right now!”</p><p>Yun Luo said coldly.</p><p>“This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say to you. Last time, you ran away. This time, you can stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he strode forward.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Lu Ming walked side by side towards Yun Luo.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yun Luo growled and waved her arm. Two rings of fire appeared and shot towards Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear expanded and the three-colored concept revolved around it. The spear shot out and collided with the two rings of fire.</p><p>There was a loud bang and the two rings were blasted back by Lu Ming.</p><p>you … Yun Luo’s expression changed drastically as she exclaimed, ” how can you be so strong? ”</p><p>“Sky demon force field, destruction cut, kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and pushed with her hand. A powerful force field of the sky demon enveloped Yun Luo, and the destructive cutting force exploded.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Yun Luo’s expression changed again. She kept waving her hand and exploded with all her strength. Rings of flame appeared to resist the cutting power from all directions.</p><p>The explosions continued, and sparks flew everywhere.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and instantly, dozens of spear gleams shot towards Yun Luo.</p><p>Under Xie nianqing’s intentional control, the demonic energy field did not affect Lu Ming’s attack at all.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yun Luo was at a complete disadvantage against the combined forces of Xie nianqing and Lu Ming.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was that possible? How did these two little B * stards become so strong? You should die!”</p><p>Yun Luo was horrified and tried her best to resist.</p><p>However, his combat strength was not as good as before. He was no match for Lu Ming and his partner and was completely suppressed. In a short while, two wounds appeared on his body, caused by the destructive cutting power. If he had not dodged in time, he would have been cut in half.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go. If this continues, I’ll definitely die!”</p><p>Yun Luo frantically retreated, but he was enveloped by the sky demon force field and his speed was much slower. No matter how much he retreated, Xie nianqing would move forward and keep him under his protection.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His neck was cut by the spear ray, and a bloody mark appeared, almost piercing his throat.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He roared. He was really afraid. He was afraid that he would die Here.</p><p>More and more wounds appeared on his body.</p><p>spare me, please spare me. I can give you Supreme spiritual crystals. How about 10 million? ”</p><p>Yun Luo shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s attacks became even more violent.</p><p>“20 million, I’ll give you 20 million, please spare me!”</p><p>Yun Luo shouted.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s footwork responded to him. Lu Ming strode forward and the distance between him and Yun Luo was getting closer and closer. His attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>“As long as we kill you, your wealth will be ours. Why do we need you to give it to us?”</p><p>A slightly mocking voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming turned into a spear ray and shot out.</p><p>An extreme strike!</p><p>PU Chi! the spear light pierced through Yun Luo’s heart. Yun Luo roared loudly, her voice filled with unwillingness.</p><p>If he had known that he would end up like this, he would not have come to the rainbow Island this time.</p><p>The result of this was death!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook. Yun Luo was dead!</p><p>He reached out and swallowed Yun Luo’s blood essence.</p><p>As soon as Yun Luo’s blood essence entered the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, there was a violent boom. The energy was too terrifying. Lu Ming had to refine it immediately.</p><p>little Qing, I’m going to cultivate for a while. Please protect me!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and focused on refining the blood essence.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming curiously. She did not understand why Lu Ming suddenly wanted to cultivate again.</p><p>After refining for half a day, he finally refined all of Yun Luo’s blood essence.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged and roared at the sky. Suddenly, another chakra emerged above the eight bright chakra.</p><p>The ninth silver chakra was a ninth level King level bloodline.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes suddenly widened and his mouth was slightly open. He was in disbelief.</p><p>bloodline upgrade, this guy’s bloodline can actually upgrade. No wonder, no wonder this guy has always been so abnormal. Every time my strength has improved greatly, I can’t surpass him!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The light of the ninth chakra was dimmer than that of the other eight, which was because it had not reached its peak.</p><p>After a while, the nine Dragons bloodline disappeared into Lu Ming’s body. He opened his eyes.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, he saw a beautiful face in front of him. Her eyes were wide open and she was staring at him without blinking. She was only a few inches away from his face. Lu Ming could even feel Xie nianqing’s breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and asked,”what are you doing?” You want to take advantage of my cultivation and take advantage of me!”</p><p>“Taking advantage of you? You wish.”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted, then looked at Lu Min curiously. “Your bloodline can actually be upgraded. How amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He was not surprised. He had no intention of hiding from Xie nianqing when he was cultivating just now.</p><p>In fact, even if he avoided it, Xie nianqing would have guessed it.</p><p>After all, he had known Xie nianqing for a few years. Xie nianqing was well aware of his bloodline level back then. Now that his bloodline level had increased, Xie nianqing must have been suspicious.</p><p>my first bloodline has the ability to devour the blood essence of humans and demonic beasts to increase the level of my bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and said.</p><p>However, he didn’t say the first bloodline’s name. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Xie nianqing. On the contrary, he trusted Xie nianqing. However, this matter was too important. If anything happened, not only him, but Xie nianqing would be in danger as well.</p><p>there’s actually such a wondrous ability. How wondrous!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up as he exclaimed.</p><p>you’re the only one I’ve told about this. I hope you won’t tell anyone else. Otherwise, I’m going to be taken away for research.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You really only told me one?”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
