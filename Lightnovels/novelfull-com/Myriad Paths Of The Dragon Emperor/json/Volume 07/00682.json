Whoosh!</p><p>Streaks of sword Qi and saber Qi shot in all directions. One could clearly see with the naked eye that there were traces in the nearby space.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao was injured and suppressed by the sky demon force field. On the other hand, Lu Ming and the King of Hell could unleash their full power. For a time, the battle between the four of them was extremely intense.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth began to shake. The four of them could feel the rainbow Island shaking violently, and the shaking was getting more and more intense.</p><p>“Not good. The seven-colored Island is about to return to the void.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>In the distance, a martial artist shouted.</p><p>“How do we leave?”</p><p>fly to the sky. The seven-colored Island is covered by the inscription formation. As long as you fly to the sky and break through the inscription formation, you can leave. Hurry!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One could see streaks of light appearing from the mountains and flying into the sky at high speed.</p><p>The expressions of Lu Ming and the rest changed.</p><p>However, everyone was in a state of anxiety, and no one stopped. If one side stopped and the other side took advantage of the situation to attack, they would definitely be at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, the four of them also consciously charged toward the sky, fighting as they flew.</p><p>After flying for tens of thousands of meters, one could see that there was indeed a light screen above their heads, covering the seven-colored Island. In the distance, rainbow lights kept bombarding the light screen, then breaking through it and disappearing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the four of them fought, when they reached the edge of the light curtain, the light curtain was naturally pierced through, and the four of them rushed out.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared outside and realized that he was floating in the air. Not far away, a part of the rainbow Island had already escaped into the void. The remaining part was also constantly entering the void and would soon disappear.</p><p>Around the seven colored Island, there were figures that kept flashing and appearing. They were the people who came from the seven colored Island.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Not far away, a dazzling golden light flashed.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao and the King of Hell were closer to each other. He made the first move, wanting to kill one of them first before dealing with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>How could Lu Ming let him have his way? he took one step with the nine Dragons sky-treading steps and turned into a stream of light. He appeared behind the spiritual practitioner in an instant and directly greeted him with his long spear.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The King of Hell had been on guard against him. His sudden attack did not severely injure the King of Hell. On the other hand, Lu Ming’s speed and reaction were terrifyingly fast. He arrived immediately, foiling his plan to severely injure the King of Hell in one fell swoop.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, a huge pressure pressed down on han Dao’s body, and Xie nianqing followed closely behind.</p><p>This made the spiritual being han Dao so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Among the three of them, Xie nianqing was the one who gave him the biggest headache. The suppression of the sky demon force field and the sneak attack of the destructive cutting made it impossible for him to use all his strength.</p><p>Lu Ming and the King of Hell were in charge of the fierce attacks.</p><p>He was confident that he could easily crush and kill any one of them alone, but it would be too difficult to deal with the three of them together.</p><p>This area was boiling with excitement as the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>The people nearby were all alarmed.</p><p>“That’s the spiritual practitioner han Dao. Who are those three? He can actually fight with the spiritual practitioner han Dao?”</p><p>what powerful battle strength! These three young men are all peak-tier Kings. Unbelievable. Peak-tier Kings can actually fight against Spirit Warrior han Dao? ”</p><p>Asura, Yama, and Yaksha. That’s right, it’s the three of them. Their moves are exactly the same. They actually joined forces to fight against the spiritual practitioner with the cold saber. What’s going on? ”</p><p>Oh my God, it must be the three of them. I guess they had a conflict on the seven-colored Island!</p><p>Most of the people around were peak-tier Kings, and there were a few sea of soul realm experts. All of them were shocked by this scene.</p><p>Spiritual warrior han Dao was a powerful existence at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. They could see that his aura was weak and he should be injured, but this was already shocking enough.</p><p>Many people stood in the air and watched from afar.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The seven-colored Island continued to sink into the void and soon disappeared.</p><p>The commotion on the rainbow Island shook the entire golden sand island. Countless figures flew over and watched in shock as the rainbow Island was about to disappear. At the same time, they were also shocked by the battle between Lu Ming and the others and the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>“Feng Chuan, come and help me kill these three little bastards!”</p><p>Spiritual warrior han Dao called out. He called an expert at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm who was watching nearby.</p><p>Feng Chuan was an old acquaintance of the cold saber spiritual practitioner, but they were not close friends.</p><p>At that moment, Feng Chuan’s expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the King of Hell were too powerful. Even if he attacked, he might not be able to kill them in one blow. If they counterattacked, he might die Here.</p><p>Furthermore, the other party was still so young and had shocking potential. If he didn’t kill them all, he would have to hide and not dare to appear when the other party broke through to the spirit ocean realm.</p><p>Therefore, he hesitated and couldn’t make a decision.</p><p>“Feng Chuan, what are you waiting for? Do you want to die?”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao threatened.</p><p>Feng Chuan’s expression turned ugly again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and pressed his arm again. A beautiful arm formed. The arm was huge, and the palm alone was ten meters wide. It pressed towards the spirit Warrior.</p><p>This was Xie nianqing’s bloodline martial skill.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>“Golden light tear!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the King of Hell also unleashed their strongest attacks.</p><p>They had to end the battle as soon as possible. The longer it dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for them. The spiritual practitioner han Dao knew many people, but they were outsiders and didn’t know many people.</p><p>The three of them all used their strongest killing moves. The spirit Warrior han Dao’s expression changed and he used all his power to defend.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The three’s power landed on the spiritual being han Dao’s body. The spiritual being han Dao’s blade light was destroyed, and the ice Armor covering his body was also not cracked. He screamed and his body flew far away, spitting out a large amount of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two pounced on the spiritual practitioner han Dao crazily.</p><p>“Cold blade Storm!”</p><p>An abnormal color flashed across the spiritual practitioner han Dao’s face. He slashed hundreds of times in an instant, aiming at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The three of them joined hands to destroy the spiritual practitioner’s cold blade Storm with one strike and then rushed towards him.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s face turned pale.</p><p>He was actually at a disadvantage. If this continued, he would be in danger.</p><p>At this moment, a Scarlet sword Qi crossed the void and slashed at Lu Ming and the other two. The three of them were shocked and blocked the sword light, but their bodies could not help but stop.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An old man in a red robe appeared and stood in front of the spiritual practitioner.</p><p>It was the red-haired old monster.</p><p>haha, Reddie, you’re here. Good, let’s kill these three little bastards together!</p><p>Seeing the Crimson old monster, the spiritual being han Dao was overjoyed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the King of Hell’s faces turned grave. The three of them stood side by side, staring at the spiritual practitioner han Dao and the Crimson old monster.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao alone was already hard enough to deal with, and now there was the Crimson old monster.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
