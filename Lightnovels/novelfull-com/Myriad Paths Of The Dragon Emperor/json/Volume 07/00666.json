It was a little flustered.</p><p>“Senior, let’s kill this tiger shark together!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear. The huge Spear’s radiance was thousands of meters long and it was aimed at the tiger shark.</p><p>“Haha, let’s kill this beast!”</p><p>The blue-robed man’s eyes flickered with an ominous glint. He held a combat sword that was wider than his palm and slashed out a shocking sword radiance toward the tiger shark.</p><p>Lu Ming and the blue-robed burly man joined forces. The tiger shark was immediately at a disadvantage and was completely suppressed.</p><p>Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!</p><p>Lu Ming took four consecutive steps. The violent force was like an ancient divine mountain smashing on the tiger shark’s body. The tiger shark’s body trembled. Below, the blue-robed man’s sword light rushed up and left a wound that was more than ten meters long on the tiger shark’s body. One of its fins was cut off and it was sent flying far away.</p><p>The tiger shark roared angrily. In its fear, it did not dare to fight anymore and wanted to escape.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and blocked the tiger shark’s path of retreat. He punched more than a hundred times in a row. More than a hundred explosive fist gleams blocked the tiger shark’s path and tore open wounds on the tiger shark’s body. Although the wounds were not big, they made the tiger shark bleed.</p><p>There were even some fist auras that were aimed at the tiger shark’s wounds, which made the tiger shark’s injuries worse.</p><p>“Sky piercing sword, kill!”</p><p>The blue-robed man arrived with a terrifying sword radiance that could tear everything apart. It slashed at the tiger shark’s wound and directly cut its body into two.</p><p>The tiger shark at the spirit sea level was dead!</p><p>“Haha, little brother, thank you!”</p><p>The blue-robed man grinned, but his eyes still flickered with a fierce light.</p><p>This was a vicious person. If it was not for Lu Ming’s powerful combat strength that had gained his recognition, he would not even care about Lu Ming. If he did not like the look of Lu Ming, he would have killed him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was already at the same level as him. Naturally, he restrained his ferocious aura.</p><p>“Let’s go and kill the other great demons of the spirit sea!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, none of these bastards will leave today!”</p><p>The blue-robed man’s face revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>On the other side, King Yama and another sea of soul realm warrior had also killed a sea of soul realm beast.</p><p>This way, other than the flood Dragon, there were only seven spiritual ocean tier beasts left.</p><p>On the human side, other than the spiritual practitioner han Dao, there were nine other sea of soul realm experts. Lu Ming and the King of Hell were also at sea of soul realm. Of course, there was also Xie nianqing. The high-end combat power of the human side had already gained the upper hand.</p><p>But at this moment, a Dragon’s Roar resounded through the sky and a figure descended rapidly. It was the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>Spiritualist han Dao spat out a mouthful of blood and fell rapidly. Above him, the flood Dragon roared and its huge body slithered down, chasing after him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blue divine light shot towards the spiritual being han Dao. He slashed out a blade light and barely blocked the attack. However, the remaining divine light still fell on his body, causing him to spit out a large amount of blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao fell into the sea. The next moment, he rushed out from the other side of the sea.</p><p>“Old man, die!”</p><p>The flood Dragon pounced at the spiritual practitioner.</p><p>Everyone’s heart sank. The spiritual practitioner han Dao was actually no match for him and was completely suppressed.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao was at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm, but he was still no match for the flood Dragon. The flood Dragon’s combat power was simply too strong.</p><p>This flood Dragon should be at the early stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, but its battle power couldn’t be calculated according to normal levels.</p><p>Flood Dragons contained the bloodline of true dragons. Whether it was its physical body or demonic power, it was extremely powerful. It also had some powerful combat skills. Although this flood Dragon was only at the early second level of the spiritual ocean tier, the spiritual practitioner han Dao was no match for it.</p><p>The flood Dragon pounced at the spiritual being han Dao. He didn’t dare to take it head-on, so he turned around and ran away.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The flood Dragon twisted its huge body and passed through the void, chasing after the spiritual practitioner han Dao at an extreme speed.</p><p>A blue godly light, like a godly sword, pierced towards the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao was shocked. He quickly moved his body to avoid the blue light.</p><p>At this moment, he changed his direction and headed toward Lu Ming and the blue-robed burly man.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao rushed toward Lu Ming and the blue-robed burly man.</p><p>you guys, help me block this flood Dragon. Hurry!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao shouted at Lu Ming and the blue-robed man in a commanding tone.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>His and the blue-robed man’s battle prowess was only at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm, which was far from the flood Dragon’s. That would be suicide.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s goal was simple. He wanted the two of them to die so that he would have time to escape.</p><p>Would Lu Ming be so stupid?</p><p>He would do his best to participate in this battle, but the premise was that he wouldn’t be in any danger. If there was a fatal danger, he and Xie nianqing would turn and leave.</p><p>To put it bluntly, he was not related to the people on the Golden sand island. What did their life and death have to do with Lu Ming?</p><p>I believe that many of the people present think so.</p><p>Now, the spiritual practitioner han Dao was asking him to die. How could that be possible?</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and flew far away, avoiding the spiritual practitioner and the flood Dragon.</p><p>The blue-robed man did the same and flew far away.</p><p>you two dare to escape in the face of battle and disregard the safety of the human race. You deserve to die!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao bellowed and looked at Lu Ming and the blue-robed spiritual practitioner with eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and could not be bothered with the frost saber spiritual practitioner.</p><p>Then, spiritual practitioner han Dao rushed towards hell King. Without a doubt, hell King and the other expert also turned around and left.</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao roared again and again as he was almost hit by the flood Dragon’s divine light.</p><p>His eyes turned cold, and he suddenly rushed toward another battlefield.</p><p>That battlefield was a battle between a human at the spiritual ocean tier and a great demon.</p><p>“Cold saber old freak, what are you doing?”</p><p>That sea of soul realm expert yelled in fear.</p><p>Since the spiritual practitioner han Dao had rushed over, it was obvious that he wanted to use him as a shield.</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao’s face was cold. He didn’t say a word and tried his best to rush forward.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>That spiritual ocean tier cultivator wanted to leave this place.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>That sea of soul realm beast would not let his opponent escape so easily. It launched a crazy attack, trying to hold him back.</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao rushed past the human expert.</p><p>And behind them was the flood Dragon.</p><p>“Human ants, go to hell!”</p><p>The flood Dragon’s huge claws clawed towards the human spiritual ocean tier expert.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Eccentric cold saber, you’re despicable!”</p><p>The spiritual ocean tier warrior roared and madly exploded, using all of his power, hoping to block the flood Dragon’s attack and then escape.</p><p>However, the difference between him and the flood Dragon was too great. Under the claw of the flood Dragon, all his attacks collapsed, and all his defenses were in vain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was grabbed by the flood dragon’s claw, and his bones all over his body made cracking sounds.</p><p>“Old ghost cold saber, I curse you to die without a burial place!”</p><p>That person roared, and then his aura rapidly declined.</p><p>The flood Dragon opened its big mouth and swallowed the human expert in one gulp, then continued to chase after the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
