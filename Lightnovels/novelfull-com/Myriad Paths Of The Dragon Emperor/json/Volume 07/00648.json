To the strong, this was heaven, but to the weak, this was hell. They had to live in fear, or else they could be killed at any time.</p><p>...</p><p>In another restaurant, the waiter respectfully welcomed Lu Ming and his wife with a flattering smile on his face.</p><p>The waiter wasn’t even a martial arts Grandmaster. On golden sand island, he was at the bottom of the hierarchy. Anyone could kill him with one finger. Therefore, he lived in fear and trepidation.</p><p>“My two guests, if you need anything, just tell me!”</p><p>The waiter invited Lu Ming and Xie nianqing to a table on the second floor and asked them with a smile.</p><p>“Just give us some wine and food!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and ordered some wine and dishes casually.</p><p>“Please wait for a moment, Sir, I’ll be right there!”</p><p>The waiter turned around and ran back, but he didn’t pay attention and bumped into a big man. The big man’s Zhen Yuan shook, and the waiter’s body was pushed back five or six steps, sitting on the ground.</p><p>“Kid, don’t you have eyes? You dare to hit me, I think you’re tired of living!”</p><p>This burly man had only one eye. He wore an eye patch and was staring fiercely at the waiter.</p><p>The waiter’s face instantly turned pale, without a trace of blood. He knelt down in front of the one-eyed man and began to kowtow, shouting,”My Lord, my Lord, please spare my life. I didn’t do it on purpose. Please spare my life, my Lord.”</p><p>The waiter kowtowed loudly. He didn’t dare to use his true Qi to defend himself, so his forehead started to bleed after a few hits.</p><p>But he didn’t dare to wipe it and continued to kowtow desperately.</p><p>“Hehe, spare you? You wish. Since you don’t have eyes when you walk, I’ll dig out your eyes and make you really not have eyes.”</p><p>The one-eyed man revealed a ferocious smile.</p><p>The waiter’s face was deathly pale and filled with despair. On golden sand island, with his cultivation level, if he were to go blind, only death would await him.</p><p>“My Lord, please spare me, please spare me just this once!”</p><p>The waiter desperately kowtowed and begged.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The one-eyed man remained unmoved, his eyes flashing with an ominous glint.</p><p>One of his own eyes had been gouged out. Since then, he especially liked to gouged out other people’s eyes. That way, he would have the pleasure of revenge.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The one-eyed man’s two fingers stabbed towards the waiter’s eye like lightning.</p><p>This burly man had reached the level of a lower tier King while the waiter and Wu Zong weren’t even there. There was a huge gap between them, and it was impossible for them to avoid him.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and raised his hand. A wave of essential core swept out and wrapped around Xiao ‘er. He pulled her back and dodged the attack of the one-eyed giant eye.</p><p>The waiter was pulled to the side of their table by Lu Ming. He was still in a state of shock and his entire body was trembling.</p><p>The one-eyed man looked in Lu Ming’s direction with a menacing look in his eyes, especially when he looked at Xie nianqing. It was a look of pure desire.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you interfere in my business? you must be tired of living.”</p><p>The one-eyed man smiled hideously and walked toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The waiter was terrified.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even look at the one-eyed man. He picked up the glass and took a sip slowly.</p><p>“Ta!” “Ta!”</p><p>The one-eyed man walked to Lu Ming’s table step by step. His voice was filled with killing intent. kid, you’re lucky today. Our big brother li has taken a fancy to this little girl. Let her go over and drink with him. Also, destroy your eyes and we’ll let this matter go. We’ll spare your life!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>He could tell that the man’s target was Xie nianqing.</p><p>As soon as they went upstairs, the one-eyed man’s table was already staring at Xie nianqing with a fiery gaze.</p><p>Then, the one-eyed man stood up and walked over. He deliberately stood behind the waiter, causing the waiter to bump into him.</p><p>Everything was done on purpose by the one-eyed man. He was just looking for a reason to cause trouble.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a sip of wine and coldly spat out the word ‘scram’.</p><p>The one-eyed man’s face changed, and his expression became even more ferocious,”Brat, I wanted to spare your life, but you’re just looking for death.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With that, the one-eyed man’s fingers were like swords, piercing toward Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Then, there was a shrill scream.</p><p>Of course, it was not Lu Ming who shouted, but the one-eyed man. Lu Ming flicked his finger and a Spear’s gleam flashed, blinding the one-eyed man’s other eye.</p><p>The one-eyed man covered his eye with his palm, blood flowing from his face. He let out a beast-like roar and scream.</p><p>“Ah, ah, kill, kill, little bastard, I’m going to kill you, I’m going to kill your entire family!”</p><p>The one-eyed man roared and pounced on Lu Ming as if he had gone mad.</p><p>The next moment, the one-eyed man’s body flew out of the window of the restaurant and fell heavily on the street outside the restaurant. His cries stopped abruptly.</p><p>The one-eyed man was dead.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At a table by the window, three burly men suddenly stood up, exuding a powerful and cold aura, causing the temperature in the restaurant to drop sharply, as if it was winter.</p><p>The one-eyed man was at the same table as these three people just now.</p><p>it’s lone wind! He’s from the lone wolf adventurer team!</p><p>that kid is in danger. He just killed one of lone wind’s men. Lone wind will never let him go!</p><p>that’s for sure. On golden sand island, the lone wolf adventurer team is pretty strong. This lone wind is used to being a tyrant.</p><p>the key is his big brother, lone wolf. He’s a peak-tier King!</p><p>The people around them were whispering to each other. Most of them were gloating at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The waiter’s face turned even paler when he heard the name lone wolf adventurer team, and his body trembled.</p><p>it’s over, it’s over. Young master, leave quickly, leave quickly. Don’t care about me. I’m just a worthless life. Don’t lose your life because of me.</p><p>The waiter said in a trembling voice.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. This waiter was quite kind-hearted. He was obviously scared to death but he still asked Lu Ming and the rest to leave.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly, his expression calm.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the three burly men had already walked to Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The person in front was in his thirties. His neck was slightly crooked, but his eyes were extremely cold. He stared at Lu Ming and said coldly, brat, how dare you kill a member of the lone wolf adventurer team! I’ll make your life a living hell today!</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Xie nianqing. His eyes scanned Xie nianqing’s body up and down, revealing his lust. little girl, draw a clear line with this kid right now, and then come back with me to serve me well. Be my maidservant, and then you can live comfortably on golden sand island. Do you understand? hurry!</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming took another sip of wine and said indifferently.</p><p>Gu Feng’s eyes glowed with ferocity. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Kid, what did you say? I don’t care what kind of force you’re from, but when you’re in the chaotic Astral Ocean and on the Golden sand island, even if you’re a Dragon, you’ll still have to coil up!”</p><p>Bzzzz …</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Gu Feng had already made his move. His claw was aimed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Gu Feng was a Lv 7 martial King realm expert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
