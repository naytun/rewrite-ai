The sword Qi was like a tide, sweeping toward Lu Ming.</p><p>On the Holy star, whether it was the physical body, cultivation techniques, or martial techniques, they were all extremely powerful. They far surpassed Ordinary Geniuses, and their battle prowess was extremely terrifying. Ordinary Geniuses on the same level as him couldn’t even take a single move from him.</p><p>Slowly, he began to suppress Lu Ming and gained the upper hand.</p><p>At that moment, a storm of killing intent was brewing in the eyes of the Holy star.</p><p>He was determined to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He was a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory and had entered the peak King’s realm. He had wanted to fulfill his ambition and push his ranking up.</p><p>But now, he was being blocked by a peak Lv 9 martial King realm martial artist and could not even fight for a long time.</p><p>If word of this got out, it would definitely be a fatal blow to his reputation.</p><p>His thoughts were exactly the same as Qin Qingshan’s. This was the pride of a peerless genius.</p><p>“Star slashing sword!”</p><p>With a loud roar, the Holy star body combined with the sword and slashed out with the strongest sword.</p><p>This sword seemed to be able to cut down the stars in the sky, hence its name, star slashing sword.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cast his strongest attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two beams of light collided in the sky like a sun exploding. It was a terrifying scene.</p><p>The endless storm and Qi fell down.</p><p>The true Yuan that the peak-tier Kings had laid down started to shake violently, and the expressions of the peak-tier Kings changed as they were forced back.</p><p>On the high platform, mu Tian’s eyes flickered. With a wave of his hand, a wave of true Yuan spread out and covered the true Yuan of more than a dozen peak-tier Kings. Only then did it block the overflowing energy from above.</p><p>After the explosion, the two figures quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters, while the Holy constellation retreated about five hundred meters. It was clear who was stronger.</p><p>The two of them faced each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re pretty strong, but it’s all over for today.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, an even stronger aura burst out of his body.</p><p>He was much stronger than before.</p><p>heavens, the Holy constellation is actually still hiding its strength!</p><p>“This is a special use of a special bloodline. Everyone’s bloodline contains endless mysteries. Ordinary people can only use their bloodline to increase their combat power, but some geniuses can comprehend some mysterious things from their bloodline, such as martial techniques or secret techniques! That’s the kind of person Holy constellation is!”</p><p>Lu Ming is finished. He’s even less of a match!</p><p>Cries of surprise came from the surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Previously, Qin Qingshan had done the same. He had almost turned himself into an Ice Man, which had greatly increased his combat strength. That was also a secret skill that he had comprehended from his bloodline.</p><p>Until now, Lu Ming had not comprehended anything from the blood Meridian.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons could devour all things. It could also be said to be a secret skill that one would possess upon awakening.</p><p>As for his second bloodline, it had always been obscured by a layer of clouds. Now, he could only see the word ‘suppress’. It was as if there was something blocking it. Lu Ming could not observe it at all, let alone comprehend it.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Below, Mu Lan had a worried look on her face as she clutched her clothes tightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this battle is over!”</p><p>The Holy star stepped on the air, its aura thick and powerful.</p><p>“Is it really over? Yes, it’s time to end this!”</p><p>“It seems like I still have to use that power!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly and sighed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming’s aura burst out and rose rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura was wild!</p><p>Everyone present was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s aura has increased too. Oh my God!”</p><p>and the increase is so rapid. It’s even more than the increase of the sacred constellation. How terrifying!</p><p>Sensing the violent essential core in his body, Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>This was the explosive power of the dandan inscription formation.</p><p>Earlier on, Lu Ming had been suppressing the essential core in his body, keeping it at Lu Ming’s original strength. He wanted to see how far his own strength was from the sacred constellation.</p><p>The sacred constellation was indeed stronger than Qin Qingshan.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The people from the Sheng family, Sheng Xingchen’s mother, mu Yi, and the others all cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“This guy is forever unfathomable!”</p><p>Mu Lan let out a breath and smiled.</p><p>Mu Xiu Yuan and mu Zheng were also the same.</p><p>Holy constellation’s eyes suddenly narrowed, and a hint of disbelief flashed through them.</p><p>“Sacred constellation, it’s time to end this battle! Battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, stepping on the void and slowly walking out.</p><p>With every step he took, the void trembled violently. The power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst out.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The Holy stars exploded, and the Battle Sword was incomparably fierce, as if it could split open space.</p><p>Lu Ming’s first step was easily broken, but the second step’s power swarmed in.</p><p>When the Holy star broke through the power of the second step, his expression changed slightly. He felt great pressure, but immediately, the power of the third step arrived.</p><p>The third step was even stronger, several times stronger than the second step.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The Holy star roared and slashed out with its sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a huge boom, Holy constellation’s body shook violently and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar. Sheng Xingchen had retreated, and he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm, had actually managed to force the sacred constellation into a disadvantageous position.</p><p>no, no, constellation can’t lose. That little bastard, he deserves to die, he deserves to die!</p><p>Mu Qing of the sacred constellation screamed with resentment.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Holy star let out a long cry, its hair flying in the air, and its Starlight boiling.</p><p>He could not stand being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Your fate has already been decided!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and strode forward.</p><p>“Brat, let’s stop here. It’s enough for today’s battle. Next, let’s pretend to lose to sacred constellation!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned for a moment, then he sneered. It seemed that someone could not sit still.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept around.</p><p>“Kid, you don’t have to look anymore. I’m Saint constellation’s uncle. I’ll be frank with you. Saint constellation’s status isn’t something you can compare with. He’s not only a member of the Sheng clan, but also the bloodline of my Shang clan. You can’t defeat him. Today, the one who wins must be Saint constellation!”</p><p>“If you defeat him, I guarantee that you will die!”</p><p>That voice rang out again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the high platform. Finally, his gaze landed on a middle-aged man with a Jade crown on his head.</p><p>This person was Saint Xingchen’s uncle, Shangguan wuchen.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Laughable, truly laughable!</p><p>Seeing that sacred constellation was at a disadvantage, someone jumped out and actually wanted him to lose to sacred constellation on purpose.</p><p>The reason was that the Holy star had some Bullsh * t Shangguan clan’s bloodline, and that her status was higher than his!</p><p>Otherwise, Lu Ming would have to die!</p><p>Lu Ming had never heard of such a ridiculous thing. It was simply despicable and shameless.</p><p>Lu Ming would listen to him?</p><p>Obviously not.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the Spear’s gleam intensified. He used his actions to announce that he would not compromise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
