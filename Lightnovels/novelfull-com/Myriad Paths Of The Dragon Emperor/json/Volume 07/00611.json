I’ve seen everything I need to see. I’ll leave in a bit!</p><p>Yan kuangtu looked at Lu Ming with anticipation in his eyes.”I’ll be waiting for you in the main palace for the battle of Providence!”</p><p>“The battle of karmic luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t know about the war of karmic luck?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>“I’ve heard of it, but I don’t know the details!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He had heard feixue mention it before.</p><p>Lu Ming, the battle of Providence is of utmost importance. All the geniuses of the eastern barren territory will participate, including the demons. Not only can they help their forces to obtain boundless Providence, but they can also help themselves to obtain great Providence. With your talent, it’s not impossible for you to stand out in the battle of Providence. Back then, it was because I participated in the battle of Providence that I achieved what I have today.</p><p>Yan kuangtu explained.</p><p>“You can actually fight for luck?” Lu Ming was somewhat shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t fate just like luck, something that was born naturally? It was so mysterious, how could they still fight for it?</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu nodded and said, ” there’s a saying that goes,’man is the master of fate.’ Luck is also up to people to grasp. Therefore, luck can also be fought for. Talent, hard work, resources, and perseverance are all important to a warrior. But luck is just as important!</p><p>only those with great luck can become the strongest. Your luck isn’t weak, but if you don’t participate in the battle of luck, you’ll be pulled apart by the other geniuses. From then on, you’ll be reduced to a foil. You won’t be able to become a bright star of this era, and it’ll be difficult for you to become the strongest person on the continent.</p><p>so this time, all the geniuses of the East continent will participate. No one will miss it!</p><p>“The battle of karmic luck?”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation but he was a little hesitant.</p><p>They had to go to the headquarters of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace because of the battle of Providence, which was too close to Di Yi and Martial Emperor. Would the nine Dragon bloodline be sensed?</p><p>Also, if he represented the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the battle, it would be equivalent to helping the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to fight for the great fortune. He would definitely be unwilling to accept this.</p><p>Luck was also extremely important to a large force.</p><p>If a force was lucky enough, it could recruit more geniuses as its disciples, and the next generation would have more and more powerhouses, and their strength would become stronger and stronger.</p><p>Sooner or later, Lu Ming would have to stand against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. He did not want to help the Empyrean heaven divine Palace increase their luck.</p><p>Lu Ming, there are still two years before the battle of Providence. You must improve your strength as soon as possible in these two years. I’ll be waiting for you in the main palace!</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s figure flickered, and he disappeared in an instant.</p><p>The divine dragon’s head could be seen but its tail could not be seen.</p><p>“The battle of karmic luck?”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated this sentence, his eyes revealing a look of deep thought.</p><p>I’ll participate. I’ll definitely participate. Retreating isn’t my martial Dao. I don’t have much time left. My cultivation and martial Dao can only advance courageously if I have an intense collision with all the geniuses in the world. My cultivation can only improve faster.</p><p>if I retreat and hide in a place to practice, my martial arts will improve very slowly. When the ten years are up, I will still have to face Martial Emperor Di Yi. I might as well give it a try!</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming’s eyes emitted a strong fighting spirit and a firm will.</p><p>He decided to participate in the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>&Nbsp; he might have a lot of resources and a pile of intent crystals, allowing his cultivation to rise extremely quickly.</p><p>That was for the martial King realm. After breaking through to the sea of soul realm, the resources needed would be even more terrifying. His current resources were simply not enough.</p><p>The higher one’s realm was, the more difficult it would be to raise one’s cultivation. The resources required would be even more terrifying.</p><p>He wouldn’t be blinded by such a small achievement.</p><p>After making up his mind, Lu Ming no longer felt any pressure. He only had an indomitable will.</p><p>Then, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>A day later, in a Hall of the Sheng family, Sheng Cang, Sheng Xingchen, Shangguan Wu Chen, and Shangguan Wu Ling were sitting.</p><p>After two days of recuperation, Holy constellation’s injuries had recovered a lot and were almost completely healed.</p><p>damn it! That little bastard deserves to die! And that Yan kuangtu, he deserves to die too!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling shrieked, her killing intent soaring.</p><p>She had actually been slapped by Yan kuangtu in public. This almost drove her mad, and her killing intent was incomparably strong.</p><p>little sister, Yan kuangtu is not someone we can provoke. Even the old ancestor is no match for him. It’s best not to say such things!</p><p>On the side, Shangguan wuchen said.</p><p>“Second brother, are we just going to let this matter go?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling said.</p><p>“Of course not. We can’t deal with Yan kuangtu, but we can’t let that little b * stard Lu Ming off!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Yes, yes, it’s all that little bastard’s fault. It’s all his fault. If it weren’t for him, things wouldn’t have turned out this way.”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling was filled with killing intent. Since she could not deal with Yan Kuang tu, she could only direct all her anger onto Lu Ming.</p><p>the battle of Providence is in two years. At that time, we’ll have plenty of opportunities to kill that little bastard!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen said coldly. He then looked at the sacred constellation and said, ” Xingchen, come with me to the main palace to cultivate. It’s best if you take revenge personally and behead Lu Ming!</p><p>“I will. I will personally cut off his head!”</p><p>Holy constellation’s eyes were extremely cold, and he clenched his fists.</p><p>let’s go to the main palace together. The battle of karmic luck is in two years. We’ll definitely have to go.</p><p>Sheng Cang said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go to the main palace together!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen nodded.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three days that he had agreed to meet with elder Huang had arrived. Lu Ming left the courtyard and headed to elder Huang’s residence.</p><p>“Elder Huang!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out softly as he walked into the courtyard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming and said, ” “Lu Ming, you’re here. The long spear that you wanted has been refined. Take a look!”</p><p>Elder Huang took out a long spear and threw it to Lu Ming, who caught it.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming caught it and felt that it was extremely heavy. The weight was more than one million catties.</p><p>Of course, with Lu Ming’s current strength, he did not feel any pressure when he used it.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look.</p><p>The blood-red spearhead was made of indestructible steel. It had distinct edges and was filled with an indestructible feeling.</p><p>The body of the spear was dark red and was made of thousand refined blood gold. There were some strange patterns carved on it.</p><p>There were also some black dots scattered all over the spear.</p><p>Lu Ming fell in love with it at one glance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming injected his essential core and waved the long spear slightly. The long spear vibrated, stirring up a wave of air.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the tip of the spear is made of indestructible fine steel and is sturdy and immortal. The body of the spear is mainly made of thousand refined blood gold which contains Infinite Black Gold. In the future, as long as you have precious metals, you can refine them into the spear and it will continue to evolve into a higher grade spirit weapon!”</p><p>Old Huang looked at the spirit weapon and was a little proud, but also a little regretful. it’s a pity that my inscription technique can only stop here. This one is the limit of upper Lv 6, but I can’t go any further. What a pity!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
