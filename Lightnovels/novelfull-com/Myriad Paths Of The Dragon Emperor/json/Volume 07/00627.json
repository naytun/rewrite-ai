The runes flew into the pill furnace and disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>“Such exquisite inscription techniques!”</p><p>On the square, Yun Haitang’s eyes lit up again.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his attention and runes flew into the furnace. After a while, there was no longer any medicinal fragrance coming from the furnace.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Then, he opened the furnace, took out the elixir, and placed it on a Jade plate.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and realized that the others had also started to open their furnaces to take out pills.</p><p>“Haha, this is the pill you made? what kind of dog shit is this? No one would even pick it up if it was thrown on the road!”</p><p>At this moment, a sneer was heard. Gu Huaxu walked towards Lu Ming with a Jade plate on which the pills he had refined were on.</p><p>He looked at the pills on Lu Ming’s Jade plate with disdain and said sarcastically, the color is uneven. It’s obvious that you’ve placed the spirit medicine at the wrong time. Also, what the hell is this? there’s not a single inscription on the pill, and there’s no medicinal fragrance coming from it. This is clearly a useless pill. Haha, don’t tell me you don’t even know how to write an inscription!</p><p>Gu Huaxu laughed and revealed a look of disdain.</p><p>His laughter attracted the attention of the people around him. They all looked at Lu Ming’s pill.</p><p>as expected, there’s not a single inscription on it and there’s no medicinal fragrance at all. It’s indeed a useless pill. This person doesn’t know how to refine pills at all. What is he doing here? ”</p><p>he’s probably some hedonistic son of some family. He’s like a Toad lusting after swan meat and wants to pursue Haitang!</p><p>tsk, I’ve seen many people like this. How could Haitang take a fancy to such a person? ”</p><p>The people around them looked at Lu Ming’s pills and started whispering.</p><p>“Young master Gu, this person is obviously a popinjay who doesn’t know how to refine pills. How can he be compared to young master Gu?”</p><p>that’s right. Look at young master Gu’s elixirs. They are round and full, with even colors. The inscriptions are exquisite, and the medicinal fragrance is strong. They are obviously the top grade Lv 2 elixirs. No one in this group can compare with young master Gu!</p><p>Beside Gu Huaxu, a few young men started to flatter him.</p><p>Although they were flattering him, they were right. The PEI Yuan pill that Gu Huaxu refined was indeed the best.</p><p>When the surrounding people saw Gu Huaxu’s pills, they all shook their heads and sighed. They couldn’t compare to Gu Huaxu’s pills at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, ignore them!”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked over and looked at Lu Ming’s pill.</p><p>Her opinion was similar to the others. However, she knew that Lu Ming had only been in contact with the Dao of inscription for a few months. It was normal for him to refine a useless pill.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s main focus was on cultivating martial arts.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled. He did not say much.</p><p>“Alright, bring out your pills and sign your names!”</p><p>Yun Haitang ordered.</p><p>Everyone took the refined pills and put them into a Jade bottle, then signed their names on the label of the Jade bottle.</p><p>alright, today, you will follow Deacon suifeng and find your own dormitory. Tomorrow morning, you will gather here!</p><p>Yun Haitang said.</p><p>After that, everyone followed the middle-aged man and went to find their own accommodation.</p><p>After the crowd left, Yun Haitang took out a Jade bottle immediately. The name on the bottle was Lu Ming.</p><p>Yun Haitang poured out the pills that Lu Ming had refined and observed them carefully.</p><p>Haitang, this is clearly a useless pill. What is there to see? ”</p><p>The two old men at the side said.</p><p>“A useless pill? Uncles, this time, you’ve misjudged!”</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled slightly, and a look of surprise flashed in her eyes.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The two elders were a little puzzled. They observed the pills that Lu Ming refined in detail.</p><p>After taking a closer look, the two old men’s expressions changed. They became a little solemn, and slowly, their solemn expressions turned into shock.</p><p>“What a brilliant inscription technique, and what a pure pill!”</p><p>The two old men exclaimed in unison.</p><p>uncles, I’m sure you can tell that the color of this pill is not well-proportioned on the surface. The timing of adding the spiritual herbs was not particularly precise. However, the pill is extremely pure and has almost no impurities. This means that the person who refined the pill has an extraordinary mental energy fire that can burn all the impurities and extract them.</p><p>also, this person’s inscription technique is extremely exquisite. It’s completely hidden under the surface of the pill, and can’t be seen from the outside. However, he has fused the pill perfectly and completely locked the medicinal effect. That’s why there’s no medicinal fragrance coming out.</p><p>After saying that, a green flame appeared between Yun Haitang’s fingers. A green flame represented a fifth-level Alchemist.</p><p>Yun Haitang was only in her twenties, but she had already become a fifth-level Alchemist. It was shocking.</p><p>The green mental energy fire flowed across the surface of the pill. Inscriptions appeared on the surface of the pill, intertwining with each other in a harmonious and beautiful manner.</p><p>The two old men’s eyes widened, and their surprise became even stronger.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is interesting!”</p><p>A strange smile appeared on Yun Haitang’s face, and there seemed to be a hint of greed in her smile.</p><p>As for the other pills, Yun Haitang didn’t even look at them. She was not interested.</p><p>The cloud Sea elixir dispensary was huge. Everyone had their own small courtyard, and the environment was not bad.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in his room in the courtyard. He activated the meditation and began to cultivate his mental energy fire.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming’s cultivation base had already reached a bottleneck while the Dragon God’s three absolutes had been cultivated to perfection. As for the fifth step of the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, it was too difficult and could not be achieved in a short time.</p><p>The power of the fifth step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps was equivalent to the sixth stage of a low-grade demigod martial technique. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Martial techniques above the heaven level, even at the demigod level, were also divided into low-grade and high-grade.</p><p>Only after the demigod level was the God level.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming spent more time on cultivating the inscription Dao.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</p><p>The next day, everyone gathered in the square again.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing came together. Soon, hundreds of people had arrived.</p><p>In the sky, two figures stepped through the air.</p><p>A man and a woman.</p><p>The woman was naturally Yun Haitang.</p><p>The man was about 25 or 26 years old. He was very handsome, and there was a faint arrogance on his face. He came side by side with Yun Haitang and landed in the sky above the square.</p><p>that’s the other peerless genius of the cloud Sea alchemy institution, Yun congsheng. He’s extremely powerful in both alchemy and martial arts. He’s the second most talented person in the cloud Sea alchemy institution, only Yun Haitang!</p><p>furthermore, his father is the head of the Yun family, a sea of soul realm expert!</p><p>he’s so handsome and has a good background. He’s handsome and talented. If I can marry him, my life will be worth it.</p><p>A young woman said as if she was smitten.</p><p>“Everyone!”</p><p>Yun Haitang called out, and the crowd quieted down.</p><p>I’ve seen all the pills you made yesterday. Sure enough, some of you are very good at alchemy. Even Haitang admires you. I don’t dare to teach you. This time, we’re mainly exchanging ideas and improving each other!</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled and continued, ” this time, Haitang has decided that the one with the best alchemy skills can enter Haitang’s courtyard at any time and discuss alchemy with her!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
