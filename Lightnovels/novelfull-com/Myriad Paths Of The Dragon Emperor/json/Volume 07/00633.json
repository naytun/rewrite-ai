Then, he followed the maidservant and headed to Begonia courtyard.</p><p>Begonia courtyard was located on another mountain peak with beautiful scenery. Although it was a courtyard, it was built in a luxurious way and occupied a large area.</p><p>It could be said that this entire mountain peak was Begonia courtyard’s territory.</p><p>There were even stone palaces built in the middle of the mountain.</p><p>The maidservant led Lu Ming around the place and arrived at a Stone Hall.</p><p>This stone Palace was built in the middle of the mountain, so light couldn’t directly shine in. The walls of the stone Palace were inlaid with some luminous stones, making the stone Palace look hazy.</p><p>In the stone Hall, there was a Jade table and a few Jade stools.</p><p>On the Jade table, there were already some spirit fruits, wine, and food.</p><p>After the maidservant brought Lu Ming here, she left, leaving him alone in the stone Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings with great interest. Then, he picked up his glass, poured himself a glass of wine, and finished it in one gulp.</p><p>“Good wine!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh in admiration. This wine was rich in taste. After it entered his stomach, he felt warm all over and it had an endless aftertaste.</p><p>“Since it’s good wine, brother Lu must drink a few more cups today!”</p><p>A sweet voice was heard, and Yun Haitang walked in.</p><p>Today, Yun Haitang was wearing a black gauze dress and looked very beautiful.</p><p>To be honest, Yun Haitang’s figure was extremely impressive and was only slightly inferior to Mu Lan’s. Any man would be tempted.</p><p>Lu Ming was a normal man.</p><p>Yun Haitang sat on the stone bench next to Lu Ming and smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I gave you the right to come to Begonia courtyard to find me at any time, but you didn’t come after such a long time, and even asked this little sister to send someone to invite you. That’s not very kind of you, you must drink three cups as a punishment!”</p><p>Yun Haitang poured a glass of wine for Lu Ming. She smiled sweetly and her voice was so sweet that it could penetrate one’s heart.</p><p>“Alright, you deserve to be punished!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, picked up the glass of wine, and drank it in one go.</p><p>Then, Yun Haitang poured another glass of wine for Lu Ming. Just like that, Lu Ming drank three glasses in a row.</p><p>I’m really impressed by brother Lu’s Dao of inscription. I feel that even though you’re only a third-rank Alchemist, your spiritual power should be on par with some fourth-rank alchemists. Could it be that you’ve lit five spiritual lamps at every rank? ”</p><p>Yun Haitang blinked her big eyes and stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. not bad. I’m lucky to have lit up five mental lamps in the first two levels.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming said this, Yun Haitang’s eyes suddenly lit up. There was a flash of greed in the depths of her eyes.</p><p>brother Lu’s talent is really admirable. Come, let me toast you!</p><p>Yun Haitang picked up the glass and drank it all.</p><p>After drinking the glass of wine, Yun Haitang’s face immediately flushed red, making her look even more alluring.</p><p>At this moment, a maidservant hurriedly walked in.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s face immediately darkened. “Can’t you see that I’m drinking with young master Lu? What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Miss!”</p><p>The maidservant’s face paled, and a hint of fear appeared on her face. However, she still walked over and whispered a few words into Yun Haitang’s ear.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s expression changed slightly. “You may leave!”</p><p>The maidservant immediately took her leave.</p><p>brother Lu, I have a small matter to deal with. Wait for me here!</p><p>Yun Haitang said in a sweet voice.</p><p>alright, it’s fine. Haitang, please do as you please!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Yun Haitang stood up and left.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the glass of wine and took another sip. Then, he stood up and started to inscribe in the air with his hands. Runes appeared one after another and entered his body.</p><p>This was an inscription formation that had been inscribed before to conceal one’s aura. Although this formation wasn’t very advanced, it had a unique effect in concealing one’s aura.</p><p>According to dandan, this was its own creation. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, even a sea of soul realm expert would not be able to sense his aura.</p><p>Runes appeared on Lu Ming’s body and disappeared in a flash. The aura on Lu Ming’s body also disappeared without a trace. It was much more effective than him circulating his cultivation to hide his aura.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming moved and left the stone Hall. He passed through several corridors and secret rooms before he saw another Stone Hall. A voice came from the stone Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed into the stone Hall silently and hid in a corner.</p><p>This Stone Hall was even bigger than the one Lu Ming had been in earlier. A young man was sitting at a table with Yun Haitang.</p><p>Haitang, I haven’t seen you in a while. I’ve missed you so much. You see, I came to see you as soon as I finished my business.</p><p>The young man looked at Yun Haitang, his eyes burning with anger.</p><p>“You really missed me? You’re not allowed to lie to me!”</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled and poured the young man a cup of wine.</p><p>of course it’s true. Sigh, if it weren’t for the problem with my cultivation of mental fire recently, not only not making any progress, but also constantly regressing, I really don’t want to leave. I want to stay here and accompany you!</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Your family’s elders didn’t find out the reason for your mental fire’s regression?”</p><p>Yun Haitang’s eyes flashed as she asked in a sweet voice.</p><p>“No, it’s really strange!”</p><p>The young man mumbled. Then, his eyes fell on Yun Haitang with a burning desire. I don’t care. If my mental fire has regressed, so be it. As long as Haitang is here, even if I can’t cultivate, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>As he spoke, the young man put his arm around Yun Haitang. The two of them were entangled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He did not expect to encounter such a scene when he came to check on the situation.</p><p>To be honest, this was the first time Lu Ming had seen such a situation. He touched his nose and watched with great interest.</p><p>The young man’s breathing became heavier and heavier. A moment later, the young man let out a low roar like a wild beast.</p><p>At this moment, a scene that shocked Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>Three green spirit lamps appeared above the young man’s head. On them were green spirit Fire.</p><p>This meant that the young man was a level four inscriber.</p><p>Above Yun Haitang’s head, a spirit lamp also appeared.</p><p>There were five green spirit lamps. But at this time, Yun Haitang’s Spirit Fire had actually gathered into a poisonous snake. It opened its mouth and sucked. The young man’s Spirit Fire was absorbed by the poisonous snake and turned into Yun Haitang’s Spirit Fire.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
