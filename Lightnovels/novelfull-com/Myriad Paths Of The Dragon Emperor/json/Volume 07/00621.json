Why are there Supreme-grade and peerless-grade ones?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of this problem.</p><p>Bullsh * t, that’s because those inscription Masters are useless. They can only make top grade weapons. That’s why I said that your spear is a waste. If you let that old man make it, he can only make top grade Lv 6 weapons. If it were a true inscription master, he could at least make Supreme grade weapons.</p><p>Dandan said with disdain.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Suddenly, his expression changed.”Someone’s coming down, we should leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that someone was coming down from above.</p><p>After the earth core flowing flame was absorbed by Lu Ming, the heat disappeared. The heaven and earth spiritual energy in the earth cave was dozens of times richer than before. Naturally, it aroused the curiosity of others and it was normal for them to come down to explore.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to cause a commotion and had no intention of showing himself. His figure flashed, turning into a ray of light and rushing upward.</p><p>He walked past a few young men, but they did not notice him at all.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming exited the earth Aeon cave and arrived at the palace where he found the flower Pool.</p><p>He then told Hua Chi about the earth cave.</p><p>When Hua Chi heard this, he was stunned. Then, he was overjoyed.</p><p>There was actually a spiritual eye under the earth cave. With this as a Foundation, the blazing sun Empire would definitely have more and more experts in the future, and its National Strength would also become stronger.</p><p>Hua Chi immediately sent experts to seal the earth cave and then considered how to use it.</p><p>Lu Ming chatted with Hua Chi for a while and left him some pills and secret manuals. Then, he left the imperial capital and returned to the Lu family.</p><p>From then on, Lu Ming’s daily schedule was packed.</p><p>Apart from comprehending the Thunder mentality and cultivating the Dragon God’s three unique skills, he practiced inscription, the underworld God visualization, and improving his Spirit Fire.</p><p>Time flew by, and two months had passed.</p><p>It had been almost three months since the great battle with the sacred constellation.</p><p>In the past two months, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>The Dragon God’s three absolutes had already reached perfection and had been cultivated to the sixth level.</p><p>He had also cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to the fourth step. Its power was equivalent to the sixth level of the heaven-level superior-grade martial technique, which was equivalent to the sixth level of the Dragon God’s three absolutes.</p><p>In addition, the three types of heaven and earth concepts were all at the great circle of level one. Lu Ming’s current combat strength was several times stronger than when he was fighting against the sacred constellation.</p><p>Now, when he was up against the Holy star, even without the help of the inscription formation, Lu Ming could easily defeat the Holy star.</p><p>Of course, the sacred constellation would also improve and not remain stagnant. This was another matter.</p><p>As for the Thunder concept, it had also improved greatly and was infinitely close to level two.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to break through to the second rank. It could not be done in a short time.</p><p>There was a huge chasm between the first level intent realm and the second level intent realm, and it was very difficult to cross.</p><p>The fastest improvement was still the Dao of inscription.</p><p>After two months of cultivation, Lu Ming had successfully lit up another spirit lamp. Seven yellow flames of the spirit color were burning fiercely. He was about to light up the eighth lamp.</p><p>However, at every level, the higher the level, the harder it was to light up the spirit lamp. The first few spirit lamps were the easiest to light up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed of inscribing inscriptions had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>On a mountain peak a few hundred miles away from fiery wind city, Lu Ming had been cultivating the Dao of inscription on this mountain peak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he stomped on the mountain peak. With every step he took, runes would appear, emitting a bright light.</p><p>“Abnormal, abnormal, in a short two months, he has actually cultivated inscription to this level, this abnormal!”</p><p>On a bluestone at the side, dandan was lazily lying on the bluestone mountain, basking in the sun. She was still chewing a spirit herb in her mouth, and as she chewed, she was wailing in her heart.</p><p>After two months, Lu Ming had finally reached the stage where he could inscribe inscriptions with his hands and feet.</p><p>If it were anyone else, without ten to twenty years of bitter cultivation, it was absolutely impossible. No wonder dandan was wailing endlessly.</p><p>kid, you’ve barely passed the test after cultivating to this stage. When you become a fifth-rank inscriber and your spiritual power can communicate with the power of heaven and earth, you’ll be able to burst out with a terrifying attack.</p><p>She would not admit that Lu Ming was perverted and would attack him.</p><p>Otherwise, how could it maintain its lofty status?</p><p>However, it had never been high and mighty in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over, pinched dandan’s head, and threw it on his shoulder.</p><p>“Ah, ah, kid, if you dare to pinch my head again, I’m not done with you, I’m not done with you.”</p><p>Dandan shouted hysterically.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and rose into the air, preparing to return to the Lu family.</p><p>At this moment, a strong sense of danger spread from his heart. His skin instantly tightened.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>In the sky, countless wind blades cut through the air and fell down on him. They were extremely sharp.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any hesitation, he used his three intents and true essence. Hundreds of spear lights shot out and clashed with the wind blades.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, the sound of explosions rang out and the force shot out in all directions, destroying the mountain forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a huge black wind blade fell from the sky.</p><p>Wherever the wind blade passed, the space trembled violently, splitting apart like water waves.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and a three-colored true dragon flew out, clashing with the huge wind blade.</p><p>The space trembled, and the wind blade and the three-colored true dragon disappeared.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had not broken through to the peak-tier King level, his combat strength was definitely unrivaled among Kings. Now, the person above his head actually had combat strength that was not weaker than his.</p><p>Could it be a great expert of the spiritual ocean tier?</p><p>No, he didn’t feel the boundless aura of the spiritual ocean tier, so he shouldn’t be in the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Who’s there? You’re so sneaky, get out here!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a Spear’s gleam and rushed upwards. He thrust his spear forward and a dazzling Spear’s gleam soared into the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space trembled. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force acting on his body. It was as if his weight had suddenly increased by tens or even hundreds of times.</p><p>But it was different from gravity.</p><p>Lu Ming felt immense pressure on his body.</p><p>He seemed to be stuck in a quagmire.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>All around him, the sound of air being torn apart rang out. Countless wind blades cut through the air and slashed at him.</p><p>No, this wasn’t a type of wind blade. Although it was similar, it was more wondrous and more dangerous than wind blades.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. The aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming did not use his full strength.</p><p>His true essence circulated rapidly, and three intents wrapped around his body.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned upside down and took four steps forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The heavens and earth went berserk, and the space trembled. Lu Ming broke through the terrifying pressure. He rushed into the sky and pointed his long spear.</p><p>On a cloud, a graceful figure stood facing the wind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
