The trees here were extremely strange. They were dark red in color and were completely different from the trees that Lu Ming had seen before.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming did not have the time to think. He took out a pile of top-grade spirit crystals and started to recover his essential core after devouring them.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming’s essential core had recovered.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed as he looked at the sky.</p><p>More than 20 people have flown over here and landed. They are all from the chaotic Astral Ocean like him.</p><p>These people were basically all peak-tier Kings. They had only managed to break out of the encirclement and come here. However, each of them had suffered injuries of varying degrees.</p><p>They naturally saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was dressed the same as them, Fenfen heaved a huge sigh of relief. A few of them stood guard while the rest recuperated.</p><p>Lu Ming did not speak. He sat cross-legged not far away, but his mind was constantly thinking.</p><p>What was this place? And who were the people who attacked them? He seemed to be dressed in ancient clothes and was actually wearing animal skin.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, Lu Ming had heard that only tribes in extremely remote areas would wear animal skins.</p><p>Most importantly, those people could actually refine runes and make puppets. This was strange.</p><p>Runes and puppets were both branches of the Dao of inscription. Just like inscription runes scroll, only true inscription blacksmiths could create them.</p><p>There were actually many true inscription refiners among these humans who were dressed like primitive tribes?</p><p>An hour or two later, the twenty-odd people had almost recovered.</p><p>“Everyone, do you know who those people are? And what is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>during the battle just now, I thought I heard someone call us extraterrestrials. Is this place really underground? ”</p><p>A rather refined middle-aged man muttered.</p><p>“Underground? it can’t really be underground, right? There’s a world underground?”</p><p>Some people were very surprised.</p><p>The others didn’t make a sound, but they knew in their hearts that it was most likely true. When they came in earlier, they had kept falling, and they didn’t know how far they had fallen.</p><p>if it’s really underground, then we’re in trouble. How do we get out? ”</p><p>Someone said worriedly.</p><p>since we came in through the entrance of the Martial Emperor’s treasure, we can definitely get out. But first, we have to figure out the situation here!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, this little brother is right!”</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He looked at the sky and his expression changed. not good, those people are chasing us. Let’s go!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>The others were slightly stunned and turned their heads to look. Sure enough, they saw hundreds of giant wolves in the distant sky. They spread their wings and flew over at high speed.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically, and they rose into the air one after another, flying forward wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast. He shook off the puppet wolves and landed ten thousand miles away.</p><p>This time, he landed in a Valley. As for the middle-aged man and the others, they had already separated from him.</p><p>However, a few hours later, the giant wolf puppet actually caught up with them again.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why do those people know where I am and can accurately find me every time?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows as he pondered. He flew forward at high speed and soon, he shook off the giant wolves and landed in a forest.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings carefully. Suddenly, his eyes flickered and he drew in the air. Runes appeared and landed on an ancient tree.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared on the ancient tree, forming a mysterious inscription formation.</p><p>as expected, there are arrays everywhere in the forest. These arrays should be used for surveillance. They can detect the aura of people nearby and lock their position!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and had an answer in his heart.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, let’s break these formations!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and the inscription formation on the ancient tree trembled before it collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming wandered around the area and found many of such inscription arrays. All of them were destroyed.</p><p>After breaking the array in this area, Lu Ming took a rest in this area. As expected, after a long time, no one came after him.</p><p>“Where should I go next? Could it be that the Martial Emperor’s treasure is only used to lure people in and has no other purpose?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled. He felt that this matter was very strange.</p><p>That’s because the entrance to the chaotic Astral Ocean was definitely set up by someone outside. Therefore, there’s definitely a purpose for it. Perhaps, the real Martial Emperor’s treasure is hidden in this underground world.</p><p>I’d better figure out a way to understand the distribution of the underground world first. It’d be best if I could blend in. Only then will I know what to do next!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was making conjectures, there was a huge ancient city more than a hundred thousand miles away. This ancient city was basically built with stones. The city walls were made of stone, and so were the buildings in the city.</p><p>In the middle of the ancient city, there was a huge stone Hall. At this moment, a group of people was discussing something.</p><p>Most of them were old men, and they were all wearing animal skins. At this moment, a burly man was reporting to the old men.</p><p>“A person from the outer world, could he really be a person from the outer world?”</p><p>A chubby old man muttered to himself as he frowned.</p><p>could it be that the ancient legend is true? when the people from the outer realm descend, there will definitely be a Son of heaven’s will who can revive the ancient ancestor and once again teach the great Dao to the major tribes? ”</p><p>legends don’t come from nowhere. Every tribe has such a legend. Whoever can find the chosen one and revive the ancient ancestor will be highly valued by the ancient ancestor and be taught Supreme techniques!</p><p>One by one, the elders expressed their opinions.</p><p>this is a chance for us, the heavenly Wolf tribe. Pass down my order. We can only capture the extraterrestrials alive. If it is not necessary, we can not kill them. We must capture more extraterrestrials than the other tribes.</p><p>The oldest man said.</p><p>“Yes, clan elder!”</p><p>The burly man accepted the order and left.</p><p>“The chosen one must be in the hands of the heavenly Wolf tribe!”</p><p>The celestial Wolf elder’s murky eyes shone with a light that was brighter than the stars.</p><p>……</p><p>After resting for a while, Lu Ming continued to move. He randomly chose a direction and continued to fly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After Lu Ming had flown a few thousand miles away, two fist gleams suddenly shot toward him from below. The power was terrifying.</p><p>“Zhong Mo!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He took four consecutive steps with the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, and the world rumbled. He blocked the two fist radiance, but Lu Ming’s body was sent flying into the sky by the huge force.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming flew up for a thousand meters before he stopped. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and his legs were trembling.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The burly man from the blood poison sect followed closely behind the fist radiance. With a roar and a tidal wave of killing intent, he threw two more punches at Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming at lightning speed so that he would not have time to escape.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw dozens of punches in a row. Dozens of fist gleams collided in front of him. After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s exploding star fist had reached the sixth level.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian burst out and he thrust his spear forward with greater power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
