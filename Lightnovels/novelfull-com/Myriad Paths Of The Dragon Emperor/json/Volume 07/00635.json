Since you’ve returned so quickly, why don’t you take the opportunity to get closer to a beauty?”</p><p>...</p><p>Xie nianqing mocked Lu Ming when he saw him.</p><p>“Why would I get close to other women? if I want to get close, I should get close to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face reddened. don’t give me that. Who would want to be close to you? tell me, did you have lustful thoughts about her and got chased out? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Was his character that bad?</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not say anything, Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>forget it, let’s not talk about it anymore. It’s more important to get down to business!</p><p>Lu Ming took out Yun Haitang’s storage ring and focused his mind on it. After a while, a token appeared.</p><p>“This is … An inscribed token? You’re taking action so quickly?” Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Of course, if you don’t do it now, I’m going to sacrifice my body!”</p><p>let’s take action now, ” Lu Ming mumbled. if we’re too late and others find out that Yun Haitang is in trouble, we won’t have a chance anymore!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was not one to hesitate and immediately nodded.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out. Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming in confusion.</p><p>“I’ll inscribe an inscription formation for you to conceal your aura first!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to inscribe runes on Xie nianqing’s body. After a while, the inscription array that concealed his aura was completed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect your inscription technique to be so brilliant!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“It’s nothing, it’s nothing. Let’s go!”</p><p>In a flash, he went into the depths of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy with Xie nianqing following behind.</p><p>At the same time, in a secret room of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, a deep roar like that of a beast was heard.</p><p>A white-haired old man’s heart was pierced through by Gu Huaxu.</p><p>“You … Who was it? Ancient flower void … Not this strong?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He was a core elder of the cloud Sea alchemy institution and a peak-tier King. Even if Gu Huaxu had sneaked an attack on him, he wouldn’t have been able to pierce through his heart.</p><p>The cultivation that Gu Huaxu had just revealed was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re about to die, why care so much? I only want your inscription plate!”</p><p>True Yuan exploded, and the old man’s aura was extinguished.</p><p>Gu Huaxu sneered and licked his lips. He took off the old man’s storage ring. After a while, a token appeared in his hand. It was exactly the same as the one that Lu Ming and the others had gotten from Yun Haitang.</p><p>Then, Gu Huaxu’s body flashed and he also headed towards the treasure vault of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s cultivation levels were high. Their movements were as fast as lightning. Coupled with the inscription array that concealed their aura, no one could discover them.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the depths of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. There was a huge mountain.</p><p>On the mountainside, there was a stone door. The stone door was tightly closed, and there was a large inscription formation engraved on all sides.</p><p>If they didn’t have the token, not to mention whether they could break in, if they tried to force their way in, it would alert the higher-ups of the cloud Sea alchemy institution, including that sea of soul realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing rushed to the mountainside, took out the inscription token, and injected their vital essence.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The inscription token glowed and inscriptions appeared on it. Inscriptions also appeared on the stone door. These inscriptions formed a light shield in front of them.</p><p>At this moment, the light barrier split into two, forming a door. The stone door opened automatically.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two of them flashed and rushed in.</p><p>The light shield closed automatically, and the stone door also closed.</p><p>Behind the stone door, there was a wide passage. It was obviously man-made, and the surrounding walls were full of holes.</p><p>The two of them followed the passageway and advanced quickly.</p><p>The tunnel slanted downward, leading to the underground.</p><p>The two of them ran forward carefully for a few minutes. Suddenly, Lu Ming felt his hair stand on end and a sense of danger erupted from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly pulled Xie nianqing and retreated.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Two sharp beams of Qi shot into the place where the two had been, leaving two deep, thumb-sized holes in the ground.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A figure pounced at them with dark green claws aimed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s vital points. The speed was unbelievable.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hands. The Spear’s gleam pierced through the void and stabbed forward.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his hand forward and a powerful force field burst out, enveloping the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear gleam collided with the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure swayed slightly, while the other party retreated rapidly.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. Under his and Xie nianqing’s combined attack, the other party was only pushed back and not injured. This showed the other party’s combat power.</p><p>Of course, it was also because the two of them were in a hurry and didn’t use their full strength.</p><p>“Gu Huaxu!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw the person in front of him. He was shocked and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Beside him, Xie nianqing was in the same state.</p><p>The person who had ambushed them was actually Gu Huaxu.</p><p>Half a month ago, Gu Huaxu was only at Lv 7 martial King realm. In just half a month, he had improved to such a terrifying level.</p><p>“Hehe, your battle strength is beyond my expectations!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu sneered and licked his lips. He stared at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing furrowed their brows. They did not expect to meet Gu Huaxu here.</p><p>“You’re also here to steal the treasures of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>hehe, not bad. I didn’t expect you to come in here. Good, I’ll take this opportunity to finish you off!</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s body flickered and turned into a dozen phantoms, charging toward Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Each Phantom looked real and exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>“Sky poison claw!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared as a claw light shot out.</p><p>More than a dozen figures attacked at the same time, their claws covering Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s vital points.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field! Sky demon cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as the sky demon force field exploded. It contained a terrifying cutting force.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear turned into more than ten spear gleams and pierced through more than ten phantoms.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a dozen or so deep explosions, Gu Huaxu’s dozen or so figures all collapsed and turned into one. He quickly retreated a hundred meters away, and blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>In the battle between the three of them, all of their true Qi was restrained. Otherwise, with their combat strength, if their Qi spread in all directions, it would probably penetrate the mountain.</p><p>I didn’t expect that your battle strength would reach such a level. I’m afraid that even the sovereigns at the bottom of the list of top 1000 talents are no match for either of you!</p><p>Gu Huaxu said with a serious expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
