It would be great if such a genius could be used by the flame Chamber of Commerce!</p><p>...</p><p>young lady, that’s impossible. These two are so young, but they’ve already reached the peak King realm. They must be the heirs of some big force. In a few years, they might even be on the list of top 1000 talents. Their future is limitless. How can our flame Chamber of Commerce invite such people? ”</p><p>The peak-tier King from the flame Chamber of Commerce walked to the side and said softly.</p><p>elder Wu, you think too highly of them. In my opinion, their combat strength is only average. My brother can definitely defeat them easily. They are just lucky to be born in a major power and rely on a large amount of resources to reach their cultivation base. There are many people like them in those major powers, so they will definitely not be able to get on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Chen Zhao walked up and sneered.</p><p>He was still very unhappy with Lu Ming.</p><p>Luo Xin sighed. Chen Zhao was too narrow-minded, he wouldn’t be able to do much.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing rose into the air and flew toward the Inland of golden sand island. Soon, a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The two of them flew toward the city.</p><p>This city was not guarded by anyone. People came and went, flying here and there, and it was very lively.</p><p>As Lu Ming and Xie nianqing approached the city gate, they immediately attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>Most of these gazes came from the burly men.</p><p>These people were all burly and strong. They didn’t even bother to hide their murderous aura as they stared at Xie nianqing with fiery eyes.</p><p>Not only were there middle-aged brawny men, but there were also a few white-haired old men. Their eyes were also burning as they looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. Xie nianqing’s charm was too great. He would attract attention wherever he went.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not stop others from watching. If someone wanted to take a step further, Lu Ming’s fist would have long been itching.</p><p>The two of them could not be bothered with the gazes from the surroundings and walked into the city.</p><p>In the city, the shops formed a forest and it was even more lively.</p><p>On both sides of the street, there were many stalls selling many strange things.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that there would be so many Warriors on golden sand island.”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming noticed that the quality of the Warriors on golden sand island was very high. There were almost no weaklings. Lu Ming took a glance and saw that most of them were at the level of martial Kings.</p><p>Of course, there were also Warriors below the rank of martial King, but they were all high-level martial arts grandmasters. The weaker ones did not dare to walk around.</p><p>It’s no wonder. In the entire Eastern wilderness, many of those extremely vicious and evil martial artists, or those who practice evil martial arts, come to the chaotic Astral Ocean. This has led to the chaotic Astral Ocean having an extremely large number of experts. The number of experts in the chaotic Astral Ocean far exceeds that of most big regions.</p><p>Martial Kings were everywhere.</p><p>“Kid, what the hell do you mean? I saw this piece of deep sea cold iron first. What’s the meaning of this? Do you want to die?”</p><p>“I think you’re the one who wants to die. So what if you like her? This piece of deep sea cold iron, I want it!”</p><p>In front of a stall, two big men in their forties started quarreling.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>With a loud roar, one of the burly men pulled out his saber and slashed at another man.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in the other man’s hand. The long spear turned into a flash of lightning and pierced the throat of the man in front.</p><p>The man roared and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re really looking for death. You still want to fight with the old man for the deep sea cold iron!”</p><p>The man with the long spear put away his spear and took the man’s storage ring before looking at the stall owner again.</p><p>“The deep sea cold iron is mine!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Alright!” The stall owner smiled and handed a piece of metal to the burly man. As for the death of one person, he did not find it strange at all.</p><p>The people around him were the same. They only took a casual glance and then went back to their own business as if this was a normal thing.</p><p>Not long after, a few Men in Black appeared and took the corpse away.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing took a few glances and continued walking.</p><p>old thief, you dare to touch my woman? die!</p><p>He had only taken a few steps when another loud roar rang out in front of him. A man in his thirties had split an old man in half with an axe.</p><p>The surrounding people only took a few glances and went back to their own business.</p><p>Chaotic Astral Ocean, it’s indeed chaotic Astral Ocean. It’s chaotic enough that killing people is a common occurrence.</p><p>A word of disagreement would cause blood to splatter.</p><p>“Let’s find a restaurant and have something to eat!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them were also used to seeing storms and had experienced countless life and death battles. Naturally, they got used to it very quickly.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and the two of them walked towards a restaurant.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as they arrived at the entrance of the restaurant, the entire restaurant exploded with a loud bang. Broken wood and gravel flew everywhere. Some of the people with lower cultivation were directly injured by the gravel.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and his quintessential essence burst forth. The front part of the gravel and wood fragments that were shot at them was destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Dozens of figures flew out from the ninth floor.</p><p>“Nest, those who curse and drink can’t even rest in peace!”</p><p>“Which bastard is fighting in the restaurant?”</p><p>Curses were heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; two figures shot up into the sky from the dust and began to battle, their powerful auras filling the air.</p><p>One of them was a brawny man, while the other was old ou. Both of them were Lv 9 martial King realm martial artists.</p><p>Many people immediately shut up.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in the air. In the end, the burly man was stronger and killed old ou with a single sword strike.</p><p>“Damn it, you dare to go against me, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The burly man cursed. He took the storage ring and was about to leave.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>A short and chubby man dressed as a shopkeeper flew up into the sky and said with a smile, ” the two of you have destroyed my restaurant. You haven’t even paid for it and you want to leave? that’s too immoral!</p><p>“Fatty, you still want me to compensate? Hehe, I think you’re tired of living.”</p><p>The burly man glanced at the short and fat shopkeeper and revealed a ferocious smile.</p><p>“It’s just a small business. If you destroy the restaurant, you have to pay.”</p><p>The short and fat shopkeeper said with a smile.</p><p>“Compensate? fine, I’ll use your head to compensate!”</p><p>The brawny man laughed hideously and slashed his sword at the short and fat manager’s throat.</p><p>The short and fat shopkeeper was still smiling. When the burly man’s sword was about to approach him, he struck out his palm. A huge palm condensed and crushed the burly man’s sword light, then caught him in his hand.</p><p>peak-tier King! Ah! I’ll pay! I’ll pay!</p><p>The burly man cried out in fear.</p><p>However, with a clench of his hand, the burly man’s body exploded and a storage ring flew into the short and fat manager’s hand.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it have been fine if you had compensated earlier? Sigh, I have to rebuild the restaurant again. What a loss, what a loss!”</p><p>The short and fat manager sighed repeatedly.</p><p>it seems like we’ll have to change to another restaurant to eat!</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>“This place is quite interesting. What do you think?”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled slightly, revealing two small canine teeth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
