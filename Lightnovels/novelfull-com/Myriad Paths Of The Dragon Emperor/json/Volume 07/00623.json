Do you want to come with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was deep and seemed to be able to penetrate through space and look into the distance. His eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>After all, the Tianxuan region was too small. The outside world was more exciting.</p><p>On the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory, there was only one Saint planet in the Tianxuan region, and it was ranked at the bottom.</p><p>What about the other heaven’s favorites? How powerful was he? How graceful was she? Lu Ming wanted to see how he could become stronger by clashing with those peerless talents.</p><p>Hearing Lu Ming’s words, the corners of Xie nianqing’s lips curled up slightly. He smiled and said, ” “Sure, of course I’m going with you. I haven’t even fulfilled the promise I made to myself.”</p><p>“Promise? what promise?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course I’m going to defeat you and trample you under my feet. You can’t run away.</p><p>Xie nianqing chuckled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. This girl still remembered this. How long had it been?</p><p>it seems that women are really narrow-minded. They hold grudges too much!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>However, he still felt a sense of urgency.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s improvement was too shocking. If he had been a little slower, he would have been surpassed by Xie nianqing.</p><p>Moreover, during the time that Xie nianqing disappeared, the martial arts technique that he cultivated had changed again. It seemed to be even more amazing.</p><p>“Where did she go? Should she barge into a secret place or return to her own home? If she’s from her own family, then her family background must be very shocking.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing and pondered.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing obviously didn’t want to talk about her family background, so he didn’t ask.</p><p>“What are you looking at?”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at him, then his eyes flashed as if he remembered something. “Lu Ming, did you find the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure that your father told you about?”</p><p>“You mean this?”</p><p>A Jade sword the length of a finger appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up. A Jade sword the length of a finger appeared in his hand. It was almost identical to the one in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them poured their Zhen Yuan into the Jade swords at the same time. The Jade swords glowed, and a map appeared on each of the Jade swords.</p><p>On the map, there was a route that led to a destination.</p><p>The two of them had the same destination.</p><p>“It seems like there are quite a lot of these Jade swords!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>as far as I know, this Jade sword should be the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure. There should be nine of them, and they are scattered all over the eastern barren territory. Only when all nine of them are gathered can we find the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>nine? then we only have two. It seems that we have no chance of getting the Martial Emperor’s treasure!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>no, nine. Eight of them have already been born.</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Eight swords? How did you know?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t you study this Jade sword?” Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming, speechless.</p><p>“Ahem, I didn’t really study it!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed awkwardly.</p><p>He indeed hadn’t studied it much. Before, he had been focused on improving his cultivation with the goal of defeating the sacred constellation. After that, he had been focused on studying the Dao of inscription and hadn’t really studied the Jade sword.</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Lu Ming speechlessly. “Look, on the hilt of this Jade sword, aren’t there a few faint inscriptions!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it seriously and he really saw some faint inscriptions.</p><p>there are nine inscriptions on it, which represent nine keys. Now, eight of them are shining, which means that eight keys have already been born and are in the hands of different people.</p><p>“And this map points to the end point. It’s in the chaotic Astral Ocean. I reckon that the other people who have obtained the key will definitely rush to the chaotic Astral Ocean. Go directly to the chaotic Astral Ocean?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Chaotic Astral Ocean?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Ocean is extremely famous in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>It was an inland sea, vast and boundless, more than ten times larger than the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Ocean is filled with islands scattered like stars. Countless martial arts experts live in these waters.</p><p>As its name suggested, riot referred to the chaotic inland sea where countless evil people gathered.</p><p>This was because this place was not the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, or the sky demon Valley.</p><p>Even the Overlord forces would find it hard to conquer this place.</p><p>Therefore, all the experts who have offended these Overlord forces hide in the chaotic Astral Ocean. No one will be able to find them.</p><p>In addition, there are countless big and small powers in the chaotic Astral Ocean, making this area extremely chaotic and full of killing. It’s common for people to draw their blades and kill people if they don’t agree with each other.</p><p>“You’re not afraid, are you?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming with a half-smile.</p><p>“The chaotic Astral Ocean is just what I want!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming had the bloodline of the nine Dragons. This place was most suitable for him.</p><p>“Alright, when do you plan to set off?”</p><p>“We’ll set off in two days!”</p><p>He had been back for a few months. It was time to leave.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing bade farewell to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>Although the couple was a little reluctant to part, they were happy to have Xie nianqing and Lu Ming go out and explore.</p><p>Only by adventuring together could they quickly increase their relationship, right?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two rainbow lights streaked across the sky and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>Their speed was unbelievably fast, and they arrived at Tianxuan city in a few days.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current reputation, it was not an easy task to take the inter-province transportation array.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stepped into the inter-province transportation portal.</p><p>The inter-province transportation formation formed a huge Whirlpool. With a flash of light, the two of them disappeared from the altar.</p><p>The cloud Peak area is a large area close to the chaotic Astral Ocean, and its territory is extremely vast.</p><p>However, in this region, the power of the Emperor heaven divine Palace did not cover the sky with one hand. Several powerful forces had established their own forces here, such as the Emperor heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the heavenly demon Valley.</p><p>They had also set up inter-province transportation formations.</p><p>If you want to go to the chaotic Astral Ocean, you can only teleport here first and then fly there.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had one more thing to do before they reached the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>To be precise, Xie nianqing wanted to seize a treasure from a force in the Yunfeng region.</p><p>The inter-province transportation formation in the Ditian divine Palace of the Yunfeng region flashed and two figures appeared.</p><p>They were Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“WOWO, this fee is too expensive!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached as he shouted.</p><p>The distance between the Tianxuan region and the Yunfeng region was 23 large regions. The teleportation fee was 1.5 million Supreme spiritual crystals per person.</p><p>The two of them had a total of 3000000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>In order to show that Lu Ming was a man, he had to pay out of his own pocket. In the end, he felt a great heartache.</p><p>Now, he was only left with more than 3000000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>it looks like I’ll have to find a way to get some Supreme-grade spirit crystals. Otherwise, I won’t even have enough to use, let alone break through to peak-tier King.</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
