Every time he attacked, he would not waste a single bit of power. He was extremely precise.</p><p>“Asura is in trouble!”</p><p>At this moment, everyone had the same thought.</p><p>Demonic wind was too strong. No wonder he was an old monster who had dominated this Sea area for hundreds of years. No one under the spiritual ocean tier dared to provoke him.</p><p>Many people thought that although Lu Ming was strong, he would not be a match for demonic wind.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. With one step, his body turned into a stream of light and soared into the sky, instantly avoiding the attack of old monster demonic wind.</p><p>The demonic wind was stunned when he missed. He looked up at the sky and saw Lu Ming floating there.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to have such a footwork. Not bad. I wonder how your attack power is.”</p><p>Eccentric demonic wind chuckled.</p><p>“If you want to know, then I’ll let you try!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw dozens of punches in a row. The force of his punches fell like meteors toward demonic wind.</p><p>Old monster demonic wind’s eyes turned cold as he waved his hands.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Wind blades were formed and flew into the sky, colliding with the fist force that was falling down.</p><p>The wind and the flames scattered and swept across the fighting ring.</p><p>The wind blade and the fist force canceled each other out.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he increased his essential core. This time, he threw more than a hundred punches in a row. The entire space was filled with fist force, and the momentum was extremely terrifying.</p><p>In the stands, Chen Zhao’s face turned pale. The power that Lu Ming was displaying now could easily defeat his brother, Chen Dao.</p><p>In every battle, Lu Ming seemed to have no limits. He gave off the feeling of a bottomless abyss with no end.</p><p>Demonic wind’s expression also became serious.</p><p>“Demonic Wind Slash!”</p><p>A long sword appeared in the demonic wind’s hand, emitting a dazzling green light. His body shot up into the sky, and a green sword light suddenly flashed out.</p><p>??…</p><p>Old monster demonic wind’s figure rushed into the fist radiance, and an ear-piercing sound rang out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the end, demonic wind broke through the range of the fist radiance and soared into the sky, standing side by side with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn!”</p><p>As soon as he spoke, he disappeared. He seemed to have turned into a gust of wind, drifting in the air.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The wind started blowing and the temperature dropped sharply. Then, snowflakes appeared out of thin air and swept toward Lu Ming along with the strong wind.</p><p>wind concept! Snow concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Old monster demonic wind had not only cultivated the wind mentality but also the snow mentality.</p><p>Both intents were at the great circle of level one.</p><p>it’s here! It’s here! It’s said that the demonic wind old monster has comprehended two wills. It’s true!</p><p>yes. I heard that demonic wind was very ambitious back then. He wanted to comprehend two intent realms, but he was stuck at peak-tier King realm, so he couldn’t break through to sea of soul realm. If he had only comprehended one intent realm, he would’ve already broken through to the sea of soul realm.</p><p>however, the power of the two intents is undoubted. The Shura is in danger.</p><p>In the stands, many of the older generation began to discuss excitedly.</p><p>“Haha, junior, die!”</p><p>Old monster demonic wind’s smug voice rang out from the snowstorm.</p><p>“What’s there to be proud of? You’ve comprehended two types of intent, but you haven’t been able to merge them together. The increase in power is very limited.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was still very calm. He waved his fists and blasted out streams of fist force, blocking the attacks of the wind and snow around him.</p><p>The snowflakes were snow-white and crystal clear. They were even sharper than spirit weapons, and each of them could probably pierce through a mountain with a diameter of a hundred meters.</p><p>“Intent fusion? what do you know, junior? Do you think it’s so easy to fuse two concepts? You’re really ignorant.”</p><p>The demonic wind’s voice was filled with disdain and reprimand.</p><p>is it very difficult to fuse two intents? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming’s voice fell, Lu Ming’s fist momentum suddenly changed.</p><p>Not only did the fist light contain the fire concept, but it also contained the Thunder concept.</p><p>As soon as the Thunder and fire essences were released, the two essences were perfectly combined together, causing the power of the exploding star fist to suddenly increase by a large margin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The vast fist radiance pierced through the snowstorm. With a scream, a figure appeared and retreated.</p><p>“The fusion of Thunder and fire intents, the perfect fusion of Thunder and fire intents, how is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Blood trickled down the corner of demonic wind’s mouth, but he did not care. His eyes were fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>The audience was also dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had also comprehended two intents and he had successfully fused them. However, the demonic wind had not.</p><p>It was clear at a glance who was stronger and who was weaker.</p><p>what’s impossible about it? just because you can’t fuse with it doesn’t mean others can’t.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Tell me, how did you merge them? tell me, tell me!”</p><p>The demonic wind roared. His eyes were red as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>For so many years, old monster demonic wind had tried many methods, but he couldn’t succeed. It was like the demon in his heart.</p><p>even if I tell you, you won’t be able to fuse it. It requires talent.</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>He wasn’t wrong. In fact, he wasn’t the only one who thought of that method. Others could have thought of it too, but how many people could successfully merge it?</p><p>To put it bluntly, it required talent.</p><p>He had this talent, and now it seemed that Xie nianqing also had this talent.</p><p>Demonic wind had been cultivating for hundreds of years, but he hadn’t succeeded. He definitely didn’t have this talent.</p><p>However, eccentric demonic wind clearly didn’t believe this.</p><p>“Bullshit, what talent? Brat, if you don’t tell me, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>Old monster demonic wind roared.</p><p>old man, is there something wrong with your head? do you still think you’re my match? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“Take my strongest move!”</p><p>Demonic wind roared and released his wind and snow intent.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to waste my time with you, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, wind, fire, and Thunder, the three intents burst out at the same time and turned into a spear light that was extremely bright.</p><p>Old monster demonic wind’s eyes were as big as bells as he roared in disbelief, three intents fused!</p><p>It was simply unbearable for him. He had spent his entire life and had not been able to merge the two concepts successfully. However, Lu Ming had merged three concepts.</p><p>Moreover, he was so young.</p><p>Could it really be because of his talent?</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The dazzling spear radiance pierced through the void and appeared in front of old monster demonic wind in an instant. It broke through all of old monster demonic wind’s defenses with a crushing force.</p><p>The long spear pierced through the heart of eccentric demonic wind. He was dead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
