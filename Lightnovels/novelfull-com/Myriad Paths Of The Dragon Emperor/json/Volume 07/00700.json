I hope you don’t misunderstand. You’re an outsider, right? our tribe just wants to ask you for a favor!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and was about to leave.</p><p>brother, all the tribes are looking for you. If you leave our red leopard tribe, you will have to go to other tribes. Some tribes are very evil. If you come to our red leopard tribe and help us, we will do our best to help you if you have any requests in the future!</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows, pondered, and smiled.”What’s your name? What’s your status in the red leopard tribe?”</p><p>“I’m chi Yue, I’m …”</p><p>The young woman was about to reveal her identity when the old man interrupted her.</p><p>“Miss, don’t easily reveal your identity!” The old man said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Elder Redbeard, don’t worry. It’ll be fine!”</p><p>“I am the daughter of the red leopard tribe’s chief. If you follow me back to the tribe, the red leopard tribe will definitely treat you as an honored guest!” Chi Yue smiled and continued.</p><p>“The red leopard tribe’s chief’s daughter?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His eyes flashed as he looked at Chi Yue and said,”How can I believe you? How about this, you come with me to the mountain ahead, I have something to discuss with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed to a mountain range in front of them.</p><p>“No, little brother, your request is too much. How can we trust you?”</p><p>Elder red beard shouted.</p><p>“Oh? If that’s the case, then there’s no room for discussion. Don’t follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>“Miss, you can’t. It’s too dangerous for you to go alone!”</p><p>Elder Chi Xu objected.</p><p>elder Redbeard, don’t worry. I have no enmity with him. He won’t benefit from killing me!</p><p>Chi Yue smiled and controlled the puppet to fly towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He did not expect Chi Yue to dare to follow him.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the giant wolf puppet and flew towards the mountain range with Chi Yue in the front and behind.</p><p>Elder Redbeard could only stand there anxiously.</p><p>A hundred miles away, the two of them landed in the mountain range.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he destroyed all the surveillance runes nearby.</p><p>“I heard that your inscriptions are profound, and it seems like it’s true!”</p><p>Chi Yue looked at Lu Ming, her eyes bright.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Chi Yue with a smile on his face. The next moment, his figure turned into a flash of lightning and he suddenly rushed toward Chi Yue.</p><p>At the same time, the giant wolf puppet let out a low growl and also charged at Chi Yue.</p><p>Chi Yue was taken aback. She never expected Lu Ming to make a move so suddenly. She could only control the cheetah puppet to block while she retreated at top speed. She waved her hands continuously and inscribed runes.</p><p>The two puppets collided into each other and fought fiercely. Lu Ming’s figure stopped and he stomped on the ground. Runes appeared one after another and formed a combat sword, slashing at Chi Yue.</p><p>Chi Yue’s inscription was a huge Red Cheetah that pounced forward.</p><p>Chi Yue’s Dao of inscription was extremely profound and had reached rank 6. She was also a true inscription refiner and had probably lit several rank 6 spirit lamps. She was also very powerful.</p><p>The two of them finished inscribing the array in an instant, but Lu Ming also had a powerful martial arts cultivation besides the Dao of inscription.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and a dazzling spear ray pierced forward, aiming at Chi Yue’s throat. Chi Yue was shocked and retreated again. However, as he retreated, the inscription was interrupted.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure suddenly appeared in front of Chi Yue. He stretched out his hand and clasped Chi Yue’s throat. At the same time, his other hand held Chi Yue’s slender waist. Essential Qi surged in and sealed Chi Yue’s essential core.</p><p>Chi Yue also cultivated martial arts, but martial arts were only auxiliary. She had only reached the first level of the martial King realm, which was far from Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Chi Yue’s movements came to an abrupt stop, and the cheetah puppet also stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming made the giant wolf puppet stop as well. Their actions seemed rather intimate.</p><p>“Brother, don’t misunderstand. I really don’t have any ill intentions!”</p><p>Chi Yue called out. She blushed slightly when she felt Lu Ming’s scorching aura behind her.</p><p>“I know you don’t have any ill intentions. Otherwise, you would have been dead by now!”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered in Chi Yue’s ear. His hot breath blew on Chi Yue’s neck, making her feel a little strange.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming had suddenly attacked Chi Yue, but he did not sense any killing intent from her.</p><p>If Chi Yue had any killing intent towards him, she would definitely have revealed it in that situation.</p><p>“What you said just now, is it true? If I go to your tribe with you, you won’t take away my personal freedom, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, definitely not. Our elders have already passed down the message that we will try to bring you back without any conflict, not by force. After all, we need your help this time.</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>“Is it because of the person with the heavenly mandate?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“So you already know. That’s right, it’s because of this!” Chi Yue nodded.</p><p>“Then you’ll be going to the holy mountain in a month?”</p><p>“Yes, at that time, all the tribes will send people to worship the ancestors. This time, maybe one of you can awaken the ancient ancestor!”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll follow you to the red leopard tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming released his hand and took a few steps back.</p><p>Lu Ming had called Chi Yue over to test the waters. If what she said was true, there was no harm in going to the red leopard tribe with her.</p><p>After all, if he wanted to go to the holy mountain alone, he would have to pass by many tribes along the way. It was too difficult. At that time, it would definitely be much easier to go with the red leopard tribe.</p><p>“Really? That’s great!”</p><p>Chi Yue laughed happily. She then looked at Lu Ming curiously and asked,”Your Dao of inscriptions is so powerful. Although you’re only at the peak of heaven grade, you can easily control divine grade puppets and inscribe great inscription formations at the same time. I’ve never seen an inscriber as powerful as you!”</p><p>“Heaven grade? God-level?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He had heard others talk about it before. Could it be that the division of realms in the underground world was different from theirs?</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood after Chi Xue explained.</p><p>It turned out that the division of the Dao of inscription in this world was different from that of the outside world.</p><p>They were divided into primary, yellow, black, earth, heaven, and God-level.</p><p>God-level was the highest.</p><p>the divine level corresponds to a rank six inscriber, but the divine level is the highest here. Could it be that the highest inscriber in the underground world can only reach rank six? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious.</p><p>deity-level is the highest level. For thousands of years, no one has been able to break through to the deity-level and reach a higher level. It’s said that the ancient ancestor is definitely an existence that has surpassed the deity-level, and by a lot!</p><p>Chi Yue said with a look of yearning.</p><p>The two of them flew onto their puppets and chatted as they returned to where they came from.</p><p>When elder Chi Xu saw that Chi Yue and Lu Ming had returned safely, he was naturally very excited.</p><p>elder Redbeard, this is Lu Ming. He’s an impressive inscriber!</p><p>Red Moon introduced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
