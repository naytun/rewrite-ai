Therefore, it was normal for Lu Ming to spend half an hour to set up the chain formation and kill Zhong Mo, who was at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>If he was given more time, he could even set up an even stronger formation and kill even stronger sea of soul realm experts. Of course, that would be if the other party stepped into the formation.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly forward. On the way, he encountered a few underground humans riding on giant wolf puppets. Lu Ming had to use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to shake them off.</p><p>every team has a puppet equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was in deep thought.</p><p>The fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier was much stronger than him. If he encountered them, he could only run.</p><p>this won’t do. We can’t continue blindly like this. We have to catch an underground human and find out what’s going on with the underground world.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. Of course, he could not fight it head-on. He still had to rely on inscriptions.</p><p>Lu Ming chose a place and began to inscribe runes. This time, Lu Ming spent three hours setting up eighty-one level-five rune arrays.</p><p>There were also three illusionary arrays that covered up the traces of the inscription array.</p><p>Then, he rose into the air and randomly chose a direction to fly in.</p><p>Soon, he saw a group of underground humans riding on giant wolf puppets.</p><p>“People from outside the earth, stop!”</p><p>With a loud roar, the group of people charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and ran. Soon, he arrived at the place where the array was set up. He landed on the ground and ran forward.</p><p>The underground humans also landed and chased after them on their giant wolves.</p><p>After chasing for a while, Lu Ming suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed coldly. He took a step forward and the array was activated. Countless inscriptions intertwined and enveloped more than a hundred underground humans.</p><p>damn it, this person knows inscriptions. We’ve fallen into his trap. Break out, break out!</p><p>A burly man riding on a giant wolf puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier roared repeatedly as he charged to the side. However, what he was greeted with was endless attacks.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The burly man’s hand moved and a picture scroll appeared. After he unfurled it, a light screen enveloped the burly man.</p><p>“Inscription scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Other than the Great Khan, there were also some other people who took out inscription scrolls, defensive scrolls, offensive scrolls, and various other scrolls.</p><p>They controlled the puppets and kept attacking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had spent three hours to inscribe the array here. There were a total of eighty-one of them. How could it be so easy to break through?</p><p>For a time, there were constant rumbles, and the underground humans could not rush out at all.</p><p>these underground humans also practice martial arts, but their martial arts cultivation is much lower than their inscription cultivation. It seems that their martial arts cultivation is only to assist their inscription cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the attacks while observing.</p><p>Among them, a few underground humans with high cultivation bases were drawing with their hands. They were actually inscribing a large inscription array to resist Lu Ming’s array.</p><p>True Ming refinement master.</p><p>Among the hundred people, Lu Ming saw at least five true inscription refiners.</p><p>There were even two six extreme true inscription refiners.</p><p>amazing! The subterranean humans are so advanced in the Dao of inscription. The number of true inscription Masters is really high. Those puppets are too hard. Let’s kill the subterranean humans first!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and controlled the inscription array to attack the underground humans on the puppet.</p><p>Miserable shrieks rang out continuously as more and more underground humans were killed.</p><p>“My friend from beyond the earth, we have no ill intentions. We just want to invite you to the heavenly Wolf tribe for a chat. You don’t have to be so ruthless!”</p><p>The strongest Man shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He had no ill intentions?</p><p>There were more than a thousand of them, and less than two hundred of them had escaped. The rest had all died. How could they have no ill intentions?</p><p>How could Lu Ming believe it?</p><p>He focused on controlling the formation. The beautiful inscriptions glowed and turned into a terrifying killing weapon.</p><p>One by one, the underground humans were killed.</p><p>Of course, he controlled even more attacks, aiming at the strongest underground human.</p><p>The eighty-one great formations revolted, and their power was terrifying. Not long after, only two of the more than one hundred subterranean humans were left. The others were all dead, including the strongest Man.</p><p>Even those lower-grade puppets had been shattered, and only five spiritual ocean tier puppets remained.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the array to calm down. He looked at the two survivors with a cold gaze.</p><p>The two men’s faces were pale, and their eyes revealed endless fear.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had deliberately left the two of them behind.</p><p>“What should I ask next? What are you going to answer? Or else, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the two of them.</p><p>“Outsider, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>One of them roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. With a wave of his hand, a ray of spear light shot out and nailed the man to the ground. Then, he looked at the last man and said,”How about you?”</p><p>“I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you everything, please let me go!”</p><p>The man shouted.</p><p>This person was a middle-aged man. He was tall and thin, and he looked quite shrewd.</p><p>“I’ll let you go as long as you can give me a satisfactory explanation!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming walked to the few puppets that had not been destroyed. With a wave of his hand, he put away the five giant wolf puppets. Then, he grabbed the tall and thin man and left the place.</p><p>As they flew, Lu Ming asked the expert some questions.</p><p>The tall and thin man naturally told Lu Ming everything he knew and explained to the best of his ability. He was afraid that Lu Ming would be dissatisfied and kill him.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on a green rock on a mountain peak.</p><p>As for the tall and thin man, Lu Ming let him go.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he let him go, since the other party didn’t know where he was.</p><p>“So this really is the underground world, and it’s divided into so many tribes!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and recalled the words of the tall and thin burly man.</p><p>The underground world was divided into many human tribes. The one that Lu Ming and the rest had encountered before was called the heavenly Wolf tribe. It was just one of many tribes.</p><p>Thousands of years ago, the humans here only knew some shallow martial arts cultivation methods. But thousands of years ago, the ancient ancestor of the underground humans descended and passed down the Dao of inscription, greatly increasing the battle strength of the underground humans.</p><p>However, after the ancient ancestor passed down some inscription techniques, he fell into a deep sleep on the holy mountain. This sleep lasted for thousands of years.</p><p>After the ancient ancestor fell into a deep sleep, the various tribes fought one after another. The underground world fell into chaos, and thousands of years passed.</p><p>However, there was a legend in each tribe in the underground world. That was, one day, someone from the outer world would descend, and one of them would be the chosen one to awaken the ancient ancestor. If a tribe obtained this chosen one, they would receive a great reward from the ancient ancestor.</p><p>Therefore, they went around to capture Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>So that was the case. Lu Ming’s mind became clear.</p><p>“Ancient ancestor? Holy mountain? The chosen one? What’s all this about?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>He had asked the tall and thin man but he did not know either. Most of the information was just legends. He only knew where the holy mountain was and had even given Lu Ming a map.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
