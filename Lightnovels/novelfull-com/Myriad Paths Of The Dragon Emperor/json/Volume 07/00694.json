He saw that there was a rune on each arrow. The rune was not even the size of a palm and was stuck to the arrow.</p><p>As soon as the arrow hit its target, the runes on the arrow would explode and release a huge amount of energy.</p><p>The explosion of the arrow was caused by these runes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed rapidly, trying his best to avoid the arrow and not come into contact with it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Violent explosions rang out continuously, accompanied by waves of miserable screams. Many people were killed.</p><p>However, most of the people who were killed were martial artists below the fourth level martial King realm. Those above the fourth level martial King realm had used their intent and powerful true origin to protect themselves and withstand the power of the explosion.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>However, the arrows continued to come, and the sky was filled with the violent sound of the air being torn.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He realized that there were a few arrows that were terrifyingly fast. They were several times faster than the other arrows and reached him in an instant.</p><p>He dodged quickly, but there was still an arrow that he could not avoid. It landed in front of Lu Ming, and Lu Ming’s quintessential essence exploded, forming a quintessential essence shield. With a bang, the arrow exploded.</p><p>“What a powerful arrow! This arrow has astonishing penetrative power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. Although he had shattered the arrow, he was fine because of his profound cultivation and rich essential core.</p><p>But others were not so good.</p><p>Even more screams were heard. Many martial artists at Lv 4 martial King realm and above had their Zhen Yuan shields pierced through. Their bodies were pierced by the arrows, and they died an unnatural death.</p><p>Only the martial artists at the seventh level of the martial King realm and above managed to block the arrows, but it also consumed a lot of their vital essence.</p><p>Runes again!</p><p>Lu Ming realized that there was a rune attached to the arrows with high penetrative power. The green rune could greatly increase the speed and penetrative power.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Before one wave was over, another wave came.</p><p>Just now, the burly man’s combat strength was so strong that he was probably the focus of attention. Arrows were shot at him continuously, leaving him no time to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>charge! Charge in one direction! Otherwise, we’ll all die!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Charge, charge in one direction!”</p><p>Everyone joined forces and charged in the same direction.</p><p>Just now, they still had more than a thousand people, but in this short while, they only had three to four hundred people left. More than half of them had been killed.</p><p>Hundreds of people charged in one direction, instantly breaking through the arrows.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The earth rumbled, and howls came from ahead. They were the howls of wolves.</p><p>Smoke and dust filled the air, and giant waves appeared, rushing towards them.</p><p>On each of the giant wolves, there was a figure.</p><p>These figures were dressed completely different from them. There were men and women. The women were covered in beast skins, revealing their slender legs. The men were bare-chested, wearing beast skins. Their skin was bronze in color, and they carried longbows on their backs.</p><p>“Kill! These people have trespassed the forbidden area. Kill them all!”</p><p>A brawny man shouted.</p><p>The giant wolf howled and stomped on the ground, charging toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, attacks of sword Qi, saber radiance, and the like burst out, slashing at the huge waves.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>When their attacks landed on the giant wolves, there was a sound of metal clashing. The giant wolves were not afraid of the attack and rushed over, their claws as sharp as blades.</p><p>A Lv 7 martial King realm martial artist’s protective genuine vitality was torn apart by the Wolf’s claws, and then his body was also torn apart.</p><p>It wasn’t just one person who ended up like this, but many.</p><p>“A puppet, this is a puppet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and sent a giant wolf flying. His pupils shrank slightly.</p><p>These giant wolves were not made of flesh and blood, but were puppets made of various metals.</p><p>His body was as strong as Vajra and indestructible.</p><p>Most importantly, there were too many puppets. There were at least a thousand of them, and this was only one direction. There were still more in the other directions.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and the huge waves were sent flying. Some giant wolves exploded directly.</p><p>“Kill that brat!”</p><p>A burly man riding an exceptionally large Wolf charged toward Lu Ming. His huge Wolf claws were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear and swept it across. With a loud boom, the giant wolf was pushed back, but Lu Ming’s body also trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>It was equivalent to a spiritual ocean tier puppet Wolf.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man was pushed back. He then controlled the puppet Wolf to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming fired his spear and forced the giant wolf back. He did not linger in the battle and rushed over.</p><p>The brawny man from the blood poison sect was the most miserable. He was surrounded by three powerful and terrifying giant wolves.</p><p>Of the three giant wolf puppets, one was equivalent to the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, and the other two were equivalent to the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. Their bodies were indestructible, and they suppressed the burly man.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the other four directions, the earth also let out violent rumbles and wolf howls. It was unknown how many puppet armies were charging toward them.</p><p>“Charge, charge!”</p><p>Many martial artists charged forward without any regard for their own safety, displaying all of their trump cards.</p><p>The situation was too dangerous. If they didn’t rush out, they would be surrounded by the puppet armies from the other three directions, and only death awaited them.</p><p>“Those who trespass the forbidden area will be killed without mercy, kill!”</p><p>The battle cries shook the sky, and the attacks were like a tide.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and charged forward. Along the way, he repelled a few puppets at the spirit sea realm. He continued to charge forward.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>A huge figure at least two meters tall slashed at him with a saber in his hand. The blade cut through the air, creating a terrifying Sonic Boom.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his infinite Dragon Spear. A terrifying force surged over and Lu Ming’s body floated backward.</p><p>it’s equivalent to a puppet at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. Furthermore, it’s a humanoid!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned serious. Then, he moved and dashed to the right.</p><p>The human-shaped puppet’s entire body was metallic in color. Its eyes were extremely cold as it stomped on the ground. A huge pit reappeared on the ground as it charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and runes appeared. At the same time, he waved his hands and runes sank into the ground.</p><p>“An inscription master!”</p><p>The human-shaped puppet was surprised to be able to speak the human language.</p><p>“I’m sleepy!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and runes filled the ground, turning into a large net that covered the humanoid puppet. The humanoid puppet swung its sword, but it could not break through it at the moment.</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Let’s go by air.”</p><p>The others followed suit and tried to escape through the air.</p><p>However, what made them despair was that the giant wolf puppets actually extended a pair of wings from both sides and could also fly into the sky to pursue them.</p><p>This was a bloody battle, and no one could care about each other. Everyone desperately tried to break out.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea how many giant wolf puppets he had repelled before he rushed out of the cemetery and into a forest.</p><p>In this place, the speed of flight was greatly suppressed. Lu Ming had flown for more than an hour and he had only flown more than ten thousand miles. Moreover, the consumption of his essential core was extremely terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
