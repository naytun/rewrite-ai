It opened its mouth and five to six scimitars flew out of its mouth, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>That scimitar was actually made from the teeth of a tiger shark and was even sharper than a fifth-grade spiritual weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell the strength of a peak-tier King-level tiger shark with one glance.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and sent five to six scimitars flying. A three-colored Spear’s gleam burst out and shot directly into the tiger shark’s head, leaving a hole in it.</p><p>He killed a peak-tier King Tiger shark with one move and devoured its essence blood.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to kill.</p><p>Not only did he devour the blood essence of the Tiger sharks he killed, but he also devoured the blood essence of the Tiger sharks killed by others. His body flashed, and the blood essence of tiger sharks of all levels was constantly devoured by him.</p><p>“This is too good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had participated in such a large-scale battle. For others, such a large-scale battle was hell, but for him, it was a Holy Land, a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>He circulated the devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline on his palm, constantly devouring the tiger shark’s blood essence. Of course, if a martial artist died in battle, he would not let them go. He would devour all the blood essence.</p><p>He divided a part of his mind to control the nine Dragon bloodline and refine the blood essence to improve his second bloodline.</p><p>“Kill, kill the one with the mask.”</p><p>A loud roar came from nearby, and three Giant Tiger sharks charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The seawater condensed into long Spears and pierced toward Lu Ming. At the same time, there were also curved daggers that cut through the void.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura surged and soared into the sky. He took a few steps and killed three peak-tier King-level tiger sharks.</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing was even more shocked. The sky demon force field was an abnormal existence in a group battle. As long as the sky demon force field covered the Tiger sharks, they would be divided into several pieces without them knowing.</p><p>Under the spirit sea, Xie nianqing and Lu Ming were unrivaled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of silver light shot toward Lu Ming at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>It was also a tiger shark, but it was only ten meters long. However, its entire body was silver, and it was covered in a layer of silver scales.</p><p>Lu Ming subconsciously swept the long spear out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept across the silver Tigershark’s body. It was as if it had been hit by a towering mountain. Its body trembled and it could not help but take three steps back.</p><p>However, the silver Tigershark was also sent flying by Lu Ming’s whip.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>After the silver Tigershark flew out, it was completely fine. It roared and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Under the silver Tiger shark’s control, the sea water turned into all kinds of weapons.</p><p>Sharp swords, long Spears, long Spears …</p><p>There were a total of more than a hundred of them, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>“This one is a mutated tiger shark!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Some demonic beasts had the bloodlines of ancient godly beasts and ferocious beasts. They were extremely powerful and much stronger than demonic beasts of the same level.</p><p>Clearly, this tiger shark was a descendant.</p><p>Many demonic beasts with powerful bloodlines not only had immense physical strength, but also immense demonic power. At a certain level, they could also awaken combat skills hidden in their bloodlines and possess all kinds of divine abilities.</p><p>Moreover, demonic beasts and martial artists were different. Demonic beasts would not comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth like martial artists, but demonic beasts were innately inclined to a certain attribute, and they were born with the ability to master a certain attribute. As their strength grew, they would become stronger and stronger.</p><p>This was a talent that the human race could not compare to.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The spear swept out, and all the weapons made of seawater instantly collapsed.</p><p>&Nbsp; a three-colored spear light burst out and struck the silver Tiger shark’s head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The silver Tigershark was sent flying like a cannonball. Along the way, it killed a few powerful Tigersharks and flew a few thousand meters before stopping.</p><p>However, he wasn’t dead yet. There was only a hole a few feet deep in his head.</p><p>“What a strong defense, and such hard scales!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised.</p><p>The tiger shark’s defense was amazing, as it was not penetrated by his spear radiance.</p><p>strong, this human’s attack is too strong. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, but the silver Tigershark was simply terrified. As soon as it stabilized itself, it hurriedly flew into the distance.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. His speed was unbelievably fast. He turned into a stream of light and caught up with the silver Tigershark in no time.</p><p>“You want to kill me? die!”</p><p>Demonic beasts were already very hostile. Seeing that it could not escape, the silver Tigershark’s ferocity was aroused and it pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>What welcomed him was an extremely sharp spear.</p><p>This time, it was not the spear radiance, but the tip of the corpse of the infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear pierced through the silver Tigershark’s head.</p><p>The silver Tigershark roared and stopped breathing.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out his long spear and devoured the silver Tigershark’s blood essence.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. BOOM! His body was covered in a blood-red light, emitting powerful fluctuations.</p><p>His second bloodline was about to advance.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to suppress the fluctuation of his second bloodline, trying not to attract attention.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the strength of his second blood Meridian was increasing rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the second bloodline couldn’t be suppressed anymore. It appeared above his head and eight silver rings dazzled, attracting many people’s attention.</p><p>Fortunately, when the second blood Meridian appeared, it had already been successfully promoted. The crowd did not see the process of the promotion but only the results. They thought that Lu Ming had an eighth level King level Blood Meridian.</p><p>Although an eighth level King bloodline was extremely shocking, no one paid any attention to it in this life-and-death battle.</p><p>Lu Ming had never activated his Blood Meridian in the previous battle. Therefore, everyone thought that Lu Ming originally had an eighth level King level Blood Meridian.</p><p>However, there was one exception, and that was Xie nianqing.</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing pouted when he saw the eight silver chakras on Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian.</p><p>when this guy’s second bloodline first awakened, he was only a third level King. Now, he’s become an eighth level King. His bloodline can actually level up. This guy is hiding a lot of things from me.</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered softly.</p><p>“Kill, kill this little girl!”</p><p>At this moment, two silver Tiger sharks charged at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky demon force field, destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as he fought with the two silver Tigersharks.</p><p>After a few breaths, Lu Ming kept his second bloodline and continued to kill.</p><p>The great battle was still ongoing.</p><p>The ocean was a sea of blood red, with floating corpses of humans and sea beasts.</p><p>On golden sand island, there were more than 500000 Warriors above the level of martial Grandmaster, and more than 50000 Warriors above the level of martial King.</p><p>However, the number of sea beasts was even greater. They were densely packed and covered the sea area that was thousands of miles long. They launched their attacks fearlessly.</p><p>In the sky, the battle between spiritual ocean tier Warriors also entered a state of anxiety, and it would be difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
