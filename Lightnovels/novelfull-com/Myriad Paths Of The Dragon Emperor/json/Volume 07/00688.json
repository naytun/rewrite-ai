Even Lu Ming himself did not know how powerful the complete level-five mental fire, in addition to the inscription arrays given to him by dandan, could be.</p><p>...</p><p>However, it was definitely stronger than his martial arts battle prowess.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist’s experience and knowledge of the Dao of inscription were integrated into Lu Ming’s mind along with the mental energy fire. These were precious treasures. They were the seven-colored Daoist’s thousand years of experience in cultivating the Dao of inscription.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still needed to spend some time to master it if he wanted to use it for himself.</p><p>The two of them landed on the island and cultivated while waiting.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming secretly went to the small island to take a look and discovered that there was an additional person.</p><p>A young man was sitting cross-legged on another stone pillar.</p><p>Lu Ming did not show himself. He returned to the island.</p><p>At this moment, there was movement in the Jade sword. Lu Ming took it out and injected his essential core into it. A sound was heard.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ve arrived at my destination. Brother Liu is with me. When will you arrive?”</p><p>A rough voice sounded. It should be the burly man.</p><p>“I’m on my way, let’s wait a few days!”</p><p>Old ou’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied in the same way.</p><p>The other voices also gave similar answers.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ve already arrived at the chaotic Astral Ocean, but it’ll still take me ten days to reach my destination. I’m really sorry!”</p><p>The timid voice sounded.</p><p>“It’s fine to wait for a few more days, but let’s set a rule. Those who come to meet us should show their Jade swords. This way, both sides can prove their identity to avoid any misunderstandings!”</p><p>The rough voice said.</p><p>“Alright, I have no objections!”</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>A series of voices sounded.</p><p>Xie nianqing remained silent.</p><p>One reason was that Xie nianqing didn’t like to talk. Another reason was that they didn’t want to reveal one Jade sword. It might be useful at a critical moment.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the Jade sword and continued cultivating.</p><p>He was able to integrate the seven-colored Daoist’s experience very quickly, and his understanding and application of the Dao of inscriptions were advancing at a tremendous pace.</p><p>Of course, all inscription Masters leaned towards different directions.</p><p>Some leaned towards forging, some leaned towards refining pills, some leaned towards creating talismans, and some leaned towards formations.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist’s focus was on alchemy, followed by formations.</p><p>Lu Ming’s knowledge and experience in refining pills increased rapidly. Of course, his array technique also improved very quickly.</p><p>On the island, Lu Ming’s footsteps were continuous. Without a sound, the ground was covered with inscriptions. At the same time, he waved his hands and inscriptions flashed in the air, flying into the surrounding trees and rocks.</p><p>After a while, he stopped.</p><p>boy, your luck is really enviable. A perfected Level 5, the seven-colored Daoist’s experience, and your abnormal talent in inscription. Now, you’re completely a qualified true inscription master!</p><p>On the side, dandan sighed endlessly.</p><p>It was not easy to get dandan’s praise.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had only been in contact with the Dao of inscription for a short period of time and his Foundation was lacking. Although the cultivation of the mental energy fire was very fast, other things could not make up for it. A large amount of time was needed to accumulate.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had integrated the seven-colored Daoist’s experience, he skipped this step. His experience, mental energy fire, and other aspects were on par.</p><p>Of course, this was an opportunity that could not be replicated. The seven-colored Daoist had rushed into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness on his own in an attempt to occupy Lu Ming’s body. Other inscriers would not do the same and rush into other people’s sea of consciousness. Lu Ming happened to have the earth core flowing flame and the underworld God visualization method.</p><p>With his achievements in the Dao of inscription, Lu Ming put more effort into the cultivation of martial arts.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another ten days passed.</p><p>Every two days, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing would go to the island to observe. There were more and more people on the island.</p><p>There were already five people there.</p><p>Even the timid woman had arrived.</p><p>“Everyone’s almost here, let’s go meet them!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Those five people had been living together in peace these few days, so there shouldn’t be any problems.</p><p>“Alright!” Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>The two of them headed towards the island.</p><p>Soon, they were approaching the island. The two of them did not hide their whereabouts. When they arrived, the five people on the island naturally discovered them.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>One of the burly men spoke in a rough voice.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand moved and a Crystal Jade sword appeared.</p><p>The other five’s eyes lit up, and a Jade sword appeared in each of their hands.</p><p>“Sir, I’ve said before that you’re not allowed to tell anyone else. What do you mean by bringing one person here?”</p><p>The burly man’s face turned cold.</p><p>The others ‘expressions turned cold as they looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“She’s my wife. Why? I can’t even bring my wife?”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and smiled.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and he gritted his teeth. This guy took advantage of him again.</p><p>However, under such circumstances, she could not deny it and let Lu Ming hold her hand.</p><p>“Wife?”</p><p>The burly man’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Since she’s my wife, I think she should be fine!”</p><p>A timid voice sounded. The owner of this voice was a young woman. She was very beautiful and looked very weak. However, from her aura, she seemed to be a peak-tier King.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, brother, please come to the island!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He pulled Xie nianqing along and landed on the island. Step by step, they walked towards a stone pillar in the center of the island.</p><p>No one noticed that every time Lu Ming took a step, there would be a faint light flashing at the place where his feet touched the ground.</p><p>Soon, they were approaching the stone pillar, but at this moment, something strange happened.</p><p>The five people on the stone pillar moved in a flash and surrounded Lu Ming and Xie nianqing from five different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>“Everyone, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept the surroundings.</p><p>“It’s simple, hand over your Jade sword!”</p><p>The burly man sneered.</p><p>“So you want my Jade sword. But even if I give it to you, it’s not enough for you to share!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, kid, you don’t need to divide us. We’re from the same force, so why do you need to divide us? ”</p><p>Old ou sneered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>This was because old ou’s voice was clearly not the same person as the voice he had heard from the Jade sword.</p><p>“Have you noticed? During this period of time, they all came and then, they all died!”</p><p>The delicate woman spoke, but at this time, she didn’t feel timid, and her voice was very cold.</p><p>A trap, everything was a trap.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p>“The others are all dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he said coldly.</p><p>that’s right. Kid, let me tell you. We already have two Jade swords. That’s why senior brother Zhong Mo and I put on an act. I’ve actually arrived a long time ago, but I said I wasn’t. I just wanted to lower your guard!</p><p>The delicate-looking woman sneered, as if she was very proud.</p><p>The senior brother Zhong Mo he was referring to was the burly man with the rough voice.</p><p>No wonder it was only the two of them who had been talking earlier. No one else had spoken. Once the others opened their mouths, they would have been exposed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The auras of the five of them exploded and locked onto Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
