However, with the strength of my mental energy fire, I don’t need to reach Level Seven to be able to inscribe an array in the air!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought as he fought.</p><p>“To the surface!”</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming controlled the giant wolf puppet to rush to the ground.</p><p>The others tried to stop him.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Some of the puppets in front of Lu Ming were knocked away by the giant wolf puppet.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>While he was still in mid-air, Lu Ming launched a Gokudo attack. He turned into a ray of light and broke through everything. Several martial King realm puppets in front of him exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the ground. He stomped on the ground and runes appeared on the ground.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Two swords appeared in the air, and with a single slash, the puppets were cut in half.</p><p>“How could this be? He could control a fourth-ranked divine puppet and even inscribe a great formation? How can his spiritual power be so strong?”</p><p>The old man was shocked.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The giant wolf puppet knocked aside a bunch of cheetah puppets and appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s footsteps became faster and faster. Runes kept flashing on the ground and all kinds of attacks were launched in all directions.</p><p>“Use the inscription scrolls and blast him!”</p><p>The young man roared, giving orders from the side.</p><p>Many people took out inscription scrolls and opened them. All kinds of violent attacks poured down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and layers of light screens were formed. However, with a shake, these light screens shattered one after another.</p><p>After all, the inscription formation was an instantaneous one and its power was limited. It couldn’t block the attack of some powerful inscription scrolls.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed. He stomped his foot and a dazzling Spear’s gleam shot towards the young man. Some of the puppets in front of the young man and the people on them were either shattered or sent flying.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming mounted the giant wolf puppet and charged towards the young man.</p><p>His target was this young man. This young man seemed to have a high status. As long as he could take down this young man, he would have a chance to escape.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically. He wanted to help, but it was too late.</p><p>The young man’s expression changed drastically as well. He retreated quickly and controlled the puppet under him to charge at Lu Ming. At the same time, an inscription talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The youth’s puppet had the strength of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, but the giant wolf puppet sent it flying with a single slap, almost exploding.</p><p>Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside the young man in an instant. Before the young man could open the inscription talisman scroll, he grabbed the young man’s throat with his claw.</p><p>Around him, the movements of the others came to a sudden stop, stopping in the air.</p><p>“Brat, let me go, or I’ll make you die without a burial ground!”</p><p>The young man roared and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>He felt very aggrieved. At this time, he was in the air and Lu Ming had grabbed his vital parts. He had a body full of inscription Dao but he could not use it.</p><p>“Your life is in my hands, and you still dare to threaten me? I only need to use a little force now and you’ll be dead!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and a cold killing intent emanated from his body. The young man felt a chill run down his spine as if he was about to face death in the next moment.</p><p>His heart trembled, and he didn’t dare to say anything more.</p><p>The giant wolf puppet flew over. Lu Ming carried the young man and stepped onto the back of the giant wolf puppet.</p><p>“If you let me go, I’ll naturally let him go!”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll let you go!”</p><p>let’s go! the elder said without hesitation. The crowd parted to create a path for Lu Ming to fly through.</p><p>“Now, quickly release Chi Feng!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Chi Feng was this young man.</p><p>“What’s the hurry? I’ll let him go after I’ve flown some distance!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the giant wolf puppet and flew forward. After flying for a hundred miles, Lu Ming threw the Scarlet peak out and continued flying.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Chi Feng growled as he looked at Lu Ming’s departing figure. His eyes were filled with hatred.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way and very soon, he had covered a distance of ten thousand miles. Along the way, he did not encounter any underground humans.</p><p>Ten thousand miles ahead, two Crimson cheetah puppets were flying in the air.</p><p>The two cheetah puppets were both equivalent to the spiritual ocean tier, and were both at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>On one of the cheetah puppets was a young woman in her twenties. She had a curvaceous figure, and some of her important parts were wrapped in animal skin, while the rest of her skin was exposed.</p><p>Her skin was bronze in color, and although she wasn’t extremely beautiful, she was full of wildness and had a different kind of beauty.</p><p>On the other cheetah puppet, there was an old man.</p><p>“Miss, it’s too dangerous for you to come out alone like this. Let’s go back!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>elder Chi Xu, it’s fine. Don’t worry. Just now, there was news from Chi Feng that there was a young man from the outer realm who was extremely proficient in the Dao of inscription. It’s really interesting. Perhaps he is the legendary destined person. I must find him!</p><p>The young woman’s eyes flickered as if she was very curious.</p><p>young miss, according to the news, that person’s battle prowess is extremely powerful, and he’s also controlling a fourth level divine level puppet. If we encounter him, we’ll most likely be in danger. It’s better for us to return to the group!</p><p>Elder Redbeard continued to persuade.</p><p>don’t worry, I won’t do anything to him. I just want to invite him back to our tribe. If I follow the main group, I’ll scare him away. How can we talk? how can we persuade him to come back to our tribe with me? ”</p><p>The young woman didn’t listen at all, her eyes looking around.</p><p>The old man sighed. He knew that he couldn’t persuade this stubborn young lady, so he could only follow her closely.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the puppet and flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, they had flown another ten thousand miles.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, he noticed that two cheetah puppets had appeared in front of him. On the puppets, there was a young woman and an old man.</p><p>The other party had obviously seen him as well.</p><p>“I found him, I found him!”</p><p>The young woman cheered and controlled the puppet to fly toward Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>“Miss, be careful!”</p><p>The old man followed closely.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He could sense that the two puppets were not simple. He immediately controlled the giant wolf puppet to change direction and fly away.</p><p>hey, brother, don’t go! We don’t have any bad intentions. Don’t go!</p><p>The young woman shouted and controlled the puppet to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word and continued to fly forward.</p><p>“This brother, we really don’t have any ill intentions. Please stop and have a chat with me. I just want to ask you to return to the tribe and help us with something. We will definitely treat you as an honored guest.”</p><p>The woman called out, chasing after him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had flown for tens of thousands of miles. Lu Ming had changed directions a few times, but the woman and the elder were still following closely behind.</p><p>They were all puppets at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and their speed was about the same.</p><p>That woman was like a dog-skin plaster that he couldn’t shake off.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He suddenly controlled the puppet to stop and turned to look at the woman and the old man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
