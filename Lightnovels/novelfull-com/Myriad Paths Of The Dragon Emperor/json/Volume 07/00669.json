It was bright and resplendent as it floated in the air.</p><p>...</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded, and then it went silent.</p><p>It was obvious that the Dragon’s Roar had come from the flood Dragon.</p><p>seven colored Island? is that the legendary seven colored Island? ”</p><p>An old man with white hair suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>“What? The seven colored Island, you mean the seven colored Daoist’s seven colored Island?”</p><p>Some people widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>“That’s right, this looks like the seven-colored Daoist’s seven-colored Island.”</p><p>“Heavens, it can’t be true, right? the seven-colored Daoist is a legendary seventh-grade Daoist. He’s an inscription master, and a peerless expert of the spirit embryo realm at that. Legend has it that the seven-colored Daoist died eight hundred years ago, and his seven-colored Island disappeared without a trace.”</p><p>“If this really is the seven-colored Daoist’s seven-colored Island, how many treasures are there?”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Countless people’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>Only when one’s cultivation reached the spirit embryo realm could one be called a perfected being.</p><p>Normally, spiritual ocean tier Warriors were called spiritualists, just like the frost saber spiritualist, but less people used them.</p><p>As for those at the spirit embryo realm, they were revered as perfected beings.</p><p>Spiritual God Realm was known as Supreme realm.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist was a spirit embryo realm expert, but this was not his most famous achievement. He was most famous for being a seventh-grade true inscription Alchemist.</p><p>This identity was terrifying.</p><p>True Ming refinement Masters were extremely rare. Be it their identity or status, they were not to be underestimated.</p><p>A seventh-grade true inscription Alchemist was comparable to a peerless master in the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Back then, the seven-colored Daoist practically dominated the chaotic Astral Ocean. Even some super large domains knew of his name.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist’s most famous treasure was the seven-colored Island. It was an Island, a plane, and a treasure that could escape into the void and wander around.</p><p>When the seven-colored Daoist fell, everyone thought that the seven-colored Island would disappear into the void and never appear again.</p><p>And now, it had appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Sea of Souls realm Warriors were the first to react. They turned into rainbow lights and flew toward the seven-colored Island.</p><p>seven colored Island, it’s definitely a seven colored Island. Let’s go!</p><p>Countless Warriors turned into beams of light and flew toward the rainbow Island.</p><p>The figures on the shore disappeared.</p><p>“It seems like a treasure has appeared.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had never heard of the seven-colored Daoist’s name before. However, he knew that he was extraordinary from how excited the others were.</p><p>However, refining the blood essence was more important now. As for the treasures, he could only wait.</p><p>“Let’s return to the city first!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing flew back to the city. They randomly found a room and rushed in. Xie nianqing stood outside the room to protect Lu Ming.</p><p>With a single thought, he appeared in the Supreme shrine. He sat cross-legged and began to refine the blood essence with all his might.</p><p>The blood essence of more than fifty peak-tier Kings, as well as the blood essence of a sea of soul realm giant snake … The power of this blood essence was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming put all his effort into refining it.</p><p>The power of everyone’s blood essence surged towards the second bloodline.</p><p>The second blood Meridian appeared above Lu Ming’s head. It had eight silver Meridian cycles. Seven of them were extremely bright, while the eighth one was dimmer.</p><p>On the stone tablet, clouds and mist lingered. However, at the very front, the clouds and mist were already very faint. Two words could be clearly seen. One was ‘suppress’, and the other was’ tablet’. There was another word in the middle, but it was blocked and could not be seen clearly.</p><p>As Lu Ming continued to refine his blood essence, the power of the blood essence surged into his second blood Meridian. The eighth Meridian cycle of the second blood Meridian also continued to shine brightly.</p><p>Two hours later, his eighth chakra was as brilliant as the other chakras.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine the blood essence.</p><p>In the sky ten thousand miles away from the city, a brilliant ball was floating in the air.</p><p>This ball had a diameter of about a hundred miles. This was the seven colored Island. It was completely wrapped in a layer of light, and the situation inside could not be seen clearly.</p><p>More than 100000 martial artists were surrounding the round ball.</p><p>“The seven colored Island is protected by the inscription battle. Only peak-tier Kings can break through this barrier. We can’t get in at all.”</p><p>f * ck, the treasure Mountain is right in front of us, but we can only stare at it. How unlucky!</p><p>there’s nothing we can do. We’re too weak. Peak-tier Kings and sea of soul realm experts have all rushed in.</p><p>“Someone’s coming again!”</p><p>A ray of light cut through the void and appeared on the edge of the seven-colored Island. It was a burly man in a red robe.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would have recognized the red-robed man as the patriarch of the cloud Sea alchemy institution.</p><p>He didn’t appear in the battle just now, but he did now.</p><p>haha, that battle actually led to the seven-colored Island. I can’t miss such an opportunity!</p><p>The sea Cloud alchemy division’s patriarch chuckled. With a wave of his palm, he pierced through the light curtain. His body moved and he rushed in. Then, the light curtain closed.</p><p>who’s that person? he didn’t appear during the battle just now, but now that he’s seen a treasure, he’s here. How shameless!</p><p>Someone coldly snorted.</p><p>I don’t know. I don’t recognize him. He’s probably a new Almighty.</p><p>Someone shook his head.</p><p>……</p><p>Time flew by and soon, more than ten hours had passed. Lu Ming had been refining the blood essence and more than half of the blood essence had been devoured. On his second bloodline, eight silver chakra were extremely dazzling.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a silver Meridian cycle emerged above the eight Meridian cycles.</p><p>The ninth chakra.</p><p>The ninth level of the king level. Lu Ming’s second bloodline had been promoted to the ninth level of the king level, becoming the highest level of the king level bloodline.</p><p>The next step would be the divine bloodline. However, it would be too difficult to advance to the divine bloodline at the ninth level of the king tier. Lu Ming was not confident.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the second bloodline advanced to the ninth level of the king class, the stone tablet began to shake slightly. The mist surrounding the stone tablet slowly became lighter, and the word in the middle became clearer and clearer.</p><p>Finally, he saw it clearly.</p><p>Prison. The word in the middle was ‘prison’.</p><p>The prison-guarding stele!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming could see the three words clearly, they suddenly emitted a dazzling brilliance. Lu Ming seemed to have arrived at an endless land. The land was desolate, without the sun, moon, stars, flowers, trees, or any living creature. It was deathly silent.</p><p>On the deathly silent land, a stone tablet stood tall. It was infinitely tall, reaching the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Lu Ming saw three big words on the stone tablet. The prison-guarding stele!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt an explosion in his mind. A message rushed into his mind. At this moment, the scene changed. Lu Ming was still in the Supreme shrine, and the three words ‘prison suppressing stele’ on the stone tablet had calmed down and no longer emitted light.</p><p>It was as if nothing had happened. However, Lu Ming discovered that there was indeed a new piece of information in his mind.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art!</p><p>A martial technique appeared in his mind, a martial technique related to the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>is this a bloodline martial technique? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he revealed a look of joy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
