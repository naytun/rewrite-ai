There was actually such a strong person behind Lu Ming?</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, they could not help but re-examine Lu Ming.</p><p>It seemed like this young man who came from a remote village in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region was not as simple as they had thought.</p><p>His own battle prowess was unrivaled, and he had even surpassed the realm of the sacred constellation. Now, a terrifying expert of unknown cultivation had appeared behind him. How could this background be simple?</p><p>“Your Excellency, Who are you? I’m a direct descendant of the Shangguan clan from the main palace of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. This is a matter of my Shangguan clan, so I hope you won’t meddle in our business!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen said as he stared at the blurry figure above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>However, the voice just stood there without moving or speaking.</p><p>“Second brother, attack! Keep attacking! This is just a shadow, and it has limited energy. Today, this little bastard must die. No matter who is behind him, we are the disciples of the Shangguan clan. How dare he touch us?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed.</p><p>“Sir, since you’re determined to protect this kid, you must be prepared to become the enemy of the Shangguan family!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen spoke again.</p><p>“Hahaha! You want to be the enemy of the Shangguan family? So what? Don’t try to scare me with that Bullsh * t Shangguan family.”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh suddenly came from the sky.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. When did someone appear in the sky?</p><p>Especially Shangguan wuchen, Sheng Cang, and mu Tian, the three sea of soul realm experts, their expressions changed drastically. A person had appeared above their heads, and they couldn’t even sense a trace of his aura.</p><p>Everyone raised their heads to look at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, a figure was sitting in the void. He was holding a gourd and drinking wine.</p><p>“Senior Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in joy.</p><p>“Your Excellency, Who are you? Although you have a profound cultivation base and I admit that I’m no match for you, if you really offend my Shangguan family for this kid, I’m afraid that it will bring you unnecessary trouble.”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen continued, his tone still full of threat.</p><p>However, he didn’t notice that Sheng Cang, mu Tian, mu Yi, mu Zheng, and the other elders of the Tianxuan region were all stunned. They looked at the figure in the sky with surprise and complex emotions.</p><p>“Shangguan, let’s just forget about today’s matter!”</p><p>At this moment, Sheng Cang spoke to Shangguan Wu Chen.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen was stunned.</p><p>“Sheng Cang, what did you say? The one who was seriously injured and humiliated today is your own son, and you actually want to forget about it? are you even a man?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling glared at Sheng Cang and shouted.</p><p>“Alright, I’m doing this for your own good!”</p><p>Sheng Cang said.</p><p>“Who is he?” At this moment, Shangguan Wu Chen spoke. He felt that Sheng Cang should know the other party.</p><p>“He is Yan Kuang tu!”</p><p>Sheng Cang said with a complicated tone. He didn’t lower his voice, so everyone heard him.</p><p>Silence! The entire place fell silent.</p><p>All eyes were on the unruly figure in the sky.</p><p>Yan Kuang tu! He was a legend in the Tianxuan region, and even in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>In the Ditian divine Palace of the Tianxuan region, it could be said that there was no one who didn’t know about it.</p><p>He was a peerless heaven’s favorite from the Tianxuan region a hundred years ago. Many of the older generation had watched him grow up, but most of them had never seen Yan kuangtu before. At this moment, they were naturally staring at this legendary figure with wide eyes.</p><p>Slowly, many people became excited. They discussed excitedly and looked at the figure in the sky.</p><p>“Yan Kuang tu?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen’s eyes were also filled with shock.</p><p>Then, he thought of what he had just said, and his face suddenly turned pale.</p><p>His words might have been useful to others, but to Yan kuangtu, they were completely useless.</p><p>What was Yan Kuang tu’s status? What cultivation level?</p><p>He was an extremely powerful and lawless man. Even the Shangguan clan’s ancestor would have to tremble in fear and behave himself in front of him.</p><p>With Shangguan wuchen’s status, it was impossible for him to meet Yan kuangtu even if he wanted to.</p><p>He also thought of some rumors about Yan Kuang tu.</p><p>It was said that Yan kuangtu was a completely lawless man. Once, a super family had provoked him, and he had directly killed his way to the family, almost exterminating them.</p><p>In the end, Martial Emperor Di Yi did not punish him.</p><p>The strength of that super family was even stronger than their Shangguan family.</p><p>The more he thought about it, the paler his face became, and he couldn’t help but break out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Lord Yan, what wind blew you here?”</p><p>Mu Tian flew up to the sky and cupped his fists in greeting.</p><p>Although mu Tian’s status was higher than Yan kuangtu’s, he was already the palace Master of the heavenly profound Palace when Yan kuangtu was still in the heavenly profound region. However, things were different now. Yan kuangtu’s status in the heavenly Emperor divine Palace was much higher than his.</p><p>When he saw Yan kuangtu, he had to address him as Lord.</p><p>“Master Yan, you haven’t been back to the Tianxuan region for decades, have you? I’ll immediately order people to prepare a banquet to welcome you!”</p><p>Sheng Cang also flew into the air and said with a smile.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took two more sips of wine and said, ” “Sheng Cang, don’t try to get close to me. Are we that close?”</p><p>Sheng Cang’s face froze and he stood there awkwardly.</p><p>Back in the Tianxuan region, Yan kuangtu and the Sheng clan could be said to be mortal enemies. They were even fiercer than Lu Ming was now. Many people of the same generation as Yan kuangtu in the Sheng clan had been beaten up by him, and many had died by his hands.</p><p>Back then, the Sheng clan had regarded Yan kuangtu as a target they must kill.</p><p>He even forced Yan kuangtu to leave the Tianxuan region and go to other large regions to train. After that, he rose rapidly, and the Sheng family dispelled all their thoughts.</p><p>Now, Yan kuangtu didn’t exterminate them, so why would he care about them?</p><p>“Yan … Master Yan, I didn’t know it was you just now, and … I’m sorry!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen also flew up to the sky and said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“You don’t know it’s me? Hehe, your Shangguan family is really arrogant. You’re bullying the weak, aren’t you? Are you bullying my young brother Lu Ming because he has no background and no one to back him up?”</p><p>“If I wasn’t prepared, he would have been killed by you!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu sneered.</p><p>no, no. I was just testing the strength of this little brother Lu!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Second brother, what are you doing? We are the disciples of the Shangguan family, why should we be afraid of him? Kill, we must kill that little bastard today. Let’s see what he dares to do to us!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed again.</p><p>“Little sister, shut up!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen was shocked and scolded.</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling had married into the Tianxuan region and had stayed there all year round. Although she had heard of Yan kuangtu’s reputation, she had no idea how terrifying he was. She had never heard of Yan kuangtu’s battle achievements.</p><p>Shangguan wuchen was really afraid that Shangguan Wu Ling would anger Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Second brother, why are you so timid? who is the Shangguan family afraid of? Kill, this little bastard, I will definitely skin him alive and make him regret hurting Xingchen!”</p><p>Her protectiveness made Shangguan Wu Ling look like a crazy hag.</p><p>“What a vicious woman!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes turned cold, and he slapped out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
