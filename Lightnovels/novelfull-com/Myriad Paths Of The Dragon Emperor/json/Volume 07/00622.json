She was extremely beautiful and had the looks to topple cities and countries.</p><p>...</p><p>She blinked her big eyes and stared at Lu Ming without blinking.</p><p>“Small … Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat at the sight of the woman. He was overjoyed.</p><p>This stunning woman was actually Xie nianqing, who had disappeared for more than a year.</p><p>She had actually appeared here now. He almost thought that he was dreaming.</p><p>“WOWO, what a beautiful woman!”</p><p>He even forgot to chew the spiritual herb as he stared at it with wide eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I thought I’d left you far behind. Not bad. I haven’t seen you for a while and you haven’t been left behind!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s crisp voice came out of his mouth.</p><p>“Little Qing, where have you been all this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming flew over. He was also very shocked.</p><p>He had already sensed that Xie nianqing’s cultivation had reached the peak-tier King realm.</p><p>This was too terrifying.</p><p>It must be noted that Lu Ming had many fortuitous encounters during this period of time, especially in the heaven realm. He had obtained a large number of profound meaning crystals and an incredible item like the path-understanding ancient tree. This allowed Lu Ming’s cultivation to soar all the way to the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s cultivation was one level higher than his, reaching the peak-tier King level. His combat strength was also extremely terrifying, much stronger than the Holy star realm. In the short exchange just now, Lu Ming did not use his full strength, but Xie nianqing might not have.</p><p>How did she cultivate?</p><p>“What’s wrong? Did you miss me?”</p><p>Xie nianqing stared at Lu Ming with his big eyes and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>of course, you and I have been husband and wife for a long time. When you suddenly disappeared, of course I missed you. I couldn’t eat or drink at all and couldn’t sleep at night!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Damn, who’s an old couple with you? Hmph, you’re taking advantage of me the moment we meet!”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled her eyes at Lu Ming. Her smiling face was flushed, but deep in her eyes, she was also very happy.</p><p>It’s been so long since we last met.</p><p>“Little Qing, seriously, where did you go? His cultivation level was actually this strong? If I didn’t work hard, I would have been surpassed by you this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sighed and said, ” “I went to a place I didn’t want to go, so I found a chance to come out.”</p><p>“Oh, did you miss me and come out to find me?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Who’s missing you? dream on!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red again and he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>shameless, this guy is shameless. Beauty, don’t listen to him. This guy says this every time he sees a beauty.</p><p>At this time, dandan cried out, her pair of black eyes darting around.</p><p>“Eh? This little turtle? Lu Ming, when did you raise a little turtle? It’s quite cute, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at dandan with his big eyes.</p><p>haha, beauty, listen carefully. I’m not an ordinary turtle. I’m the head of the top ten Battle Beasts. My combat strength is unparalleled, I’m proficient in astronomy. geography, and the Dao of inscription. Whatever you want, I can give it to you. It just so happens that I’m lacking a servant girl … Nest, kid, what are you doing?”</p><p>Dandan put her hands behind her back and looked very smug. Before she could finish her words, she was slapped back by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to slap me? Preposterous, I … I’ll bite, I’ll bite!”</p><p>Dandan glared at Lu Ming and bared her teeth. Suddenly, she pounced on Lu Ming, wanting to bite his finger.</p><p>Lu Ming pinched dandan’s head with his fingers and lifted it in the air.</p><p>Dandan’s short limbs kept struggling in the air, and her eyes were about to spit fire.</p><p>Seeing that it was about time, Lu Ming put dandan down.</p><p>“Ah, kid, you’re finished, you’re completely finished. You actually dare to pinch this Lord’s head, you’re finished.”</p><p>Dandan shouted non-stop.</p><p>sigh, I don’t have many spirit herbs recently. I have to use them sparingly!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Dandan’s scream stopped abruptly, her eyes were wide open, and her turtle shell was moving up and down, obviously angry.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>Xie nianqing laughed hysterically.</p><p>“Your pet turtle is really interesting!”</p><p>Xie nianqing laughed.</p><p>beauty, I’m not a pet. I’m fighting for the top ten …</p><p>Before it could finish its sentence, Lu Ming took out a level-five spiritual herb and threw it to it. It immediately shut up.</p><p>“Little Qing, how did you find me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It wasn’t easy to find you. I first went to the eastern branch of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and sparred with that old man mu Zheng. That old man was stubborn and didn’t say anything at first. Later on, when Jian Fengyun recognized me, that old man then said that you had returned to the blazing sun Empire. So, I came to find you. I first found Hua Chi and he said that you were in the Lu clan. I came to the Lu clan and happened to see you here.”</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed bitterly and mourned for mu Zheng. It seemed like Xie nianqing had caused a lot of trouble in the eastern Palace.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the Lu family first. My parents miss you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Why do your parents miss me?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curved into a smile, his eyes clear like autumn water.</p><p>After two years, Xie nianqing was almost twenty years old. He was even more beautiful than before.</p><p>The curves of her body were amazing. She had lost some of her youth and had a bit more mature charm. She was shockingly beautiful.</p><p>She seemed to be even more beautiful than Mu Lan and Qiu Yue.</p><p>The two of them walked side by side toward the Lu clan.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing landed in the courtyard of the Lu family’s Manor.</p><p>“Father, mother, I’m back!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Ming ‘er is back!”</p><p>Two figures walked out of the room. They were none other than Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>After more than two months, Lu Yuntian’s cultivation base had completely recovered to the martial Grandmaster realm. It had even surpassed his previous cultivation base and had advanced by leaps and bounds, reaching the seventh grade martial Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Destruction before establishment!</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s talent had always been very high. After experiencing so many things over the years, his heart of martial Dao had become strong and firm. His comprehension of martial Dao had also become very deep.</p><p>Naturally, his cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Furthermore, Lu Yuntian had comprehended the force of fire a few days ago.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s gazes swept across Lu Ming, then landed on Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them were stunned at first, but then they were overjoyed.</p><p>“Miss nianqing, it’s miss nianqing!”</p><p>Li Ping shouted.</p><p>nianqing greets uncle and Auntie. Congratulations, uncle, for recovering your cultivation!</p><p>Xie nianqing saluted. He could tell at a glance that Lu Yuntian’s cultivation had recovered.</p><p>hahaha, miss nianqing, you don’t have to be so polite. Long time no see. I’ll ask someone to prepare a banquet to welcome you back!</p><p>Lu Yuntian burst out laughing.</p><p>“Thank you, uncle!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Eh, why are you so polite this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing in surprise.</p><p>She had never been so polite in the past.</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed and glared at Lu Ming. “None of your business!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian burst out laughing.</p><p>Li Ping’s eyes scanned Xie nianqing’s body from top to bottom, looking extremely satisfied.</p><p>Soon, the banquet was served. The four of them sat down and chatted while eating.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
