His character was not bad and Lu Ming had a good impression of him.</p><p>Xie nianqing stood at the side and did not say anything. Lu Ming chatted with Jian feiliu for a while before Jian feiliu bade him farewell.</p><p>brother Lu, miss Xie, we can’t stay on the Golden sand island for long. If the spiritual practitioner han Dao recovers, he will definitely not let you go. I plan to leave the Golden sand island. What about you? ”</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Yes, we are too!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Alright then, see you again if we’re fated!”</p><p>Jian feiliu cupped his fists and disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at each other and left the place.</p><p>News of this battle was bound to spread, and it would spread even further.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were indeed planning to leave golden sand island.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had gained a lot. They needed to find a quiet place to digest their gains.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s destruction intent realm and wind intent realm were about to merge successfully. She needed to find a place to seclude herself and break through in one go.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had yet to take a good look at the prison-suppressing heavenly art that he had obtained from the prison-suppressing stele. Also, the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire was constantly being refined. He needed to go into seclusion for a period of time to properly digest it.</p><p>The two of them flew toward the West of the Golden sand island. Soon, they crossed the entire golden sand island and arrived at the Western seaside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand moved and a map appeared in his hand.</p><p>This is the map of the chaotic Astral Ocean that he bought on golden sand island. On the map, there is an ocean with countless stars in it. Those are islands.</p><p>Golden sand island was relatively close to the East.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing rose into the air and flew West. They planned to find an uninhabited island and cultivate in seclusion for a while.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left, Jian feiliu appeared on the other side of the sea.</p><p>With a move of his hand, a metal box appeared. On the metal box, inscriptions circulated and sealed the metal box.</p><p>I got this from the palace on the rainbow Island. It’s marked with the words ‘secret key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure’. I wonder if it’s real? ”</p><p>Jian feiliu murmured as his eyes glowed.</p><p>The words “Martial Emperor’s treasure” were too attractive.</p><p>regardless of whether it’s real or fake, it must be extraordinary since it’s in the seven-colored Daoist’s collection. Unfortunately, there’s an inscription formation sealing it. It looks like I’ll have to spend some time to open the seal!</p><p>After saying that, Jian feiliu put away the iron box and flew out of the great sea, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were extremely fast. After flying for two days, they finally found a deserted island.</p><p>The deserted island was not big, with a radius of less than a hundred miles, and no one lived there.</p><p>The two of them landed on the deserted island and sorted out the things they had obtained on the rainbow Island.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had obtained quite a few things this time. Supreme-grade spirit crystals, cultivation techniques, and even intent crystals were quite abundant.</p><p>Spirit herbs were the most abundant.</p><p>The two of them split it evenly, then each found a place and began to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>dandan, take advantage of this time to inscribe inscriptions above level four. Also, give me some inscription arrays. I have time to study them!</p><p>In dandan’s mind, who knew how many inscriptions and inscription formations she had mastered, so she naturally had to make good use of them.</p><p>“Exchange it with spirit herbs!”</p><p>Dandan took the opportunity to ask for spirit herbs.</p><p>“Take it!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a handful of Level 5 spiritual medicine and threw it to dandan.</p><p>On the rainbow Island, Lu Ming had obtained a lot of spirit herbs and was rich.</p><p>Dandan took the spirit herb and ran off to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged, his mind sinking into his sea of consciousness.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, ten green spirit lamps were burning.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming had lit up ten green spirit lamps over the past few days and had reached the perfect stage of a fourth-level Alchemist.</p><p>Next, he was going to break through to become a fifth-rank inscriber.</p><p>Becoming a fifth-rank Alchemist was a hurdle. Once crossed, there would be a qualitative change. A true Alchemist would have terrifying combat power.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the meditation of the dark god. The core flowing flame in his sea of consciousness burned even more fiercely, continuously refining the mental fire of the seven-colored Daoist.</p><p>The spiritual fire of the seven-colored Daoist had already shrunk but there was still a lot left. In the near future, Lu Ming’s mental energy would still advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Wisps of mental energy fire floated down and fused with Lu Ming’s own mental energy fire. His mental energy fire grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Three hours later, the ten Green Mind lamps suddenly went out. Then, on the first mind lamp, a wisp of flame slowly appeared. It was a green flame.</p><p>Green mental fire, a level-five Alchemist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment the green flame appeared, Lu Ming’s mind shook and there was a loud rumble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, five halos of five colors suddenly appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At the bottom was a red ring of light. On the ring of light, there were ten evenly distributed dots that emitted a bright light like the stars.</p><p>Counting from the bottom to the top, the second Halo was orange and also had ten dots. It was extremely resplendent. The third Halo was yellow and also had ten dots. The fourth Halo was green and also had ten dots.</p><p>Only the fifth light ring was different. It was green, but there was only one dot on it.</p><p>“Spirit ring!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>As long as an inscriber reached level five, they would have a spirit ring.</p><p>Each color of the spirit ring represented the corresponding level.</p><p>For example, the bottommost ring represented a first-level Alchemist, and the ten points on top represented the number of spirit lamps lit.</p><p>In the first four levels, Lu Ming had lit up ten mental lamps. Hence, there were ten bright spots. If he only lit up Five Lamps at a certain level, there would only be five bright spots.</p><p>The spiritual ring could clearly show the cultivation state of an inscriber.</p><p>With a thought, he put away the spirit ring.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming’s mind sank into the green mental energy fire. BOOM! In an instant, Lu Ming’s mental energy extended out of his body and flew out, floating in the air.</p><p>At this moment, the entire world was colorful in his eyes.</p><p>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple …</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly sense the various colors, heaven and earth attributes, and energies.</p><p>“What a wonderful feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious. His mental energy continued to extend out. However, the further it went, the weaker the energy Lu Ming felt.</p><p>“Let’s test the power of the great inscription formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind returned and he stood up.</p><p>“Ta!” “Ta!”</p><p>He stomped on the ground, and runes appeared on the ground. These runes intersected and gathered, forming an inscription formation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As Lu Ming took his last step, a combat sword flew out of the formation and slashed at a mound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The mound was split in half.</p><p>“As expected, an inscription formation can channel the power of heaven and earth to unleash a powerful attack. Is this what a true rank 5 inscriber is? It’s indeed wonderful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
