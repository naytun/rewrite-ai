They would hold the two of them back first. The burly man in the red robe would kill Gu Huaxu first and then kill them.</p><p>They were broken one by one!</p><p>If that was the case, they would be in danger. That red-robed man wasn’t an ordinary person who had just broken through to the spiritual ocean tier, but had already reached the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier. If they fought him alone, they would only be defeated.</p><p>“Charge out and join forces with Gu Huaxu!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky demon force field, destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed his hands together, and the sky demon force field surrounded the twenty or so Masters. The destructive power of the Force field cut them up.</p><p>If there were only a few late-stage King tiers, they would have definitely been minced into meat paste. However, with the combined forces of over twenty King tiers, their auras merged together, and their formation, they were actually able to withstand the attack.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed his left palm down and a powerful devouring force erupted. It acted on the twenty-odd phenomenal success Kings and was about to devour their blood essence.</p><p>“Steady!”</p><p>One of the elders shouted. This elder had the strength of a peak-tier King.</p><p>In fact, there were eight peak-tier Kings among the twenty-odd people. Otherwise, they would not have been able to stop Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s joint attack.</p><p>“True dragon Strike, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear and a three-colored true dragon flew out, crashing toward the twenty-odd people.</p><p>block him, block him! In just a little while, the patriarch will be able to kill that person and come help us!</p><p>An old man roared.</p><p>They were also extremely shocked. Where did these young men come from? they were so strong that they did not seem to be martial King realm Warriors. They were too terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, countless people from all over the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy were looking at the battle in the sky in shock.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming executed the true dragon Strike, a beam of sword light suddenly flashed from a mountain peak below. The sword light was extremely sharp, as if it had come from beyond the heavens.</p><p>The target of the sword gleam was the same as Lu Ming. It was the experts from the cloud Sea alchemy institution.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three-colored true dragon first clashed with the attacks of the people from the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. They had never expected that there would be another sword light.</p><p>He wanted to defend, but he lacked the strength.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The sword light slashed across, and seven or eight late-stage Kings were cut in half.</p><p>The formation was broken.</p><p>As soon as the formation was broken, Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field exploded and blood splattered everywhere. A few more Masters were killed.</p><p>Cloud Sea Alchemy Academy is such a dirty and disgusting place. Today, I will destroy it!</p><p>A figure stepped into the air and appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a young man, about 25 or 26 years old. He was wearing a white robe and was handsome and elegant.</p><p>“Come and help me!”</p><p>On the other side, Gu Huaxu shouted. He couldn’t hold on any longer. He was spitting out blood and couldn’t hold on much longer.</p><p>“The two of you, I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll go help him!”</p><p>The white-robed young man turned into a sword light and attacked the red-robed man.</p><p>“Yun Luo, you old fogey, today is the day you die!”</p><p>The white-robed youth’s voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Damn it, Who are you?”</p><p>The red-robed man, Yun Luo, roared.</p><p>“Ditian Divine Guard, Li Xiaoyun, I’ve been investigating what your Cloud Sea Alchemy Academy has done for a long time. You must be destroyed!”</p><p>The white-robed young man shouted coldly as endless sword Qi burst out from his hand. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>The white-robed youth’s cultivation was also at the peak-tier King tier, but his battle-power wasn’t any weaker than Gu Huaxu, Xie nianqing, and the others.</p><p>Li Xiaoyun! He’s ranked 943rd on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Charge! Let’s break out together!”</p><p>At that moment, an old man who was Trapped in the Sky demon power field was trying to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>With the formation broken, their strength was greatly reduced. At this time, Xie nianqing had killed a few of them. The remaining ten or so people were struggling in the sky demon power field, but they couldn’t get out at all.</p><p>“Now, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and hundreds of three-colored true dragons flew out, pouncing on the experts from the cloud Sea alchemy division.</p><p>At the same time, the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline enveloped the other party through his left palm.</p><p>This was equivalent to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing working together. How could ordinary peak-tier Kings withstand this? they were instantly killed.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Drops of blood essence flew into Lu Ming’s left palm and were devoured by the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming curiously. He did not know what Lu Ming’s purpose of devouring blood essence was.</p><p>“Now, let’s go kill that old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not explain.</p><p>He couldn’t explain the bloodline of the nine Dragons yet.</p><p>As for the twenty or so storage rings, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing kept them all.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy was in an uproar.</p><p>The most powerful elders of the cloud Sea alchemy institution were all dead. They had all been killed.</p><p>Those who knew Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were even more shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s names aren’t on the list of top 1000 talents. How are they so strong? Peak-tier Kings can’t even fight back against them.”</p><p>the most terrifying one is Gu Huaxu. He’s also shockingly strong. He’s still alive under the attack of the old ancestor!</p><p>the great era is coming. I heard that in recent years, geniuses have emerged from all over the eastern barren territory. All kinds of Supreme talents have emerged like bamboo shoots after the rain, and many of them are no weaker than the geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>it’s over. The cloud Sea alchemy institution has been targeted by these monsters. It’s most likely over. We’d better leave quickly!</p><p>Some of the people who were studying alchemy here all retreated far away to avoid being implicated.</p><p>Some disciples of the cloud Sea elixir dispensary also retreated to some hidden places to watch. If the situation didn’t look right, they would leave immediately.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were already charging towards Yun Luo.</p><p>Even with Gu Huaxu and Li Xiaoyun working together, they were still not Yun Luo’s match, but they could barely hold her off.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Before Xie nianqing even arrived, the sky demon force field had already enveloped Yun Luo.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>The dazzling spear radiance turned into a three-colored true dragon and pounced toward Yun Luo.</p><p>At the same time, Gu Huaxu and Li Xiaoyun also launched their counterattacks.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yun Luo’s body trembled violently as she retreated!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Li Xiaoyun and Gu Huaxu moved and blocked his way.</p><p>The four of them surrounded Yun Luo.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re arrogant. Let’s see how arrogant you can be now.”</p><p>Gu Huaxu sneered.</p><p>Yun Luo, I’ve investigated what your Cloud Sea alchemy institution has done. From today on, the cloud Sea alchemy institution will be removed from the world!</p><p>Li Xiaoyun’s sword Qi soared into the sky, and his voice was extremely cold.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not say a word, but their cold gazes explained everything.</p><p>Countless people were shocked.</p><p>The four geniuses were going to kill a powerful being from the spirit sea today.</p><p>Furthermore, Yun Luo was a powerful being at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm. If she was killed, it would definitely be a big piece of news.</p><p>It was extremely rare for a King to kill the spirit ocean. This was because the difference between a King and the spirit ocean was too great.</p><p>Even if the four of them joined forces, it would still be extremely shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
