They launched a frenzied attack, and then turned to run.</p><p>However, there were also one or two people who were firmly held back by the great demon opposite them. They couldn’t escape at all for a while and could only roar repeatedly.</p><p>“Han Dao, don’t come over!”</p><p>Someone shouted, but the spiritual practitioner with the cold saber continued to fly toward that person with a dark face.</p><p>Although these spiritual ocean tier elites couldn’t completely stop the flood Dragon, as long as they could stop it for a short while, he would be able to escape.</p><p>“Ah, han Dao, you’re despicable!”</p><p>The man cursed.</p><p>However, the result was the same. When the spiritual practitioner han Dao rushed over, the flood Dragon followed closely behind. The human expert was not the flood Dragon’s opponent at all and was killed in a few moves. Even his body was swallowed by the flood Dragon.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The other spiritual ocean tier Warriors who had escaped didn’t dare to stay in the air, and directly flew down to join the battle.</p><p>“Hahaha, kill, kill all these humans!”</p><p>Those spiritual ocean tier demons also rushed down to the battlefield while laughing wildly.</p><p>The battlefield below was in chaos.</p><p>The addition of spiritual ocean tier Warriors caused the battlefield to become a chaotic battle.</p><p>Miserable shrieks rang out continuously as a large number of martial artists were killed by sea of soul realm beasts. There were also a large number of sea beasts that were killed by sea of soul realm martial artists.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed into the battlefield below.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>This area was wreaked havoc by a giant octopus, which was a sea of soul realm beast.</p><p>The body of the octopus was like a small mountain. Its eight tentacles danced around, and there were suction cups on each tentacle, which had a powerful attractive force.</p><p>With a wave of its eight tentacles, a large number of human warriors were sucked by the suction cups. Then, the suction cups were like huge mouths, revealing their fangs and swallowing the human warriors.</p><p>The screams rose and fell.</p><p>“Yes, Luo Xin!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Luo Xin in the crowd. At this moment, she was fleeing frantically with a group of people. Behind them, a huge tentacle was sweeping towards them.</p><p>“Ah, ah, help!”</p><p>The few people who ran to the back were sucked directly by the suction cups of the tentacles, letting out mournful screams.</p><p>“What do we do? What to do? Am I going to die Here?”</p><p>Luo Xin’s little face was pale, without a trace of blood.</p><p>She knew that she was in danger today, and she might die Here.</p><p>It was a pity that her dream of expanding the flame Chamber of Commerce had not been realized. She was going to die Here, and she was not willing to die.</p><p>However, in the face of such a huge gap in strength, what was the use of being unwilling?</p><p>A huge tentacle was waving at her. She couldn’t escape, so she closed her eyes in despair.</p><p>However, the next moment, she heard a violent boom. Immediately after, she felt her waist tighten as she was hugged by a strong arm. There was also a hot aura that kept surging towards her.</p><p>She opened her eyes in panic and saw a mask, a Shura mask.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Luo Xin’s eyes lit up. She realized that Lu Ming was holding her by the waist and her body was tightly pressed against Lu Ming’s strong body. Her heart could not help but beat faster and her face turned hot.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about them. His eyes were fixed on the huge octopus in front of him.</p><p>so strong! This octopus demon should be at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Just now, he had exchanged a blow with one of the octopus’s tentacles and was no match for it at all. The other party’s strength was too strong.</p><p>“Help, help! Lu Ming, save me!”</p><p>A loud cry was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and a faint smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>The person who was shouting for help was Chen Zhao.</p><p>He fled frantically, but behind him, a huge octopus tentacle was waving at him.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you left me in the lurch! I curse you! I curse you to die without an intact corpse!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had no intention of helping him, Chen Zhao started cursing.</p><p>Luo Xin’s gaze was also very calm. Chen Zhao had brought this upon himself. He had offended Lu Ming previously. Why would Lu Ming save him?</p><p>The tentacle sucked and held Chen Zhao in place. Chen Zhao screamed in fear and struggled desperately, but it was to no avail. The suction cup opened and swallowed Chen Zhao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated dozens of miles in an instant before he let Luo Xin go.</p><p>“Miss Luo Xin, your cultivation level is not high, so you should stay behind!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, he moved and rushed in another direction.</p><p>There, Xie nianqing was fighting a huge eel.</p><p>This eel was also one of the great demons of the spiritual sea. Its entire body was suffused with lightning, and it was extremely powerful. Its cultivation should be at the middle stage of the first level spiritual sea.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s combat power was also extremely strong. He actually had the upper hand.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in the air and arrived at the area in no time. A bright spear ray shot toward the eel.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>The eel was shocked to see Lu Ming and retreated hurriedly.</p><p>It had just seen Lu Ming kill a giant deep-sea snake. It felt that it was no match for Xie nianqing. Now that Lu Ming was added to the mix, it would be a disaster. It was no wonder it ran away.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the sky, Dragon roars could be heard. After killing the two sea of soul realm experts, the flood Dragon continued to chase after the spirit Warrior han Dao.</p><p>“Old man, I will kill you today. You can’t escape!”</p><p>The flood Dragon roared, its voice shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao was running for his life. He was actually flying toward the battlefield below.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The martial artists below were scared out of their wits as they scattered and fled.</p><p>“This old man is too despicable!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He retreated quickly with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a crimson sword light pierced through the sky and shot toward the flood Dragon.</p><p>The flood Dragon grabbed it with its claw and collided with the sword light. With a loud bang, the sword light disappeared, but the flood Dragon’s body was also blocked for a moment.</p><p>Seeing this sword light, the spiritual practitioner han Dao was overjoyed and laughed, ” Reddie, you’re finally here. You’re too slow!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Another crimson sword light slashed toward the flood Dragon. With the appearance of the sword light, six or seven figures appeared in the distance.</p><p>The person in the lead was an old man in a red robe. His aura was extremely powerful.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A beam of divine light shot out from one of the flood Dragon’s horns and blocked the sword light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air rang out as seven figures appeared in the sky above the battlefield.</p><p>Each of the seven figures exuded a powerful and terrifying aura. They were actually all powerful existences in the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Han Dao old monster, I went to find the old monster Lu Xuan for help, so I was a little late!”</p><p>The red-robed old man grinned.</p><p>“The old monster Lu Xuan has also come?”</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao’s eyes flashed and fell on an old man in a green robe beside Hong Chi. He immediately became overjoyed and said, ” “Good, good, the three of us will join forces and kill this flood Dragon!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
