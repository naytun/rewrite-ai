It slowly merged with Lu Ming’s mental energy fire and was mastered by him.</p><p>Lu Ming simply wanted to laugh out loud.</p><p>It was an opportunity, a Supreme opportunity.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had only cultivated the inscription Dao for a short period of time. Although his mental energy fire was perfect at every level, he was still lacking in experience and knowledge.</p><p>Although he had mastered millions of level one, level two, and level three inscriptions given to him by dandan, he did not know how to combine them or how to use them.</p><p>This was something that had to be explored slowly. This was experience.</p><p>Now, however, he had refined the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire and integrated it with his experience.</p><p>Although the experience points were still scattered, as long as Lu Ming refined more and more mental energy flames from the seven-colored Daoist, he would definitely gain more experience points.</p><p>His knowledge of the Dao of inscription would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Although the true dragon’s blood had already been burned dry by the seven-colored Daoist, it was enough for him to obtain such an opportunity.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was even more precious than a ball of true dragon’s blood.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, refining the mental energy fire was not something that could be done in a short period of time. He was refining it at all times and Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was improving at all times.</p><p>“Haha, kid, you’ve earned big this time, haven’t you?”</p><p>Dandan laughed when she saw Lu Ming opening his eyes.</p><p>“Not bad, we’ve indeed earned big!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was still blushing. He blinked his big eyes at Lu Ming and then looked in other directions, as if he did not dare to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>hey, little Qing, we seemed to have other things to do just now. Why don’t we continue now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing with a smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red. She knew that Lu Ming must have heard everything that had happened.</p><p>“Continue, my ass! A big pervert with a perverted turtle, they are indeed jackals of the same tribe!”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and turned away, his face red with embarrassment. He did not want to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little brat, I’m really kind this time, right? Hurry up and reward me with some spirit herbs!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>not bad, not bad. You’re a good friend this time. Here, a reward for you!</p><p>Lu Ming took out more than ten stalks of Level 5 spiritual herbs and threw them to dandan. She was overjoyed. She opened her mouth and swallowed them all.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>At the sight of this, Xie nianqing gritted his teeth. His eyes were as big as copper bells, and there was a raging fire in his eyes. He bared his fangs and brandished his claws as he pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s see what other treasures are in the hall!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly changed the topic and dashed into the hall in a flash.</p><p>After walking around the hall, he realized that there was nothing there. It was completely empty.</p><p>Where were the treasures left behind by the seven-colored Daoist after his death? What about the storage ring? Why wasn’t there any? Lu Ming was a little depressed.</p><p>If he had known earlier, he would have forced the seven-colored Daoist to tell him where the treasure was hidden before killing him.</p><p>It turned around and returned to the flood Dragon’s side.</p><p>Unfortunately, the seven-colored Daoist had burned the flood dragon’s blood and essence. Otherwise, the flood dragon’s blood essence would be a great supplement, and even the real dragon’s blood could be refined.</p><p>“This flood Dragon’s corpse is full of treasures. Put it away!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the flood Dragon’s corpse into a storage ring.</p><p>Xie nianqing followed Lu Ming angrily.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Hmph!” Xie nianqing snorted coldly. He ignored Lu Ming and walked out.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and followed him out.</p><p>When he arrived at the square, he found that the spiritual practitioner han Dao and the other man were still trapped there.</p><p>“Little bastard, stop right there! Where’s the flood Dragon? What treasure did you obtain? hand it over!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner called out as soon as he saw Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>idiot, you’re really an idiot. I think you’ve lived for so many years in vain. In this situation, you’re not kneeling down and begging me, but threatening me!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and said in disdain.</p><p>“Little bastard, what did you just say?”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao roared.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He could not be bothered to waste his breath. He replaced thousands of spiritual crystals around the formation, increasing the power of the formation.</p><p>“The two of you, enjoy your time here!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and swaggered away with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Behind them, only the spiritual practitioner han Dao and the red monster’s angry roars could be heard.</p><p>I say, dandan, that form-shifting and shadow-changing talisman of yours is quite useful. Make a few more of them when you have time.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming looked at dandan in anticipation.</p><p>alright, give me the materials. The shape Jade!</p><p>Dandan stretched out a claw and said.</p><p>shape Jade? what shape Jade? ” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Of course it’s the materials. How can I make it without the shape Jade? I saw that you didn’t have any either. I found the previous few when I saw you cleaning up other people’s storage rings, so I went over to make a few form-shifting shadow-changing talismans!”</p><p>Dandan pouted and said.</p><p>Lu Ming remembered that there was indeed a time when dandan coaxed and pestered him and took a piece of Jade from him. Initially, he thought that it was an ordinary Jade. He did not expect it to be a shape Jade.</p><p>Lu Ming, let me tell you. The shape-shifting Jade is very rare. With my current ability, I can only refine it and use it in a level-six inscription formation. The formation that the seven-colored Daoist set up is only as powerful as a normal level-six inscription formation after so many years. That’s why it can be used. So, don’t even think about using the shape-shifting shadow-changing talisman to walk through all kinds of formations. That’s not realistic!</p><p>Dandan ruthlessly attacked.</p><p>Lu Ming was depressed. He initially had that idea to let dandan refine a bunch of form-shifting and shadow-changing talismans. Then, he would not have to fear any big arrays in the future.</p><p>It seemed that there was no such thing as a free lunch in the world.</p><p>The two people and one turtle followed the original path and left the area full of inscription formations without any danger.</p><p>“Let’s go to other places and search for spirit herbs!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Following that, they chose another direction and went to search for spirit medicines.</p><p>Although the rainbow Island was huge, it was still limited. This place had already been turned over. In the next three days, although the two of them had some gains, it was not much.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire had changed drastically.</p><p>His mental energy fire was increasing rapidly at every moment.</p><p>In just three days, not only had he lit ten spirit lamps at the third rank, but he had also become a fourth rank Alchemist. Now, he had already lit eight green spirit lamps.</p><p>A fourth-level Alchemist with eight green lamps. In just three short days, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire had advanced by a whole realm.</p><p>However, he had only refined a small portion of the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire in his spiritual sea. There was still a large portion that had yet to be refined.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
