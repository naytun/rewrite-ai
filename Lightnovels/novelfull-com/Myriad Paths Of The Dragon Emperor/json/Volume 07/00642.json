These demonic beasts all had one thing in common, which was that they had extremely good endurance and huge bodies.</p><p>Each demonic beast could carry at least a few dozen people.</p><p>These demonic beasts did not all stand together. Instead, they were clearly divided into different forces.</p><p>“The Liuyuan Chamber of Commerce is going to Fengyuan Island. Each person only needs 10000 high quality spiritual crystals!”</p><p>the flame Chamber of Commerce is going to the Golden sand island. Let’s go together. 12000 Supreme spiritual crystals per person!</p><p>the huge wave Chamber of Commerce has called for guards to go to sea Lion Island.

Let’s discuss it face to face!</p><p>……</p><p>When the two of them arrived at the port, they heard shouts.</p><p>“Which island are we going to first?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>“I can do anything! Let’s choose a bigger Island!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The map displayed on the keys of the Martial Emperor’s treasure only points to the chaotic Astral Ocean, but it doesn’t point to its specific location. The two of them speculate that it will only point to its specific location when all nine keys are born. Therefore, they don’t have a specific target now, so they can only choose a random place.</p><p>then let’s go to golden sand island. Golden sand island is a Big Island with many Warriors gathered there.</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded and the two of them walked in the direction of the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“You two, are you going to golden sand island?”</p><p>A middle-aged man with a goatee asked with a smile.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>to golden sand island, 12000 best-grade spiritual crystals per person. Our young lady is there, so you can register and pay the fee there!</p><p>The goateed middle-aged man pointed.</p><p>The two of them looked over and saw a young woman, surrounded by a group of people, standing under a huge four-winged Flying Tiger.</p><p>“Alright, thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and walked over with Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Are you two going to golden sand island?”</p><p>The lady looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing with a faint smile.</p><p>The woman was in her 20s. She was wearing a light yellow long dress, which made her look pretty and lovely.</p><p>This was the young lady that the man with the goatee had mentioned.</p><p>“Yes, this is the fee for the two of us!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out 24000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals and handed them to the young lady.</p><p>The woman kept it and smiled. my name is Luo Xin. How should I address the two of you? ”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also reported their names.</p><p>young master Lu, Lady Xie, the journey to golden sand island will take half a month. You can choose a four-winged Flying Tiger first. We will set off in two hours!</p><p>Luo Xin said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, he and Xie nianqing chose a four-winged Flying Tiger.</p><p>The four-winged Flying Tiger was 20 meters tall and had a wide back. It lay there, and a few people were already sitting cross-legged on its back.</p><p>The two of them landed on the four-winged Flying Tiger’s back and sat cross-legged, waiting quietly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left, a young man with a cold expression beside Luo Xin said, ” two more useless people. This time, there are no experts on the way to golden sand island. What bad luck.</p><p>Chen Zhao, this is very normal. It’s not every time that there are powerhouses setting off together. As a caravan, we have to rely more on ourselves.</p><p>Luo Xin said.</p><p>“Of course I know that. However, if we have a strong person with us, we can save a lot of people if we run into danger.”</p><p>Chen Zhao said.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>The reason why their caravan brought people along was firstly to earn some fees, and secondly, they had the intention of borrowing strength.</p><p>If they encountered danger on the road, these people who were traveling together would also help. If there were a few experts together, it would be a great deal, and the safety factor would increase greatly.</p><p>As they were chatting, someone else came over.</p><p>Time flew by, and two hours passed.</p><p>The people of the flame trade caravan, as well as the guards, all landed on the back of the four-winged Flying Tiger.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Luo Xin shouted. The four-winged Flying Tiger let out a loud roar and immediately soared into the sky, flying towards the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming took a quick glance. There were a total of sixty four-winged Flying Tigers and each of them had about twenty people on them. In total, there were more than a thousand people.</p><p>Most of them were from the flame Chamber of Commerce. One to two hundred of them, like Lu Ming and the rest, had followed the team to the Golden sand island.</p><p>There was nothing else on the four-winged Flying Tiger’s back except for people. People would not have goods, and Warriors were naturally different from ordinary merchant caravans.</p><p>Mortal caravans usually carried a large amount of goods with them, but the goods of martial artists were all stored in storage rings.</p><p>The four-winged Flying Tiger roared as it moved. It had four huge wings that were more than 50 meters wide. When it flapped its wings, a strong wind blew, and it was extremely fast.</p><p>60 huge four-winged Flying Tigers flew thousands of meters in the air and formed a certain formation. On the four-winged Flying Tiger at the front stood a white-robed elder who was looking into the distance.</p><p>This old man was the guide of the caravan. Not only could he tell the direction, but he could also avoid thunderstorms and storms. He could be seen from far away and had never taken a detour to avoid them.</p><p>This was something that every caravan would have, and it was also called an Feng Xiang master.</p><p>An Feng Shui Master was the most valuable asset of a caravan. They could help a caravan avoid many dangers.</p><p>The salty sea breeze blew and Lu Ming felt refreshed.</p><p>“This is the real ocean!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the back of the four-winged Flying Tiger and looked into the distance.</p><p>The blue ocean was boundless, as if it was connected to the sky.</p><p>The surface of the sea was very calm. It was completely different from the sea that Lu Ming had seen in the heaven realm.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>The journey to golden sand island would take half a month, and he could use this time to cultivate.</p><p>His mind sank into his sea of consciousness and he sat cross-legged under the lightning cauldron to comprehend the lightning concept.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming ended his comprehension of the Thunder concept. He began to deduce the exploding star fist in his mind.</p><p>Time flew by and three days passed.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The sound of waves crashing could be heard from below. At the same time, chirping sounds could be heard. Lu Ming looked down and was slightly shocked.</p><p>On the surface of the sea below, there were huge black fish. Lu Ming estimated that each of them was no more than a hundred meters long. There were more than a hundred of them in total. They were rolling in the sea and letting out sharp cries.</p><p>Here in the deep sea, all kinds of sea demonic beasts gradually appeared.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Suddenly, a large part of the water sank down, revealing rows of sharp teeth. A black fish was caught off guard and was directly bitten in two by the sharp teeth. A huge shark jumped out of the water, its aura monstrous.</p><p>“What a big shark!”</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that the shark was at least a thousand meters long. It was huge and looked like a small island in the ocean.</p><p>The shark opened its mouth wide and swallowed the big fish. Then, it rushed to the other big fish. The other big fish naturally scattered and fled in all directions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
