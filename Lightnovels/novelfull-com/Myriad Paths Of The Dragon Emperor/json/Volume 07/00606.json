Let’s see how many you can break.”</p><p>...</p><p>Shangguan muttered in his heart. He flicked his finger and another stream of essential core flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other side, mu Tian furrowed his brows. The displeasure in his eyes grew. He flicked his finger as well and a stream of Qi flew out and collided with Shangguan wuchen’s Qi. The two forces canceled each other out.</p><p>Shangguan wuchen’s eyes turned cold and he said, ” “Brother mu, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>brother Shangguan, don’t go too far. As the palace Master of the Tianxuan sub-Palace, I must ensure the fairness of the duel!</p><p>Mu Tian transmitted his voice.</p><p>“Mu Tian, don’t you want to marry your daughter to Xingchen?”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen said coldly.</p><p>“That’s another matter!”</p><p>Mu Tian transmitted his voice, his attitude unyielding.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a few steps forward, crossing the void and heading toward the sacred planet.</p><p>He wanted to end the battle quickly, but who knew if another burst of true essence would come?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven-treading steps took three steps in a row, and a violent force blasted toward the Holy star.</p><p>Sheng Xingchen was seriously injured. How could he resist it? he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The other people present were all stunned, and they couldn’t think straight.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had the upper hand and was about to win. Suddenly, his combat strength was greatly reduced and he was suppressed by sacred constellation. However, Lu Ming suddenly erupted again and seriously injured sacred constellation.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He held the spear with both hands and the huge Spear’s gleam smashed down on the sacred constellation.</p><p>“Stop! This battle is considered a draw!”</p><p>A loud roar suddenly rang out and reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>It was Shangguan Wu Chen’s voice.</p><p>“A draw?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. The Spear’s gleam did not stop at all.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This spear heavily smashed into Sheng Xingchen’s body. He screamed and fell to the ground like a meteorite. Finally, he heavily smashed into the true Yuan light screen like a chick falling on it, causing a large amount of blood to spray out.</p><p>The true Yuan light screen trembled violently, and the Holy star lay on it like a pile of mud.</p><p>Although he was not dead, he did not know how many of the bones in his body had been broken.</p><p>The entire place was silent, and the air seemed to have frozen.</p><p>Did Lu Ming win?</p><p>“The stars!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed and rushed down from the stands to the side of the sacred constellation.</p><p>little bastard, little b * stard, how dare you hurt Xingchen so badly? die, I want you to die. Men, skin this little b * stard and throw him to the dogs!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling let out a bitter scream.</p><p>Immediately, some elders of the Sheng family burst out with powerful auras.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Does the Tian Xuan region really belong to your Sheng family?”</p><p>Mu Zheng stood up and shouted, his aura erupting.</p><p>“Sixth brother, what are you doing? This is the Sheng family’s business, why are you interfering?”</p><p>Mu Yi said coldly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>shut up! mu Zheng shouted. Then, he strode forward and stared at the Sheng clan. Some of the MU clan elders who were close to mu Zheng also stood with him and stared at the Sheng clan.</p><p>Mu Yi’s expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>At that moment, the sacred constellation spat out another mouthful of blood and looked at Lu Ming with resentment.</p><p>“Sacred constellation, you’ve lost. You don’t have the right to marry Senior Sister Mu Lan.”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the sacred constellation and said slowly.</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes were a little moist. Lu Ming, did he finally do it? He had finally defeated sacred constellation.</p><p>When she was young, Mu Lan had said in front of sacred constellation, mu Tian, and Sheng Cang that she wanted to find someone to defeat sacred constellation and prove that sacred constellation was not worthy of her.</p><p>She would have a better choice.</p><p>At that time, mu Tian, Sheng Cang, and the rest had treated Mu Lan’s words as a joke and had agreed to it. Who would have thought that such a day would come?</p><p>“Lu Ming, one day, I’ll trample you under my feet and cut off your head.”</p><p>Holy constellation stared at Lu Ming with resentment and hissed.</p><p>After this battle, his reputation would hit rock bottom.</p><p>hehe, Holy constellation, I remember that half a year ago, you said that you would let me know what despair is. I would never be able to catch up to you in my entire life. How about now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Half a year later, I’ll let you know what despair is. You’ll never be able to catch up to my footsteps.</p><p>These words had been said by the sacred constellation half a year ago, and many people still remembered them.</p><p>The past was still vivid in his mind. However, half a year later, not only did Lu Ming catch up to him, but he also defeated him in a domineering manner. How ironic was it when he recalled this sentence now?</p><p>Holy constellation’s face was extremely gloomy, but he could not refute.</p><p>“Now, I’ll give you a sentence. Today, I can defeat you, but in the future, you will never be able to catch up to me. From now on, you, the sacred constellation, are no longer worthy of being my opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was calm, but everyone could hear his strong self-confidence and unshakable determination in his martial arts.</p><p>In front of everyone’s eyes, it was as if they were seeing a peerless genius, showing off his brilliance in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Holy constellation’s chest heaved up and down rapidly, and he almost spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, a terrifying energy began to spread out, pressing down on everyone’s hearts like a vast ocean.</p><p>Instantly, everyone felt breathless and their hearts beat faster.</p><p>They looked in shock at the place where the aura had erupted.</p><p>It was Shangguan Wu Chen.</p><p>Shangguan wuchen stood up with a gloomy face. The aura on his body was as deep and vast as the ocean.</p><p>“What future? you have no future!”</p><p>I told you to stop and end it in a draw. This was the best ending, but you didn’t listen. You’re seeking your own death!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen spoke in a gloomy voice. Every word was full of killing intent.</p><p>“A draw? What a joke, do you think everyone here is a fool?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning. He looked at Shangguan wuchen fearlessly.</p><p>He did not believe that Shangguan Wu Chen would dare to lay a hand on him with so many people present.</p><p>hehe, they’re not fools, but in front of the Shangguan family, they have to be fools!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen sneered and stepped on the air.</p><p>His words were overbearing and overbearing.</p><p>The rest of the people had unsightly expressions on their faces, but when they thought of the Shangguan family’s power, they all kept their mouths shut.</p><p>“Second brother, kill him! Kill this little b * stard!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed.</p><p>“Today, you will die!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen’s words were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and he felt all the hair on his body stand on end. Shangguan wuchen was really going to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core circulated rapidly, raising his aura to the maximum, ready to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Brother Shangguan, don’t go too far!”</p><p>At this moment, mu Tian stood up and said in a dignified voice. A powerful aura enveloped Shangguan Wu Chen.</p><p>“Mu Tian, what are you doing? Is your Mu family trying to go against my Shangguan family? Can you afford the price?”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen looked at mu Tian, still as domineering as ever.</p><p>“Big brother, don’t be silly!”</p><p>Mu Yi said from the side.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Mu Tian coldly rebuked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
