Everyone’s eyes were wide open, staring at the battle platform and Lu Ming’s figure.</p><p>...</p><p>Demonic wind had been killed by a single strike.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually fused three concepts. Was this his true strength? It was too terrifying.</p><p>Or perhaps, this was not Lu Ming’s true ability.</p><p>After the silence, there was an intense clamor. Some people were discussing excitedly, while others were screaming in excitement.</p><p>“Is this his true strength?”</p><p>Luo Xin whispered, her eyes full of disbelief.</p><p>Beside her, Chen Zhao’s body trembled violently out of fear and shock.</p><p>It turned out that ever since he had met Lu Ming, Lu Ming had never revealed his true abilities. What he had seen was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Even though he had repeatedly provoked Lu Ming, Lu Ming did not reveal his strength to kill him.</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming did not even care to show off his strength in front of him. He even did not care to kill him.</p><p>Perhaps, in Lu Ming’s eyes, he was no different from a wild dog that was barking by the roadside. He did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>When he thought of this, his heart was filled with a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p>His big brother, whom he had always been proud of, would probably be defeated in one move in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>In the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and devoured the blood essence of demonic wind. At the same time, the storage ring naturally fell into his hands.</p><p>“Who else is there? You’re willing to come up and fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s clear voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>What a joke. Even an old monster like demonic wind was dead. No one else would be willing to go up and court death.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for two minutes. He swept his gaze and was about to leave the stage when he saw that no one was going on stage.</p><p>“The King of Hell is here!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>The entire place quieted down. Then, it was filled with an earth-shattering uproar.</p><p>“What? The King of Hell is here, where is he?”</p><p>“Really? where?”</p><p>“The main entrance, look!”</p><p>After some noise, everyone’s eyes looked in the direction of the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he looked in that direction as well.</p><p>A black-robed man wearing a Yama mask walked in step by step.</p><p>As he took one step after another, he slowly stepped into the void and appeared at the edge of the fighting ring. On his mask, two sharp eyes were looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked at him.</p><p>Everyone’s heart suddenly began to race.</p><p>is the King of Hell going to challenge the Asura? ”</p><p>“It’s possible, it’s possible. Hell King has disappeared for so many days and he has finally reappeared. It’s rare for a strong opponent to appear. Perhaps he’s really going to make a move.”</p><p>“Heavens, King Yama against Asura, who is stronger? I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>“I am indeed looking forward to it. Ever since the rise of King Yama, he has never tasted defeat. He has killed a few old monsters. However, no one knows how strong Asura is. I don’t think he has used his full strength to kill demonic wind.”</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of pairs of eyes were staring at Lu Ming and the King of Hell with anticipation.</p><p>The King of Hell versus the Asura. This would be a battle of the peak.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword resounded. Hell King’s aura suddenly increased dramatically, and his body emitted a dazzling golden light. A golden sword light shot into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, a powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body as if he was drawn by the aura. A Spear’s gleam soared into the sky.</p><p>Then, the sword light and the spear light met in the air and hit each other.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded, and the force swept in all directions.</p><p>Just the clash of auras was already shocking enough.</p><p>“Is there really going to be a Great War?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone held their breath and stared at it with wide eyes.</p><p>However, to their disappointment, after the clash of auras between the King of Hell and Asura, they did not make a move.</p><p>Asura stood on the fighting stage while Yama stood in the air. They were not fighting.</p><p>“This person is so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright like two divine Spears that pierced through the air.</p><p>He could sense immense pressure from the King of Hell. Lu Ming had never felt this way from a martial artist of the same level.</p><p>The King of Hell was definitely a terrifying opponent.</p><p>At the same time, the King of Hell’s eyes glowed with a golden light, as if two golden swords were about to burst out. He did not move, for he could feel the strong pressure from Lu Ming.</p><p>He was not confident either. He had a feeling that if they were to fight, one of them would definitely die. Moreover, he was not sure if he would be the one to win.</p><p>Hell King was also surprised. He didn’t expect to meet such a strong opponent here. Even in the entire East continent, there were not many opponents like him.</p><p>The two of them confronted each other for a while. Suddenly, the King of Hell’s aura was retracted. At the same time, Lu Ming’s aura was also retracted.</p><p>Without saying anything else, hell King turned around and went back.</p><p>“I don’t want to fight anymore!”</p><p>Most of the people were greatly disappointed. They had thought that there would be a peak battle.</p><p>the two of them are too strong. No one has the confidence to defeat the other!</p><p>that’s right. Without a doubt, they’re both peerless heaven’s favorites. Even on the list of top 1000 talents, they won’t be too far behind. They’re evenly matched!</p><p>Someone from the older generation spoke up and saw the reason.</p><p>Many people sighed. They couldn’t see a peak battle.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a bell could be heard.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Before the first bell had even finished, the second one rang out immediately after. It sounded very urgent.</p><p>At the scene, most of the People’s faces changed drastically.</p><p>“Alarm, why did the alarm ring?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Sea beasts attacking the island, sea beasts attacking the island!”</p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shattering roar came from outside the fate battle platform. The roar was like a storm, sweeping through the entire city and spreading to the distance.</p><p>“What? The sea beasts are attacking the island!”</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>the sea beasts are attacking the island. The beast tide is coming. Everyone, head to the eastern sea region and snipe the sea beasts!</p><p>That voice rang out again, rumbling in the air.</p><p>The owner of the voice had a terrifying cultivation base, and was definitely a sea of soul realm expert.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At the same time, the alarm bell rang continuously in a very urgent manner.</p><p>“Let’s go to the East!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The audience around the battle stage rose into the air like a swarm of locusts and flew toward the gap above.</p><p>“The sea beasts are attacking the island!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>A figure appeared beside Lu Ming. It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. Together with Lu Ming, they rose into the air, mixed in with the crowd, and headed for the eastern sea.</p><p>Countless figures flew out of the city, covering the sky and earth as they flew toward the eastern sea.</p><p>Not only in the city, but also from the mountains around the city, a large number of experts flew out and flew toward the eastern sea.</p><p>Whenever they encountered a beast tide or sea beasts attacking the island, all the martial artists had to unite and attack together.</p><p>This is a rule that has been established in the chaotic Astral Ocean for a long time. Otherwise, these islands would have long been ravaged by sea beasts.</p><p>This city was very close to the eastern sea region. They arrived in less than a minute.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
