His purpose was to attract others to fight. If his performance was too strong, how would the others dare to go up the stage?</p><p>Now, the red-haired man was on the stage.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>The red-haired man asked.</p><p>“Shura!” Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>“Shura? Hehe! Kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the red-haired burly man made his move. A flaming saber ray that was a thousand meters long and incomparably hot slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. The explosive fist force collided with the other party’s saber flare, shaking the fighting ring.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force was actually destroyed. The scorching saber ray continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!” The red-haired man’s body was covered in blazing flames, and his face was extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Your combat strength is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>This red-haired man’s battle-power was much stronger than the big-eyed old man’s. No wonder he dared to go on stage.</p><p>“Then let’s add two more points!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and threw another punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This fist force was twice as strong as the previous one. It broke through the red-haired man’s Saber Light and continued to attack him.</p><p>“Ah, you were hiding your strength just now!”</p><p>The red-haired man roared and revealed a look of fear. He burst out with all his strength and madly slashed with his saber.</p><p>However, the result was the same. Just like the big-eyed elder, he was completely suppressed by Lu Ming. After a few dozen moves, he was killed by Lu Ming with one punch.</p><p>“The exploding star fist is approaching the third level!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and put away the storage ring. He also devoured the red-haired hunk’s blood essence.</p><p>After devouring the blood essence of two peak-tier Kings, the nine Dragon bloodline began to rumble.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the fighting ring and began to refine his blood essence while waiting for other people to challenge him.</p><p>The surroundings fell silent. For a moment, no one stepped forward.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had killed two people in a row and obtained their storage rings, the others could not figure out Lu Ming’s combat strength at the moment.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Chen Zhao snorted coldly, his expression ugly.</p><p>He said that it would be considered good if Lu Ming could win one round. However, Lu Ming had already won two rounds in a row. This made him very unhappy.</p><p>Two minutes. Lu Ming stood in the fighting ring for two minutes. He used the power of blood essence in the nine Dragon bloodline to upgrade his second bloodline.</p><p>The amount of blood essence required for the nine Dragon bloodline to advance to the ninth level of the king class was too much. Lu Ming planned to advance his second bloodline to the eighth level of the king class first before he advanced his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed up the fighting ring. It was a tall and thin middle-aged man.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted. Finally, someone else went up the stage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the middle-aged man.</p><p>Asura, your fist force is very powerful, but as long as I don’t take it head-on, I’ll see what you can do!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the expert’s figure moved and turned into a series of shadows, pouncing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the tall and thin man had already turned into eighteen shadows and surrounded Lu Ming. The sharp sword aura pierced through the air and was aimed at Lu Ming’s vital points.</p><p>Eighteen shadows and eighteen flashes of sword Qi were extremely sharp.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few punches in succession, hitting a few figures. The few figures collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>“Phantom!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He dodged the sword Qi attack and punched out with both fists.</p><p>One after another, the fist force pierced through the void and landed on the figures. In the blink of an eye, seven or eight figures collapsed, but they were all illusions and not corporeal.</p><p>The remaining figures moved again and continued to pounce on Lu Ming. In the process of pouncing, the number of illusions increased again, and there were eighteen of them.</p><p>Every one of them looked real, and even their auras were exactly the same.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>The eighteen figures sneered at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure dodged continuously, avoiding the attacks. At the same time, he continued to blast out his fist force.</p><p>The tall, thin man’s illusion was constantly being shattered, but after each time it was shattered, it would recover.</p><p>The two of them were in a state of anxiety, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than 50 moves.</p><p>“It seems that the Shura has met his match!”</p><p>that’s right. The Shura’s Zhen Yuan is rich, and his fist force is powerful and overbearing. However, his weakness is also obvious. The other party is using an unpredictable movement technique to tie him down, so his fist force is useless.</p><p>wearing an Asura mask to imitate the King of Hell is not on the same level after all. The difference is too great!</p><p>The surrounding audience expressed their opinions one after another.</p><p>In the process of their discussion, dozens of moves had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that his circulation of the exploding star fist was becoming more and more smooth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, he threw a punch, which was much more powerful than before.</p><p>The tall and thin man was shocked.</p><p>haha, I’ve finally reached the third level of the exploding star fist. It’s time to end this battle!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in his heart.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the fighting ring and soared into the sky. He then looked down from high above and blasted out a series of fist forces.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had thrown dozens of punches. Dozens of fist forces streaked across the sky like dozens of meteors and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>And the power of each one was stronger than before.</p><p>“So many!”</p><p>The tall and thin man was shocked. He tried his best to Dodge, but there were still illusions that dissipated.</p><p>18 became 17,16 …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there were only two or three left.</p><p>Just as he was about to continue changing his form, dozens of fist forces came crashing down from the sky.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The tall and thin man roared. In the next moment, he was drowned by dozens of fist forces.</p><p>The fighting ring let out a violent roar. When the fist force disappeared, the tall and thin man was lying there like a pool of mud, without the slightest breath.</p><p>Just like before, the blood essence and the storage ring would all belong to Lu Ming.</p><p>Three consecutive wins. Lu Ming had already won three consecutive wins.</p><p>Moreover, they won in a row, not in a few days. Many people’s winning streak was actually the sum of many days. Just like Chen Dao, he occasionally came to fight and added up his winning streak.</p><p>It was very difficult to win in a short period of time, because continuous battles consumed a lot of true Yuan, and the challengers would only get stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Who’s going to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to look around.</p><p>hehe, that’s enough, that’s enough. You’ve already obtained three storage rings. Now, it’s my turn to deal with you!</p><p>A sneer was heard, and a red figure appeared on the fighting ring in a flash.</p><p>it’s Xue gang! He’s going to attack again!</p><p>looks like he’s been waiting all this time. Now that he’s seen Asura win three rounds in a row, he’s finally making his move!</p><p>I just don’t know if Asura dares to accept the challenge. Xue gang, he just defeated Chen Dao!</p><p>Cries of alarm came from all around.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
