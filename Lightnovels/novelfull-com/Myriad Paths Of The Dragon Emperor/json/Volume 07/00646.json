Their eyes were red from killing.</p><p>They had thought that they would die today, but the situation had suddenly reversed, and the morale was high.</p><p>In just a few minutes, a few hundred Blood Fiend Pirates had been killed.</p><p>Finally, the blood Fiend Pirates collapsed and retreated.</p><p>Xie nianqing and the others chased after him madly, leaving behind a large number of corpses along the way.</p><p>Of the one thousand Blood Fiend Pirates, at least eight hundred were killed. Only one or two hundred managed to escape.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force was like a rainbow. The terrifying and powerful fist force cut through the void like a meteor, constantly blasting towards the knife-scarred man and the thin bamboo pole. It was as if there was no end to it.</p><p>The knife-scarred man and the skinny man were already trembling, and blood was flowing out of their mouths and noses.</p><p>Their internal organs had been injured by Lu Ming’s fist force.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the circulation of the explosive star fist was becoming smoother and smoother. It was much more comfortable than when he had comprehended it by himself.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the level of the explosive star fist was approaching the third level.</p><p>The cultivation of martial techniques still required a great battle.</p><p>The knife-scarred man and the skinny man watched as their men were either killed or escaped. The others, such as Xie nianqing and the old man from the flame Chamber of Commerce, rushed back. Their hearts sank. They knew that they were most likely doomed today.</p><p>damn it! Even if I die today, I won’t let you have a good time. Let’s die together!</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared with a murderous aura.</p><p>In the chaotic Astral Ocean, they were used to seeing life and death, and often walked on the edge of life and death. At this moment, their ferocity was aroused. With loud roars, the Qi on their bodies suddenly became violent.</p><p>“Let’s die together!”</p><p>The aura on the skinny man’s body also became violent.</p><p>“Not good, they’re going to self-destruct!”</p><p>The old man from the flame Chamber of Commerce exclaimed.</p><p>“Quickly retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>Chen Zhao and the others, who were watching the battle from all directions, shouted in horror.</p><p>The self-destruction of a peak-tier King was extremely terrifying, and everything within a hundred miles would be affected.</p><p>“You want to self-destruct? did I allow it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and his essential core exploded wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was extremely strong now. Once it exploded, the two fist forces immediately became incomparably terrifying. They instantly shattered the void and bombarded the knife-scarred man and the thin bamboo pole.</p><p>Before the two of them could self-destruct, they were directly torn to pieces by the terrifying power. They didn’t even have the time to let out a blood-curdling scream.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and he flashed past them. He devoured their blood essence and kept their storage rings.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s devouring of the blood essence was done very discreetly. The devouring power was used on his palm and the blood essence was absorbed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed past the corpses and he devoured all the blood essence.</p><p>There were nearly eight hundred people, and two to three hundred of them were martial Kings. This blood essence was too rich, how could he miss it?</p><p>Luo Xin, Chen Zhao, and the rest were dumbfounded. Two peak-tier Kings were killed by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>After a long while, a deafening cheer erupted.</p><p>Most of the people were cheering, especially the people from the flame Chamber of Commerce. They often visited the chaotic Astral Ocean and naturally knew of the blood Fiend Pirates “reputation. They had originally thought that they would be doomed this time. However, they didn’t expect that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were so unimaginably powerful. They were actually two young peak King Warriors who could easily crush their opponents.</p><p>Having escaped death, they naturally cheered, were happy, and excited.</p><p>“I’ve heard that many young geniuses have entered the chaotic Astral Ocean to train. Some of them are even peerless geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents. Could it be that these two are the geniuses on the list?”</p><p>I don’t know. I don’t know what his name is. In my opinion, even if he’s not on the list of top 1000 talents, he’s close to that level.</p><p>Waves of discussion could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>young master Lu, miss Xie, thank you for your help this time. Luo Xin is extremely grateful!</p><p>Luo Xin walked to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and bowed.</p><p>miss Luo Xin, you don’t have to be so polite. I’ll still say the same thing. If there’s a need for this Lu to take action, this Lu will definitely take action!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph, if we don’t make a move, someone is probably going to drive us away.”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted and glanced at Chen Zhao, who was standing not far away.</p><p>Of course, Chen Zhao also heard this.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s there to be proud of? Wasn’t he just a peak-tier King? It had taken him so long to kill two pirates, and their names weren’t on the list of top 1000 talents. What was he so proud of? If my big brother wasn’t over 30 years old, he would have been on the list of top 1000 talents!”</p><p>Chen Zhao gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.</p><p>“Alright, let’s rest!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode towards a stone house.</p><p>The others also began to clean up the battlefield.</p><p>He walked into the stone house, but there was no one there. It was obvious that the people on this Island had all been killed by the blood Fiend Pirates.</p><p>Lu Ming randomly found a stone house and started to refine the blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of two peak-tier Kings, more than ten late-tier Kings, and hundreds of martial artists of different levels were extremely rich. Lu Ming used all of them to improve his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn’t help the nine Dragon bloodline advance to the ninth level of the king class. In order to advance to the ninth level of the king class, the amount of blood essence required was enormous, and this amount was far from enough.</p><p>The night passed uneventfully. The next morning, when the four-winged Flying Tiger was almost done resting, everyone set off again for golden sand island.</p><p>Although they ran into some trouble on the way, even a small pirate group, this group didn’t even have a peak-tier King and was easily defeated.</p><p>Five days later, they finally arrived at golden sand island.</p><p>The Golden sand island is considered relatively large and famous among the many islands in the chaotic Astral Ocean. It has a circumference of several hundred thousand li and is like a continent.</p><p>There was a lot of golden sand on it, hence the name golden sand island.</p><p>In the sea area with a radius of tens of millions of miles, golden sand island was a large gathering place. There were many forces here, and at least tens of millions of Warriors had gathered here. It could be said that there were many masters.</p><p>There were even quite a few sea of soul realm experts, but they didn’t usually show their faces.</p><p>The four-winged Flying Tiger of the flame Chamber of Commerce landed on a vast Golden Beach.</p><p>young master Lu, miss Xie, this must be your first time on the Golden sand island, right? the flame Chamber of Commerce has a large stronghold on the Golden sand island. Why don’t we go there and have a look? I’ll be the host and show you around.</p><p>Luo Xin walked to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and smiled.</p><p>“Thank you, miss Luo Xin, but the two of us still have other things to do. We’ll chat again next time!”</p><p>Lu Ming declined.</p><p>“Oh, if that’s the case, next time then. But young master Lu, Lady Xie, the chaotic Astral Ocean is different from the outside world. Here, there is no law or order. If you make a move, there will be a massacre. You two must be careful!”</p><p>Luo Xin warned him kindly.</p><p>“Thank you, miss Luo. Goodbye!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing bade farewell and headed toward the Golden sand island.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
