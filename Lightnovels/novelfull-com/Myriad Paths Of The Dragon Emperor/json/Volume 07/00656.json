If you have the ability, accept the battle. Don’t ever surrender!”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s eyes flickered with resentment. He hated Lu Ming to the core. His face was still swollen. He hoped that Lu Ming would accept the challenge. If he did, he would definitely die at Xue gang’s hands.</p><p>Asura, that’s a very domineering name. I just don’t know if you have the guts. Xue gang sneered.</p><p>“Courage? What is courage?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“I’m afraid you’ll surrender before the battle!” Xue gang licked his lips.</p><p>hehe, Gang Xue, you don’t need to provoke me. You’ve come at the right time. I can use you to practice my fist techniques!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, so you’re not going to surrender? Haha, good!”</p><p>Xue gang was overjoyed.</p><p>“Blood flame palm!”</p><p>A blood-red palm print shot out from Xue gang’s hand. He could not wait to launch an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming now had all the assets of three peak-tier Kings. Including Lu Ming’s own, it would be the assets of four peak-tier Kings.</p><p>How much wealth would the four peak-tier Kings have? if Lu Ming surrendered without a fight, one million best-grade spirit crystals would be enough. Wouldn’t he suffer a huge loss?</p><p>At this moment, Xue gang’s heart was burning.</p><p>The blood-colored palm print shook the space and a bloody smell filled the air.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>The fist force collided with Xue gang’s palm print, but it was instantly destroyed by the bloody palm print.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw dozens of punches in a row.</p><p>However, Xue gang struck a few more times and completely destroyed Lu Ming’s fist radiance.</p><p>hehe, although your fist force is strong and fierce, you are still far from being able to fight me!</p><p>Xue gang sneered.</p><p>this Xue gang seems to be a new genius. His combat strength is not bad, and he’s not weaker than the sacred constellation from a few months ago!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was much stronger than he was a few months ago. If Lu Ming were to unleash his full power now, he could kill the sacred constellation from a few months ago in one move.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming would not do that. First of all, he had to practice his fist techniques and attract more powerful opponents.</p><p>“Then I’ll increase my true essence by another 20%!”</p><p>Circulating his essential core, Lu Ming threw another punch. A vacuum tunnel appeared and it collided with Xue gang’s sanguine flame palm.</p><p>The fist force and the blood flame palm both disappeared.</p><p>“You … He’s even hiding his strength?”</p><p>Xue gang’s expression changed. Lu Ming’s fist force could still be improved. He had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>The few people earlier were killed by Lu Ming in this way.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Xue gang roared as his Blood Meridian exploded. The bloody palm print became even more overbearing as the will of blood enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The bloodline martial technique was a heaven level upper class bloodline martial technique. It was extremely powerful. In terms of power, it was even more powerful than Lu Ming’s three absolutes of the Dragon God.</p><p>After all, the Dragon God’s three absolutes was a martial technique that Lu Ming cultivated from someone else. It could not be compared to bloodline martial arts techniques.</p><p>Xue gang used all his strength and his power was doubled. His attacks drowned Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>“It’s finally getting interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, raging flames started to burn around his body. It was the fire concept.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had only used one kind of fire concept. When the fire concept was integrated with the explosive star fist, it made the power of the explosive star fist even more terrifying. Each fist force was like a burning meteor, full of brutal aura.</p><p>The fist force and Xue gang’s blood-colored palm print collided with each other.</p><p>As for Gang Xue’s concept of blood, the energy that could drain blood was of no use to Lu Ming.</p><p>Could it be compared to the devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline?</p><p>As long as the nine Dragon bloodline was activated, the blood Concept would lose its effect.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had passed. Just like the previous battle, Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand again.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Many people widened their eyes.</p><p>Chen Zhao, in particular, was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Xue gang roared continuously as he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He was actually being suppressed. Could it be that he was going to end up like the previous few people and be killed by Lu Ming?</p><p>No, no, I can’t.</p><p>He’s a peerless heaven’s pride expert and has the chance to break into the list of top 1000 talents. This time, he came to the chaotic Astral Ocean to train himself and prepare for the upcoming battle of Kismet. How could he die?</p><p>However, no matter how hard he tried, he was still suppressed by Lu Ming. He could feel that Lu Ming’s fist force was getting stronger and stronger. Every time the fist force exploded, he felt a pain as if his skin was being torn apart.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>die! Xue gang roared and rushed into the sky, trying to escape.</p><p>“Can you leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air, his speed faster than Xue gang’S. He appeared in front of Xue gang in an instant and punched him.</p><p>Xue gang did not expect Lu Ming’s speed to be so terrifying. In a hurry, he managed to block with his palm, but the palm print was destroyed by Lu Ming. His body flew off the fighting ring like a cannonball and landed heavily on the fighting ring, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming chased after him.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I admit defeat. Asura, let me tell you, I’m a member of the heavenly corpse sect. If you kill me, the heavenly corpse sect will never let you off.”</p><p>Xue gang shouted.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>Didn’t the heavenly corpse sect toy with those refined corpses all day long? How come Xue gang didn’t have a refined corpse?</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was stunned, Xue gang thought that Lu Ming was afraid. He shouted again,”Asura, as long as you let me go, I can let bygones be bygones. What do you think?”</p><p>“Hehe, Xue gang, have you forgotten that this is the chaotic Astral Ocean? the heavenly corpse sect can’t control this place. Moreover, the people of the heavenly corpse sect deserve to die even more!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming said in a cold voice. Then, he dashed toward Xue gang.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xue gang roared and tried his best to resist, but the result was already determined.</p><p>After a few moves, he was bombarded by Lu Ming’s punches and his body exploded.</p><p>Xue gang was dead.</p><p>This genius of the sky corpse sect had defeated Chen Dao, who had won eight times in a row, and was killed by Asura.</p><p>The atmosphere at the scene was pushed to a climax, and everyone cheered excitedly.</p><p>kill, good kill! Haha, this is too exciting!</p><p>that’s right. It’s indeed exciting for a young genius to be killed!</p><p>“That idiot actually brought up the heavenly corpse sect. In the chaotic Astral Ocean, it doesn’t matter who comes!”</p><p>Asura is so powerful. He has won four times in a row. He even killed Xue gang. He sounds young. Is he another young genius? ”</p><p>“Very possible? Hell King is also a young genius, and he’s most likely a peerless genius on the list of top 1000 talents. This Asura is most likely a peerless genius as well!”</p><p>“Too many young geniuses have come to the chaotic Astral Ocean recently.”</p><p>The clamor, cheers, and discussions rose and fell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
