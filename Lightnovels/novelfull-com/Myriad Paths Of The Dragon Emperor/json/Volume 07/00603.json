It was the aura of a peak-tier King.</p><p>...</p><p>peak-tier King! The Holy star has broken through to peak-tier King!</p><p>“Heavens, the sacred constellation was already incomparably powerful to begin with. Now that it has broken through to peak-tier King, just how powerful is it?”</p><p>no wonder he’s a peerless heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents. He’s really terrifying. Right now, apart from the palace Master and a few sea of soul realm experts, no one in the Tianxuan region is his match.</p><p>Lu Ming is finished. He’s definitely no match for them!</p><p>There was an uproar in the audience. Many people had thought that Lu Ming could fight against the Holy Star City, but they had changed their minds.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the peak of Lv 9 martial King realm. Although he could defeat the divine glory, the divine Star and the divine glory were two completely different concepts.</p><p>The Holy star that had broken through to peak-tier King could probably kill the Holy Light with one move.</p><p>“Haha, let’s see how that kid is going to fight now.”</p><p>Mu Yi sneered.</p><p>Xingchen, make your move as soon as possible and cripple that little bastard. Don’t delay the auspicious day of the wedding!</p><p>Holy constellation’s mother called out.</p><p>he really did break through to peak-tier King tier? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Back in the great domain, Qin Qingshan’s ranking was one rank lower than that of the sacred constellation. Since Qin Qingshan had already broken through to peak-tier King, Lu Ming guessed that the sacred constellation had most likely broken through to peak-tier King as well.</p><p>It was indeed the case now.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you admit defeat now and destroy your cultivation, I can spare your life!”</p><p>The Holy star’s entire body was suffused with Starlight, like a god descending from the heavens, inspecting the world with great confidence.</p><p>“Haha, Holy star, you think you can beat me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air, his long hair flying in the wind. His eyes were like two unsheathed divine swords, revealing a sharp fighting spirit.</p><p>“I will let you understand the difference between you and me!”</p><p>Saint constellation’s eyes glowed with Starlight. At this moment, the Starlight on his body was boiling, like a raging flame.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>With a soft cry, a starry sword, hundreds of feet long, condensed and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck out a palm.</p><p>The heavenly path palm was a martial arts technique that was infinitely close to the heaven level. However, under the activation of Lu Ming’s current cultivation, it unleashed a terrifying and unparalleled power that seemed to exceed its original level.</p><p>A huge handprint with nine fingers appeared. The patterns on it were clear, like heavenly Dao inscriptions. It emitted a terrifying aura and smashed toward the starry sword.</p><p>An earth-shattering boom resounded in the sky, and a bright light appeared. Some of the weaker cultivators felt a sharp pain in their eyes, and they couldn’t help but close their eyes.</p><p>In the next moment, the light disappeared, and the palm and the giant sword disappeared at the same time.</p><p>Holy star, there’s no need to test me. Show me your true strength. Otherwise, you will end up like the Holy brilliance!</p><p>Unknowingly, a long spear had appeared in Lu Ming’s hands, and his fighting spirit soared.</p><p>“I’ll grant you your wish, star point Sword Art!”</p><p>The Starlight on the sacred constellation became even more resplendent. It was clearly daytime, but in the depths of the sky, there were rays of Starlight falling down and landing on the sacred constellation.</p><p>The star intent realm was indeed marvelous.</p><p>At the same time, a dazzling battle sword appeared in Saint Xingchen’s hand. As he waved the Battle Sword, stars suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>Then, stars fell toward Lu Ming one after another, turning into swords of stars. They were like streams of light, shooting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Hundreds of streams of light covered the area and completely locked onto Lu Ming’s retreat path. There was no way to avoid it.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood still and stabbed with his spear. Hundreds of three-colored true dragons flew out and roared as they charged at the stars.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Like fireworks exploding, the sky was filled with resplendent lights.</p><p>However, the crowd was not in the mood to watch. Their eyes were completely locked on Lu Ming and the Holy star.</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said softly as he strode forward. His long spear shone brightly as he thrust it forward. A huge three-colored true dragon roared and pounced at the sacred planet.</p><p>“Point star sword, ten thousand swords unite!”</p><p>Saint Starlight waved his hand, and it seemed as if there were tens of thousands of stars that entered Saint Starlight’s battle sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent boom was heard in the sky again. Many people felt their eardrums vibrating and their heads rumbling. In their shock, they hurriedly circulated their true essence to protect their eardrums.</p><p>In the sky, a bright light appeared and then disappeared!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two figures got closer and closer, and finally, they collided heavily.</p><p>The space trembled violently as if it could not bear the burden.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two figures turned into two streams of light and kept clashing in the air. A wanton force cut through the void and kept falling.</p><p>If it weren’t for the elders ‘true essence shield, the tables and chairs below would have all been destroyed.</p><p>But even so, the true Yuan barrier was still shaking, and the dozen peak-tier King elders ‘expressions changed.</p><p>Just the overflowing Qi was enough to make them feel tremendous pressure. If they really participated in the battle, wouldn’t they be easily killed?</p><p>Was this still the power of a King tier?</p><p>At the scene, countless eyes were staring at the sky without blinking. Their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight against the sacred constellation and fight it to this extent.</p><p>Today, regardless of whether Lu Ming won or lost, his name was bound to shake the Tianxuan region and leave a heavy mark in the history of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>“Damn it, Xingchen will definitely be able to kill this little bastard!”</p><p>The mother of Holy constellation growled in a low voice, and her eyes revealed a sinister look.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battle in the sky continued, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 50 moves had been exchanged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, a layer of blood-red light emanated from the sacred constellation. Then, Starlight spread out, and a scroll appeared above Shen Xingchen’s head.</p><p>The scroll was unfurled, and seven stars shone on it.</p><p>That was the seven stars of heavenly Dipper.</p><p>There were seven silver chakras on the scroll, and they were emitting rays of light.</p><p>This was the second bloodline of the Holy star, a seventh level King bloodline.</p><p>The sacred constellation’s bloodline erupted, and its aura became even stronger.</p><p>“You have the bloodline, but I don’t? Explode!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His second bloodline was unleashed.</p><p>He was also a seventh level King.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s two bloodlines had both advanced to the seventh level of the king level.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not unleash the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming decided that in the future, he would try his best not to use the nine Dragon bloodline in crowded places, especially in the Emperor sky divine Palace.</p><p>Although the nine suns Supreme had already helped him seal his aura, who knew if someone would guess something from his appearance? it was better to be careful.</p><p>The eruption of their bloodlines caused the battle between the two to become even more intense.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 50 moves had been exchanged!</p><p>“Look, Lu Ming is at a disadvantage!”</p><p>that’s right. He’s no match for Lu Ming and is being suppressed. The number of attacks from the sacred constellation is increasing, but Lu Ming’s attacks are decreasing.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming is going to lose.”</p><p>he’s only a peak Lv 9 martial King after all. It’s already a miracle that he’s been able to fight the Holy star until now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
