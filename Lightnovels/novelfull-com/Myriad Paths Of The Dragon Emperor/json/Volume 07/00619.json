The earth core flowing flame is a top-grade flame in the world. If you use it to light up your mind fire, it’ll be perfect. Kid, I’m starting to envy your luck.”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>if I absorb this flame, there won’t be any fire-attribute spiritual Qi here. Wouldn’t this cultivation Holy Land be ruined? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What waste? let me tell you, if you absorb this core flowing flame, the value of this place will truly burst out. Don’t tell me you haven’t realized that this place is actually a spiritual eye? It’s just that it has been absorbed by the core flowing flame in the past, and even blocked it. After you absorb this core flowing flame, the spiritual energy here will spread out, turning this place into a real cultivation Holy Land!”</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“It’s actually like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming observed carefully and realized that there was indeed a continuous flow of spiritual energy from below. Most of it was absorbed by the earth core flowing flame and was even burned by the hot flames. The remaining spiritual energy spread out with the hot flame aura, forming fire spiritual energy.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew how the earth cave was formed.</p><p>kid, this is no time to lose. Let me teach you how to light up your spiritual fire. First, visualize ten spiritual lamps in your sea of consciousness!</p><p>Dandan began to teach.</p><p>Lu Ming started to visualize the spirit lamp in his sea of consciousness according to dandan’s method.</p><p>The sea of consciousness and the dantian, in a sense, were infinitely large, like two universes.</p><p>Although the lightning cauldron occupied a part of it, Lu Ming could visualize the spirit lamp in the other part of his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Slowly, in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, there seemed to be ten lamps. However, all ten lamps were extinguished and did not light up.</p><p>“Now, catch the core flowing flame and use the [ God of underworld visualization ] to absorb it into your sea of consciousness.”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palms and two huge palms formed, grabbing the earth core flowing flame.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth core flowing flame shook violently as if it had a mind of its own and wanted to escape.</p><p>The three intents of wind, fire, and Thunder burst forth. Combined with his essential core, he grabbed the earth core flowing flame tightly and brought it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his essential core was burning. The temperature of the core flowing flame was too high.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm and that his three intents had reached the great circle of level one, he would not have been able to deal with the earth core flowing flame.</p><p>Even an ordinary late stage King would be burned to death.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He used his essential core and intent to temper the violent elements in the core flowing flame, making it more docile.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming began to cast the meditation of the underworld, absorbing the earth core flowing flame and lighting up his mental energy fire.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Wisps of earth core flowing flame flew into Lu Ming’s glabella and appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming felt as if he was in magma. The terrifying temperature and flames were burning his body, including his soul.</p><p>Hot, it was too hot.</p><p>kid, you must hold on at this time. The better the flame, the more dangerous it will be when you ignite the mental energy fire. However, the benefits will be unimaginable!</p><p>Dandan’s voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and tried his best to control the core flowing flame, starting to light up his mental energy fire.</p><p>“Give me some!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, controlling the core flowing flame to light up a lamp.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>All of the earth core flowing flame rushed towards the first lamp.</p><p>The first lamp emitted a fiery red light, followed by a wisp of flame on the wick. At first, the flame was very small, but slowly, the flame on the wick grew bigger and bigger, and finally, it burned fiercely.</p><p>It was a success. The spirit Fire had been successfully ignited.</p><p>However, this was only the beginning. It was far from the end.</p><p>When the first lamp’s flame burned to its limit, the second lamp’s wick also emitted a wisp of flame, and the flame grew from small to large.</p><p>“Kid, the core flowing flame is too strong. This is an opportunity to light up many spirit lamps in one go. You should grasp it well!”</p><p>Dandan reminded.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the meditation with all his might.</p><p>When the second lamp’s flame reached its limit, the third lamp’s wick also emitted flames. The flames were Scarlet.</p><p>Then, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth …</p><p>Lighting six lamps had already reached the requirements of a true Ming refiner, but it was still not the limit. It was far from enough.</p><p>The seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth lamps.</p><p>All ten spirit lamps were lit up.</p><p>“Haha, perfect, perfect, the first stage is perfect, it is indeed the core flowing flame!”</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>The ten spirit lamps burned with Scarlet Spirit Fire. They burned fiercely. When the ten flames burned to the extreme, suddenly, the spirit Fire of the ten lamps all gathered on the first lamp, and the other nine were all extinguished.</p><p>The flame of the first mind lamp began to change, turning into an orange flame.</p><p>Orange meant that Lu Ming had advanced to the second level.</p><p>The mental fire of a Rank 2 Alchemist was orange.</p><p>It was not over yet. When the orange flame on the first lamp reached its limit, the second lamp was also successfully ignited with an orange flame.</p><p>Just like before, the third lamp appeared, then the fourth …</p><p>Finally, the tenth.</p><p>The second level also lit ten lamps, perfect.</p><p>When the orange flames of the ten lamps reached their maximum, they gathered on the first lamp again, and the flame of the first lamp turned yellow again.</p><p>Yellow flame, level three Alchemist.</p><p>Just like before, after the first lamp was ignited, the second, third, and fourth lamps were ignited …</p><p>This time, he lit up six lamps in one go. At this point, he finally stopped and did not continue to light the seventh lamp.</p><p>“The energy of the core flowing flame has finally been exhausted. Hahaha, amazing. The first two stages of igniting the mind fire were perfect, and the third stage has ignited six mind lamps. This is already very rare.”</p><p>Dandan laughed out loud and danced with joy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a happy expression.</p><p>Within the same level, the more mind lamps one lit, the more vigorous the mind fire would be. This also represented that one’s mind power would be stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming was now a full-fledged third-level Alchemist. Of course, he had only achieved the level of mental fire. However, if he wanted to become a real third-level Alchemist, he still needed to practice inscriptions. He could only be considered a true Alchemist if he mastered inscriptions.</p><p>kid, let me tell you, the strength of your mental fire is not even comparable to the half-baked fifth-rank alchemists here. Hehe, the first two stages are perfect. Not many people can achieve perfection.</p><p>however, it’ll be difficult for you to reach perfection in your future cultivation. However, I still hope that you’ll try your best to reach perfection in every stage!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. If he wanted to cultivate, he had to work in the best direction. He would work hard.</p><p>He also knew that dandan was right. An ordinary Alchemist would only light three spirit lamps before advancing to the next level. Compared to such an Alchemist, his spirit power was indeed comparable to that of a fifth-rank Alchemist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
