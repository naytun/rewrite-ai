They flickered with a dazzling light.</p><p>Lu Ming was also excited. The nine keys had finally appeared. This meant that the Martial Emperor’s treasure was about to be opened.</p><p>“Let’s pour in our true Qi and see what changes there are!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. Together with Lu Ming, they poured their vital essence into the Jade sword.</p><p>The Jade sword trembled slightly. Then, a map appeared in the air.</p><p>“There’s a change!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The map started to change. Slowly, the dot enlarged. Lu Ming and the rest realized that the map of the chaotic Astral Ocean was getting bigger and bigger in front of their eyes.</p><p>On the map, there was still a point that pointed to a certain place.</p><p>As the map changes, all the other regions on the edge of the map have disappeared. Only the chaotic Astral Ocean is left on the entire map. That point points to a Sea region to the North of the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>Their eyes lit up. Apparently, that was where the treasures of Martial Emperor were.</p><p>“Everyone, everyone, can you hear me?”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the two Jade swords. The voice was rough and sounded like a middle-aged man’s.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were shocked.</p><p>Why was there a sound? could it be the artifact Spirit of the Jade sword, or the sound that was sealed inside when the Jade sword was being refined?</p><p>But at this moment, another voice was heard.</p><p>“Who are you?” From the voice, it seemed to be a young man.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at each other. It did not seem to be what they had thought.</p><p>everyone, you must have obtained the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure, right? I’m one of them!</p><p>The rough voice began to speak again.</p><p>“What a magical formation. It can actually transmit messages to each other. Hehe, it seems like the nine keys already have an owner.”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice was heard. It seemed to be an old man, ou Ming.</p><p>“That’s right, the nine Jade swords can communicate with each other. Where are you now? We already know about the location of the treasure, so we should head over to open it!”</p><p>The rough voice continued.</p><p>“Hehe, I’ve arrived in the chaotic Astral Ocean long ago.”</p><p>Old ou’s voice sounded.</p><p>“I’m also in the chaotic Astral Ocean!”</p><p>The young voice rang out.</p><p>“I’m also in the chaotic Astral Ocean!”</p><p>At this moment, another voice was heard. It was a new voice, very young.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Lu Ming’s expressions changed slightly when they heard the figure. They were familiar with the voice.</p><p>Jian feiliu, that’s right, it was Jian feiliu’s voice.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He activated his essential core and poured it into the sword.”The King of Hell?”</p><p>The voice from the Jade sword went silent. After a while, it said, ” “Shura?”</p><p>His voice was filled with surprise.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This time, he was sure that the other party was really Jian feiliu.</p><p>They didn’t call each other by their real names. The Martial Emperor’s treasure was a matter of great importance. They couldn’t reveal this information now.</p><p>“It seems that some of you know each other. What a coincidence. Is anyone still here? I’m also in the chaotic Astral Ocean, where are the others?”</p><p>A rough voice sounded.</p><p>After that, there was a moment of silence.</p><p>A moment later, another voice was heard.</p><p>“I’m in the chaotic Astral Ocean!”</p><p>“I’m here too!”</p><p>Two new voices rang out in succession.</p><p>In this way, a total of seven voices were heard.</p><p>Xie nianqing didn’t speak. Other than him, there was only one other person.</p><p>“Everyone, I … I estimate that there’s still half a month’s journey left. Everyone, why don’t you wait for me at the treasure trove first?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and melodious voice was heard.</p><p>It was a woman’s voice. She sounded very young and a little timid.</p><p>“Half a month? Alright, we’ll go over and wait for you!”</p><p>A rough voice sounded.</p><p>wait a minute. Let’s discuss this first. The Martial Emperor’s treasure is of great importance. No matter if it’s real or fake, we can’t reveal it. You guys didn’t leak it, did you? ”</p><p>Old ou’s voice sounded.</p><p>No. It’s about the Martial Emperor’s treasure. How could I tell anyone? ”</p><p>“I’m the only one!”</p><p>……</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>that’s good. Let’s meet at the location of the treasure!</p><p>Old ou’s voice was heard, and then there was no other sound.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing retracted their essential core and the map disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you think?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>we can’t trust these people completely. Who knows if they’ve brought other people with them? we can go to the treasure ground first, but we can’t show ourselves!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I think so too,” Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>Although he didn’t know whether it was true or not, it was still a serious matter concerning the Martial Emperor’s treasure. Therefore, he had better be careful.</p><p>“Let’s go. It’s a long journey from here to our destination.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and called dandan. The two of them rose into the air and flew in the direction indicated on the map.</p><p>After flying for half a month, they finally got close to the sea.</p><p>The two of them looked at the map and concealed their auras. They flew high in the sky and looked down.</p><p>“It should be that small island.”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed to a small island in front of him. That small island was the location indicated on the map.</p><p>There were nine huge stone pillars on the island. They were like mountain peaks, but not a blade of grass grew on them.</p><p>Moreover, the nine stone pillars were like nine combat swords, pointing straight up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, look! There’s someone there!”</p><p>Xie nianqing whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. Indeed, there was a figure sitting cross-legged on one of the sword-like stone pillars.</p><p>From a distance, he looked like a middle-aged man.</p><p>he’s alone. Let’s find an island nearby to settle down and act according to the situation!</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>They had to be careful. Other than Jian feiliu, no one else knew who the other Masters of the Martial Emperor’s treasure were. They didn’t know their cultivation or background.</p><p>If a high level spirit ocean or spirit embryo realm expert came and they appeared rashly, the other party would attack and kill them. Then if they went out rashly, wouldn’t that be courting death?</p><p>The two of them retreated and found a small island 10000 miles away. They landed on it.</p><p>They planned to cultivate while waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>During the half a month of travel, they did not neglect their cultivation. In their minds, they constantly comprehended various martial skills.</p><p>Lu Ming, in particular, was more familiar with the use of various inscriptions and inscription arrays.</p><p>Moreover, the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire was almost completely refined. Lu Ming had already lit ten green mental energy lamps.</p><p>Great circle of the fifth-level Alchemist. Every level was perfected. The amount of energy consumed was terrifying. The seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire could only help him up to this point. He was almost done refining. Lu Ming could only rely on himself if he wanted to break through to level six.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
