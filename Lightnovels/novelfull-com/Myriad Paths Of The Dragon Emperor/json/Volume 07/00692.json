Why isn’t it open yet?”</p><p>...</p><p>“I heard that there are a total of nine keys to open the door. The blood poison sect has eight of them. They’re short of one, and it’s in the hands of a young man. He hasn’t come yet!”</p><p>some people speculate that the news was released by that young man. He’s probably coming soon. Let’s wait a little longer!</p><p>Sounds of discussion could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>After much difficulty, they managed to squeeze to the front. Countless people surrounded the island in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group squeezed to the front and saw the blood poison sect’s people standing together with ashen faces. There were more than a dozen people around them, and each of them had an imposing aura and was extremely powerful. They were actually all experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Among them, there were even experts even stronger than the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Haha, everyone from the blood poison sect, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming squeezed to the front and laughed heartily.</p><p>Everyone from the blood poison sect looked over.</p><p>“Little bastard, you’ve finally appeared. You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill, kill that little bastard!”</p><p>When the blood poison sect disciples saw Lu Ming, their eyes burned with a raging fire. They glared at Lu Ming, their killing intent incomparably thick.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps back and squeezed into the crowd. He said,”What’s wrong? You want to fight? There are so many experts here, let’s see how you guys are going to kill them!”</p><p>Everyone from the blood poison sect roared in anger, but they could do nothing.</p><p>There were too many people here and they were all experts. Lu Ming was in the crowd. How could they attack? Once they made a move, they would implicate others and cause public anger, and they would be the ones to die.</p><p>They could only glare at Lu Ming, wishing they could skin him alive.</p><p>The Martial Emperor’s treasure was supposed to fall into the blood poison sect’s hands. They had been looking forward to the blood poison sect’s rapid rise, but what about now?</p><p>There were so many people, more than a dozen at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and even stronger experts. Now that they had opened the Martial Emperor’s treasure, they could at most drink a mouthful of the soup.</p><p>Whether he could drink this mouthful of soup or not was still a problem.</p><p>All of this was Lu Ming’s fault. It was all Lu Ming’s fault. How could they not hate him?</p><p>As for the fact that they were the ones who made the first move and wanted to monopolize the Martial Emperor’s treasure, they would never think about it. In their opinion, it was what they should do, and the others had to fulfill their wishes.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Could it be that the last key was in Lu Ming’s hands?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a Jade sword appeared in his hand. He flung the Jade sword at an elder in a green robe.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll give you this key!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>The green-robed elder’s aura was unfathomable and even stronger than the xue du sect master’s.</p><p>The green-robed old man extended his hand and caught the Jade sword. A smile appeared on his face as he said,”Not bad, little guy!”</p><p>Then, he looked at the blood poison sect and the others. take out your keys and open the Martial Emperor’s treasure together!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The sect master of the xue du sect roared in his heart. He was extremely unwilling, but so what? He had no choice but to take it out obediently and open the Martial Emperor’s treasure.</p><p>If they didn’t take it out, the only outcome would be death.</p><p>Eight Jade swords appeared in the hands of the blood poison sect disciples.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the nine Jade swords appeared together, the nine Jade swords started to move. They trembled slightly, and complicated patterns appeared on their surface.</p><p>“What a wonderful inscription, what a brilliant inscription formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Now, his Dao of inscription was already considered pretty good, so his vision was naturally different. He could tell at a glance that the inscription formation on the nine Jade swords was very profound and could even be said to be mysterious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just at this moment, the nine sword-like stone pillars on the island also started to shake. Inscriptions appeared on them and echoed with the nine Jade swords.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the nine Jade swords left everyone’s hands and flew towards the nine stone pillars. Each Jade sword corresponded to a stone pillar.</p><p>In a flash of light, the nine Jade swords flew into the nine stone pillars and disappeared. At this moment, the nine stone pillars glowed brightly and nine beams of light shot up into the sky like nine divine swords.</p><p>A terrifying scene appeared. The sky above the island was originally filled with people. At this time, when the nine sword lights rushed out, those people exploded and turned into powder. They didn’t even have the chance to scream.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Terrified screams rang out, and countless people frantically retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were not directly above the pillar of light. They had just avoided the disaster and were now retreating frantically.</p><p>It was too terrifying. At least ten thousand people had died just now, and there were even sea of soul realm experts among them. However, under that light pillar, they couldn’t resist at all.</p><p>Some people’s eyes lit up. it seems that it might really be a Martial Emperor’s treasure. Even if it’s not a Martial Emperor’s treasure, it’s still a big deal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine pillars of light converged into one in the air, and the power grew even stronger.</p><p>Boom boom boom</p><p>At this moment, the island started to shake violently. Then, everyone saw the island split into two.</p><p>Moreover, the two halves of the island were separated by dozens of miles.</p><p>In the middle of the island, a Whirlpool appeared. Endless sea water began to spin, turning into a hole. It was a huge sea Whirlpool, and no one knew where it led to.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The vortex spun and rumbled with astonishing power.</p><p>Could it be that the Martial Emperor’s treasure was under this vortex?</p><p>Everyone hesitated. No one dared to go down first.</p><p>After a long while, someone finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. A white-haired old man stepped out and said, ” “Since I don’t have much lifespan left, I might as well take a gamble!”</p><p>This elder was a peak-tier King, and his thousand years were up. If he couldn’t break through to the spirit ocean realm, he would die of old age. This Martial Emperor’s treasure was an opportunity for him.</p><p>At the spiritual ocean tier, one’s lifespan would be increased by another 1000 years, and they would have a lifespan of 2000 years.</p><p>He rushed into the vortex and went down with it, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It’s fine, there’s no problem. Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Then, another group of people rushed down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>This time, someone screamed as his body was torn apart and he died in the whirlpool.</p><p>But some people rushed in.</p><p>the person who died was a martial Grandmaster and a martial King realm martial artist. Don’t worry, a martial King realm martial artist can withstand the power of the vortex!</p><p>that’s right. A Martial Emperor’s treasure, a martial Grandmaster ant. You must be dreaming if you want to get your hands on it. Charge!</p><p>Immediately, more people rushed down. They were all martial artists above the martial King realm. As expected, they were fine and disappeared into the center of the vortex one by one.</p><p>More people flew down.</p><p>After a short moment, those sea of soul realm experts also couldn’t hold back anymore, and flew towards the vortex.</p><p>The people from the blood poison sect cast a cold glance at Lu Ming before they flew into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>As for the martial arts grandmasters, they were extremely unwilling, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>There were even some martial arts grandmasters who did not believe in heresy and rushed down, eventually dying tragically.</p><p>Soon, large groups of martial King and martial artists rushed into the vortex. There were roughly no less than 100000 people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
