What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>The two of them were speaking via voice transmission, so no one else could hear them.</p><p>I’ve asked around. Some of the important treasures of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy are hidden in an underground cave in the back mountain. However, the underground cave is full of inscription arrays. Only the inscription tokens refined by the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy can enter. There are only ten such tokens in the entire Cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, and all of them are with some important figures of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy!</p><p>most of the important people are in seclusion, so we can’t find them at all. But as far as I know, Yun Haitang has an inscription token. As long as we get the token, we can secretly enter the treasure land of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy and take the heavenly demon fruit. Of course, it’s also good to take some other treasures along the way!</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh?” Lu Ming nodded. He started to think about how to get the inscription token.</p><p>“Quiet down!”</p><p>Yun Haitang spoke. Her voice was so sweet that it could melt anyone’s heart. For men, this was definitely a killer weapon. As expected, many people’s eyes became even more heated.</p><p>The fire in Gu Huaxu’s eyes seemed to be able to burn Yun Haitang.</p><p>this time, you’ll have three months of study, and I’ll be in charge of it!</p><p>Yun Haitang said, ” of course, I also know that some of you are already very good at alchemy, possibly far better than Haitang. So, I don’t dare to say that I’m teaching you. In the future, we can exchange our alchemy experiences and improve together. This is the most important thing.</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled sweetly and spoke very politely.</p><p>miss Haitang, you’re too humble. Everyone in the Yunfeng region knows about your alchemy skills. I hope that you can communicate more with miss Haitang in the future.</p><p>“Miss Haitang, I am the descendant of the Liu family. I hope miss Haitang can give me some pointers!”</p><p>“Haitang, I am …”</p><p>Some young men with extraordinary backgrounds introduced themselves one after another, hoping to attract Yun Haitang’s attention.</p><p>But Yun Haitang only smiled and nodded, not saying much.</p><p>After a long while, Yun Haitang spoke again, ” alright, according to the rules, there will be an alchemy test. There is no other meaning. I just want to see everyone’s alchemy standards and what you are good at. In the future, it will be more effective to exchange ideas. Does anyone have any objections? ”</p><p>“No, of course I want this!”</p><p>Everyone shouted.</p><p>Some of them had even begun to rub their fists and get ready to perform well to attract Yun Haitang’s attention.</p><p>hehe, this trash wants to attract Haitang’s attention? he’s a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. In my opinion, no one in this group can compare to brother Gu in alchemy.</p><p>that’s right. In a moment, brother Gu will definitely amaze the world with a single brilliant feat and attract Haitang’s attention. In the future, even if brother Gu returns with a beauty, it is possible. We are really envious!</p><p>Beside Gu Huaxu, a few young men started to flatter him.</p><p>The Gu family was very influential in the Yunfeng region, so naturally, there were many people who wanted to flatter Gu Huaxu.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s face was filled with pride.</p><p>In his opinion, these people were all half-baked, while his Gu family was a professional Alchemist. In the Yunfeng region, their reputation was only a little less than the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. He had absolute confidence in his alchemy skills.</p><p>the test is simple. You just need to refine a cultivation pill and hand it over to me!</p><p>Yun Haitang introduced.</p><p>Then, the disciples of the cloud Sea alchemy institution presented an alchemy furnace to the public square. Everyone was given a spiritual medicine to make a Peiyuan pill.</p><p>Pill furnaces and spirit herbs were the same. Next, it was time to test his alchemy skills.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing casually walked to the front of two alchemy furnaces.</p><p>However, he realized that Gu Huaxu had also come to their side.</p><p>This guy was definitely doing this on purpose. He probably wanted to show off his skills to Xie nianqing and Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, let’s start now. The time is half an hour!</p><p>Yun Haitang announced after everyone had chosen their elixir furnaces.</p><p>As soon as Yun Haitang finished speaking, everyone focused their attention and began to refine.</p><p>In the square, wisps of mental energy fire appeared, and the heat began to rise.</p><p>I didn’t expect it to be to refine the essence cultivating pill. My luck is pretty good!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>The vitality pill was a very common pill. It was a level-two pill. Lu Ming happened to have the vitality pill among the pills he had.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to start refining. Instead, he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>He realized that everyone was concentrating on controlling their mental energy fire and refining pills.</p><p>“Eh? This girl is actually a fourth-rank Alchemist. I can’t tell!”</p><p>Lu Ming noticed the green flame in Xie nianqing’s hand. It flashed and disappeared.</p><p>The green mental fire represented a level-four Alchemist.</p><p>The cultivation of an inscriber was much more difficult and slower than that of martial arts. It was already impressive that he had become a fourth-rank inscriber at such a young age.</p><p>More importantly, Xie nianqing’s progress in martial arts was even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that there was also a green flame in Gu Huaxu’s hand. It flashed and disappeared.</p><p>He was also a fourth-rank Alchemist. No wonder he was so proud.</p><p>“Then, I’ll start too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a roll of his quintessential essence, the lid of the alchemy furnace opened. Lu Ming patted the furnace, and a wisp of yellow mental energy fire flashed and disappeared. It surged into the alchemy furnace and began to heat it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming began to refine the pill, Yun Haitang’s expression suddenly changed and she looked in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>what a strong and pure mental fire. Although he’s only a third-rank Alchemist, the fire seed he uses is no small matter. The number of mental lamps he has lit is no small matter, either. He has at least four or even five in each rank!</p><p>Yun Haitang’s mind whirred. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on Lu Ming’s side, and they were filled with wonder.</p><p>However, he did not think that Lu Ming could have lit more than six spirit lamps at each level. That was because he was already a true inscription blacksmith. It was too difficult to reach that level.</p><p>To become a true inscription refiner, it did not mean that one only needed to light six spirit lamps at a certain level. One had to light more than six spirit lamps at each level.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know that he had attracted Yun Haitang’s attention. He was focused on refining the pills.</p><p>After a while, the pill furnace was heated up. He used his true essence to roll it up and began to put in various spirit herbs.</p><p>The order in which the spirit herbs were put in was also very particular. The time and timing between each ingredient needed to be grasped precisely.</p><p>Lu Ming put in the spiritual herbs one by one. When he had put in all the spiritual herbs, he closed the lid of the furnace and continued to input the mental energy fire to start the refinement.</p><p>A moment later, a strong medicinal fragrance was emitted.</p><p>At this time, he could start to condense the pill.</p><p>This was the most important step. To congeal the pill, one needed to use inscriptions. The better the control of the inscriptions, the more exquisite the pill would be, the better the fusion of the two would be, and the better the effect would be.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
