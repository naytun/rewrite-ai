Lu Ming is the Emperor sky Divine Guard of the Tianxuan sub-Palace. Even if Lu Ming has done something wrong, he will be dealt with by the Tianxuan sub-Palace, and it is not brother Shangguan’s turn to do anything!</p><p>Mu Tian’s strength was also unyielding.</p><p>He had his own standards and bottom line.</p><p>Moreover, he was the palace Master of the profound sky sub-Palace. If he just watched as Lu Ming was killed by Shangguan wuchen, how would the other Ditian divine guards view him?</p><p>How much of his prestige could he still retain? In the future, how many people would be convinced by him?</p><p>“Mu Tian, are you really going to stop me?”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen’s face darkened.</p><p>However, mu Tian had no intention of stopping.</p><p>The MU family was able to rise rapidly in the Tianxuan region, and it wasn’t as if they didn’t have any background. The MU family also had some background, but he didn’t want to use it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>“Brother mu, if you want to find an opponent, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>At this moment, Sheng Cang stood up and an aura that was as deep as the ocean Burst out from his body.</p><p>The aura enveloped mu Tian.</p><p>Mu Tian’s expression changed.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen sneered and continued to walk toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Mu Tian’s expression was a little gloomy. However, the divine Azure was not any weaker than him. With the divine Azure holding him back, it was difficult for him to save them.</p><p>you’re just a lowly, lowly, ant-like thing. You want to be on the same level as a true dragon? even if you have such thoughts, you’ll be sentenced to death!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen looked down at Lu Ming from above, his eyes full of disdain.</p><p>It was obvious that he was comparing the sacred constellation to a true dragon and Lu Ming to an ant.</p><p>The reason was that the blood of the Shangguan clan flowed through the Holy star.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With that, Shangguan wuchen slapped Lu Ming.</p><p>A palm print exuded a terrifying aura and pressed down on Lu Ming. The pressure was like a vast ocean pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming exploded with all his strength, even his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>His essence, Qi, and spirit were highly concentrated, forming a dazzling spear.</p><p>This shot was Lu Ming’s ultimate attack. It was his strongest attack at the moment.</p><p>Everyone only saw a spear radiance soaring into the sky and colliding with a palm print as vast as the sea. Then, endless light flashed.</p><p>Countless pairs of eyes were wide open, staring at the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming was going to take the attack of a sea of soul realm expert head-on? Would he be smacked to death in one palm?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a shocking boom, the dazzling spear radiance was shattered. A figure fell to the ground like a meteor.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the ground. First, he slid backward for a few hundred meters, then he took a few dozen steps back. With every step he took, the ground let out a violent roar, as if a mountain was crashing down.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that the ground of Tianxuan city was extremely hard and covered with inscriptions, there would have been dozens of holes in it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>After a few dozen steps, Lu Ming supported himself with the long spear and spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>His arm trembled non-stop and he could no longer feel anything. His body was in so much pain that it felt like it was about to split apart. A layer of blood seeped out of the surface of his skin.</p><p>“Is this the power of the spiritual ocean tier? It’s indeed terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>His most powerful attack could easily kill normal peak-tier Kings, but he was still heavily injured after taking a sea of soul realm attack.</p><p>This was even with the protection of the nine Dragon bloodline, which had devoured a part of the attack power.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t even know how much of his strength he had used.</p><p>“He didn’t die?”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen’s eyes turned cold. Lu Ming’s vitality had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can take!”</p><p>The killing intent emanating from Shangguan Wu Chen’s body became even colder.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan shouted worriedly and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Shangguan Wu Chen waved his hand, and a terrifying pressure fell on Mu Lan, making it difficult for her to move.</p><p>On the other side, mu Zheng and mu Xiu Yuan were also extremely worried. They wanted to help, but facing a spiritual ocean tier expert, they were completely powerless.</p><p>“I can only take a gamble with the lightning cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glinted with determination and he began to communicate with the lightning cauldron.</p><p>To be honest, today’s matter was somewhat out of his expectations.</p><p>Before this, he had no idea that sacred constellation actually had such a strong backing and background. He didn’t expect that besides Sheng Cang and mu Tian, there were also spiritual ocean tier elites.</p><p>He also didn’t expect that the other party would be so strong that he wanted to kill him in front of so many people.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming had already known, he would still do so and would not back down.</p><p>There were some things that could not be cowered. Cowering was not in his character, nor was it in his path of martial arts.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Shangguan wuchen uttered the word coldly. A terrifying palm print appeared again and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm print had yet to reach Lu Ming, but a terrifying pressure had already locked onto him. This palm was much more terrifying than the previous one.</p><p>Unable to avoid it, he could only take it head-on.</p><p>“Come, even if I die, I’ll make you shed a layer of skin!”</p><p>The ruthlessness in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified.</p><p>Although the lightning cauldron was powerful, Lu Ming was not confident that he could kill Shangguan Wu Chen in one blow. However, he could at least severely injure him.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to take out the lightning cauldron and fight to the death, a ray of rainbow light suddenly shot out from his body.</p><p>The rainbow light condensed into a blurry figure in the sky. The figure slapped out, and the world shook. The palm print that Shangguan Wu Chen had struck down was directly slapped away without a trace.</p><p>“That is … Senior Yan?”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally stopped controlling the lightning cauldron and looked at the blurry figure above his head.</p><p>Although it was blurry, Lu Ming could recognize it at a glance. It was Yan kuangtu.</p><p>At this moment, everyone at the scene was stunned. They looked at the blurry figure above Lu Ming’s head in a daze.</p><p>Just now, they had thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. However, a figure suddenly rushed out of his body. It was unbelievably powerful. With a slap, it directly destroyed Shangguan Wu Chen’s palm print.</p><p>Many people could not react in time.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Mu Tian and Sheng Cang could not help but widen their eyes in shock.</p><p>Shangguan wuchen’s eyes lit up and he said coldly, ” “Little bastard, it turns out that there’s a powerful man behind you. No wonder you’re so arrogant. But let me tell you, no matter who the Shangguan family wants to kill, no one will be able to save you! Kill!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen suddenly shouted. A sword appeared in his hand, and the sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>This combat sword was definitely a spirit weapon of the sixth level. It was extremely powerful. It expanded rapidly in the air and became a thousand feet long, slashing down at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this sword was terrifying. The space trembled like water, creating ripples.</p><p>However, the figure above Lu Ming’s head slapped him again.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The slap hit the combat sword and made a sound like metal hitting metal. Everyone was dumbfounded to see Shangguan Wu Chen’s combat sword flying away from the slap.</p><p>This scene was too terrifying.</p><p>It was just a blurry figure, and one could tell at a glance that it was not a real body. However, it was so terrifying that it had sent Shangguan Wu Chen’s sword flying with its bare hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
