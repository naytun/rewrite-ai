What’s the big deal about defeating that brat? In the future, your cultivation will continue to soar, and it will be easy for you to enter the list of top 1000 talents. At that time, Yun Haitang will throw herself into your arms, and you can have as many beautiful women as you want!”</p><p>...</p><p>The shriveled voice came out and painted a beautiful future for Gu Huaxu.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Alright, senior, I’ll listen to you.”</p><p>Gu Huaxu gritted his teeth and a wine jar sized Jade bottle appeared in his hand. The Jade bottle contained a dark green liquid that gave off a nauseating smell.</p><p>Gu Huaxu frowned.</p><p>boy, this strange medicine is my life’s work. Although it stinks, it’s only temporary. A great future awaits you in the future. Drink it quickly!</p><p>The shriveled voice said.</p><p>“Alright!” Gu Huaxu gritted his teeth, picked up the Jade bottle, and gulped down the entire bottle of dark green liquid!</p><p>“Good, good, hahaha!”</p><p>The voice laughed excitedly.</p><p>After a while, dark green lines appeared on Gu Huaxu’s abdomen. They covered his entire body and started to gather towards his head.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why do I feel like I can’t use my Zhen Yuan, I can’t even use my intent, and I can’t even move my body, what’s going on?”</p><p>Gu Huaxu called out in panic.</p><p>hahaha, the heavens are on my side, the heavens are on my side! I can finally be resurrected!</p><p>The shriveled voice let out a maniacal laugh.</p><p>Then, a shadow flew out from Gu Huaxu’s body. It looked like an old man, and his eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Gu Huaxu finally felt that something was wrong.</p><p>“What do you want? Of course, I’m going to use your body to come back to the world. All my efforts were not in vain, haha!”</p><p>The old man laughed wildly before turning into a ray of light and entering Gu Huaxu’s forehead.</p><p>“What are you doing? Get out!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” arghh! Gu Huaxu hollered. His face was extremely vicious and he was struggling like he was fighting with something.</p><p>However, half an hour later, Gu Huaxu’s voice became softer and the light in his eyes dimmed. He closed his eyes, but in the next moment, his eyes suddenly opened, revealing a look of excitement and joy.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve finally seized this body and returned to the world. Good, good, very good. Moreover, I’ve made it in time for the battle of Kismet, and this body just so happens to meet the requirements. This time, I’m going to seize a great opportunity!</p><p>Gu Huaxu laughed. To be exact, he was no longer Gu Huaxu.</p><p>Gu Huaxu, I’ll use your identity for now. However, your cultivation is too weak and needs to be improved first. Also, there seems to be some good things in the cloud Sea alchemy institution. You must get them!</p><p>&Nbsp; Gu Huaxu grinned and then sat down to cultivate.</p><p>As he cultivated, the spiritual Qi in the world started to gather in Gu Huaxu’s body. His aura also started to increase.</p><p>……</p><p>Cloud Sea alchemy institution.</p><p>As expected, from the second day onwards, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing felt that the atmosphere in the cloud Sea alchemy institution had changed. It had become a little heavy.</p><p>Moreover, there was no one to give lessons to them. Lu Ming and the rest suddenly became idle.</p><p>Yun Haitang had also disappeared. She had not shown her face and did not come to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that something must have happened to Yun congsheng, which had alerted the higher-ups of the cloud Sea alchemy institution.</p><p>Many of the things that the cloud Sea alchemy institution had done couldn’t be exposed. They were afraid of attracting the attention of the major forces.</p><p>He believed that during this period of time, they would not dare to go out and collect the innate blood Qi.</p><p>Since he was fine, Lu Ming simply stayed in the dormitory and cultivated in peace.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the Supreme shrine. There were some strange metals placed beside him. They were all refining materials.</p><p>With a roll of his essential core, a piece of dark golden metal appeared in front of Lu Ming. He stretched out his hand and pointed. A yellow flame flew out, wrapped around the dark golden metal, and began to burn.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mental energy fire used the geocentric flowing flame as its kindling. Its temperature was terrifyingly high. In a short while, the dark golden metal had completely turned into a pool of liquid. It rolled in the air and sizzled in the flame. One could see wisps of black flames floating upwards.</p><p>These were the impurities in the metal that had been burned. After a moment, Lu Ming added another piece of metal and continued to condense it with his mental energy fire.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming added six types of metals in a row. The six types of metals turned into liquid and fused together.</p><p>Slowly, the liquid metal turned into a long sword with strange patterns on it. The blade was extremely sharp.</p><p>However, it was only a semi-finished product. When the long sword was formed, Lu Ming began to inscribe rapidly in the air with his fingers. Lines of inscriptions flew into the sword and disappeared.</p><p>The aura on the sword grew stronger and stronger, giving off a sharp feeling.</p><p>The speed at which Lu Ming’s fingers inscribed the runes was getting faster and faster. It was so fast that only a bunch of shadows were left.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and stopped inscribing. He also kept his mental energy fire.</p><p>The long sword landed in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the long sword and waved it a few times. There was a sharp sound of the sword cutting through the air.</p><p>“A third level upper spiritual weapon!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up into a smile as he felt the inscription power from the inscription law.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first time forging a weapon, and he had already forged an upper third level spiritual weapon. Lu Ming was already quite satisfied.</p><p>This was related to Lu Ming’s previous two levels, where he had lit up ten mental lamps in the state of perfection.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming was familiar with it for a period of time, it would not be too difficult for him to refine third-level exquisite or peerless spiritual weapons. He could even refine fourth-level spiritual weapons.</p><p>In the following period of time, other than taking some time out every day to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth and the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, Lu Ming spent most of his time cultivating the underworld God meditation, refining pills, and refining weapons.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming felt that he was more talented in refining.</p><p>Under dandan’s guidance, Lu Ming managed to forge a superior third level spiritual weapon three days later. Seven days later, he managed to forge a peerless third level spiritual weapon.</p><p>Twelve days later, Lu Ming successfully refined a lower fourth level spiritual weapon.</p><p>If one refined a high-quality spirit weapon or a spirit weapon that was beyond one’s level, the power of inscription from the law of inscription would increase greatly. It was much faster than cultivating the underworld God visualization.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was improving very quickly.</p><p>In just half a month, Lu Ming had successfully lit up the eighth spirit lamp and was close to the ninth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was ten mind lamps.</p><p>It was only possible for him to possess the underworld God visualization and be able to Forge Spirit weapons above his level. If it was anyone else, they wouldn’t even be able to think about it.</p><p>The atmosphere in the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy had been very strange for the past half a month. However, as time passed, it slowly returned to its previous state.</p><p>On the 16th day, an elder finally came out to give a lecture.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, miss Haitang would like to invite you to Begonia courtyard for a chat!”</p><p>At this moment, a young maidservant came to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
