Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. He took a step forward and thrust his spear at the flood Dragon’s vital point.</p><p>don’t even think about it. Now, you can all die!</p><p>A purple figure emerged from the dragon’s head. This figure was formed by mental energy fire.</p><p>The purple mental fire represented a level-seven Alchemist.</p><p>It was an old man, but his face was extremely gloomy. He waved his hand and runes flew out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, inscriptions began to flash in the hall, giving off a bright light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A combat sword flew out and slashed at Lu Ming’s long spear. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he quickly retreated.</p><p>In the hall, countless runes glowed and enveloped Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist had long since set up an inscription formation in the hall. It seemed like he had been prepared to kill anyone who entered the hall eight hundred years ago.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist shouted coldly. He waved his hands and countless inscriptions flew out. The inscriptions in the hall glowed more and more. The black inscriptions wriggled like little snakes.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing cast the sky demon force field to cover himself and Lu Ming. He used the energy of the sky demon force field to resist the inscription array around them.</p><p>Sure enough, under the influence of the sky demon power field, the runes slowed down.</p><p>“Let’s retreat!”</p><p>Since he couldn’t kill them, he could only retreat.</p><p>“You want to leave? this old man says that no one can leave today!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist sneered. He waved his hands and the inscriptions around him became even more terrifying. They formed swords and slashed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>These arrays had been around for 800 years, but their power was still not terrifying.</p><p>Although the two of them tried their best to resist, they were still completely suppressed. They were in extreme danger.</p><p>“Damn it, you really think I’m just a decoration, watch me!”</p><p>Dandan opened its mouth and spat out three Jade tokens. It kept one for itself while the other two flew toward Xie nianqing and Lu Ming.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the form-shifting shadow-changing talisman can shift forms and shadows in any place, even in this inscription formation. I’ve spent a lot of time to refine this talisman. Quickly crush it and kill that flood Dragon!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>In this situation, he could only trust dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing took the Jade talismans and crushed them. Instantly, a light screen enveloped them.</p><p>Dandan also crushed a piece, and a light screen also enveloped him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Dandan’s figure darted out like a Phantom, and those inscriptions had no effect on it.</p><p>“How wonderful!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and he dashed out as well. As expected, when he walked past, he was like a Phantom. The runes passed through his body and did not have any effect.</p><p>“The form-shifting shadow-changing talisman, how do you have it? This ancient talisman has been lost for countless years. How do you have it?”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist called out in disbelief.</p><p>“Haha, Who am I? During this time, I’ve been desperately refining a few. I originally wanted to save them for a few dangerous places, but I didn’t expect to use them now. It’s an honor for you to see this King’s form shifting shadow changing talisman.”</p><p>Dandan laughed loudly, extremely proud.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath. He thrust his spear at the flood Dragon.</p><p>The flood Dragon did not resist at all. It pointed its chest at Lu Ming and allowed him to kill it.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist roared repeatedly as he tried his best to control the flood Dragon’s body to attack.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The flood Dragon clearly hadn’t been completely taken over by the seven-colored Daoist yet, and it was also doing its best to control its body.</p><p>A force field enveloped the Dragon. Xie nianqing walked over and used the sky demon force field to help imprison the Dragon.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced into the flood dragon’s chest.</p><p>Here, the flood Dragon’s scales had already been grabbed off by itself, and its defense was greatly reduced. The extremely sharp spear radiance pierced through the flood Dragon’s muscles and heart like a piece of rotten wood.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist roared.</p><p>“Hahaha, old freak, you want to take over my body? dream on!”</p><p>The flood Dragon laughed crazily.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and a violent vital essence surged into it, blasting the flood dragon’s heart into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At the same time, more than ten combat swords formed by the inscription formation slashed at Lu Ming. Lu Ming pulled out his long spear and retreated.</p><p>With a bang, the flood Dragon’s body fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>haha, old monster, your 800-year-old plan has finally failed!</p><p>The flood Dragon laughed carefreely. Slowly, his voice became softer and his life force slowly dissipated.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, all of you will die today!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist let out a crazed roar.</p><p>Before he died, he used a ball of true dragon blood to set up a trap and leave clues outside. He wanted to attract a flood Dragon and then occupy its body. With the true dragon’s blood as a medium, he was confident that he could succeed.</p><p>The lifespan of demonic beasts was far longer than that of humans, especially for existences like flood Dragons. With a long lifespan, the seven-colored Daoist would be able to explore even stronger realms.</p><p>Unfortunately, now that the flood Dragon was dead, it would be useless even if he took it.</p><p>“Refine, refine, refine!”</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>A layer of purple flames suddenly spread out from the flood Dragon’s body. The purple flames wrapped around the flood Dragon and burned wildly.</p><p>The flood Dragon’s body shriveled up as the flames burned, and the purple flames grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the end, the purple flames gathered in the air and formed a human figure. It was the seven-colored Daoist.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>For some reason, Lu Ming suddenly had a bad feeling. He pulled Xie nianqing and quickly retreated out of the hall.</p><p>“You want to leave? without the flood Dragon, brat, your body is not bad, let me use it!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist grinned hideously. The purple flames turned into a stream of light and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was fast, too fast. He crossed the hall in an instant. He was several times faster than Lu Ming and the rest. He was really like a ray of light.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had just retreated to the entrance of the hall when the purple flame caught up to them. It shot directly between Lu Ming’s brows and disappeared.</p><p>this is bad. He’s trying to take over Lu Ming’s body and destroy his soul!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression changed and his eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>it’s over, it’s over. Little beauty, Lu Ming is finished. Your little lover is finished!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“What do we do? What to do? Was there any way to save him? Dandan, aren’t you an expert? Quickly think of something!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was extremely anxious, like an ant on a hot pan. His eyes were misty and he almost shed tears.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella was covered with a layer of purple light. He sat cross-legged and seemed to be resisting with all his might.</p><p>“I do have an idea, but I don’t know if you’re willing to do it.”</p><p>Dandan touched her chin with one of her front claws.</p><p>“What method? Hurry up and tell me, I’ll definitely agree.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said anxiously.</p><p>“Is that so? alright, I know of a way. I want you and Lu Ming to cultivate the dual cultivation technique and have sex. This way, your soul can be transferred to Lu Ming’s side and help him fight against the seven-colored Daoist. This way, your chances of winning will be much higher.”</p><p>Dandan said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
