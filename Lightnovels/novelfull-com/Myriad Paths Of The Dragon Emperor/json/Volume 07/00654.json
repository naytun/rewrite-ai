If Lu Ming really wanted to kill him, the two of them would be finished.</p><p>Luo Xin did not say anything either. She also felt that Chen Zhao had gone too far. He had been targeting Lu Ming all this while. Lu Ming was already considered to have a good temper by not killing him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and turned to leave.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had disappeared from the grandstand, Chen Zhao’s eyes were filled with resentment. He growled, ” “Little b * stard, when my big brother’s injuries are healed, I’ll pay you back ten times what you did today!”</p><p>Luo Xin secretly shook her head. This kind of trash still wants to pursue her?</p><p>If it wasn’t for Chen Dao’s sake, Luo Xin wouldn’t even bother with him.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked out and strolled along the streets.</p><p>“I thought you were going to fight Xue gang.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Do you think I’ll be goaded into action by that idiot? How was that possible? This is a good place. If I go down and defeat Xue gang, many people won’t dare to go up.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Oh? What are your plans?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>one by one, of course. I can practice my fist technique and earn spiritual crystals at the same time. It’s killing two birds with one stone!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His eyes lit up and he walked into a mask shop.</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled and followed him in.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bought an Asura mask while Xie nianqing bought a Yaksha mask.</p><p>After buying the masks, the two of them bought a set of black robes and put them on. Then, they walked to the fated battle platform and paid 200 Supreme spiritual crystals each.</p><p>Lu Ming put on the Asura mask, while Xie nianqing wore the Yaksha mask.</p><p>Xue gang had already left the fighting ring, so no one would want to challenge him.</p><p>“Who’s going first?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Xie nianqing in a low voice.</p><p>“Anything is fine!”</p><p>“Then I’ll go first!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming moved and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>another person is going up the stage. What cultivation base is he at this time? ”</p><p>Seeing someone go up the stage, the audience’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>They had spent 200 Supreme spiritual crystals to watch the battle. If no one fought, then the spiritual crystals would have been wasted.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura spread out, telling everyone that he was a peak-tier King.</p><p>another peak-tier King has stepped onto the stage. What’s wrong with this person? blood has just dropped, and he’s already coming up. Isn’t he afraid that blood will come back and challenge him? ”</p><p>“I don’t think so. Xue gang will at least wait for the opponent to fight once or twice before he makes a move. If he’s too weak, I don’t think he’ll make a move.”</p><p>that Xue gang is definitely a rising genius. He’s too strong. If the list of top 1000 talents is rearranged, he might be able to make it.</p><p>Sounds of discussion could be heard in the surroundings.</p><p>“Who’s going to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and said loudly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming’s voice was heard, Chen Zhao and Luo Xin’s expressions changed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not change his voice. They could tell that it was Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>that brat is finally going on stage. Hehe, wear a mask and play tricks. Let’s see how many rounds he can win. Don’t die in the first round!</p><p>Chen Zhao sneered.</p><p>Luo Xin frowned and ignored Chen Zhao. Instead, she looked at the figure on the fighting ring curiously.</p><p>She did not know why but she felt that Lu Ming was not simple. Perhaps, Lu Ming could give everyone a surprise?</p><p>Luo Xin couldn’t help but look forward to it.</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>An old man with large eyes stepped into the air and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>kid, don’t think that you can scare people just because you’re wearing the Asura mask and imitating the King of Hell. The battle platform still depends on one’s true battle strength. Your storage ring is mine!</p><p>The large-eyed old man laughed savagely.</p><p>“I hope you can withstand a few more moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?” The large-eyed old man was slightly taken aback.</p><p>“I told you to stop talking nonsense and take this!”</p><p>I’m going to kill you, ” Lu Ming said softly. A violent fist force was blasted toward the large-eyed elder.</p><p>“Let’s see what you can do!”</p><p>A battleaxe appeared in the large-eyed elder’s hand and he swung it down, splitting Lu Ming’s fist force in half. However, before he could rejoice, the next fist force came attacking him. He could only swing the axe down again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s left and right fists were at full strength. Fist radiance burst out continuously like meteors streaking across the void.</p><p>The large-eyed elder’s combat strength was not bad. He was stronger than the peak-tier King of the blood Fiend Pirates. However, he was still completely suppressed by Lu Ming. This was the result of Lu Ming suppressing his essential core.</p><p>Lu Ming was using him to practice his martial arts.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming could still condense a figure that looked exactly like him in the Supreme shrine to practice martial arts techniques as long as he had spirit crystals.</p><p>However, as his cultivation level rose to the martial King realm, that function became useless.</p><p>It was just an inscription formation set up by the nine suns Supreme after he was severely injured. Its power was limited. However, after Lu Ming reached the martial King realm, the energy in his body was too great, and his attack power was even more terrifying. The formation could not be replicated at all.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had to find his own opponents to cultivate his martial arts techniques.</p><p>The large-eyed old man was suppressed by Lu Ming’s fist force. He roared in anger. No matter how strong his cultivation was or what powerful martial arts technique he used, he was still suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The large-eyed old man was finally scared and shouted that he admitted defeat.</p><p>“I won’t allow it!”</p><p>A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>“Not allowed? Don’t think that you can kill me!”</p><p>The big-eyed old man roared in anger and flew up into the sky. He actually tried to escape like Chen Dao.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core had increased and his fist force was more violent. He threw a punch and the air in front of the fist force was completely sucked dry, forming a vacuum tunnel. The violent fist force collided with the battle axe of the large-eyed elder and exploded.</p><p>The large-eyed old man spat out blood as he roared. His body fell and Lu Ming’s follow-up fist force bombarded him again.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few consecutive punches, the large-eyed elder screamed as his body exploded and he died on the spot.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and devoured the large-eyed old man’s blood essence, then he kept his storage ring.</p><p>“We won!”</p><p>In the stands, Luo Xin revealed a trace of excitement.</p><p>Hmph, he only won one round. That big-eyed old man’s battle strength isn’t high either. He’s far from my big brother!</p><p>Chen Zhao pouted.</p><p>“You can shut up!”</p><p>On the side, Chen Dao coldly glanced at Chen Zhao and scolded him. Now that his injuries had stabilized.</p><p>Chen Zhao’s expression changed, and he immediately shut up, not daring to say anything more.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard from the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
