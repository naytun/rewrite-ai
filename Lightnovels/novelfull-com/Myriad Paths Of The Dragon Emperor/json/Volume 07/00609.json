Her body flew far away, and one side of her face was swollen.</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling cried out hysterically. Her hair was disheveled, like a fierce ghost.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Shangguan Wu Ling. His eyes turned cold, and a terrifying killing intent burst out.</p><p>This killing intent was terrifying to an inconceivable extent. Once the killing intent was released, everyone felt as if they had come to the hell of Asura. There were mountains of corpses and seas of blood everywhere. Ghosts were wailing and wolves were howling.</p><p>Cold, cold to the bones, cold to the depths of the soul.</p><p>Everyone’s face turned pale.</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling, who was in the center of the killing intent, was suddenly stunned. Then, an expression of extreme fear appeared on her face, and her entire body began to tremble violently.</p><p>you wicked woman. Killing you will only dirty my hands!</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s indifferent voice came out of his mouth. He then looked up at the sky and said, ” I won’t interfere in a battle between young people, but if you elders want to bully the weak, then I don’t mind bullying the strong!</p><p>The strong bullied the weak!</p><p>Overbearing and arrogant!</p><p>If someone else had said this, they would have looked down on them. But since it was Yan kuangtu who said this, it was absolutely reasonable.</p><p>This was strength, and Yan kuangtu had this strength.</p><p>today, it’s a fair fight. Lu Ming is the winner. So, the Sheng family can get lost!</p><p>The last ‘get lost’ was like a thunderclap, the sky rumbled, and everyone’s eardrums hurt.</p><p>Although Sheng Cang, Shangguan Wu Chen and the others were unwilling, they did not dare to say a word. They hurriedly brought the dumbfounded Shangguan Wu Ling, the seriously injured Sheng Chen and the others, and retreated.</p><p>In an instant, not a single person from the Sheng family remained.</p><p>“Senior Yan, thank you for saving me!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward and cupped his fists sincerely to express his gratitude.</p><p>haha, you don’t have to be so polite with me. Also, don’t call me senior one after another. I’m only a hundred years old. I’m not that old. Call me big brother!</p><p>Yan Kuang tu laughed.</p><p>“Big brother Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He and Yan kuangtu were of the same generation.</p><p>Yan kuangtu waved his hand and the blurry figure above Lu Ming’s head disappeared. He looked at Lu Ming and then at Mu Lan.</p><p>“Haha, good boy. I was still wondering why you were in such a hurry. So you’re here to snatch a beauty. Good, this is what a man should do.”</p><p>Yan kuangtu patted Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“Mu Lan greets senior Yan!”</p><p>Mu Lan walked up to Yan kuangtu and bowed.</p><p>Yan kuangtu sized Mu Lan up and laughed, ” boy, you have good eyes. This girl is worthy of you. How about this, it’s better to have the wedding today than today. I’ll also have a cup of wine to drink!</p><p>that’s right. Today, LAN ‘er and the sacred constellation were supposed to get married, but you snatched it away halfway. I’ll leave LAN’ er to you from now on!</p><p>Mu Tian also walked over.</p><p>“Father, senior Yan!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Mu Lan shouted. A blush flashed across her beautiful face. She was so beautiful that nothing could compare.</p><p>“Marry … Marry Senior Sister Mu Lan?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>The reason why he had challenged sacred constellation was because Mu Lan had said that she didn’t want to marry sacred constellation. He had only wanted to help Mu Lan and had never thought of marrying her.</p><p>Indeed, although Mu Lan was extremely beautiful, he had never thought about it.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Lu Ming, you don’t want to marry her?”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s expression, mu Tian’s face darkened.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied.</p><p>At this moment, two figures appeared in his mind.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Qiu Yue.</p><p>He knew very well that Qiu Yue was interested in him.</p><p>Also, Xie nianqing.</p><p>How was she now? He had disappeared for such a long time?</p><p>At this moment, for some reason, Xie nianqing’s figure was particularly clear in his mind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>Mu Tian shouted coldly, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had kidnapped the bride on the way and challenged the sacred constellation. This matter would spread throughout the Tianxuan region very quickly.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming did not marry Mu Lan. What would the others think of Mu Lan and him then?</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes flickered as if she had thought of something. Her eyes were a little dejected as she said softly,”Father, please don’t misunderstand. I’m asking Lu Ming for help because I don’t want to marry the sacred constellation. I don’t mean anything else. Moreover, Lu Ming is still young, so he should focus on martial arts.”</p><p>“LAN ‘er!”</p><p>Mu Tian looked at Mu Lan with a complicated expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Senior Sister Mu Lan!”</p><p>Lu Ming said apologetically.</p><p>It wasn’t that Mu Lan wasn’t beautiful enough or that she wasn’t good enough. To be honest, which man wouldn’t be tempted by a woman like Mu Lan? It would be a lie to say that Lu Ming was not tempted.</p><p>However, he really didn’t have any thoughts of getting married.</p><p>Moreover, there were two other people in his heart.</p><p>why are you saying sorry? I have to thank you for today. From now on, I’m free!</p><p>Mu Lan smiled sweetly. Her smile was bright and charming, like a blooming flower.</p><p>“Father, senior Yan, I’m a little tired. I’ll go back and rest first.”</p><p>With that, Mu Lan turned around and strode away.</p><p>However, the moment he turned around, Lu Ming saw the sadness in Mu Lan’s eyes.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Yan kuangtu rolled his eyes and thought, ” it seems that my little brother Lu is also a Playboy. He still has someone else in his heart.</p><p>Thinking of this, Yan kuangtu naturally didn’t say a word. It was very difficult for outsiders to say anything about this kind of thing.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Mu Tian cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and snorted coldly. He then turned to Yan kuangtu and said, Lord Yan, it’s been a long time since I’ve returned to the Tianxuan region. Why don’t we go for a drink? ”</p><p>well, good. It’s time to have a good drink. Old man mu, I remember that you’ve secretly kept some good wine. I’ve always wanted to drink it but couldn’t. It’s time to take it out now!</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll definitely take it out this time.”</p><p>Mu Tian said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you want to go for a drink? this old man’s private collection is really good!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’d better not go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He did not know why, but he felt a little guilty and could not face mu Tian.</p><p>“Alright then, I’ll take my leave!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind. He did not say anything else and left with mu Tian.</p><p>At the scene, there were waves of excited discussions.</p><p>What happened today was really full of twists and turns, beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming, who they thought was hiding and would not dare to fight, appeared at the critical moment. Furthermore, he displayed terrifying strength and actually defeated a peerless genius, the sacred constellation.</p><p>This was truly terrifying. If Lu Ming broke through to the peak-tier King realm, how powerful would his combat strength be?</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to win, Shangguan Wu Chen made a strong move to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He had never expected that the person standing behind Lu Ming would be the legendary Yan kuangtu.</p><p>In the end, the Sheng family was completely defeated and had to retreat in embarrassment.</p><p>I believe that today’s matter will soon spread throughout the entire Tianxuan region.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name would also resound throughout the Tianxuan region. He was the number one genius in the Tianxuan region.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
