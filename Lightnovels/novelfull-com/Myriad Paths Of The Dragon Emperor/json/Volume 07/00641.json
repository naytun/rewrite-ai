In the end, it was Lu Ming who was in the wrong.</p><p>What could Lu Ming say? He could only tell himself in his heart that he should never try to reason with a woman, because his reasoning might not be her reasoning.</p><p>With a smile, Xie nianqing’s figure flashed. He grabbed dandan and placed her on her shoulder. Then, he rose into the air and flew to the West.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and chased after him.</p><p>The distance from here to the chaotic Astral Ocean was not close. It was almost as far as half of the Yunfeng region. Even with their speed, it would still take them nearly ten days to fly.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re cultivating the destruction and wind concepts, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked on the way.</p><p>that’s right. The intent of destruction is something I comprehended from my bloodline!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>those two concepts don’t seem to have fused together!</p><p>do you think it’s that easy to merge two intents together? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming. Then, he thought of something and said,”Unlike you, you’re so perverted!”</p><p>“I can teach you some experience in the fusion of wills. How about it? Do you want to learn?” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes brightened. Indeed, Lu Ming had successfully fused three concepts. If she had Lu Ming’s experience, she might really be able to fuse two concepts together.</p><p>If she could really merge the destruction and wind concepts, her sky demon power field would be raised to a terrifying level.</p><p>“You’re not that kind to teach me?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>of course I’m not that kind. I have conditions. Come, give me a kiss, and I’ll tell you the method of fusion!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Kiss you?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was as red as a ripe apple. He glared at Lu Ming and said, ” “I knew it, you pervert, you wish!”</p><p>After saying that, he even gritted his teeth.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then forget it. I can’t do anything about it. Who asked me to be a pervert?”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted her teeth. The look in her eyes kept changing. Then, she stared at Lu Ming with her eyes wide open. Her face turned redder and redder. In the end, she actually closed her eyes slowly and raised her mouth to kiss Lu Ming on the face.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he retreated a few meters away. He smiled and said, ” “Little Qing, what are you doing? It was just a joke, did you really take it seriously? Hahaha!”</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>A shrill scream came from Xie nianqing’s mouth.</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed and glared at Lu Ming. He gritted his teeth and wanted to bite Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, she bared her teeth and pounced on Lu Ming, ready to bite him.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged it and flew forward, shouting, ” “Nest, the tigress bit me!”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“No! I won’t stop!”</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and one escaping, disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>Time passed day by day. Along the way, Lu Ming would occasionally tease Xie nianqing. He was in an extremely good mood.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t going to be stingy. He shared some of his experience with Xie nianqing.</p><p>On top of that, he also gave Xie nianqing a bunch of destruction intent crystals.</p><p>The destruction ultimacy crystal was one of the many ultimacy crystals that Lu Ming had obtained in the heaven realm.</p><p>When Xie nianqing saw Lu Ming take out a large pile of destruction ultimacy crystals, there were even quite a few middle-grade ultimacy crystals. He could not help but be dumbfounded.</p><p>Of course, she kept it without any hesitation. Then, she took out a martial arts secret manual and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>The exploding star fist, a superior heaven level martial arts technique, could burst out a terrifying power when combined with the concept of fire, like the explosion of stars.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. His current attack methods were indeed a little monotonous. With this book on the exploding star fist, he would have more attack methods.</p><p>He had obtained some martial arts secret manuals from others before. However, they were either heaven level low-rank martial arts manuals which Lu Ming did not care about at all. Most of them had to be cultivated together with the weapon and were not suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was just the right person for this martial arts technique.</p><p>The two of them were not in a hurry to travel. They cultivated as they traveled.</p><p>If he had any comprehension, he would stop and cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the exploding star fist was also improving rapidly.</p><p>What was originally a ten-day journey took the two of them more than twenty days to arrive.</p><p>The chaotic stars city was located on the shore of the chaotic Astral Ocean. It could be considered the common border between the Yunfeng area and the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>The chaotic stars city could be said to be the most prosperous city in the cloud Peak region.</p><p>Everyone who wants to enter the chaotic Astral Ocean from the direction of the cloud Peak area has to go through the chaotic Star City.</p><p>There were countless merchant associations and caravans gathered here.</p><p>The chaotic Astral Ocean can be said to be the largest inland ocean in the East continent. Its surface area is even larger than many large domains. There are many precious materials and strange treasures inside that can not be found in the outside world.</p><p>Therefore, there are countless Chambers of Commerce that take the risk to enter the chaotic Astral Ocean, search for the materials and treasures unique to the chaotic Astral Ocean, and sell them in other big regions. They can obtain rich profits.</p><p>And these Chambers of Commerce all had to set off from chaotic stars city.</p><p>“It’s really lively!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked to the streets of the chaotic stars city. They could not help but sigh as they looked at the people coming and going on the streets.</p><p>There were shops on both sides of the street. There were all kinds of wonderful materials and items from the sea. Lu Ming had never seen them before and it was an eye-opener for him.</p><p>After walking around for a while, the two of them headed towards the harbor outside the city.</p><p>The so-called port in chaotic stars city was not a place for ships to dock, but a place for flying demonic beasts to dock.</p><p>This is because there are a lot of aquatic demonic beasts living in the chaotic Astral Ocean. These aquatic demonic beasts possess unparalleled strength in the ocean. They are capable of summoning clouds and rain and are incomparably powerful.</p><p>If a ship sailed on the sea, it would definitely be destroyed by the sea demon beasts.</p><p>Therefore, the majority of the people who enter the chaotic Astral Ocean Ride on flying demonic beasts.</p><p>Of course, riding on a flying demonic beast is not completely without danger. In the chaotic Astral Ocean, the weather is constantly changing, so you might encounter a storm or a thunderstorm at any time.</p><p>The storm and lightning rain were not ordinary ones. Some of them were so terrifying that even kings would die inside.</p><p>In addition, the greatest danger in the chaotic Astral Ocean is Pirates. Pirates are everywhere and Rob passersby.</p><p>The only outcome for those who were robbed was death!</p><p>Therefore, any martial artist who wants to enter the chaotic Astral Ocean will enter in groups. The most common way is to follow some caravans.</p><p>The caravans had powerful forces and would hire some guards with high cultivation. Therefore, as long as he gave them some spirit crystals, they would agree to go with him.</p><p>The benefits were mutual. One side could get the protection of the caravan’s military force, while the other side would have more people in the caravan, which would be more powerful.</p><p>They were using each other.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also wanted to find a caravan to go with them.</p><p>It’s not that they’re afraid of the Pirates of the chaotic Astral Ocean, but because the ocean is too big. If they don’t have someone to lead the way, it’s very easy for them to get lost.</p><p>They planned to first follow the caravan into the chaotic Astral Ocean. Then, they would train while waiting for other people with the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure to appear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
