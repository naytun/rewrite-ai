They were almost a hundred meters wide. They grabbed the shark’s mouth and broke it. The shark’s mouth was split in half. Even its body was almost torn apart. Blood gushed out.</p><p>A gargantuan ape emerged from the ocean. It opened its mouth, which was filled with teeth, and bit the shark, tearing off a large piece of shark meat.</p><p>this is a water ape! It’s so powerful! It’s at least equivalent to a peak-tier King!</p><p>“Not good, it’s targeting us!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>At that moment, the water ape’s huge eyes looked up at the sky, filled with a brutal aura.</p><p>Fortunately, it only took a few glances before it grabbed the shark’s corpse and slowly sank into the sea, disappearing.</p><p>the demonic beasts in the ocean are really powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>The most amazing thing was that the monstrous beasts in the sea were too huge. They were often hundreds of meters long or thousands of meters long. On land, there were very few such huge bodies, unless they were some powerful monstrous beasts that had inherited the bloodline of divine beasts.</p><p>In the ocean, the law of the jungle was displayed even more vividly.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fly. Along the way, he saw more huge and powerful sea beasts.</p><p>One time, they encountered a sea beast that looked like a flood Dragon. It was two thousand meters long, and its aura was boundless. It was definitely a sea beast equivalent to the spiritual ocean tier. Fortunately, they had avoided it from a distance, or else the consequences would have been unpredictable.</p><p>No wonder it’s said that ships can’t move forward in the chaotic Astral Ocean. If a ship is on the ocean, it will definitely be torn to pieces by these huge sea beasts.</p><p>Five days later.</p><p>there’s a thunderstorm ahead. Turn right and move forward!</p><p>Feng Fengshi shouted as he rode on the first four-winged Flying Tiger.</p><p>The people of the flame caravan immediately changed direction and flew to the right.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had been seven days since they set out to sea.</p><p>Lu Ming focused on comprehending the concept of Thunder and the exploding star fist. He spent the rest of his time cultivating his mental energy fire.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had already cultivated the explosive star fist to the second level during the journey. Its power was already considered not bad.</p><p>After all, he lacked practice and it was not good to take out the path-understanding ancient tree to cultivate. The cultivation speed was naturally not fast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>On the evening of the eighth day, a series of buzzing sounds suddenly rang out in front of him as the sound approached at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Not good, it’s swordfish, a school of swordfish!”</p><p>A loud roar reverberated through all the four-winged Flying Tigers.</p><p>“Get ready, get ready for battle!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a dazzling attack had already erupted in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s four-winged Flying Tiger was at the back of the formation and was not attacked. He looked forward.</p><p>The sky in front of him was densely packed.</p><p>They were a type of fish, a type of fish with wings. They were about half a meter long and had sharp mouths like arrows.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>These fish were known as swordfish. They flapped their wings, and their bodies shot out like arrows, piercing through the air and making tearing sounds.</p><p>Most of these fish were only at the martial arts Grandmaster level, but there were too many of them.</p><p>A small number of them had reached the level of a martial King.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Colorful attacks flashed out, and large numbers of flying arrowfish were killed, falling into the sea like raindrops.</p><p>everyone, attack! Quickly kill this school of flying swordfish and leave this place!</p><p>Chen Zhao roared as he hovered in the air. With a single palm strike, thousands of flying arrowfish were killed, showing the strength of a Lv 7 martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and did not make a move. Although there were many flying swordfish, their combat strength was not strong. They could not cause much harm to the caravan and did not need his help.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing had no intention of making a move. He continued to sit cross-legged.</p><p>As expected, it didn’t take long for the school of swordfish to be almost all killed. The caravan successfully charged out and continued to fly forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest. It was Chen Zhao.</p><p>At that moment, Chen Zhao’s face looked even colder. He stared at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and said, ” “Why didn’t the two of you make a move just now?”</p><p>His tone was very unfriendly, and he questioned her in a commanding tone.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He did not like it when others spoke to him in such a tone. Therefore, he naturally did not look happy. He said indifferently, ” just a few flying swordfish, we don’t need to do anything. When we’re needed, we’ll naturally attack!</p><p>“Haha, I don’t need you to do anything. What a joke, do you think you’re peerless experts? It’s ridiculous, I think you guys don’t even dare to attack, afraid of death!”</p><p>Chen Zhao laughed and revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said coldly, ” it’s none of your business whether we’re experts or not. Besides, we’ve paid the spiritual crystals for this trip. I’ve never heard of any rule that states that we must take action.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s expression froze.</p><p>Indeed, there wasn’t a rule that stated that people had to pay spiritual crystals and go with the caravan.</p><p>In fact, people like Lu Ming and the rest did not need to do anything.</p><p>It was just that many people would help when they encountered danger. It was also to prevent the caravan from getting into trouble and to rush to the destination as soon as possible.</p><p>“Chen Zhao! That’s enough!”</p><p>At this moment, Luo Xin flew over and chided them. She then smiled at Lu Ming and the other man. “Young master Lu, miss Xie, Chen Zhao has a short temper. I hope you don’t mind!”</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted coldly. Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not say anything.</p><p>“If you’re weak and afraid of death, just say it!”</p><p>Chen Zhao said coldly and left, flying forward.</p><p>“Young master Lu, miss Xie, I’m sorry!”</p><p>Luo Xin smiled apologetically and left.</p><p>“You’re looking down on me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and touched his nose.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want to help, but that he had already seen that the swordfish basically didn’t pose a threat to the caravan. It didn’t matter whether they helped or not, so they didn’t help.</p><p>If the caravan were to encounter a crisis that they couldn’t handle, they naturally wouldn’t sit by and do nothing.</p><p>A small disturbance passed just like that, and the caravan continued to move forward.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two days passed.</p><p>On the evening of the tenth day, a small island appeared in front of them.</p><p>ahead is translation Island. Let’s go down and rest for the night. We’ll set off tomorrow!</p><p>Luo Xin’s voice was heard.</p><p>The four-winged Flying Tiger had been flying for ten days. No matter how strong it was, it was still tired and needed to rest. It couldn’t keep on flying.</p><p>The four-winged Flying Tiger roared and flew toward the island below.</p><p>This Island was not big, with a radius of about a thousand miles. It was originally a place for some caravans to rest.</p><p>They landed on a huge square on the island.</p><p>manager Yan, the flame Chamber of Commerce is here. Please prepare some good food for us!</p><p>A burly man flew down from the flame caravan and shouted.</p><p>Huge stone houses were built on the side of the square.</p><p>In the past, the caravans that passed by would rest here and eat something.</p><p>However, no one responded after the burly man called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
