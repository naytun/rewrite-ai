He didn’t even see how the two people appeared.</p><p>...</p><p>These two people were naturally Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The scar-faced man heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s age.</p><p>How much of a threat could two young men in their twenties pose? it seemed like he had been too careless earlier and had not noticed them.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Luo Xin, Chen Zhao, and the rest also saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“What are the two of them doing here? Are you looking to die?”</p><p>Chen Zhao couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>young master Lu, in this situation, the flame Chamber of Commerce can’t even protect themselves. They can’t protect you either. You’d better run for your lives. If you’re lucky, you might be able to escape. Hurry!</p><p>Luo Xin’s character wasn’t bad. At this time, she could still think of others.</p><p>leave, not a single one of them can leave. Haha, there’s actually such a beauty in the world. What luck!</p><p>At this moment, the scar-faced man’s eyes were fixed on Xie nianqing’s body, burning with fire.</p><p>“Fifth brother, the previous one is yours, this Girl Is Mine!”</p><p>The skinny man’s eyes were similar. He stared at Xie nianqing, his eyeballs almost falling out.</p><p>It was too beautiful, too beautiful.</p><p>Luo Xin was considered a pretty beauty, but compared to Xie nianqing, she was nothing.</p><p>They kept sighing and rejoicing. Their luck today was too good.</p><p>Luo Xin sighed. It’s over. Xie nianqing is so beautiful. Now that he’s been targeted by two peak-tier kings of the blood Fiend Pirates, how can he escape?</p><p>Xie nianqing’s brows furrowed, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>“All of you will die!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cold voice startled everyone.</p><p>Xie nianqing actually wanted to kill two peak-tier Pirate Kings? what a joke.</p><p>little Qing, leave these two guys to me. I’m looking for someone to practice my fist Arts with. You go help the others!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cold eyes swept across the knife-scarred man and the skinny man. alright, I’ll leave them to you. Don’t kill them easily, I’ll do it!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The others were dumbfounded. What were Lu Ming and Xie nianqing doing? Could it be that in their hearts, the knife-scarred man and the skinny man were trash that could be killed at will?</p><p>These were two peak-tier King tiers!</p><p>A newborn calf was really not afraid of a Tiger.</p><p>“Senior, you go help the others. Leave these two to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and said to the peak-tier King from the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The old man was also a little stunned.</p><p>“Brat, you’re trying to be a hero on my head. It’s your mistake. Die!”</p><p>The scar-faced man shouted coldly and slashed his saber at Lu Ming. The blood-red saber ray whistled through the air and slashed at Lu Ming’s head. The power was stronger than before.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Luo Xin subconsciously exclaimed.</p><p>“I’ll use you guys as practice!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile as he threw a punch.</p><p>The space trembled with the exploding star fist. A fiery red fist light shot toward the saber Light of the knife-scarred man like a meteor.</p><p>Wherever the fist radiance passed, the air was directly turned into liquid due to its ferocity. The liquid wrapped around the fist radiance and collided with the saber radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening sound, the knife light of the knife-scarred man was directly shattered and disappeared without a trace. Not only that, but the remaining fist light also hit the knife-scarred man and forced him to retreat.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Luo Xin, Chen Zhao, and the others ‘eyes almost popped out, and their mouths were wide open as they stared blankly.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually destroyed the saber flare of the burly man on the bus, who had been extremely arrogant just now, with one punch and forced him to retreat.</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so terrifying?</p><p>Expert, this was a top expert.</p><p>The scar-faced man’s expression changed drastically as well. He had never expected Lu Ming to have such powerful combat strength.</p><p>“Come over here!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw a punch. A dazzling fist radiance pierced through the void and headed toward the thin bamboo pole.</p><p>The skinny man wanted to stop Xie nianqing, but Lu Ming quickly pulled him over. It wasn’t easy to find a few training targets. It would be a pity if Xie nianqing killed him in one move.</p><p>The explosive fist radiance created a huge pressure on the skinny man. He could only block it with all his strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist radiance exploded, and the thin bamboo pole was blown away for a thousand meters.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill this little bastard!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The skinny man and the knife-scarred man joined forces. Both of them unleashed their full strength and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw two punches in a row. The fist radiance burst out, tearing through the void a thousand meters away and blasting toward the two of them.</p><p>With two loud bangs, the two of them were sent flying by the fist radiance.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately after, two more fist lights pierced through the void and headed toward the two of them.</p><p>The fist energies seemed to be endless. The knife-scarred man and the skinny man were completely suppressed and were at a disadvantage.</p><p>This was the result of Lu Ming suppressing his quintessential essence and his explosive star fist. Otherwise, he would have been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing’s voice was heard. She pressed her hand down and a terrifying sky demon force field covered a thousand meters. All the blood Fiend Pirates, regardless of whether they were late-stage Kings or ordinary Kings, were cut into pieces and died.</p><p>Luo Xin and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>geniuses! I didn’t expect that we would have two peerless geniuses in our team this time. We’re so lucky!</p><p>The elder at the peak of the king’s realm sighed, his face filled with joy.</p><p>“Yeah, I really didn’t expect this!”</p><p>Luo Xin also sighed.</p><p>As for Chen Zhao, he felt his face burning. He thought of what had happened two days ago. At that time, he had pointed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, saying that they were afraid of death and that their cultivation levels were low, so they did not dare to attack.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, every word he said was like a pair of slaps on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. They did not make a move. Under such circumstances, there was no need for them to make a move. When there was a need, they would naturally make a move.</p><p>However, he was mocking Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it, you made me lose face. Isn’t it just a peak-tier King? My big brother is much stronger than them!”</p><p>Chen Zhao felt rather upset. He felt that Lu Ming had embarrassed him.</p><p>let’s attack together and kill these Blood Fiend Pirates!</p><p>The old man’s figure flashed as he charged towards the blood Fiend Pirates.</p><p>With the help of the old man and Xie nianqing, the blood Fiend Pirates were killed in large numbers.</p><p>Especially Xie nianqing, once the sky demon force field was released, a large group of Pirates were enveloped and had no way to escape.</p><p>The more the blood Fiend Pirates fought, the more frightened they became. The fiendish Qi from before had already subsided, and what was left was fear.</p><p>retreat, retreat! The enemy has too many peak-tier Kings!</p><p>Some of the blood Fiend Pirates shouted. They had already lost their fighting spirit.</p><p>The moment their fighting spirit disappeared, their combat strength became weaker, and more people were killed.</p><p>The flame Chamber of Commerce had the upper hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
