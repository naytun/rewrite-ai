This meant that Yun Haitang had placed this person on the same level as her.</p><p>More importantly, he could enter Yun Haitang’s courtyard at any time. As the saying went, the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first. If he came into contact with Yun Haitang more often, he might develop feelings for her.</p><p>Most of the men, young or old, had eyes full of anticipation.</p><p>Those who knew their own limits sighed inwardly, knowing that it wouldn’t be them.</p><p>haha, I think miss Haitang is most likely talking about you, young master Gu.</p><p>that’s right. Among this group of people, who has less alchemy skills than Gu? I’m envious, envious!</p><p>The few people beside Gu Huaxu started to suck up.</p><p>hey, it might not be me. Maybe there are people who are better at alchemy. You should know that there is always a higher mountain!</p><p>Gu Huaxu said humbly. Although his words were humble, the pride on his face could not be concealed.</p><p>Haitang, he must be talking about me. Could it be that he has secretly taken a fancy to me? otherwise, why would he let me go to his courtyard to discuss alchemy? haha, it must be so!</p><p>Gu Huaxu thought to himself.</p><p>congratulations, young master Gu. You’ll be returning with a beauty soon.</p><p>Someone even whispered beside Gu Huaxu, making him laugh so hard that he couldn’t close his mouth.</p><p>“Haitang, who is the person you are talking about who is so skilled in alchemy?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Yu Haitang smiled and said,”this person is young and has a graceful bearing. He is a young man …”</p><p>“Haitang, you’re too polite. I’m not worthy of your praise.”</p><p>As soon as Yun Haitang finished speaking, Gu Huaxu stood up and pretended to be humble.</p><p>Many people also looked at Gu Huaxu with envy. In their eyes, the person Yun Haitang was talking about must be Gu Huaxu.</p><p>However, Yun Haitang looked at Gu Huaxu in shock and said, ” “Brother, what are you doing? I’m not talking about you.”</p><p>The smile on Gu Huaxu’s face froze.</p><p>The entire place suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>After a while, someone couldn’t hold it in anymore and laughed out loud.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s expression was too funny. Some people tried their best to hold it in until their faces turned red, while some people laughed out loud.</p><p>The few people who were flattering Gu Huaxu just now were also frozen there.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s body trembled, and his handsome face turned red.</p><p>It was embarrassing. It was too embarrassing.</p><p>It turned out that the person Yun Haitang was talking about wasn’t him at all. To think that he was still thinking about his own wishful thinking. He had lost a lot of face.</p><p>And what did Yun Haitang call him? Brother? She didn’t even know his name.</p><p>Gu Huaxu wished there was a crack in the ground so he could just jump in. In the end, he could only sit down with a red face.</p><p>The few people beside him did not even dare to look at him.</p><p>“The hero I’m talking about is called Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled and continued.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the people around them looked at each other. Who was Lu Ming? How come I’ve never heard of it?</p><p>Only one person widened his eyes in surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming, she’s not talking about you, right?”</p><p>Xie nianqing widened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>She had also taken a glance at the pills that Lu Ming had refined back then. How was it possible?</p><p>if there’s no other person named Lu Ming at the scene who is equally graceful, then this Lu Ming should be me!</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>“Really shameless!”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming, but he was still very curious.”Don’t tell me that the pill you refined has some sort of skill?”</p><p>“Hehe, maybe miss Yun Haitang has taken a fancy to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Shameless!” Xie nianqing said in disdain.</p><p>At this moment, Yun Haitang’s gaze fell on Lu Ming. “Brother Lu, what do you think of Haitang’s suggestion?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and finally confirmed that Yun Haitang was talking about him. He smiled and stood up.”Thank you, Haitang. I think it’s very good!”</p><p>Yun Haitang’s face lit up with joy. “Brother Lu’s alchemy skills, this little sister admires you very much. In the future, please guide me.”</p><p>“Haitang, you’re too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>impossible, how could it be him? Haitang, you must be mistaken!</p><p>At this time, a gloomy voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice. It was Gu Huaxu.</p><p>“Oh, how did I get it wrong?”</p><p>Yun Haitang asked.</p><p>miss Haitang, the pill this man refined yesterday was not well-proportioned in color and did not have a strong medicinal fragrance. It was clearly a useless pill. This man’s alchemy skills are a mess. Miss Haitang, don’t be fooled.</p><p>Gu Huaxu shouted.</p><p>that’s right, Haitang. I also saw that this person basically doesn’t know how to make pills!</p><p>“Yes, I saw it too!”</p><p>Around them, many other people also spoke.</p><p>“Oh? Don’t you trust my judgment?” Yun Haitang asked, still smiling.</p><p>miss Haitang, it’s not that we don’t trust your eyes, but I’m guessing that this guy used some method at the last minute to exchange for the pill. The pill he gave you was not refined by him at all.</p><p>Gu Huaxu shouted.</p><p>Initially, when he saw that Xie nianqing was with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing ignored him when he greeted him, he was already very unhappy with Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, it was because of Lu Ming that he had lost all his face. Now that he had the chance to embarrass Lu Ming, he would naturally seize the opportunity and not let it go.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Yun Haitang nodded slightly. A Jade bottle appeared in her hand, and she poured out a pill. Holding it in her hand, she asked, ” “Are you guys talking about this pill?”</p><p>“This is the pill!” Gu Huaxu was stunned and nodded.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s this one!”</p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p>“That’s good. I said that brother Lu’s alchemy skills are superb because of this pill!”</p><p>Yun Haitang said with a smile.</p><p>“How could this be? This is clearly a useless pill!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s face was filled with shock.</p><p>“A useless pill? You guys watch carefully!”</p><p>The green spiritual fire on Yun Haitang’s finger flowed through it. The next moment, lines of inscriptions appeared on the surface of the pill, intertwining with each other. It was extremely beautiful.</p><p>“This … The inscription was hidden and the medicinal effect was deeply locked. How was it possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Gu Huaxu cried out in disbelief.</p><p>After all, he was a level-four Alchemist born in the world of alchemy, so he had a good eye. Naturally, he could see the truth of the pill at a glance.</p><p>The others also widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>The inscription was introverted, this was not something that ordinary people could do.</p><p>Only those who had a profound understanding of inscriptions and were proficient in them could do it. This represented a certain realm, and only grandmasters in the alchemy world could do it.</p><p>As far as everyone knew, there were only three people in the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy who could do this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
