At this moment, Xie nianqing looked like a goddess who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p>“I don’t know why? The destruction intent and the wind intent are always lacking a little and can’t be combined!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>could it be that the destruction intent is too strong, so the rejection force is stronger? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>Indeed, it was as Lu Ming had guessed.</p><p>The will of destruction was an extremely powerful and terrifying will. It could destroy everything and was even more powerful than the star will of the Saint stars.</p><p>As for the wind concept, it was one of the nine commonly seen concepts. Compared to the destruction concept, there was still a gap.</p><p>Hence, it was even more difficult to fuse them.</p><p>This was like a poor man and a rich man trying to become friends. It was very difficult.</p><p>However, it was much easier for two poor people or two rich people to become friends.</p><p>The destruction intent realm was equivalent to the rich, while the wind intent realm was equivalent to the poor. They were on different levels, and to put it more accurately, it was the destruction intent realm, which disdained to merge with the wind intent realm.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment, then said,”Little Qing, try to use this to comprehend!”</p><p>He waved his hand, and the path-understanding ancient tree appeared on the ground.</p><p>At first, Xie nianqing was stunned, but after sensing it, her expression changed drastically. As she sensed it more carefully, her expression became more and more interesting.</p><p>“This … Could this be the legendary path-understanding ancient tree?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming, his voice trembling. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>that’s right. I’m lucky to have obtained a withered branch of the path-understanding ancient tree. I didn’t think that it would actually sprout.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>you’re showing me such a valuable thing. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll have evil thoughts and take it away? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Will you?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Xie nianqing laughed out loud. At this moment, her smile was extremely bright and happy. Her beautiful eyes blinked as she stared at Lu Ming, as if she wanted to carve him into her heart.</p><p>“How is it? Are you very touched and are you going to devote your life to me? I’m not ready yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>promise your head! Hmph, lend me this path-understanding ancient tree for two days!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s mouth twitched, and his eyes flashed. “Since you’re so sincere, I’ll reward you!”</p><p>With that, Xie nianqing suddenly stood on his tiptoes and kissed Lu Ming on the cheek. Then, with a flushed face, he hugged the pill furnace that was planted with the ancient tree of enlightenment and ran to the side to cultivate.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched the spot where Xie nianqing had kissed him and smiled foolishly.</p><p>“Brat, why did you come here? you made this Lord search for you!”</p><p>Dandan’s voice was heard. It strode with its short legs and ran wildly in the air, flying toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Have you finished carving the inscription and inscription formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan.</p><p>yes, it’s done. I’m so tired, but let me tell you, my cultivation is limited. The highest I can inscribe is level five inscriptions and some level five inscription arrays. I can’t do anything higher. I need to recover more first!</p><p>Dandan spat out more than ten Jade tokens and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Only level five?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Little brat, I’m telling you, don’t underestimate my inscription and inscription formation. I have mastered many inscriptions and inscription formations that you don’t have here. They are all very rare and powerful. Many of the formations are not inferior to those level six formations. With your spiritual power, the power you can exert is definitely not weaker than Ordinary Level six formations!”</p><p>Dandan explained proudly.</p><p>“Oh? Seeing that you’ve worked so hard, these spirit herbs are your reward.”</p><p>Lu Ming took out some level five spiritual herbs and threw them to dandan.</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth. With its status, why did it need others to reward it? it was always the one who rewarded others. Now, Lu Ming, this young fellow, actually took out a few level five spiritual herbs and said that it was a reward.</p><p>This made dandan so angry that her turtle shell fluctuated.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Don’t, don’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, yes, of course I want it!”</p><p>Dandan hurriedly put away the spirit herbs, warning herself in her heart that she had no choice but to lower her head when she was under the roof.</p><p>Then, he ran away happily.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Jade card that dandan gave him and started to read it.</p><p>Some were Level 4 and Level 5 inscriptions, while some were all kinds of inscriptions and formations.</p><p>After Lu Ming read it, he began to comprehend it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>Xie nianqing returned the path-understanding ancient tree to Lu Ming.</p><p>“How is it? Any gains?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’ve gained something. Come, let’s fight. I need strong pressure!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I want, I was just looking for you to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, and the earth’s force emanated from his body.</p><p>He also wanted to fight Xie nianqing and combine the earth Force with the other three intents.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened and he exclaimed, ” “Earth Force, you’ve actually comprehended Earth Force again?”</p><p>“Yeah, there’s no other way!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly.</p><p>“What a freak!”</p><p>Xie nianqing mumbled. Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a while, deafening rumbles sounded on the island. In the sky above the island, two figures kept clashing, and the sky kept shaking.</p><p>After exchanging a few hundred moves, the two of them stopped and began to comprehend.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Every day, the two of them would take out a period of time to fight to promote the fusion of intent.</p><p>In the rest of his time, Lu Ming would cultivate the prison-suppressing heaven technique, comprehend and cultivate various inscriptions, and fight with inscriptions.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained a lot. He was improving every day.</p><p>He was already able to inscribe many inscriptions and inscription formations that dandan had given him.</p><p>As for the prison-suppressing heaven technique, Lu Ming had already cultivated it to his feet.</p><p>Every punch, palm, and kick of Lu Ming seemed to contain a prison-suppressing stele that suppressed everything.</p><p>However, using the prison suppressing heavenly art really consumed too much true Yuan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was much more vigorous than other martial artists of the same realm. However, it still consumed a lot of energy and he could not sustain many moves.</p><p>He would use more than half of his primeval essence after a few moves.</p><p>It should be known that even sea of soul realm experts rarely had low-grade demigod level martial skills. Many low-level sea of soul realm experts had cultivated high-level heaven level martial skills.</p><p>Some unaffiliated cultivators, who were poorer, still cultivated heaven level lower class martial arts techniques.</p><p>Normally, only high-level sea of soul realm experts could fully unleash the power of low-grade demigod martial techniques.</p><p>“The prison suppressing heavenly art can be my trump card. I’ll try not to use it often!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>As for the earth Force, its fusion with the other three intents was also progressing very quickly. It was only a little bit away.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had the experience from the previous two times. In addition, the earth Force was still very weak. It would be faster to merge it.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, after such a long period of cultivation, he finally managed to merge the destruction and wind concepts successfully.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat strength increased rapidly. The power of the fusion of the destruction and wind concepts shocked Lu Ming.</p><p>On this day, the key to the Martial Emperor’s treasure finally changed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
