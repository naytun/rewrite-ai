This spiritual practitioner han Dao was really shameless.</p><p>...</p><p>Previously, when he was fighting the flood Dragon, in order to escape, he did not care about the life and death of others. He let others block the flood Dragon for him while he escaped.</p><p>In fact, with the spiritual practitioner han Dao’s strength, it should not be a problem for him to resist the flood Dragon for a while and delay until the red monster and the others arrived. However, he would not do that. He would rather let others sacrifice their lives so that he could try his best to protect himself.</p><p>Now, he actually wanted to do the same thing again. He wanted Lu Ming to risk his life to kill the flood Dragon. After killing the dragon Queen, he would ask Xie nianqing to attack the array base. Did he think that the others were fools?</p><p>If he didn’t agree, he would threaten him. So what if he was at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier?</p><p>old man, I have a weakness. I hate it when people threaten me. The more they threaten me, the more I’ll go against them. As I said before, I happen to know some inscriptions. It’s been too long since this formation was inscribed, and its power has been greatly reduced. The spiritual crystals in some places have been depleted. It seems that I need to replenish some spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Little bastard, you dare?”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao’s face was cold.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid? You’re nothing in my eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and flew to the side of the square.</p><p>On the side of the square, there were some potholes, which were the array bases. On them, there were many Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>However, some of the spiritual crystals had already cracked and lost their spirituality. They no longer had any energy.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at a pit and swiped his finger. The useless spiritual crystal in the pit flew out. A perfect Supreme-grade spiritual crystal appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He waved his hand and the Supreme-grade spiritual crystal was embedded in the pit.</p><p>The inscriptions around the pit brightened up a little.</p><p>“Stop, you stop!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao roared.</p><p>“Stop? sure, but kneel down and beg me!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and smiled at the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>“Kneel down and beg you? Little bastard, Who Do You Think You Are? How dare you tell me to kneel down and beg you?”</p><p>The spiritual being han Dao was stunned for a moment, then he roared.</p><p>“If you don’t want to kneel, then forget it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers kept moving, taking out pieces of useless top-grade spiritual crystals and embedding the intact ones. He was very fast and before long, he had embedded hundreds of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>The inscriptions of the formation became brighter and brighter, and its power became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Little bastard, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s killing intent was bone-chilling and he hated Lu Ming to the bone.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, the flood Dragon let out an earth-shaking roar and actually stepped towards the side of the square.</p><p>As soon as it moved, the inscription formation started to run crazily. Countless inscriptions seemed to come to life and turned into swords and sabers, slashing at the flood Dragon.</p><p>The flood Dragon roared loudly, and a heavenly halberd appeared in his hand. He swung it wildly, trying his best to block the attacks from all directions.</p><p>Clearly, the flood Dragon was very decisive. It knew that if this continued, the situation would become more and more disadvantageous for it. It wanted to rush out of the formation with all its might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sabers and swords formed by the inscription formation were terrifyingly powerful. There were so many of them that it seemed like there was no end to them as they continuously hacked at the flood Dragon.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Even though the flood Dragon’s defense was astonishing, it was still cut open by the sharp sword, and blood flowed out.</p><p>However, the flood Dragon didn’t care and madly charged out.</p><p>With every step it took, the White jade ground would rumble. Countless inscriptions enveloped the flood Dragon and even turned into flames that enveloped the flood Dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a deafening roar, the flood Dragon returned to its original form, which was only a dozen meters long. Its body shot out beams of blue divine light as it slashed with the heavenly halberd.</p><p>Even so, with every step the flood Dragon took, a wound would appear on its body. At the same time, it had to face the burning of the flames.</p><p>as expected of a flood Dragon. What a strong body!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>A human martialist would not have been able to withstand such an attack. However, the flood Dragon held on and continued to charge out, getting closer and closer to the outside of the formation.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao and the Crimson old monster were burning with anxiety.</p><p>If the flood Dragon got out first, the treasures in the hall would fall into the flood Dragon’s hands.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s enter the main hall first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. If the flood Dragon came out, they would not be a match for it with their combat strength.</p><p>The two of them walked along the side of the square and were about to rush towards the main hall.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The flood Dragon roared as its two dragon horns glowed with a brilliant light. Two rays of blue divine light, like two extremely sharp swords, pierced through the inscription formation and shot toward Lu Ming and the other man.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his infinite Dragon Spear. The tremendous force sent Lu Ming and Xie nianqing flying backward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear kept vibrating in his hand. Fortunately, it was a superior sixth-grade spiritual weapon. If it was a fifth-grade spiritual weapon, it would have been shattered by the blow.</p><p>The flood Dragon let out a long roar. It didn’t care about its injuries and madly charged out, its speed greatly increasing.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the flood dragon actually rushed out of the inscription formation, but in exchange, it was covered in wounds.</p><p>There were at least dozens of wounds on the flood Dragon’s body. Its dragon scales were torn, and its blood and flesh were in a mess. Some of the wounds exposed its snow-white bones, and even the bones were cut open. However, the flood Dragon’s body was too strong, and its vitality was exuberant. Such a heavy injury only weakened its breath a little, but it did not fall down.</p><p>It looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing but did not make a move. Instead, it rushed into the hall.</p><p>this flood Dragon is rushing towards the hall in such a hurry. There must be some incredible treasure inside. Let’s go in and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing also nodded.</p><p>Although the flood Dragon was powerful, it was too severely injured to maintain its peak combat strength. If the flood Dragon attacked them, they were confident that they could escape together. That was why they dared to follow it.</p><p>The two of them followed the flood Dragon and rushed into the hall.</p><p>“Damn it, damn you little bastard!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao roared. He didn’t dare to charge in like the flood Dragon, as he didn’t have a strong body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the flood Dragon rushed into the hall one after another.</p><p>The hall was very wide. As soon as he rushed into the hall, Lu Ming felt an immense pressure. Even his nine Dragon bloodline was agitated. A red light filled Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the center of the hall in shock.</p><p>There was a ball of fresh blood floating there. On the surface of the ball of blood, there were tiny true dragons swimming around. A huge pressure spread out.</p><p>This pressure was like the pressure of the ancestor of all beasts, the King of all kings. It was extremely terrifying and could make all living things submit.</p><p>“True dragon, the blood of a true dragon!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could speak, dandan, who was on his shoulder, cried out first.</p><p>The blood of a true dragon. Yes, this ball of blood was the blood of a true dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were both extremely shocked.</p><p>They had never imagined that the seven-colored Daoist’s Palace would actually have a ball of true dragon’s blood. Furthermore, this ball of true dragon’s blood was clearly sentient, as if it had just flowed down from a true dragon.</p><p>The value was high.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
