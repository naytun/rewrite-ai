We can’t miss the Martial Emperor’s treasure, no matter if it’s real or fake! Jian feiliu’s eyes were extremely firm.</p><p>A heaven’s pride expert was a heaven’s pride expert not only because of talent and perseverance, but also because one had to firmly grasp the opportunity. If there was an opportunity in front of them, but one did not dare to grasp it, then one could not be called a heaven’s pride expert.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Jian feiliu rushed toward the vortex together.</p><p>As soon as he entered the vortex, Lu Ming felt a strong tearing force from the surrounding seawater, acting on his body.</p><p>However, this power could only pose a threat to martial arts grandmasters. It was nothing to them.</p><p>The three of them followed the vortex and went down.</p><p>Very soon, they reached the bottom of the sea, but they did not stop. There seemed to be a huge cave at the bottom of the sea. It was pitch black inside the cave. From inside, there was a strong suction force that pulled Lu Ming and the others down.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he was extremely small under this attractive force. It was difficult for him to resist.</p><p>The next moment, he, Xie nianqing, and the others disappeared from the cave.</p><p>It was pitch-black all around him. There was no sound or movement. Lu Ming could only feel that his body was constantly descending. He had no idea where he was going to land.</p><p>could it be that the Martial Emperor’s treasure is deep underground? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>He kept descending. He did not know how long he had been descending for. Suddenly, Lu Ming felt that the sky and earth were spinning, as if he had taken a cross-domain teleportation array. The next moment, he found himself in midair and his body was falling rapidly.</p><p>He hurriedly circulated his essential core and his expression changed slightly.</p><p>He found that the circulation of true Yuan here was much more obscure than before, as if it was facing a strong resistance.</p><p>Even flying became more strenuous than before, and the speed of flying had slowed down a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his body and floated in the air, sizing it up carefully.</p><p>There was no moon or sun in the sky, but there seemed to be stars high up in the sky. However, these stars were all Crimson and scattered with Crimson light.</p><p>This was where the light source was.</p><p>Below him was an endless land.</p><p>“Where is this place? Is it some other region or deep underground?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Previously, he felt that he was falling to the ground.</p><p>“Little Qing, Jian feiliu is gone!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, with a thought, dandan appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>Before he came in, Lu Ming had already stuffed dandan into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“Dandan, do you know what this place is?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes scanned the surroundings. After pondering for a moment, she shook her head and said, ” I don’t have any impression of this place. It’s so strange. It doesn’t seem to be on the ground!</p><p>Since he did not know, Lu Ming did not ask further. He sized it up for a while and then landed on the ground.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>After landing on the ground, Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This piece of land was actually a Cemetery. As far as the eye could see, there were huge tombs everywhere, one after another, connected together.</p><p>“There’s someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a figure flash in front of him. It was a peak-tier King.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and followed them. Slowly, he realized that there were more and more people in front.</p><p>In the end, he found that there were about a thousand people in front of him, scattered over there.</p><p>“Everyone, do any of you know what this place is?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. Didn’t they say it was the Martial Emperor’s treasure? Why did it land here? there are tombs everywhere, where is the treasure?”</p><p>“Or, the Martial Emperor’s treasure is somewhere else? We need to find it ourselves!”</p><p>that’s true. If it really is a Martial Emperor’s treasure, it won’t be so easy to get it.</p><p>Everyone chimed in, expressing their own opinions.</p><p>“Little bastard!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar was heard. Lu Ming could feel a cold killing intent enveloping him.</p><p>He turned around and saw a burly man with a murderous look in his eyes. The man was glaring at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the brawny man from the blood poison sect, Zhong Mo.</p><p>This person was an expert at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. He did not expect to meet the burly man the moment he entered this place.</p><p>The burly man’s face revealed a ferocious smile. A powerful aura emanated from his body, like a vast ocean that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Nearby, the others couldn’t help but make way.</p><p>The attack of a third level spiritual ocean tier powerful being was extremely terrifying. They were afraid of being affected.</p><p>“Little bastard, this is your fate. You are destined to die in my hands. Let’s see how you’re going to run away today!”</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the burly man strode toward Lu Ming like a wild beast trampling on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated at top speed. With every step he took, he would stomp on the ground and a ray of light would flash.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>When the burly man rushed over, runes appeared on the ground, forming a long spear that pierced through the air. The power of the spear was extremely terrifying, and even a sea of soul realm expert would be killed if he was not careful.</p><p>However, the burly man threw a punch and shattered the Spear’s radiance. He continued to charge toward Lu Ming without stopping.</p><p>“Little bastard, although your Dao of inscription is strong, how can a formation you set up in a hurry do anything to me? I will definitely kill you today!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The burly man shouted and punched out with both fists. Two mighty fist auras were blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently, and the space seemed to be pierced through. A terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming, causing his muscles to tighten.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and runes appeared, forming two shields in front of him. His figure retreated rapidly.</p><p>With two loud explosions, the two shields were shattered. The fist force did not stop and continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The third level of the spiritual ocean realm at its peak was too powerful. Lu Ming was no match for it.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s current Dao of inscription was extremely powerful, it was still only at level five.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to avoid the fist radiance. He was about to use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps again to leave this place when …</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All around them, a sharp sound suddenly rang out. From all directions, endless arrows shot towards them, covering the sky and the earth, enveloping everyone in it.</p><p>“Not good, there are people here!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed. They used their cultivation to block the arrows from all directions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Just as they were about to knock the arrows away, the arrows suddenly exploded. The power was extremely terrifying, and many low-rank Kings were instantly killed, screaming in pain.</p><p>More than ten arrows exploded around Lu Ming, causing him to take a few steps back.</p><p>As for the burly man, he didn’t know if it was because the strength he had just shown was too strong or because he was unlucky, but there were actually hundreds of arrows shooting at him. Although they didn’t hurt him, they made him quite embarrassed.</p><p>“Fire!”</p><p>A loud shout came from the distance. Immediately, another wave of arrows came from all directions. They were so dense that they covered the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
