The three-colored concept surrounded his body. He held a long spear in his hand and his long hair fluttered in the wind. He stood still, straight as a mountain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A huge three-colored true dragon with thick scales roared and pounced toward the Saint planet.</p><p>It was the same true dragon Strike, but its momentum was much stronger than before.</p><p>Saint Starlight bellowed in rage. With a wave of his hand, a small tower shimmering with Starlight appeared in front of him. The small tower rapidly expanded and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Holy constellation had already lost all confidence and started to defend.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The three-colored true dragon pounced on the small star Tower, and the small star Tower was directly sent flying. The Saint star retreated at an extreme speed, and its body trembled slightly. A trace of blood was left at the corner of its mouth.</p><p>He was injured.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not give him any chance to catch his breath. His long spear turned into a shocking spear radiance. It was incomparably huge and smashed down on him with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>This spear directly smashed the Holy star a thousand meters away, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“Sacred constellation is going to be defeated!”</p><p>heavens, I never thought that there would be someone in the Tianxuan region who could defeat the sacred constellation!</p><p>The people at the scene stared at the sky with wide eyes, extremely shocked.</p><p>Ever since the rise of sacred constellation, it had been unrivaled. No one could compare to it. In the Tianxuan region, no matter what kind of geniuses or monstrous talents they were, they were all trash in front of sacred constellation. There was no way to compare them.</p><p>His cultivation speed was terrifying, and his combat strength was unparalleled. He had suppressed the younger generation of the Tianxuan region to the point where they couldn’t even breathe. In the competition between the younger generation, he had never lost a single battle.</p><p>After that, the sacred constellation even left the Tianxuan region and went to other large regions to cultivate and compete with the geniuses of other large regions.</p><p>How’s the battle record? The others didn’t know, but he was listed on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>It had been many years since anyone from the Tianxuan region had made it onto the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. This was enough to prove everything.</p><p>The Holy star had too much light on it.</p><p>However, was such a peerless heaven’s favorite going to be defeated today?</p><p>To be defeated by someone younger than him and with a lower cultivation?</p><p>Many people thought they were dreaming.</p><p>“Damn you, you little bastard!”</p><p>Seeing that Holy constellation had been sent flying, its mother, Shangguan Wu Ling, screamed with a ferocious face.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At the side, Shangguan wuchen slapped the chair handle and shouted in a low voice. Then, he flicked his finger and a stream of energy pierced through the void and entered Lu Ming’s body without a sound.</p><p>None of the martial King realm martial artists present felt it.</p><p>Beside Shangguan Wu Chen, Sheng Cang’s brows raised and a cold smile appeared on his face.</p><p>On the other side, mu Tian’s expression changed slightly. His eyes flickered with a trace of displeasure, but he did not move.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was like a rainbow. Just as he was about to finish off the Holy star in one go, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>He felt an unfamiliar true essence suddenly appear in his meridians. This true essence was like a prehistoric beast, rampaging in his meridians. His meridians swelled in pain, and the true essence in his body was almost scattered by this true essence.</p><p>despicable! He actually tampered with it secretly!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was sharp. The first person he thought of was the middle-aged man, the uncle of the sacred constellation.</p><p>“Stars, attack with all your might!”</p><p>At this time, Shangguan Wu Chen’s voice rang in Holy constellation’s ears.</p><p>Holy constellation had thought that they would definitely lose today. However, at this moment, their eyes lit up and they let out a long roar. The light of the stars boiled, crossing the void and charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The dazzling sword light was aimed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and waved his long spear to block.</p><p>But now, the quintessential essence in Lu Ming’s body was scattered and his meridians were swollen and painful. He could not use ten percent of his quintessential essence and his combat strength was greatly reduced. He was sent flying thousands of meters away by the sword of Holy stars.</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>WOWO, you’re really despicable and shameless. You actually used such a despicable method!</p><p>On Lu Ming’s shoulder, she shouted loudly.</p><p>Dandan’s voice spread far and wide.</p><p>At the scene, everyone looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming clearly had the upper hand and was about to win. Why did he suddenly stop his attack, and the sacred constellation suddenly showed its might and injured Lu Ming with one move?</p><p>Hearing dandan’s cry, some people’s eyes flickered and they had all kinds of guesses in their hearts.</p><p>Could it be that someone was secretly interfering with Lu Ming?</p><p>Mu Lan, mu Zheng, mu xiuyuan, and the others ‘eyes flickered with anger as they looked at the high platform where the Sheng family was.</p><p>Only a powerful being of the spiritual ocean tier would be able to do something like this without anyone knowing.</p><p>“What do you mean by someone did something? This little b * stard has obviously cultivated some kind of evil cultivation technique that has greatly increased his combat strength in a short time. Now, the side effects are acting up!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling said coldly.</p><p>Seeing that Holy constellation had the upper hand, she was overjoyed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>How could the sacred constellation miss this opportunity? violent attacks poured toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>“Dammit, swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline with all his might. A powerful devouring force was produced at his spine, and it devoured the primordial Qi.</p><p>At the same time, he was barely able to block the attacks of the sacred constellation.</p><p>Like this, he was naturally no match for the Holy star. He was sent flying, and he spat out another mouthful of blood. He felt waves of intense pain coming from his inner mansion.</p><p>“It’s useful!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He could feel that the true essence was being devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Although the true essence was struggling like a wild beast, it was still slowly being devoured.</p><p>block it. I only need to block it for a dozen breaths. Then, this true essence will be devoured.</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with three kinds of intent and circulated the essential core that he could control, trying his best to resist.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The others could see that Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage and could only resist passively. Under the storm of attacks from the Holy star, he was like a lonely boat in the ocean that could be destroyed at any time.</p><p>“Die, die, you little bastard, you still want to fight with my son!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling’s heart let out a low roar of resentment.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan clenched her fists tightly. She was extremely worried.</p><p>“Soon, soon!”</p><p>One breath after another passed.</p><p>The true essence was being swallowed by the bloodline of the nine Dragons inch by inch.</p><p>Two more inches, one more inch …</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, die! You want to compete with me? ”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen laughed.</p><p>Today, he had to win. Although he had guessed that it was his uncle’s doing, what did it matter? It was fine as long as he could win.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He slashed out a powerful sword light, aiming for Lu Ming’s neck. He had already decided to kill Lu Ming and did not mind finishing him off now.</p><p>“Oh, really? You only know how to use such underhanded methods, yet you’re still worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as me!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and the aura on his body exploded.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A three-colored true dragon flew out. The Saint planet was caught off guard and was directly blown away. Cracking sounds came from its chest. It was unknown how many bones were broken. It flew two thousand meters away and blood spurted out of its mouth. Its eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>“The stars!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen slapped the chair again, and a murderous look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually broken his essential core.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
