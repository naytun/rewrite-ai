Boom! Boom!</p><p>...</p><p>The ocean in the distance rumbled and the waves surged.</p><p>Everyone stood in the air and looked from afar. They could see a white line on the sea surface surging towards them. It was a wave, a shocking wave.</p><p>the patrols in the distant sea have sent back news that a large number of sea beasts are charging towards us. Prepare for battle!</p><p>An old man in a plain robe appeared in the sky. His voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>The aura he exuded was as vast as the ocean and extremely shocking.</p><p>This was a great expert of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sound of the waves became even more shocking. Everyone felt the sky and the earth shake violently.</p><p>The huge waves were accompanied by the roars of sea beasts.</p><p>The waves were getting closer and closer, and everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>The waves were too shocking. They were at least a thousand meters high and seemed to reach the clouds, washing them away.</p><p>There were countless sea beasts rolling in the waves.</p><p>“That’s the blood shark clan!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>In one of the waves, everyone saw countless blood-red Sharks. These sharks were extremely huge, and any one of them was dozens of meters long. They were blood-red in color and constantly roared, filled with a murderous aura.</p><p>It was unknown how many of them there were.</p><p>“The swordfish race!”</p><p>“The sea lion race!”</p><p>“Tiger shark clan!”</p><p>……</p><p>Everyone saw a total of nine sea beast tribes, divided into nine regions, with waves rushing toward them. The number of each tribe in each region was uncountable. There were too many.</p><p>“Look, there are people on the waves!”</p><p>“There’s a person in the sky above every race!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>As expected, there was a figure standing on the waves in each of the nine tribes. They were walking on the waves, and the aura on their bodies was shocking.</p><p>that’s not a human. That’s a demon that has taken form, the king of their respective tribes!</p><p>Above the crowd, the sea of soul realm warrior said with a serious tone.</p><p>“What? Shapeshifting great demons? all the shapeshifting great demons of the nine great clans had come? How is that possible?”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm.</p><p>A level six demonic beast was equivalent to a martial artist’s spiritual ocean tier. It could already transform into a human form, so it was also called a transformation-type great demon.</p><p>transformed demons each lead a clan and occupy a Sea area. There are only seven sea beast clans near our golden sand island. Why are nine here? ”</p><p>this beast tide is too shocking. In the past, there would only be some small-scale beast tides, and very few sea of soul realm beasts would appear.</p><p>The scene was noisy, and some people’s eyes showed fear.</p><p>The rapidly approaching waves, countless sea beasts rolling and roaring, gave people a strong pressure.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, figures appeared one after another, each of them exuding an ocean-like aura.</p><p>Spiritual ocean tier, all of them were at the spiritual ocean tier, and there were a total of ten of them.</p><p>This made many Warriors calm down a little.</p><p>All the sea of soul realm Warriors hiding in golden sand island had appeared.</p><p>that’s spiritual practitioner han Dao! Spiritual practitioner han Dao has also appeared!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Among the ten sea of soul realm experts, there was an old man in a white robe. His aura was the most terrifying, and he was much stronger than the other sea of soul realm experts.</p><p>haha, that’s great. I heard that spiritual practitioner han Dao has been in seclusion for sixty years. This beast tide has actually alerted him. With him here, we’ll be much more confident.</p><p>Someone saw the white-robed man and laughed excitedly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were mixed in the crowd, looking at the sky.</p><p>golden sand island is really amazing. There are so many powerhouses hidden here!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed in his heart.</p><p>In the crowd, other than the ten spiritual ocean tier experts, there were many other powerful auras that rose up like smoke.</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming could sense that there were no less than five hundred peak-tier King auras.</p><p>The Golden sand island alone had no less than five hundred peak-tier Kings, which was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Chaotic Astral Ocean, it’s indeed the chaotic Astral Ocean. The number of experts here is too many. Every day, a lot of evil, fierce and ruthless people from every big domain in the eastern wilderness enter the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>However, a King has a lifespan of a thousand years. After so many years, the number of experts in the chaotic Astral Ocean has already been unknown.</p><p>It had definitely reached an astonishing number.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The waves were getting closer and closer, and the air was filled with fiendish Qi.</p><p>“Kill, kill all the human warriors!”</p><p>On the blood shark clan’s territory stood a burly man in a blood-red robe. At this moment, he was shouting loudly, his voice rumbling.</p><p>This was the king of the blood shark clan, a great demon that had taken human form.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Countless sea beasts roared and pounced toward the island.</p><p>Demonic beasts could speak when they reached level five, which was the king-level.</p><p>all Warriors below the martial arts Grandmaster realm, retreat. Warriors above the martial arts Grandmaster realm, attack the sea beasts with all your might. If anyone retreats and refuses to fight, kill them without mercy!</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao’s overbearing voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>However, no one refuted. Everyone knew that in the current situation, if someone retreated without a fight, then more people would follow suit. Golden sand island would not be able to survive.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Besides the spiritual warrior han Dao, the other nine sea of soul realm Warriors all roared and charged at the beasts with terrifying power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sea of soul realm expert and the demon beast clashed together, creating a huge explosion.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other human warriors roared and charged at the sea beasts.</p><p>The two sides collided with each other.</p><p>All kinds of sword Qi, blade radiance, palm prints, and fist energy struck the waves. The waves exploded, and the sea beasts in the sea rushed out and fought with the human warriors.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. As soon as they came into contact with each other, a large number of sea beasts were killed. At the same time, there were also human warriors who died miserably. The battle had been extremely fierce since the beginning.</p><p>Among the human race, apart from the Warriors below the martial arts Grandmaster realm, only the cold saber Spirit Warrior did not make a move. He stood in the void and looked around. As the strongest force of the human race, he had to control the overall situation in case of an unexpected situation.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked side by side and charged forward.</p><p>Their area was the territory of the Tiger sharks.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The tiger shark’s cry was similar to that of a fierce tiger. Its roar was like thunder, and its teeth were sharper than knives as it bit at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Spear’s gleam pierced through a tiger shark that was more than thirty meters long. Its blood dyed the sea red.</p><p>This tiger shark was equivalent to a Lv 7 martial King.</p><p>The devouring power burst out and devoured the tiger shark’s blood essence.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field enveloped them and killed five or six tiger sharks.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flashed and he devoured all the blood essence.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hands and Lu Ming charged forward.</p><p>Wherever the spear radiance passed, huge tiger sharks died in his hands.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh …</p><p>A few scimitars tore through the air and headed for Lu Ming’s neck. Lu Ming swept his long spear and deflected the scimitars.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
