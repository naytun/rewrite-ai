They were shocked by the strength of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>One of them had killed a peak-tier King with a single move.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he had killed hundreds of experts, including many Lv 9 martial King realm upper tier King realm experts.</p><p>The strength of the two was very shocking.</p><p>Those who had been coveting Xie nianqing’s beauty at the start felt a chill in their hearts. They were secretly glad that they didn’t make a move. Otherwise, they would be the ones who died.</p><p>Now, they no longer looked at Xie nianqing with fire and greed in their eyes. There was only fear and dread.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd. He could see everyone’s expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming had a deeper understanding of the word ‘chaotic chaotic Astral Ocean’.</p><p>Chaotic Astral Ocean, if you’re soft-hearted, then everyone will bully you.</p><p>However, if one’s methods were more ruthless and brutal than others, then everyone would be afraid of him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered and he devoured the blood essence of all the members of the lone wolf adventurer team.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, he left with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Soon, the two of them returned to the city.</p><p>The two of them plan to first find an inn to stay in, then buy a map of the chaotic Astral Ocean. After that, they will find a suitable place to go and train.</p><p>When the two of them returned to the city, they saw many people flying in one direction.</p><p>“Go to the life battle platform! The King of Hell has made his move again. I heard that his opponent this time is old monster Qi Chan!”</p><p>“What? The King of Hell and old monster Qi Chan are going up against each other. It’s been years since old monster Qi Chan fought. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“This battle will definitely be spectacular.”</p><p>One figure after another quickly flew in one direction.</p><p>“Life battle stage?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were both stunned and curious.</p><p>From the looks of it, it was a battle between two experts. What kind of expert could attract so many people to watch?</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, the two of them followed the crowd and walked forward.</p><p>Soon, they arrived in front of a huge building.</p><p>The building was round and huge. When they got close, they heard loud cheers and screams.</p><p>could it be that the battle has already begun? we can’t be late, right? let’s go in quickly!</p><p>Many people flew to the entrance of the building.</p><p>pay the full bill. 200 Best-grade spirit crystals per person!</p><p>At the gate, there were guards who stopped the crowd and shouted.</p><p>“These are my spiritual crystals, take them!”</p><p>Many people paid the spiritual crystals and rushed into the building.</p><p>However, there were too many people and they had to line up.</p><p>there are so many people here. It seems that King Yama and old monster Qi Chan are not ordinary!</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>After a while, it was their turn and they walked in.</p><p>The interior of the building was circular. In the middle was a huge fighting stage that was several miles long and wide. Around it were circular stands. There were more than a hundred levels, and at least a few hundred thousand people could sit there.</p><p>After the two of them walked in, they found that there were at least 100000 people sitting in the stands.</p><p>The fighting ring was empty. There was no one there, only a pool of blood.</p><p>“What’s going on? Where was he? Wasn’t it King Yama fighting against old monster seven Dhyana? Why don’t I see him?”</p><p>“Yeah, where are they?”</p><p>The people who came in after him called out.</p><p>“People? He only came now, where was he? The war has ended.”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“What? The war had ended, but what was the result? Who won?”</p><p>Yama, Yama won. Yama and old monster Qi Chan fought for a hundred moves and in the end, old monster Qi Chan was killed by Yama!</p><p>sorry, I’m late. I’ve wasted 200 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Let’s watch the other duels!”</p><p>Many people who had arrived late sighed and looked for a seat.</p><p>“Young master Lu, thank you, young lady!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming heard a delicate cry.</p><p>“Luo Xin!”</p><p>He turned around and saw a young woman walking towards him. It was Luo Xin.</p><p>Beside Luo Xin, there were two other people. One of them was Chen Zhao, and the other was in his thirties. He had a burly figure and looked similar to Chen Zhao.</p><p>“Miss Luo!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>young master Lu, Lady Xie, what a coincidence. Are you here to watch the battle on the fated battle platform? ”</p><p>Luo Xin said with a smile.</p><p>“That’s right, but I seem to have missed it!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. Hell King is a top-notch expert who has risen recently. He has never lost a battle at the peak-tier King level and has won 19 consecutive battles. With this battle, he has already won 20 consecutive battles.</p><p>“As for the seven Zen elder, he’s lived for almost eight hundred years and has cultivated for so many years. His battle-power is also extremely terrifying, and he’s almost unparalleled among peak-tier Kings. He also won nineteen consecutive victories on the life battle platform, and many people are looking forward to their battle. I didn’t expect that this battle would come so suddenly. It’s a pity that we missed it!”</p><p>Luo Xin said, also showing a trace of pity.</p><p>a battle between peak-tier Kings, nineteen consecutive wins? ”</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed an interested look.</p><p>young master Lu, Lady Xie, there should be other battles coming up. Let’s find a place to sit down!</p><p>Luo Xin said.</p><p>Then, they found an empty space and sat down.</p><p>On the side, Chen Zhao’s face was gloomy and he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure rushed into the fighting ring. It was a bald old man, and the aura of a Lv 7 martial King realm expert was fully revealed.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>The old man shouted.</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>A bald man rushed up to the stage, also revealing his Lv 7 martial King realm cultivation.</p><p>“Haha, really? Your storage ring is mine!”</p><p>The old man sneered.</p><p>“I should be the one saying that. I’ve taken a fancy to your storage ring.”</p><p>The bald man also sneered. A saber appeared in his hand and he charged at the bald old man.</p><p>The bald old man took out an iron rod and welcomed the attack.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>However, after a few dozen moves, the bald old man had the upper hand.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>The bald old man laughed as he swung his iron rod at the bald man like a storm.</p><p>The bald burly man kept retreating. After more than ten moves, the bald old man hit the bald burly man’s chest with his stick. The bald burly man screamed in pain, and a series of bone-cracking sounds came from his body. He was sent flying back and fell on the fighting ring, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“Admit defeat? It’s too late to admit defeat now, die!”</p><p>The bald man roared and flew up. The iron rod smashed on the bald man’s head, and the bald man’s brain instantly burst open, dying on the spot.</p><p>“Haha, the storage ring is mine!”</p><p>The bald old man put away the bald man’s storage ring and laughed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
