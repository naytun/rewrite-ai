Normal peak-tier Kings would be instantly killed by them.</p><p>If he was alone, he had the confidence to defeat and kill him.</p><p>But with the four of them working together, he felt great pressure.</p><p>Especially …</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm, but he was already so powerful. This made him tremble in fear.</p><p>the battle of karmic luck is about to begin. All these freaks have been mobilized!</p><p>Yun Luo felt a little bitter.</p><p>hehe, while it’s rare for a King to kill a spirit sea expert, there have been a few in history.</p><p>Gu Huaxu sneered and licked his lips.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not waste any words and attacked directly.</p><p>He had devoured a large amount of blood essence, so he had to end the battle as soon as possible and refine the blood essence.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming moved, the other three moved as well. Each of them unleashed their unique skills and charged towards Yun Luo.</p><p>The sky instantly boiled over. The violent attacks caused the entire world to shake. Wisps of energy seeped out and fell to the ground.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Each wisp of Qi was like a bombshell. Mountains and rivers exploded, and palaces collapsed.</p><p>The cloud Sea Alchemy Academy was in shambles.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>The disciples of the cloud Sea alchemy institution screamed and ran. Some of them were too slow and were killed by the explosion.</p><p>The five figures turned into five dazzling lights and engaged in a life-and-death battle in the sky.</p><p>But at this time, Yun Luo was already completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>A moment later, blood splattered in all directions as an arm was cut off. Yun Luo let out a beast-like roar, and suddenly, a blood-red light filled the air. Yun Luo turned into a blood-red light, rushed out of the encirclement, and quickly went far away.</p><p>“Four little B * stards, just you wait. I will definitely take revenge for my broken arm!”</p><p>His voice rumbled and reverberated between heaven and earth, but he had already gone far away.</p><p>Yun Luo had escaped.</p><p>“What a pity, he escaped!”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. The four of them did not have an overwhelming advantage over Yun Luo to begin with. It would not be that easy to kill her. It was already good enough that they were able to leave her with an arm and severely injure her vitality.</p><p>hehe, if the other party doesn’t die, he’ll definitely take revenge. I won’t be accompanying you!</p><p>Gu Huaxu sneered. He looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing before his figure flashed and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This guy was cautious. He left immediately after the battle was over. He was most likely afraid that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing would find trouble with him.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming would not mind getting rid of him if he had the chance. Gu Huaxu gave Lu Ming a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>“May I know how I should address the two of you?”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun cupped his fists at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Xie nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing answered.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Xie nianqing? I’ve never heard of it before. It seems that we’ve really entered a golden era with countless geniuses. If the list of top 1000 talents is re-arranged, I doubt I’ll be squeezed out of it!”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun said with a bitter smile.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked like they were in their twenties, but they had such cultivation and combat strength. He was shocked.</p><p>“Brother li is too modest. I’ve heard of brother Li’s great name like thunder!”</p><p>Lu Ming was being polite.</p><p>“What are your plans next? Did you come here to go to the chaotic Astral Ocean as well?”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun asked curiously.</p><p>“Not bad.” Lu Ming nodded. He had nothing to hide.</p><p>“The battle of Kismet is approaching. Now, many geniuses have been mobilized. As far as I know, many geniuses have entered the chaotic Astral Ocean recently to train themselves. After I’ve settled the affairs of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, I’m also planning to go to the chaotic Astral Ocean to adventure!”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun said with a smile.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Indeed, the chaotic Astral Ocean is incomparably chaotic. It’s an unreasonable place where people may attack you at any time. There’s no lack of life and death battles there.</p><p>Under such an environment, it was indeed possible for one to constantly improve and break through.</p><p>Because if he didn’t break through, he would most likely die.</p><p>It was normal for many geniuses to enter it to train.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>Li Xiaoyun was ranked 943rd on the list of top 1000 talents, which was dozens of places higher than the Saint planet. His battle strength was much stronger than the Saint planet’s.</p><p>Li Xiaoyun could easily defeat Saint Starlight.</p><p>He was only a few dozen ranks higher and he was already so powerful. How powerful would those geniuses who were ranked higher be?</p><p>Not to mention the geniuses who had reached the Sea of Souls realm, there must be many geniuses who were stronger than Li Xiaoyun in the martial King realm. Lu Ming really wanted to meet them.</p><p>“Brother li, we’ll take our leave then!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He was in a hurry to find a place to refine the blood essence.</p><p>“Alright, when we meet again, we must have a good drink!”</p><p>Li Xiaoyun said with a smile.</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left, two figures appeared beside Li Xiaoyun and bowed, ” “Young master!”</p><p>send the news to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the Yunfeng region and get someone to deal with this Cloud Sea alchemy institution. Using the connate blood Qi to refine pills is an evil and crooked way!</p><p>Li Xiaoyun said coldly.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The two old men bowed.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing flew to the West. After flying for hundreds of thousands of miles, they landed in a mountain range.</p><p>The two of them planned to cultivate in seclusion here for a while.</p><p>Xie nianqing wanted to use the heavenly demon fruit to cultivate the heavenly demon force field, while Lu Ming wanted to refine his blood essence.</p><p>“Dandan, help us guard the area!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>ten Level 5 spiritual herbs!</p><p>Dandan demanded an exorbitant price.</p><p>“Two, or not a single one,” Lu Ming threw him two.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Dandan was helpless and could only grab two spiritual herbs to guard at the side.</p><p>Xie nianqing sat cross-legged, took out the heavenly demon fruit, and began to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged a hundred meters away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the bloodline of the nine Dragons, a huge amount of blood essence was being refined.</p><p>This time, he had obtained the blood essence of over twenty late King tiers, including eight peak-tier King tiers. The blood essence was simply too rich.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline had already accumulated to a certain level, reaching the limit of a seventh level King bloodline. This time, it broke through directly.</p><p>Eight silver chakras flashed and disappeared. The nine Dragon bloodline had advanced to the eighth level King realm.</p><p>Fortunately, Xie nianqing was also in seclusion, otherwise, his jaw would have dropped.</p><p>“Bloodline of the nine Dragons, Nine Dragons, why does it sound so familiar? Sigh, I can’t remember.”</p><p>Not far away, dandan was mumbling while gnawing on spirit herbs.</p><p>let’s see if I have enough Supreme-grade spirit crystals. If I have enough, I can break through to the peak-tier King realm.</p><p>More than ten storage rings appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Lu Min and Xie nianqing each took twelve storage rings from the twenty over Kings from the cloud Sea alchemy institution.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind sank into it and he gathered all the top-grade spiritual crystals together.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
