It’s also very pure, and its medicinal effect is deeply locked. It’s more than 30% better than the most top grade level 2 energy cultivation elixir. Now, is there anything that you’re not convinced about? ”</p><p>...</p><p>Yun Haitang’s eyes swept across the crowd.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>“How could this be? You should die!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared in his heart. He looked at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>Today, he had really lost a lot of face.</p><p>It was embarrassing before, and even more so now.</p><p>He sat down with a gloomy face.</p><p>He was extremely jealous of Lu Ming.</p><p>Not only was there a rare beauty by Lu Ming’s side, but he also had the opportunity to interact with Yun Haitang. He was so jealous that his eyes were about to burst into flames.</p><p>“You bastard!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was speechless. She realized that he could never see through Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu, take this Begonia flower and you can enter my courtyard at any time!”</p><p>Yun Haitang waved her hand and a Begonia flower flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a Begonia flower sculpted from beautiful jade, as if it was real.</p><p>“Thank you, miss Haitang!” Lu Ming reached out to receive it and smiled.</p><p>Then, he sat down with a smile.</p><p>pervert, you can’t move after seeing a beautiful woman. You’re indeed a perverted man!</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted in disdain.</p><p>“You’re not jealous are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing with a smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed and pouted, ” who’s jealous? don’t be so smug. Who would be jealous of you? Hmph, go and find your Haitang girl. But let me tell you, this Haitang flower is very prickly. Don’t get yourself into trouble before you get to take advantage of her.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>“I’ll get her token of inscription!” Lu Ming smiled and sent a voice transmission.</p><p>“Everyone!”</p><p>At this moment, Yun congsheng, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke.</p><p>“I also want to learn from Haitang and choose a person with great alchemy skills. He can come to me at any time to discuss alchemy.”</p><p>Yun congsheng’s words made many women’s spirits rise, especially some young women. They looked at Yun congsheng with burning eyes, hoping to attract his attention.</p><p>Yun congsheng’s eyes turned and finally landed on Xie nianqing. His eyes flashed with a fiery light and he smiled gently, ” miss Xie nianqing, I admire your alchemy skills. You can come to my courtyard anytime to discuss alchemy with me. How about it? ”</p><p>The crowd followed Yun congsheng’s gaze and looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>so it’s her. No wonder she attracted Yun congsheng’s attention!</p><p>The same thought flashed through many people’s minds.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s beauty was known to everyone. Other than Gu Huaxu, there were more than ten other young men who tried to talk to Xie nianqing, but they were all chased away by Xie nianqing.</p><p>Many girls looked at Xie nianqing with jealousy, but they also sighed in their hearts. They knew that they couldn’t compare to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, Xie nianqing’s reply was a cold one-no interest.</p><p>The smile on Yun congsheng’s face froze.</p><p>He didn’t expect Xie nianqing to reject him so directly. How could he get out of this situation?</p><p>“Miss Xie, please consider it!”</p><p>Yun congsheng’s face turned cold.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Xie nianqing rejected her without hesitation.</p><p>Yun congsheng’s face darkened.</p><p>He had heard from others that there was a beautiful woman in this group, which was why he had come out with Yun Haitang. As soon as he arrived, he saw Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s beauty moved his heart. He had wanted to learn from Yun Haitang and let Xie nianqing interact with him more. After a while, how could Xie nianqing escape from his grasp?</p><p>However, he didn’t expect Xie nianqing to reject him so blatantly.</p><p>“Good, good, very good!”</p><p>good! Yun congsheng said. A vicious look flashed in the depths of his eyes. Then, he turned around and left.</p><p>Xie nianqing pursed his lips and didn’t take it to heart.</p><p>Yu Haitang glanced at Xie nianqing. No one knew what she was thinking, but she smiled and said, ” alright, today, I will be explaining some knowledge of alchemy. If Haitang says something wrong, everyone can raise it and we can discuss it together!</p><p>Then, Yun Haitang sat cross-legged on a futon and began to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming also listened to it seriously.</p><p>Although his mastery of inscriptions had reached a certain level, he was still a little rusty in alchemy.</p><p>Otherwise, the pill wouldn’t have such an uneven color.</p><p>To be honest, Yun Haitang did have a deep understanding of the art of alchemy. Lu Ming was like a sponge, absorbing the knowledge of alchemy like crazy.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s lecture went on for three hours before she ended it.</p><p>The crowd also dispersed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when do you plan to make your move?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked on the way.</p><p>“In two days, find an opportunity to take action and seize the token of inscription.” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hey, I say, don’t be unable to resist the temptation of beauty!” Xie nianqing glared at Lu Ming and said worriedly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming suddenly looked at her. Without blinking, he suddenly approached her and whispered, ” “Don’t worry, I can definitely withstand other people’s beauty, but I can’t withstand your beauty.”</p><p>“You … You … Pervert!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and he kicked out. Lu Ming laughed and flew back, avoiding the kick and moving forward.</p><p>hey, this guy, why is his luck so good? he can meet beautiful women everywhere he goes. I’ve never met so many beautiful women in the nine Heavens and ten lands!</p><p>Dandan sighed repeatedly. She was ‘jealous’ of Lu Ming.</p><p>Soon, they were close to the dormitory.</p><p>A few figures blocked the two’s path.</p><p>Gu Huaxu and a few other young men.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. It seemed that Gu Huaxu could not hold it in any longer.</p><p>“What business do you have here?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What business do you have? Kid, don’t you know what you’ve done wrong?”</p><p>A young man beside Gu Huaxu shouted.</p><p>that’s right. Today, you’ve embarrassed young master Hua. You’ve committed a heinous crime. Do you know your crime? ”</p><p>Another young man followed suit.</p><p>“I embarrassed him? Haha, how laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“Kid, what are you laughing at? What’s so funny about that?”</p><p>Gu Huaxu said coldly.</p><p>“Isn’t it funny? Did I embarrass you? You asked for it, alright? In the beginning, before Haitang could finish, you stood up by yourself.”</p><p>“And later on, you were the one who stood up and said that my pills were not good enough. From the beginning to the end, have I ever said a single word? If you didn’t ask for this, then what?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“How dare you! If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t have lost face in public! If it wasn’t for you, the first place would have been me!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He really did not understand the logic of this brother.</p><p>He didn’t have the ability, yet he blamed everything on others. How ridiculous was this?</p><p>This was akin to blaming others for their good grades when one could not be the top scorer. Lu Ming could not understand such logic.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
