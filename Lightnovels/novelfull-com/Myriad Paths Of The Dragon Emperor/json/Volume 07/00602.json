Lu Ming shouted. A Spear’s gleam rushed out of his body and soared into the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sacred glory’s giant flaming palm was directly crushed by the spear radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and swept his spear at the huge ring.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The huge ring kept shaking, and the red flames were almost scattered. The ring made a cracking sound, and a hole was opened, flying far away.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Holy light’s face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, retreating rapidly.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Holy light screamed in horror in his heart. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The two moves that he had used almost all his strength on were easily countered by Lu Ming. Moreover, he was injured by the ring.</p><p>Such combat strength was simply terrifying.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and took a step forward. His figure rushed towards the sacred glory like lightning. He looked down from above and swept his spear.</p><p>The Holy Light roared and burst out with all its strength. It almost turned into a man of fire and struck the most powerful blow.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. Under Lu Ming’s spear gleam, all his attacks turned into nothing.</p><p>The huge spear light hit the Holy brilliance directly. The Holy brilliance screamed and flew down.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a primordial Qi ribbon rolled up, wrapping around the Holy brilliance and stopping it from falling.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body fell and his feet stomped on the old face of the sacred glory.</p><p>This kick contained the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Holy light roared.</p><p>However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s foot accurately landed on the sacred glory’s face. The sacred glory’s body was like a meteorite, falling rapidly and heavily on the essential core shield below.</p><p>A deafening explosion, accompanied by a blood-curdling screech and the sound of bones breaking, resounded throughout the entire area.</p><p>Then, everyone saw Sheng Yao lying on the true essence shield like an old dead dog, twitching all over and blood flowing out of his mouth. Especially on his face, there was a clear shoe print, which almost flattened his old face.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Everyone gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Three moves, it really was three moves.</p><p>Including the last kick, it was exactly three moves.</p><p>Three moves. Lu Ming had really suppressed the Holy brilliance in three moves. He had even beaten the Holy brilliance half to death.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>On the high platform, mu Zheng and mu Xiu Yuan were also dumbstruck.</p><p>Although they had hoped that Lu Ming would win, they were not very confident.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the fourth level of the martial King realm half a year ago.</p><p>It was already a miracle for him to become a late-stage King in half a year, let alone a peak-tier King.</p><p>Never in their dreams did they expect that not only did Lu Ming win, but he also won so cleanly and in such an exciting way.</p><p>“This brat, this brat …”</p><p>Mu Zheng kept muttering in a low voice. He was extremely excited.</p><p>How long ago? A year and a half ago, when Lu Ming had just entered the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, he had not even reached the half-step King realm.</p><p>In a short one and a half years, Lu Ming had reached the peak of the king’s realm. It was simply a miracle.</p><p>There had never been such a miracle in the history of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Beside mu Zheng, mu Yi’s mouth was wide open. He was dumbfounded and his face was also filled with disbelief.</p><p>Below the square, Mu Lan looked up at the young figure in the sky with great excitement.</p><p>In her heart, images of the past kept flashing.</p><p>The young man in fiery wind city, the young man who had needed her protection at that time, had walked his own path as time passed.</p><p>Not only had he far surpassed her, but he had also become a top expert in the Tianxuan region. He had become a mountain that could shelter her from the wind and rain, protecting her.</p><p>Half a year ago, when Lu Ming challenged the sacred constellation, Mu Lan knew that he did it for her.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming disappeared for half a year. Half a year later, just as she was about to get married, Lu Ming appeared again. He stood in front of her domineeringly and blocked everything for her.</p><p>At this moment, her eyes were wet.</p><p>She knew that she had made the right choice.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled down and appeared in front of Sheng Xingchen.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>It was still the same sentence.</p><p>Now, did he have the right to stand in front of the Holy star?</p><p>Everyone’s gaze followed Lu Ming’s body as he moved.</p><p>In the Sheng family, the young men who had grudges with Lu Ming and had even fought with him had complicated looks in their eyes.</p><p>There was shock, horror, disbelief, and respect.</p><p>More than half a year ago, Lu Ming was still competing with them. But more than half a year later? Lu Ming had already left them far behind. He was already able to stand in front of the Holy star.</p><p>They were far inferior to Lu Ming. They were no longer on the same level.</p><p>At the thought of this, the heroes of the Sheng family were dejected.</p><p>Many people had previously concluded that Lu Ming had hidden away out of fear. At this moment, they were so ashamed that their faces were red.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide out of fear. He was probably cultivating somewhere.</p><p>On the high platform, mu Tian, Sheng Cang, and Sheng Xingchen’s uncle’s eyes flickered slightly as they sized up Lu Ming seriously.</p><p>Clearly, they had finally acknowledged Lu Ming’s combat strength and were serious about it.</p><p>The sacred constellation had been calm from the beginning, but now, it was as if there were stars shining in his eyes, bright and dazzling.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The sacred constellation spoke.</p><p>“Let’s fight in the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he rose into the air and appeared in the sky.</p><p>The Holy star emitted rays of Starlight and rose into the sky as well. It appeared in the sky, facing Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, many people’s hearts were beating fast. They stared at the two young figures in the sky with wide eyes.</p><p>Was Lu Ming and the sacred constellation finally going to fight?</p><p>Half a year ago, Lu Ming’s challenge to Saint constellation had spread throughout Tianxuan city.</p><p>Some people only laughed it off when they heard it.</p><p>They thought that it was a joke. Even if it was not a joke, it was impossible for Lu Ming to really challenge the sacred constellation. He was too far away and did not have the qualifications at all.</p><p>Even if they were to fight, it would be a one-sided battle. The sacred constellation would probably be able to suppress Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>However, now, no one would think that the Holy constellation could suppress Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>Lu Ming had just used his strength to prove that he was qualified to fight against the sacred constellation.</p><p>Some people even started to worry about the Holy star.</p><p>Half a year ago, the sacred constellation had been at the peak of the ninth level of the martial King realm. At that time, the battle prowess of the sacred constellation was said to be no weaker than that of a peak King.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not weaker than a peak-tier King. He had suppressed a peak-tier King in three moves.</p><p>Had the Holy star broken through to peak King tier? If he had not broken through, would he be a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Everyone was staring at it.</p><p>your combat strength is not bad. Half a year ago, you might have been able to fight me. But now, the result will not change!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as sacred constellation’s voice fell, a huge pillar of Starlight rushed out of sacred constellation’s body, reaching the sky and into the endless void.</p><p>A powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>Peak-tier King!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
