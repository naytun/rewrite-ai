In the battle earlier, the brawny man was the strongest among them. However, a casual punch from Lu Ming was enough to beat the brawny man to a pulp. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>...</p><p>Shura! He’s a Shura! I’ve seen that fist technique before!</p><p>Suddenly, an old man exclaimed and looked at Lu Ming in fear.</p><p>“What? Shura, it’s him?”</p><p>it should be him. He’s so young and has such combat power. It’s very likely that he’s a Shura. He’s just taking off his mask!</p><p>The other peak-tier Kings exclaimed in shock and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>If it was really an Asura, they knew that they could forget about this spirit herb.</p><p>The Shura had single-handedly killed a deep sea Giant snake in the battle with the sea beasts. His combat strength was simply terrifying to the extreme. Killing them would not take much effort.</p><p>“I’m taking this Ziying grass!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across these people and said calmly.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter. Since little brother has taken a fancy to it, you can just take it!”</p><p>The old man said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he strode toward the Ziying grass.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to approach the Ziying grass, a blade of light cut through the void and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and retreated quickly, avoiding the saber gleam.</p><p>A brawny man in his thirties walked over step by step with his hands behind his back. An aura as deep as the ocean emanated from his body.</p><p>Spiritual ocean tier, this was a spiritual ocean tier martial artist.</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the brawny man. He was one of the experts who had rushed over to help. He was also the one who had taken away the corpse of the deep sea Giant snake that Lu Ming had killed.</p><p>“Do you think a mere martial King like you can lay your hands on a level 6 spiritual herb? What a whimsical idea!”</p><p>The brawny man stood high in the sky with his hands behind his back, looking down at Lu Ming and the rest with an arrogant look.</p><p>The dozen peak-tier Kings had ugly expressions.</p><p>“Since senior has taken a liking to it, we naturally don’t dare to compete with senior. We’ll take our leave now!”</p><p>The old man cupped his hands towards Zhang tie respectfully before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The brawny man waved his hand, and a saber-light slashed toward the old man.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically and he hurriedly dodged to the side, barely avoiding the saber ray.</p><p>Of course, this was also because the burly man had held back. Otherwise, with the old man’s cultivation, he would definitely not be able to avoid it.</p><p>“Senior, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>The old man’s face was extremely ugly.</p><p>Although he looked older than the brawny man, in the world of martial Dao, the strong were respected. Cultivation was the only thing that mattered, not age.</p><p>Furthermore, the other party was an Almighty being of the spirit sea. Who knew how old he was on the surface?</p><p>“What do you mean? Hand over your storage rings. I’ve already said that Level 6 spiritual herbs are not for you to take.”</p><p>The burly man said indifferently.</p><p>“What? You want us to hand over our storage rings?”</p><p>The expressions of the peak-tier Kings changed dramatically.</p><p>They were not fools. If they handed over their storage rings, how could they take them back?</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t want to pay? If you don’t hand it over, then you can stay here forever!”</p><p>The brawny man’s face darkened, and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The expressions of the peak-tier Kings changed drastically. All of their belongings were in their storage rings. If they handed them over, how could they cultivate in the future?</p><p>A few people could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions were calm from the beginning to the end.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The burly man shifted his gaze to Lu Ming, then to Xie nianqing. A sinister fire flashed in his eyes.</p><p>kid, you’re pretty calm. Let’s start with you. Hurry up and hand over your storage ring!</p><p>The burly man shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming only replied with one word.</p><p>The strong man was stunned. He stared at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>He suspected that he had heard wrongly. Lu Ming actually told him to get lost? A martial King Ant was telling him to get lost?</p><p>He thought he was hallucinating.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? What did you just say?”</p><p>The burly man could not help but ask twice.</p><p>“I’ll give you three breaths of time to get lost! If you don’t want to leave, then stay here forever!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Hahaha, little brat, you’re telling me to get lost? Are you crazy?”</p><p>The burly man laughed madly as if he had never encountered such a funny thing in his life.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Lu Ming started to count coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, you know? However, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The brawny man emitted a strong killing intent.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>The brawny man’s face darkened completely. He realized that Lu Ming did not seem to be joking at all. He was serious. However, what right did a young kid in his twenties, a warrior at the peak of the martial King realm, have to ask him, a sea of soul realm expert, to get lost? what was his confidence?</p><p>The dozen peak-tier Kings were also dumbfounded.</p><p>Even though they had guessed that Lu Ming might be an Asura, they felt as if they were dreaming when they saw a peak-tier King threatening a sea of soul realm expert.</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Lu Ming counted to one.</p><p>In a flash, Xie nianqing appeared behind the brawny man, one in front and one behind Lu Ming, blocking his way out.</p><p>“You two little brats, I’d like to see what kind of ability you have to be so arrogant in front of me. Today, I’ll make you face a life and death dilemma!”</p><p>The burly man revealed a ferocious expression and his killing intent became even stronger.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he suddenly threw a punch.</p><p>This punch almost pierced through the space and let out a deafening roar.</p><p>The brawny man’s expression changed. He realized that this punch could pose a threat to him.</p><p>A saber appeared in his hand. Just as he was about to swing the saber to disperse Lu Ming’s fist radiance, his body suddenly sank as if a ten-thousand-foot mountain was pressing on him. He almost fell to the ground.</p><p>Behind them, Xie nianqing used the sky demon force field.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The brawny man found that his body was as heavy as a mountain. Not only did his movements slow down, but even the circulation of his true essence in his body slowed down. It was as if every muscle on his body was pressed down by a mountain.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw hundreds of punches. Hundreds of terrifying fist gleams were aimed at the burly man.</p><p>That aura was too terrifying.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered as the power of destruction suddenly erupted.</p><p>The burly man’s body trembled violently. The destructive cutting force almost cut him into two. Lu Ming’s exploding star fist had already arrived.</p><p>“No, no, spare my life!”</p><p>At this moment, the brawny man was afraid. He was truly afraid.</p><p>With his cultivation at the mid-stage of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm, it was almost impossible for him to resist the joint attack of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>He could feel death approaching.</p><p>However, before he could finish his sentence, hundreds of fist radiance drowned him.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw over a hundred punches, followed by another hundred punches. Another hundred fist gleams headed for the burly man.</p><p>That area was completely submerged by the intense light, and only the sound of explosions could be heard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
