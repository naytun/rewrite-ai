In the wooden house, there was a young man and a young woman who were not even twenty years old, and an infant.</p><p>...</p><p>The black-robed man waved his hand, and two streams of Zhen Yuan poured into the bodies of the young man and woman, causing them to fall unconscious. Then, the three black-robed men carved runes on their hands and inserted them into the baby’s body. A blood-red gas was slowly extracted from the baby’s heart.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with cold murderous intent.</p><p>Although he had heard about it, he still could not control the murderous intent in his heart when he saw it with his own eyes.</p><p>Extracting the connate Qi of infants to refine pills was a brutal method that took away one’s life.</p><p>“Ta!” …</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide his aura anymore. He strode into the wooden house.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The three black-robed men immediately noticed someone and shouted.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the wooden house with a cold look in his eyes. Xie nianqing followed suit.</p><p>“It’s the two of you. Haha, since you’ve discovered this, I can only send you on your way. I originally wanted to let you live for a few more days.”</p><p>One of the black-robed men sneered.</p><p>“Yun congsheng!” Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>No wonder he felt that this person’s voice was familiar. At this moment, he guessed that it was Yun congsheng.</p><p>“Hehe, that’s me!”</p><p>The black-robed man took off the hood on his head, revealing a face full of killing intent. It was Yun congsheng.</p><p>Yun congsheng’s fiery eyes fell on Xie nianqing and he sneered, ” “B * tch, you actually dared to reject me in public. Do you know that it’s your fortune that this young master has taken a fancy to you? Today, I’ll cripple your cultivation first, and then let you enjoy it, hehe!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave this guy to me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p>“Of course you can!” Lu Ming had already mourned for Yun congsheng in his heart.</p><p>“Attack! Just cripple their cultivation, I want them alive!”</p><p>Yun congsheng waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing retreated from the wooden house and flew into the sky.</p><p>“You want to leave? Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Yun congsheng and the other two chased after him and reached a high altitude.</p><p>“Leave? who wants to leave? It’s just that it’s more convenient here!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Do it. I’ll leave this kid to you. I’ll personally serve that b * tch!”</p><p>Yun congsheng sneered and released a powerful aura.</p><p>He was at the peak of Lv 8 martial King realm.</p><p>Yun congsheng had actually reached the peak of Lv 8 martial King realm. No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The other two black-robed men’s auras also burst out. They were also at the early stage of the LV 8 martial King realm. Both of them pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Before the two black-robed men could reach him, their throats were pierced by the two spear lights, and they even let out a scream.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flashed past and devoured their blood essence. The storage ring was also in his hands.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Yun congsheng’s eyes suddenly widened as he looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming’s cultivation level only slightly higher than Gu Huaxu’s? How did he suddenly become so strong? two Lv 8 martial King realm experts were killed before they could even react.</p><p>Hiding his abilities. Lu Ming must have hidden his abilities earlier.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Yun congsheng turned around and ran.</p><p>To be able to kill two Lv 8 martial King realm experts so easily, her combat strength was definitely above his.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned cold. He raised one of his Jade-like hands and pressed it in the air.</p><p>An invisible force field was created, and Yun congsheng’s body was frozen in the air, unable to move at all.</p><p>“What a wondrous martial technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He had already experienced this martial arts technique before. It was indeed extremely powerful.</p><p>He had asked Xie nianqing about it and learned that it was called the sky demon force field. However, Xie nianqing had only just started learning about it. She had come to the cloud Sea alchemy institution to obtain the sky demon fruit to cultivate the sky demon force field.</p><p>With the heavenly demonic fruit, her heavenly demonic power field could be upgraded to a higher level.</p><p>Yun congsheng was extremely frightened and tried his best to stab the needle. However, with his cultivation, he couldn’t break free from the restraint of the sky demon power field.</p><p>“Let me go, let me go, what do you want? My father is the head of the Yun family, a sea of soul realm expert. If you dare to kill me, my father will not let you off.”</p><p>Yun congsheng shouted in fear.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait for me here!” He said.</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hand and flew away with Yun congsheng. Not long after, Yun congsheng’s shrill screams could be heard. Lu Ming couldn’t bear to hear them.</p><p>“This … It seems that it’s better to not offend women in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel his back sweating profusely.</p><p>After a moment, the screams stopped and Xie nianqing flew back alone.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Dead?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and flew forward. Lu Ming caught up and said, ” Yun Cong’s death will probably cause a commotion in the cloud Sea alchemy institution. We’d better keep a low profile!</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. With their current battle power, it would be very difficult for them to fight against sea of soul realm experts.</p><p>The spirit sea realm was much stronger than the martial King realm.</p><p>An ordinary peak-tier King, an expert at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, could kill a group of them with a single slap.</p><p>The two of them returned to the cloud Sea alchemy institution without anyone noticing.</p><p>……</p><p>In a mountain range hundreds of thousands of miles away from the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy, Gu Huaxu sat cross-legged on a mountain peak.</p><p>“Damn it, that brat, if I don’t kill him, I’m not a human!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared in a low voice, his face filled with hatred.</p><p>“Hehe, kid, you want to take revenge? stop dreaming. If I’m not wrong, Lu Ming didn’t use his full strength when he fought you. You can even say that he only used a little strength!”</p><p>Suddenly, a dry and unpleasant voice sounded.</p><p>This voice was extremely sudden, but there was clearly only Gu Huaxu here.</p><p>Gu Huaxu didn’t seem surprised at all, he just frowned and roared, ” “Are you saying that Lu Ming did not use his full strength? You should die!”</p><p>hehe, that’s right. If I’m not wrong, that Lu Ming definitely has the combat strength of a peak-tier King. And that young lady gives off a very dangerous feeling. She’s probably not weaker than that kid, or even stronger!</p><p>The shriveled voice sounded again.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen? Then wouldn’t I be unable to take revenge? Detestable!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared.</p><p>“That’s not for sure. You should have prepared the things I told you to prepare, right? As long as you do as I say, I can guarantee that your cultivation will skyrocket in a short time. It’ll be more than enough to defeat the man and woman.”</p><p>The shriveled voice said.</p><p>I’ve prepared everything, but I can really defeat Lu Ming in a short time. You said just now that he has the combat strength not weaker than a peak-tier King.</p><p>Gu Huaxu was in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
