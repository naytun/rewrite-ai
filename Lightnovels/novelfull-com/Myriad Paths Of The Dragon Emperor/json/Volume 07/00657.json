How did this happen?”</p><p>Chen Zhao kept roaring in his heart. He couldn’t bear it.</p><p>Previously, he kept talking about how powerful and terrifying his big brother was in front of Lu Ming. Lu Ming was nothing in front of his big brother.</p><p>He was very proud and arrogant.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Previously, his big brother had been defeated by Xue gang and had almost been killed. He had fled in embarrassment and had only managed to save his life with five million Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>However, Xue gang, who was torturing his big brother, had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>What was this? Every word he had said before was a joke, a blatant joke.</p><p>Perhaps, in Lu Ming’s eyes, he was just a clown telling some ridiculous jokes.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Chen Zhao roared in his heart. His self-esteem had suffered a serious blow.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked loudly.</p><p>No one made a sound, and no one went up the stage.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for a few minutes but no one went on stage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong today. Even if there were people stronger than Xue gang, they would consider it and not attack easily.</p><p>After a few minutes, no one made a move. Lu Ming flew down the fighting ring and came to Xie nianqing’s side.</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said lightly as he flew up to the fighting ring. His aura spread out.</p><p>peak-tier King! Another peak-tier King! And he’s wearing a Yaksha mask! Could he be another expert? ”</p><p>“That’s impossible. How can there be so many experts?”</p><p>“Looking at the figure, it seems to be a woman.”</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing went up, there was a lot of discussion.</p><p>“Who’s going to fight?”</p><p>Xie nianqing spoke. His voice was clear but cold.</p><p>“It’s miss Xie!”</p><p>Luo Xin immediately recognized Xie nianqing’s voice.</p><p>“Could it be that miss Xie’s combat strength is also very strong?” Luo Xin whispered.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Chen Zhao snorted coldly, his eyes flashing with viciousness. He secretly prayed that Xie nianqing would be killed.</p><p>“It’s a young woman!”</p><p>The audience around them could tell that Xie nianqing was young.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>Finally, someone went on stage.</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, Xie nianqing launched his attack.</p><p>Xie nianqing did not use the demonic force field or her bloodline martial arts technique. She mainly used the will of destruction and the will of wind. She wanted to use Lu Ming’s method to merge the two wills with the help of external forces.</p><p>Therefore, Xie nianqing didn’t seem to be very strong, and he was in a stalemate with his opponent.</p><p>Lu Ming diverted some of his attention to watch the battle while refining the blood essence.</p><p>After devouring the blood essence of four peak-tier Kings, he used it all to improve his second bloodline. The power of his second bloodline rapidly increased.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Xie nianqing exchanged hundreds of moves with his opponent before he finally killed him.</p><p>Because Xie nianqing’s combat strength wasn’t very strong, and after a few hundred moves, the others thought that they had an advantage. Unfortunately, the result was the same. After another few hundred moves, he was still killed.</p><p>After that, no one else went on stage.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s blood essence was almost refined.</p><p>His second bloodline had not been upgraded yet, but Lu Ming felt that it would be soon. It was close.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing jumped down from the ring and left the ring with Lu Ming.</p><p>After a few battles, they needed to go back and digest it.</p><p>But soon, the names of Shura and Yaksha would spread all over golden sand island.</p><p>The two of them left the life battle platform and found a hidden place. They removed their black robes and masks, then found an Inn and booked two rooms.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the room of the inn. With a thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>After four battles, Lu Ming had a new understanding of the explosive star fist. He wanted to use the path-understanding ancient tree to gain some insight.</p><p>He placed the path-understanding ancient tree on the side.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was growing better and better. The tender Leaf had grown a little more, turned a little green, and was crystal clear. The aura of the great path lingered on it, becoming more and more mysterious.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming took out a large handful of spiritual herbs, squeezed out the medicinal liquid, and sprinkled it all on the xuanhuang silicotic earth.</p><p>“Leave some for me!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes turned red with heartache when she saw Lu Ming turning a large pile of spirit herbs into liquid.</p><p>“I’ll give you a few!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few spiritual herbs to dandan, but he sighed in his heart.</p><p>He was too good at using up resources.</p><p>His own cultivation consumed a terrifying amount of resources, ten times more than others.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultivation of the ten thousand spiritual combat body required a lot of resources.</p><p>The growth of the path-understanding ancient tree required a large amount of spiritual liquid. If there was no spiritual liquid, he could only replace it with medicinal liquid.</p><p>Also, if dandan wanted to recover, she couldn’t do without spirit herbs.</p><p>The speed at which he consumed resources was too terrifying. Ordinary people would definitely not be able to withstand it.</p><p>It was only because he had killed many enemies during this period of time and obtained a large amount of resources that he could barely bear it.</p><p>However, as long as these resources could be converted into strength, it was worth it.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and cast the distracting thoughts out of his mind. With the help of the path-understanding ancient tree, he began to comprehend the bursting star fist.</p><p>During this time, he didn’t have a chance to use the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Using the path-understanding ancient tree, his comprehension of the explosive star fist had increased by a large margin.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing went to the life battle platform again.</p><p>This was a great place, and they didn’t want to miss it.</p><p>It was a pity that no one challenged Lu Ming today. In a fit of anger, he announced on the spot that he would come every day to wait for the challenge of an expert.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, someone who challenged her was not weak, but he was killed by Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Your method is not bad. I’ll go into seclusion for a few days!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Lu Ming. He seemed to have gained something.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the inn and continued to cultivate with the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>The next day, he went to the life battle platform again.</p><p>Still, no one challenged him.</p><p>For the next three days, Lu Ming went to the life battle platform every day, but no one challenged him. After he returned, he went to the Supreme shrine to cultivate.</p><p>For the past five days, no one had challenged Lu Ming.</p><p>However, with the help of the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the explosive star fist had progressed very quickly. He had already cultivated it to the fourth level, and the power of the explosive star fist had increased again.</p><p>On the sixth day, someone finally challenged Lu Ming.</p><p>This person’s combat strength was much stronger than Gang Xue’s, and he had won ten consecutive victories on the life battle platform.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s daily visits had attracted the attention of some experts. Some of them had come to challenge him.</p><p>Of course, the final result was still Lu Ming’s victory.</p><p>The name of Asura was becoming more and more powerful.</p><p>Although the Asura had only won five consecutive victories, he had already defeated ten opponents in a row. Moreover, no one knew what Lu Ming’s limit was.</p><p>do you guys think that the King of Hell will make a move and challenge the Shura? ”</p><p>Some people hoped so.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
