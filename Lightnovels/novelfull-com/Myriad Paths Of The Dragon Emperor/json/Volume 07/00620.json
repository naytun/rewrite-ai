He began to think of various ways to inscribe level one inscriptions.</p><p>In his mind, there were more than three million ways to inscribe level one inscriptions given to him by dandan.</p><p>Every one of them was different. Inscriptions were like traces of nature, extremely mysterious.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes. The mental energy fire circulated between his fingers and he began to inscribe in the void.</p><p>As his fingertip swept across, a mysterious pattern appeared in the void. On it, there was a burning aura.</p><p>This was a level 1 inscription, inscription of heat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The runes of heat flew out and were engraved on the wall.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his finger and another inscription appeared in the void. This time, it was filled with a cold aura.</p><p>This was a level one inscription, the inscription of cold.</p><p>With a flick of his finger, the cold rune flew out and was engraved on the wall.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his mental energy fire circulated. His fingers kept moving in the air and runes flew out continuously, shining with all kinds of brilliance.</p><p>WOWO, success, it’s still a success. It’s a complete success. How abnormal!</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan’s turtle eyes were wide open, looking dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming had lit ten spirit lamps in the first stage. It was definitely easy for him to inscribe level one inscriptions. It knew this in its heart.</p><p>However, it was Lu Ming’s first time inscribing an inscription. Not only was his speed terrifyingly fast, but he also had a 100% success rate. This was too abnormal. From what he knew, even if he lit ten spirit lamps, it should not be so abnormal.</p><p>“Could it be that this guy is a genius in inscription?”</p><p>Dandan thought in her heart.</p><p>“Hahaha, awesome, awesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He had a feeling that he was completely in control. He felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>As he waved his fingers, the speed of inscribing became faster and faster. In the end, only an illusion could be seen waving and moving in the air.</p><p>A series of runes that were shimmering with light flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after half an hour.</p><p>“Brat, you seem to be very proud. Let me tell you, what are you proud of now? you are still far from it!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s smug and carefree expression, dandan was unhappy and deliberately attacked him.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“I’m telling you, the inscription you just inscribed is only a single level one inscription. If you want to refine weapons, refine pills, or even inscribe inscription arrays, you need to combine many kinds of inscriptions. Countless level one inscriptions need to be combined, even low level and high level inscriptions need to be combined. It is countless times more complicated than inscribing a single inscription. Boy, you still have a lot to learn!”</p><p>also, do you think that your inscription speed is very fast? let me tell you, many true inscription blacksmiths can inscribe inscriptions in an instant. They can inscribe inscriptions with a raise of their hands. They are many times faster than you!</p><p>Dandan spared no effort to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>not bad, I’m still far from it. When I have time, I need to practice more!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was rare for him to say something like that. No, it was turtle language.</p><p>Dandan placed her hands behind her back and nodded, looking like a promising child. However, deep down, she was still shocked by Lu Ming’s earlier actions.</p><p>What it said was something that others had to slowly master through countless efforts. Who could master it overnight?</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was already extremely shocking.</p><p>kid, try the meditation now and you’ll know how amazing it is!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to try it out.</p><p>He closed his eyes and activated the meditation of the underworld.</p><p>For a long time, Lu Ming felt as if he was on a mental journey, floating in the endless universe.</p><p>Suddenly, a large river appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was unknown how wide and how long this River was. It was extremely vast and filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that this Big River had a strong attraction to him, attracting him to approach it.</p><p>Lu Ming slowly flew over and into the river.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that he had turned into a ball of fire, a ball of earth core flowing flame.</p><p>The river was filled with endless mental fire, which was also the fire of inscription.</p><p>Endless. The spirit Fire of this River was endless. It was the color of chaos. Endless.</p><p>The geocentric flowing flame that Lu Ming had transformed into floated in the air. All around him, wisps of mental energy fire gathered toward the geocentric flowing flame. At this moment, Lu Ming had a clear feeling that his mental energy fire was slowly growing stronger.</p><p>“This … It’s so wonderful!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. A moment later, he had an idea and the river disappeared. The underground cave was still in front of him.</p><p>amazing, I can feel that the yellow mind fire in my sixth mind lamp is more robust!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Kid, did you see a huge River?”</p><p>Dandan asked.</p><p>“That’s right. What’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously. He realized that he knew too little. He did not understand this world at all.</p><p>there are many laws in the world, which represent the heavenly Dao. The river you see is the law of inscription, a supreme law with endless power of inscription. If you run the meditation, you can successfully communicate with the law of inscription and obtain the power of inscription to strengthen your spiritual fire!</p><p>your fire seed is the core flowing flame. With the addition of the underworld God visualization, I estimate that I’ll absorb quite a lot of inscription power. In the future, you can use this to cultivate and improve your mental fire!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“Oh? I seem to have heard that this isn’t how most inscription Masters raise their mental fire.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Nonsense, of course not.”</p><p>“There are usually two ways for an inscriber to improve their mental fire,” dandan pouted.</p><p>the first is through weapon refinement, pill refinement, inscription formation, etc., Constant practice and constant use of the mental fire. This is equivalent to tempering the mental fire. The more it is tempered, the more the mental fire can be improved. However, the speed of improvement is extremely slow. Most of the inscription Masters you’ve seen use this method to improve.</p><p>there’s another way, which is through refining weapons and elixirs. Those are refining weapons and elixirs beyond one’s level. For example, if a level one inscriber refines a level two Spirit weapon, the law of inscription will drop the power of inscription and increase his mental energy. Of course, if he refines a high quality spirit weapon or elixir of the same level, such as Supreme-grade or peerless-grade spirit weapons, the law of inscription will also drop the power of inscription.</p><p>“It can be done like this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>of course, there’s another way, and that’s the mental fire cultivation method. It can directly communicate with the inscription laws and absorb the power of the inscription. This way, the speed will be countless times faster. However, mental fire cultivation methods are too rare. Any low-level mental fire cultivation method will cause a frenzy when it’s introduced. A low-level mental fire cultivation method can create a powerful inscription force.</p><p>as for the underworld God visualization, it’s the top cultivation method of mind fire. Now, you know how precious it is!</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly amazed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
