How terrifying was that? how many treasures would he have in his closed-door cultivation?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart palpitated.</p><p>let’s go, brat. I’ve already felt the treasure calling. Let’s go!</p><p>Dandan cried out, her eyes wide open and sparkling with a crystal-like luster.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not stop and continued to move forward. After a few hundred miles, their speed gradually slowed down.</p><p>Although the palace was clearer from here, the inscription arrays here were getting more and more dense. If he was not careful, he would step into the inscription array.</p><p>Along the way, they saw many more corpses.</p><p>It was even more dangerous if they continued forward, as there were formations everywhere.</p><p>“It’s fine. With me here, what’s a mere seventh-rank inscription master’s inscription formation to me? Just you guys wait!”</p><p>Dandan leaped down from Lu Ming’s shoulder, spread out her short legs and sprinted wildly in the air. She looked left and right, sometimes deep in thought, sometimes looking at the mountains and rivers.</p><p>After a while, dandan flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder and said, ” fly three miles to the right and land on that mound. After that, fly five miles forward and continue …</p><p>Dandan began to give pointers.</p><p>hey, dandan, is it reliable? this is a human life!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan with some worry.</p><p>“Nonsense, Who am I? The head of the top ten warbeasts, who had read through thousands of great arrays. What was this great array? If this Lord wasn’t injured, this child’s play would be broken with a wave of my hand!”</p><p>Dandan said with a smug face.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He did not really believe dandan. This guy often dropped the ball at critical moments.</p><p>However, he was only a third-rank Alchemist, and the inscriptions he had mastered were only at the third-rank. His study of the inscription formation was not mature enough. He could not see through the formation that was set up by a seventh-rank Alchemist master.</p><p>“I can only trust this guy now.”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and followed Xie nianqing’s instructions. They flew three miles to the right and then five miles forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than ten minutes later, an ordinary-looking small mountain peak suddenly flashed with runes. A few dazzling sword gleams condensed and slashed toward Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>nest, you’ve misjudged. Run!</p><p>Dandan shouted and ran away, faster than anyone else.</p><p>“.. ck me …”</p><p>Lu Ming was cursing in his heart. He swept his spear across and retreated quickly. Xie nianqing also cast the sky demon force field to block the sword radiance.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field was split in half almost instantly.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as the Spear’s radiance expanded and swept toward the three sword beams. At the same time, he pulled Xie nianqing’s hand and retreated frantically.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a few loud bangs, the spear ray exploded. Lu Ming was forced to retreat several miles by a huge force before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>Lu Ming felt the qi and blood in his body churning and he almost vomited blood. His eyes were burning with fire as he looked at dandan and gritted his teeth. this is the level of the top ten warbeasts? are you trying to kill us? ”</p><p>cough, cough. Lu Ming, calm down. Don’t get too excited. I made a mistake and misjudged you. It won’t happen next time. It definitely won’t!</p><p>Dandan also felt a little embarrassed and coughed a few times.</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless. This guy was really unreliable. However, he was the only one who could be relied on.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly swore that he must increase his inscription level as soon as possible. Otherwise, it would be too dangerous to keep relying on this thing.</p><p>Dandan ran to the front again and observed carefully.</p><p>After a while, he ran back and said with confidence, ” don’t worry. There won’t be any mistakes this time. Go ahead boldly!</p><p>“I’d be a fool to believe you!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. This time, he and Xie nianqing were even more careful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A small lake suddenly stirred up, and a blade light burst out.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing turned and ran. This time, they were much more careful. If anything went wrong, they would turn and run. They were safe.</p><p>“You old turtle, are you trying to trick me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was furious.</p><p>cough, cough, my mistake, my mistake. Young man, calm down, calm down. It’s not good to get angry at such a young age. Look at that girl, how calm is she? ” Dandan said awkwardly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want to braise this little turtle!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>Dandan’s whole body trembled and she ran forward, ” “I’ll observe for a while more. There’s no mistake this time!”</p><p>Just like that, he stumbled forward.</p><p>The further they went, the closer they were to the palace, but the more inscription formations they saw.</p><p>There were two figures hundreds of miles ahead of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>One of them was Yun Luo, the old ancestor of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy.</p><p>The other was a middle-aged man who was only a peak-tier King.</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man’s face was pale as he said, ” senior, it’s too dangerous up ahead. If you let me Scout the way, only death will await us!</p><p>Oh, if you don’t go and Scout, you’ll die now. It’s your choice!</p><p>Yun Luo said coldly.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face turned even paler.</p><p>He originally had three companions, but they were captured and scouted the way for him. The other three companions had all died because they scouted the way. Now, it was his turn.</p><p>“Still not moving forward? If you go and explore the path, you still have a chance of survival. We’ll soon reach the palace, and perhaps after passing through this section, there will be no more danger. You may still be able to live, but if you don’t act, I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Yun Luo’s voice was cold.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression changed. In the end, he gritted his teeth and flew forward carefully.</p><p>The formation here was extremely wondrous. One would only be safe if they advanced through the gaps. Otherwise, even if they flew past, they could trigger the formation.</p><p>Furthermore, there was even a formation in the air. The means of a rank 7 true inscription Alchemist were already unfathomable.</p><p>The middle-aged man focused his mind and walked left and right for more than ten miles without any trouble.</p><p>Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, inscriptions glowed in the air and a battle sword formed, cutting the burly man in half.</p><p>“Damn it, useless trash!”</p><p>Yun Luo growled. Now that the last person to Scout the way for him was dead, how was he supposed to enter?</p><p>Even if his cultivation was strong and he could break through some formations directly, there were some formations that even he could be killed by. He didn’t dare to take the risk.</p><p>Just as he was hesitating, a few figures were coming over and appeared behind him.</p><p>Yun Luo turned around, and after seeing the person clearly, his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>They were Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>When Yun Luo saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, they naturally saw her as well.</p><p>“Yun Luo, it’s you, you old man?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. It was beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had not seen Yun Luo’s figure in the battle with the sea beasts before, but now, he saw Yun Luo here.</p><p>This guy had hidden in the middle of a great battle. When there were benefits, he had appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
