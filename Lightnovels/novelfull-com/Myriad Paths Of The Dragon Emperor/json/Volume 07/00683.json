He had also been injured in the formation, but the severity of his injuries was unknown. If he had retained his combat strength, which was similar to or even stronger than the spiritual practitioner with the frost saber, they would be in trouble.</p><p>...</p><p>But today, it was impossible to kill the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao and the Crimson old monster closed in on Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>In the surroundings, everyone was watching with rapt attention. They were all extremely curious in their hearts. Would the three geniuses who were like the sun at midday die at the hands of two old monsters?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a Golden Pagoda appeared on King Yama’s body. The Golden Pagoda emitted a dazzling golden light that was even more dazzling than the sun.</p><p>The rays of golden light seemed to be extremely sharp sword Qi.</p><p>golden light sword Pagoda!</p><p>The spiritual warrior han Dao and the Crimson old monster couldn’t help but exclaim when they saw the Golden Pagoda.</p><p>“It’s the golden light sword Pagoda!”</p><p>Around him, the others also exclaimed in shock.</p><p>“You’re from the gold sword sect?”</p><p>The red-haired old monster said with a serious expression.</p><p>To the West of the chaotic Astral Ocean, there is a large domain called the golden light domain. In the eastern wastelands, the golden light domain is extremely famous. It’s not a small domain, but rather a large domain with extremely terrifying strength.</p><p>The number one sect in the golden light region was the golden sword sect.</p><p>Although the golden light region was also under the control of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, and the golden sword sect was also a subordinate force of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, the golden sword sect’s authority in the golden light region was extremely great. It was almost on the same level as the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s branch Palace in the golden light region. From this, one could see how powerful the golden sword sect was.</p><p>As for the golden light sword Pagoda, it was owned only by the true geniuses of the golden sword sect. It was extremely famous and had exposed the fact that the starry sea was close to the golden light region, so it was natural that he had heard of it.</p><p>“I’m Jian feiliu!”</p><p>The King of Hell slowly reported his name.</p><p>“What? You’re Jian feiliu from the golden sword sect, the 788th on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory!”</p><p>As soon as King Yama finished speaking, the red-haired old monster and the spiritual practitioner han Dao’s expressions changed.</p><p>A series of exclamations rang out in the surroundings.</p><p>Hell King was Jian feiliu, who was ranked 788th on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s gazes flickered as well.</p><p>They had heard of Jian feiliu, who was on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>He was ranked 788th, much stronger than Li Xiaoyun.</p><p>“Old ghost cold saber, let’s just forget about today’s matter!”</p><p>The red-haired old monster’s expression changed as he spoke to the spiritual practitioner han Dao.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of Jian feiliu, but he was afraid of the gold sword sect behind Jian feiliu.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? If we kill them today and find a small island to hide on, will the metal sword sect be able to find us?”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao revealed a vicious look and said, ” moreover, these kids all have precious treasures. We’ll split them evenly. Reddie, don’t be so gutless!</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao’s eyes were cold.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing entered the hall. When they went in to take a look, it was empty. Even the flood Dragon was gone. He speculated that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing must have obtained the treasure inside.</p><p>Moreover, his hatred for Lu Ming was too strong. He would not be satisfied if he did not kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Jian feiliu had gotten the treasure from The Other Palace, so he didn’t want to let them go.</p><p>The red-haired old monster’s expression also changed. He was also very tempted by the treasure that could catch the attention of the spiritual practitioner.</p><p>“Han Bing, if you want to kill us, let’s see if you have the ability. You think I don’t have life-saving items on me when I’m out adventuring? from another perspective, if I control the golden sword Pagoda with all my might, do you think you can stop me? I’m confident that I can kill one of you. Which one of you is here to die?”</p><p>Jian feiliu sneered as he looked at the ice Spirit Warrior and the red monster.</p><p>The ice Spirit Warrior and the red monster’s faces turned ugly. They knew that Jian feiliu was right.</p><p>Would a heaven’s favorite like Jian feiliu not have any life-saving items? The golden sword Pagoda was also a famous treasure. With Jian feiliu’s cultivation, it was difficult to control it. However, if he was forced to fight to the death, one of them might be killed.</p><p>“Brother Jian, there’s no need to waste words with them. I also have something on me. If I use it with all my might, it’ll be enough to kill one of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>This caused the expressions of the icy spiritual being and the red monster to change again, and they could not help but retreat a distance.</p><p>They had no choice but to believe that Lu Ming was telling the truth. Lu Ming was so young and his combat strength was not inferior to Jian feiliu’S. He was definitely from a major force. It was very possible that he had a treasure on him to protect himself.</p><p>Moreover, there was still Xie nianqing.</p><p>They began to hesitate.</p><p>This was the advantage of being a powerful force. It was not something that these itinerant cultivators could compare to.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the spiritual practitioner han Dao and the Crimson old monster coldly. What he said just now was half true and half false.</p><p>He did have a killer move, which was the Thunder cauldron. However, if he used the Thunder cauldron, he would be at the mercy of others. In such an environment, Lu Ming did not intend to use the Thunder cauldron at all. He only said it to scare the cold saber spiritual practitioner and the Crimson old monster.</p><p>“In my opinion, let’s just forget about today’s matter!”</p><p>After pondering for a while, the red-haired old monster spoke. Obviously, he didn’t dare to gamble with his life.</p><p>Spiritual practitioner han Dao’s expression was unsightly and he was very unwilling. However, since the Crimson old monster had retreated, he could not do anything to Lu Ming and the others. If he was not careful, he might even be killed by them.</p><p>“You little B * stards, just wait until I recover from my injuries and see how I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao roared in his heart.</p><p>If he was in his Prime, he was absolutely confident that he could kill Lu Ming and Jian feiliu before they could use their secret treasures.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The spiritual practitioner han Dao glanced at Lu Ming and the others. He and the Crimson old monster turned into two streaks of light and flew into the distance, disappearing from this place.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the seven-colored Island had completely disappeared into the void. The void had returned to its calm state.</p><p>how should I address you? I really admire your cultivation and battle strength!</p><p>Jian feiliu kept the golden sword Pagoda and cupped his fists at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists and smiled.</p><p>“Xie nianqing!” Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Xie nianqing?”</p><p>Jian feiliu thought for a while. Apparently, he had never heard of these two people.</p><p>Then he smiled bitterly and said, ” I’ve heard that many geniuses and proud sons of heaven have emerged in this Golden Age. It seems it’s true. I’ve met geniuses who are on the same level as those on the list of top 1000 talents along the way. There are more than five of them now. No wonder the secret Chamber of Commerce didn’t release a new list when it was time for the list to be updated. I guess there are too many new geniuses, and it’s hard for the Chamber of Commerce to control all of them.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was puzzled too. The list of top 1000 talents would be updated once every two years. According to the time, the two years should have passed. However, the new list of top 1000 talents had not been updated. It was obviously related to the current era.</p><p>The great era was coming, and the geniuses were rising. Although the secret Chamber of Commerce was powerful, it was difficult to control all of them.</p><p>If he wanted to know how many geniuses there were, he could only wait until the battle of Providence began.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
