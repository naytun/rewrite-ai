He could not be bothered to say anything to such a person.</p><p>...</p><p>“Kid, kneel down and admit your mistake. Then destroy your cultivation and get out of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy. If you do that, I can spare your life!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu said coldly.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?” Gu Huaxu’s face turned dark.</p><p>“I said, idiot, get lost! Good dogs don’t block the way.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Little bastard, you’re looking for death. How dare you talk to young master Gu like that? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>At the edge of the ancient flower void, a young man rushed out. He pointed his fingers like a sword and shot out beams of sword Qi at Lu Ming’s major acupuncture points.</p><p>This young man had the cultivation of a Lv 5 martial King. If he was stabbed, Lu Ming’s cultivation would be crippled.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>However, before his sword aura could even get close to Lu Ming, he was kicked away by Lu Ming.</p><p>After flying for a few hundred meters, he crashed into a mound and dust filled the air.</p><p>At this moment, some people in the surroundings were alarmed and stopped to watch from a distance.</p><p>that Lu Ming seems to be quite powerful. He’s just a fifth level lower tier King and he was sent flying with one move.</p><p>I’ve never heard of him before. Could he be a genius from another region? ”</p><p>In the surroundings, some people were whispering to each other.</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s face turned even colder, ” “So you have some ability. However, this bit of ability is nothing in front of me. Die!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu’s figure moved and he struck a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm struck and the air rumbled with a Sonic Boom. The force of the palm was like an avalanche, surging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>A King tier at the peak of the 7th level of the martial King realm. This was Gu Huaxu’s strength.</p><p>At this age, to be able to reach this stage was already very good.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had met Lu Ming.</p><p>A long spear appeared in his hand and he swept it out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear collided with Gu Huaxu’s palm, and Gu Huaxu’s body retreated rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wei Ran did not move.</p><p>Of course, this was the result of Lu Ming holding back his power. Otherwise, Gu Huaxu would have been blown up by the spear.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to reveal too much of his power and attract the attention of the cloud Sea alchemy institution. Otherwise, it would be more difficult to obtain the heavenly demon fruit and the other party would definitely be more vigilant.</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed his strength to be slightly stronger than Gu Huaxu.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>Gu Huaxu roared in anger and charged at Lu Ming again. His palm turned red and gold. One palm print after another landed on Lu Ming. The violent palm force shook the space.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear vibrated and shot out rays of spear radiance that clashed with Gu Huaxu’s palm force.</p><p>With every spear radiance, Gu Huaxu’s palm print crumbled. Lu Ming strode forward and closed in on him.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming shouted and whipped his spear at Gu Huaxu, sending him flying.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Gu Huaxu struggled to get up and spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale as he glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>“Kid, just you wait!”</p><p>After saying that, Gu Huaxu ran away.</p><p>this Lu Ming is so strong. Not only is his alchemy technique brilliant, but his cultivation level is also very strong!</p><p>he’s a pretty good genius to have reached the late stages of the king tier at such a young age. Let’s try not to provoke him in the future!</p><p>The rest of the people looked at Lu Ming with fear and left one after another.</p><p>“I thought you would kill him in one move!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“It’s easy to kill him, I’m just afraid of alerting the enemy.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and the two of them returned to the dormitory.</p><p>As night fell, two figures were discussing something in a luxurious courtyard of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy.</p><p>This was Begonia courtyard.</p><p>These two people were Yun Haitang and Yun congsheng.</p><p>hehe, that Gu Huaxu actually made a move. That saved us a lot of trouble. I was planning to send someone to test Lu Ming’s strength.</p><p>Yun Haitang picked up a cup of red wine, took a sip, and smiled.</p><p>/Lv 7 King warrior is not bad, but he’s not a threat to us. That b/tch Xie nianqing actually dared to reject me in public. Damn it/she’s just/b/tch/She’s just putting on an act. I’ll make her beg for mercy in my bed one day!</p><p>Yun congsheng said coldly. His voice was ice-cold and his eyes were filled with lust.</p><p>don’t touch that woman for now. At least, don’t touch her before I get my hands on her. Otherwise, what if my prey is scared away? ”</p><p>I feel that Lu Ming’s mental energy fire is extraordinary. It must be delicious!</p><p>As she spoke, Yun Haitang stuck out her tongue and licked her lips. Her eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>This action was extremely provocative. Yun congsheng swallowed a mouthful of saliva as he watched. His eyes were burning and his abdomen was burning.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Want to come? I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>Yun Haitang licked her lips and looked at Yun congsheng with a seductive gaze.</p><p>However, Yun congsheng shivered and his body shrank back. A trace of fear flashed across his eyes as he smiled and said, ” “Forget it, I still have things to do, I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, Yun congsheng left Begonia courtyard as if he was escaping.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yun Haitang murmured, and the greed in her eyes grew stronger.</p><p>……</p><p>For three days in a row, different people explained the art of alchemy to them every day. Lu Ming’s understanding of alchemy improved by leaps and bounds, and his alchemy skills also improved a lot.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming also tried to refine a few pills. He could clearly feel that every time he succeeded in refining a pill, the law of inscription would drop a trace of inscription power, strengthening his mental energy fire. However, the level of the pills he refined was lower than his inscription level. The flame of inscription that dropped was very little.</p><p>Only by refining high-quality elixirs or elixirs of a higher grade than one’s own would the inscription flames descend from the inscription laws be more. It would be of great help to the cultivation of mental energy fire.</p><p>However, to reach that level was not something that could be achieved in a short time.</p><p>For the past three days, Lu Ming did not look for Yun Haitang, and Yun Haitang did not send anyone to look for him.</p><p>On the third day, as night fell, a figure appeared in Lu Ming’s dormitory. It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll bring you to see something interesting!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Interesting things?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Follow me! Be careful!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. Then, the two of them concealed their auras and left the cloud Sea elixir dispensary.</p><p>Soon, a few figures in black robes leaped out from the other side of the cloud Sea Alchemy Academy and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll follow!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered as the two of them followed the black-robed men and flew for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>At this moment, a few black-robed men suddenly landed in a small village.</p><p>we need to hurry up! We must collect the 99 innate blood Qi by tonight!</p><p>One of them said. Lu Ming found his voice somewhat familiar.</p><p>they are indeed here to collect the innate blood Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
