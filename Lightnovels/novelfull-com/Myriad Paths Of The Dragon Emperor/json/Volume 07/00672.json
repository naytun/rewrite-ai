A first level spiritual ocean tier mighty figure had died just like that. Under the combined efforts of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, not even his bones were left behind. His body had been crushed into pieces.</p><p>They already knew that the Shura and the Yaksha were powerful, but seeing this, the hearts of the peak-tier Kings were still in turmoil.</p><p>Too strong, a peak-tier King tier was actually this strong? When the two of them joined hands, they simply complemented each other. It was not as simple as one plus one equals two.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked the burly man’s storage ring into his hand. However, he still felt a little depressed.</p><p>The attack just now was too ferocious. The brawny man’s blood essence was directly annihilated, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. This was the blood essence of a sea of soul realm expert. After Lu Ming refined it, he estimated that his nine Dragon bloodline could be raised to the ninth level of the king level.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly warned himself that he would try not to attack so fiercely in the future.</p><p>“You guys can leave!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming swept his gaze across the dozen peak-tier Kings.</p><p>“Alright, alright, thank you, young master, thank you, young lady!”</p><p>The dozen peak-tier King tiers hurriedly nodded and bowed to express their gratitude before leaving.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, they would have lost all their assets.</p><p>After the dozen peak-tier Kings left, Lu Ming dug out the three Ziying grass.</p><p>“Little Qing, how about we split the things we got from the rainbow Island equally?”</p><p>Lu Ming took the burly man’s storage ring and shook it.</p><p>“I’m fine with anything!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Anything is fine? Why are you so easy to talk to now? you’ve already made clear plans with me in the past, could it be? Don’t tell me?”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to be surprised. He touched his chin and looked at Xie nianqing carefully.</p><p>“What are you looking at? Pervert, what are you thinking?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>hehe, I understand, I understand. We’re a family, so there’s no need to distinguish between us!</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>“Who’s the same family as you? you wish! No, that guy’s storage ring is mine!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened as he sucked in his vital essence, sucking the storage ring from Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“No way, I also contributed, I also have a share!”</p><p>Lu Ming ‘wailed’.</p><p>“Who told you to offend me? You deserve it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing glared at Lu Ming again. He turned around, but there was a smile in his eyes.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This was the storage ring of a spiritual ocean realm expert. It was gone just like that?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached to death. He quickly put away the three herbs, or they would fall into Xie nianqing’s ‘poisonous hands’ again.</p><p>“Hey, you guys broke up, but what about me? What about me? Don’t you guys forget about me!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Go, go to the side and cool off!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at dandan unhappily.</p><p>“Kid, what’s with your attitude? I’m not done with you! Give me the spirit herbs, give me the spirit herbs, or I’ll bite you!”</p><p>As dandan bared her teeth, the two men and the turtle left the canyon and continued to head deeper into the rainbow Island.</p><p>From here on out, he would encounter other martial artists from time to time, and the spiritual herbs slowly increased.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist had turned the seven-colored Island into an Herb Farm, planting spirit herbs everywhere.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist had died 800 years ago, and the seven-colored Island had also disappeared for 800 years. Naturally, there were many spirit herbs here.</p><p>Spirit herbs could be seen on every mountain.</p><p>They were basically level four, level five, and even level six.</p><p>Level six spirit herbs were extremely useful even for sea of soul realm experts. How precious were they? naturally, it triggered a series of fights and Wars.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s cultivation, they were unstoppable. No one was their match.</p><p>Along the way, there were also some who wanted to Rob them. In the end, their blood essence fell into the mouth of the nine Dragon bloodlines.</p><p>A day later, they had a great harvest. They each got more than 300 pieces of Level 5 spiritual herbs and more than a dozen pieces of Level 6 spiritual herbs.</p><p>Even dandan’s harvest was not small, and she put all of it into her mouth.</p><p>“Ah, quickly run!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a few peak-tier Kings flew out of a mountain peak in horror.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming saw the mountain peak glow. Streams of sword Qi burst out and killed several peak-tier Kings in the air.</p><p>“Great inscription formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. On the mountain peak, Lu Ming saw a large inscription formation operating.</p><p>“Little brat, I can sense that there are inscription formations everywhere ahead. It’s quite dangerous!”</p><p>Dandan looked ahead and whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming stared ahead. The mental fire in his sea of consciousness was jumping. He had the same feeling. He felt that there were inscription arrays everywhere in front of him and there was killing intent everywhere.</p><p>I think we’re almost at the core. Otherwise, why would they set up such a large inscription formation? ” Xie nianqing said.</p><p>alright! Lu Ming nodded and said, ” let’s be careful when we go down!</p><p>Then, the two of them slowed down a lot and focused on sensing carefully.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was dancing. He could sense the inscription formation very accurately and would not step into a place with an inscription formation rashly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a Valley, a blazing fire suddenly burst out. A few martial artists screamed in pain and turned into ashes.</p><p>The two of them traveled for thousands of miles and saw that five groups of people had died under the inscription formation.</p><p>Danger was accompanied by opportunities. There were more spiritual herbs here than anywhere else, especially spiritual herbs of the sixth level. The proportion was very high.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stopped and looked ahead.</p><p>In front of them, a large mountain range had collapsed, and the ground was full of potholes.</p><p>It was obvious that a great battle had taken place here, and the area within a hundred miles was in a state of chaos.</p><p>to be able to create such a mark, their combat strength must be terrifying. Could it be that the flood Dragon and a few experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier did it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The two of them patrolled the sky above the land.</p><p>“There’s a corpse, no, it’s half a corpse!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked down.</p><p>The two of them descended and saw half of the corpse. Only the lower half was left. The upper half was missing.</p><p>“It’s that green Mystic old freak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>it seems like this place is really the battlefield between the flood Dragon and the old monsters!</p><p>Xie nianqing said in a low voice.</p><p>The green profound old monster, the cold saber spiritual practitioner, and the red profound old monster were chasing after the flood Dragon. They must have caught up with it and had a big fight. However, it seemed that the green profound old monster had died in the battle, leaving only half of his corpse.</p><p>“They might have gone to the front. The flood Dragon led the Army of sea beasts to attack the Golden sand island, most likely for this Rainbow Island. He charged over without a care for his own safety.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and guessed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, look! There seems to be a Palace up ahead!”</p><p>Xie nianqing suddenly pointed to the front.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over as well. He saw a Palace on a tall mountain peak. However, it was too far away and it was barely visible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
