After a while, I’ll go to other large regions to train. Two years later, I’ll participate in the battle of Providence!</p><p>Lu Ming did not mention desolate but told her his plans.</p><p>hmm, so you already know about the battle of Providence. It seems like Yan kuangtu told you about it. I was going to tell you about this as well. This matter is of great importance to you.</p><p>if you can perform well in the battle of Providence, you might be able to reach Yan kuangtu’s level in the future, or even surpass him, and become the new legend of the Tianxuan region!</p><p>Mu Zheng looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes, full of anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>The legend of the Tianxuan region? To be honest, he didn’t care.</p><p>“By the way, Palace Master, I have something to ask you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?”</p><p>Mu Zheng said.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming asked mu Zheng about old Zhuang’s family.</p><p>When they were on their way to Tianxuan city and were ambushed by the people of the sky corpse sect, old Zhuang had given him his storage ring before he died. Lu Ming had once said that he would hand his storage ring to his family.</p><p>yes, I’ll send someone to investigate. I’ll give you the news tomorrow!</p><p>Mu Zheng nodded. He chatted with Lu Ming for a while more before he bade farewell and left.</p><p>On the second day, mu Zheng indeed sent a message. Old Zhuang did have a family living in the myriad stars city. He had a son and a daughter.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately went to the myriad Star City.</p><p>To the North of myriad stars, there was a small courtyard with weeping willows fluttering in the wind. It was quite elegant.</p><p>However, at this moment, it was broken by an inharmonious scene.</p><p>A group of people surrounded the front of the courtyard.</p><p>“Bastard, don’t even think about taking my sister away!”</p><p>A furious roar rang out.</p><p>The voice came from an eighteen or nineteen-year-old young man. The young man was tall and burly, and he looked simple and honest. At this moment, his face was full of anger as he stared at a middle-aged man with a refined appearance in front of him.</p><p>Behind the young man was a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. The girl had a delicate and sweet appearance. One look and one could tell that she was a rare beauty.</p><p>At this moment, the young girl was also staring at the middle-aged man with an angry expression.</p><p>The young man’s name was Zhuang Xiaoshan, and the young girl’s name was Zhuang xiaorou. Their father was old Zhuang, who had been ambushed and killed by the heavenly corpse sect on their way to the Tianxuan region with Lu Ming.</p><p>The scholarly middle-aged man they were glaring at was called Yao Gu. He was a good friend of their father and also the Ditian Divine Guard of the Ditian divine Palace. His cultivation was similar to old Zhuang’s.</p><p>When old Zhuang was still around, Yao Gu had a good relationship with him. He had taken good care of Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>He did not expect Yao Gu to reveal his beast-like side after the incident with old Zhuang.</p><p>He actually wanted Zhuang xiaorou to be his concubine.</p><p>“Hehe, little brat, you think you can stop me? Let me tell you, when your father went to the Tianxuan region, he borrowed a mid Lv 5 spiritual weapon from me. Although he is dead, the spiritual weapon still needs to be returned. Either you give me the spiritual weapon, or let your sister be my concubine and serve me well. Then, I will forget about the spiritual weapon.”</p><p>Yao Gu laughed coldly. His eyes scanned Zhuang xiaorou’s body without any restraint, and they were filled with passion.</p><p>He had been coveting Zhuang xiaorou’s beauty for a long time. It was just that he could not lay his hands on her back when old Zhuang was around.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s faces were pale.</p><p>Both of them were martial grandmasters, so how could they have a middle Lv 5 spiritual weapon?</p><p>“I will return the middle Lv 5 spiritual weapon to you. I will work hard to cultivate and earn spiritual crystals to buy a spiritual weapon to return it to you. Don’t take my sister and Xiao Rou away!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan stood in front of Zhuang xiaorou and said.</p><p>“Wait for you to return? when will I have to wait? Ten years, twenty years, or fifty years? Perhaps you won’t be able to take out a middle fifth level spiritual weapon in your entire life. Alright, move aside. I’m an acquaintance of your father, and I don’t want to make things difficult for you!”</p><p>Yao Gu sneered.</p><p>But Zhuang Xiaoshan stood there stubbornly, glaring at Yao Gu.</p><p>Yao Gu frowned.</p><p>“Brat, Lord Yao gave you face, but you don’t know how to appreciate it. You’re really looking for death, get lost!”</p><p>A big man with a knife scar on his face shouted. He strode forward and slapped Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan gritted his teeth, and a long spear appeared in his hand, stabbing toward the knife-scarred man’s palm.</p><p>“Little brat, you’re just a ninth grade great Martial Master and you dare to resist? you’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The man with the knife scar sneered hideously. He turned his palm into a claw and burst out his Zhen Qi. He grabbed Zhuang Xiaoshan’s long spear and shook it.</p><p>This man with a knife scar was a half-step King warrior, which was much stronger than Zhuang Xiaoshan. With this shake, his Zhen Qi exploded, shaking the long spear. Zhuang Xiaoshan screamed and flew backward, hitting the wall of the courtyard and cracking it.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan continued to spit out blood.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou cried out in shock and rushed to Zhuang Xiaoshan with tears in her eyes.</p><p>“Xiao Rou, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan shouted.</p><p>“Go, where do you want to go? You can stop dreaming.”</p><p>The man with the knife scar strode forward and sneered.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s faces were filled with despair.</p><p>“Little beauty, it’s your fortune that Lord Yao has taken a fancy to you. Go back and serve Lord Yao well. If you serve him well, you’ll have a good life!”</p><p>The man with the knife scar sneered and reached out to grab Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>“Bastard, get lost!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan roared and struggled to get up, but he was already seriously injured. The bone armor on one of his arms was broken, so he couldn’t exert any strength at all.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou shouted in anger and tried her best to resist, shooting out a few rays of light.</p><p>However, she was only a fifth grade great Martial Master, which was much weaker than the scarred man. She was easily defeated by the scarred man. He grabbed her shoulder and injected his true Qi into her. Zhuang xiaorou’s true Qi was sealed, and she had no power to resist.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou screamed as tears streamed down her face.</p><p>“Xiao Rou!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan roared angrily, his eyes almost splitting. He struggled to get up, but the man with the knife scar kicked him, and Zhuang Xiaoshan flew far away, coughing up blood.</p><p>Yao Gu waved his folding fan and sneered.</p><p>In the surroundings, there were also some residents watching, but no one said a word.</p><p>The myriad stars city was too huge, and the number of people was unknown. Such things happened every day.</p><p>It was impossible for the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to manage everyone. Moreover, the majority of the people in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were in the plane. The myriad Star City was merely a city that was used as a transit point.</p><p>Moreover, Yao Gu himself was a level four martial King realm lower tier. In the myriad stars city, he was the peak existence. Who would dare to provoke him?</p><p>“Hehe, let’s go. We’ll go back and serve Lord Yao!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s eyes swept across Zhuang xiaorou’s body, and a light flashed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
