Later on, the more lamps of mind he lit, the more powerful inscription arrays he would be able to master, and the more powerful his attack power would be.</p><p>...</p><p>The big array that Lu Ming had just carved was only a level-three array and its attack power was limited.</p><p>The combat strength of an inscription master was related to the strength of their mental energy fire, but it was also greatly related to the inscription formation they mastered.</p><p>The stronger one’s mental energy fire was, the more heaven and earth Power one could control.</p><p>The more powerful the formation was, the more terrifying its power would be.</p><p>the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire has some experience. He even has alchemy techniques and the Dao of array formations. However, it’s too complicated now. I’ll sort it out after I refine all of his mental energy fire. Now, I’ll just wait for the inscriptions and the array. Before that, I’ll put the Dao of inscription aside!</p><p>In any case, the earth core flowing flame was refining the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire at all times. His mental energy fire was becoming stronger at all times, so he didn’t need to care about it now.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to study the second bloodline prison-suppressing stele and the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>With a thought, the prison-suppressing stele appeared.</p><p>“Prison-guarding stele, prison-guarding stele, what is it suppressing? The Nine Hells?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The fog in front of the prison-suppressing stele had dispersed, but the other places were still shrouded in fog, looking very mysterious.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly realized that he could feel an extremely heavy feeling lingering in his heart. It was extremely clear.</p><p>“This is the earth? Yes, this is the earth Force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He stepped on the ground, and slowly, he seemed to have become one with the earth.</p><p>Earth Force, yes, this is the earth Force. The prison-suppressing stele is really amazing. It can actually let me feel the earth Force so clearly!</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that this was all because of the prison-suppressing stele. In the past, he did not have such a feeling when he was standing on the ground. However, he had it now.</p><p>It seemed that the prison-suppressing stele was very compatible with the earth.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that as long as he wanted to comprehend the earth Force now, he would be able to do so very quickly and master it.</p><p>“Do I need to comprehend it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little hesitant.</p><p>Once he comprehended Earth Force, the force he could control, and even the heaven Earth intent realm, would become four types. His cultivation speed would definitely become slower.</p><p>The more intents one comprehended, the greater the repelling force would be, and the harder it would be to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming had to consider it.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at the prison suppressing heavenly art first before considering!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and closed his eyes. The information about the prison suppressing heaven technique appeared in his mind.</p><p>During this period of time, he had not properly looked at the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>Instantly, all the information related to the prison suppressing heaven technique reverberated in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>After more than an hour, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“What a wondrous martial technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a hint of surprise.</p><p>Without a doubt, the prison suppressing heaven art was a martial skill and a bloodline martial skill. However, it was very different from other martial skills.</p><p>First of all, the prison suppressing heavenly art did not have any fixed moves. It was more like a battle technique.</p><p>After successfully cultivating it, one could use the power of the bloodline to suppress everything with the power of the prison-suppressing stele in every punch, palm, and even kick. The power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>When one reached the highest level, not only could they use their hands and feet, but every part of their body could be used for battle. Their back and shoulders could contain the power of the prison-suppressing stele and release terrifying attacks, turning them into killing weapons.</p><p>Also, the prison suppressing heavenly art didn’t have a specific grade, and it had a lot to do with bloodline power.</p><p>The stronger the bloodline power, the more powerful the prison-suppressing stele would be.</p><p>If a ninth level King bloodline was awakened, the power of the prison suppression heavenly art could barely reach the power of the first level of a low-tier demigod martial technique. If a first level divine bloodline was awakened, the power of the prison suppression heavenly art could even reach the power of the sixth level of a low-tier demigod martial technique.</p><p>Demigod level. Lu Ming’s eyes glowed brightly.</p><p>For others, the level of the bloodline that they could awaken was fixed. However, Lu Ming could keep on advancing. This martial arts technique was simply too suitable for him.</p><p>However, the prison suppressing heaven technique had a requirement, which was to use the earth mentality as the main force to unleash the strongest power. This was because the earth mentality was the most compatible with the prison suppressing stele.</p><p>“Looks like I still need to comprehend Earth Force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a bitter smile.</p><p>However, Lu Ming made a decision very quickly. He would comprehend it.</p><p>Comprehending the momentum of the earth and the will of the earth would greatly increase his combat strength. Moreover, if he were to integrate the will of the earth into the dragon God’s three absolutes in the future, the Dragon God’s three absolutes would transform into a low-grade demigod martial technique.</p><p>It could be said to be killing three birds with one stone.</p><p>Lu Ming went through the details of the prison-suppressing heavenly technique in his mind in detail. Then, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline emerged. Lu Ming planned to start comprehending the force of the earth. When he had some mastery over it, he would combine it with the force of the earth and cultivate the prison-suppressing heavenly technique together.</p><p>He took out the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it beside him. Lu Ming’s mind became extremely clear.</p><p>He seemed to have become one with the ground.</p><p>He seemed to see the island going all the way down to the bottom of the ocean, merging with the endless earth.</p><p>A feeling of heaviness, magnificence, vastness, and vicissitudes rippled in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming’s body also exuded a heavy, Grand, vast, and ancient feeling.</p><p>Earth Force, elementary level.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes. He suddenly stood up and struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This palm seemed to be extremely heavy and heavy, as if it could crush space.</p><p>There was an explosion and Lu Ming stopped. He frowned and muttered,”No, again!”</p><p>At this moment, he was cultivating the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used his palm, his fist, and his fingers at times, slashing at the air continuously.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming cultivated for three consecutive days.</p><p>Three days later, every time he struck out with his palm, it was as if his palm contained a huge mountain, causing the air to rumble and explode.</p><p>After cultivating for more than ten minutes, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>After three days of cultivation, the prison suppressing heaven technique could be considered to be at the beginner level. However, Lu Ming could only use it with his hands now. There was still a long way to go before he could use it with his feet. As for using it with his entire body, the distance was even greater.</p><p>For the past few days, Lu Ming did not continue to comprehend Earth Force.</p><p>He wanted to take advantage of the fact that the earth Force was still at a low level to integrate it into the other three intents. Otherwise, when the earth Force was at a high level, it would be even more difficult to integrate.</p><p>The stronger the fire, the stronger the rejection.</p><p>“Let’s go and see how little Qing’s cultivation is going.”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the other side of the island.</p><p>Xie nianqing was cultivating on the other side of the island.</p><p>When they arrived at the other side of the island, they saw Xie nianqing standing by the shore, frowning in deep thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
