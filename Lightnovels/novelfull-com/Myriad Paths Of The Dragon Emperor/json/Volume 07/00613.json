Its history is so ancient that it’s even older than martial arts!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in shock.</p><p>In the past, he had thought that the Dao of inscription only existed to support the martial Dao. It seemed that he had been wrong and mistaken.</p><p>The primordial era was an era that was even older than the ancient, primordial, and primordial times. When the human race first appeared, there was no martial arts.</p><p>The human race had comprehended a kind of pattern based on the traces of the world and the great trend of the mountains and rivers. This pattern was the earliest inscription.</p><p>In the end, it developed and expanded, forming a kind of great Dao.</p><p>The Dao of inscription was one of the oldest DAOs in the world.</p><p>The Dao of inscriptions could be used to forge weapons, refine pills, inscribe formations, and so on.</p><p>In order to practice the Dao of inscription, one must first light up a mental fire in the sea of consciousness. Mental fire was also known as the fire of inscription.</p><p>Only by igniting the mental fire could one be considered to have officially stepped onto the path of inscription.</p><p>Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, silver, and gold.</p><p>Alchemists were divided into nine levels, and the color of the mental fire at each level was different.</p><p>A level 1 mind fire was red, and a level 2 mind fire was orange …</p><p>And so on, the mental fire of a ninth-rank Alchemist was golden.</p><p>Each person had ten mind lamps in their sea of consciousness at each level. The more mind lamps were lit, the stronger the mind fire.</p><p>Mental fire was the foundation of an inscription master. The stronger the mental fire, the more precise one’s control of inscriptions would be.</p><p>Generally speaking, at each level, one could advance if they could light three spirit lamps.</p><p>For example, if a first-level Alchemist lit up three red Spirit lamps, he could advance and break through, turning the color of his Spirit Fire into orange and lighting an orange spirit lamp.</p><p>After cultivating and lighting up three orange lamps, he could continue to break through.</p><p>However, this kind of inscription master was just an ordinary inscription master. They were mainly used to assist in the cultivation of martial arts. They were also the inscription Masters that Lu Ming often saw.</p><p>Only by lighting up six mind lamps at each level, or even more, could one be considered a pure inscription master, known as a true inscription master.</p><p>Of course, if one could light up ten spirit lamps at each level, they would be perfect and the strongest inscriber.</p><p>However, according to dandan, it was too difficult to light up ten spirit lamps. Such an inscriber would become extremely powerful once they reached rank five.</p><p>this Jade token only contains some basic knowledge. Take a look at the rest. There’s also an introduction on how to cultivate and some low-level inscriptions that I’ve collected and mastered. Kid, I’ll let you have a good look!</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan said triumphantly while chewing on the spirit herb.</p><p>Lu Ming took out another Jade card and placed it between his eyebrows.</p><p>This Jade tablet contained all the records about the level one inscriptions.</p><p>There were hundreds of thousands of them.</p><p>Lu Ming was dazzled. After a long time, he picked up another Jade card. This Jade card also had a level one inscription.</p><p>After that, six to seven Jade plates were filled with level one inscriptions. In total, there were more than three million types.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He had never eaten pork but had never seen a pig run?</p><p>Although Lu Ming was not an Alchemist, he still had some general knowledge.</p><p>Although level one inscriptions were the lowest level inscriptions and were the most numerous, it was already good enough for an ordinary inscriber to master hundreds of them. However, there were more than three million of them here, which was simply terrifying.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to watch.</p><p>After that were the level 2 and Level 3 inscriptions.</p><p>Dandan did not have a level four inscription.</p><p>There were also over a million types of Level 2 inscriptions and over 600000 types of Level 3 inscriptions.</p><p>The number was shocking.</p><p>“How is it? I’ve lived for countless years and have come into contact with countless inscriptions. Now, do you believe me?”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s shocked expression, dandan felt extremely pleased and proud.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not give a heavy blow.</p><p>This fellow had actually mastered so many inscriptions. Perhaps what it said was true.</p><p>The last Jade tablet contained a cultivation technique, a cultivation technique for cultivating the mental energy fire.</p><p>The cultivation method was called the meditation of the underworld.</p><p>Lu Ming comprehended for a while and opened his eyes.</p><p>“Kid, how is it? Isn’t this spiritual cultivation technique earth-shattering?”</p><p>Dandan immediately asked smugly.</p><p>“I don’t feel anything!” Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“No feeling? You … You really don’t know your stuff!”</p><p>Dandan pursed her lips and said, ” that’s true. You haven’t started cultivating yet, so you won’t be able to experience the wonders of this cultivation technique. Let me tell you, if this cultivation technique is leaked, even a Martial Emperor will hunt you down. All the inscription Masters in the world will hunt you down.</p><p>“It’s that serious?”</p><p>Lu Ming was skeptical.</p><p>“Nonsense, do you think I would lie? Kid, you don’t have a fire seed now, but you’ll know the benefits when you find one, light your Spirit Fire, and start cultivating.”</p><p>also, let me tell you. If you want to cultivate the Dao of inscription, you must be careful with the flame and it must be strong. If you use an ordinary flame to ignite the mental fire, it will have a great impact on your cultivation of the mental fire later on. The higher the level of the flame, the more powerful it will be. In the future, your cultivation will be twice as effective with half the effort. The power of the mental fire will also be stronger. In the future, whether it’s refining weapons, refining pills, or inscribing inscriptions, it will be of great help to you.</p><p>Dandan warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Since he was going to cultivate, he would naturally cultivate in the best direction. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be a waste of time?</p><p>He planned to wait until he found a satisfactory fire seed before lighting up the mental energy fire. For the time being, he would put the matter of inscription aside.</p><p>After that, he continued to comprehend the Thunder concept.</p><p>Three days later, mu xiuyuan came to find him and told him that Mu Lan had left for a secret place far away to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He knew that Mu Lan was most likely still angry with him. Otherwise, why didn’t she even come to say goodbye?</p><p>He could tell that Mu Lan was interested in him.</p><p>How could he not have feelings for Mu Lan? However, in his heart, there was someone he could not let go of.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said a few words and left. Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>let’s not think about these things for the time being. Now, improving my strength is the most important thing. Everything can wait until I pass the test of Di Yi and Martial Emperor. Now, it’s time to go back!</p><p>Lu Ming planned to return to the Lu family and use the elixir of life to treat Lu Yuntian’s injuries.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming left Tianxuan city and headed east at top speed.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s terrifying speed, he arrived at the eastern Palace in just five days.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered the eastern Palace, the news of his return spread throughout the entire Palace.</p><p>Teleportation and disappearance happened very quickly. The news that Lu Ming had defeated the sacred constellation had already been sent back to the eastern Palace. Countless people rushed out, wanting to meet Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure flashed, avoiding the crowd and appearing outside the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>He saw a figure outside the eastern sky courtyard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
