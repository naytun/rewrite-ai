Just like what Mu Lan said, you’re still young and should focus on martial arts. I’m really looking forward to how far you can go in the future!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan sighed.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming had not yet reached the king tier. He was still young and weak, and needed his guidance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had left him far behind. How long had it been? It was simply too fast.</p><p>“Maybe he’s another Yan Kuang tu!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan sighed in his heart.</p><p>“Brother mu, I’m going back to recuperate!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Okay, you should go back now!”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and turned to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re an idiot. You rejected such a beautiful lady. You’re simply wasting her. What a pity, what a pity!</p><p>On the way, dandan shouted and sighed.</p><p>“Shut up, you perverted turtle!”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up dandan and stuffed it into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He didn’t head to the fourth area, but rented a house in the first area.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in his room, Lu Ming took out a few healing pills and swallowed them. Then, he circulated the true war Dragon technique and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>Earlier, he had taken one of Guan wuchen’s attacks head-on and was severely injured. The bones in his arm were broken and his muscles were torn in many places.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current physical body was extremely powerful and his vitality was extremely tenacious.</p><p>While he was talking earlier, his body was already healing on its own. With the help of the medicinal effects, he was recovering even faster.</p><p>In a Pavilion in the fourth area, Mu Lan and mu xiuyuan stood side by side, looking into the distance.</p><p>“You’re angry with him?”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Mu Lan said calmly, ” feelings can’t be forced. Moreover, Lu Ming is still young. He should focus on martial arts!</p><p>“Actually, you should know that there should be someone else in his heart!”</p><p>Mu Xiu Yuan sighed.</p><p>Mu Lan’s eyes flickered. She then smiled sweetly and said,”I know, of course I know, but do you think I’ll lose? I’ve decided, I’m going to have a good fight.”</p><p>“Compete?”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan stared blankly for a moment, then immediately smiled and said, ” haha, this is more like the MU Lan I know. Speaking of which, Lu Ming is indeed outstanding. I can’t miss out on him so easily. If I were a woman, I’d also fight for him.</p><p>however, the distance between us is getting bigger and bigger. So, I’ve decided to go to that place to cultivate. I can’t be left behind by him too much!</p><p>Mu Lan’s gaze looked into the distance as she spoke.</p><p>“You’ve finally decided to go there to cultivate?”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right. In the past, father arranged for me to go, but I didn’t want to listen to everything he arranged, so I didn’t go. Now, I should go.”</p><p>Mu Lan sighed.</p><p>it’s the right choice for you to go there to cultivate. Otherwise, with your physique, it would be a waste. It’s not too late to go now!</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>……</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming’s injuries had already healed. His seventh-grade body had displayed an extremely strong self-healing ability.</p><p>the spiritual ocean tier is indeed powerful. I wonder what level of spiritual ocean tier that Shangguan Wu Chen is at, and how much of his power he has used? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that Shangguan Wu Chen’s level in the spiritual ocean tier should not be too high. Otherwise, even if it was a casual palm strike, it was not something that he could withstand.</p><p>“When I break through to peak-tier King, I wonder if I can fight against sea of soul realm experts?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very much looking forward to it.</p><p>However, what he needed to do now was to forge a spirit weapon spear.</p><p>The wind Lightning Spear of upper Lv 5 had been broken again after it had taken a hit from Shangguan Wu Chen during the battle with the Holy star.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current explosive power, a fifth-level spiritual weapon was no longer of much use.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and headed to elder Huang’s residence.</p><p>“WOWO, Lu Ming, you animal, don’t just grab things and stuff them into that d * mn place!”</p><p>Suddenly, he heard dandan’s voice. He did not know when it appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder again, panting.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This guy could actually run out of the Supreme shrine on his own.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t you know who I am? I’m the head of the top ten war beasts, and I’ve existed for countless years. My inscribing skills have long reached a level that can shock the heavens and make ghosts and gods cry. How can a mere Supreme divine Hall trap me? Aiya, I’m exhausted!”</p><p>Dandan boasted shamelessly as she laid on Lu Ming’s shoulder with her turtle shell facing down, panting heavily.</p><p>stop bragging. A person who often fails to carve an inscription, no, a turtle, is still kind enough to talk about his own inscription technique, shocking the heavens and earth, crying ghosts and gods.</p><p>Lu Ming was full of disdain.</p><p>“Kid, what do you know? If I wasn’t injured …”</p><p>A man and a turtle quarreled noisily, and soon, they arrived at old Huang’s residence.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in directly.</p><p>“Elder Huang, elder Huang, I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Clang clang clang …</p><p>A clatter came from a room, and then an old man with messy hair rushed out.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re finally back. I thought you were dead. Did you bring back the thousand refined blood gold?”</p><p>Elder Huang grinned and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ve brought it back,”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the thousand refined blood gold appeared in his hand.</p><p>yeah, this whole piece is enough. Sigh, it’s a pity for Xuan long!</p><p>Old Huang sighed.</p><p>Obviously, old Huang had also received the news that the weapon forging sect had been destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart and did not say much.</p><p>alright, you don’t have to think about anything else. I’ve studied the inscriptions on the broken spear you gave me and learned a lot. I’ve extracted the infinite black Gold from the broken spear. I can start refining it now, but it will take three days. You can come and get it in three days!</p><p>Old Huang said.</p><p>“Alright then, I’ll have to trouble you, senior.”</p><p>Lu Ming passed the thousand refined blood gold to elder Huang.</p><p>“Alright, go!”</p><p>Elder Huang took the thousand-refined blood gold and rushed into the house.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This elder Huang was really an amazing person.</p><p>“This old man is just an ordinary inscription master. He’s not even a true inscription master, so I don’t think he can forge any good spirit weapons.”</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This guy was really bragging without thinking. Elder Huang was the number one inscription master in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Furthermore, it was not easy to find a true Ming refiner. It was too difficult and the requirements were too high.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled along the streets. Not long after, he arrived at the courtyard that Mu Lan had sent him off to six months ago and walked in.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the room, Lu Ming quietly comprehended the Thunder concept.</p><p>As long as his Thunder concept broke through to the completion of level one, he would be able to easily cultivate the other two concepts to the completion of level one.</p><p>With enough resources, Lu Ming could break through to peak-tier King.</p><p>The next day, a figure walked into the courtyard. It was Yan kuangtu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
