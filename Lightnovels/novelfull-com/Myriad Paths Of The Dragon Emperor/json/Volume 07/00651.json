Your storage ring is mine.”</p><p>...</p><p>With a cold snort, an old ou Fei went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>Old ou was dressed in a bright red robe, and his aura was at Lv 7 martial King realm.</p><p>it’s grandma red flower. She’s about to make her move. She’s a ruthless person who has won five consecutive rounds in the LV 7 martial King realm.</p><p>that’s right. She only acts when she sees that the harvest is great. The bald old man had just obtained a Lv 7 martial King realm martial artist’s storage ring. Now, as long as we kill the bald old man, we’ll be able to get two storage rings.</p><p>let’s see if that bald old man dares to accept the challenge. Every time red flower granny fought, her opponents would die miserably!</p><p>As soon as old ou went on stage, a burst of exclamations came from the surroundings.</p><p>“Grandma red flower!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, the bald old man’s expression also changed greatly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Granny red flower’s face turned cold, and her killing intent spread. She was about to attack.</p><p>“Wait a minute! Wait a minute, I admit defeat, I don’t want to fight!”</p><p>The bald old man quickly called out.</p><p>“Don’t fight?”</p><p>Red flower Granny’s face darkened. hand over 200000 Supreme spiritual crystals. You’re so gutless!</p><p>The bald elder took out 200000 spiritual crystals from his storage ring and handed them over to granny red flower. Then, he left the fighting ring and flew to the stands.</p><p>“Is there anyone who wants to fight me?”</p><p>Grandma red flower put away the spiritual crystals and looked around.</p><p>However, no one went up.</p><p>Granny red flower was an extremely powerful Lv 7 martial King realm martial artist and had few opponents. Who would want to go up there and die?</p><p>After waiting for a while and seeing that no one went up, red flower granny also left the fighting ring.</p><p>well, it’s quite interesting. Miss Luo, what are the rules of this life battle stage? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Luo Xin.</p><p>“Young master Lu, it’s your first time here. It’s normal that you don’t know. Let me explain for you.”</p><p>Luo Xin smiled faintly and said, ” as the name suggests, it’s the life battle stage. You fight with your life. As long as you get on the battle stage, it’s a gamble of life. The winner will win all of the other party’s belongings. The loser will not only lose his life, but also all of his belongings. All of his storage rings will belong to the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“Then how could that bald old man admit defeat?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>there’s a rule on the fated battle platform. Those with higher cultivation levels can’t challenge those with lower cultivation levels. Of course, if those with lower cultivation levels challenge those with higher cultivation levels, it’s up to them.</p><p>once you’re on the fated battle platform and someone challenges you, you have to accept the challenge. However, you can admit defeat before the battle begins. As long as you hand over a certain number of Supreme spiritual crystals to the opponent, you can skip the battle!</p><p>just now, when red flower granny challenged the bald elder, the bald elder knew that he was no match for her. However, before the battle began, he immediately admitted defeat and could leave the stage as long as he handed over 200000 Supreme spiritual crystals to her. If he admitted defeat after the battle began, the bald elder could choose not to accept it until he defeated and killed his opponent to take all his belongings!</p><p>of course, the higher one’s cultivation level is, the higher the price of admitting defeat. If a peak-tier King admits defeat before the battle, he will have to pay his opponent a million Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Luo Xin explained to Lu Ming in detail.</p><p>“Then the death rate is very high!” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course, after the war began, the death rate was as high as 80% to 90%. Only a few people could escape with their lives!</p><p>Luo Xin said.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. The death rate was as high as 80% to 90%. Basically, once they went up, they would either win or die.</p><p>“Miss, why are you talking so much to him? A young master like him, who came from a major force, would never dare to step onto such a fighting stage. This is a real life-and-death battle, not a sparring match between fellow disciples. It’s a life-and-death battle, a fight of everything!”</p><p>At the side, Chen Zhao revealed a mocking expression and said disdainfully.</p><p>Lu Ming had caused him to lose face that time and he was still brooding over it.</p><p>“Oh? Then do you dare to go up?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Chen Zhao.</p><p>Chen Zhao’s face stiffened, then he said,”what do you know?” My big brother has won six times in a row, and he’s a peak-tier King. He’s much stronger than the peak-tier kings of the blood evil Pirates. If my big brother was here last time, he wouldn’t even need so many moves to kill them!”</p><p>Chen Zhao changed the topic and pointed at the brawny man in his thirties next to him.</p><p>“Why are you carrying your big brother out? I’m talking about you. You’re also a Lv 7 martial King, right? If you’re so awesome, why didn’t you challenge red flower granny?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Chen Zhao’s face stiffened and turned red.</p><p>His combat strength was only considered ordinary among Lv 7 martial Kings. Wouldn’t he be courting death if he went up?</p><p>However, Lu Ming had grasped this point and he could not refute it at all.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Beside him, Xie nianqing muttered, showing his interest.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his eyes revealing his interest.</p><p>Lu Ming was more interested in the fact that he had to stake all his assets in one battle.</p><p>Although he had gotten 80 million Supreme spiritual crystals from the elders of the cloud Sea alchemy institution, he had used up 18 million when he tried to break through to the peak-tier King realm, so he still had 60 million left.</p><p>More than sixty million seemed like a lot. In fact, it was far from enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>In the future, these spirit crystals wouldn’t be enough to break through to the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The spirit ocean realm was to open up the spirit ocean. A Zhen Yuan ocean, a Zhen Yuan ocean, the energy required was too much.</p><p>The amount of true Yuan a first level spiritual ocean tier martial artist could store was more than ten times that of a peak-tier King, or even more.</p><p>Lu Ming needed 18 million Supreme spiritual crystals to break through to the peak-tier King realm. Lu Ming estimated that he would need at least 300 million Supreme spiritual crystals to open up the spirit sea realm. This was a conservative estimate. In fact, he might need more.</p><p>He was still far from 300 million Supreme spiritual crystals. Therefore, he needed to accumulate more Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>This life battle stage was a good channel.</p><p>Furthermore, he could also train his martial arts techniques and devour his opponent’s blood essence to increase the grade of his bloodline. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the life battle platform.</p><p>At this moment, another person stepped into the air and stepped onto the fated battle platform. His aura spread out without any reservation.</p><p>Peak-tier King. This was a peak-tier King.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall became lively again.</p><p>Spiritual ocean tier Warriors rarely participated in this kind of gambling battle, and peak King tier stood at the peak of King tiers. Each battle would attract the interest of a large number of martial artists.</p><p>“Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>This peak-tier King was a burly man in his forties, and he looked around.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A white-haired old man stepped onto the fighting ring and stood opposite the burly man.</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, the two of them began to fight.</p><p>The violent Qi spread out in all directions and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, a light screen rose around the fighting ring and blocked the Qi.</p><p>It was obvious that the fighting ring was engraved with a powerful inscription formation to prevent the audience from being hurt.</p><p>The battle was intense, and the two peak-tier Kings weren’t weak. They weren’t any weaker than the scar-faced man from the blood Fiend Pirates.</p><p>That’s right, without a strong combat strength, one wouldn’t dare to step onto the fated battle platform, or else it would be courting death.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
