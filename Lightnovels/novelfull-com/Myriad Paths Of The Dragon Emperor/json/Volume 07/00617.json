He had never expected that the Zhuang siblings would want to acknowledge him as their master.</p><p>...</p><p>“Lord Lu Ming, please accept us as your disciples. We will definitely work hard in our cultivation and not embarrass you!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan kowtowed, and Zhuang xiaorou quickly followed.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He sized up the two of them. Although their aptitudes were not top-notch, they were considered to be outstanding talents. They might be able to achieve something after some training.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had never thought of taking in disciples. He was not old and most importantly, he did not have the time to teach the two of them.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers also looked on curiously. They were all guessing whether Lu Ming would accept it or not.</p><p>“How about this? I’ll take you all in as my in-name disciples!” Lu Ming said after pondering for a while.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were overjoyed. They bowed and said, ” “Master, please accept this disciple’s bow!”</p><p>Although they were only in-name disciples and not personal disciples, the two of them were satisfied.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but touch his nose. He had a strange feeling in his heart. He did not expect that he would have a disciple so soon.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times and said,”alright, get up. But I …” I’ll tell you first that I don’t have time to teach you during this period of time. I’ll bring you to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to cultivate first. I’ll teach you when I’m free in the future!”</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou bowed again and then stood up.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace first!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming brought the Zhuang siblings and headed towards the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers were all extremely envious.</p><p>old Zhuang’s son and daughter are so blessed to have Lu Ming as their master. It’s really a blessing that they have accumulated over eight lifetimes!</p><p>that’s right. This time, he’s going to be successful. Old Zhuang can also die with a smile.</p><p>“I’m so envious!”</p><p>Everyone was in a heated discussion. The news that Lu Ming had taken in two disciples had also spread.</p><p>Lu Ming led the Zhuang siblings into the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>“Xiaoshan, you should heal first!”</p><p>Lu Ming passed Zhuang Xiaoshan a bottle of healing pills.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan took the elixir, swallowed one, and sat down cross-legged to heal his injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his finger and a stream of vital essence flew into Zhuang Xiaoshan’s body to help him heal. Zhuang Xiaoshan’s injuries recovered quickly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent a message.</p><p>Half an hour later, Zhuang Xiaoshan’s condition had stabilized, and he opened his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, a figure stepped through the air and arrived. It was mu Zheng.</p><p>“Xiao Shan, Xiao Rou, this is Palace Master mu Zheng!”</p><p>Lu Ming introduced the two of them.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou were both shocked. They quickly walked to mu Zheng’s side and bowed.</p><p>They had grown up in the myriad stars city and had heard of mu Zheng’s name for a long time, but they had never seen him before. They did not expect to meet this legendary figure the moment they acknowledged Lu Ming as their master.</p><p>The two of them were very excited.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I just received news that you have accepted two disciples. I was just about to come and congratulate you when I received your message.”</p><p>Mu Zheng laughed.</p><p>“Palace Master mu must be joking. Palace Master, I’m afraid Lu Ming won’t have much time to guide them in the future. I want to leave the two of them in the eastern sky courtyard and cultivate in the Emperor sky divine Palace. What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course, no problem. Don’t worry, I’ll come and teach them when I have time!</p><p>Mu Zheng said straightforwardly.</p><p>“Many thanks, Palace Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>As for the Zhuang siblings, they were naturally overjoyed.</p><p>“Take these two command tokens. In the future, you can enter and leave the Empyrean heaven divine Palace as you wish!”</p><p>Mu Zheng gave Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou a token each.</p><p>The brother and sister were naturally overjoyed and thanked him once again. Mu Zheng smiled and then took his leave.</p><p>“Xiao Shan, continue to heal your injuries. When you’ve recovered, I’ll teach you some martial arts techniques!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan’s injuries had already healed.</p><p>Lu Ming also taught them based on their talents, passing on some cultivation methods and martial arts techniques.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan’s bloodline was a Black Mountain. Lu Ming found a low-class heaven level cultivation skill, the thousand mountains technique, in the storage ring for Zhuang Xiaoshan to cultivate.</p><p>As for Zhuang xiaorou’s Blood Meridian, it was a small, blue sword. It was crystal clear and had a strong water attribute. Lu Ming found a soft water sword technique, which was also a heaven level low-rank technique.</p><p>He also gave them a few suitable martial arts techniques.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming had imparted the myriad spiritual combat body to the two of them.</p><p>After that, he gave each of them three drops of mid-grade primordial origin liquid to help them refine their fleshly bodies.</p><p>The cultivation of the two of them improved every day.</p><p>This was all he could give the two of them for the time being. In the future, they would have to rely on themselves.</p><p>As for the true war Dragon technique, one had to start cultivating it before the invigorated Meridian realm. Otherwise, one would not be able to cultivate it.</p><p>The three absolutes of the Dragon God also required the comprehension of many different intents. There was no way to teach them these.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming left the Empyrean heaven divine Palace under the reluctant gazes of the Zhuang siblings.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had to return to the blazing sun Empire to treat Lu Yuntian’s meridians.</p><p>Lu Ming flew towards the blazing sun Empire at top speed.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had been stable ever since it was unified.</p><p>Everyone knew that Lu Ming was standing behind the pool. No one would have second thoughts. With the help of the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley, the imperial family’s power was rapidly recovering and becoming more prosperous.</p><p>The Lu family in the Eastern Region of the blazing sun Empire had also become an extremely special family. Although they were not very powerful, everyone had to give them face. The Lu family had been developing rapidly in this period of time. Countless powerful martial artists had joined the Lu family. The Lu family’s strength had expanded by dozens of times, and their business had spread to hundreds of cities nearby.</p><p>However, no one in the Lu family would forget that all of this was brought about by Lu Ming. Without Lu Ming, everything they had would have vanished in an instant.</p><p>In the courtyard of the Lu clan’s patriarch residence, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were sitting at a stone table. They were brewing tea and chatting as they drank.</p><p>Even though Lu Yuntian was the patriarch of the Lu clan, he would not show his face for the minor matters. He would leave everything to his subordinates to handle, and he was happy to be idle.</p><p>“I wonder how Ming ‘er is doing now!”</p><p>Li Ping suddenly sighed.</p><p>“What’s wrong? I miss Ming ‘er.” Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>“Don’t you want to?”</p><p>Li Ping rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What a womanly woman. Ming ‘er is now at the golden age for cultivation, so he naturally has to go out and explore. We’ll stay at home and take care of our bodies so that Ming’ er won’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said. Although he said that, the longing in his eyes could not be dispelled.</p><p>“You’re the only one with a tough mouth!”</p><p>Li Ping glared at Lu Yuntian.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in the courtyard. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping shuddered. They looked at Lu Ming and were overjoyed.”Ming ‘er, you’re back?”</p><p>“Father, mother, Ming ‘er has returned to see you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
