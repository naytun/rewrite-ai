If Lord Yao is tired of playing with her, perhaps he will reward her to me in the future, hehe!”</p><p>...</p><p>The knife-scarred man thought happily.</p><p>The reason why he was so enthusiastic was because he had this idea.</p><p>Because in the past, Yao Gu had given women he was tired of playing with to his subordinates.</p><p>Behind Yao Gu, the others gritted their teeth and looked at the man with the knife scar enviously. They secretly regretted not moving faster just now and letting that guy beat them to it again.</p><p>“You’d better, immediately, let go of your dirty hands!”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely cold voice rang out.</p><p>His voice was like the snow in winter, cold and bone-chilling.</p><p>A young man around the age of 20 strolled over, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>He was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>After he got old Zhuang’s address and his family’s situation, he immediately rushed over, but he encountered this scene.</p><p>The knife-scarred man looked at Lu Ming gloomily and sneered, ” “Kid, are you talking to me?”</p><p>“I’ll give you three breaths of time to let go of your dirty hands. Otherwise, die!”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, brat, you’re very arrogant, but arrogance requires skill.”</p><p>The knife-scarred man laughed.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s face changed and he angrily shouted,”Kid, do you know who my master is? My Lord is a lower tier King and a level three empyrean heaven Divine Guard. You’d better behave yourself!”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Lu Ming coldly spat out the word ‘three’ and said, ” “Time’s Up, you have no chance.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming’s figure disappeared. In the next moment, he appeared in front of the scarred man, clasping his throat and lifting him up high.</p><p>The scar-faced man’s eyes popped out immediately. He could not exert any strength at all. There was fear in his eyes. Just now, he did not react at all. Lu Ming’s speed was too fast.</p><p>Naturally, he let go of Zhuang xiaorou’s shoulder.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou quickly ran to Zhuang Xiaoshan’s side to check on his injuries.</p><p>“Xiao Rou, I’m fine!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan struggled to get up. He looked at Lu Ming with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p>“Who is this young man? Is he father’s friend? Why didn’t I hear father mention it before?”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou looked at Lu Ming and thought to themselves.</p><p>“Lord Yao, save me, save me!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man shouted.</p><p>At this moment, Yao Gu’s expression was grave. He did not see clearly how Lu Ming had attacked.</p><p>“Don’t cry out. No one can save you today. Go on your way.”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man screamed in horror. His hands were grabbing and his feet were kicking, as if he wanted to grab a trace of hope.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he was just a little chick. He could not resist at all.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming exerted some force and broke the knife-scarred man’s neck. The knife-scarred man’s cries stopped abruptly.</p><p>brat, How dare you! You actually dare to kill people in the ten thousand stars city! Someone, quickly inform the law enforcement team of the Emperor heaven divine Palace to take down this evil demon!</p><p>Yao Gu roared.</p><p>The reason why he did not make a sound just now was that he was waiting. He was waiting for Lu Ming to kill the knife-scarred burly man. Then, he would have an excuse to call the Law enforcement team.</p><p>In the myriad Star City, it was fine to injure or even maim people. But killing people was not allowed. They would be punished by the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s law enforcement team.</p><p>This was the rule.</p><p>Sometimes, when dealing with someone, one didn’t need to use force to solve it. One could just use their brain.</p><p>Yao Gu thought smugly.</p><p>As for the sacrifice of the knife-scarred man’s life, what was that? It was just a dog.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not seem to know that he had committed a serious crime. He looked at Yao Gu and the rest with a cold expression, his killing intent overflowing.</p><p>Yao Gu’s expression changed and he shouted angrily,”brat, what are you trying to do?” Do you still want to kill us? you’re simply guilty of the most heinous crimes, you’re crazy, and you’re a demon!”</p><p>you scums! You’re a scourge if you stay in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. You must all die!</p><p>Lu Ming strolled forward, his voice cold.</p><p>“Brat, you think killing a half-step King is that big of a deal? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>A Lv 1 martial King realm burly man jumped out and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>This punch was accompanied by the will of the mountain. It was like a burly man smashing toward Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, he was kicked by Lu Ming and flew out. He fell on the ground dozens of meters away and was no longer breathing. He was dead!</p><p>“Brat, you’ve killed another person. You’re dead!”</p><p>Yao Gu roared.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and flicked his fingers.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than a dozen spearlights burst out.</p><p>After that, more than a dozen shrieks could be heard. Yao Gu’s men, regardless of whether they were martial Kings or above, were all nailed to the ground by the spear ray.</p><p>He only spared Yao Gu!</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>The surrounding onlookers gasped.</p><p>In their eyes, this young man was too ruthless. In the ten thousand stars city, he didn’t show any mercy and killed more than a dozen people in a row. Wasn’t he afraid of the law enforcement team’s punishment? Or was it because he had already killed one person in the beginning and decided to go all out?</p><p>At this moment, Yao Gu’s face was ashen, and a trace of fear could be seen in his eyes.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s eyes revealed a trace of worry.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed so many people. The law enforcement team was about to arrive. What should they do?</p><p>“So, how do you want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yao Gu.</p><p>“You … You’re finished, you’ve killed so many people, you’re finished!”</p><p>Yao Gu roared, but his body retreated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Ah, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Yao Gu was shocked and immediately roared. A saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The attack of a Lv 4 martial King was extremely shocking. The surrounding spectators retreated, afraid of being affected.</p><p>But the next scene left them dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even take out his spiritual weapon. He directly slapped Yao Gu with his bare hand.</p><p>With a clang, Lu Ming’s palm landed on Yao Gu’s saber. Yao Gu’s medium Lv 5 saber was sent flying away, but Lu Ming’s palm was not affected at all. He continued to slap Yao Gu.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A slap landed on Yao Gu’s face and a crisp sound was heard. Yao Gu spun around on the spot for dozens of times and then looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>He could not even fight back against Lu Ming.</p><p>Who was this young man? It was too terrifying.</p><p>Yao Gu’s heart was suddenly filled with endless fear.</p><p>“So, how do you want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yao Gu indifferently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds came from the sky. More than a dozen figures streaked across the void and flew over. Powerful auras emanated from these people.</p><p>Among them, there were three lower tier King level experts.</p><p>The Emperor sky divine guards ‘law enforcement team had arrived.</p><p>who dares to kill people in the thousand stars city?!</p><p>A furious roar came from the red-robed middle-aged man who was the leader.</p><p>The burly man was a Lv 5 martial King and his aura was as heavy as a mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
