Many people looked forward to the battle between Shura and Yama.</p><p>...</p><p>This was because the two of them had a lot in common. They both wore masks, and from their voices, they were both very young and had both risen to power recently.</p><p>Many people guessed that the two of them were peerless heaven’s favorites from the outside world, and were even on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>However, hell King had not appeared since the battle with old monster Qi Chan.</p><p>In the next two days, when Lu Ming continued to fight, no one challenged him.</p><p>Once, when he challenged someone, the other party admitted defeat and gave him 1000000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Lu Ming, accompany me in battle!”</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the inn, Xie nianqing appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Accompany you in battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve reached the threshold of the fusion of the two wills, but I’m still short of an external pressure. However, the Warriors on the life battle platform are too weak to give me that kind of pressure, so I can only find you.</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not reject the opportunity to help Xie nianqing cultivate.</p><p>The two of them left the city and appeared in the sky above a barren mountain tens of thousands of miles away. The two of them stood opposite each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s will of destruction and will of wind burst out at the same time. They intertwined and turned into a green palm print, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the void trembled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist radiance and the palm print collided.</p><p>With a loud boom, the palm print trembled, but the fist radiance disappeared.</p><p>“I don’t have enough strength. Lu Ming, increase your strength!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was heard as his aura gushed out.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the true war Dragon technique and the vital essence in his body began to mobilize rapidly. BOOM! A fist radiance that seemed to be able to connect heaven and earth, combined with the concept of fire, blasted towards Xie nianqing’s palm.</p><p>With a loud bang, Xie nianqing’s palm print exploded. However, Lu Ming did not hold back. He threw a second punch, a third punch, and a series of punches. One after another, the fist radiance pierced through the void and headed toward Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted as he struck out with both his palms. Black palm prints that were infused with the will of destruction and the will of wind were sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The void was boiling, and there were constant violent explosions in the air.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>In the beginning, the two of them were still testing each other, but gradually, their strength continued to increase and increase.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his fists and the speed of his punches became faster and faster. In an instant, dozens of fist gleams burst out.</p><p>Xie nianqing, on the other hand, was trying to combine the two mentalities.</p><p>“Yes, that’s it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes brightened.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely at ease as he continued to bombard his fists with radiance.</p><p>Xie nianqing was strong enough to block the attack. Lu Ming was not worried that he would hurt Xie nianqing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a hundred moves had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the explosive star fist was circulating more and more smoothly. His understanding of the explosive star fist was also slowly deepening.</p><p>At the same time, the exploding star fist was like a sledgehammer, continuously tempering Xie nianqing’s intent realm, causing the two intents to slowly merge.</p><p>If Xie nianqing could successfully merge the two intents, her combat strength would definitely increase by a large margin.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than 300 moves before stopping.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and asked.</p><p>yes, I’m very touched. I believe that I’ll be able to make a breakthrough in a while.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded excitedly and smiled at Lu Ming. “You’re helping me so much. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll break through and suppress you?”</p><p>“Haha, even if you have a breakthrough, you might not be able to suppress me. Furthermore, I will also improve. In this lifetime, you will never be able to surpass me.”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed, feeling smug.</p><p>you’re so full of yourself. Hmph, let’s see how I’ll surpass you.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Then, the two of them chatted as they walked back.</p><p>For the next two days, Lu Ming did not go to the life battle platform. Instead, he went into seclusion to cultivate.</p><p>Two days later, a piece of news came out.</p><p>Old monster demonic wind wants to challenge Asura on the life battle platform.</p><p>The news shook the entire city.</p><p>Demonic wind was also an old monster who had lived for a long time, at least five hundred years old. A few hundred years ago, he was already a peak King. Although he hadn’t broken through to the sea of soul realm, his martial skills, secret techniques, and other aspects had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>Everyone was extremely curious and excited that such a person wanted to challenge a Shura.</p><p>Therefore, the news reached Lu Ming’s ears very quickly.</p><p>“Demonic wind, interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>“It seems that an expert has appeared. Let’s go, I’ll accompany you to take a look!”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked over, and the two of them walked towards the life battle stage. On the way, they changed into black robes and put on masks.</p><p>“The Shura is here!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, everyone exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>The surroundings of the battle stage were already filled with people.</p><p>After all, the Shura’s name was becoming more and more famous recently, almost as famous as the King of Hell.</p><p>As for demonic wind, he was a famous old monster in the sea near golden sand island. Apart from sea of soul realm experts, no one would dare to offend him.</p><p>The battle between the two had naturally attracted the interest of the vast majority of people. Many people had rushed over as soon as they had heard the news.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and landed on the fighting ring. Countless eyes were on him.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>A shriveled sneer was heard, and a thin old man in a green robe appeared on the fighting ring. Many people did not even see how he appeared.</p><p>“What a fast speed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. It was obvious that demonic wind had cultivated the wind concept. His speed was terrifyingly fast.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the stands, Luo Xin’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Today, Luo Xin had also come. Similarly, Chen Dao and Chen Zhao had also arrived and were sitting together to watch.</p><p>“I hope demonic wind can kill this kid!”</p><p>Chen Zhao secretly prayed.</p><p>“You’re the Shura? I heard that it’s just a little kid. Don’t play tricks in front of this old man, take off your mask!”</p><p>The demonic wind old monster stood in front of Lu Ming and chuckled.</p><p>“If you want me to take off my mask, sure, but let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s good for young people to be confident, but it’s also not good to look down on seniors. After all, age isn’t for nothing.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he disappeared.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming felt a strong gust of wind in front of him. A claw was grabbing at his mask.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming took a step back and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Hehe, you can’t escape!”</p><p>Demonic wind moved again and followed Lu Ming closely, his claws reaching for Lu Ming’s mask.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly threw a punch forward.</p><p>At such a close distance, it was impossible for anyone else to avoid it, but old monster demonic wind dodged it with a flash.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
