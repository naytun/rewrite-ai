That poisonous snake kept absorbing the young man’s mental energy fire.</p><p>The flames of the young man’s three mind lamps quickly dimmed, especially the flame of the third lamp, which was on the verge of being extinguished.</p><p>It was no wonder that the young man had said that his mental fire was weakening and that his cultivation of the mental fire was not advancing but regressing instead.</p><p>He played this game with Yun Haitang every day, so it would be strange if he didn’t leave.</p><p>Moreover, he had not noticed it at all.</p><p>Yun Haitang was using this method to cultivate her mental energy fire. Lu Ming felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>This process only took about a dozen breaths of time. The mental energy fire above their heads had hidden and disappeared.</p><p>The young man was like a pile of mud, lying limply on the ground.</p><p>“You rest here for a while, I still have something to deal with!”</p><p>Yun Haitang said to the young man.</p><p>The young man nodded.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming quietly retreated from the stone Hall and returned to the stone Hall from before. He poured himself a glass of wine and slowly sipped it.</p><p>Not long after, the sound of footsteps could be heard. Yun Haitang had returned.</p><p>“Brother Lu, sorry to keep you waiting!”</p><p>Yun Haitang said in a sweet voice as she walked over.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but shiver at the thought of the scene just now. He was not in the mood to admire it at all. He only said perfunctorily,”I didn’t wait long, you’re pretty fast!”</p><p>He did feel that the old man was quite fast.</p><p>Yun Haitang smiled faintly and sat down beside Lu Ming. She poured a glass of wine for him and another for herself.”Brother Lu, I’ll drink a cup as punishment!”</p><p>Then, he picked up his wine cup and drank it all.</p><p>After putting down the wine glass, Yun Haitang blinked her big eyes and stared at Lu Ming. After a while, she said, ” brother Lu, I’ve invited you here today because I have something to tell you!</p><p>“Oh? What did he say?” Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s face blushed as she inched closer to Lu Ming and placed her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>actually, the first time I saw brother Lu, I thought you were the man I’ve been waiting for my whole life. I’ve been missing you a lot recently!</p><p>With that, Yun Haitang was about to sit on Lu Ming’s lap. Her fragrance assailed his nose.</p><p>No man would be able to resist the temptation of such a rare beauty like Yun Haitang.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not seen that scene just now, he might have been tempted.</p><p>But at this moment, he didn’t feel anything at all. He said indifferently, ” “In my opinion, you don’t miss me, but my mental energy fire!”</p><p>His calm and indifferent voice made Yun Haitang’s movements freeze. Her body, which had almost sat on Lu Ming’s lap, froze in the air.</p><p>There was an ugly smile on her face. She looked at Lu Ming and said in a tender voice, ” “Brother Lu, what are you saying? I don’t understand what you’re talking about!”</p><p>there’s a problem that I have to correct you. I’m younger than you, and you’re calling me little sister. It’s embarrassing.</p><p>Lu Ming said very seriously.</p><p>“Hehe, so it’s little brother. I thought you were older than me.”</p><p>Yun Haitang’s face froze for a moment, then she smiled again.</p><p>one more thing. After you left, I was bored, so I walked around and happened to see the wonderful scene between you and that young master. Hehe, I wonder what will happen if this scene gets out? ”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s expression changed completely. She became extremely gloomy, and her eyes revealed a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Little brother, it’s not good to walk around in other people’s territory. You’ll have to pay with your life.”</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Yun Haitang’s fingers were like sharp swords, aimed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Her hand was originally on Lu Ming’s shoulder, and they were too close. Yun Haitang was 100% confident that she could kill Lu Ming with this move.</p><p>However, the next moment, her 100% confidence turned into zero.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s hand had already grabbed her wrist.</p><p>She did not even know how Lu Ming had managed to grab her wrist. Even with her cultivation at the peak of the eighth level of the martial King realm, she did not feel anything.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In an instant, a short sword appeared in her other hand and she slashed it at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>However, at the next moment, her hand was grabbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed her wrists and a terrifyingly powerful vital essence surged into Yun Haitang’s body. Yun Haitang’s body went soft and her vital energy dissipated. She had no strength to resist.</p><p>Her heart sank.</p><p>“Who are you? What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Yun Haitang cried out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too terrifying. It was far above his.</p><p>“Nothing much? I just want to take your inscription plate. If I can get rid of evil for the people, I don’t mind helping you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You … You killed Yun congsheng, didn’t you?” Yun Haitang asked.</p><p>“It can be considered so!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Y-you … The Yun family’s ancestor won’t let you off if you do this.”</p><p>Yun Haitang called out.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and murderous intent filled the air.</p><p>“Miss!” At this moment, a few maidservants heard the commotion and rushed in. Lu Ming flicked his fingers and a Spear’s gleam shot out, piercing through the maidservants ‘dantians and crippling their cultivation. He also sealed their ability to speak, preventing them from speaking for the time being.</p><p>Feeling the cold killing intent from Lu Ming, Yun Haitang was scared. Her face turned pale and she begged, ” “Lu Ming, brother Lu, I’m begging you, please let me go. I can give you anything you want. Furthermore, I’ll serve you well until you’re comfortable. I guarantee you’ll be satisfied!”</p><p>The implied meaning was self-evident.</p><p>“I don’t need it anymore!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>With that, he moved like the wind and pointed at Yun Haitang’s dantian.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s breathing current collapsed, and she fell to the ground like a pile of mud. Her eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming tapped Yun Haitang’s glabella a few times. Five spirit lamps appeared above Yun Haitang’s head. The spirit lamps swayed a few times and then collapsed one by one.</p><p>Yun Haitang’s cultivation and Dao of inscription had been completely destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming used his essential core to take Yun Haitang’s storage ring and held it in his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Kill Me if You Can. Otherwise, I won’t let you off.”</p><p>Yun Haitang let out a venomous cry.</p><p>“You will never be able to pose a threat to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Yun Haitang, his tone full of confidence.</p><p>Yun Haitang was nothing to him. Furthermore, she was a person who had lost her cultivation and her Dao of inscription.</p><p>With a flick of his finger, a burst of vital essence flew out and sealed Yun Haitang’s acupuncture points, making her unable to speak. Then, Lu Ming left Begonia courtyard in a flash and went to Xie nianqing’s dormitory.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
