Their bodies were suffused with blood-red light, and even their bloodlines had erupted.</p><p>The powerful vital essence merged with the will of heaven and earth and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still did not move.</p><p>The two big men’s faces turned red.</p><p>Most of the People’s faces changed.</p><p>“What are the two of you doing? Do you want to play games?”</p><p>Mu Zheng smiled faintly and looked at mu Yi.</p><p>Mu Yi’s face darkened.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Mu Tian, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke.</p><p>“This little bastard!”</p><p>His mother in the Holy Star City gritted her teeth, and her face turned even colder.</p><p>The people of sacred glory were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Sacred constellation, is this the battle you promised me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the sacred constellation in disdain.</p><p>“You want to fight me? let’s see if you have the qualifications!”</p><p>Holy constellation said calmly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His essential core suddenly exploded and he waved his arms.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two burly men were lifted up and slammed into each other.</p><p>A series of crackling sounds rang out, and the two burly men screamed in pain. It was unknown how many of their bone armors had been broken.</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arms and the two burly men’s bodies were thrown hundreds of meters away like two pools of mud. They lay on the ground and screamed in pain.</p><p>Many people’s faces changed.</p><p>The two burly men were both at the early stage of the LV 9 martial King realm. In the Tianxuan region, they were definitely the top experts and overlords. However, in the hands of Lu Ming, they seemed so weak and could not resist at all.</p><p>In just half a year’s time, Lu Ming had actually grown to this stage? Isn’t that too terrifying?</p><p>A hint of surprise also flashed across Holy constellation’s eyes.</p><p>“Hahaha! This kid is not bad. He’s worthy of being someone from the East!”</p><p>Mu Zheng laughed.</p><p>Before this, he had been ridiculed by mu Yi. Now that he had finally found a chance to counterattack, he felt very proud.</p><p>Hmph, I’ve only defeated two early stage Lv 9 martial King realm cultivators. Moreover, those two were caught off guard and didn’t even display any martial skills. What’s there to be proud of? compared to the Holy star, I don’t know how far they’re from it!</p><p>Mu Yi’s face was dark and he snorted coldly.</p><p>“He’s only an early Lv 9 martial King realm warrior? Hehe, second brother’s standards are really high. You don’t even take a Lv 9 martial King seriously.”</p><p>Mu Zheng said with a smile.</p><p>This time, mu Yi’s face darkened and he did not speak.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the sacred constellation and said only three words, but it made everything clear.</p><p>Didn’t the sacred constellation want to see if he was qualified? What about now?</p><p>“Too weak!”</p><p>Holy constellation’s reply was only two words, but it showed great confidence.</p><p>“You’re avoiding the battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at the Holy star.</p><p>what a joke. Little bastard, you are not qualified to fight with the young master of Xingchen. If you want to fight, you have to get past me first!</p><p>Hmph! a cold sneer was heard as a figure stepped into the air and strolled in the air before appearing in the square.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. There was no need to explain what it meant to walk in the air in Tianxuan city.</p><p>“It’s the sacred glory!”</p><p>he’s going to make a move! He’s an elder of the Tianxuan sub-Palace!</p><p>that’s normal. Lu Ming wants to challenge the sacred constellation today. He has to prove himself with his own abilities!</p><p>Countless people were whispering in the surroundings.</p><p>Many of them were powerhouses who had rushed over from other places in the Tianxuan region. They had never seen Lu Ming before. At this moment, they were curiously sizing up this outstanding young man.</p><p>It had been a few years since anyone from the younger generation of the Tianxuan region had challenged the sacred constellation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes fell on the sacred glory, and a sharp glint flashed in his eyes. He smiled and said, ” “Alright, it’s time to settle your score.”</p><p>“Settle accounts with me? Little bastard, I haven’t seen you for half a year. I don’t know where you got your confidence from.”</p><p>Sacred light sneered and stepped forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura of a peak-tier King exploded forth like a vast ocean.</p><p>Sheng Yao’s body also floated in the air. He looked down at Lu Ming and said, ” ten moves, I’ll suppress you in ten moves. If I can’t suppress you in ten moves, I’ll admit defeat!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and stretched out three fingers.</p><p>Shengyao was stunned for a moment, then sneered and said, ” “What’s wrong? If you don’t have any confidence in yourself, could it be that you can only withstand three of my moves?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head again. three moves. I mean I can defeat you within three moves. Otherwise, I’ll admit defeat and leave!</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place boiled.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that he could suppress the sacred glory within three moves. How was that possible?</p><p>Crazy, he was definitely crazy.</p><p>hehe, I thought he was a top figure, but it turns out he’s just a hothead who overestimates himself. Does he know what peak-tier King tiers mean? ”</p><p>Mu Yi sneered.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan and mu Zheng were also a little puzzled. They could not believe that Lu Ming could suppress the sacred glory in three moves.</p><p>On the high platform, mu Tian and Sheng Xingchen’s uncle, Sheng Xingchen’s father, the current head of the Sheng family, Sheng Cang, also shook their heads slightly.</p><p>With their cultivation, they could naturally tell that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the peak of the ninth level martial King realm.</p><p>Was it possible for a Lv 9 martial King to defeat a peak King in three moves?</p><p>“You … Suppress me in three moves? Hahaha!”</p><p>Shengyao laughed wildly as if he had heard something funny.</p><p>But the next moment, he could no longer laugh.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to have lost its weight. He was suspended in the air and flew to the same position as the sacred glory, standing opposite it.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>he’s hovering in the air. He’s hovering in Tianxuan city. Could it be that Lu Ming has already broken through to the peak-tier King tier? ”</p><p>Someone cried out in shock.</p><p>no, it’s a peak Lv 9 martial King. Lu Ming has comprehended the will of the wind, which is why he can fly. However, his combat strength is probably close to a peak Lv 9 martial King.</p><p>“Unbelievable! He can actually fight against a peak-tier King? How long has it been?”</p><p>“He’s so young!”</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>Mu Yi was dumbstruck, while mu Zheng and mu Xiu Yuan were stunned for a moment before they burst out laughing.</p><p>On the square, sacred constellation raised an eyebrow for the first time, showing a hint of interest.</p><p>However, he was only interested in it. He was still confident.</p><p>However, sacred light’s face was completely gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually hover in the sky above Tianxuan city. In a sense, Lu Ming was already on the same level as him.</p><p>make your move. Use your strongest unique skill. Otherwise, you won’t have the chance!</p><p>Lu Ming said. His voice was calm but full of confidence.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>attack! sacred light shouted, and his aura burst out. He suddenly attacked.</p><p>A huge flaming hand, completely formed by the flaming sword Qi, was a few meters long and wide. It was shockingly powerful as it came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, he opened his mouth and a ring of dazzling flames flew out. It expanded rapidly and became a few meters in diameter. It was filled with Crimson flames and bombarded Lu Ming.</p><p>The two attacks were as powerful as lightning, and the space was boiling from the heat.</p><p>Below, more than a dozen elders of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace waved their hands, and true origin spread out, forming a true origin barrier that isolated the area below.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
