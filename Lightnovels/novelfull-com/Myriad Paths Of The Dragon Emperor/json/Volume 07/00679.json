Two days off?”</p><p>...</p><p>Xie nianqing was dumbfounded, and then his face turned red.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t want to? Then forget it, let’s hurry and escape. Lu Ming’s body will definitely be taken over by the old man. Sigh!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Xie nianqing bit his lips and his face turned red. He gritted his teeth and said,”Alright, I … I’ve agreed, so you can leave now!”</p><p>“I’m leaving? No need, you guys can start. I’ll stay here and watch over you!”</p><p>Dandan said, her eyes darting around.</p><p>“Where’s the cultivation technique?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Cultivation technique? What cultivation technique?” Dandan answered subconsciously.</p><p>“That pair of … Cultivation technique!”</p><p>After that, Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed and he couldn’t help but take a few more looks at dandan. He saw dandan’s sneaky eyes rolling around and her mouth was grinning. She looked like she wanted to laugh but she was holding it in.</p><p>“Dandan, are you lying to me? You’re lying to me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened.</p><p>hahaha, little beauty, you’ve seen through me. Haha, I just wanted to see if you’re concerned about Lu Ming. I didn’t expect that I would be able to see through it with one try.</p><p>Dandan finally couldn’t hold it in and grinned.</p><p>“You … I’m going to eat you, you bastard!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and he gritted his teeth. He pounced over and grabbed dandan, wanting to take a bite.</p><p>Then, he cast a worried glance at Lu Ming and said,”Is Lu Ming really alright?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. That old man actually dared to set his eyes on Lu Ming. He’s simply courting death. Moreover, Lu Ming is going to obtain a great fortune. This kid’s luck is too good. Even I’m a little envious.”</p><p>Dandan said with a relaxed expression.</p><p>“Are you really fine?” Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>“Of course I’m fine, I’m absolutely fine!” She was very confident.</p><p>Then, it saw Xie nianqing’s eyes glint fiercely as he stared at it with gritted teeth.</p><p>Just now, he was actually fooled by dandan?</p><p>At the thought that she almost had a double break with Lu Ming, Xie nianqing’s heart raced and his face turned red. He wanted to find a hole to hide in.</p><p>“I wonder if that guy heard it? I don’t think you heard it!”</p><p>At the thought that Lu Ming might have heard it, Xie nianqing could not wait to braise dandan.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing? Why are you looking at me like that? I’m doing this for your own good, you know? In any case, you’ll have to do it sooner or later, so it’s better to do it as soon as possible. Young people like to procrastinate, this Lord is anxious to see it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Who wants to do it with that fellow … Did that kind of thing? Old turtle, I … Burn!”</p><p>A ball of flame appeared in Xie nianqing’s hand and enveloped dandan.</p><p>nest, it’s a murder. No, it’s a turtle. Help!</p><p>Dandan shouted, and her four heads shrank into the turtle shell. The turtle shell glowed and blocked the flames.</p><p>At this moment, a huge battle was going on in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>“How is that possible? Earth core flowing flame, your mental energy fire was ignited by earth core flowing flame.”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist shrieked in fear.</p><p>At this moment, the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire was completely wrapped in yellow flames.</p><p>Earlier, when the seven-colored Daoist entered, he wanted to extinguish Lu Ming’s mental energy fire and then replace it.</p><p>However, he would never have dreamed that the essence of Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was the core flowing flame.</p><p>The earth core flowing flame was an extremely powerful flame. It was one of the most powerful flames in the world. Not only did the seven-colored Daoist fail to extinguish Lu Ming’s mental energy fire, but he was also surrounded by it.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist shouted. His purple mental energy fire transformed back into his human form. He waved his hands and a purple combat sword appeared, trying to break through the encirclement of Lu Ming’s mental energy fire.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming’s mental energy fire suddenly transformed into a huge underworld God. It held a long spear and stabbed at the seven-colored Daoist.</p><p>This was the underworld God formed by the underworld God meditation. At this moment, Lu Ming was using the underworld God meditation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist’s combat sword was destroyed, but the spear didn’t stop and continued to stab the seven-colored Daoist.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was shattered, turning into a ball of purple flames that drifted backward before condensing back together.</p><p>mental fire cultivation method! You’ve actually mastered the mental fire cultivation method!</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist shrieked hysterically. His voice was filled with endless fear, and he seemed to be even more terrified than when he first heard about the earth core flowing flame.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The god of the underworld exuded a terrifying aura as he strode forward and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist turned into a stream of light and ran.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going in my knowledge sea?”</p><p>In the next moment, the god of the underworld appeared in front of the seven-colored Daoist and thrust his spear. With a pfft, the seven-colored Daoist was shattered again, turning into a ball of flames.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, he was the master here. He had complete control over this place. How could the seven-colored Daoist escape?</p><p>This time, the seven-colored Daoist took a longer time to re-condense the drifting flames.</p><p>“Spare me, young hero, spare me!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist began to beg for mercy the moment he was formed.</p><p>“You wanted to kill me just now, and now you want me to spare you? Is that even possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Young hero, as long as you spare me, I can teach you alchemy and the method of inscribing formations. I can grasp all my experience and teach you!”</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist called out.</p><p>“Hehe, I’m not at ease facing an old monster like you. I’m more at ease when you’re dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not moved at all. He continued to thrust his spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The flames continued to be scattered.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned into a ball of flame again and surrounded the seven-colored Daoist’s purple flame, burning it wildly.</p><p>The seven-colored Daoist shrieked miserably. His soul and consciousness were being burned by the earth core flowing flame and were slowly dissipating.</p><p>No matter how he begged for mercy and cursed, Lu Ming was unmoved.</p><p>A moment later, the seven-colored Daoist’s voice disappeared completely. His consciousness had been completely refined by Lu Ming, leaving only a ball of pure mental energy fire.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At that moment, the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire was being burned and refined. Wisps of it actually drifted toward Lu Ming’s mental energy lamp.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming had only lit up eight yellow spirit lamps. However, at that moment, the first eight lamps continued to burn while the ninth lamp suddenly emitted a flame.</p><p>Although it was just a small flame, it meant that Lu Ming had lit the ninth lamp.</p><p>A rank 3 Alchemist would have nine lamps. He was only one lamp away from perfect.</p><p>Moreover, as the earth core flowing flame continued to burn and refine the seven-colored Daoist’s Spirit Fire, the flame of the ninth spirit lamp began to light up quickly and the flame became more and more intense.</p><p>It was 108000 times faster than when he was cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic and extremely excited.</p><p>He could actually refine the seven-colored Daoist’s mental energy fire and use it to improve his own.</p><p>A blessing in disguise, this was simply a blessing in disguise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
