Bang!</p><p>At this moment, seven to eight figures suddenly flew out from the surrounding soil.</p><p>“Why are you talking so much nonsense? There are only two Jade swords left. Kill them directly and don’t let the last one with the Jade sword discover you. Finish the battle quickly and clean up the scene!”</p><p>One of the white-haired and white-bearded elders spoke. His body emitted a powerful cultivation-the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>This elder had a cultivation at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>These people were all from the same force. It was obvious that the people who had come here before had been killed by them in a thunderous manner. That was why Lu Ming had not noticed them even after coming here several times.</p><p>is Jian feiliu also dead? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. It was a pity that such a genius had died in the hands of these people.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I can give you the Jade sword, but you have to let us go!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, pulling Xie nianqing and moving to the side. Every time he moved, a faint light would enter the ground under his feet.</p><p>“Alright, hand over the Jade swords of your own accord, and I can consider sparing your lives!”</p><p>The burly man sneered.</p><p>The others revealed mocking smiles. This kid was really naive. How could they possibly go around them?</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>These people were all experts. Of the seven that appeared later, two were peak King tiers, and the other five were all experts of the spiritual ocean tier. The strongest was naturally that white-haired elder, who was at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>He was definitely someone from a big force. This force was stronger than the entire golden sand island.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He moved his hand and the Jade sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core exploded and the Jade sword in his hand turned into a bolt of lightning, shooting towards the white-haired elder at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The white-haired old man subconsciously reached out to take it.</p><p>This was the moment that Lu Ming wanted.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly took two steps on the ground. Instantly, the ground glowed with a brilliant light. Countless inscriptions burst out and turned into two combat swords, slashing toward the South.</p><p>There were only two first level spiritual ocean tier martial artists in the South. Out of the four directions, that side was the weakest.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to break out of the encirclement to the South.</p><p>“Damn it, inscription formation, when did he inscribe the inscription formation?”</p><p>A furious roar rang out, and everyone exploded with a powerful aura.</p><p>But he was still too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>How could those two sea of soul realm experts have thought that two mere peak tier Kings would dare to attack and inscribe a large inscription formation without them knowing?</p><p>He wanted to block it in a hurry, but he could only use 50% of his strength.</p><p>It was cut in half by two combat swords.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming hugged Xie nianqing’s waist and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to rush South. In the blink of an eye, they were already ten miles away.</p><p>“Dammit! Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>The white-haired elder caught the Jade sword and let out an angry roar. He pointed his finger at Lu Ming.</p><p>A finger force crossed the distance of ten miles in an instant and was aimed at Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>Fast, too fast, and terrifyingly powerful. The fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier was simply too powerful.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field! Destroy!”</p><p>Xie nianqing tried his best to block it with the sky demon force field.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian burst out and his figure continued to Dodge to the side.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The powerful finger force pierced through Xie nianqing and Lu Ming’s defense. Although Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge, he was still a little too slow. His arm was grazed by the wind of the finger force, and a large piece of flesh was torn off. Lu Ming’s arm almost exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Runes flickered on Lu Ming’s body and entered his and Xie nianqing’s bodies. They were runes that sped up the process.</p><p>At the same time, runes flashed on Lu Ming’s body. This was the rune of a vital essence explosion.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could inscribe some of the inscriptions that dandan used in the past in an instant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and his speed was unbelievably fast. In an instant, he was far away.</p><p>Behind him, the white-haired elder, the burly man, and the others quickly caught up.</p><p>The killing intent on their bodies was so thick that it couldn’t be dispersed.</p><p>They had miscalculated. This time, they had miscalculated.</p><p>They were merely two peak-tier Kings. With their powerful battle-power, they were already cautious enough to surround two peak-tier Kings. This was simply a matter of certainty. Not even in their dreams did they think that the two of them would actually be able to rush out.</p><p>Last time, they had been careless and let a young man rush out. So this time, they all moved out and surrounded the two, but they still got out.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s inscription formation was too powerful. It could actually kill two experts at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier in an instant.</p><p>They chased after him with all their might but realized that Lu Ming’s figure was getting further and further away.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps was unleashed at full force. With the help of various inscription arrays, Lu Ming’s speed was unbelievably fast. Not long after, Lu Ming had already disappeared from the sight of the white-haired elder and the others.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The white-haired old man roared like a mad demon.</p><p>The burly man and the others appeared behind the white-haired old man with gloomy faces.</p><p>sect leader, that kid’s inscription Dao is too strong. He’s definitely a true inscription refiner, a rank 6 true inscription refiner. Otherwise, he can’t be so strong!</p><p>The muscular man said to the white-haired elder.</p><p>like I said, the younger you are, the more you have to go all out. The young geniuses these days are too strong. We were careless before and were pushed out by a kid. This time, these two young people are even more terrifying!</p><p>Old ou said.</p><p>the young man from before is fine. He was injured by you and my five poison palm, so he’s definitely dead. However, it’s a little troublesome if these two escape!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>alright. Although he has escaped, we have already obtained the Jade sword. Now, we are only missing the last Jade sword. We have to get it as soon as possible. Before the news spreads, we have to open the Martial Emperor’s treasure, get the treasure inside, and leave this place. This is the opportunity for our blood poison sect to rise again. We can’t let any accidents happen!</p><p>The white-haired old man said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Sect master, although the owner of the last Jade sword hasn’t said anything, I think he will be here soon. This time, we will definitely take him down!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>After that, everyone returned to the small island and continued to lay out their plans while waiting.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Xie nianqing along and flew for hundreds of thousands of miles before landing on a small island.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing was extremely worried and looked at Lu Ming with concern.</p><p>I’m fine. That finger force was poisonous. However, poison is useless to me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and controlled the nine Dragon bloodline to devour the poison on his arm.</p><p>After the poison was removed, the wound on his arm began to recover at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>After half a day, Lu Ming’s arm had completely recovered.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a breath of turbid air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
