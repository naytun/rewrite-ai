With one strike, more than a dozen tentacles were cut off.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useless. The tentacles would form immediately.</p><p>haha, it’s no use. The plan I’ve set up is foolproof. You can just wait for your death!</p><p>The blood-robed youth sneered.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and charge in the same direction.”</p><p>Xuan Feng, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>Bu Feifan and sun Chu both nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming also nodded.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s charge!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and used Phoenix Wing slash, rushing in the direction of the exit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!</p><p>Sword light, Saber Light, fist force, spear light …</p><p>They gathered together and rushed towards the exit. In an instant, more than 100 tentacles were destroyed.</p><p>Before the tentacles could recover, they had already covered a distance of a few hundred meters.</p><p>“Use all your power to control the formation and stop them!”</p><p>The blood-robed youth’s expression changed as he shouted angrily.</p><p>The hundred or so young men from the Dragon burial pool shouted in unison. Their true Qi surged, and runes appeared in their hands, which were then plunged into the ground.</p><p>Instantly, more tentacles rushed out from the area surrounding Lu Ming and the others. They were densely packed and kept winding around them.</p><p>Even if they worked together, they wouldn’t be able to get out.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the blood-robed young man shouted coldly and rushed into the formation.</p><p>His body technique was like a ghost, flashing among the tentacles, but the tentacles ignored him.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The blood-robed youth’s claw was as red as blood and his target was Huang chixuan.</p><p>Huang chixuan was obviously injured, so he had to deal with him first.</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and used the Phoenix Wing slash, clashing with the blood-robed youth’s claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s body trembled and he staggered back.</p><p>The blood-robed young man’s body flashed and disappeared into the blood-red tentacles. Bu Feifan and the others wanted to help but they were too late.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a few flashes, the blood-robed young man appeared behind Huang chixuan. His blood-red Claws, like the claws of a Blood Dragon, grabbed at Huang chixuan.</p><p>Huang chixuan fought back with all his might.</p><p>It had to be said that the blood robed youth’s own strength was extremely terrifying, no weaker than Huang chixuan at his peak.</p><p>Huang chixuan was no match for him at all, and with the tentacles wrapping around him, Huang chixuan was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>After a few consecutive moves, Huang chixuan’s body shook violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>At this moment, a tentacle wrapped around Huang chixuan.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and struggled with all his might, but he could only break free from a few tentacles. Around him, there were more tentacles that wrapped around him.</p><p>“No, save me!”</p><p>Huang chixuan panicked and shouted in horror.</p><p>“Slash, slash!”</p><p>Bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and the others used all their strength to save him.</p><p>Usually, they would wish for the other party to die, but now, they were all in the same boat. One less person meant one less force.</p><p>“If you still want to save him, take care of yourself first!”</p><p>The blood robed youth sneered, his figure flashed and rushed towards bu Feifan, exchanging a few moves with him, neither of them winning.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Huang chixuan screamed. His body was rapidly shriveling and his blood was being sucked out.</p><p>“Save me, save me!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared, full of unwillingness and fear.</p><p>After a few breaths, his scream stopped abruptly, and he turned into a dried corpse.</p><p>Huang chixuan, the strongest person in a super region, a rare four-battle genius, died in this place, turning into a dry corpse.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Screams kept coming from all directions. At this time, less than 100 of the hundreds of people had died. Most of the blood of the young experts had been absorbed.</p><p>After absorbing the blood of so many young geniuses, the power of the Grand burial array had become even more terrifying. The entire cave was filled with blood-red tentacles.</p><p>At this moment, the tentacles were actually merging together.</p><p>The power of the tentacles was even more terrifying.</p><p>Even Lu Ming and the group found it difficult to defeat them.</p><p>As for the remaining one hundred or so young men, they were wrapped up by the tentacles in just a few breaths.</p><p>Miserable shrieks continued to ring out as the Grand burial formation became even more frenzied.</p><p>Only Lu Ming, bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and Xuan Feng were left in the formation.</p><p>At this moment, bu Feifan and sun Chu were terrified.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, while Xuan Feng’s face was cold.</p><p>haha, only the four of you are left. All of you can die!</p><p>The blood-robed youth laughed.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming turned around and took a step forward.</p><p>This step was not in the direction of the exit, but in the opposite direction of the exit, in the direction of the pitch-black darkness.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The seven to eight tentacles crumbled. Lu Ming rushed forward and whipped out his long spear. The power of wind and Fire combined and destroyed the three tentacles that were coming at him.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Bu Feifan roared.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming actually dashed in the opposite direction. It was fine if he was courting death, but their strength had been weakened.</p><p>Sun Chu’s expression was also extremely ugly. Only Xuan Feng’s expression did not change.</p><p>Even the blood-robed youth was stunned.</p><p>“Is this kid stupid?” The blood-robed youth sneered.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word and continued to rush inside.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that kid, we’ll charge at full speed!”</p><p>Bu Feifan shouted angrily.</p><p>The three of them worked together and kept charging outside.</p><p>Hmph, that brat is charging in. That’s a dangerous place, and only death awaits him. Use all your power to control the formation and deal with those three people!</p><p>The blood-robed youth instructed.</p><p>At that moment, more than a hundred young men from the Dragon burial pool controlled the Grand formation and sent more tentacles towards bu Feifan and the others.</p><p>In this way, the number of tentacles in front of Lu Ming decreased by several times and the pressure was greatly reduced.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming blasted out a few heaven’s path palm prints in a row, crushing a large number of tentacles in front of him. Lu Ming charged forward at top speed.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to rush out of the array and enter the dark place.</p><p>The blood-robed youth’s eyes flashed as he muttered, no, this kid’s behavior is strange. He might have something to rely on. Stop him first!</p><p>In a flash, the blood-robed young man’s body was like a ghost. With a few flashes, he appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man shouted coldly and his blood-red Claw reached out to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>The strong wind whistled and was filled with the smell of blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear forward and it collided with the blood-red Claw radiance. A powerful force surged forth and Lu Ming could not help but take two steps back.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took a step forward.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, none of you can leave the formation. All of you will become my nourishment and help me cultivate the divine technique!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man shouted coldly. He struck out with his blood-red Claw and collided with Lu Ming’s foot.</p><p>Then, the two of them took three steps back.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly patted the stone egg.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan turned around and turned into the size of a human head, flying forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
