Whether it was status or cultivation, they were many times higher than him.</p><p>He simply couldn’t compare to these people.</p><p>The Sheng clan was the most ancient clan in the entire Tianxuan region. It was also one of the two strongest clans in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>One was from the Sheng family, and the other was from the MU family.</p><p>The Sheng clan was located in the middle of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The center of the Tianxuan region was the most fertile, vast, and rich place in the entire Tianxuan region.</p><p>The area of the central part of the Tianxuan region was ten times the size of the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. There were many talented people and monstrous talents.</p><p>That place was the core of the entire Tianxuan region.</p><p>The young men in front of him were from the direct line of descent of the Sheng family. They were not people Sheng Wushuang could offend.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang, don’t worry. Although you’re a piece of trash, you’re still a member of the Sheng family. Even if you’re a dog of the Sheng family, we’ll make you pay ten times the price if you get bullied. Don’t worry, we’ll avenge you.</p><p>A young man said with a smile.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s face turned even uglier. What did he mean? Was he being compared to a dog?</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, it’s all your fault. It’s all your fault. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have suffered such great humiliation. I won’t let you off.”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang roared in his heart.</p><p>He did not dare to offend the direct descendant of the Sheng family. He could only blame everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, brother Sheng, and the other heroes, let’s go in first and catch up!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Sheng Yao nodded.</p><p>Immediately, the group of people came to the Thunder Palace. Someone had already prepared the spiritual tea and spiritual fruits.</p><p>Everyone took their seats.</p><p>“Brother Sheng, may I know why you have come this time? This Zheng might be able to help!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was the first to speak.</p><p>I’m not happy with brother Zheng. This time, I’m mainly here to do something that the young master of Xingchen has entrusted me with.</p><p>Sheng Yao said.</p><p>“What? The young master of Xingchen!”</p><p>Hearing that, both Thunder Palace Master and Sheng Wushuang’s expressions changed.</p><p>Sheng Xingchen was the number one genius among the younger generation of the Sheng family. He was a peerless monster.</p><p>At the age of 21, he had reached the martial King realm and shocked the entire Tianxuan region.</p><p>I wonder what is on the eastern part of the Tianxuan region that the young master of Xingchen is concerned about? ”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master asked.</p><p>it’s not a big deal. Young master Xingchen is mainly looking for someone, and then he asked us to bring this person to the central region!</p><p>Sheng Yao said.</p><p>“Looking for someone? Young master of Xingchen, who are you looking for?”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master asked.</p><p>we don’t know either. Therefore, we will need the help of Thunder Palace Master! Sheng Yao said.</p><p>“I’ll definitely do my best. Do you have any clues?” Thunder Palace Master immediately looked like he was going all out.</p><p>“Brother Zheng, you should know about Palace Master MU’s daughter, miss Mu Lan, right?” Sheng Yao said.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s expression changed again, and he said, ” of course I know about Palace Master MU’s daughter, miss Mu Lan. I also heard that miss Mu Lan had an engagement with the young master of constellation since she was young.</p><p>The palace Master they were talking about was not the palace Master of the eastern Palace in the Tianxuan region, but the palace Master of the entire Palace in the Tianxuan region.</p><p>that’s right, but that girl Mu Lan has never wanted to marry young master Xingchen. She even ran away from home and hid in a remote place like the cloud Emperor mountain range. However, she actually went back some time ago. Young master Xingchen has already sent people to investigate. That girl Mu Lan actually went back because she wanted to ask for an invitation to the Ditian Divine Guard selection on behalf of someone!</p><p>this is the person that young master Xingchen is looking for. The person that Mu Lan asked for an invitation for is from the burning sun Empire in the cloud Emperor mountain range. I heard that he has already joined the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>Holy light explained.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s face revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>“Brother Sheng, I know this person. His name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>There were two Ditian divine guards from the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Qiu changkong was definitely not one of them. Lu Ming was the only one left.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Hearing that, Sheng Wushuang’s face changed.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is this Lu Ming very famous?”</p><p>A young man from the Sheng family asked.</p><p>everyone, this Lu Ming is the East heaven Divine Guard from the East of the Tianxuan region. He’s also the one who injured Sheng Wushuang!</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master explained.</p><p>He was overjoyed.</p><p>He had been thinking of how to use the Sheng family to get rid of Lu Ming. Now, he realized that he did not have to do anything and the Sheng family would not let Lu Ming off.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to die this time.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master thought coldly in his heart.</p><p>so it’s the same person. Haha, that’s good too. It saves us trouble. I’ll teach him a lesson and cripple Lu Ming’s cultivation. Then, I’ll bring him back to the central region and hand him over to the young master of Star Palace to deal with!</p><p>One of the young men with sword-shaped eyebrows laughed.</p><p>everyone, don’t underestimate Lu Ming. His combat strength is terrifying. Not long ago, he defeated a genius who had just broken through to the martial King realm when he was only half a step away from the martial King realm!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t mention that the martial king who was defeated was his disciple, because it was really embarrassing.</p><p>“What? A half step King warrior actually defeated a martial King?”</p><p>The faces of Sheng Yao and the four geniuses of the Sheng family changed drastically.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can a half step King defeat a true king?”</p><p>The sword-browed young man couldn’t believe it.</p><p>it’s true. Sheng Wushuang was there and he saw it!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>that’s right. It’s true. Lu Ming’s combat strength is terrifying!</p><p>Sheng Wushuang said coldly.</p><p>a half-step King can actually defeat a King. Although he has just broken through, it’s still unbelievable. In that case, we can’t let this kid live. Saint Kong, Saint might, you two go together and cripple Lu Ming’s cultivation first. Then, take him down and bring him back to the central region.</p><p>Holy light ordered.</p><p>don’t worry, elder. No matter how strong Lu Ming is, he’s only a half-step King. I’ve already reached the early stage of the second level martial King realm, and my holy aura has reached the peak of the second level martial King realm. It’ll be a piece of cake to take him down!</p><p>The young man with sword-like eyebrows, Sheng Kong, said confidently.</p><p>Moreover, they were all geniuses, and their battle prowess was unparalleled among those of the same level. They could even fight those of a higher level.</p><p>“Lu Ming should be in the eastern sky courtyard. I’ll Take You There!</p><p>Sheng Wushuang said immediately.</p><p>At the thought of Lu Ming being beaten up like a dead dog, his heart trembled with excitement.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you hurt me and take away 30000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals from me? I’ll make you pay 10 times the amount!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang roared in his heart.</p><p>He immediately brought the Saint air and Saint might to the eastern heaven courtyard.</p><p>…</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming returned to the eastern sky courtyard, he sat cross-legged and thought about the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>now, my Thunder mentality is progressing very fast. It’s almost at the middle stage of level one lower tier. However, the progress of my Wind and Fire mentality is too slow. I must improve faster!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
