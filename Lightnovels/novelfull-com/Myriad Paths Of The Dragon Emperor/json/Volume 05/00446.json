I might as well use all of them to deepen my understanding of wind intent!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He continued to take out wind-type ultimacy crystals, crushed them, and started cultivating.</p><p>This time, there were even more tendrils of profound meaning that were absorbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The amount he absorbed was several times more than before.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had comprehended a sliver of intent realm of heaven and earth, and his intent realm absorption of intent realm crystals had also become stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of wind was also slowly deepening.</p><p>Lu Ming only ended his cultivation when he used up the last nine pieces of wind-attribute profound meaning crystals.</p><p>now, I can put aside the wind mentality for a while and start to comprehend the fire mentality. Also, I need to find time to start comprehending the Thunder Force!</p><p>in two days, the fire Palace Master will be conducting a lecture. I can’t miss it!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and continued cultivating.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming headed to the fire Palace.</p><p>Just like the wind Palace, there were a lot of people here, almost two thousand.</p><p>The layout of the palace of fire was very similar to that of the palace of wind. The main hall was filled with prayer mats.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in and sat down on a futon at random.</p><p>“That’s Lu Ming. He really came to the palace of fire.”</p><p>he really wants to cultivate Wind and Fire at the same time. He’s really overestimating himself!</p><p>I heard that a while ago, the wind Palace Master wanted to take him as a disciple, and the condition was that he had to specialize in wind concept. He actually rejected it!</p><p>“I’ve also heard of this matter. He’s really too arrogant. Just because he has a little bit of achievement, he’s already acting so high and mighty. He doesn’t even listen to the opinion of the hall Master.”</p><p>I think Sheng Wushuang is right. The distance between him and Sheng Wushuang will only grow further and further!</p><p>The other Ditian divine guards in the surroundings glanced at Lu Ming from time to time as they mumbled and discussed in low voices.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head after hearing that. He could not be bothered.</p><p>Walk your own path and let others say it.</p><p>He firmly believed that he would use his actions to shut these people up.</p><p>Very quickly, the palace Master of fire arrived.</p><p>The palace Master of fire was a tall old man. He wore a fiery red robe and had a powerful aura.</p><p>After he arrived, he swept his gaze across the room and paused for a moment on Lu Ming. He did not say much and began to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming listened attentively.</p><p>Three hours later, the explanation ended. Lu Ming felt that he had learned a lot.</p><p>After returning to the courtyard, Lu Ming began to cultivate non-stop.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming used up all five pieces of fire-type esoteric crystals.</p><p>However, it was a pity that he was still a little short. Lu Ming did not comprehend a trace of the concept of fire.</p><p>I still have one more chance to enter the hundred deities slope. I might as well put aside the wind-fire concept for now and start to comprehend the force of Thunder. When the force of Thunder is a little mature, I will enter the hundred deities slope and maximize the use of this precious spot!</p><p>moreover, the Thunder Palace Master is going to give a lecture tomorrow. I’ll go and listen.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming headed to the lightning Palace.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked into the Thunder Palace, he immediately caused a commotion.</p><p>“That’s Lu Ming. What is he doing here? Could it be that he still wants to comprehend Lightning Force?”</p><p>crazy, I think he’s crazy. Not only is he cultivating the force of Wind and Fire, he’s also trying to comprehend the force of Thunder. He’s really delusional!</p><p>he’s so stubborn. I don’t think he can even break through to the martial King realm!</p><p>The others were all discussing excitedly.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’ve really exceeded my expectations!”</p><p>A figure sat down beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Xiao!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This young man was Xiao Haoyu, who had been saved by Lu Ming in the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I don’t know what to say.”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered with what others were saying. He waited quietly.</p><p>After a while, an old man in a green robe walked up to the higher part of the hall and sat down cross-legged. Then, he looked around with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>When his gaze fell on Lu Ming, he was a little surprised. Then, a cold glint flashed across his eyes as he shouted coldly, ” “Lu Ming, what are you doing here at the lightning Palace? Get out!”</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>What was with this Thunder Palace Master? Even if he did not agree to Lu Ming cultivating the Thunder concept, he should not have berated him and asked him to get lost.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and cupped his fists. Hall Master Lei, I’m only here to listen to the class. There’s no rule in the Emperor heaven divine Palace that forbids me from listening to the class!</p><p>“Listen to class? Ridiculous. Who doesn’t know that you’re arrogant and overconfident? you want to cultivate the Wind and Fire essences together. What’s more ridiculous is that you came to the Thunder Hall to listen to the Thunder essence. You still want to comprehend the Thunder mentality? what a joke! Our Thunder Hall doesn’t welcome arrogant people like you!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master waved his sleeve and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed even more.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard that the master of the Thunder temple is Qiu changkong’s master!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu’s soft voice rang in her ears.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and came to a sudden realization.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew who the mysterious master behind Qiu changkong was. He knew who the Big Shot of the Empyrean divine Palace was.</p><p>It was actually the Thunder Palace Master, one of the nine Palace Masters.</p><p>It was no wonder that the master of the Thunder Palace had scolded Lu Ming as soon as he saw him. Lu Ming had found it strange at first, but everything made sense now.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold. Hall Master Lei, am I being too arrogant? it doesn’t seem to matter how many different types of intent realms I’ve cultivated. Furthermore, there are many experts in the world who have become unrivaled by cultivating multiple intent realms at the same time. What makes you think that I can’t do it? ”</p><p>“How dare you! What kind of attitude is this? How dare you speak to me like that?”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master shouted coldly and stood up suddenly. An unbelievably powerful aura burst out. It was as deep as the ocean and it was impossible to predict.</p><p>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz</p><p>Bolts of lightning flashed on Hall Master Lei’s body. His terrifying aura pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly let out a long howl. The nine Dragons ‘bloodline burst out, and Dragon roars were heard. A Spear’s gleam burst out to resist the aura.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt as if there was an archaic divine mountain weighing hundreds of millions of pounds pressing down on his head. The Spear’s radiance collapsed instantly, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Creak</p><p>Lu Ming’s body seemed to be groaning and his bones were creaking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming almost knelt down. He shouted and exerted force on his waist. He supported himself with his hands on the ground and barely managed to stay on his knees.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Who are you? You also dare to compare yourself with those unparalleled experts who have dominated the world. Those experts can cultivate several intent realms at the same time because they have that kind of talent. Do you have it?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master shouted coldly.</p><p>“I’ve already said that it’s my own business as to how many intent realms I want to cultivate. It has nothing to do with you. Old fellow, do you feel that you’ve lost face after your disciple Qiu changkong was defeated by me? As the palace Master of the Thunder Palace, you actually dare to attack me because of your own disciple’s incapability. Aren’t you ashamed of bullying the weak? I will report this matter to the palace Master.”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
