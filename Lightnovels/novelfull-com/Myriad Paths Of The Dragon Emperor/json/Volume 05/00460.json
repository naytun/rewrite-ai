Lu Ming shouted. He moved and clawed at Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>“Today, I have to hand it over even if I don’t want to!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>“You … Lu Ming, don’t think that I’m afraid of you. It’s just a cheating method. Kill!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang roared as a shocking aura exploded from his body.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was very close to the martial King realm. Whether it was the refinement of his vital essence or the comprehension of his will, he was very close to the martial King realm.</p><p>In particular, his combat strength was also very terrifying. He had actually reached the level of a five-battle genius.</p><p>The sword-shaped mark between his brows glowed, and an iron sword flew out into Sheng Wushuang’s hand.</p><p>With a slash of the sword, a vast sword gleam filled the world and slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was all in vain.</p><p>Three types of concepts were entwined around Lu Ming’s claws. The power was terrifying.</p><p>The sword gleam that Sheng Wushuang had slashed out was like a bubble in Lu Ming’s hands. He crushed it with a pinch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s claw did not stop moving. He grabbed Sheng Wushuang’s neck.</p><p>With a squeeze, majestic vital essence and the wind, fire, and Thunder concepts gushed into Sheng Wushuang. He could not resist at all. Lu Ming grabbed him by the neck and lifted him up like a chick.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw Sheng Wushuang’s body onto the fighting ring like a Toad.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the fighting ring had been hit by a meteorite, causing a violent roar and shaking.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>An ear-piercing sound was heard. It was the sound of Sheng Wushuang’s bones breaking.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s body hit the fighting ring and bounced up high. Then, he fell down again. He bounced a few times like a rubber ball before he stopped.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood spurted out of Sheng Wushuang’s mouth like it was free.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The people around them felt their teeth ache and their backs turn cold.</p><p>Lu Ming was too violent. He started a fight just because of a disagreement.</p><p>Most importantly, Sheng Wushuang, the so-called number one genius of the four heavens divine guards, could not even last one move against Lu Ming. He was like a real chick that could not put up any resistance.</p><p>But the two of them were clearly at the half-step King realm.</p><p>This was too shocking. The difference was too great. They were not even on the same level.</p><p>Not far away, Qiu changkong was trembling in fear. His face was drained of blood, and he almost peed his pants.</p><p>Even Sheng Wushuang could not withstand a single move from Lu Ming. If they were to deal with him, it would be no different from crushing an ant.</p><p>what number one genius of the four heavens divine guards? he’s just a piece of trash. How can such a trash be on par with me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Sheng Wushuang indifferently and said in disdain.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>This infuriated Sheng Wushuang so much that he spat out more blood.</p><p>“Hall Master, Hall Masters, Lu Ming has gone too far. He used despicable methods to defeat Xue Chao. He must be severely punished!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang shouted in pain.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master shouted coldly.</p><p>His voice wasn’t loud, but it silenced the entire place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he did not cheat!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master continued.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>“He didn’t cheat? how is that possible? He was clearly at a disadvantage earlier and was about to lose. If he didn’t cheat, how could he burst out with such a powerful force and defeat Xue Chao in one move? how is this possible?”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cheat, which meant that he had to lose 30000 best-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Are you doubting my words?”</p><p>The wind Palace master’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang felt cold all over and shouted, ” “No, I don’t dare to question the hall Master. It’s just that this matter is too strange. Lu Ming must give a reasonable explanation.”</p><p>“Reasonable explanation? The logical explanation is that Lu Ming had a breakthrough during the battle.”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said coldly.</p><p>With that said, he looked at Lu Ming again, a gentle smile immediately appearing on his face. He was deeply amazed as he said,”Lu Ming, in the battle just now, you’ve successfully fused the three intents of wind, fire, and lightning, right?”</p><p>“The hall master’s eyes are really sharp!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. He knew that he would not be able to hide this from the hall Masters.</p><p>“Recently, I’ve encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation. Then, I met this Xue Chao who wanted to find trouble with me. It just so happens that I’ll use him to practice my skills. I didn’t expect that I would really break through in an instant. Speaking of which, I have to thank him.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, his gaze shifting to Xue Chao.</p><p>At this moment, Xue Chao had already sobered up a bit. He struggled to get up, but after hearing these words, he immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, screamed, and fell to the ground unconscious.</p><p>That was anger.</p><p>The surrounding crowd was dumbstruck.</p><p>It turned out that the reason why Lu Ming challenged Xue Chao was to use him for cultivation.</p><p>Most importantly, it was one thing to use him for cultivation, but to make such a huge bet with him was too unkind.</p><p>But at the same time, they were also shocked by Lu Ming’s talent.</p><p>Different intents couldn’t be fused together just by a casual battle. If it were that simple, everyone would have gone to cultivate.</p><p>This was all because of Lu Ming’s abnormal talent.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Sheng Wushuang opened his mouth but could not squeeze out a word.</p><p>what about me? where are the spirit crystals? take them out quickly. If you agree to a bet, you must accept your loss.</p><p>Lu Ming walked to Sheng Wushuang’s side and looked down at him.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was on the verge of tears as his lips trembled.</p><p>30,000 spiritual crystals was almost all of his wealth. He had saved it to refine his vital essence and break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>How could he bear to do that?</p><p>Previously, he agreed to bet with Lu Ming because he thought that he would definitely win. He could earn 30000 spirit crystals for free. Why not?</p><p>If he had known that he would lose, he would not have gambled.</p><p>He looked at the various Palace Masters in the sky with a pleading look.</p><p>“If you agree to a bet, you must accept your loss. Give it!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said coldly.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s body trembled even more. He took out the jade box unwillingly and stared at it with a reluctant look.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and took the jade box away. He scanned it with his mind and found exactly 30000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals, not a single piece missing.</p><p>it’s only 30000 top-grade spiritual crystals. It’s not a big deal. Do you have to put on such an expression? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually and kept the jade box in the Supreme shrine happily. He felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was so angry that he spat out another mouthful of blood and his body trembled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were too infuriating. What did he mean by ‘what a big deal’? That was 30000 Supreme spiritual crystals, not 30000 lower spiritual crystals!</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s face was pale and he was in a state of extreme sadness.</p><p>In the past, he was so high and mighty. He looked as if he was giving advice to the world and gave Lu Ming advice like an elder giving advice to a junior. He said that Lu Ming was not worthy to be his opponent in the future and that his achievements would be limited if he cultivated several concepts at the same time.</p><p>But how long had it been? In front of Lu Ming, he was like a pug that could be toyed with at will.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, his expression back then was simply comical.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
