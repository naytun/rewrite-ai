The body of the cauldron seemed to be made of bronze, and there were some strange patterns carved on it. The body of the cauldron was densely covered with thunder and lightning, making a clattering sound.</p><p>It was a lightning cauldron!</p><p>The lightning cauldron hovered in front of Lu Ming as if it was sizing him up. Then, it flew a few rounds around him.</p><p>Instinctively, Lu Ming’s body exuded the force of lightning.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The lightning cauldron trembled slightly and suddenly crashed into Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He retreated instinctively but it was too late.</p><p>The lightning cauldron crashed into his forehead and disappeared in the next moment.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt the world shaking and his vision turned black. The next moment, he found himself in a hazy place. The fog was surging all around him and it was boundless.</p><p>A giant cauldron that was taller than a mountain floated in front of him, and a Thunder concept that was as vast as the ocean spread.</p><p>“Is he trying to break into my sea of consciousness?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He didn’t expect the lightning cauldron to rush into his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Let’s talk after we get out!”</p><p>Lu Ming focused his mind. The next moment, his mind left his sea of consciousness and returned to his physical body.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a desert, and peace had been restored here.</p><p>“Haha, that lightning cauldron actually ran into my spiritual sea. Does that mean it’s going to follow me? Also, let’s go and take a look at that terrifying Thunder concept!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine. He then focused and returned to the mist-filled area.</p><p>This place was his sea of consciousness.</p><p>The lightning cauldron hovered in the air, unmoving. However, the boundless lightning intent continued to surge forth in an extremely dense manner.</p><p>this Thunder mentality is too terrifying. Haha, I’m rich!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart.</p><p>He then called out to the lightning cauldron a few times, but it did not respond at all.</p><p>Although he did not see the weapon spirit of the lightning cauldron, Lu Ming was certain that it had a spirit. However, it did not have any reaction at all. It might have been injured by the heavenly Tribulation and needed to recover.</p><p>I don’t care anymore. I’ll first comprehend the Thunder concept!</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the lightning cauldron and sat down cross-legged, trying to comprehend the vast concept of lightning.</p><p>The Thunder will from the lightning cauldron was too strong. It was dozens of times stronger than the Thunder will in the Dao enlightenment Palace. It was also clearer and easier to comprehend.</p><p>It was as if there was an unparalleled existence teaching Lu Ming the concept of Thunder at all times.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was bathing in the ocean of the Thunder concept. The power of the Thunder was advancing by leaps and bounds.</p><p>“Cool, this is too cool!”</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. He was fascinated by the carefreeness of the rapid improvement. He was even more focused on comprehending it.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s Lightning Force was increasing at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Early, middle, and late stages of mastery of Lightning Force.</p><p>In just five days, Lu Ming’s Lightning Force had reached the perfect stage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. The Thunder mentality around him was too advanced. It was definitely not a level-one Thunder mentality. It was many times more advanced than the level-one Thunder mentality that a martial King had comprehended.</p><p>Comprehending in such an environment, for someone who was still in the form of an aura, the speed of improvement was terrifying.</p><p>It was like a person making money. When you had no capital, it was difficult to even earn tens of thousands of Yuan.</p><p>But when you have millions or tens of millions, is it difficult to earn tens of thousands? It was not difficult.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate, trying to break through the concept.</p><p>After completing the Thunder mentality, the speed of improvement started to slow down. However, it was only compared to before. Compared to others, it was still many times faster.</p><p>this feels great! I wonder what kind of expert the owner of this lightning cauldron is. It’s said that even a Martial Emperor will die Here. Could he be an existence beyond the Martial Emperor realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>Surpass a Martial Emperor? Lu Ming simply did not dare to imagine.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, a Martial Emperor was the strongest expert. They ruled over a region, their might shook the world, and no one was their match.</p><p>Was there really an existence beyond the Martial Emperor realm in the world? Lu Ming found it hard to imagine.</p><p>no wonder, it’s said that someone once obtained an inheritance at the hundred deities slope and later became an expert that dominated the divine wilderness continent. It’s really possible!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and continued to comprehend.</p><p>Half a month, just half a month later, the lightning Force had undergone a qualitative change.</p><p>It broke the shackles in one fell swoop and transformed from momentum to intent.</p><p>The Thunder mentality. Lu Ming had comprehended the Thunder mentality in one go.</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t expect to comprehend the Thunder mentality so quickly. Now, I’ve comprehended the Thunder mentality of wind, fire, and Thunder. What I need to do now is to merge the Thunder mentality with the Wind and Fire mentality. Once the three mentalities are completely merged, the three absolutes of Dragon God will immediately transform into a heaven grade upper level martial technique. Then, my combat power will reach a terrifying level!</p><p>“At that time, how many battles will I be able to fight? nine?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright.</p><p>Legend had it that nine was the limit.</p><p>No matter how peerless the divine wilderness continent’s geniuses were, they could at most reach the ninth battle. It was impossible to break through. It was like a rule.</p><p>He was a genius who had fought nine battles, and according to the legends, he had the potential to become a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was really looking forward to it.</p><p>For the time being, Lu Ming put aside the comprehension of the Thunder concept and began to focus on fusing the three concepts.</p><p>Unfortunately, the fusion of three intents was too difficult.</p><p>The difficulty of the fusion of intents would increase greatly with each additional intent.</p><p>It was even more difficult for him to merge the three intents now than it was for him to merge the Wind and Fire intents.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming already had experience in the fusion of intents. He could avoid many detours, but he could still fuse them in a short time.</p><p>As Lu Ming was trying his best to merge the three concepts, a terrifying bolt of lightning suddenly burst out in a courtyard in the Thunder Palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Lightning shot into the sky, and dark clouds instantly covered the sky.</p><p>This time, countless people were alarmed.</p><p>“Heavenly Tribulation, that’s Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>someone’s going through the heavenly Tribulation and is about to break through to the martial King realm. Who is it? ”</p><p>it should be Xue Chao. I heard that he went into closed-door cultivation in order to break through to the martial King realm!</p><p>amazing! I wonder if he can succeed!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>After that, lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled. Heavenly Fire descended, and the punishment descended.</p><p>Half an hour later, the dark clouds dispersed, and a long howl shook the heavens and earth. Then, a purple figure shot into the sky from the Thunder Palace. He stood in the air, lightning flashing around him, and he was full of a disdainful aura.</p><p>it’s really Xue Chao! He has broken through to the martial King realm! There’s another martial King under the Thunder Palace Master!</p><p>I’m so envious. After becoming a martial King, you’ll be able to transcend the mortal world and have a lifespan of a thousand years. I’ll have to work hard!</p><p>A series of discussions broke out in the surroundings. Most of them were filled with envy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu changkong’s figure appeared beside the young man in purple. He had a flattering smile on his face. congratulations, senior brother! Congratulations, you’ve entered the king’s Tier! From now on, you’ll have a thousand years of lifespan and enjoy the glory of life!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
