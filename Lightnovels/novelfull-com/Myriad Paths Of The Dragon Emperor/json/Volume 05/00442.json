It was not easy to cultivate one type of Shi to perfection, let alone two. Moreover, he had successfully fused them.</p><p>...</p><p>The difficulty of this wasn’t just two times that of comprehending a type of Shi, but rather an exponential increase.</p><p>“No wonder Lu Ming’s combat strength is so terrifying!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Hmph! It’s hard to achieve great things by doing two things at the same time!”</p><p>Hmph! Sheng Wushuang snorted coldly and said in disdain.</p><p>“Brother Sheng is right!” Zhong Hao said with a smile.</p><p>“Owwuuu!”</p><p>At this moment, a Wolf-like howl was heard in the fighting ring.</p><p>The aura on Cai Gou’s body grew stronger. A Black Dog with two heads appeared above his head.</p><p>The double-headed demonic dog was an extremely powerful demonic beast. Six silver chakras were wrapped around the double-headed demonic dog.</p><p>“It’s indeed a dog. Did I say anything wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He was a little surprised. He did not expect that Cai Gou’s bloodline was really that of a dog.</p><p>“Little bastard, what are you talking about? I’m a two-headed Hellhound, go to hell!”</p><p>Cai Gou bellowed as he activated his Blood Meridian. At the same time, his longsword trembled and the tip of the sword sliced through the air. Instantly, wind blades were formed and they were sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>There were at least a few dozen wind blades that were extremely sharp, even sharper than the blade ray.</p><p>Only those who had comprehended a trace of wind concept would be able to execute it, and even a force at the perfection stage wouldn’t be able to do so.</p><p>This could be considered to be the preliminary control of the wind.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the end of the spear and shook it. Dozens of spear flowers appeared in the sky.</p><p>Each of these spear flowers contained the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After dozens of explosions, the wind blades and the spear flowers were destroyed.</p><p>“Heavenly dog sun eating sword!”</p><p>Suddenly, Cai Gou let out a long howl and thrust his long sword out. A strange phenomenon appeared in the sky.</p><p>A sun appeared, followed by a huge Yellow Dog. It opened its mouth and swallowed the sun. With the sun in its mouth, it pounced at Lu Ming, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>“WOWO, the dog is biting!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the sky and shouted, almost causing Cai Gou’s mouth to twist in anger.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took two consecutive steps.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven trampling steps, two steps in a row.</p><p>&Nbsp; heaven and earth rumbled as a terrifying power exploded like a flood.</p><p>The Yellow Dog’s body trembled violently, and with a final wail, it exploded.</p><p>Cai Gou’s figure could not help but fly backward.</p><p>“Heavens, what did I just see? Lu Ming actually managed to defeat Cai Gou. How is that possible?”</p><p>it’s indeed unbelievable. Lu Ming’s combat strength is terrifyingly strong. However, Cai Gou has yet to unleash his strongest combat strength. It’s hard to predict the outcome!</p><p>look, Cai Gou is about to go all out!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the aura on Cai Gou’s body had actually risen by another level. Rays of red light wrapped around his body.</p><p>This secret technique was Cai Gou’s strongest state, and his combat power surpassed that of the top four.</p><p>“WOWO, the Yellow Dog has transformed!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The crowd was speechless. Cai Gou was so angry that his chest swelled.</p><p>“Die! Heavenly dog devours the sky!”</p><p>Cai Gou let out a long howl and a terrifying sword gleam burst forth, condensing into a heavenly Hound that pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This heavenly Hound was formed from sword Qi and could destroy everything.</p><p>“I’m too lazy to play with you. Let’s end this, true dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength and thrust his spear.</p><p>Groan!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard as a two-colored true dragon flew out, exuding an aura that looked down on the world.</p><p>The two-colored true dragon and the heavenly Hound collided.</p><p>At this moment, the entire fighting ring shook violently, and the terrifying energy swept in all directions.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Many people who were close to him retreated frantically.</p><p>Anyone under the half-step King realm had to retreat ten miles. Only the half-step Kings didn’t.</p><p>“Nest, isn’t this too strong? is this the battle-power of someone below the king tier? A normal martial artist of the same level would be smashed into pieces in one move!”</p><p>he’s too strong! He’s the strongest genius of the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region!</p><p>“Who will win?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were burning as they stared at the fighting ring.</p><p>Roar! The two-colored true dragon suddenly let out a loud roar.</p><p>The heavenly Hound let out a wail and collapsed.</p><p>With a scream, Cai Gou’s body was sent flying like a cannonball, sliding several miles on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged towards Cai Gou. His long spear was like a cold bolt of lightning, piercing towards Cai Gou.</p><p>Cai Gou was shocked. He rolled on the ground more than ten times and dodged Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Yellow Dog rolling around. Not bad. Let’s see how many moves you can Dodge!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and violent energy blasted forward.</p><p>Cai Gou let out a blood-curdling screech as he was sent flying like a little chick, blood spurting from his mouth.</p><p>“I surrender, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Cai Gou was afraid as he howled in shock.</p><p>“Admit defeat? I don’t accept this!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His gaze was extremely cold. The Spear’s gleam was as cold as ice. It pierced through the void and stabbed at Cai Gou.</p><p>This time, Cai Gou could no longer avoid it.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Cai Gou’s chest, lifting him up into the air.</p><p>“I admit defeat. I beg you, let me go. Let me go!”</p><p>Cai Gou let out a shrill cry of pain.</p><p>He felt that death was so close to him. As long as Lu Ming’s essential Qi exploded, he would be dead for sure.</p><p>He was afraid. He was afraid to death. As long as he thought of the great future leaving him, he would be so afraid that his whole body would tremble.</p><p>let you go? did you ever think about letting me go when you tried to take my eastern sky divine guards away? ”</p><p>“If I’m not strong enough and lose to you, will you ever let me go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was extremely cold as he asked two questions in a row.</p><p>I was wrong. I failed to recognize Mt. Tai. I failed to see. You are the true God’s favored son. I am dog shit. Yes, I am dog shit. I beg you, please let me live!</p><p>Cai Gou begged pitifully. In order to live, he could not care about anything else.</p><p>it’s too late to talk about this now. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved and said coldly.</p><p>This time, he would not let Cai Gou off. He wanted to intimidate the others with his thunderous timing and tell them that he, Lu Ming, was not a pushover. On the contrary, he was a murderous soldier, a murderous soldier.</p><p>“I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid!”</p><p>Cai Gou screamed madly and struggled madly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his long spear and his essential Qi exploded. Cai Gou’s heart exploded in an instant.</p><p>Cai Gou howled and stopped breathing.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming had won. Half step King Cai Gou had been killed.</p><p>Before this, no one would have thought of such an ending.</p><p>Almost everyone thought that Cai Gou would definitely be able to crush Lu Ming and seize the throne of the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>He had never expected that the result would be the complete opposite.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming overpowered Cai Gou and killed him.</p><p>Some of the people who were certain that Lu Ming would be defeated felt their faces burning.</p><p>This was especially so for Zhong Hao. He had even said that even he would have to put in a lot of effort to defeat Cai Gou and that Lu Ming was definitely not Cai Gou’s match. He had a very proud look on his face.</p><p>However, the reality was that Lu Ming had crushed Cai Gou.</p><p>This was equivalent to saying that Lu Ming was stronger than him.</p><p>He felt that he had been slapped by Lu Ming and his face was burning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
