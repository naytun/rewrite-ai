What are your plans next?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic.</p><p>“I think we should leave this place immediately and report the situation to the higher-ups, so that they can send more powerful experts.”</p><p>Xu Zhong’s expression was somewhat grave as he spoke.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was high, he was still a half-step King. If the other party sent out a second level martial King, they would all be in danger.</p><p>The gap between each level of the martial King realm was huge.</p><p>A Lv 2 martial King realm expert could easily kill a Lv 1 martial King realm expert.</p><p>“I also think we should leave this place.”</p><p>Huang Jing said.</p><p>“I don’t think so,”</p><p>The bald man looked at the deep pit and said while licking his lips.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Zhong and the rest looked at the bald man in surprise.</p><p>everyone, the powerhouses of the sky cloud sect, illusionary sword sect, and black Lion Hall who were martial grandmasters and above have all disappeared. They must have been killed by the sky corpse sect and brought their corpses here. They must be using the corpses to cultivate some kind of technique or to refine some kind of powerful refined corpse.</p><p>and now, we’ve killed all four corpse guards. The other party definitely heard the commotion but still hasn’t appeared. I speculate that the other party is definitely at a critical moment in cultivation. If we enter now, we might be able to kill the other party in one fell swoop, which would be a great contribution.</p><p>The bald man’s eyes were bright and full of fire.</p><p>The Empyrean divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect were mortal enemies. Now, the heavenly corpse sect had already infiltrated into the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. If they could kill some corpse guards with high cultivation bases, the Empyrean divine Palace would definitely reward them handsomely.</p><p>Instantly, Xu Zhong and the others were tempted.</p><p>“But I still think it’s too risky.”</p><p>Xu Zhong frowned and muttered.</p><p>“Brother Lu, what do you think?”</p><p>The bald burly man’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>Immediately after, Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the rest also looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ming’s combat strength was the strongest here. Imperceptibly, his weight in everyone’s hearts had also increased greatly.</p><p>“I’m fine with anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He was indeed fine with it. He had cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. If he really encountered an invincible expert, he was confident that he could still escape.</p><p>Seeing this, the bald man’s eyes lit up and he said, ” how about this? let’s go to the deep pit first and explore it. If there’s no danger, we’ll decide what to do next. What do you think? ”</p><p>“This way, it’s feasible!”</p><p>Said Xu Zhong after pondering for a moment.</p><p>Huang Jing and the white-haired old man also nodded.</p><p>This was the safest way.</p><p>Since they had already made a decision, everyone immediately restrained their auras and headed towards the deep pit.</p><p>He was slowly approaching the deep pit.</p><p>The pit was huge and circular, with a diameter of more than a thousand meters. It was pitch black below, and there was a strong corpse Qi spreading out. It was impossible to see what was down there.</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>The first to speak was Huang Jing.</p><p>“I think it’s better to withdraw first!”</p><p>Xu Zhong spoke.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of iron chains clanking came from the deep pit.</p><p>“Not good, the other party seems to be able to make a move.”</p><p>Xu Zhong’s expression changed.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of the chains colliding in the deep pit became even more intense.</p><p>It was as if there were countless iron chains flying up crazily.</p><p>“Retreat, we’ll retreat first!”</p><p>Xu Zhong cried out in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he planned to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt a cold killing intent coming from his left. At the same time, an extremely sharp sword light was stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was so fast that it was like a spark, instantly approaching Lu Ming.</p><p>This did not come from the deep pit, but from his side. It was one of his own.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly as if he had eyes. He swept the demon subduing spear in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword Qi collapsed and a figure screamed in pain. He was hit by Lu Ming’s spear radiance and flew far away, sliding on the ground for more than a thousand meters.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming turned his head, his eyes cold and emotionless.</p><p>It was the skinny man in his fifties, song ke.</p><p>The one who sneaked an attack on Lu Ming was actually song ke.</p><p>At this moment, song ke’s body was almost blown apart by Lu Ming’s spear. It was in tatters and he was severely injured.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>Only now did Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the others react and cry out in alarm.</p><p>They were all dumbfounded. They did not understand why song ke would suddenly attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why would you be on guard against me?”</p><p>Song ke shouted unwillingly as he coughed up blood.</p><p>“It’s very simple. From the moment you saw me, you were too calm. The others looked down on me, but you were too calm, as if you already knew who I was. Also, halfway through, you looked at me once or twice with killing intent. I’m just pretending not to know.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked at song ke coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>A trace of fear flashed through song ke’s eyes.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would be so meticulous at such a young age.</p><p>Lu Ming had noticed that tiny flaw.</p><p>“Speak, who sent you to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his cold killing intent enveloping song ke.</p><p>“Haha, don’t even think about it. Even if you kill me, I won’t tell you.”</p><p>Song ke laughed.</p><p>“Damn it, song ke, you’re so despicable. Let me kill you.”</p><p>The bald man was furious. He took a step forward and was about to hit song ke with his palm.</p><p>However, the moment the bald man’s palm blasted out, his body suddenly twisted and his figure turned half a circle. The surging palm force blasted wildly towards Lu Ming’s chest.</p><p>This was too sudden. Even Lu Ming did not have time to react.</p><p>Subconsciously, the bloodline of the nine Dragons burst out, forming a powerful devouring power that enveloped him.</p><p>The next moment, the bald burly man’s terrifying palm force blasted toward Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The devouring power of the nine Dragon bloodline burst forth and devoured nearly five layers of the bald man’s palm force. However, the remaining five layers still slammed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had been hit by an archaic divine mountain. His body was directly sent flying backward, and behind him was the deep pit.</p><p>“You … What are you guys doing?”</p><p>Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the white-haired elder were completely stunned. They did not understand why the bald burly man had suddenly attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>The bald man laughed crazily.</p><p>At the same time, the bald man condensed his Qi and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming’s ears.”Lu Ming, who told you to offend the master of the Thunder Palace? you’re courting death. Also, Qiu changkong and Xue Chao are heading to the burning sun Empire in the cloud Emperor mountain range. Your friends and family must all die!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bald burly man’s words were like a Thunderbolt that exploded in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned red immediately.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master, Qiu changkong, Xue Chao … Damn it! Kill! Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>Clang clang clang!</p><p>At this moment, dozens of black chains flew out of the deep pit and wrapped around Lu Ming and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
