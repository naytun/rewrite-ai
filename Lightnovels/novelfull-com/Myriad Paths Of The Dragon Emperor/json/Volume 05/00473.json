Of course, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Kill me? You’re still thinking of killing me at this time? now, we should work together and think of a way to kill our way out!”</p><p>The bald man shouted.</p><p>In just an hour, the bald man’s aura had weakened a lot, and a layer of gray corpse Qi appeared on his face.</p><p>“No need. After I kill you, I will find a way to get out myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and strode toward the bald man.</p><p>Cold sweat broke out on the bald man’s face as he retreated.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>The cold voice came from all around, as if he was waiting for a good show.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve been corroded by the corpse Qi as well. I don’t believe that you can kill me. If you fight me now, you’ll only speed up the corrosion and bring about your own destruction!”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about this.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He clenched his fist and a long spear appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and the three wills burst out. The terrifying spear light was aimed at the bald man.</p><p>The bald burly man bellowed. His saber appeared and he began to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he had been corroded by the corpse Qi and was much weaker. He was no match for Lu Ming. With just a few moves, he was forced to retreat and spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“F * ck, how are you fine?”</p><p>The bald man let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>He realized that Lu Ming’s combat strength was still at his peak. He was completely fine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his long spear forward and a three-colored true dragon flew out and collided with the bald man. The bald man screamed and spat out blood. His body flew far away and fell to the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of the bald man.</p><p>“No, don’t kill me! I beg you to spare me!”</p><p>The bald burly man shouted in fear. At this time, he was already seriously injured and could not resist.</p><p>“Just now, when you attacked me, did you ever think of letting me off?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his eyes sharp like lightning.</p><p>The bald man was stunned, and his expression kept changing.</p><p>He could not wait to kill Lu Ming just now. Why would he spare Lu Ming?</p><p>“Now, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, no, don’t kill me. Don’t kill me, Lu Ming. I’ve cultivated to the martial King realm with great difficulty. I don’t want to die like this!</p><p>The bald man shouted. A martial King could live up to a thousand years, and he did not want to die like this.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was cold and he was unmoved.</p><p>also, I’m a subordinate of the Thunder Palace Master. If you kill me, the Thunder Palace Master will definitely not let you off!</p><p>Seeing that the soft approach didn’t work, the bald man decided to use the hard approach.</p><p>that old fogey, Thunder Palace Master. I will take his dog head sooner or later!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You still want to kill the lightning Palace Master? You’re delusional. I don’t mind telling you that the Thunder Palace master’s backer is the Sheng family, one of the two great families in the Tianxuan region!”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward. This step contained the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>A loud sound came from the bald man’s body. All the bones in his body were broken, and he lay on the ground like a pool of mud.</p><p>I won’t kill you. I’ll just let you slowly feel yourself turning into a refined corpse!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, you’ll die a horrible death. If I become a refined corpse, you won’t be able to escape. You won’t be able to escape either. You’ll become a refined corpse sooner or later. Hahaha.”</p><p>Seeing that there was no hope, the bald man laughed wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He raised his head and looked upwards.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His body suddenly shot up into the sky, and he stabbed his spear towards the top of his head.</p><p>A three-colored true dragon flew out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, iron chains covered the sky and the sun from all directions.</p><p>The chains lashed down on the three-colored true Dragon’s body.</p><p>There were hundreds of chains, and in just two breaths, the three-colored true dragon collapsed and turned into nothingness.</p><p>He could not rush out at all and Lu Ming landed on the ground.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s useless. Lu Ming, you’re dead too!”</p><p>The bald man laughed.</p><p>“Hehe, turn into my refined corpses!”</p><p>The cold and sinister laughter rang out again.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and sat down cross-legged to think of a solution.</p><p>“I can’t break out of this ten thousand corpse array with my current strength. What should I do? What should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anxiety.</p><p>He was not anxious because of his own comfort.</p><p>The corpse Qi in the surroundings couldn’t do anything to him. He just had to wait a few days, and the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace might come to save him.</p><p>However, he couldn’t afford to wait for these few days.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xue Chao were already on their way to the blazing sun Empire. With Xue Chao’s martial King realm strength, the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley would be no match for him. They would only be destroyed.</p><p>Calculating the time, Qiu changkong and Xue Chao should have arrived at the blazing sun Empire long ago.</p><p>He was probably mobilizing his troops to surround and kill the mystical sword sect.</p><p>There was not much time left for Lu Ming. Hence, he was anxious.</p><p>If the mystical sword sect was annihilated and something happened to his parents, he would live in regret for the rest of his life.</p><p>“How do I break through this ten thousand corpse array?”</p><p>if I can break through to the martial King realm now, I might be able to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>Martial King, martial King … It was easier said than done to break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming’s Thunder concept had progressed the fastest. However, there was still a long way to go before he could form an intent rune. It would be difficult to form an intent rune in a short time.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up, and a hint of madness flashed in them.</p><p>“Now, we can only take the risk!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming focused his mind. In the next moment, his mind appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>The madness in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified as he looked at the huge lightning cauldron in front of him.</p><p>Previously, he didn’t dare to get too close to the lightning cauldron for fear that the lightning would destroy his mind and soul.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming decided to take a risk.</p><p>He wanted to use the power of Thunder on the Thunder cauldron to speed up his comprehension of the Thunder mentality and break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>Step by step, Lu Ming walked faster and faster, quickly approaching the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Zzzzzzzz</p><p>Lightning flickered on the lightning cauldron, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind that was manifested was trembling rapidly.</p><p>However, the closer he got to the lightning cauldron, the clearer the lightning concept became. Lu Ming could feel that his comprehension of the lightning concept was accelerating.</p><p>“Not enough, it’s still not enough, it’s still far from enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was getting closer to the lightning cauldron.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming was only a few meters away from the lightning cauldron. At this point, Lu Ming’s mind trembled violently, as if it would dissipate at any moment.</p><p>“Let’s go all out. Success or failure depends on this one move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were flickering with madness and ruthlessness.</p><p>The next moment, he suddenly took a step forward and rushed forward.</p><p>Then, he thrust his palm at the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He slapped his palm on the lightning cauldron. In an instant, an unimaginably terrifying lightning concept burst forth, completely submerging Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind could not put up any resistance at all and it collapsed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
