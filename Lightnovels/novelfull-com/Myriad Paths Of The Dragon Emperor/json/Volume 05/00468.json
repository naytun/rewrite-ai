Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as the sky corpse sect’s corpse guard blocked Xu Zhong’s attack. Although it was at a disadvantage, it had indeed blocked it.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. The combat strength of the heavenly corpse sect was simply terrifying. Not only did they have several refined corpses with them, but even their own combat strength was extremely powerful. With the same number of people, ordinary Warriors were no match for the people of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had heard that the refined corpses of the heavenly corpse sect were extremely difficult to refine. Not only did they require the corpses of martial arts powerhouses, but the conditions for refining them were also extremely harsh and required all kinds of precious materials.</p><p>Furthermore, there was a limit to the number of refined corpses each person could control. It was said that this was determined by the strength of one’s mind.</p><p>If it were not for these restrictions, the heavenly corpse sect would be invincible, and no other force would be able to compete with it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The corpse guard blocked Xu Zhong’s attack, and its figure rapidly retreated as it let out a sinister laugh.</p><p>Just as Xu Zhong was about to give chase, a creaking sound came from another huge coffin. The lid of the coffin opened, and a black chain shot out like a bolt of lightning, piercing towards Xu Zhong.</p><p>The power of the aura was extremely shocking.</p><p>Xu Zhong’s expression changed, and he couldn’t be bothered to chase after that corpse guard. He turned around to block the chains.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a few consecutive booms, Xu Zhong’s body trembled slightly, and the chains flew back.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>However, in the next moment, a low roar came from the huge coffin. A figure pounced out, chains dancing around him, and he charged towards Xu Zhong.</p><p>It was another refined corpse at the peak Lv 1 martial King realm.</p><p>Xu Zhong’s expression was grave as he engaged in a great battle with the other party.</p><p>‘Keke …’</p><p>An ear-piercing and unpleasant sneer was heard. From the second coffin, a figure wrapped in a black robe walked out.</p><p>This was an old man, and with a single look, one could tell that he was very old. His face was full of wrinkles, but his face was extremely pale, just like the corpse guard from before.</p><p>It was very obvious that this was also a corpse guard.</p><p>Beside him was a refined corpse that was tall and sturdy.</p><p>Only the white-haired elder, a skinny man in his fifties, and Lu Ming were left in the arena.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and get rid of these people.”</p><p>The old corpse guard looked at the third coffin.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A sound came from the third coffin.</p><p>Then, the lid of the coffin opened, and three figures walked out.</p><p>One of them was clearly a corpse guard and looked slightly younger, around thirty years old. Beside him stood two refined corpses.</p><p>The two refined corpses exuded the aura of the late Lv 1 martial King realm.</p><p>“Hehe, we’ll each take two of their bodies. How about it?”</p><p>The corpse guard from before appeared beside the old corpse guard and said coldly.</p><p>two bodies per person, sure. However, that brat is only a half step King. I don’t want him.</p><p>The old corpse guard immediately said.</p><p>“I don’t want that kid’s body either!”</p><p>The first corpse guard shook his head and looked at the third corpse guard.</p><p>you two, don’t go too far. You’re throwing the most trashy thing to me again. This time, I don’t want this kid’s body.</p><p>The last corpse guard said in a deep voice.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. They had not even started fighting and they were already discussing how to distribute their corpses. Did they think that they were fish on the chopping board?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there were a few loud explosions.</p><p>Then, two figures flashed. Xu Zhong and the bald man retreated quickly and stood together with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Huang Jing, don’t linger in battle. Let’s gather together and charge out together. Don’t let them break us apart one by one!”</p><p>Xu Zhong said loudly.</p><p>Huang Jing gritted her teeth. Her sword light burst out and she slashed out two times in a row, forcing the two refined corpses to retreat a little. Then, she quickly retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As Huang Jing was retreating rapidly, a metal chain pierced through the void and almost pierced through her. Although she managed to avoid it, she was still swept by the force. Huang Jing gave a muffled groan and her figure retreated rapidly to the side of Lu Ming and the others. A trace of blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two refined corpses at the peak of the first level of the martial ancestor realm stood in two directions, blocking their escape.</p><p>“Kaka, do you think that you can rush out by gathering together? You’re really naive.”</p><p>The corpse guard at the front let out an ear-piercing cold laugh.</p><p>“Hmph, with our strength, even if we can’t fight them head on, you won’t be able to stop us if we want to charge out,”</p><p>Huang Jing snorted coldly. She was injured just now and was in an extremely bad mood.</p><p>With that, he cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and said, ” “Kid, no one can take care of you right now. Don’t expect us to help you. You’re on your own now.”</p><p>“When did I say I need your help?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You’re at death’s door, yet you’re still so stubborn!”</p><p>Huang Jing coldly snorted.</p><p>“Hehe, who said that there are only the few of us here?”</p><p>The old corpse guard suddenly sneered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Zhong and the others were stunned.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>All of a sudden, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. In front of them, another huge coffin flew out and flew towards them at a high speed. In an instant, it was above Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“There’s still more!”</p><p>The expressions of Xu Zhong and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“There’s a deep pit there!”</p><p>The bald man shouted.</p><p>Everyone looked forward carefully. In the mist, they saw a huge pit in front of them. The coffin had just flown out of that deep pit.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The fourth coffin opened, and three figures walked out.</p><p>It was a young man in his twenties with a pale face.</p><p>Beside him were two refined corpses.</p><p>However, the two refined corpses had extremely powerful auras. One of them had reached the peak of Lv 1 martial King realm, while the other was in the late stage.</p><p>In an instant, the faces of Huang Jing, Xu Zhong, and the others turned pale.</p><p>This time, the other party had nine refined corpses.</p><p>Among them, there were three at the peak of the LV 1 martial King realm, two at the late stage, two at the middle stage, and two at the early stage.</p><p>With the addition of four corpse guards, this force was already far above Xu Zhong and the others.</p><p>“What do we do? I can only hold back a peak Lv 1 martial King refined corpse. If there’s another Lv 1 martial King refined corpse in the late stage, I won’t be able to break out of this encirclement.”</p><p>The bald burly man said anxiously,</p><p>I’m about the same. At most, I can only withstand a peak Lv 1 martial King refined corpse and a late Lv 1 martial King refined corpse. Any more and I’ll be in danger.</p><p>Xu Zhong also said.</p><p>The hearts of Huang Jing and the others sank.</p><p>As for the remaining five refined corpses, Huang Jing could only withstand two at the early stage of the LV 1 martial King realm. The white-haired elder and the skinny man were at the middle stage of the LV 1 martial King realm and could withstand one refined corpse each.</p><p>There was only one peak Lv 1 martial King realm refined corpse left. Who could resist it?</p><p>What to do?</p><p>Moreover, this was only a resistance. It was basically impossible to break through.</p><p>Moreover, there were still four corpse guards eyeing him like tigers watching their prey.</p><p>Today, he was most likely doomed.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but think this.</p><p>“No, I’m still young. I don’t want to die.”</p><p>Huang Jing was roaring madly in her heart.</p><p>Moreover, after his death, his corpse would be refined into a refined corpse by the people of the heavenly corpse sect. This was even more difficult for her to accept.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
