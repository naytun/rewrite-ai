It was as if he was floating in the endless void.</p><p>At the same time, he felt a numbing sensation all over his body, as if there was an endless electric current flowing through his body.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to open his eyes, only to realize that it was pitch-black in front of him. He could not see anything.</p><p>However, he could feel that there was an endless intent realm rippling around him.</p><p>Thunder concept!</p><p>what a powerful Thunder mentality. I feel like I’ve already become one with it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he immediately focused on comprehending the concept of Thunder.</p><p>His comprehension of the Thunder concept had improved by leaps and bounds, and it could only be described as terrifying.</p><p>He didn’t know how much time had passed, but his comprehension of the Thunder concept was several times stronger than before.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he had reached his limit. The next step would be to condense an intent rune.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the world shook and Lu Ming felt his vision blur. The next moment, he saw that he was in mid-air and a palm had struck the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The lightning cauldron shook slightly and a powerful force gushed out. Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward.</p><p>“Ta!” …</p><p>Lu Ming retreated more than ten steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“What’s going on? Don’t tell me that everything I experienced before was just a moment?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>That was because he was the one who had slapped the lightning cauldron.</p><p>If that was the case, it was truly shocking.</p><p>“Let’s exit and take a look!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited his sea of consciousness and looked at the bald man.</p><p>The bald man was still breathing. He screamed again and again as the corpse Qi corroded him.</p><p>“It seems that not much time has passed!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>He was really afraid that too much time had passed and he would not be able to make it back to the burning sun Empire in time.</p><p>amazing. That lightning cauldron is amazing. In just a moment, my lightning intent realm has increased by several times. However, this kind of thing can only happen once. It was too dangerous just now.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had almost thought that his soul had been destroyed. Fortunately, he did not know why but he managed to survive in the end.</p><p>However, even if he could survive this time, he might not be able to do so next time.</p><p>Unless he had no other choice, Lu Ming would not use this method to comprehend the Thunder concept.</p><p>If his soul was really destroyed, that would be an injustice.</p><p>now, can I start to form the Thunder concept? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. It was the aura of the pure Thunder concept.</p><p>Of course, it only took an instant for the Thunder concept’s aura to be completely restrained.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in a low voice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Through Lu Ming’s three divine meridians, the concept of Thunder seemed to be communicating with the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>In the vast great Dao of heaven and earth, there was a great Dao of Thunder that resonated with Lu Ming. Threads of intent appeared in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and then, these intent threads actually began to gather together.</p><p>Soon, these intent threads gathered together and gradually formed a rune. It was a Thunder intent rune.</p><p>Not far away, the bald man was dumbfounded. He shouted in disbelief, ” condensing an intent rune and breaking through to the martial King realm. He’s going to break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>He could not believe what he was seeing.</p><p>Previously, although Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely powerful, it was mostly due to the fusion of three types of concepts and an extremely powerful heaven level martial arts technique.</p><p>A single concept wasn’t very strong. The strongest Thunder concept was still a long way from forming a Thunder concept rune.</p><p>However, it had only been a few minutes and Lu Ming’s Thunder concept could actually condense an intent rune. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>this, cheating, you’re cheating!</p><p>The bald burly man roared. In this situation, the bald burly man could only find the word “cheating” to describe it.</p><p>damn it, damn it, you actually broke through to the martial King realm at this time. Damn it!</p><p>The cold voice sounded again, but this time, it was filled with panic.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>A cold voice shrieked. More than a hundred chains whipped wildly at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>However, at this moment, the clouds in the sky changed. Dark clouds gathered, and lightning flashed.</p><p>An unimaginably powerful pressure spread out.</p><p>This pressure was the pressure of the heavens.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation was a necessary step for breaking through to the martial King realm and condensing intent runes.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stood up and his Thunder mentality burst out. It was extremely rich and he turned a blind eye to the hundred or so chains that were whipping at him.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The next moment, the world lit up. Dozens of lightning bolts as thick as an arm fell from the sky and struck Lu Ming.</p><p>Along the way, the iron chains were struck by the lightning and broke apart.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The cold voice screamed.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. At this moment, an inch-long rune appeared above his head, shining brightly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Dozens of Thunderbolts struck the concept rune above Lu Ming’s head one after another. The concept rune trembled continuously as if it would collapse at any moment.</p><p>But fortunately, when the lightning disappeared, the intent runes didn’t dissipate. Instead, they shone even more brightly and became much more solid.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming felt his body go numb. A portion of the power of the lightning tribulation flowed through the intent runes and circulated throughout his body, tempering his physical body and true essence.</p><p>Although the lightning tribulation was dangerous when one broke through to the martial King realm, the rewards would be great as long as one could survive it.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, the dark clouds rolled and the rumbling sounds grew louder. It seemed that it was angry that Lu Ming had survived one round.</p><p>Dark clouds rolled, lightning flashed, and Thunder rumbled. It seemed to be brewing an even stronger lightning tribulation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He moved and rushed to the side.</p><p>Around him, he could see a number of figures, most likely refined corpses.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over, and the Tribulation cloud above his head followed him. The range of the dark cloud also enveloped the refined corpses.</p><p>“Ah, kid, what are you doing? Get lost, quickly get lost!”</p><p>The cold voice screamed in panic.</p><p>“Hehe hehe, I’ll let you have a taste of the lightning tribulation!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The Tribulation transcendence was a very wondrous moment. All living beings that were enveloped by the lightning tribulation would be struck by it.</p><p>Moreover, the stronger the living being was, the stronger the power of the lightning tribulation would be. However, the lightning tribulation that was directed at the person undergoing the Tribulation was the same and would not change.</p><p>Therefore, when others were crossing the Tribulation, it was difficult for others to interfere. No matter how strong one’s cultivation was, no matter how high one’s martial arts realm was, they would not dare to help others cross the Tribulation, because that would only bring trouble to themselves.</p><p>Therefore, he could only rely on himself to pass the Tribulation.</p><p>??…</p><p>At this moment, dozens of lightning bolts struck down from the sky.</p><p>The number was double that of the last time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
