It also had a Lv 1 martial King realm old ancestor, so its situation was similar to sky cloud sect.</p><p>Everyone in the sect, martial Grandmaster and above, including the martial King realm patriarch, had disappeared. Even their bodies had not been found.</p><p>The traces left at the scene were similar to sky cloud sect’s.</p><p>Xu Zhong and the others frowned.</p><p>This situation was really strange.</p><p>there might be two or more martial Kings on the other side. We have to be careful!</p><p>Xu Zhong said in a deep voice. He then looked at the bald man and asked,”Brother Wang, have you found anything after a few days of investigation?”</p><p>of course, we have. We have already predicted their next target!</p><p>The bald man smiled proudly.</p><p>“What? This is great!”</p><p>Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>“Based on my estimation, the enemy’s next target will be the Black Lion Hall in a few days.”</p><p>the Black Lion Hall is a sect that’s about as powerful as the sky cloud sect and the illusionary sword sect. They only have one Lv 1 martial King realm expert. We just have to wait for them to make their move. Once they’ve succeeded, we’ll follow them to their lair and wipe them out!</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>“Brother Wang, that’s a good idea. Let’s do it this way. We can’t delay any further. We’ll set off immediately and set up an ambush around the Black Lion Hall, waiting for them to take the bait!”</p><p>Xu Zhong said.</p><p>The group of six headed toward the Black Lion Hall.</p><p>The Black Lion Hall was located in a huge mountain range. From afar, the mountain range looked like a ferocious Lion.</p><p>From the mountain range, the roars of Lions could be heard, shaking the surrounding area.</p><p>The six of them found a Hidden Valley in the Black Lion Mountain range to hide in and waited quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the crown of a huge tree. He hid himself with the help of the branches and leaves. At the same time, he restrained his aura, making him look like a piece of dead wood.</p><p>Lu Ming left a trace of his attention to observe his surroundings. Most of his attention was immersed in his sea of consciousness to comprehend the concept of Thunder.</p><p>He didn’t dare to get too close to the Thunder cauldron. The closer he got, the stronger the Thunder intent would be, but the more pressure he would feel. It would be very dangerous. If he didn’t handle it well, his mind and soul might be destroyed.</p><p>Just like that, a day passed without any movement.</p><p>The next day, there was no movement.</p><p>The next day, late at night.</p><p>Wuwuwu</p><p>Suddenly, gusts of cold wind blew in the world, and it was bone-chilling.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The bald man pointed at the sky and said excitedly. Of course, his voice was very low so that only the few of them could hear it.</p><p>Everyone raised their heads and looked at the sky.</p><p>In the distance, a mass of dark clouds floated over. In the dark clouds, there was a black shadow that was faintly visible.</p><p>“What is in the dark clouds? It doesn’t look like a human figure!”</p><p>Huang Jing said.</p><p>The dark cloud was extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, it was above the Black Lion mountains.</p><p>It was soundless, and if it weren’t for their high cultivation, they wouldn’t have noticed it.</p><p>When they arrived above the Black Lion Mountain range, the dark clouds finally dispersed, revealing the object inside.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Everyone’s pupils suddenly shrank. In the dark clouds, three coffins appeared. Three incomparably huge coffins, each of which was at least a hundred meters long. They were pitch black and suspended in the air, looking very horrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The three coffins hummed and rushed towards the depths of the Black Lion Mountain range.</p><p>Not long later</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A furious roar came from the Black Lion Mountain range. Then, a Black Lion as large as a mountain range appeared in the sky.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a few black chains flew out and pierced through the void, coiling around the Black Lion. A few black shadows appeared, but disappeared in the next moment.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Deep in the mountain range, a loud roar was heard. The entire mountain range was shaking as if there were peerless experts fighting.</p><p>However, not long after, the commotion disappeared. The entire mountain range was silent, and even the roars of the demonic beasts had disappeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, three huge coffins broke through the air and flew out of the black Lion Mountain range, flying towards the North.</p><p>At this time, the Black Lion Mountain range was filled with noise.</p><p>“Grandmaster, Grandmaster has disappeared!”</p><p>“Master, my master has also disappeared!”</p><p>“The ancestor had a great battle with someone and disappeared!”</p><p>…</p><p>Wails could be heard from the Black Lion Mountain range.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll follow them!”</p><p>Xu Zhong’s eyes flickered as he softly said.</p><p>Everyone nodded and rushed into the sky. They rushed into a cloud of mist and covered their bodies with it as they chased after the three coffins.</p><p>After flying north for about two hundred thousand miles, they entered a desolate mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range was boundless and had no signs of life. There weren’t even many demonic beasts.</p><p>Moreover, the further in they went, the more desolate it became. It was even deathly silent.</p><p>On the ground, some white bones were gradually exposed.</p><p>Some broken weapons and armors could even be seen.</p><p>this place should have been a battlefield hundreds or even thousands of years ago. It’s filled with Yin Qi and killing intent!</p><p>The bald man said with a frown.</p><p>A wasteland appeared in front of them. On the wasteland, a dark red mist filled the air. A strong wind blew, making it extremely horrifying.</p><p>Hu! Hu!</p><p>The three coffins flew into the wilderness and disappeared.</p><p>Everyone muttered to themselves for a moment, then immediately chased after him.</p><p>As soon as they entered, everyone shivered because the wind in the wilderness was too cold. Even with their cultivation, they could not withstand it for a while.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and focused. They flew in the wilderness without taking up any space and looked around.</p><p>“Guys, look! There are so many coffins!”</p><p>Huang Jing suddenly cried out in a low voice. Her voice was slightly trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and saw rows of coffins in the wilderness. These coffins were about the same size as normal coffins. They were dark and eerie.</p><p>At a glance, there were hundreds of them.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was grave as they continued forward.</p><p>Very quickly, they had traveled a few dozen miles.</p><p>Along the way, the crowd saw at least a few thousand coffins.</p><p>“What the hell is this place? is it a burial ground?”</p><p>Huang Jing’s face had turned slightly pale. After all, she was a woman. Although she was powerful, she was still a little afraid of these things.</p><p>“I guess it’s a force that practices evil martial arts and is entrenched here!”</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>those martial artists above the martial ancestor realm have all disappeared, Dead or Alive. It’s extremely strange. I’ve never heard of any force in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region that would need so many coffins to cultivate.</p><p>Xu Zhong said.</p><p>“Could it be?”</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired old man’s expression suddenly changed, as if he had thought of something.</p><p>“Brother Zong, what did you think of?”</p><p>Xu Zhong hurriedly asked.</p><p>“The heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>The white-haired old man pondered for a while and said in a very serious tone.</p><p>“What? The heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Xu Zhong, the bald man, Huang Jing, and the others cried out in alarm as their expressions changed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
