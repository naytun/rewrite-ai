It had nothing to do with seniority.</p><p>At that moment, Lin Xueyi and the rest looked at Lu Ming with respect and awe.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had finally given birth to another King, and one that was so young.</p><p>Their hearts were trembling with excitement.</p><p>Five days ago, Xue Chao had displayed the strength of a King tier and destroyed the mystical sword sect’s protective formation with a single move. Just how powerful was he? They were already in despair.</p><p>However, he did not expect that the moment Lu Ming appeared, the situation would be completely reversed. With Bini Tian’s spirit, he finished off his opponent.</p><p>In the crowd, Yan Quan’s mood was extremely complicated.</p><p>In his mind, all kinds of situations in the dark Moon Empire’s mo family emerged.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming was so weak that there was a huge difference between them. However, only a short while had passed and the situation had reversed. Now, Lu Ming was much stronger than him.</p><p>so this is the legendary heaven’s favorite. I didn’t expect to meet him here!</p><p>Yan Quan sighed.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Outside the mystical sword sect, there were naturally many people who had to deal with the aftermath. Lu Ming and the rest had already returned to the mountain Gate.</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I beg you. Let me go. Send me the message!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming returned to the mountain Gate, Qiu changkong started to plead hysterically.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu changkong’s cultivation had been crippled, and all the meridians in his body had been broken. He was worse than an ordinary person, and he was lying on the ground, begging for mercy.</p><p>changkong, what’s there to ask for? The Winner Takes It All. At most, I’ll just die!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was similar to Qiu changkong, but he was much more unyielding. He sat on the ground and shouted coldly.</p><p>“Shut up, old man. It’s all because of you. I, Qiu changkong, am a genius. I should have had a bright future. It’s all because of your ambition that I offended Lu Ming and ended up in this state. It’s all because of you, old man. You should die now!”</p><p>Qiu changkong glared at Qiu Wuyang and screamed madly.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang looked at Qiu changkong in shock. He couldn’t believe that Qiu changkong would speak to him in such a manner.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s all this old man’s fault. It’s all his fault. He instigated me. If you want to kill someone, kill him. I’m innocent.”</p><p>Qiu changkong shouted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Then, he flew toward a mountain behind the mystical sword sect.</p><p>There was a small mountain at the back of the mystical sword sect. There was a courtyard on the mountain, and Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were staying there.</p><p>“Brother Tian, it should be Ming ‘er. He’ll be fine, right?”</p><p>Li Ping said worriedly.</p><p>Just now, Qiu changkong and the others had shouted Lu Ming’s name and the news had spread throughout the mystical sword sect. Naturally, they had heard it as well.</p><p>“Ming ‘er is a genius. He should be fine. Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian consoled.</p><p>Even though he said that, his eyes were filled with worry.</p><p>The battle just now was too shocking. It shook the earth and lightning flashed like the scene of the end of the world.</p><p>This scene had already exceeded their scope of knowledge.</p><p>Therefore, they could not help but be worried that Lu Ming would encounter unimaginable enemies.</p><p>“Master, Madam!”</p><p>At this moment, a burly man ran in hurriedly.</p><p>“How is it? How’s the situation?”</p><p>Li Ping asked hurriedly.</p><p>master, Madam, it’s a great victory. Young master Lu Ming has returned and killed his opponent. Now, the ten direction sword sect is almost destroyed.</p><p>The large man said excitedly.</p><p>“Really … Really?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>In his heart, the omnipresent sword sect was simply an invincible force. It dominated the burning sun Empire and was extremely powerful. Now, it was actually almost destroyed? How was that possible?</p><p>“Could it be that Ming ‘er did it?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian thought to himself.</p><p>master, Madam, I have another piece of great news. Young master Lu Ming seems to have become a King, a high and mighty king of martial arts!</p><p>The middle-aged man said excitedly. Even his voice trembled as he said this.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were stunned.</p><p>“King? Ming ‘er has become a King tier?”</p><p>After a long while, they finally reacted. Their eyes revealed a look of disbelief, and also extreme excitement.</p><p>With their previous status, it was naturally impossible for them to come into contact with King-level powerhouses. Even Grandmaster-level powerhouses were difficult to come into contact with.</p><p>However, they had already heard of the name of a king tier countless times.</p><p>They were all legendary figures who were like Immortals with the ability to destroy the world. They lived for thousands of years and overlooked the changes in the world.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had not had a King for over a thousand years.</p><p>Now, their son had actually become such a character?</p><p>They thought they were dreaming.</p><p>“Liu Chun is … Is it true?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s voice trembled slightly.</p><p>He had been a true martial artist in the past, so he knew better what a King tier meant.</p><p>In the past, the Grandmaster realm had been Lu Yuntian’s lifelong goal. As for becoming a king, he did not even dare to think about it. Now, his son, Lu Ming, had actually reached it?</p><p>it’s true! There’s absolutely no mistake!</p><p>The middle-aged man said firmly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space trembled, and a figure appeared.</p><p>The few of them were shocked, but when they focused their eyes, they couldn’t help but be ecstatic.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, Ming’ er!”</p><p>Li Ping quickly walked to Lu Ming and sized him up carefully.</p><p>In her eyes, Lu Ming was her son regardless of whether he was a King or not.</p><p>“Father, mother, Ming ‘er has returned to see you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you … You’ve broken through to the king’s realm?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian asked. His voice was trembling as he looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>“Father, I was lucky enough to break through five days ago.”</p><p>Lu Ming scratched his head and said.</p><p>“Hahaha, he’s really broken through to the king’s Tier! Hahaha, this is great! My son is a King’s Tier, and he’s so young!”</p><p>After receiving Lu Ming’s affirmative answer, Lu Yuntian was incomparably excited. He laughed heartily. He was even happier than when he broke through to the king tier himself.</p><p>“Father, I’ve come today to ask you to understand an old matter.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“An old matter?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian was a little puzzled.</p><p>“Eh? Father, mother, come with me!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming conjured a curtain of true energy that enveloped Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. Then, he turned into a flash of lightning and disappeared in a flash. In the next moment, they appeared in front of the mystical sword sect’s main gate.</p><p>“This … So fast?”</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were extremely shocked.</p><p>The mountain was dozens of miles away from the mystical sword sect, but they arrived in an instant. In their eyes, such a method was no different from a God’s.</p><p>However, this person was their son, which made them even happier.</p><p>“Greetings, old master Lu, Madam Lu!”</p><p>When Lin Xueyi and the rest saw Lu Yuntian and Li Ping, they immediately bowed and did not dare to show any neglect.</p><p>Sect leader Lin, seniors, you are too polite, too polite.</p><p>Lu Yuntian hurriedly returned the bow.</p><p>“Qiu changkong?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yuntian’s gaze swept across the area and he saw Qiu changkong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
