These balls of mist were made up of evil Qi.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons pulled again, and an explosion burst out from the Black Dragon’s body, causing a large amount of fog to explode.</p><p>The ball of mist exploded, and a milky-white gas was revealed from the Black Dragon’s body.</p><p>The milky-white gas was about a meter long and took the shape of a Dragon. At this moment, it was trembling in fear.</p><p>“Is this Gu dragon essence?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded at first, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>The Dragon essence was the essence of a true dragon. It was like the genuine Qi of a warrior, but it was many times more powerful than that.</p><p>The Dragon essence could absorb the evil Qi and murderous Qi in the world to form a Black Dragon. It definitely contained the essence of a real Dragon.</p><p>This was a Supreme treasure to a martial artist.</p><p>When a martial artist refined dragon essence, it would definitely make his cultivation advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was even more precious.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique that he cultivated was Dragon-shaped vital energy. If he could refine this dragon essence, the true war Dragon technique would definitely advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>“Haha, absorb!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and burst out with a powerful devouring power.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and swallowed the one-meter-long dragon essence.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Yi Luming controlled the nine Dragon bloodlines and pounced on the other black dragons.</p><p>Although the Black Dragons were extremely powerful, they were like mice in front of a cat in the face of the nine Dragon bloodline. They were scared half to death and their strength was greatly reduced. In a few moments, one of them was caught by the nine Dragon bloodline and the evil Qi outside was broken open, revealing the Dragon essence inside.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and sucked, devouring another dragon essence.</p><p>Then, he continued to the next one.</p><p>The Black Dragons roared in fear and turned to run.</p><p>“My dragon essence, don’t even think about running away!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase.</p><p>Just like that, a series of roars rang out in this underground abyss.</p><p>After half a day, everything calmed down.</p><p>eighteen dragon essences, a total of eighteen!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining. He sat cross-legged on a stone wall, his face shining with excitement.</p><p>He had killed 18 black dragons and captured 18 wisps of dragon essence.</p><p>Then, he turned around again to make sure that there were no more black dragons before he stopped.</p><p>“Now, I’ll begin cultivating the true war Dragon technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright. He released a wisp of dragon essence from his Nine Dragons bloodline and began to circulate the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>When the Dragon essence surged into his meridians, the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body seemed to be excited all of a sudden. It wrapped around the Dragon essence and refined it into essential Qi.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming’s essential Qi became even more lifelike, as if there were small true dragons, vivid and lifelike.</p><p>His true Qi had become more condensed.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique was quickly upgraded.</p><p>After refining one, he followed up with the second, the third …</p><p>…</p><p>After Lu Ming refined five wisps of dragon essence, the essential Qi in his body roared.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique had broken through from the fifth stage to the sixth stage. His true Qi was condensed and thick, seven times that of an ordinary person.</p><p>This wasn’t enough. He continued to refine the Dragon essence.</p><p>Two days later, the remaining dragon essence had been refined. The true war Dragon technique had broken through another level, reaching the seventh level. The density of the true Qi was eight times that of ordinary people.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation had also increased by a notch, reaching the peak of the eighth level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>He was only a step away from the 9th martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his body was filled with infinite power and his essential Qi was extremely condensed. With a wave of his hand, his essential Qi condensed into a Spear’s gleam and shot into the ground, creating a huge, bottomless hole.</p><p>The long spear that Lu Ming condensed with essential Qi was comparable to an ordinary fourth-level spiritual weapon.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s essential Qi was too condensed. The weapons that he condensed were extremely strong.</p><p>This greatly increased Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>the true war Dragon technique has been upgraded by two levels. My current combat strength is definitely at the level of a battle prodigy!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The two levels of the true war Dragon technique had allowed Lu Ming’s combat strength to cross a limit and reach the level of a level 5 fighter.</p><p>A talent of five battles, if it was spread out, it would scare people to death.</p><p>now, I will fight with Huang chixuan. I can kill him in three moves!</p><p>Lu Ming was measuring his combat strength.</p><p>His cultivation was the same as Huang chixuan’s, reaching the peak of the eighth level of martial ancestor realm. His combat strength was also at the level of a five battle genius, while Huang chixuan was only at the level of a four battle genius.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was a whole level higher than that of Yan chixuan. It was not difficult to kill him in three moves.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and stood up.</p><p>let’s see what else is in this abyss!</p><p>Lu Ming started to walk around.</p><p>The abyss was very large, dozens of miles wide. Lu Ming walked around for half a day but did not find anything.</p><p>It seemed that there were only eighteen of those black dragons and they were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>He didn’t find any other living beings or spiritual herbs.</p><p>There was nothing else but bones.</p><p>After an hour!</p><p>“Eh? There’s a stone inscription there!”</p><p>In the depths of the abyss, Lu Ming saw a stone carving on a wall.</p><p>The stone carving was ten meters long and five meters wide. A true dragon was carved on it.</p><p>The true Dragon’s scales were actually of three different colors.</p><p>“What a real stone inscription!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the stone inscription and sighed.</p><p>This true dragon seemed to be real. It was like a real Dragon embedded in the stone wall, and it gave off a majestic aura that could swallow the world.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As Lu Ming looked at it, there was a sudden explosion in his mind. Then, he realized that the surrounding environment had changed.</p><p>He found that he was in the middle of a cloud, which was actually formed by flames. Lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled in the cloud, and the wind whistled.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar reverberated through the world.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s shock, he saw a true dragon with three-colored scales, rolling and dancing in the clouds. It was more than ten thousand meters long and had five dragon claws. It was extremely terrifying as it stepped on the air.</p><p>A true dragon. Lu Ming had actually seen a true dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The three-colored true dragon let out a long roar. In an instant, the heavens and earth split apart, and a long crack appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his brain rumbling. There seemed to be a piece of information flying into his mind.</p><p>In the next moment, the world changed and the true dragon disappeared. Lu Ming realized that he was still in the abyss, looking up at the stone carvings on the stone wall.</p><p>“What’s going on? Was it just an illusion? No, there’s a new piece of information in my mind. It’s real!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, he began to organize the information in his mind.</p><p>The three absolutes of the Dragon God!</p><p>The message in his mind was a martial technique called the Dragon God’s three absolutes. It was a spear technique.</p><p>“Spear technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Now, his strongest attacks were the nine Dragons heaven stomping step and the heavenly path palm. His spear technique was the weakest.</p><p>He had always wanted to find a spear technique to cultivate, but spear techniques were much less desirable than sword techniques, saber techniques, fist techniques, and palm techniques. He had not been able to find a suitable one.</p><p>Now, how was the spear art he had obtained from the true dragon Stone inscription?</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to read it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
