He was going all out.</p><p>...</p><p>And with so many people watching, he didn’t believe that the Thunder Palace Master would dare to do anything to him.</p><p>“Audacious! Impudent!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master shouted angrily, and his aura became even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist the aura of the Thunder Palace Master and shouted, ” “Old fellow, do you think that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is yours? There are rules set by Martial Emperor Di Yi in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and I have not broken any rules. You are abusing your power for personal gain and bullying the weak. Do you not respect Martial Emperor Di Yi?”</p><p>“Also, in the future, if anyone offends your disciples, or if you don’t like the look of someone, you can bully and punish them at will!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, directly putting two big hats on the head of the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the nearly 2000 people present looked at Thunder Palace Master with strange eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was not wrong. He did not break any rules. It was his own business to cultivate a few concepts.</p><p>Even the Thunder Palace Master did not have the authority to chase Lu Ming away, because it was the right of every Ditian Divine Guard to attend classes in the nine halls. This was a rule set by Di Yi and Martial Emperor, and even the nine Palace Masters could not violate it.</p><p>“Little bastard!”</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s eyes turned gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming was not an ordinary Ditian Divine Guard. He was the eastern sky Divine Guard, and he had long attracted the attention of the other Hall Masters and even the palace Masters. In front of so many people, he really did not dare to do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not be able to explain himself.</p><p>Hmph, stubborn and arrogant. If you don’t repent, half step King realm will be your limit. Now, get out of the Thunder Palace!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master retracted his aura and berated.</p><p>Lu Ming straightened his body and wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. He had been injured just now.</p><p>“I will remember today’s humiliation. One day, I will take it back ten times!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed as he shouted. He then turned around and strode away.</p><p>The others were shocked. Lu Ming was too bold. He actually dared to speak to the master of the Thunder Palace in such a manner.</p><p>The master of thunder temple’s eyes flashed with killing intent. In the end, he did not make a move and watched Lu Ming leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming has only achieved a little bit of success and he’s blinded by it. He’s overestimating himself. A person like him will never achieve anything great in his life. You must not learn from him!”</p><p>After Lu Ming left, the Thunder Palace Master said to the others.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>A few scattered sounds were heard.</p><p>This made Thunder Palace Master very dissatisfied. He snorted coldly and began his lecture.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the lightning Palace and clenched his fists tightly as he turned to look at the lightning Palace.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master, right now, you are stronger than me. I will bear with it. But sooner or later, I will make you kneel in front of me and kowtow to admit your mistakes!</p><p>moreover, I believe that this day will not be too far away.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with killing intent. Then, he strode away.</p><p>Now, he had to quickly cultivate his Fire Force to the fire concept. Then, he would focus on cultivating his Thunder Force.</p><p>He had to break through to the martial King realm as soon as possible.</p><p>Only after reaching the martial King realm would one have a certain right to speak. Those below the martial King realm were all ants.</p><p>Without strength, one could only be bullied by others. Only when one’s own strength was strong could one control one’s own fate.</p><p>Lu Ming had long understood this principle and had been trying to put it into practice.</p><p>Back at the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>since I can’t attend the lecture, I’ll forcefully use the intent crystal to comprehend Lightning Force first.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with madness.</p><p>He then took out a lightning intent crystal and squeezed it.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The lightning intent crystal exploded, releasing wisps of intent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had not even comprehended the lightning Force yet. The number of intent tendrils that he could absorb was very little. It could be said that an entire esoteric crystal was a pure waste.</p><p>However, the ultimacy crystal was no small matter. It was a treasure that even kings coveted. Even if he only absorbed a trace of it, it would be of great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes tightly and devoted himself to his comprehension.</p><p>the power of lightning is extremely terrifying. It represents extreme speed and destructive power. It even represents the might of the heavens. Under the might of the heavens, all living things will be dormant!</p><p>All sorts of thoughts flashed past Lu Ming’s mind as he continued to comprehend.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two hours had passed. Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“Just a little bit more!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took out the second thunder-type esoteric crystal and crushed it without any hesitation.</p><p>This time, he absorbed more intent threads than last time.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and two bolts of lightning shot out. At the same time, a force erupted from his body.</p><p>Force of lightning, elementary level of force of lightning.</p><p>haha, I’ve finally learned the basics of Lightning Force. Then I’ll use the last piece of lightning intent crystal in one go!</p><p>Following that, the third Thunder-type intent crystal was used by Lu Ming.</p><p>So far, Lu Ming had used up all twenty-nine pieces of intent crystals he had obtained from the ancient battlefield of the netherworld.</p><p>This time, he absorbed even more intent tendrils. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the lightning Force was greatly accelerated. After two hours, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>His Lightning Force had directly reached the small success stage.</p><p>He had used three pieces of Thunder-attribute profound meaning crystals. The total value was definitely more than three billion lower spiritual crystals. He had used such a terrifying amount of resources to cultivate the force of Thunder to the small success stage. If others knew about this, they would be so angry that they would vomit blood and curse Lu Ming for being a wastrel.</p><p>now, I’ve already comprehended a little bit of the wind mentality. Originally, I could use the wind mentality to start refining my true Qi and slowly turn it into true essence.</p><p>however, with the amount of Zhen Qi I have, I don’t know how long it will take me to refine my Zhen Yuan with just one intent. I should wait for the fire and Thunder to completely comprehend a bit of intent, and then combine the three. Only then can I refine my Zhen Yuan faster.</p><p>furthermore, before I refine my true energy, I have to try my best to cultivate the true war Dragon technique to the highest realm of the ninth stage. Otherwise, once my true Qi turns into true energy, it will be at least a hundred times more difficult to improve the true war Dragon technique!</p><p>Lu Ming analyzed his own cultivation and the direction of his cultivation.</p><p>Once the true war Dragon technique transformed true Qi into true essence, the difficulty of raising it would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming planned to upgrade the true dragon technique to the ninth level before his essential Qi was converted into essential core. Coincidentally, he had some dragon blood flowers and a piece of Dragon Bone.</p><p>Lu Ming was a man of his word. With a wave of his hand, dragon blood flowers appeared one after another.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately picked up a dragon blood flower and swallowed it in one gulp. He began to circulate the true war Dragon technique and put all his effort into cultivating it.</p><p>One after another, the Dragon blood flowers were refined by Lu Ming. His true war Dragon technique was also improving rapidly.</p><p>Two days later, all the Dragon blood flowers had been refined by Lu Ming. He then took out the Dragon Bone.</p><p>According to speculation, it should be the Dragon fingerbone, which was obtained from the dragon’s cave. Although countless years had passed, it still contained rich essence.</p><p>With the help of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, Lu Ming began to refine the Dragon Bone with all his might.</p><p>The Dragon-shaped genuine Qi in his body became more and more condensed and powerful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
