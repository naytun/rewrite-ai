Could it be that Hall Master Feng has taken a fancy to Lu Ming and wants to take him as his disciple?”</p><p>...</p><p>it’s highly possible. Lu Ming has such cultivation and combat strength at such a young age. It’s normal for him to be favored by Palace Master Feng. I’m so envious. It would be great if I had such a master!</p><p>“Stop dreaming, let’s go!”</p><p>The surrounding people discussed in hushed voices as they speculated.</p><p>Soon, everyone had left, leaving only Lu Ming and the wind Palace Master.</p><p>Lu Ming came before Palace Master Feng and saluted him with cupped fists. He said,”I wonder why the hall Master has asked Lu Ming to stay behind?”</p><p>“Sit down first!”</p><p>Palace Master Feng smiled and raised his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sat cross-legged on a futon beside Palace Master Feng.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, are you twenty years old this year?”</p><p>Palace Master Feng asked.</p><p>“Not even 20 years old, I’m still a little short!” Lu Ming answered.</p><p>you’re not even 20 years old yet, but you already have such cultivation and combat strength. It’s really commendable. Your future is limitless!</p><p>Palace Master Feng sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed but he did not reply.</p><p>I’ve heard about your battle with Cai Gou and what Sheng Wushuang said a few days ago!</p><p>even though Sheng Wushuang’s words are too absolute, it’s not without reason. There’s a limit to one’s energy. Cultivating two wills at the same time can increase one’s combat strength in a short period of time. However, in the future, especially after reaching the martial King realm, the comprehension of the heaven and earth will be crucial. If you don’t break through your will, it’ll be difficult for you to break through your cultivation. This will greatly affect your cultivation!</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have the intention to take you as my disciple, as long as you promise to focus on cultivating the concept of wind in the future!”</p><p>Palace Master Feng said everything in one breath. He looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>To be honest, he was also very tempted to take Palace Master Feng as his master. This way, he would be able to avoid many detours in his comprehension of the creation of wind.</p><p>But to ask him to give up on cultivating the force of fire, this was something he absolutely couldn’t do.</p><p>The force of fire was the force he had comprehended the earliest. It wasn’t something he could give up on just because he said so.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming cupped his fists and said,”I, Lu Ming, thank you for your favor, hallmaster Feng. However, I have decided to cultivate both Wind and Fire. I will not give up on any of them. I’m afraid I will have to let you down, hallmaster Feng.”</p><p>By saying that, it was equivalent to rejecting Palace Master Feng.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Palace Master Feng’s expression changed. Lu Ming, I’m doing this for your own good. Please reconsider!</p><p>thank you, Palace Master Feng. I have made up my mind!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You, you’re really stubborn. Go, go quickly, or this old man will be annoyed!”</p><p>Palace Master Feng waved his hand and said. He had an expression of disappointment.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, bowed, and strode away.</p><p>sigh, I’m still too young and too confident in myself. After suffering and hitting a wall, I only know how to regret it!</p><p>Palace Master Feng sighed.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to the courtyard, he sat down with his legs crossed. The contents of Hall Master Feng’s explanation kept flashing through his mind, constantly corroborating with what he had comprehended.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the wind deepened.</p><p>However, it was unknown how far he was from being able to comprehend a trace of wind concept.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming spent another thousand top-grade spirit crystals and entered the Dao enlightenment Palace to cultivate for ten days. However, he still had not touched the threshold of the intent realm.</p><p>it seems like I can only use intent crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>In the ancient battlefield of the netherworld, Lu Ming had obtained a total of twenty-nine ultimacy crystals.</p><p>Among them, there were four pieces of wind attribute, five pieces of fire attribute, three pieces of Thunder attribute, and the rest were of other attributes, such as gold and water attributes.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself for a moment. Then, he went to the mystical treasure house and exchanged all the other attribute profound meaning crystals for wind attribute profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Of course, the exchange fee was 1000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming only had 45000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals left.</p><p>Lu Ming had a total of twenty-one pieces of wind-attribute profound meaning crystals.</p><p>As for the fire-type and Thunder-type ultimacy crystals, Lu Ming did not exchange for them as he would definitely need them later.</p><p>In the courtyard of the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and a green crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and the crystal was crushed. At once, waves of mysterious wind concept spread out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This concept of wind was actually in the shape of a thread, but it was a few hundred times thinner than a strand of hair. However, when Lu Ming comprehended it, he felt that it was many times clearer than when he was in the Dao enlightenment Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He focused all his attention on capturing the fine threads of the concept of wind that was spreading around his body and started to comprehend it.</p><p>As expected of an esoteric crystal, a treasure that even martial Kings drooled over. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of wind had greatly accelerated.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, there were wisps of the essence realm of heaven and earth that were absorbed by Lu Ming and entered his body.</p><p>Intent crystals were the physical embodiment of the intent realm of heaven and earth, and they had been formed over countless years.</p><p>Every wisp he absorbed would be able to speed up his comprehension of the concept of wind.</p><p>However, even more intent realm threads dissipated in the air. He didn’t have time to absorb them.</p><p>If this scene was seen by others, they would probably be so jealous that they would vomit blood.</p><p>A waste, this was a complete waste. A single intent crystal had caused most of the intent realm threads to dissipate. This was simply a waste of God’s gifts.</p><p>One had to know that even half-step Kings rarely used intent crystals to cultivate.</p><p>That was because it was too wasteful. One of them would cost at least 1000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Only martial Kings who used intent crystals to cultivate would not waste them. They could absorb all the intent threads.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not care so much. In his opinion, it would be a waste if he did not convert the resources into strength as soon as possible and left them there.</p><p>Only by improving his strength could he obtain more resources and treasures.</p><p>An hour later, the intent realm tendrils of an intent crystal had completely disappeared.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out another wind-type esoteric crystal and crushed it.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>Subsequently, a cracking sound would be heard in Lu Ming’s courtyard every hour.</p><p>Twelve hours later, Lu Ming had already used up twelve pieces of wind-type esoteric crystals.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes grew brighter and brighter. Circles of green energy swirled around his body. The force of the wind on Lu Ming’s body was raised to its maximum.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a Green Wind blade flew out from his fingers, cutting a stone block into two.</p><p>wind concept! I’ve finally comprehended a trace of wind concept!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of wild joy.</p><p>From force to intent, there was only a single step away, but the difference was like heaven and earth.</p><p>This was a fundamental difference, the difference between rotten wood and steel.</p><p>The fact that he had comprehended a trace of the concept meant that Lu Ming was already half a step into the realm of a King.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth grade martial ancestor realm. He could now be considered a true half-step King.</p><p>After spending twelve esoteric crystals, Lu Ming finally made a breakthrough in one go.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
