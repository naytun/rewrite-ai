Endless power and concept gushed toward the spear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At the next moment, Lu Ming and the long spear seemed to have become one. They turned into a sharp spear ray and stabbed forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space seemed to have been pierced by the spear tip as it began to fluctuate violently.</p><p>From a distance, the space looked like a wave that had been pierced by a sharp weapon. Ripples appeared on both sides, and a clear mark appeared in the middle.</p><p>This was the strongest move of the Dragon God’s three absolutes, the extreme strike.</p><p>It could only be used after one comprehended the three intents of wind, fire, and lightning and completely fused them together.</p><p>This move had the speed of the Thunder concept, the penetrating power of the wind concept, and the explosive power of the fire concept.</p><p>It was known to be indestructible, able to pierce through everything, it was the strongest offensive killer move.</p><p>This move was aimed at the last corpse guard that appeared.</p><p>This move was too fast. In an instant, it had arrived in front of that corpse guard.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>That corpse guard cried out in fear and wanted to Dodge, but it was simply too late. He could only stretch out that deathly White Claw and block in front of him.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>His steel-like claws were pierced through like tofu. Then, the spear went through the man’s forehead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, with a shake of the long spear, the force exploded and the opponent’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>A powerful corpse guard had died just like that, killed by Lu Ming with one shot.</p><p>This corpse Guard’s combat strength was definitely not weaker than a late-stage Lv 1 martial King realm. However, it was killed by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>If not for the fact that they were in the middle of a huge battle, Xu Zhong and the rest would have been stunned.</p><p>Even so, they were tongue-tied and shocked.</p><p>This was especially so for Huang Jing. She was almost scared out of her wits. At the thought of how she had ridiculed Lu Ming previously, she would be done for if Lu Ming shot her in the same manner.</p><p>As soon as the corpse guard died, the two refined corpses that were fighting Lu Ming stopped in the air like two puppets, not moving at all.</p><p>“Ah, not good, gather the refined corpses to defend!”</p><p>The remaining three corpse guards were simply scared out of their wits as they frantically shouted, desperately trying to recall their own refined corpses to defend.</p><p>“Stop them, stop these refined corpses!”</p><p>Xu Zhong roared as he used all his strength to hold the two refined corpses back.</p><p>The others were the same. They fought with all their might to hold back the refined corpses so that they couldn’t go back to defend.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The three corpse guards roared and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming cast another extreme blow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The man and spear became one, piercing through the air and stabbing towards the back of a corpse guard.</p><p>“Argh! No, help!”</p><p>The corpse guard was scared out of his wits and roared desperately. With a wave of his hand, an ancient bronze coffin actually appeared in front of him, blocking him.</p><p>However, it was still useless. Lu Ming’s spear ray pierced through the ancient bronze coffin and the other party’s heart.</p><p>The corpse guard let out an unwilling roar and then stopped breathing.</p><p>The second corpse guard, dead!</p><p>Once this corpse guard died, the three corpse guards he controlled directly stopped in the air like puppets.</p><p>Among them was a refined corpse at the peak of the LV 1 martial King realm. It had been fighting with the bald man, but now it had all stopped.</p><p>“You from the heavenly corpse sect, go to hell!”</p><p>The bald man didn’t have an opponent, so he immediately roared and charged towards the last two corpse guards.</p><p>In addition, there was also that skinny man in his fifties. He also had no opponents and also charged towards the two corpse guards.</p><p>The situation had been reversed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The demon subduing spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled slightly, as if it could not bear the burden.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming also took a few deep breaths to calm the surging essential core in his body.</p><p>it’s still a bit difficult to perform a Gokudo path attack now. It consumes a lot of genuine vitality and physical strength!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Although the extreme blow was powerful, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, he could only cast it a few times. Moreover, he could not unleash much of the power of this move.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to unleash the strongest power of this move, he would have to break through to the martial King realm and condense intent runes for all three intents.</p><p>“Also, this demon subduing spear is no longer of much use.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the demon subduing spear in his hand and thought to himself.</p><p>The explosive power of a Gokudo path attack was too great, and it was a huge burden on the spear.</p><p>“Let’s kill these two corpse guards first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred. His long spear shook and he continued to attack the two corpse guards.</p><p>The enormous spear ray pressed down, and with the cooperation of the bald man and the skinny man, in just two moves, the two corpse guards coughed out large mouthfuls of blood and were heavily injured.</p><p>“Save me, young master kui, save me!”</p><p>The two corpse guards shouted crazily and ran towards the deep pit with all their might.</p><p>there are still people over there. Kill these two as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>From the meaning of the two corpse guards, there was still someone in that deep pit, and it seemed to be even stronger.</p><p>For some unknown reason, he still hadn’t appeared, but no matter what, he had killed two corpse guards first.</p><p>“You want to leave? Die!”</p><p>The bald man roared as he charged towards the two corpse guards.</p><p>In addition to Lu Ming and The Thin Man, the two corpse guards could not resist at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear was as large as a mountain. It combined three concepts and pressed down.</p><p>The old corpse guard screamed in pain. His body made cracking sounds as he was blasted into the soil by Lu Ming.</p><p>Blood flowed out of his mouth, and he was already exhaling more than he was inhaling.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>On the other side, the bald brawny man slashed out with his saber, splitting that corpse guard in half.</p><p>At this point, the four corpse guards had all been killed.</p><p>Once the four corpse guards died, those refined corpses all stood there like wood.</p><p>ahaha, the heavenly corpse sect’s disciple is finally dead!</p><p>The bald man laughed.</p><p>Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the rest also heaved a long sigh of relief, as if they had been relieved of a heavy burden.</p><p>Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the white-haired elder walked towards Lu Ming. However, the expressions on their faces were extremely complicated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I really failed to recognize you previously. I’m so ashamed!”</p><p>Xu Zhong cupped his fists at Lu Ming, his face filled with shame.</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>Huang Jing bit her lips tightly. Her face was red from embarrassment. She looked at Lu Ming and wanted to say something but stopped herself. She wanted to apologize to Lu Ming. However, at the thought of her previous attitude, she could not bring herself to do so.</p><p>She had mocked Lu Ming for being a burden to them previously. But what was the truth? It was Lu Ming who had saved them. If not for Lu Ming, they would have been in danger.</p><p>little brother Lu, you’re much more powerful than the rumors say. Please forgive me for my previous offense!</p><p>The bald man also walked over and said with a forthright smile.</p><p>Previously, he had also looked down on Lu Ming and thought that he would be a burden to them.</p><p>However, they now realized that Lu Ming’s combat strength was much stronger than what was rumored.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
