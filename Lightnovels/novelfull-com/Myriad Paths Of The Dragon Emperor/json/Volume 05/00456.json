The price was a terrifying 100000 spiritual crystals, which made many people’s souls tremble.</p><p>100,000 spiritual crystals of the highest quality. What kind of concept was that? many people would not be able to see that many spiritual crystals in their entire lives.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master stood at the side with a gloomy face. He also wanted to bid, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so.</p><p>However, he was very eager to get the sword-shaped plant. However, if Lu Ming sold it to one of the hall Masters, he would have no hope.</p><p>“Seniors!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly cupped his fists at the hall Masters in the sky and said in a clear voice, ” seniors, I will keep my word. I said that I will use this sword-shaped plant as a wager, and I will keep my word. It won’t be too late to sell it to you after I win!</p><p>“This …”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the hall Masters all shook their heads and sighed.</p><p>In the surroundings, most of the people were secretly scolding Lu Ming for being a fool. The hall Masters had offered such a high price and he actually did not want to sell it. He actually wanted to sell it after he won? Was that even possible?</p><p>“Isn’t Xue Chao’s luck too good? This Lu Ming is just a hothead and arrogant. He actually wants to win against Xue Chao. There’s no such possibility.”</p><p>Lu Ming hadn’t reached half-step King realm when he was in the Ditian Divine Guard exam. Even if he broke through to half-step King realm during this period of time, he still wouldn’t be Xue Chao’s match. The gap between half-step King realm and King realm is too big. Even the most powerful genius would find it hard to cross that gap.</p><p>that’s right. Since ancient times, there have been very few half-step King Warriors who could go against the heaven and fight against King Warriors. Those kinds of people, as long as they grow up, they will become great figures.</p><p>in the past thousand years, there has only been one person in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region who has defied the heavens and defeated a King with the cultivation base of a half-step King. That is the peerless genius from a hundred years ago.</p><p>“You mean Yan Kuang tu?”</p><p>of course, who else could it be? he is the only half-step king who could defeat a King in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region in the last thousand years. He is also the disciple of the nine suns Supreme Master. He is now one of the top experts in the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>“How can Lu Ming be compared to Yan kuangtu? the difference is too great.”</p><p>However, there was one exception, and that was the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>At this moment, he was simply smiling in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to use the sword-shaped plant as a prize. Wasn’t this clearly giving it to him for free?</p><p>Thunder Palace Master tried his best to hold it in and almost burst out laughing.</p><p>“Xue Chao, tell me, do you dare to bet? my sword-shaped plant will bet with you for 80000 top quality spiritual crystals. Do you dare? if you don’t dare, just say it. I will change to another one!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Eight … Eighty thousand?”</p><p>Xue Chao was a bit dazed and stuttered.</p><p>He did not have 80000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>He had just broken through to the martial King realm, and he had already used up all his best-grade spirit crystals to refine his vital essence.</p><p>Moreover, even if he had not used all of them, he would not have 80000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>He was very willing to bet with Lu Ming but he really could not afford to fork out this sum of spiritual crystals.</p><p>“Chao ‘er, make a bet with him. I’ll pay for the spiritual crystals.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master spoke.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a storage ring appeared in his hand and he threw it to Xue Chao.</p><p>Xue Chao was ecstatic. He took the storage ring and said,”Thank you, master.”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master nodded his head lightly, but he was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p>“This old man is so cunning!”</p><p>The Other Palace Masters cursed in their hearts.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please be my witness. If I win, I’m afraid that someone won’t admit it.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the few Hall Masters.</p><p>Everyone was speechless again. Did he really think he would win?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to worry about this. Since the few of us are here, none of you can go back on your word!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said firmly.</p><p>The other Hall Masters nodded.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to thank the hall Masters!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he looked around and his gaze landed on a young man with a sword-shaped mark between his eyebrows.</p><p>This person was the leader of the four divine guards, Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>“Sheng Wushuang, since you’re here, why don’t we have a bet?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Wushuang and said.</p><p>“You still want to bet with me? What are we betting on?”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s eyes were also fixed on the sword-shaped plant. He looked away unwillingly and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Of course it’s on who will win, me or Xue Chao. I’ll bet top quality spiritual crystals on myself. I’ll bet less on you, just 30000 top quality spiritual crystals. Do you dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Why not? I’ll bet 30000 crystals on brother Xue’s victory!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang waved his hand and a huge Jade box appeared. After opening it, Supreme-grade spirit crystals were arranged neatly inside, emitting dense heaven and earth Spirit Qi.</p><p>WOWO, this Sheng Wushuang actually has 30000 Supreme spiritual crystals. He’s really rich.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where are your top-grade spirit crystals? take them out!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang said.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Sheng Wushuang, are you afraid that I’ll go back on my word?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>How could he have 30000 Supreme spiritual crystals? There were only 10000 Supreme spiritual crystals, which he had obtained from the burly young man’s storage ring.</p><p>He didn’t have it.</p><p>He was just trying to gain something without anything.</p><p>“Hmph, I don’t think you’ll dare to renege on your debt!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang snorted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you done?”</p><p>Xue Chao said coldly.</p><p>“I’m done. You can start now.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xue Chao and smiled faintly.</p><p>This attitude made Xue Chao furious.</p><p>“Wait, I’ll make you cry!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s eyes revealed killing intent. A powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>His entire body flashed with lightning as a powerful Thunder concept exploded out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll defeat you in three moves!”</p><p>Xue Chao let out a long hiss, his imposing manner was wild.</p><p>He clenched his fist in the air, and bolts of lightning gathered in his hand, forming a sword of lightning.</p><p>“Thunder slash!”</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Xue Chao took a step forward and his lightning sword slashed down at Lu Ming. The might of a martial King was exuded in full force.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and kicked forward.</p><p>A terrifying power spread out.</p><p>The two forces collided and Lu Ming’s body was sent flying backward.</p><p>But Xue Chao didn’t move at all.</p><p>he’s defeated. Lu Ming is going to be defeated. The difference is too great.</p><p>that’s right. Xue Chao should not have used his real power, but Lu Ming was completely outmatched and was sent flying with one move.</p><p>you’re so arrogant with this little combat power. I’m really speechless.</p><p>A wave of discussion immediately broke out in the surroundings.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Xue Chao roared, his eyes incomparably cold.</p><p>He pounced on Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He took a step forward and his figure soared into the sky.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>This time, he took two steps.</p><p>The space shook violently. The two terrifying forces overlapped, becoming several times stronger as they surged towards Xue Chao.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful force spread in all directions, and lightning flashed. Lu Ming and Xue Chao were both sent flying backward.</p><p>They were evenly matched!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
