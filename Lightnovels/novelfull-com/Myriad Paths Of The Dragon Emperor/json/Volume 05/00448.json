It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“What the hell is he doing now?”</p><p>“He’s probably cultivating some kind of secret technique!”</p><p>Hmph, on the path of martial arts, the intent realm of heaven and earth is more important the further you go. He only knows how to cultivate some unorthodox secret techniques. His combat power has indeed increased, but what’s the use of that? ”</p><p>that’s right. He’s already on the wrong path. Ignore him. Let’s go! the old man said.</p><p>After a round of discussion, these people were too lazy to pay attention to him and returned to their respective courtyards.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached a critical moment.</p><p>The true Qi in his body had been condensed to the extreme. It was completely made up of true dragons, and each true dragon swam in his meridians.</p><p>Then, another Dragon’s Roar came from the cyclone in his dantian.</p><p>At this moment, the Qi cyclone in his dantian had undergone a fundamental change. Originally, the Qi cyclone was made up of pure true Qi, but now it had become two true dragons.</p><p>The two true dragons continued to circle around each other.</p><p>On the side, small true dragons kept flying in and out.</p><p>“I’ve broken through to the ninth stage of the true war Dragon technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and burning.</p><p>After ten days of cultivation, he had refined the Dragon blood flower and the Dragon Bone. He had broken through two levels of the true war Dragon technique, from the seventh to the ninth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had increased sharply again.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a true dragon flew out from his dantian and charged straight into his sea of consciousness.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a rumbling explosion in his sea of consciousness. A message inexplicably appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>True war Dragon technique Foundation establishment chapter, major completion!</p><p>This was the sentence that suddenly appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“What do you mean? Great completion of the foundation establishment chapter? Could it be that the true war Dragon technique is divided into many chapters, and I’m only cultivating the Foundation Stage?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a daze. His mind was filled with questions.</p><p>maybe, it’s very possible. After all, the true war Dragon technique was brought out by the nine suns Supreme from the nine Dragons ruins. Maybe he only brought a part of it out and didn’t bring the whole thing!</p><p>if that’s the case, then there are other chapters of the true war Dragon technique. If a single Foundation chapter can cultivate ten times the amount of true Qi, then how terrifying are the other chapters? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts. Towards the end, his heart was already burning with passion and he was full of expectations.</p><p>it seems that I must go to the nine Dragon ruins if I have the chance in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming decided in his heart.</p><p>It could be said that his current achievements were inseparable from his relationship with Jiulong.</p><p>The first bloodline was awakened by a drop of blood essence from the nine Dragons.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique and the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps he cultivated were both brought out from the nine Dragon ruins by the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>Lu Ming had to go to the nine Dragon ruins.</p><p>“Now that the true war Dragon technique has been fully cultivated, it’s time to go to the hundred deities slope to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming left the eastern sky courtyard and went to the square where he had first entered.</p><p>He took out the Ditian Divine Guard’s token and channeled essential Qi into it. Runes immediately appeared and a small vortex suddenly appeared in the air. Lu Ming did not hesitate and stepped into it.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he was already in the myriad Star City, in front of the huge Pavilion of the Emperor sky divine Palace.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he flew to the West.</p><p>The hundred deities slope was more than three hundred thousand miles to the West of the myriad Star City. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, it would only take him a few hours to travel three hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Two hours later, an area shrouded in gray fog appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Looking from a distance, this area seemed to be endless and vast.</p><p>The hundred deities slope was extremely strange. It was said that tens of thousands of years ago, the hundred deities slope wasn’t called the hundred deities slope but had another name.</p><p>One day, a crack suddenly appeared in the sky, and more than a hundred corpses fell from it.</p><p>There were corpses of all races. Some were human-shaped, and some were from other races.</p><p>Some of them were not big, while some were as big as mountains.</p><p>According to the records, some people had seen the corpses of divine beasts like true dragons and phoenixes fall.</p><p>Each and every one of the corpses had a monstrous aura, and were all existences beyond imagination.</p><p>That was why people called him the hundred gods.</p><p>After those corpses fell to the ground, the entire hundred deities slope changed. The entire area was filled with killing intent and baleful Qi. No one could enter this area.</p><p>No matter how strong an expert was, once they entered that area, their bodies would be torn apart by the powerful killing intent and their divine soul would be destroyed.</p><p>It was only after 10000 years had passed that there were some changes. Some people discovered that those below the martial King realm could enter.</p><p>However, those above the rank of martial King were still unable to enter.</p><p>Those above the rank of martial King would die an unnatural death.</p><p>In the past, there had even been a Supreme existence at the martial Royal realm who had barged in, but had not come out yet.</p><p>As for those below the rank of martial King, they would be fine and would even be able to obtain unparalleled opportunities.</p><p>Inside, not only would it be very helpful for the comprehension of the essence realm of heaven and earth, but one could also obtain some Supreme treasures.</p><p>There were even people who obtained the inheritance of an unparalleled existence inside, and from there, they soared to the sky and became the peak experts of the continent.</p><p>There was a period of time when the hundred deities slope became the focal point of all the major factions in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>However, as time passed, more and more people entered. Most of the treasures and inheritances inside had already been plundered clean. This was why the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was able to occupy it later on.</p><p>Otherwise, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace alone might not be able to take over such an important place.</p><p>Even now, the hundred deities slope was still one of the most important sacred grounds in the Tianxuan region’s Eastern Palace. The number of people who could enter was extremely small, and not many people could enter every year.</p><p>Lu Ming slowly approached the hundred deities slope.</p><p>“Who is it? This place is the forbidden ground of my empyrean heaven divine Palace. Anyone who trespasses will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>A loud shout rang out, and an aura shot up into the sky like smoke. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>A tall middle-aged man suddenly appeared not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>King tier, this was definitely a King tier, and he was extremely powerful.</p><p>The hundred deities slope was the sacred ground of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. It was normal for there to be powerful existences guarding it.</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that there was more than one expert around the hundred deities slope. There were probably many experts.</p><p>“Senior, I’m the new eastern sky Divine Guard of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. This is my Divine Guard token!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, took out the divine Guard token, and handed it to the middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man took it and looked at it. His expression softened and he revealed a faint smile.”You are indeed the eastern sky Divine Guard. You have one chance to enter the hundred deities slope. Go on in, but you can only stay in there for three months at most. After three months, you must come out, or you will be in danger!”</p><p>He then returned the divine Guard token to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you, senior. I’ll definitely come out in three months!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the token and in a flash, he flew forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
