No wonder the Emperor heaven divine Palace was one of the strongest powers in the Eastern Region of the mysterious sky region. If it was in the blazing sun Empire or even the cloud Emperor mountain range, it would be almost impossible to buy a half-step King realm beast core.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the demonic core and left the mystical Treasure Hall, satisfied.</p><p>Back at the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and waved his hand. One hundred demonic cores floated in the air.</p><p>“Begin, devour!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged, and it roared into the sky. It opened its mouth and inhaled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, five monster cores were swallowed by the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic pill was swallowed by the bloodline of the nine Dragons and exploded, turning into rolling energy that was constantly being refined.</p><p>After his nine Dragon bloodline reached the fifth level of the king tier, the power of devouring and refining had increased by many times. The speed of refining was terrifying.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The energy, impurities, and harmful substances in the demonic core were constantly being refined. The remaining pure energy essence was constantly surging into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique at full force and began to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Originally, he had already reached the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm. Now, he was trying to break through to the ninth level.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The demonic pill of a half-step demonic King contained extremely dense energy. The bottleneck of the 9th martial ancestor realm started to loosen.</p><p>“Not enough, give me five more!”</p><p>The nine-Dragon bloodline opened its mouth and swallowed another five demon cores.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Pang Bo’s energy rushed into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he broke through the bottleneck of the ninth grade martial ancestor realm.</p><p>He had reached the 9th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>continue! Let’s rush to the peak of the ninth level of martial ancestor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning as he continued to devour the demonic cores of the semi-demonic Kings.</p><p>After reaching the 9th level of the martial ancestor realm, the demonic pill of a half-step demonic King would slow down his cultivation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had bought a hundred demonic cores, which was enough to support him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level kept increasing.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had refined all 100 demonic cores. His cultivation had also successfully advanced to the peak of the ninth level martial ancestor realm.</p><p>At this point, no matter how hard Lu Ming tried, it would be difficult for him to make any progress.</p><p>Further down was the comprehension of force. By controlling force to comprehend intent, one only needed to comprehend a trace of the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>He could use the intent realm of heaven and earth to refine his true Qi and slowly transform it into a higher level of energy, true origin!</p><p>This process was extremely difficult. When most of the genuine Qi in his body had been converted into genuine vitality, he still needed to comprehend a complete realm of heaven and earth and form a rune of realm in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>After that, they still had to go through the trial of the lightning tribulation before they could become a King.</p><p>A King was like a blade, a heavenly chasm. Wanting to cross it was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>Countless geniuses were often stuck at the half-step King level.</p><p>Many of them had even formed intent runes at the last step, but they died tragically under the lightning tribulation.</p><p>There were too many such examples.</p><p>However, once he broke through to the martial King realm, he would achieve a substantial leap. Not only would his combat strength be greatly enhanced, but his lifespan would also be extended to 1000 years.</p><p>A King had a thousand years of life and could look down on the changes of the world. They could see the rise and fall of generations of talents.</p><p>Grandmasters, on the other hand, could only live for 200 years at most, not much longer than ordinary people.</p><p>A King, in a sense, had already broken away from the category of mortals.</p><p>It was simply too difficult to break through to the king tier.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire, for example, had not had a King for over a thousand years.</p><p>Some mid-tier empires might have Kings, but they were all low-tier Kings. It might take hundreds or thousands of years for one to appear. Two kings would be considered good.</p><p>Only high-tier empires had more Kings.</p><p>Many geniuses claimed to have the potential to become martial Kings when they were young, but most of them were exaggerated. It was only a possibility, and most of them would not be able to break through to the king’s realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s next step was to master the two types of forces to perfection.</p><p>After force reached perfection, one could go one step further and comprehend intent.</p><p>“Dao enlightenment Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Then, he got up and left the courtyard, heading towards the Dao enlightenment Palace.</p><p>The Dao enlightenment Palace could help people comprehend Shi, so he naturally had to make use of it.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the Dao enlightenment Palace.</p><p>In front of the Dao enlightenment Palace, there were seven white-haired old men sitting cross-legged. Each of them looked like an ordinary old man. They didn’t give off any aura and looked like seven ordinary old men.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not dare to underestimate him. Those who could guard the Dao enlightenment Palace were definitely martial King realm experts. They might look ordinary now, but once they exploded, it would definitely be earth-shattering.</p><p>“Senior, I want to enter the Dao Comprehension Palace to cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>“Sure, 100 top-grade spiritual crystals a day. How many days do you want to go in?” he asked.</p><p>An old man with a face full of wrinkles said.</p><p>“I want a month!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, he took out 3000 Supreme spiritual crystals and handed them to the old man.</p><p>The old man took it and nodded. yes. One month! he said.</p><p>Then, a beam of light entered the door of the Dao enlightenment Palace. The door rippled with light and a light screen appeared. On the light screen, a Whirlpool appeared.</p><p>the door is open. Go in. Remember, one month later, the Dao enlightenment Palace will send you out on time!</p><p>The old man reminded.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and strode forward. He stepped into the vortex and the world spun. In the next moment, Lu Ming found himself standing in a piece of chaos.</p><p>Yes, the surroundings seemed to be in chaos. There was no up or down. It was all hazy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a deafening explosion was heard. Lu Ming then saw a light spot shining in the chaos in the distance before it exploded.</p><p>Hualala! Chaos was surging. Endless intent realms and laws of heaven and earth were entangled, forming a complete world.</p><p>This was a scene that could only be seen when the heavens and earth were created.</p><p>the essence realm of heaven and earth. What a powerful essence realm of heaven and earth. So many essence realms of heaven and earth!</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his surroundings were filled with various concepts of heaven and earth.</p><p>All of a sudden, two kinds of intent domains of heaven and earth became especially clear and filled the world.</p><p>It was the intent of Wind and Fire.</p><p>They were also the two types of forces that Lu Ming had comprehended.</p><p>“Could it be that different forces or intents will appear here according to the different forces or intents that each person has comprehended? Martial Emperor Di Yi is indeed hard to predict.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he thought solemnly.</p><p>“I don’t care about that. I’ll comprehend it first!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat down cross-legged, allowing himself to enter an ethereal state. He extended his thoughts and felt the Wind and Fire between heaven and earth.</p><p>The Wind and Fire concepts were too profound. Lu Ming had only used the Wind and Fire concepts to comprehend force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
