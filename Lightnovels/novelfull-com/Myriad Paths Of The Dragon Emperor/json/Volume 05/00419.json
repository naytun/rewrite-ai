Only by climbing it could one become a preparatory Emperor sky Divine Guard.</p><p>After climbing the thousand-step Jade staircase, there was another test. Only by passing the next test could one become a true Emperor sky Divine Guard.</p><p>There was no one around. Lu Ming speculated that they should be in the inscription array.</p><p>The thousand-step Jade staircase in front of him was most likely condensed by an inscription formation.</p><p>“Let’s see what’s so special about this thousand-step Jade staircase.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped on it, a huge force between heaven and earth pressed down on him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he offset this force.</p><p>this power not only affects the physical body, but also the genuine Qi in the body. Even the mind is under pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart moved and he was secretly amazed.</p><p>However, although this force was strong, it was like a Buddha’s face in the spring breeze to Lu Ming. He did not feel much.</p><p>“Ta!” …</p><p>Lu Ming walked up step by step. His body was straight and he was as unmoving as a mountain.</p><p>Very quickly, he had stepped over a hundred Jade steps.</p><p>He discovered that the higher he went, the greater the pressure he felt.</p><p>However, such pressure was nothing to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked faster and faster. One by one, he stepped on the Jade stairs.</p><p>In just a few minutes, Lu Ming had reached the thousand-step Jade staircase.</p><p>Above the thousand-step Jade staircase was a platform. In front of the platform was a stone door. The stone door was open and there was a flash of light. The scene behind the stone door could not be seen clearly.</p><p>Behind this stone door was the second round of assessment. After passing this round of assessment, one would be able to become a true Ditian Divine Guard.</p><p>On the left side of the platform, there was a vortex, which was the teleportation gate.</p><p>If one felt that they were not strong enough and could not pass the second round, they could leave this vortex and naturally be transported to the corresponding location.</p><p>If one wanted to try, it was also possible. It was said that there wouldn’t be any real danger. If there was really a crisis, the formation would teleport the person away to the area where the Emperor sky divine guards were prepared. That person would be considered to have failed the trial.</p><p>……</p><p>At this time, there was a huge circular building in the ten thousand stars city. It covered an area of thousands of acres and could accommodate millions of people at the same time.</p><p>This building was like a Colosseum (football field), but it was divided into four areas by two intersecting light screens.</p><p>It was like a piece of cake that had been cut into four fan-shaped areas. They were the North, South, East, and West areas. The four areas did not see each other, and their vision was blocked by the light screen.</p><p>The Eastern Region was divided into five levels according to their distribution.</p><p>At the center of the fan shape was the first level, and there was a fighting ring.</p><p>The outer ring of the battle stage was the second level. There was a stone tablet with the words ‘Ditian Divine Guard’ written on it.</p><p>On the third level, there was also a stone tablet with the words ‘reserve empyrean heaven Divine Guard’ written on it.</p><p>Further out, the fourth level was not written at all.</p><p>Further out were rows of seats. This area was the largest, just like the outermost ring of a cake.</p><p>Now, all the seats were full.</p><p>It was densely packed with people. No one knew how many people there were.</p><p>Among these seats, there was a rather special seat. This seat was occupied by the leading elders of each region.</p><p>Lu Xiu, the leading elder of the cloud Emperor mountain range, was sitting inside.</p><p>Beside him were Zhao sui, the leader of the thousand River region, and han Xun, the leader of the nether demon Palace.</p><p>Their eyes were fixed on the empty area of the few levels below.</p><p>Those few levels of regions were engraved with profound inscription formations that led to the ancient battlefield of the netherworld.</p><p>As long as someone climbed the thousand-step Jade stairs and chose to walk into that vortex, they would be teleported to the ‘reserve Empyrean Heavenly Divine Guard’ area.</p><p>As for those who chose to continue the challenge but failed, they would also be teleported to the Emperor sky Divine Guard reserve area, which meant that they could only become one reserve Emperor sky Divine Guard.</p><p>By the same logic, as long as one became an Empyrean sky Divine Guard, they would be teleported to the ‘Empyrean sky Divine Guard’ area.</p><p>As for those who had not even become the Emperor sky divine guards, all those who had failed would be sent to the open space on the fourth level.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Xiu, you don’t have to stare at me so intently. It’s useless even if your eyes explode. I reckon that everyone in the cloud Emperor mountain range has died. Let alone becoming an Emperor sky Divine Guard or a reserve Emperor sky Divine Guard, I’m afraid that there won’t even be many who can come out alive.”</p><p>Zhao sui, the elder leading the team of the thousand River region, suddenly said coldly.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s face darkened and he said, Zhao sui, she hasn’t come out yet. No one knows what the result will be. Aren’t you afraid of hurting your tongue by saying this now? ”</p><p>“Tongue? Haha, what a joke. I’m sure of that. Those useless people in the cloud Emperor mountain range will definitely die unless they find a place to hide.”</p><p>Zhao sui said with a cold smile.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Lu Xiu’s expression was unsightly.</p><p>“Zhao sui, you’re speaking too early. Every year, there are geniuses from small regions who join the Ditian divine guards,”</p><p>On the side, the elders from the other smaller districts spoke up for Lu Xiu.</p><p>hehe, a bunch of trash that only knows how to console themselves. I feel that brother Zhao is right. Trash from a small region should be better off dead. To think that they want to compete with us from a large region for the position of the Emperor sky Divine Guard. They really don’t know their own limits.</p><p>A faint voice was heard. It was han Xun, the elder leading the team of the dark Demon Palace.</p><p>His words were full of contempt, which made the leading elders of several small areas on the side look extremely ugly.</p><p>“Haha, you’re right, Brother Han. Lu Xiu, if you want to watch, then continue. I’m afraid the more you watch, the more despair you’ll feel.”</p><p>Zhao sui revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>“Someone’s coming out!”</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>In the open space of the fourth level, people kept appearing.</p><p>The people who had appeared all had looks of disappointment and unwillingness on their faces.</p><p>Those who appeared in this area had failed and were completely eliminated.</p><p>The elders ‘faces didn’t change much. In every region, a large number of people would be eliminated. This wasn’t surprising.</p><p>What they were paying attention to was how many people would appear in the reserve Empyrean Heavenly Divine Guard area and the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Guard area.</p><p>After a short while, there was finally some movement in the area where the Emperor sky divine guards were in reserve. A figure appeared in a flash.</p><p>“Haha, he’s a genius from my region. I knew that this brat would be able to become a reserve empyrean heaven Divine Guard.”</p><p>An elder leader of a small district laughed excitedly.</p><p>Following that, more and more people were teleported out of the area where the Ditian divine guards were being prepared.</p><p>“Jiang hongwen, Shangguan Yunyan!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Xiu’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He saw Jiang hongwen and Shangguan Yunyan in the area where the Emperor heaven divine guards were preparing to be stationed.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s face was filled with joy.</p><p>Jiang hongwen and Shangguan Yunyan were ranked third and fourth respectively on the cloud Emperor ranking list. It was within his expectations that they could become reserve empyrean heaven divine guards. However, there were always accidents. He was really afraid that, as Zhao sui had said, all the geniuses of the cloud Emperor mountain range had fallen in the ancient battlefield of the netherworld.</p><p>When he saw the two of them, he was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>haha, Zhao sui, it seems that not a single Ditian Divine Guard has appeared in your thousand River region.</p><p>Lu Xiu felt much more at ease now that two of them were on the way to becoming Emperor sky divine guards. He looked at Zhao sui and mocked him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
