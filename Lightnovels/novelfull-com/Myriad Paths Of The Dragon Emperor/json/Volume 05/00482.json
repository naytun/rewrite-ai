Lu Ming would have rushed back at all costs, and the master of the Thunder Palace had already set up experts here, waiting for Lu Ming to take the bait and kill him in one fell swoop.</p><p>The purpose of the consecutive traps was to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>After the one-eyed man’s group of five heard this, they sneered a few times and didn’t say anything, which could be considered as tacit agreement.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, let’s see how arrogant you can be now. Today is the day you die!”</p><p>Qiu changkong finally stopped running when he saw the one-eyed man and the other four. He became braver and laughed out loud as he looked at Lu Ming with contempt.</p><p>kill him! Kill him! No, don’t kill him yet! Cripple him! I want to kill his family and friends one by one in front of him! I want him to see his family die miserably in front of him! I want him to regret it! I want him to die in regret!</p><p>Xue Chao shouted crazily.</p><p>He had been abused by Lu Ming time and time again. His hatred for Lu Ming had seeped deep into his bones.</p><p>“If you two little dogs don’t run now, you won’t have the chance later.”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Qiu changkong and Xue Chao.</p><p>The two of them couldn’t help but feel a chill in their hearts, but when they thought about the one-eyed man and the others, their courage was boosted.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming had broken through to the martial King realm?</p><p>He had only just broken through to the martial King realm. The gap between each level of the martial King realm was extremely huge. No matter how monstrous Lu Ming was, it was impossible for him to cross two levels in the martial King realm and fight the one-eyed man.</p><p>Moreover, there were four other experts assisting him. Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>“Lu Ming, cut the crap. Die!”</p><p>The one-eyed man’s body gave off a shocking aura.</p><p>big brother, he’s just a young fellow who has just broken through to the martial King realm. Why do you need to do anything to him? I’d like to see what this eastern sky Divine Guard is capable of.</p><p>Another burly man walked out. He held a long spear in his hand, revealing his sharp edge.</p><p>that’s good. Fifth brother, you go first. Let’s see what this eastern sky Divine Guard is capable of. Some people are very strong in the martial ancestor realm, but after breaking through to the martial King realm, they become ordinary. Therefore, the combat power of a martial ancestor doesn’t mean that after breaking through to the martial King realm, their combat power will remain so strong.</p><p>The one-eyed man said.</p><p>‘No matter how talented Lu Ming is, he can still fight above his level. That Great Han Dynasty’s early stage of the second tier martial King realm cultivation base should have no worries in protecting himself,’ the one-eyed man thought to himself.</p><p>“Haha, good!”</p><p>The burly man strode towards Lu Ming, the aura on his body extremely violent. He shouted coldly,”Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The burly man thrust the long spear in his hand. An extremely sharp spear pierced through the void and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll send you on your way first,”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and a three-colored true dragon pounced forward, roaring furiously.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The tip of the man’s spear was crushed by the three-colored dragon’s claw, but it didn’t stop and continued to pounce on the man.</p><p>“Fifth brother, be careful!”</p><p>The one-eyed man roared.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The three-colored true dragon crashed into the burly man’s body. The burly man screamed as his body was sent flying like a broken sack. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>One move and he was heavily injured.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A Lightning Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. With a wave of his hand, the lightning Spear turned into a bolt of lightning and stabbed at the burly man.</p><p>It was too fast for the other party to Dodge.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The lightning Spear pierced through the opponent’s chest, blasting a huge hole.</p><p>“Ah, big brother, avenge me!”</p><p>The burly man didn’t die for a while. He let out a shrill scream and then died.</p><p>“Fifth brother!”</p><p>“Fifth brother!”</p><p>……</p><p>The remaining four burly men all let out shrill roars.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the rest of the mystical sword sect members were dumbfounded.</p><p>Although the martial King realm was beyond their knowledge, they could still tell from their auras that the five men were extremely powerful. Each of them was several times stronger than Xue Chao.</p><p>However, such a powerful expert, an existence that they looked up to, was killed by Lu Ming in two moves. Lu Ming’s combat strength had simply exceeded their imagination.</p><p>“My God, it’s only been a short while and Lu Ming has already grown to such a level. As expected, the blazing sun Empire is too small. It’s like a quagmire, while Lu Ming is a true dragon. Only when a true dragon is free from the quagmire can it soar to the nine Heavens and display its true glory.”</p><p>The old ancestor of the ghost moon saber sect, Shangguan Ming, muttered to himself.</p><p>On the other hand, Qiu changkong and Xue Chao were the complete opposite. Their faces were pale and bloodless.</p><p>Xue Chao, in particular, was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>If Lu Ming had wanted to kill him just now, he would have been dead.</p><p>He shivered at the thought of this.</p><p>“How could this be? How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so strong? Why? How did he cultivate? God, why are you so unfair? Why can’t I be the one who’s so strong?”</p><p>Qiu changkong glared at Lu Ming with extreme jealousy, roaring in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill my fifth brother! You deserve to die! Kill! Let’s attack together and tear Lu Ming into a thousand pieces! Don’t let a single one of his family off!”</p><p>The one-eyed man roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The eyes of the other burly men were red and they emitted a sharp killing intent. A long spear appeared in each of their hands.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The four burly men joined forces and launched an earth-shattering attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. With a wave of his hand, endless power of thunder and lightning gathered between heaven and earth and condensed into a long spear. This long spear of thunder and lightning exuded a terrifying Thunder concept. Lightning flickered as if it was the might of heaven.</p><p>The experts from the mystical sword sect, the sun Legion, and the ten direction sword sect, such as Qiu Wuyang, widened their eyes and stared at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Under this pressure, it was as if they were facing the might of the heavens. Their entire bodies trembled and they almost knelt down.</p><p>“Is this Lu Ming’s ability?”</p><p>Their hearts trembled as they thought.</p><p>“The initial success of the first level Thunder mentality? impossible! Didn’t you just break through to the martial King realm? How is that possible?”</p><p>The one-eyed man let out a terrified roar.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on them. He shouted and thrust his long spear forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Four spearlights instantly pierced through the void and stabbed toward the four burly men.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four loud bangs, the attacks of the four burly men were destroyed at the same time, but the lightning Spear did not stop and continued to pierce through them.</p><p>Then, there were three shrill screams.</p><p>Except for the one-eyed man, the other three men followed the footsteps of the previous man. Their chests were pierced by the lightning Spear, and their hearts were completely burned by the power of lightning.</p><p>“2nd brother, 3rd brother, 4th brother!”</p><p>Although the one-eyed man managed to escape, he still coughed up blood and roared.</p><p>big brother, run! This guy is a monster. You’re not his match!</p><p>A burly man roared and then died.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>The one-eyed man let out a long roar, his killing intent soaring to the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
