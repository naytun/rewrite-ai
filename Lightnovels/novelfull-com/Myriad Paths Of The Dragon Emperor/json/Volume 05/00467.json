Like the Emperor heaven divine Palace, it was one of the most powerful factions in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Furthermore, the heavenly corpse sect and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were mortal enemies. They fought endlessly and would fight to the death whenever they met.</p><p>The most terrifying thing was that the heavenly corpse sect had suddenly risen in the past 300 years. They were expanding at a terrifying speed, continuously encroaching on the original territory of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace had fought against it for hundreds of years, but not only did they not destroy it, but the heavenly corpse sect’s power had also become stronger and stronger.</p><p>At this point, although the heavenly corpse sect was still weaker than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they were not far behind.</p><p>However, wasn’t the heavenly corpse sect always fighting against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in some large regions in the depths of the eastern barren territory? When did it appear in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region?</p><p>The Tianxuan region was located in the extreme East of the divine wilderness continent. To put it bluntly, it was on the border, but the heavenly corpse sect had actually infiltrated this place?</p><p>“Could buchen be from the heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Huang Jing’s voice trembled a little. Her face was pale.</p><p>“Hehehe, your guess is correct. We are the people of the heavenly corpse sect, and we are the corpse guards of the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Suddenly, a few cold and ear-piercing laughter rang out. The sound was extremely unpleasant, like two pieces of metal rubbing against each other.</p><p>Hu! Whoosh!</p><p>Three huge coffins, each a hundred meters long, flew through the air.</p><p>In an instant, the three coffins stopped in three different directions, surrounding everyone in a triangular formation.</p><p>“They’re actually really from the heavenly corpse sect, and they’re corpse guards!”</p><p>The faces of Xu Zhong and the others were extremely grave.</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect’s corpse guards and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace’s empyrean heaven divine guards had the same meaning. They were the elites of their respective forces.</p><p>I understand now. So, you captured those powerhouses who were above the martial ancestor realm to refine them into refined corpses!</p><p>Xu Zhong said.</p><p>“Hehe, nonsense, those guys” corpses are of course used to refine into refined corpses!”</p><p>A cold laugh came from a coffin in the East.</p><p>CAW CAW, the use of a martial arts Grandmaster’s corpse is limited after all. Now that I’ve sent a few martial King realm corpses, I can refine a few more powerful refined corpses!</p><p>A voice came from the coffin in the West.</p><p>“You’ve already discovered us?”</p><p>Xu Zhong said.</p><p>“Kaka, nonsense! Ditian divine guards, you’ve been investigating us. Do you think we don’t know? The reason we went to the Black Lion Mountain range was to lure you here. Hehe, obediently accept your death!”</p><p>A cold sound came from the coffin on the east side. At the same time, the lid of the coffin opened with a click. Seven or eight black shadows flew out from it. They were black chains.</p><p>bastards of the heavenly corpse sect, this is the Tianxuan region, the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Since you’ve come here, you can all stay here!</p><p>The bald man roared and pounced toward the coffin in the East.</p><p>A dazzling saber radiance that was a thousand meters long slashed out. It was as if it could split the entire heaven and earth.</p><p>But-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black chains seemed to have a mind of their own as they pierced through the air. The eight chains intertwined together and attacked the blade energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent vibration, the saber ray was destroyed by the iron chain, but the iron chain also flew back.</p><p>“You have some skill. Good, good. The stronger you are, the better. The stronger you are, the stronger the refined corpse will be!”</p><p>A cold and sinister laugh came from the coffin.</p><p>Then, the coffin made a cracking sound and the lid was completely opened.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A burly figure flew out from inside.</p><p>This figure was more than two meters tall. Its face was pale and bloodless, but there was a hint of black iron in the paleness.</p><p>His eyes widened in anger, but there was no emotion in them.</p><p>There were black chains wrapped around its body.</p><p>“This is a refined corpse, not the original person!”</p><p>Xu Zhong said in a deep voice.</p><p>hehe, I didn’t expect that a country bumpkin from a remote place like the eastern part of the Tianxuan region would have some knowledge!</p><p>The ear-piercing sound continued to ring out from the coffin. Then, a black shadow emerged.</p><p>This black figure looked very thin. His body was wrapped in a black robe, revealing a pale face.</p><p>His face was as pale as a corpse, but his eyes were cold. This meant that he was alive.</p><p>It was said that the heavenly corpse sect’s Warriors mainly controlled corpses.</p><p>Each of them would refine at least one refined corpse, or even more refined corpses, and bring them with them.</p><p>The stronger the refined corpse was, the stronger they were.</p><p>“Hehe, die, kill!”</p><p>The sky corpse sect’s corpse guard shouted with a murderous aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The refined corpse waved its arms, and the eight chains danced wildly toward the bald man.</p><p>“Don’t think I’m afraid of you!”</p><p>The bald man roared and charged at the refined corpse.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Instantly, the two of them began to fight.</p><p>The refined corpse was extremely powerful. Its strength was equivalent to that of a peak Lv 1 martial King realm martial artist, and it was evenly matched with the bald man.</p><p>“Hehe, do you think that’s all I have? come out!”</p><p>The corpse guard suddenly shouted in a low voice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, two tall figures flew out of the huge coffin.</p><p>Just like the previous one, it was also wrapped in black chains. Its face was pale, and within the paleness, there was a layer of black iron.</p><p>Refined corpses. These two were also refined corpses.</p><p>Moreover, their bodies exuded a strong corpse Qi. Their aura was so strong that they had all reached the early stage of Lv 1 martial King realm.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>A mere corpse guard of the heavenly corpse sect could actually control three refined corpses of the martial King realm. His strength was too terrifying.</p><p>As soon as the two refined corpses appeared, they pounced on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I’ll kill them!”</p><p>Huang Jing coldly shouted. Her body moved and pounced towards the two refined corpses.</p><p>The aura of the middle Lv 1 martial King realm erupted from his body.</p><p>Moreover, Huang Jing was not an ordinary Ditian Divine Guard. She was the same as Lu Ming, a genius who had passed the previous selection. Her combat strength was a level higher than ordinary martial Kings.</p><p>His combat strength was close to the later stage of the LV 1 martial King realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Huang Jing’s sword was like lightning. In an instant, she had struck out several hundred times.</p><p>However, when the sword light hit the refined corpses, it was as if it had hit metal. There were sounds of metal clashing and sparks flying. In the end, it only left a few shallow marks on the corpses.</p><p>“This kind of refined corpse is similar to the Golden-eyed blood corpse. They both have copper skin and iron bones, and are invulnerable!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Huang Jing continued to shout as she engaged in an intense battle with the two refined corpses.</p><p>“Kill the corpse guards first!”</p><p>Xu Zhong suddenly shouted in anger and pounced towards the corpse guard, his speed as fast as lightning.</p><p>“Kaka, you want to kill me? in your dreams! Heavenly corpse claw!”</p><p>The sky corpse sect’s corpse guard sneered and pounced towards Xu Zhong, stretching out a pair of thin claws and grabbing forward.</p><p>Immediately, corpse Qi filled the air, and the claw light slashed out like a blade.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xu Zhong roared in anger as he slashed out a sharp sword ray.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
