Moreover, his wind-Fire Force was only at the phenomenal success stage.</p><p>It was already very good that he was able to produce the sound of a Dragon’s Roar on his first attempt. It was all thanks to that stone carving.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued cultivating.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming was fully immersed in his cultivation.</p><p>There were two main types of cultivation. One was the Dragon God’s three absolutes and the other was the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>This was because these two types of inscriptions could inspire one and greatly help one’s cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, two months had passed.</p><p>There were only a few days left until the end of the Ditian Divine Guard selection.</p><p>At this moment, all the geniuses in the eastern nether ancient battlefield were gathering towards the center of the battlefield.</p><p>There, he would take part in the final assessment.</p><p>In the dragon’s cave, blood Qi was rolling like an ocean in the huge underground cave. Suddenly, the blood Qi churned and formed a blood-red giant dragon. It rushed toward a blood-robed young man and entered his body in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood-robed youth suddenly opened his eyes. Two rays of blood-red light shot through the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than a hundred black-robed men appeared in front of the blood-robed young man and shouted, ” congratulations, senior brother!</p><p>hahaha, it’s all thanks to the blood of those geniuses that I’ve achieved great success. Unfortunately, one of them jumped into the abyss, and the other one escaped. Otherwise, I could have reached a higher level. But this is enough. The eastern sky divine guards, one of the four sky divine guards, will be buried by me.</p><p>The blood-robed youth laughed.</p><p>“Senior brother is invincible!”</p><p>The black-robed man flattered.</p><p>“Haha, let’s go. Let’s head to the place of the final examination.”</p><p>The blood-robed young man smiled and led everyone out of the dragon’s cave, rushing towards the central area.</p><p>There was an extremely Hidden Valley some distance away from the dragon’s cave. This Valley was filled with Rolling thunder and lightning, and it was filled with endless power of lightning.</p><p>A young figure walked out of the valley. His body was covered in thunder and lightning, and his aura soared to the sky.</p><p>I didn’t expect to cultivate for almost three months. Lu Ming, don’t die. If you want to die, you’ll have to wait until I find out the secret of the Martial Emperor’s treasure!</p><p>A cold voice came from the person, as cold as the winter snow.</p><p>This person was Qiu changkong.</p><p>With a cold laugh, Qiu changkong turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the horizon, heading towards the central region.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was still cultivating.</p><p>In the abyss, Lu Ming stared at the stone inscription in a daze. He only came to his senses after an unknown period of time.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming said softly. The demon subduing spear suddenly appeared. The power of wind and Fire grew and he thrust the spear.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as the power of wind and Fire converged, forming a two-colored true dragon that roared wildly.</p><p>the Dragon God’s three absolutes are the limit of the first level. It’s a pity that I’ll need to perfect the power of wind and Fire to break through to the second level.</p><p>After nearly two months of cultivation, he had finally succeeded in cultivating the Dragon God’s three absolutes. Moreover, he had reached the limit of the first level.</p><p>One had to know that this was equivalent to a heaven grade lower level martial skill. To be able to successfully cultivate it in such a short period of time was already very rare.</p><p>it’s a pity that I still haven’t successfully cultivated the third step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>During this period, the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps had also improved by leaps and bounds. Lu Ming felt that he was only one step away from cultivating the third step of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>Once he cultivated the third step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, his power would increase crazily.</p><p>The power of the third step was equivalent to the sixth stage of a heaven grade low level martial technique.</p><p>it’s a pity that I don’t have much time left. The three-month period is almost up. I really want to continue cultivating here!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and looked at the Dragon-shaped stone carving with bright eyes.</p><p>“Can we dig out this stone inscription?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the stone inscription and studied it carefully. After a while, he flew up and took out a shiny big knife. He actually started to cut around the stone inscription.</p><p>He wanted to take this stone inscription away.</p><p>Zzzzzzzz</p><p>The stone walls here were extremely hard, equivalent to a fourth-level spirit weapon. Sparks flew when it cut into the stone walls, and the resistance was unbelievably strong.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and exerted all his strength to cut and dig.</p><p>After a long time, Lu Ming was sweating profusely and he was only halfway done.</p><p>“Haha, sure, let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming buried himself in his work again.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Suddenly, the stone inscription made a cracking sound and a crack appeared in the middle.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Kachaa! Kacha!</p><p>The sounds became more and more intense, and Spider-web like cracks appeared on the stone.</p><p>Bang! In the end, the entire stone inscription exploded and turned into ashes, scattering in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>This stone inscription had actually exploded on its own.</p><p>sigh, it seems like we can’t take it away. Once we excavate it, the stone inscription will self-destruct!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in pity.</p><p>In that case, he was the only one who knew the three absolutes of the Dragon God.</p><p>forget it. Without the stone inscriptions, I can still cultivate the three absolutes of the Dragon God to the highest realm. I have to set off now. Any later and it’ll be too late.</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and flew up.</p><p>However, when he was more than a thousand meters in the air, there was an invisible force that blocked Lu Ming’s flight.</p><p>Lu Ming slid to the side, stuck to the wall, and quickly climbed up.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming finally left the abyss and arrived at the huge cave.</p><p>The underground cave was quiet, without a single sound.</p><p>There were hundreds of dried corpses lying on the ground. They were all the young experts who had come in last time.</p><p>As for that piece of dragon scale, it had naturally disappeared without a trace.</p><p>I wonder if bu Feifan and the others have escaped!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and walked forward.</p><p>Suddenly, he stopped.</p><p>There were a few mummies here which attracted Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>“Bu Feifan, Sun Chu!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Through their clothes, he recognized two mummified corpses. They belonged to bu Feifan and sun Chu.</p><p>It seemed that the strongest of these two super regions did not manage to escape in the end.</p><p>However, he did not see Xuan Feng’s body.</p><p>did Xuan Feng escape? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The ancient barren city had always been mysterious. It was normal for Xuan Feng to have some powerful escape techniques.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not stop. He turned into a ray of light and rushed up the cave.</p><p>Very soon, they were out of the dragon’s cave. Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure disappeared from the place.</p><p>He was heading towards the central area with all his might.</p><p>…</p><p>In the central region of the eastern nether ancient battlefield, there were 108 sacrificial altars built on a flat piece of land.</p><p>Each altar was a hundred meters tall and was extremely majestic.</p><p>One hundred and eight altars were scattered in four regions. Each region had twenty-seven altars, and the four regions were nine hundred miles apart from each other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
