They did not believe that Lu Ming could kill a third level martial King not long after he had broken through to the martial King realm.</p><p>...</p><p>After all, a Lv 3 martial King was much stronger than a Lv 1 martial King.</p><p>The main reason they came to befriend Lu Ming was because of his potential. They valued his future and not his current combat strength.</p><p>Now, they finally understood that Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>To be able to kill you Ming in a few moves, he could be said to be the strongest person in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun.</p><p>Especially the master of great sun Prefecture, his body was trembling slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was beyond his imagination. If he wanted to kill him, he did not need one move. Half a move would be enough.</p><p>amazing, truly amazing. Heroes really come from the youth. It seems that this old man has really become old.</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire’s Grand Emperor reacted and sighed.</p><p>that’s right. The champion King is truly a rare heaven’s favorite. In the future, he’ll definitely become a famous expert on the continent and his name will shake the world!</p><p>Immediately, the dozen or so martial Kings all smiled and flattered Lu Ming.</p><p>The other people at the scene were stunned.</p><p>They found that the Kings who were usually high and mighty were now like ordinary people. They would flatter and fawn over stronger people.</p><p>everyone, some problems have been solved. Please take a seat and continue drinking!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>After cultivating in the earth cave for more than ten days, Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through to the middle of the first tier martial King realm. His combat strength had also improved. Lu Ming did not find it strange that he could use the third step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps to kill netherworld.</p><p>The banquet continued immediately.</p><p>However, everyone’s mood at this banquet was different.</p><p>The people of the burning sun Empire were naturally excited.</p><p>With an expert like Lu Ming in charge, the blazing sun Empire would definitely flourish.</p><p>As for the people from the other empires, all sorts of thoughts flashed through their minds.</p><p>The banquet went on for five hours before it was announced to be over. The crowd slowly dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping stayed in the imperial capital for two days before they returned to the Lu family.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming had a feeling and flew towards the mystical sword sect.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the mystical sword sect, the sky above the mystical sword sect was filled with blood.</p><p>It was the blood cocoon formed by the Golden-eyed blood corpse. It seemed like the evolution had been completed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood cocoon trembled, and the blood Qi around it was so thick that it couldn’t dissipate.</p><p>After a long while, the blood Qi gathered toward the blood cocoon and disappeared.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, the blood cocoon cracked open, and a strong figure walked out.</p><p>It had golden eyes, a blood-red mist, and its skin had turned pale gold. Its hair and fangs had disappeared, and it looked like a normal person.</p><p>A terrifying aura spread out from the Golden-eyed blood corpse’s body.</p><p>A King. This was the aura of a King.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse had successfully evolved into a true king after absorbing the blood of five to six kings and the blood of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>When the Golden-eyed blood corpse saw Lu Ming, a trace of excitement flashed across its face. It bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Golden Eye, you can speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and asked.</p><p>yes, I can naturally speak after breaking through to the king tier.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie bowed.</p><p>as expected. Legend has it that once a demonic beast reaches the demonic beast King level, it can also speak. It seems like the king level is really a huge gap.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He took out a set of clothes and threw it to the Golden-eyed blood corpse.”Put on your clothes!”</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse took the clothes and put them on.</p><p>Golden Eye, come back to the Lu family with me. You’ll be responsible for the safety of my parents in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood zombie bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed that the Golden-eyed blood corpse had become a King.</p><p>Originally, he was worried about Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s safety, but now that the Golden-eyed blood corpse had broken through to the king tier, he was much more at ease with it protecting Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>In a flash, they headed for the Lu family.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to the Lu family.</p><p>When Lu Yuntian found out that the Golden-eyed blood corpse had evolved into a King, he was first shocked, then pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>After seven days, the scars on Lu Yuntian’s face had completely disappeared. Not a single scar was left behind. He had regained his usual handsomeness and looked 60 – 70% similar to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, Li Ping, and the rest were overjoyed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming bade farewell to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. It was time to return to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>After Li Ping’s reminder, Lu Ming rose into the air and left in an instant.</p><p>However, he didn’t go to the Emperor heaven divine Palace immediately. Instead, he came to the imperial capital of the cloud desolate Empire.</p><p>That was because there was still one thing that had not been resolved.</p><p>Although netherworld had been killed by Lu Ming in the underworld Royal Palace, there were still some other powerhouses below. If Lu Ming left, these powerhouses might harm Lu Ming’s family.</p><p>He had to get rid of this scourge first.</p><p>In the 36 countries of Emperor Yun, the person who knew the underworld Royal Mansion the best was undoubtedly the Emperor of the cloud desolate Empire.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arrival shocked the cloud wilderness Empire. Naturally, it was easy to meet the cloud wilderness Empire’s Grand Emperor.</p><p>The retired emperor of the cloud desolate Empire was called Huang Xu. When he heard that Lu Ming was going to deal with the Hades Palace, he was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>champion King, my cloud desolate Empire has been investigating the Hades Palace for close to a hundred years. Even though the Hades Palace headquarters is extremely secretive and we think that no one knows about it, in fact, I have long known about it.</p><p>in the past, I was afraid of netherworld’s strength, so I didn’t attack the underworld King’s headquarters. Now that netherworld is dead, I can get rid of this scourge, this cancer!</p><p>Said Huang Xu, overjoyed.</p><p>“Senior Huang, we don’t need too many people. Just the two of us will be enough.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll Take You There immediately!”</p><p>Said desolate.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the ruins flew out of the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital and headed north.</p><p>The northern side of the cloud Emperor mountain range was extremely desolate. There were mountains everywhere, and powerful demonic beasts roamed.</p><p>There was no empire here, and not many people survived.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ruins came to a wide Lake.</p><p>as far as I know, there’s another universe under this Lake. The headquarters of the Hades Palace is right under this Lake.</p><p>Said desolate.</p><p>“It’s indeed secretive.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the ruins rushed into the lake.</p><p>With true essence covering their bodies, the two of them silently headed to the bottom of the lake.</p><p>The lake was very deep. The deepest part was actually a thousand meters deep.</p><p>There wasn’t much mud at the bottom of the lake. Most of it was made of smooth rocks. In the middle of the rocks, there was a two-meter-wide crack. There were inscriptions in the crack that blocked the lake water, so the lake couldn’t flow in.</p><p>It was obvious that the Hades “headquarters was right below.</p><p>The two of them concealed their auras and silently passed through the inscriptions.</p><p>After seeing through the inscription, his eyes suddenly opened up.</p><p>Below them, there were actually some naturally formed underground caves that extended in all directions, extremely wide.</p><p>In front of him, he could hear faint voices.</p><p>The two of them moved forward.</p><p>In a small cave, a few assassins in black robes from the Hades Palace were talking.</p><p>Lu Ming and the ruins flashed past and the few assassins fell down silently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
