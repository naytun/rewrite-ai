Let me tell you, you’re just an ant in front of me!</p><p>Qiu changkong looked down at Lin Xueyi arrogantly.</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s expression was extremely ugly, and her figure quickly retreated. At the same time, Ling potian also followed Lin Xueyi, and the two of them retreated back to the mountain Gate.</p><p>“Activate the sect’s protective array!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As Lin Xueyi’s voice rang out, the five peaks of the mystical sword sect-Qilin peak, Azure Dragon Peak, Vermilion Bird Peak, Black Tortoise peak, and white Tiger peak-started to shake slightly. Then, a beam of extremely bright light shot out from each of them.</p><p>The five rays of light gathered and formed a huge light screen formation, enveloping the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>Within the formation, endless sword Qi swam, protecting the mystical sword sect.</p><p>This formation had been destroyed by the Duanmu family from the inside during the battle at the mystical sword sect. Now, it had been completely repaired, and it was even more powerful than before.</p><p>“Hmph, you want to stop me? dream on!”</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly snorted as his bloodline power appeared. At the same time, a combat sword crackling with lightning appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! Qiu changkong shouted as he slashed out with his combat sword. A dazzling sword Qi of lightning slashed at the mystical sword sect’s protective formation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mystical sword sect’s protective formation trembled slightly. With a flash of light, it formed a sword Ray as large as a mountain. It flew out and collided with Qiu changkong’s sword Qi.</p><p>With a loud boom, the two sword radiances disappeared.</p><p>Everyone in the mystical sword sect heaved a sigh of relief. With the sect-protecting formation, it would not be easy for the other party to break through it.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Qiu changkong bellowed in rage, wanting to continue his attack.</p><p>“Junior Brother, let me do it!”</p><p>At this moment, a calm voice could be heard. Following that, Xue Chao stepped forward with his hands behind his back and appeared in front of Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Senior brother! It’s great that you’re here!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was overjoyed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xue Chao nodded his head and turned to look at the mystical sword sect. His eyes revealed a hint of disdain as he said,”It’s just a small formation, a child’s play. Who can it stop?”</p><p>After saying that, Xue Chao took another step forward and appeared in the sky above the mystical sword sect, looking down at the entire sect.</p><p>“Who is this person?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others were worried.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Right at this moment, Xue Chao’s aura completely erupted without the slightest restraint.</p><p>A vast and terrifying aura filled the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>When Lin Xueyi and the other half-step Kings sensed this aura, their faces went pale.</p><p>“A King, this is the aura of a King, this is a King!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted in shock, her eyes filled with shock.</p><p>“How could this be? Even the king tiers of the Empyrean heavens divine guards have been mobilized!”</p><p>Ling potian also roared.</p><p>“What? This was a King tier? Heavens, such a young king tier?”</p><p>“We’re finished, we’re finished!”</p><p>The mystical sword sect was in an uproar.</p><p>Countless shocked gazes looked at Xue Chao in the air.</p><p>When he saw the expressions of the people from the mystical sword sect, Xue Chao only felt his entire body relax, and his heart was extremely pleased.</p><p>He loved this kind of reverent expression.</p><p>“Just a small formation, break it for me!”</p><p>Xue Chao shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, the endless power of thunder and lightning between heaven and earth converged towards Xue Chao.</p><p>A thousand-meter long lightning sword appeared out of thin air and slashed down at the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Activate the formation, activate the formation, defend with all your might!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sect-protecting array shook violently. Endless light gathered and formed a shocking giant sword, which blasted towards the Thunderbolt sword that Xue Chao had slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud noise, but this time, the huge sword formed by the mystical sword sect’s sect-protecting formation collapsed instantly.</p><p>The giant lightning sword did not stop and continued to slash at the mystical sword sect’s protective formation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the mystical sword sect’s protective formation collapsed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Five consecutive explosions occurred on the Qilin peak and the other five peaks. Smoke and dust filled the air, and wails could be heard.</p><p>This was the explosion of the array base of the sect-protecting array. Those who controlled the array were either dead or injured.</p><p>Countless people from the mystical sword sect were dumbfounded as they looked at Xue Chao with incomparable fear.</p><p>Oh my God, the sect’s protective array has been broken. It was broken in one move!</p><p>“How can he be so strong? Is this the power of a King?”</p><p>Countless people cried out in horror.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the others all looked at Xue Chao, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p>It was too powerful. In front of this power, they were just ants.</p><p>Not only them, even Qiu Wuyang and the sun Legion’s powerhouses looked at Xue Chao with respect.</p><p>A King had already exceeded the limits of an ordinary person.</p><p>hahaha, what formation? he can’t even block one move from my senior brother!</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed heartily.</p><p>“Everyone, listen up! Prepare for battle!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted.</p><p>What could he do at this stage? Only a battle.</p><p>“Hmph, you guys want to fight me? you’re not even enough for me to kill. How about this, I’ll give you a chance. As long as you surrender, I’ll spare your lives. Who wants to surrender?”</p><p>Xue Chao sneered as he swept his gaze across the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>Some people’s eyes immediately flickered, clearly moved.</p><p>listen up, people of the mystical sword sect. We’d rather die than live in dishonor. If we surrender, we’ll be cursed for a thousand generations. I’d rather die than surrender.</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted.</p><p>“The people of my Crimson Cloud Valley would rather die than surrender!”</p><p>Ling potian also roared.</p><p>“The members of the imperial family will never surrender!”</p><p>Hua Chi also called out.</p><p>“Haha, good, very good. In that case, I’ll give you a few days to consider. If you want to surrender, you can come out and find me. If you don’t surrender when the time is up, I’ll kill you without mercy!”</p><p>When he said the last sentence, a terrifying killing intent burst out from Xue Chao’s body and enveloped the entire scene, causing many people to shiver.</p><p>“Surround the entire mystical sword sect and don’t let a single person escape!”</p><p>Xue Chao ordered Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>“Yes! Yes!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang quickly nodded.</p><p>Xue Chao then turned around and walked to Qiu changkong’s side.</p><p>“If Lu Ming is still alive, he’ll definitely rush over once he hears the news. We’ll give him a few days to come and die!”</p><p>Xue Chao said to Qiu changkong in a low voice.</p><p>“Senior brother is wise. With master’s arrangements, Lu Ming will be dead if he comes back alive. Haha, I really hope he’s not dead and can make it here. Then, I’ll kill his friends and family in front of him and make him regret offending me!”</p><p>Qiu changkong said through gritted teeth. His face was filled with cold resentment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
