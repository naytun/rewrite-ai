Surrounded by the civil and military officials and the city Lords, he was going to worship the heavens and the ancestors, and officially become the Emperor of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>After the meeting ended, it was time for a banquet to be held, inviting the entire world.</p><p>“The champion King, the defender-general of the state has arrived!”</p><p>“Lu family head, Madam Lu has arrived!”</p><p>A loud shout reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping walked in from outside.</p><p>“Your humble servant greets Your Majesty!”</p><p>“This commoner pays his respects to Your Majesty!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Hua Chi cupped their fists and saluted.</p><p>champion King, Uncle Lu, aunt Lu, please dispense with the formalities. Come, men, please take a seat!</p><p>Hua Chi hurriedly welcomed them and helped Lu Ming and the other two up.</p><p>Then, he sat down next to the three of them. It was the closest seat to him.</p><p>“The sect leader of the mystical sword sect has arrived!”</p><p>“The valley master of the Scarlet cloud Valley has arrived!”</p><p>Soon after, Lin Xueyi and Ling potian led a few gold-robed elders and a few young elites into the arena.</p><p>Everyone first paid their respects to Hua Chi, then presented their congratulatory gifts.</p><p>Following that, some of the smaller forces of the blazing sun Empire also sent people to greet the new emperor and present their gifts.</p><p>the blood Zhao Empire’s great sun Prefecture master has arrived!</p><p>All of a sudden, a loud shout silenced the entire place.</p><p>“The master of great sun Prefecture?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the others were shocked.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s expression was cold.</p><p>It was said that the great sun mansion master was one of the two kings in the blood Zhao Empire and had lived for hundreds of years.</p><p>Outside the square, an old man in a sun robe walked in with dozens of other old men and burly men.</p><p>jin yang, the master of great sun Prefecture, pays his respects to the new blazing sun Emperor!</p><p>&Nbsp; the great sun Prefecture master led the group and bowed to Hua Chi, then turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>great sun mansion, hehe, I haven’t even gone to find you, and you’ve already come to me!</p><p>Lu Ming stood up slowly, the aura on his body rising rapidly.</p><p>champion King, it’s all a misunderstanding. It’s all a misunderstanding!</p><p>&Nbsp; the great sun Prefecture master’s face changed and he shouted.</p><p>“Oh? A misunderstanding? Your great sun mansion’s 100000 strong sun Army is attacking the blazing sun Empire. Is this also a misunderstanding?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>champion King, it’s a misunderstanding. I was in seclusion at that time and had no idea what had happened. It was all because my subordinates were bewitched. As soon as I came out of seclusion and learned of this, I killed the sun Legion’s commander in chief. Today, I’m here to apologize to the champion King and all of you.</p><p>&Nbsp; the great sun mansion master quickly explained. He was really honest and didn’t have the dignity that a King should have.</p><p>Everyone knew in their hearts that this was all because of Lu Ming. If not for Lu Ming, the great sun Prefecture master would not have come to congratulate Hua Chi. Even if he had come, he would have come here to avenge the one hundred thousand sun Legion.</p><p>However, because of Lu Ming, the other party did not dare to say anything about the death of the one hundred thousand sun Legion. Instead, he came to apologize pitifully.</p><p>&Nbsp; after saying that, the great sun Prefecture master waved his hand and many boxes appeared on the ground. In the boxes were all kinds of spirit weapons, pills, and blacksmithing materials.</p><p>And they were all of high grade, many of them were level four.</p><p>champion King, this is a small gift from me. Please accept it!</p><p>The great sun Prefecture master laughed.</p><p>He was indeed very afraid. Previously, Lu Ming had killed many Kings in one battle, which made his heart shiver. He was afraid that if Lu Ming were to go to great sun mansion in anger, he would be finished.</p><p>He was only a first tier martial King and probably could not withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>The manor master of great sun Manor smiled apologetically and looked at Lu Ming with eager eyes.</p><p>This made the other people on the field feel a myriad of emotions.</p><p>In the past, the great sun Prefecture master was a legendary figure who was high up in the air and looked down on everyone.</p><p>They wanted to see him, but they couldn’t even see him.</p><p>Now, such a person was like a junior in front of Lu Ming. He was smiling cautiously. This made them feel strange.</p><p>Some of the young people were so excited that they were trembling. They clenched their fists and shouted in their hearts, ” this is what a true martial artist should be like. In the future, I’ll be like this too, so that I won’t live in vain!</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer immediately. He closed his eyes and seemed to be in deep thought.</p><p>The great sun Prefecture master just looked on, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes and said, today is a day of great joy for the burning sun Empire. I won’t hold it against you. But remember, if you dare to offend the burning sun Empire again, I will personally raze the great sun mansion to the ground!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent when he said the last sentence.</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of great sun mansion and the other higher-ups of great sun mansion broke out in cold sweat and their hearts turned cold.</p><p>“Thank you, champion King!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the people from great sun mansion cupped their fists and thanked him.</p><p>“You’re a guest, sit down!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>&Nbsp; the people from great sun mansion felt like they had been granted Amnesty and let out a long sigh of relief. They sat down.</p><p>the night Moon King of the nine nights Empire has arrived!</p><p>At this time, a loud shout was heard.</p><p>The entire place fell silent again.</p><p>The night Moon King of the nine nights Empire was also a martial King realm expert whose name shook the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. He was the number one expert in the nine nights Empire.</p><p>He didn’t expect that even such a person would come.</p><p>Hua Chi, Lin Xueyi, and the others were ecstatic as they quickly stood up to welcome him.</p><p>A tall and thin middle-aged man walked in with a group of people.</p><p>haha, ye Yue congratulates the new blazing sun Emperor on his ascension to the throne. Greetings, champion King!</p><p>The night Moon King bowed slightly to Hua Chi, then solemnly to Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone knew that the night Moon King had come for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Please sit, Night Moon King!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said.</p><p>“The sect master of the No return sect has arrived!”</p><p>“The Grand Supreme Leader of the carefree sect has arrived!”</p><p>“King Jinque has arrived!”</p><p>…</p><p>Following that, loud shouts could be heard.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked beyond words.</p><p>This was because the people who had come were all the overlords of the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. They were all martial King realm experts.</p><p>Every single one of them was an unrivaled figure in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. They were all legendary mighty people.</p><p>Usually, they were elusive, but now, they had actually come here together.</p><p>Finally, in the cloud Emperor mountain range, the Kings of the eight medium empires had almost all arrived. There were a total of fifteen of them.</p><p>One had to know that there were less than twenty Kings in all the 36 countries of Emperor Yun.</p><p>It could be said that most of the king tiers had arrived.</p><p>Everyone from the burning sun Empire was excited.</p><p>This was an honor and this honor was brought by Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone knew that these experts were here for Lu Ming.</p><p>A King tier who wasn’t even twenty years old was too shocking. His future was limitless, so they naturally had to curry favor with him as soon as possible and befriend him.</p><p>When Lu Ming became stronger in the future, they would not be qualified to befriend him even if they wanted to.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
