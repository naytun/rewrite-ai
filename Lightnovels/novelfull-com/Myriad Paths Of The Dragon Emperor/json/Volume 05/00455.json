If he wasn’t crazy, he must have eaten a flood Dragon’s gall.</p><p>...</p><p>Since ancient times, it was as rare as a Phoenix Feather or a Qilin horn for anyone below a King to challenge a King.</p><p>Almost everyone thought that Lu Ming must have been blinded by his own arrogance.</p><p>Even Xue Chao himself was stunned. Only after quite a while did he react. He said in a daze,”What? What did you just say? You want to challenge me?”</p><p>“That’s right. Could it be that you don’t dare to accept the challenge?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You don’t dare to accept the challenge? Hahaha, okay, I accept your challenge. I accept it 10000 times!”</p><p>Xue Chao was practically shouting.</p><p>He was too excited. He never expected that Lu Ming would challenge him. Was his head stuck between the door?</p><p>Originally, the Emperor sky divine Palace had a rule that King tiers were not allowed to challenge martial artists below King tiers. This was because the gap between them was too great. There was no suspense at all, and it would be a complete torture.</p><p>Even if a King tier took the initiative to challenge him, any martial artist below the king tier could refuse.</p><p>Therefore, when The Guardian stopped him, he felt helpless and did not take the initiative to challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, even if he challenged Lu Ming, Lu Ming would reject him.</p><p>He would never have dreamed that Lu Ming would actually challenge him? This was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Beside them, Qiu changkong was so excited that he was trembling. are you looking for death? hahaha, Lu Ming is looking for death.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, let’s fight on the divine Guard platform!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took the lead and flew towards the divine Guard platform.</p><p>Xue Chao and Qiu changkong hurriedly followed after him, as if they were afraid that Lu Ming would run away.</p><p>this is going to be a good show. Hurry up and send a message to Junior Brother. It’s rare to see someone below the king tier challenge a King tier.</p><p>“Quick, I’ll also send a voice transmission!”</p><p>The hundreds of people at the scene sent voice transmissions to those they were familiar with, asking them to come and take a look.</p><p>Then, they followed Lu Ming and the rest as they flew toward the divine Guard platform.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space trembled, and a tall figure appeared. It was none other than the protector from before.</p><p>“Interesting, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The next moment, the figure disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight as he flew.</p><p>The reason why he challenged Xue Chao wasn’t because he was hot-headed, but because he had thought it through.</p><p>In his heart, he had a crazy plan.</p><p>He intended to borrow Xue Chao’s power to fuse the wind, fire, and lightning intents.</p><p>Yes, he needed external help.</p><p>In the past, he had experienced the same thing. The reason why he was able to successfully merge his Wind and Fire forces was because he had borrowed the pressure from Qiu changlie during his battle with him.</p><p>He was going to repeat the same old trick.</p><p>And Xue Chao, without a doubt, was a very good target.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could kill a bunch of ordinary half-step Kings with one move. It was not challenging at all.</p><p>And he had no confidence in challenging those old king tiers.</p><p>As for Xue Chao, it was obvious that he had just broken through to the king’s realm. His strength wasn’t considered strong among King’s, so he was just enough to fight him.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the divine Guard platform.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming appeared on the divine guards platform.</p><p>Xue Chao also followed him down the divine guards platform.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the space suddenly trembled. Then, a few figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Hall Master, the hall Master has arrived.”</p><p>Wind Palace Master, Fire Palace Master, Thunder Palace Master, and gold Palace Master. Four Palace Masters have come all at once.</p><p>it’s too rare for a King below King to challenge a King. It’s normal for the palace Master to be attracted here.</p><p>The arrival of the palace Masters in the sky immediately caused a series of exclamations.</p><p>“Haha, you guys are fast!”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard, and another figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>This figure was tall and sturdy. Although he had a head full of white hair, he was still in high spirits.</p><p>“The palace Master of earth has also arrived.”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Five of the nine Palace Masters had arrived, which was more than half of the total number.</p><p>“Disciple greets master!”</p><p>Seeing the arrival of the Thunder Palace Master, Xue Chao revealed a happy expression. He flew into the sky and saluted the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>yes, I already know the whole story. Since Lu Ming is so arrogant, you should teach him a good lesson and let him remember.</p><p>The lightning Palace Master said indifferently.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s face revealed a look of great joy. Then, he left the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds rang out as figures rushed over from all directions of the Emperor heaven divine Palace like ants.</p><p>After a while, more than 10000 people appeared near the divine guards ‘fighting stage.</p><p>From this, it could be seen how much of a stir this challenge had caused.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you should feel honored that so many people have come to see you being abused.”</p><p>Xue Chao laughed.</p><p>we haven’t fought yet. I advise you not to be happy too early. If you lose to me, it’ll be a big embarrassment.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You defeated me? Haha, Lu Ming, you really came up with this idea. There must be something wrong with your brain. There’s no such possibility.”</p><p>Xue Chao laughed wildly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He shifted his gaze and suddenly smiled.”Xue Chao, how about this? since you’re so confident, why don’t we have a little wager?”</p><p>“A wager? What do you want to bet on?”</p><p>Xue Chao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming still wanted to bet on the auspicious item. Wasn’t that giving him money? How could he not agree?</p><p>“I’ll use this to bet with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a sword-shaped plant appeared in the air, floating in front of him.</p><p>As soon as the sword-shaped plant appeared, it released a terrifying sword intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword-shaped plant’s nine leaves were like a godly sword. They made a clanging sound and nine sword lights shot up into the sky.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Even Lu Ming himself was dumbfounded.</p><p>Previously, when the sword-shaped plant was on the hundred deities slope, there was no such phenomenon. He did not expect that it would emit such a terrifying phenomenon when it came out. It was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Around them, the others were also dumbfounded and tongue-tied.</p><p>“What, what kind of spiritual herb is this? it actually has such a strange phenomenon?”</p><p>what a powerful sword intent. It’s too powerful and mysterious. One of the sword techniques I’m practicing is actually showing signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>“Treasure, this is a real treasure!”</p><p>Some people in the surroundings let out excited roars.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the five Palace Masters released even more terrifying energy waves. They all stared at the sword-shaped plant with wide eyes.</p><p>“This is … After the death of a Supreme expert, the sword intent did not dissipate. After countless years and by chance, this spiritual herb was born, and it contains a trace of the Supreme expert’s sword Dao!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Treasure, Supreme treasure!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire said in a trembling voice.</p><p>how did this kid get such a treasure? I’m definitely going to get it.</p><p>The eyes of the Thunder Palace Master flickered with intense greed.</p><p>Lu Ming, how about selling this sword-shaped plant to me? I’ll pay 60000 Supreme spiritual crystals!</p><p>The gold Palace Master was the first to speak.</p><p>“60000 crystals? I’ll pay 80000 high quality spiritual crystals.”</p><p>The palace Master of fire shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll buy your sword-shaped plant for 100000 top-grade spirit crystals.”</p><p>The wind Palace Master also spoke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
