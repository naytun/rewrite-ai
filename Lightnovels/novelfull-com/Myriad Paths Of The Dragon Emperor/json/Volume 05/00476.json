They seemed to be extremely furious and were rolling crazily, as if they were going to use all their strength to destroy the two ants below.</p><p>“No, no, how could this be? Why isn’t it over yet? You can’t do this, you can’t do this!”</p><p>The black-robed young man was scared out of his wits when he saw this scene. He let out a terrified scream.</p><p>However, the next moment …</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The lightning struck.</p><p>This time, the power of the lightning was several times stronger than before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, both of his bloodlines and the wind and Fire concepts burst forth. Lu Ming held the spear and kept blasting at the lightning that was falling from the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently with every bolt of lightning that struck him. His muscles and bones trembled as if they were about to be torn apart.</p><p>Some of the Thunderbolts struck the Thunder concept runes, causing them to twist and shake crazily as if they would collapse at any moment.</p><p>“Hang in there, you must hang in there!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and tried his best to resist.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward and a three-colored vacuum flew out. However, it dissipated after being struck by a few Thunderbolts. Then, the Thunderbolts struck Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His body was struck and fell to the ground, creating a huge pit on the ground.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming rushed out of the pit and continued to resist.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few more strikes of lightning, cracks appeared on Lu Ming’s body, and beads of blood seeped out.</p><p>The seventh wave of lightning was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming was miserable, but the black-robed young man was even worse.</p><p>He screamed again and again, and a large amount of mist came out of his body. Blood spurted out of his mouth, and smoke rose from his body. His body was almost shattered, and there were charred pits all over it. His flesh was a mess.</p><p>Behind him, his body was almost split into two. His bones and internal organs could even be seen.</p><p>Those who cultivated evil martial arts were most afraid of lightning, and it was much more difficult for them to pass tribulations than other martial artists. At this time, they were naturally in a miserable state.</p><p>However, the black-robed young man was indeed powerful. His vitality was extremely vigorous. He had managed to survive this. However, his injuries were extremely serious.</p><p>He had almost died.</p><p>When the lightning dissipated, he flew away with all his might. A resentful shout reverberated in the sky.</p><p>“Little bastard, if I don’t get my revenge, I’m not a human!</p><p>The voice disappeared, and the person also left.</p><p>At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky finally dispersed, and the world returned to peace.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>Lu Ming let out a few long breaths.</p><p>The lightning tribulation became more powerful as it went on. By the seventh round, Lu Ming was almost unable to withstand it.</p><p>everyone else has three rounds, but I actually have seven!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>However, the benefits were self-evident. Lu Ming’s concept runes were bright and shining like a crystal-clear purple jade.</p><p>Most importantly, his intent symbol was actually two inches long. This was already the initial success of a first level intent.</p><p>The cultivation of intent of ordinary lower tier Kings was only at this realm.</p><p>He had just passed the lightning tribulation, and his intent realm had already reached level one lower tier. If others were to see this, they would be scared to death.</p><p>Not far away, there was really a person, the bald man.</p><p>At this moment, he was not dead yet. He looked at Lu Ming in disbelief and shouted in horror, ” how is this possible? how is this possible? ”</p><p>He had cultivated for decades, but the concept runes were only an inch long. Compared to Lu Ming, there was a huge difference.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He sat cross-legged and circulated the true war Dragon technique at full force.</p><p>At this moment, it was time for the final crucial stone inscription.</p><p>After being tempered by the lightning, the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body had been completely transformed into essential core. It was a 100% transformation.</p><p>At the same time, the Qi cyclone in his dantian began to spin crazily. The spirit Qi between heaven and earth was gathering towards Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>However, this amount of spiritual energy was far from enough.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and piles of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared in the surroundings.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s arm shook and suddenly-</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At least 20000 Supreme spiritual crystals exploded, and endless spiritual Qi gushed out.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and sucked in the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth.</p><p>The heaven and earth Spirit Qi was constantly being transformed into essential core. The essential core in Lu Ming’s body began to increase rapidly and became more robust.</p><p>Now, although Lu Ming had broken through to a higher realm, the amount of essential core in his body had not caught up. Now, he had to replenish his essential core.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming cultivated the true war Dragon technique to the ninth level. His essential core was extremely rich, and the amount of spirit Qi He needed was simply too much.</p><p>The 20,000 pieces of spiritual crystals were used up very quickly. Lu Ming took out another 20000 pieces of spiritual crystals.</p><p>He continued to devour and refine it.</p><p>The essential core in Lu Ming’s body continued to increase. The aura that he emitted was also becoming more and more powerful.</p><p>This was the aura of a King.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming finished devouring 20000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals and took out another 20000 pieces. He did it eight times in total.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming had devoured and refined a total of 160000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>What a terrifying number this was?</p><p>Not far away, the bald burly man was almost scared to death. He looked at Lu Ming with a dazed gaze and mumbled, freak, this is a freak. I shouldn’t have listened to Thunder Palace master’s bewitchment to deal with such a freak. Thunder Palace Master, even if I didn’t kill him now, you will die sooner or later. Haha!</p><p>The bald man laughed. After a while, his aura rapidly weakened. He had died just like that.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stood up, his eyes glimmering with excitement.</p><p>“Martial King, is this the martial King realm? Too strong! The gap between a half step King and a martial King is like a hundred thousand miles. No wonder people say that all those below the martial King realm are ants!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the vast and endless essential core in his body and sighed.</p><p>His true essence was now ten times stronger than before.</p><p>Moreover, it was 100% pure. When it was activated, there was no obscurity at all.</p><p>“My physical body has also reached complete grade six!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that after going through the tempering of the lightning tribulation, his physical body had improved a step further. He had reached the perfected sixth-grade physical body and was only one step away from the seventh-grade physical body.</p><p>the most important thing is the intent realm!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and realized that a two-inch-long concept rune was floating quietly in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his palm and grabbed at the air. Instantly, the power of lightning between heaven and earth gathered wildly in Lu Ming’s palm. In the blink of an eye, a long spear completely condensed from lightning appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Zzzzzzzz</p><p>The lightning flickered, and the air was filled with a burning smell. Even the air was burnt by the lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the lightning Spear turned into a flash of lightning and flew into the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it flew out of the deep pit and above the clouds before exploding.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky was filled with lightning.</p><p>first level Thunder concept, initial success! So powerful! So powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
