That was the intent realm grasped by a King at the initial completion. Of course, it was powerful.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming had mastered it now.</p><p>“How strong is my current combat power? It shouldn’t be a problem to defeat a Lv 2 martial King realm martial artist!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>In the martial King realm, the gap between each level was huge. It was too difficult to fight above one’s level.</p><p>Moreover, those who could break through to the martial King realm usually had to go through at least three battles.</p><p>In other words, any random martial King would have won three battles when he was a martial arts Grandmaster.</p><p>Even those who had reached level four or five during the martial ancestor realm could not fight above their level after breaking through to the martial King realm.</p><p>At most, he would be an outstanding talent among those of the same level.</p><p>Those who could still fight above their level after breaking through to the martial King realm were definitely rare monsters.</p><p>Lu Ming was now at the early stage of the first level of the martial King realm. With the true war Dragon technique, the fusion of three wills, and the three absolutes of the Dragon God, he was absolutely confident that he could defeat, or even kill, a peak second level martial King realm martial artist.</p><p>In addition to his Thunder concept of level one lower tier, Lu Ming’s combat strength would be even more terrifying.</p><p>Lv 3 martial King realm. I should be able to fight him, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>After all, the martial King realm was too unfamiliar to Lu Ming. He had not fought before, so he could not judge.</p><p>“If I can condense my Wind and Fire intent into intent runes, then my battle power will be truly strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>However, it wasn’t something that could be done overnight. It had to be done step by step to condense the intent of Wind and Fire into intent runes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in front of the bald man.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the bald man’s storage ring. At the same time, a powerful devouring power erupted and devoured the bald man’s blood essence.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, Xue Chao, just you wait. This time, if I don’t kill the both of you, I’m not a human!”</p><p>With a low growl, Lu Ming’s body shot up into the sky. He turned into a flash of lightning and rushed madly towards the cloud Emperor mountain range and the burning sun Empire.</p><p>He refined the bald man’s blood essence as he traveled.</p><p>He didn’t absorb the blood Essence’s energy and turn it into vital essence. Instead, he used all the power of the blood essence to improve his bloodline.</p><p>The blood essence of a peak Lv 1 martial King realm martial artist was too rich.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodlines were being refined crazily. His entire body was shimmering with a blood-red light, and the five silver chakra were constantly flashing with a silver light, which was extremely dazzling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a long while, another chakra appeared in the body of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The sixth silver chakra.</p><p>King level sixth rank bloodline.</p><p>The sixth Meridian cycle of the nine Dragon bloodline was light silver at first, then its color gradually darkened. Finally, it turned dark silver like the other five Meridian cycles before it stopped.</p><p>Only then did the bald man’s blood essence run out.</p><p>The bald man’s blood essence had increased Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian by an entire level.</p><p>if a few more of them come, won’t my bloodline be able to rise to the seventh or eighth level of the king tier? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought excitedly and then shook his head.</p><p>Bloodline, the further one advanced, the harder it was to improve.</p><p>Especially from the sixth level to the seventh level, there was a huge gap.</p><p>There were many people with sixth level king class bloodlines, but there were very few who had seventh level king class bloodlines.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming was on his way at full speed.</p><p>However, he didn’t use the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, because it consumed too much vital essence and wasn’t good for long-term travel.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast.</p><p>The endless mountains and rivers swept past Lu Ming. He was like a bolt of lightning, flying across the sky.</p><p>A few martial Grandmaster powerhouses were flying in the sky when they suddenly felt a flash of lightning above their heads.</p><p>What followed was a series of sonic booms. After that, a violent gust of wind blew in their faces, almost blowing a few martial arts grandmasters away.</p><p>it’s so powerful. What is that thing? it’s just flying, but it’s already causing such a terrifying aura? ”</p><p>A younger martial arts Grandmaster’s expression changed.</p><p>a King! That’s definitely a King! And it’s no ordinary King! It’s too powerful!</p><p>A white-haired old man said in a deep voice.</p><p>The few of them gasped and looked in the direction that Lu Ming flew in with some reverence.</p><p>Thousands of miles of land flitted past under Lu Ming’s feet as he headed toward the blazing sun Empire at high speed.</p><p>However, this place was too far away from the blazing sun Empire. Even with Lu Ming’s current speed, he would need at least five days to get there.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blazing sun Empire, in the mystical sword sect’s meeting hall, the higher-ups of the mystical sword sect, the higher-ups of the Crimson Cloud Valley, Hua Chi, and the others were all seated. However, the atmosphere was extremely heavy.</p><p>This was because a few days ago, the omnidirectional sword sect had suddenly sent out an Army and launched a fierce attack on the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley.</p><p>For a moment, the Alliance Army of the mystical sword sect, Hua Chi, and Crimson Cloud Valley was defeated and could not resist at all.</p><p>The powerhouses of the major forces had also suffered heavy casualties. They had no choice but to continuously withdraw their forces.</p><p>In the past few days, the Shifang sword sect’s Army had almost reached the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Now, the Crimson Cloud Valley had completely abandoned their Mountain Gate and all of them had come to the mystical sword sect to resist the attack of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>“How could this be? Why did the ten direction Sword school’s military strength suddenly become so much stronger?”</p><p>Ling potian, the valley master of the Crimson Cloud Valley, slammed the table and roared.</p><p>most importantly, there’s an additional Army in the Army of the omnidirectional sword sect. There are a total of 100000 people. They’re too powerful. Even the bloodred scaled Wolf Army can’t stop them!</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were extremely solemn as he spoke.</p><p>it’s said that the Army is wearing a battle suit with a sun embroidered on it. It’s confirmed that they are the sun Army from the great sun mansion of the blood Zhao Empire!</p><p>Lin Xueyi sighed and said.</p><p>The moment he said that, the atmosphere became even more solemn.</p><p>it’s really the great sun family’s sun Legion. But why would the great sun family send troops to help the ten direction Sword School? ”</p><p>Ling potian called out.</p><p>Qiu changkong is probably the only one who can make the great sun House send troops to help the ten direction sword sect. He’s using his identity as an Emperor sky Divine Guard, so the great sun House has no choice but to give him face!</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s brows furrowed even more.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, how dare he? Aren’t you afraid that Lu Ming will run away?”</p><p>At this point, Ling potian stopped, and a bad premonition flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>Qiu changkong dared to attack. Could something have happened to Lu Ming?</p><p>“No, brother Lu is a genius. How can something happen to him so easily?”</p><p>Hua Chi shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>However, the atmosphere was still tense. Although they didn’t want to believe it, it was a fact that Qiu changkong had led his Army to attack.</p><p>“No matter what, we have to defend this place!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi gritted her teeth.</p><p>At this moment, a figure ran in in a panic and shouted, ” not good, sect leader! Qiu Wuyang, the sect leader of the Shifang sword sect, has already arrived outside the mountain Gate with a group of elite soldiers!</p><p>“What? So fast?”</p><p>Everyone in the hall was shocked.</p><p>“Gather everyone and defend against the enemy with me!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted, and everyone headed towards the mountain Gate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
