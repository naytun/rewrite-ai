Lu Ming was really going to kill him.</p><p>...</p><p>He was extremely bold.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent. A spear appeared in his hand. The spear turned into a bolt of lightning and pierced the air. It brought with it a terrifying force as it pierced toward Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Argh! No, no, save me!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s courage was almost shattered. His body, which was like a pile of mud, trembled violently as he let out a hysterical scream.</p><p>He was screaming so miserably that he was on the verge of tears.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a scorching wave flashed past. Lu Ming’s spear gleam suddenly disappeared.</p><p>It disappeared without a trace.</p><p>A tall figure appeared on the fighting ring. It was the middle-aged protector.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the rules can’t be broken. If you break them, it’ll be very difficult for you to join the Ditian Divine Guard if you kill him now. You have to know the priority of this matter!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He knew that he would not be able to kill Qiu changkong today with the middle-aged protector around. He cupped his fists and said,”Lu Ming knows!”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector nodded.</p><p>hahaha, I’m saved. Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’ll definitely take revenge. I’ll take revenge ten times, a hundred times more!</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed and roared in his heart, his eyes flashing with extreme hatred.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had embarrassed and humiliated him in front of so many people. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“Men, carry them down to treat their injuries!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>A few people immediately flew down and carried Qiu changkong and zang Sheng away.</p><p>I hereby announce that the eastern sky divine guards belong to Lu Ming!</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The entire place was in an uproar. Countless people were discussing and discussing.</p><p>it’s a surprise. It’s really a surprise. Lu Ming actually won the throne of the eastern sky divine guards!</p><p>that’s right. I would never have thought that after so many years, another genius from a small region would be able to become one of the four divine guards.</p><p>a genius from a small area fighting for the four divine guards. It’s so rare. It only happens once every five hundred years. I didn’t expect to see it. I’m so lucky!</p><p>so handsome. Lu Ming is so handsome. I want to woo him!</p><p>A young girl in the prime of her youth shrieked, her eyes shining.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Lu Ming had fought against two opponents and had an overwhelming victory. Everyone was taken aback.</p><p>At the elder-in-charge area.</p><p>“Brother Lu, brother Lu, congratulations! Lu Ming has won the title of the eastern sky Divine Guard!”</p><p>that’s right. Brother Lu really has a good eye for talent. Such a genius was found by brother Lu. He even hid so deeply before!</p><p>“Brother Lu, please take care of this little brother in the future!”</p><p>The group of elders beside Lu Xiu all beamed with joy as they congratulated him.</p><p>No, this was no longer congratulatory, it was simply flattery.</p><p>“You’re welcome, you’re welcome!”</p><p>Lu Xiu replied to them one by one, but his smile was so wide that it almost reached his ears.</p><p>Not far away, Zhao sui’s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. His eyes were full of disbelief, and he kept muttering, ” “How could this be? How did it end up like this?”</p><p>In the reserve area of the Empyrean heaven divine guards, Jiang hongwen and Shangguan Yunyan’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Lu Ming took over the eastern sky divine guards? My cloud Emperor mountain range’s people actually seized the eastern heaven divine guards?”</p><p>Jiang hongwen kept muttering to himself, thinking that he was dreaming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re amazing, you’re amazing. I’m far inferior to him!”</p><p>In the Ditian divine guards ‘area, Jian Fengyun sighed. However, he was not jealous at all. Instead, he was happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the middle-aged protector took a step forward and came before Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not bad. You’ve exceeded my expectations. However, there are many geniuses in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. You can’t be arrogant because of this!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector said with a smile.</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, Guardian!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>He knew that the middle-aged Guardian had no ill intentions towards him. On the contrary, he had good intentions. The reason why he had stopped Qiu changkong’s death was to maintain the rules.</p><p>yes. If you have any problems in the future, you can look for me at the palace of fire. In a while, there will be a Deacon of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace who will bring you to tour the branch Palace of the myriad Star City. Your rewards will also be distributed to you!</p><p>The middle-aged protector said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks, protector!” Lu Ming expressed his gratitude again.</p><p>The middle-aged protector nodded in satisfaction, then announced loudly, ” alright, this Ditian Divine Guard selection ends here. The eastern sky Divine Guard has selected a total of 1360 official Ditian divine guards. Deacon Huang, I’ll leave the rest to you!</p><p>As soon as the middle-aged protector finished speaking, a tall and thin middle-aged man with a goatee flew into the fighting ring and said, ” “This subordinate will do as you command!”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector nodded. Then, his body moved and he suddenly disappeared. No one could see how he disappeared.</p><p>“Is this the power of a lower tier King tier?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a look of yearning.</p><p>The martial King realm was also divided into nine levels, but the gap between each level was even greater.</p><p>It was several times greater than the gap between each stage of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Moreover, there were several dividing lines in the martial King realm. According to these dividing lines, there were four titles.</p><p>From Lv 1 to Lv 3 martial King realm, they were known as low-tier Kings.</p><p>From Lv 4 to Lv 6 martial King realm, they were known as Kings of lower tier.</p><p>From Lv 7 to Lv 9 martial King realm, they were known as Kings of the upper tier.</p><p>And above the late-stage King tier, there was still one known as a peak-stage King tier.</p><p>Among them, the third to fourth level and the sixth to the seventh level of the martial King realm were all dividing lines, and the difference in strength was huge.</p><p>It was said that the Guardians of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were all lower tier Kings.</p><p>It was very difficult to break through to the next level of the martial King realm. In the eastern branch of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, most of the king tiers were low-tier King tiers, while lower tier King tiers were already famous experts.</p><p>alright, the Emperor sky divine guards will stay here temporarily. Someone will make the arrangements later. Official Emperor sky divine guards, follow me. I’ll bring you to the Emperor sky divine Palace to settle the procedures and arrange your accommodation!</p><p>“Everyone, my surname is Huang, and I’m an attendant of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. You can call me attendant Huang!”</p><p>The goateed Deacon said.</p><p>Immediately after, attendant Huang took the lead and soared into the sky. Below him, the 1360 people who had officially become Ditian divine guards also soared into the sky and followed attendant Huang.</p><p>Below, countless eyes were looking at them, full of envy.</p><p>Once one became an official Ditian Divine Guard, not only would they be able to enjoy superior cultivation conditions, but they would also possess great power and a high status.</p><p>If he were to go to those empires, even the royal families of medium or upper tier empires would have to be polite to him, let alone a low-tier Empire like the burning sun Empire.</p><p>This was because the Empyrean heaven divine guards represented the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group flew high into the sky and looked down. The entire huge building was in their sight.</p><p>In the other three directions, light flickered, as if the other three divine guards had not been decided yet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
