Instead, he charged at Lu Ming frantically.</p><p>...</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The war spear flew across the sky and instantly pierced through a distance of a few thousand meters, heading towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>On the other side, Xue Chao and Qiu changkong were already shrieking in fear as they flew away frantically. They didn’t dare to stop for a moment.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was simply a devil.</p><p>“It’s too late to escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. With a thought, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The man and the spear became one, turning into an extreme attack.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>When Lu Ming’s figure reappeared, there was a large hole in the one-eyed man’s chest.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his strongest attack and killed the one-eyed man in one move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. Lu Ming opened his mouth and sucked. The blood essence of the one-eyed man and the others was all devoured by him.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming took a step forward and chased after Xue Chao.</p><p>In the next moment, he appeared in front of Xue Chao.</p><p>“Ah, no!”</p><p>Xue Chao was so scared that he almost peed his pants. His face was pale as he frantically retreated.</p><p>“Xue Chao, I’ve said it before. Today, you must die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and filled with killing intent.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming, don’t kill me. If you kill me, my master will definitely not let you off. It won’t do you any good!”</p><p>Xue Chao shouted in fear.</p><p>don’t worry. It won’t be long before that old dog, the Thunder Palace Master, will also go down to accompany you.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he thrust his spear.</p><p>“Argh! “Ah!” No!”</p><p>Xue Chao roared crazily and exploded with all his strength, wanting to block it.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through him and all his resistance turned into ashes.</p><p>Blood spurted out as Xue Chao was pierced by the spear.</p><p>Xue Chao, dead!</p><p>At the same time, Xue Chao’s blood essence was devoured by Lu Ming, and his storage ring was taken away.</p><p>Then, he turned around and disappeared.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s face was pale, and his lips trembled as he tried his best to fly away.</p><p>However, the next moment, a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Argh! Lu Ming, don’t kill me. ”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared.</p><p>His entire body trembled non-stop, and cold sweat poured down his face.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Just as Qiu changkong’s face lit up with joy, Lu Ming continued, ” because the person who should kill you shouldn’t be me!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked Qiu changkong’s dantian. A violent force gushed into his dantian and the Qi cyclone in his dantian was destroyed. As soon as the Qi cyclone was destroyed, Qiu changkong’s cultivation was crippled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve crippled my cultivation. Ah, you’ve crippled my cultivation. You animal, you animal!”</p><p>Qiu changkong let out a cry of despair.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Qiu changkong and sent him flying for dozens of miles, landing above the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Take him down!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted in excitement.</p><p>An expert immediately flew out and captured Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Wuyang and the sun Army’s experts were all scared out of their wits. They roared madly and wanted to retreat.</p><p>But how could an Army move so quickly?</p><p>“Today, none of you shall think of leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure appeared in the sky above the sun Legion.</p><p>King, please spare us. We’re from the great sun mansion. The old ancestor of our great sun mansion is also a King …</p><p>An armored general roared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s response was a punch.</p><p>This punch contained an endless amount of Thunder Power, and it immediately exploded.</p><p>??…</p><p>In the sky, countless bolts of lightning flashed. Below, the sun Army’s soldiers screamed. In an instant, at least thousands of sun Army soldiers were struck to death by lightning.</p><p>Including the few half-step Kings in the lead, they were all killed.</p><p>attack! Everyone, attack! Annihilate the ten direction sword sect and the sun Army!</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted.</p><p>“Everyone, attack!”</p><p>Ling potian also roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Figures rushed out from the mystical sword sect and headed for the ten direction sword sect and the sun Army.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The martial artists below the martial arts Grandmaster realm also roared in anger and charged out of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, the head of the ten directions sword sect, let out a shrill cry and ran away. He couldn’t care about the other people from the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>Even if everyone died, how could it compare to his life?</p><p>However, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang shouted in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath. He kicked Qiu Wuyang’s dantian and Qiu Wuyang followed in Qiu changkong’s footsteps.</p><p>??…</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and dozens of lightning Spears appeared. The next moment, they shot out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In the Army of the omnidirectional sword sect and the sun Legion, all the martial artists above the 9th level of the martial Grandmaster realm were killed by the lightning Spear.</p><p>After killing these people, Lu Ming did not make any more moves. He stood quietly in the void and began to refine the blood essence of the one-eyed man and the others.</p><p>With the death of the senior executives of the ten direction sword sect and the sun Army, the rest were like a pile of loose sand. They were no match for Lin Xueyi and the others at all. It was a one-sided slaughter.</p><p>Therefore, there was no need for Lu Ming to take action.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The blood essence of the one-eyed man and the others was extremely rich. Lu Ming converted half of it into essential core and used the other half to improve his second bloodline.</p><p>A moment later, the second bloodline trembled and the sixth silver chakra appeared.</p><p>His second bloodline had also advanced to the sixth level of the king class.</p><p>After a while, the second bloodline reached the limit of the sixth level of the king class.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had also increased a little, reaching the peak of the early phase of the first level of the martial King realm.</p><p>one Lv 3 martial King realm, four Lv 2 martial King realm, and one Lv 1 martial King realm, but they only helped me improve my cultivation by this little.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>It seemed like he would need even more resources to raise his cultivation after breaking through to the martial King realm.</p><p>Not far away, the battle cries shook the heavens, but it was a completely one-sided situation.</p><p>Not long after, the sounds of fighting died down. Only a few of the people from the ten direction sword sect and the sun Legion had escaped. Most of them had been killed.</p><p>This was especially so for the higher-ups of the ten directions sword sect and the heavenly fiend sect.</p><p>This time, in order to destroy the mystic essence sword sect in one fell swoop, the ten directions sword sect had sent out ninth level experts and eighth level experts from the heavenly fiend sect. In this battle, they were completely annihilated.</p><p>This included the sect leaders of the ten directions sword sect and the heavenly fiend sect.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over.</p><p>“Golden Eye!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The Golden-eyed blood corpse was wrapped in a thick blood aura. The blood aura gathered and formed a huge blood cocoon in the air.</p><p>“The Golden Eye just absorbed the blood of the one-eyed man and the others. After absorbing the king’s blood, it seems like it’s going to evolve again.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At that moment, the sound of something breaking through the air rang out. Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Shangguan Ming, Yan Quan, and the rest appeared not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu … No, I pay my respects to the king!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi initially wanted to call out to Lu Ming, but she immediately reacted and bowed with cupped fists.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord King!”</p><p>The others also bowed and cupped their fists.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
