They only killed the higher-ups of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>...</p><p>Most of them were martial artists above the great Martial Master realm. They didn’t kill those below the great Martial Master realm.</p><p>That was because martial artists below the rank of a martial Grandmaster were not a big threat.</p><p>Very quickly, the ten direction sword sect quieted down.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the omnipresent Sword School calmly, his face expressionless.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, killing was a daily affair. Every day, sects were destroyed, and new sects rose. It was very normal.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent for a moment. He then turned around and left in the air.</p><p>Next, there was no need for him to make a move.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the rest were more than enough to take down Tian Sha sect.</p><p>Most of the upper echelons of the heavenly fiend sect had died in the mystical sword sect, so they could not stop Lin Xueyi and the others.</p><p>Stepping on the air, Lu Ming traveled a thousand miles in an instant and headed towards the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Soon, he returned to the mystical sword sect.</p><p>“Goldeneye, after this evolution, he’s probably going to enter the king’s realm!”</p><p>In the air in front of the mystical sword sect’s Mountain Gate, Lu Ming looked at the blood cocoon suspended in the air and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming moved and flew toward the depths of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at Lu Yuntian’s courtyard.</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were drinking tea and chatting.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had become a King and his name was known throughout the world, the two of them were very happy and always had smiles on their faces.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the door open and entered, calling out softly.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’re back? Quickly sit down!”</p><p>Li Ping said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming sat down.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, why don’t I see miss nianqing this time?”</p><p>Li Ping asked.</p><p>In the past, everyone knew that Xie nianqing was always by Lu Ming’s side. Later on, Xie nianqing followed Lu Ming to take part in the Ditian Divine Guard assessment. Many people thought that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were a couple.</p><p>Li Ping and Lu Yuntian were quite fond of Xie nianqing, so they were naturally very concerned about him.</p><p>“Father, mother, miss Xie has other matters to attend to, so she didn’t return to the blazing sun Empire,”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At the mention of Xie nianqing, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with mixed emotions. He was very worried.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no clues at all.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, did you guys fight? Sometimes, a man should give in to a girl. You have to learn from your father!”</p><p>Li Ping said earnestly.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>By the side, Lu Yuntian coughed a few times.</p><p>“Father, mother, it’s nothing. Miss Xie is just busy. Oh, that’s right!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming waved his hand and more than ten Jade bottles appeared on the table.</p><p>father, mother, these pills can nourish the body, replenish blood and Qi, and prolong life. Although they can’t repair father’s meridians, they can still have a nourishing effect!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping kept the pills happily. They knew that Lu Ming had reached the martial King realm, so these pills were not of much use to him.</p><p>From then on, Lu Ming would take time out to visit Lu Yuntian and Li Ping every day. He would spend the rest of his time cultivating.</p><p>After entering the martial King realm, his understanding of martial arts had greatly improved.</p><p>His comprehension of martial arts techniques was also greatly accelerated.</p><p>Lu Ming had already cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to the limit of the second step. Seven days later, he successfully cultivated the third step.</p><p>With three steps, the power of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps increased by more than ten times, reaching the sixth level of the heaven grade low level martial technique.</p><p>In terms of power, it was no weaker than the third level of the three wonders of Dragon Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming had another killer move.</p><p>During these seven days, the burning sun Empire was in a state of shock.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect and the heavenly fiend sect were destroyed, and the eighth prince killed the heavenly suppression King and took back the imperial capital.</p><p>Every single one of them was enough to shake the entire blazing sun Empire.</p><p>The most shocking news was the return of the Marquis champion, Lu Ming, who had reached the martial King realm. Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>After that, wherever the mystic essence sword sect, Crimson Cloud Valley, and the imperial family’s armies passed, the factions that belonged to the ten directions sword sect and heavenly fiend sect surrendered.</p><p>There was almost no intense battle.</p><p>Half a month later, the entire burning sun Empire was under the control of the mystical sword sect, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and the royal family.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire had been unified like never before.</p><p>As the saying went, a country could not go a day without a ruler. At this moment, many people suggested that Hua Chi should inherit the throne and become the Emperor of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>However, Hua Chi did not agree. He used the fact that the blazing sun Empire had just experienced a Great War as an excuse to refuse.</p><p>After two days, everyone tried to persuade Hua Chi again, but he still refused.</p><p>At this moment, someone came to Lu Ming, hoping that he could persuade Hua Chi to ascend the throne.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and made a trip to the imperial capital. After that, the imperial family announced to the world that Hua Chi would officially ascend the throne in the imperial capital in a month’s time.</p><p>At the same time, the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley were named the two Holy Lands of martial arts in the burning sun Empire.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming was conferred the title of champion King and the defender-general of the state.</p><p>The Lu family was given the title of a first-class family, on par with noble families.</p><p>The news spread and attracted worldwide attention.</p><p>Countless forces, big and small, were preparing to rush to the imperial capital to celebrate the new emperor’s ascension to the throne.</p><p>This was because everyone knew very well that Lu Ming was behind Hua Chi.</p><p>A King tier who wasn’t even twenty years old was the main point.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming was not dead, Hua Chi’s authority would be impregnable.</p><p>The entire blazing sun Empire was anticipating the arrival of the next month. Even the other thirty-five empires were paying attention to this matter.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about any of that. He brought Lu Yuntian and Li Ping back to fiery wind city and the Lu family.</p><p>Red lights were hung all over the Lu family’s residence, and it was a jubilant scene.</p><p>Countless people were going in and out, and it was extremely lively.</p><p>The Lu family was now a first-class family, such as a noble family. In the past few days, anyone with some power in the hundreds of cities had come to congratulate them.</p><p>“The young master is back, and so are the master and Madam!”</p><p>His loud roar caused the entire Lu family to boil.</p><p>“Master, Madam, the young master is back!”</p><p>The news instantly spread throughout the Lu family.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the Lu family’s main gate, they were dumbfounded to discover that countless people had swarmed out.</p><p>At the very front were the few remaining core elders of the Lu family and the branch Masters of a few branches.</p><p>Behind them, there were at least a few hundred people whom Lu Ming did not know.</p><p>greetings, family head, Madam, young master. I haven’t seen you for many years. I can die without any regrets.</p><p>A core elder bowed in greeting. He looked at Lu Yuntian and nearly shed tears.</p><p>“Everyone, please rise!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian’s eyes were filled with complicated emotions.</p><p>After so many years, he had finally returned to the Lu family.</p><p>I am the city Lord of flowing Light City. Greetings to the champion King, the Lu family’s head, and Madam Lu.</p><p>A burly man with a stout face squeezed out of the crowd and knelt down before Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m the head of the Liu family in Wutong city. Greetings, champion King!</p><p>“Patriarch Lu, do you still recognize me? I’m Lucio, the city Lord of fragrance city!”</p><p>……</p><p>Behind him, a group of people came over to greet him.</p><p>“Alright, everyone, let us in first!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and shouted.</p><p>His words seemed to contain endless majesty. Everyone quieted down and made way for Lu Ming and the rest to enter.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
