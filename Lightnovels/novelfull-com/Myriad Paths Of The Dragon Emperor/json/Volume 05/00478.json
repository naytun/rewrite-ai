They were so dense that they blotted out the sky and covered the earth. Their momentum was so strong that many mystical sword sect disciples broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>The ten directions sword sect had used these two elite armies to break through and unexpectedly arrive in front of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When Lin Xueyi and the others came out, a figure rushed out from the Army of the ten direction sword sect. He stood in the air with an imposing aura.</p><p>It was Qiu Wuyang, the head of the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, you’re already at your wit’s end. Hurry up and surrender. If you surrender, I might spare your life!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang stood with his hands behind his back, looking at Lin Xueyi with disdain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lin Xueyi took a step forward and floated in the air, facing Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>“Qiu Wuyang, you just borrowed some external power. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi coldly said.</p><p>haha, Lin Xueyi, you’re really naïve. The winner takes all. You still don’t understand this logic. You’re really a blockhead. No wonder you failed!</p><p>Qiu Wuyang laughed proudly.</p><p>Lin Xueyi did not look at him, but looked at the sun Legion. She cupped her fists and said, ” everyone from the great sun mansion, the mystical sword sect has never offended the great sun mansion. Why did you send an Army to attack us? ”</p><p>“Haha, you didn’t offend our great sun mansion? What a joke!”</p><p>Three figures flew out from the sun Legion. Each of them was wearing golden armor and had an extremely strong aura.</p><p>All three of them were half-step King Warriors.</p><p>The one in the middle was a burly man who was more than two meters tall. He was extremely burly, and he was the one who had just spoken.</p><p>&Nbsp; he coldly looked at Lin Xueyi and said, ” your mystical sword sect has a long history with my great sun mansion. You just don’t know about it.</p><p>The old grudge he was referring to was the matter between Lu Ming and yang Liuji. Naturally, Lin Xueyi did not know about it. She was stunned.</p><p>Hmph! the burly man sneered and continued, ” moreover, even if there’s no old grudge between you two, you two should be annihilated as well. Who asked you to offend the geniuses of the Ditian divine guards? ”</p><p>“The Ditian divine guards! It’s really the Ditian divine guards! Qiu changkong, is it you?”</p><p>At this moment, Ling potian flew up to the sky and stood beside Lin Xueyi, shouting.</p><p>“Haha, that’s me!”</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew out from the Army of the omnidirectional sword sect. It was Qiu changkong.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes turned cold as he laughed. Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, the blazing sun Empire should be unified. You guys are so stubborn, you’re just asking for your own destruction!</p><p>Qiu changkong, as an empyrean heaven Divine Guard, you actually used your personal power to mobilize the armies of other empires and start a war. You’ve violated the rules of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. If this matter is investigated, you won’t be able to escape punishment!</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>“Investigate? Haha, what a joke, just you guys? ‘Even if you report me to the Empyrean heavens divine Palace, who will listen to you? who will pursue me, a genius Empyrean heavens Divine Guard who is at the peak of his power, just because of an ant from a small Empire like you? It’s ridiculous.”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed loudly, showing no fear.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the others all gritted their teeth in anger.</p><p>But in his heart, he felt helpless.</p><p>They knew that Qiu changkong was right. They were just half-step King Warriors of a few small empires. In the eyes of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they were nothing. Even if they reported them, no one would pay them any attention.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, don’t be so arrogant. Lu Ming is one of the eastern sky divine guards. If he finds out about this, he won’t let this matter rest.”</p><p>On the mountain peak of the mystical sword sect, Hua Chi shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hehe. I advise you not to have high hopes for Lu Ming. He’s probably already gone to see the King of Hell.”</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly laughed.</p><p>“Impossible? Qiu changkong, you’re f * cking bullshitting! How could Lu Ming be in trouble? you’re not dead, how could Lu Ming be?”</p><p>Hua Chi shouted.</p><p>“Hua Chi!”</p><p>kill! Qiu changkong roared as a cold killing intent exploded from his body. His aura was like a mountain, terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>“Half-step King, you … You’ve actually reached the half-step King realm?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi shouted in disbelief.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu changkong’s aura was indeed that of a half-step King.</p><p>It seemed that Qiu changkong’s cultivation had also improved greatly during this period of time. He had reached the peak of martial ancestor realm level nine, and he had also comprehended a trace of Thunder intent. He was indeed a half-step King.</p><p>Ling potian, Hua Chi, Shangguan Ming, Yan Quan, and the others all had ugly expressions.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s cultivation had already reached the half-step King realm in such a short period of time. This was truly terrifying.</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed coldly and smugly. He looked at Lin Xueyi and the others as if he was looking down on ants. Finally, he turned to Hua Chi and coldly shouted, ” “Hua Chi, How dare you? I’m a Ditian Divine Guard, and you, a Prince of a fallen nation, dare to scold me? you’re simply courting death. I’ll give you a chance now. Kneel down and kowtow to me in public to admit your mistakes. I can consider sparing your dog life.”</p><p>a man can be killed, but not humiliated. Qiu changkong, if you have the ability, kill me. It’s impossible for me to kneel down and admit my mistakes!</p><p>Hua Chi shouted coldly, not giving Qiu changkong any face at all.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes turned cold. His palm was like a sword as he slashed out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A sword of lightning streaked across the air and slashed at Hua Chi.</p><p>Fast, so fast that it was impossible to describe. Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the others wanted to save him, but it was already too late.</p><p>“Eighth prince, be careful!”</p><p>An old figure suddenly rushed out from Hua Chi’s side. A vast aura rose from his body as he slashed out a blade light.</p><p>However, the saber-light was shattered like tofu by Qiu changkong’s sword-light.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood gushed out as the old figure was cut in half by Qiu changkong’s sword.</p><p>“Royal grandfather!”</p><p>Hua Chi let out an earth-shaking roar.</p><p>The person who had stood in front of Hua Chi was the last Imperial uncle of the royal family. The last 9th level martial ancestor realm expert had died just like that.</p><p>The old Imperial uncle had been standing by Hua Chi’s side the entire time, so he had been able to save Hua Chi’s life in time.</p><p>“Ah, Qiu changkong, I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Qiu changkong.</p><p>“You, an ant-like thing, want to fight me to the death? die!”</p><p>Qiu Chang Kong coldly snorted as another sword light slashed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, Lin Xueyi was prepared. The aura on her body surged, and a sword light burst out, slashing toward Qiu changkong’s sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a shocking boom, and then a figure retreated.</p><p>It was Lin Xueyi. At this moment, his body was trembling. Everyone could see a deep wound on Lin Xueyi’s chest, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>Everyone looked at Qiu changkong in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
