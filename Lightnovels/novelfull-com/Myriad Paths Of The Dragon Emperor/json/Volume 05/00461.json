How could he be compared to her?</p><p>Back then, he said that the gap between him and Lu Ming would grow wider and wider. He was right. It was just that Lu Ming was far ahead of him.</p><p>Everyone looked at Sheng Wushuang and shook their heads.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was just born at the wrong time.</p><p>It was not that he was not strong, but Lu Ming was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Sheng Wushuang indifferently and then turned away. He moved and appeared in front of Xue Chao.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? Xue Chao has already been defeated, do you dare to make another move?”</p><p>In the sky, Thunder Palace Master shouted coldly, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Who said I’m going to continue? I just want to get the prize for my win!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then with a flick of his finger, a stream of quintessential essence entered Xue Chao’s body. Xue Chao cried out and woke up. When he saw Lu Ming in front of him, he screamed in fear,”Lu Ming, you … You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He pursed his lips and said, ” Xue Chao, you’ve lost. Hand over 80000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals. Hurry up.</p><p>“Eight … Wan, I … I …”</p><p>At this moment, he even wanted to die.</p><p>Previously, he had the same thoughts as Sheng Wushuang. He had agreed to bet 80000 Supreme spiritual crystals because he thought that he would definitely win.</p><p>He had never expected that he would actually lose.</p><p>80,000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals! Xue Chao had never had so many Supreme spiritual crystals in his entire life. This was what his master had lent him, so he definitely had to return it.</p><p>His heart trembled, and he cast a pleading look at Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s eyes flickered a few times and he turned his head.</p><p>At the scene, there were five Palace Masters, not just him. If he was alone, it would be easy to handle.</p><p>However, with so many Palace Masters present, he did not dare to overstep his boundaries.</p><p>Xue Chao, if you agree to a bet, you must accept your loss. Seeing that your master is useless, just give me the spirit crystals!</p><p>The wind Palace master’s indifferent voice sounded.</p><p>Xue Chao’s body started to shiver. His face was deathly pale as he took out a storage ring. It was the one that the Thunder Palace Master had given him.</p><p>Lu Ming received it with a smile. He scanned it with his mind and after confirming that there was no mistake, he kept it.</p><p>“Thanks, I’ve been lacking crystals recently!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and added. He was overjoyed.</p><p>It had only been a short while, but he had already obtained 110000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals. It was so easy to earn these spiritual crystals. It was even faster than robbery.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had enough spirit crystals to temper his essential core.</p><p>And Xue Chao was so angry that he almost fainted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you willing to be my disciple? I won’t ask you to only practice one kind of mentality. You can practice as many as you want, and I’ll only be responsible for teaching you the wind mentality. How about it?”</p><p>The wind Palace Master suddenly spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect the wind Palace Master to suddenly ask him to be his disciple here.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’m willing to take you in as my disciple. Are you willing to be my disciple? my conditions are the same as old man Feng’S. I won’t restrict you from cultivating any other intent. I’ll only teach you the intent of fire!</p><p>At this moment, the palace Master of fire also spoke.</p><p>The others were shocked. They all looked at Lu Ming in a daze, their faces filled with envy.</p><p>The wind Palace Master and the fire Palace Master had actually spoken at the same time, wanting to take Lu Ming as their disciple. Furthermore, they would not interfere with his cultivation of other intents. In other words, Lu Ming could have a few people as his Masters at the same time.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming would be able to acknowledge the Wind and Fire Palace Masters as his Masters at the same time. How could they not be envious?</p><p>It was extremely difficult for Ordinary Geniuses to acknowledge a Hall Master as their master. However, there were actually a few Hall Masters who wanted to take Lu Ming as their disciple.</p><p>However, on second thought, it was normal. The talent that Lu Ming had displayed was too shocking. His future was limitless. If they could take him in as their disciple, their line would definitely flourish in the future.</p><p>Besides, the palace master of gold and the palace Master of earth were also very tempted. Unfortunately, the concepts that they cultivated were not in line with Lu Ming’s. Naturally, they could not take Lu Ming as their disciple.</p><p>They could only look at the Wind and Fire Palace Masters with envy.</p><p>look, even Lu Ming is stunned. He must be so happy that he is stunned, right? ”</p><p>Some people said sourly.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was not in a daze. He was thinking and hesitating.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming was hesitating.</p><p>The benefits of being able to acknowledge the two Hall Masters as his Masters were self-evident.</p><p>Not only did he have two more powerful backers, but if he could get guidance from the two Hall Masters on the Wind and Fire concepts, he would definitely be able to avoid many detours. Lu Ming was very tempted by these two points.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had some concerns.</p><p>Lu Ming had too many secrets.</p><p>Not only did he cultivate God-level cultivation techniques, but he also had God-level martial techniques, the bloodline of the nine Dragons, and even the Supreme shrine.</p><p>There were some secrets that couldn’t be seen through, but if he were to acknowledge them as his master and spend time with them, it was hard to guarantee that the hall Masters wouldn’t notice if they were too close.</p><p>At that time, these secrets would be exposed, and he would be in danger.</p><p>As long as he exposed even one of them, it was hard to guarantee that the hall Masters would not have evil intentions and kill him to take his treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming had to consider this.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Lu Ming gritted his teeth and made a decision.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed to the wind Fire Palace Master. “Thank you, Hall Masters, for your kindness. However, I once had a master and I swore that I would never take anyone else as my master. I’m sorry to disappoint you.”</p><p>Lu Ming made up a reason at the last minute.</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked and clamored.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming actually rejected it. He actually rejected it?”</p><p>“Nest, I didn’t hear wrong, did I? the two Hall Masters want to take him as a disciple at the same time and don’t interfere with his other intent realms. ‘This …’ Isn’t this too infuriating?”</p><p>heavens, he doesn’t want this opportunity. Give it to me, just give me half of it.</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>However, no one said that Lu Ming was arrogant now.</p><p>If it had been before today, if Lu Ming had rejected the two Hall Masters ‘kind intentions, there would definitely be a bunch of people who would stand up to scold him, saying that he was overestimating his own ability, arrogant, and did not respect the hall Masters.</p><p>But now, even if there were people who thought so, they did not dare to come out and criticize him. They were afraid that after a period of time, Lu Ming’s cultivation would improve greatly and their faces would be smacked swollen.</p><p>The Wind and Fire Palace Masters were stunned. They did not expect Lu Ming to reject them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why don’t you reconsider?”</p><p>The palace Master of wind said.</p><p>I am very grateful for Palace Master Feng’s favor. However, I have made an oath and I can not go against it. Otherwise, I will become an ungrateful person who disrespects my master.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists again.</p><p>Seeing this, the wind Palace Master knew that Lu Ming had made up his mind and sighed.</p><p>It would be a pity to miss out on such a good material.</p><p>Beside him, Thunder Palace master’s eyes flashed with joy.</p><p>“Good, good. Lu Ming, if you’ve acknowledged old freak Feng and old freak Huo as your Masters, then things would be difficult. But now, you’ve actually rejected them. Haha, you’re the one who’s looking for death.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed in his heart, but his eyes were extremely sinister.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
