This place was really strange. The deeper he went, the richer and more violent the fire spiritual energy would be.</p><p>...</p><p>What was down there? How could such a strange area be formed?</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He continued down and came to the 13th level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The surging fire spiritual energy hit him in the face. Lu Ming felt as if he had walked into a volcano, and the scorching aura filled his body.</p><p>“This fire spiritual Qi is too abnormal!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the concept of fire to block the fire spiritual Qi outside. He then looked around.</p><p>The 13th floor was very small, only the size of an ordinary secret room. The surrounding walls had already turned into fiery red colored glass.</p><p>The stone room was empty. Lu Ming could feel that the violent fire spiritual energy was coming from under his feet.</p><p>it seems that the martial King of the royal family could only dig up to here. He didn’t have the strength to go any further. It’s true. The fire spiritual Qi here is unbearable for ordinary King level cultivators!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>However, although he was only at the early stage of the LV 1 martial King realm, he was no ordinary King. He was so powerful that he could kill a Lv 3 martial King.</p><p>With three intent realms protecting him and his true essence exploding, the fire spiritual Qi here couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>“Then I’ll continue digging and see what’s down there.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and a fifth-level spiritual weapon, a broadsword, appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming slashed the broadsword at the ground.</p><p>There were three types of intent realms on the saber.</p><p>Clang clang clang</p><p>When the broadsword hit the ground, it was as if it had hit an iron block. Sparks flew everywhere, but the ground was still cut into pieces of glazed stones.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and kept the stone away. Then, he continued to chop.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had created a big hole that continued downward.</p><p>After about ten meters, Lu Ming began to expand in all directions.</p><p>Two hours later, a stone chamber appeared.</p><p>The 14th floor.</p><p>Here, the fire spiritual Qi had reached a terrifying level, but he still couldn’t see what was emitting it.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>This was because he had already reached his limit. If he continued to go down, he was afraid that he would not be able to withstand it with his strength.</p><p>This was too terrifying.</p><p>this is amazing. No matter what’s down there, I’m afraid it’s very amazing. Forget it, I’m not strong enough now. When I have the strength in the future, I’ll definitely dig all the way down and see what’s down there.</p><p>Lu Ming decided in his heart.</p><p>there’s still a dozen days before Hua Chi’s Ascension. I can cultivate here!</p><p>The fire spiritual Qi here was extremely rich, and it contained a powerful fire concept. It was a good place to cultivate and comprehend the fire concept, which was definitely many times stronger than the outside world.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat down cross-legged, and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. He opened his mouth, and billowing fire spiritual Qi gathered in the dragon’s mouth.</p><p>The violent fire spiritual Qi was refined by the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and directly transformed into vital essence.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming extended his consciousness and began to comprehend the concept of fire.</p><p>As expected, it was much faster to comprehend the fire concept here than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the concept of fire slowly deepened.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed. There were only two days left before Hua Chi’s Ascension. Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation and walked out of the earth Aeon cave.</p><p>“Look, Lu Ming is out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked out of the earth cave, he heard a shrill scream. Then, he saw a large group of girls looking at him with shining eyes.</p><p>“Is that the champion Wang Lu Ming? He’s so handsome!”</p><p>it’s over, it’s over. I’m already tempted. What should I do? ”</p><p>“I want to marry him!”</p><p>There were at least a few hundred girls staring at him with bright eyes.</p><p>“No way? I’ve been cultivating for more than ten days, why is there still someone waiting here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He moved and left the place.</p><p>Leaving behind a group of sighing girls.</p><p>The imperial capital was getting more and more lively. All the tens of thousands of cities in the blazing sun Empire had sent envoys to congratulate them. Not only that, but even the other empires had sent envoys.</p><p>The imperial capital was filled with a jubilant atmosphere.</p><p>In the Imperial garden of the Imperial Palace, three figures sat facing each other in a Pavilion.</p><p>“Come, big rock, the three of us haven’t had a drink together in a long time. Come, accompany me and three big bowls!”</p><p>Hua Chi lifted a large bowl of wine and said to a tall youth.</p><p>The three of them were Lu Ming, Hua Chi, and pang Shi.</p><p>A few days ago, pang Shi had followed the mystical sword sect’s group to the imperial capital.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came out of seclusion, Hua Chi dragged Lu Ming and pang Shi out for a drink.</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He and pang Shi had not seen each other for a long time. The scene of the three of them often drinking in the dormitory was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll drink with you!”</p><p>Pang Shi picked up the big bowl and finished it in one gulp. He then scratched his head and laughed foolishly. out of the three of us, one of us is about to become the Emperor, and the other is a world-famous King. I’m the weakest of us all. I’m only a ninth grade master realm cultivator!</p><p>big rock, don’t be discouraged. You’re a steady person with a strong foundation. Your future achievements are limitless. In the future, I might have to give up my position as the defender-general of the state to you!</p><p>Lu Ming patted pang Shi’s shoulder.</p><p>“Haha, senior brother Lu Ming, I’m not discouraged. I’m just happy for the two of you. When I return to the village in the future, I’ll say that I know the two of you. I wonder how many people will be envious?”</p><p>Pang Shi smiled honestly.</p><p>“En, that’s right!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and some books and Jade bottles appeared on the table.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the three books and passed them to pang Shi. “Big rock, there are three cultivation technique manuals here, all of them are low-rank earth grade. They are very suitable for you to cultivate, take them!”</p><p>“What? An earth grade secret art? Senior brother Lu Ming, this is too precious. I can’t take it!”</p><p>Pang Shi waved his hands.</p><p>big rock, just take it. To be honest, I have no use for these cultivation techniques and secret manuals. It’s a waste. You should take them and cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, pang Shi accepted the gift. He was extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>In the blazing sun Empire, a low Earth grade cultivation method or martial skill was definitely one of the best.</p><p>“Hua Chi, these books are for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming passed the other books to Hua Chi.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Hua Chi did not stand on ceremony and accepted it.</p><p>He knew that given Lu Ming’s cultivation level, he would not be able to use these cultivation methods and martial arts techniques.</p><p>also, these pills can help you break through the shackles and improve your cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the pills and said to the two of them.</p><p>He then split the pills into two portions and handed them over to Hua Chi and pang Shi.</p><p>Many of these pills were obtained from the martial King’s storage ring, and they were definitely of high quality.</p><p>After the two of them put it away, they were extremely excited.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
