I have some crystal morning cream here. Although it can’t cure your father’s Meridian injury, it should be enough to treat this scar.</p><p>...</p><p>The one who spoke was a white-haired old man. He was the Grand Emperor of the cloud desolate Empire and was at the middle stage of the martial King realm. He was known as one of the three strongest people in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun.</p><p>He took out a Jade bottle and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic and took it without any hesitation.</p><p>Although he could not heal Lu Yuntian’s meridians, Lu Ming was overjoyed that he could heal the scar on his face.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping also bowed to the cloud desolate Empire’s Grand Imperial sire.</p><p>“Haha, no need to be so polite. This is just a small token of my appreciation.”</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire’s Grand Emperor laughed.</p><p>Then, everyone took their seats.</p><p>At this moment, almost everyone who should be here had arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming raised his head and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. He said in a cold voice, ” “Your Excellency, you’ve been watching there for so long, shouldn’t you show yourself?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words shocked the others, and they all looked up at the sky.</p><p>However, the sky was very clear. There wasn’t a single cloud in sight, so where was the person?</p><p>Without clouds, how could one hide? Could Lu Ming have sensed wrongly?</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>hehe, as expected of the champion King. To become a King at such a young age, you’re indeed extraordinary. You can actually sense me.</p><p>A sneer came from the sky. At the same time, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>It was as if he had appeared out of thin air.</p><p>It was an old man in a black robe with white hair and a cold face.</p><p>“It’s you, the netherworld old ghost of the Hades Palace.”</p><p>The moment the cloud desolate Empire’s Grand Emperor saw this old man, he shouted.</p><p>On the battlefield, the king tier also turned pale with fright.</p><p>Could this elder be the strongest assassin of the Hades Palace, one of the three strongest experts in the 36 countries of the cloud wilderness, netherworld, who was as famous as the cloud wilderness Empire’s retired emperor?</p><p>This was a name that would make people’s faces change.</p><p>The Hades Palace was the number one assassin organization in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. It had branches in every Empire.</p><p>The blazing sun Empire also had a branch of the Hades Palace, which was also known as one of the four major assassin organizations of the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>It could be said that the underworld Royal Palace was the enemy of all the people in the 36 kingdoms of Emperor Yun. Almost every powerful force had someone assassinated by the underworld Royal Palace.</p><p>At this moment, netherworld’s appearance made many people’s faces change.</p><p>“You’ve been hiding in the sky and acting sneaky. Do you think I don’t know? If you’re here to congratulate me, I’ll welcome you. If not, then get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he stared at the netherworld.</p><p>hehe, champion King, you’re indeed young and impetuous. What a big tone!</p><p>You Ming sneered and continued, ” Lu Ming, you’re the one who shouldn’t have appeared. Once you appear, the balance of the 36 kingdoms of Emperor Yun will be broken sooner or later. Therefore, it’s best that you disappear from this world.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>hehe, it’s said that some time ago, you killed an early Lv 3 martial King realm warrior. I can only say that rumors are really powerful, and those who spread these rumors are brainless people who don’t understand the secrets of the martial King realm at all. In the martial King realm, it’s impossible for a warrior who has just broken through to the martial King realm to cross two levels and kill a Lv 3 martial King realm warrior.</p><p>so many people. How stupid. They actually believed such words? ”</p><p>Netherworld sneered, and his eyes revealed killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s rise made the Hades Palace feel threatened.</p><p>Now, the underworld Royal Mansion could get whatever they wanted in the 36 countries of Emperor Yun. Many forces were in awe of them.</p><p>He was already used to such a life. However, Lu Ming, a young king, had appeared. His future achievements would definitely surpass his. When that time came, the Hades Palace would not have a good life.</p><p>Therefore, he decided to kill Lu Ming completely before he grew up.</p><p>“Then you can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’ll try, hehe, I’ll try!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a sword light suddenly shot out from netherworld’s hand.</p><p>The sword gleam was extremely sharp and unbelievably fast. It was soundless as it stabbed towards Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast. He had crossed thousands of meters in the void.</p><p>He was fast, but Lu Ming was faster.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear had appeared in Lu Ming’s hands at some point in time. He thrust the spear and it hit the sword light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a crisp sound, the sword light was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword light flew back to netherworld’s hand.</p><p>“You have some skills!”</p><p>Netherworld said faintly.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming soared into the sky and flew high into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense. He took a step forward.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps had unleashed all three intents at the same time.</p><p>An incomparably terrifying energy burst forth, blasting towards netherworld.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out as a sword light shot out from netherworld’s hand. It was even more powerful than before.</p><p>However, the sword gleam crumbled under Lu Ming’s feet. Under the powerful force, netherworld was forced to retreat five to six steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming took his second step.</p><p>A power that was several times stronger than before suddenly erupted.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Netherworld’s expression changed for the first time, and it became extremely solemn.</p><p>His body flashed with silver light as he burst out with the power of his bloodline. At the same time, he stabbed out with his sword. Ghosts wailed and wolves howled in the world. A black sword light stabbed forward. In the process of the sword light, countless ghostly shadows flashed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom erupted between heaven and earth, and the entire imperial capital began to shake.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the next moment, netherworld spat out a large mouthful of blood. His figure retreated rapidly, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He was too powerful. Lu Ming was too powerful. He was even more powerful than the rumors had said.</p><p>He now believed that Lu Ming had really killed an early-stage third level martial King realm expert.</p><p>But it was too late to believe it now.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming had already taken his third step.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven treading steps, three steps in a row, the power continued to stack.</p><p>The power of this step was like a vast ocean, boundless and endless, submerging the netherworld.</p><p>“No! No!”</p><p>Netherworld howled madly. He exerted all his strength in an attempt to break out of the range of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. As the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps landed, netherworld’s body cracked at a speed that was visible to the naked eye. Then, he exploded in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline to devour netherworld’s blood essence. At the same time, he took off his storage ring. Then, with a wave of his hand, a flame appeared and burned netherworld’s corpse to ashes.</p><p>Below, countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Especially the Kings, they couldn’t stop gasping. They felt cold all over, and their backs were wet with cold sweat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The netherworld, whose name had shaken the Emperor Yun’s 36 nations for hundreds of years, had caused countless people to turn pale at the mention of it. How could it be killed by Lu Ming so easily?</p><p>If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
