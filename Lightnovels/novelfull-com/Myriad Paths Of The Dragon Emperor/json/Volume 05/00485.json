The heavens have eyes.</p><p>Lu Yuntian burst out laughing.</p><p>Uncle Lu, Uncle Lu, it was my fault in the past. I was blind and blinded by greed. I was wrong. Please, on account of my young and ignorant age, spare my dog life!</p><p>Qiu changkong wailed in anguish, tears and snot streaming down his face.</p><p>Lu Ming was quite impressed with this. Tears and snot were flowing out of her eyes and nose.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, shut up. You’re a disgrace to the Qiu family.”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang shouted.</p><p>“Old man, you shut up. What’s the Qiu family? how much is it worth? don’t mention the Qiu family to me.”</p><p>Qiu changkong shouted.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang was so angry that he almost vomited blood. His chest heaved up and down, and his eyes were filled with disappointment.</p><p>Was this still the genius of his Qiu family that only appeared once in a thousand years? It was simply embarrassing.</p><p>“Old man!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Qiu changkong’s eyes narrowed as he struggled to his feet. He took out a dagger and walked toward Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>The eyes of Lu Ming, Lin Xueyi, and the rest flashed, but they did not make a move.</p><p>“Evil creature, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang roared.</p><p>“What are you doing? It’s all your fault, go to hell!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes were filled with ruthlessness as he stabbed the dagger in his hand toward Qiu Wuyang.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang roared and rolled to the side, dodging the attack, but Qiu changkong immediately followed up with another attack.</p><p>This time, Qiu Wuyang couldn’t avoid it anymore. The dagger pierced through his back and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Evil creature, evil creature!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang roared. His eyes were filled with despair, unwillingness, and disbelief.</p><p>He could not believe that Qiu changkong would kill him.</p><p>In the end, he let out an unwilling roar and died.</p><p>On the side, Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the others had complicated expressions.</p><p>Qiu Wuyang, the Overlord of the blazing sun Empire, a half-step King of his generation, and a formidable character who had almost unified the entire blazing sun Empire, had been killed by his most valued junior. It was truly a miserable scene.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Uncle Lu, look, I’m truly remorseful. I’ve even killed Qiu Wuyang. I beg you, please let me go!”</p><p>Qiu changkong knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.</p><p>“If I let such a person go, even the heavens would not agree.” Lu Yuntian’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his fingers and four long Spears were condensed from his essential core. They flew out and nailed Qiu changkong’s limbs to the ground.</p><p>Qiu changkong let out a shrill cry.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and a combat sword appeared. He said,”Father, Qiu changkong’s life is in our hands now!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian had once been captured by Qiu changkong and tortured for eight years. In this world, the person who should kill Qiu changkong the most was Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also knew that Lu Yuntian had always had this knot in his heart.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian took the sword and walked toward Qiu changkong.</p><p>“No, Uncle Lu, don’t kill me!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was still begging for mercy.</p><p>shut up, Uncle Lu. You’re not fit to call me that! Die!</p><p>die! Lu Yuntian shouted coldly and slashed out with his sword. Qiu Wuyang’s head flew high into the air.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>After killing Qiu changkong, Lu Yuntian seemed to have been relieved of a heavy burden and heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, thank you for letting me kill Qiu changkong!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said to Lu Ming.</p><p>father, you and I are father and son. There is no need to thank me. This is what I should do. Unfortunately, I still couldn’t find a treasure that can help you recover.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>“Haha, Ming ‘er, there’s no need to force it. I’m already very satisfied with your current achievements.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian laughed.</p><p>“Eh? Father, mother, why don’t I see Qiu Yue?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming did not see Qiu Yue from the beginning. It was very strange.</p><p>It was impossible for Qiu Yue to leave Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s side after such a huge battle.</p><p>At the mention of Qiu Yue, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed the change in their expressions. He could not help but feel his heart skip a beat.</p><p>Did something happen to Qiu Yue?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but feel anxious.</p><p>“Father, mother, Qiuyue, what happened to her?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, don’t worry. Qiuyue is fine!”</p><p>Li Ping said hurriedly.</p><p>“Then why don’t I see her?”</p><p>“Sigh, it’s a long story. Ming ‘er, let’s go back to our residence first and talk about it in detail!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian sighed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and returned to the courtyard where Lu Yuntian and Li Ping were staying.</p><p>As for the matters outside, he would leave it to Lin Xueyi and the others to handle.</p><p>After returning to the courtyard, Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping sat down on the stone bench in the courtyard.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, Qiu Yue left three months ago.”</p><p>Li Ping sighed. There was a hint of reluctance in her eyes.</p><p>“He left? Where did she go?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, it’s like this. About three months ago, a middle-aged woman suddenly appeared. She said that she saw Qiu Yue’s talent and that Qiu Yue’s bloodline was suitable for her to inherit her legacy. She wanted to take Qiu Yue as her disciple and take her away from this place.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian explained.</p><p>“Ah? There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>that’s right. According to that middle-aged woman, she was traveling the world to find a suitable successor. She found Qiu Yue based on the resonance of her bloodline and was determined to take Qiu Yue as her disciple. At first, Qiu Yue and I were against it, but later on, that middle-aged woman revealed a shocking method.</p><p>“With a wave of her hand, the day suddenly turned into night. The most amazing thing is that she can tear the space apart. It’s simply a divine technique. Seeing the opponent’s incredible technique, I’ve decided to let Qiu Yue go with her. After all, it’s good for Qiu Yue.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>“What? With a wave of his hand, he can turn day into night, and he can even tear through space?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked. What kind of technique was this? it was too terrifying.</p><p>that’s right. However, that girl Qiuyue only wanted to wait for you to return and was unwilling to acknowledge you as her master. In the end, she was forcefully taken away by that middle-aged woman.</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>“Forcefully taken away?”</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>“That’s right, but Ming ‘er, you don’t have to worry. I think that woman really wants to take Qiu Yue as her disciple. She shouldn’t make things difficult for Qiu Yue.”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>Although he said this, Lu Ming still felt very uncomfortable.</p><p>Could it be that he would never be able to see Qiu Yue again?</p><p>“Father, mother, did the other party leave any news? Did he say which sect he’s from?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the other party only left behind one sentence, and that was ‘in the divine wilderness, there is only one in the world.’</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>“The only one in the world in the divine wilderness? What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and he fell into deep thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
