He was at the bottom of the group and was often ridiculed.</p><p>However, the cloud Emperor mountain range was on the weaker side, and no one had become an Emperor sky Divine Guard in the previous tournament. This made him less and less valued.</p><p>He had once dreamed that the cloud Emperor mountain range would produce a few peerless geniuses whose names would shake the world and make him proud.</p><p>However, he knew that it was just a dream. It was impossible.</p><p>But now, all of this had come true. How could he not be excited?</p><p>Those people who had looked down on him in the past had all come to make friends with him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Qiu changkong, it’s all thanks to the two of you!”</p><p>Lu Xiu sighed as he looked at the two young men on the fighting ring with bright eyes.</p><p>He was especially shocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu changkong. He vaguely knew that Qiu changkong had a powerful backer in the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>It was still acceptable for him to achieve such results. However, Lu Ming was completely alone. He did not have any backing. He had relied on his own hard work to reach this stage. This made him value him even more.</p><p>Everyone was discussing, but most of the discussions were about Lu Ming and Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Cloud Emperor mountain range?”</p><p>On the fighting ring, the other geniuses and experts looked at Lu Ming and Qiu changkong with surprise in their eyes.</p><p>The corners of Qiu changkong’s mouth curled up, and he didn’t even try to hide the smugness on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming only smiled and stood quietly at the side.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector opened his mouth and the entire place suddenly became silent.</p><p>now, I will announce the rules of the duel. The rules are very simple. We will draw lots and fight one on one. The winner will advance and the loser will be eliminated. This will continue until the strongest one is decided.</p><p>in the process of the battle, you can’t consume any pills or use any Battle Beasts. You can do whatever you want, but there is one principle, and that is you can’t kill your opponent!</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>“Can’t kill the opponent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt that it was a pity.</p><p>If he had met Qiu changkong, he would have been able to escape with his life.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you’re lucky!”</p><p>At the side, Buried Life chuckled.</p><p>“You’re the lucky one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because I can’t kill you. I can still cripple you!”</p><p>Zang Sheng’s cold voice rang out.</p><p>“Is that so?” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>On the other side, Qiu changkong sneered.</p><p>OK, now, I have carved sixteen numbers on these seventeen Jade plates. They are number one to number sixteen. The last one is empty.</p><p>all of you will draw lots. The one who draws number one will fight against number sixteen, number two will fight against number fifteen, number three will fight against number fourteen, and so on. The one who draws an empty number will directly advance to the next round.</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>With that, he waved his hand and 17 Jade plates floated in the air. They emitted a hazy light and covered the numbers on them.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Zang Sheng laughed coldly and reached out his hand. A powerful suction force was produced and the Jade token was caught in his hand.</p><p>Then, the others followed suit and grabbed a Jade plate.</p><p>Lu Ming also grabbed a Jade card.</p><p>Grabbing the Jade token in his hand, he infused his zhenqi into it, and a number appeared on the Jade token.</p><p>No, it was not a number, but two words: Empty.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect his luck to be so good. In the first round, he actually drew an empty draw.</p><p>“Alright, report the number you drew!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector said.</p><p>“I’m number 16!”</p><p>Zang Sheng was the first to walk out. He flipped open the Jade token and there was a number on it: 16.</p><p>“I’ll be number three!”</p><p>Qiu changkong walked out and opened his Jade token as well. The number on the token was three.</p><p>“I’m number five!”</p><p>“Number 6!”</p><p>One by one, the young men flipped open their Jade tokens.</p><p>Soon, he had opened all the pages from Room 1 to Room 16.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming.</p><p>If there were people from the first to the sixteenth, then wouldn’t the rest be a bye?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flipped the Jade tablet. The words ‘bye’ were written on it.</p><p>it’s a bye as expected. This kid’s luck is really good!</p><p>his luck is not bad, but it’s useless. In the end, it still depends on strength. If he doesn’t have strength, he will be very miserable when he meets an expert in the next round!</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>On the grandstand, the crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>“Brat, you’re lucky!”</p><p>Zang Sheng cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming could not even be bothered to look at him. He directly ignored him.</p><p>This was a Mad Dog. There was no point in saying more. When the time came, he would beat him up so badly that even his mother wouldn’t be able to recognize him.</p><p>now, the battle begins. Number one against number sixteen. The rest of you, step aside.</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest retreated to the side, leaving only zang Sheng and a young man in a brocade robe at the scene.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s face revealed a sinister smile as he stared at the youth in embroidered robes and said, ” “Kid, I advise you to admit defeat quickly. Otherwise, you’ll suffer later!”</p><p>hehe, admit defeat. In my dictionary, there is no such thing as admitting defeat. I’ve long been displeased by your arrogance. I hope that your strength will not disappoint me!</p><p>The youth in the brocade robe laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“You’ll regret this very soon!”</p><p>Zang Sheng sneered.</p><p>The atmosphere was already tense even before they started fighting.</p><p>In the stands, the crowd was also in a heated discussion, expressing their own opinions.</p><p>that’s Yu changfei, the strongest genius of the Yuxu plain in the Super region. Who do you think will win? ”</p><p>I think it’s the burial in the Dragon burial pool. This person is the first to pass the test and appear here!</p><p>in my opinion, that might not be the case. Being the first to clear the stage might not necessarily mean that one’s combat strength is the strongest!</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Everyone was just discussing when two powerful auras erupted.</p><p>Then, the two figures charged at each other like lightning.</p><p>“Jade-cutting palm!”</p><p>“Blood Dragon Claw!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, a terrifying blast of air swept out. Blood-red and jade-green light exploded and filled the entire fighting ring.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, a scream was heard. A figure was sent flying like a cannonball, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood in the air.</p><p>It was Yu changfei, the young man from Yuxu plain.</p><p>Countless people widened their eyes.</p><p>Yu changfei, the strongest genius in the Super region, was sent flying by one move and spat out blood.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>From the aura that Yu changfei had just released, he was definitely at the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm. Furthermore, he had been through four battles.</p><p>Such an expert was actually sent flying by a single move from zang Sheng. How terrifying was zang Sheng?</p><p>haha, I was wondering how strong you would be. Turns out you’re just trash. Now, I’ll let you know how strong I am.</p><p>Zang Sheng laughed coldly. Then, he moved his body and appeared above Yu changfei like a ghost. He stared at Yu changfei with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Return it.”</p><p>Yu changfei was shocked. He used all his strength and sent out seven palm strikes. The palm strikes were crystal clear and like jade.</p><p>However, burial only needed a few claw strikes to destroy the Jade palm force. He grabbed Yu changkong’s neck and pressed down hard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
