This person is the strongest in the desolate Wildlands. His cultivation is in the middle of the martial arts Grandmaster 8-dan. He has surpassed the three battle geniuses and is extremely powerful!</p><p>...</p><p>Xiao Haoyu shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s too late to know now. Great desolation divine fist!”</p><p>The burly young man roared and punched.</p><p>This punch caused the entire world to shake. It was as if a continuous mountain range was crashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, a vast mountain floated above the burly young man’s head, and five silver chakras shone brightly.</p><p>The explosion of his bloodline made his punch even more powerful.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>One punch and one kick, they clashed together.</p><p>Then, everyone saw the burly young man’s fist force collapse in an instant, and his steel-like muscles trembled rapidly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, his body was like a deflated leather ball, flying back madly. He flew all the way to 3000 meters before he barely stopped, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The burly young man roared and ran away without hesitation.</p><p>The other people in the Savage Land were even more scared out of their wits. It was as if their butts were on fire as they jumped several thousand meters away.</p><p>In an instant, all the people in the savage area fled.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue them. He would just teach these people a lesson.</p><p>“You two, thank you for saving me. You’re Jian Fengyun!”</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Haoyu flew over and looked at Jian Fengyun carefully. His eyes flashed as if he had recognized Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“Brother Xiao, it’s been a few years since we last met. How have you been?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun laughed.</p><p>“Brother Jian, it’s really you. I didn’t recognize you just now. May I know who this is?”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu looked at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>He had easily defeated the most powerful expert in the Savage Land. With such strength, he could be ranked at the top among all the geniuses who entered the ancient battlefield of the netherworld this time.</p><p>Xiao Haoyu guessed that Lu Ming might be a genius from some super region.</p><p>this is Lu Ming, brother Lu. He’s the Supreme talent of the cloud Emperor mountain range!</p><p>As Jian Fengyun introduced Xiao Haoyu, his tone unknowingly carried a sense of pride.</p><p>“What? Brother Lu is a heaven’s favorite of the cloud Emperor mountain range?”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Brother Xiao doesn’t believe it, there’s nothing to hide.”</p><p>Jian Feng Yun said.</p><p>“I am indeed from the cloud Emperor mountain range,” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>I didn’t expect the cloud Emperor mountain range to have a heaven’s favorite like brother Lu. It’s really an eye-opener!</p><p>Xiao Haoyu exclaimed.</p><p>“Hey, Xiao Haoyu, what do you mean by that? It seems that our cloud Emperor mountain range can’t produce someone like brother Lu?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Brother Jian, you’ve misunderstood me. I didn’t mean it that way!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu smiled wryly and said hurriedly.</p><p>“Brother Lu, brother Jian, are you going to the dragon’s cave?” he quickly changed the topic.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The two of them nodded.</p><p>“Then why don’t we go together?”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu said.</p><p>Lu Ming did not object. Since Lu Ming did not object, Jian Fengyun naturally did not object either.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally had his own thoughts.</p><p>Xiao Haoyu was the strongest person in his region, and his talent and combat strength were not inferior to Jian Fengyun’s. It would not be much of a problem for him to join the Empyrean sky divine guards.</p><p>In the future, when he joined the Ditian divine guards, Lu Ming would not know a single person. There were only benefits and no disadvantages in befriending a few more people.</p><p>The three of them moved forward together.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming also found out why Xiao Haoyu was being hunted down by the people in the Savage Land.</p><p>The reason was that the experts from the various large regions were all hunting down the experts from the small regions, especially the strongest experts from the small regions. They all had hopes of joining the Empyrean sky divine guards, so if they killed these people, the competition in the large regions would become a little less, and perhaps more people would join the Empyrean sky divine guards.</p><p>it seems that the later it gets, the more chaotic it will be!</p><p>Jian Fengyun sighed.</p><p>Only a little more than a month had passed, and those big regions had already started to hunt down the Masters from the small regions. He really didn’t know how chaotic it would be in the later stages.</p><p>This was the goal of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Only by withstanding the numerous dangers and tests could one become an empyrean heaven Divine Guard.</p><p>The three of them advanced, but their speed wasn’t very fast. They were all flying at a low altitude, and as they flew, they searched for spirit herbs.</p><p>The dragon’s lair was a place where many heavenly treasures were born.</p><p>However, along the way, the three of them didn’t gain much. In many places, they saw many pits. Obviously, others had been one step ahead and dug out the spiritual herbs.</p><p>This area was really vast. The three of them had flown for tens of thousands of miles, but they still had not reached the real dragon’s cave.</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s a corpse over there!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun suddenly shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xiao Haoyu also saw that there were a large number of corpses lying in the valley below.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The three of them flew down, and their expressions changed when they saw what was inside.</p><p>In the valley, there were no less than a hundred corpses. All of them were dead. The most shocking thing was that these corpses had all become mummies.</p><p>It was as if all the blood and Qi essence in his body had been sucked away.</p><p>what a strange way of dying. Could it be some strange monster? ”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu sucked in a breath of cold air and furrowed his brows.</p><p>Lu Ming also frowned and pondered.</p><p>His blood and essence had been sucked dry. It was truly evil.</p><p>For example, the bloodline of the nine Dragons could only devour blood essence and bloodline power. It would not devour ordinary blood.</p><p>Then, the three of them continued to move forward. Not far away, they saw another pile of corpses. They were also dried up.</p><p>“That’s the people from the savage Lands!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu exclaimed.</p><p>Some of these corpses were particularly burly, and from their clothes, it was obvious that they were from the savage area.</p><p>even the most powerful man in the Savage Land is dead!</p><p>Jian Fengyun said in a deep voice.</p><p>Among the many corpses, one of them was particularly burly. According to his attire, he was the most powerful man in the Savage Land who had been chased away by Lu Ming.</p><p>this area is too eerie. How did they die? ”</p><p>Jian Feng Yun said.</p><p>Both Jian Fengyun and Xiao Haoyu looked grim.</p><p>Even the most powerful man in the Savage Land had died in this place. It was too terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Jian Fengyun and Xiao Haoyu nodded.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them soared into the sky and left the place.</p><p>However, hundreds of miles away, they saw dozens of corpses that had died in the same way as the previous ones.</p><p>“I have a feeling that something big is going to happen in this trip to the dragon’s cave!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu said in a low voice.</p><p>After that, there was a moment of silence.</p><p>Before long, the three of them had traveled another 10000 miles.</p><p>there are so many people there. What are they doing? ”</p><p>Suddenly, Jian Feng Yun said.</p><p>Not far to the right, there was a huge cliff. Under the cliff, one could see many people gathered.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them flew over.</p><p>“What a powerful sword intent that Gu has!”</p><p>As they flew closer, the three of them saw that there was a sword mark that was a hundred meters long on the cliff. The sword mark emitted a mysterious sword intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
