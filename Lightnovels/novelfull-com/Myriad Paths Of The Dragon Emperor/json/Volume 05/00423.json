The protector of the fire Palace of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The Guardians of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were extremely powerful figures with the ability to destroy the heavens and earth. They were definitely famous figures in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Of course, the Emperor heaven divine Palace here wasn’t the main palace but the eastern branch of the heavenly mystic region.</p><p>On the battle stage, zang Sheng and Qiu changkong snorted coldly and retracted their auras.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and retracted his aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space trembled again, and a figure carrying a long sword appeared.</p><p>“Eh? Xuan Feng of the ancient barren city!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Lu Ming did not see Xuan Feng’s corpse in the underground cave of the dragon’s cave. As expected, he was still alive.</p><p>With Xuan Feng’s combat strength, it was no problem for him to make it to the last level.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>you’re courting death! a cold voice rang out as zang Sheng’s sinister eyes turned to Xuan Feng.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and a powerful sword Qi rippled from Xuan Feng’s body. His eyes were like lightning as he stared at zang Sheng.</p><p>“Hehe, they’ve all appeared. Good, this time, I’ll settle them all!”</p><p>Zang Sheng sneered.</p><p>Xuan Feng also saw the protector of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in the sky. He retracted his aura and walked to the side.</p><p>The audience was extremely excited.</p><p>Between these geniuses, the stronger the smell of gunpowder, the more excited they were, because the upcoming battle would also be more intense.</p><p>The fighting ring was silent. Time slowly passed. The space in the fighting ring trembled from time to time. Someone appeared.</p><p>Very quickly, the number of people had increased to over a dozen.</p><p>Half an hour later, no one else appeared.</p><p>alright, Time’s Up. There are no more participants in the assessment area!</p><p>The protector of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace announced in the sky.</p><p>“No, how is that possible? Phoenix lake’s geniuses, why are there only so few of them? where’s Huang chixuan, where did he go?”</p><p>“My yang Spring Valley too, where’s sun Chu?”</p><p>protector, protector, did you make a mistake? bu Feifan of my Flaming Mountain range is a peerless talent. He will definitely make it to the last level. Why isn’t he here? ”</p><p>The leading elders of Phoenix Lake, Yangquan Valley, Flaming Mountain, and even another super region all shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? If he doesn’t appear, it means he has fallen inside. It means that he doesn’t have enough talent and luck. What’s so strange about that?”</p><p>The middle-aged Guardian rebuked as he looked coldly at the elders leading the teams.</p><p>The few elder leaders immediately kept quiet out of fear. They felt cold all over and did not dare to say a word.</p><p>alright, the previous assessment has ended. Now, let’s start the final battle. The purpose of the battle is to determine the Final Four divine guards of the East sky.</p><p>I’m sure all of you know what the eastern heaven divine guards are. I’ll repeat myself here. When you were teleported into the eastern nether ancient battlefield, you were automatically distributed in four directions, North, South, East, and West. The teleportation altar behind you is also divided into four directions, corresponding to the North, South, East, and West. Your group belongs to the East. Therefore, the strongest person will be the eastern heaven divine guards.</p><p>“The four heavens divine guards represent the four strongest experts in this batch of Emperor heavens divine guards. There will be generous rewards.”</p><p>The middle-aged protector explained in detail.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This was something that many people already knew.</p><p>so, for this battle, the second or third place is not important. What’s important is the first place. I’ll say it again, what’s important is the first place.</p><p>The middle-aged protector shouted, his voice spreading through the entire area.</p><p>On the platform, all the young men’s eyes were shining, and a strong desire to fight rose from their bodies.</p><p>There were a total of 17 young men and women on the fighting ring. Each of them was a genius among geniuses, and each of them had rare talents.</p><p>They had absolute confidence in themselves. They were confident that they were stronger than others.</p><p>“This time, the eastern sky divine guards are mine.”</p><p>A deep voice rang out. It came from a tall and burly young man.</p><p>This person was more than two meters tall, and his entire body was covered in muscles, as if he was cast from steel.</p><p>tie kuangzhong, it’s fine if you’re the Overlord of the iron Peak area, but you’re dreaming if you think you can become the eastern sky Divine Guard here. The eastern sky Divine Guard is mine.</p><p>A beautiful woman with blue hair said in a domineering manner.</p><p>haha, ao feixuan, I think you’d better go home and have a child. You want to take over the East heaven divine guards? ”</p><p>The burly young man sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>The blue-haired beauty, ao feixuan, widened her eyes.</p><p>a bunch of trash wants to take over the eastern sky divine guards? you’re daydreaming.</p><p>Zang Sheng curled his lips and sneered.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Zang Sheng’s words infuriated the crowd. More than ten young experts looked at him with killing intent.</p><p>Zang Sheng smiled indifferently.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged Guardian spoke.</p><p>Everyone shut their mouths.</p><p>“Take this Jade plate.”</p><p>The middle-aged Guardian waved his hand and seventeen Jade plates flew out, one for each of them.</p><p>Everyone took the Jade token in their hands.</p><p>now, inscribe your information into the Jade tokens. I’m going to draw lots with this Jade token later!</p><p>The middle-aged man ordered.</p><p>Everyone’s mind moved and engraved their own information into the Jade token.</p><p>Then, he returned them to the middle-aged Guardian one by one.</p><p>The middle-aged Guardian picked up the Jade tablet and read it aloud.</p><p>this time, a total of 17 people have passed the final stage. They are zang Sheng from the Dragon burial pool, Qiu changkong from the cloud Emperor mountain range, tie kuangzhong from the iron Peak …</p><p>. Lu Ming from the cloud Emperor mountain range, ao feixuan from the Jade Lake Region …”</p><p>The middle-aged man read out the names one by one, and in a few moments, he had finished reading all seventeen names.</p><p>As soon as the middle-aged man finished speaking, the crowd burst into an uproar.</p><p>“Wait, did I hear wrong? I seem to have heard that there are two people from the cloud Emperor mountain range? That poor and remote place?”</p><p>“You didn’t hear wrong, I heard it too, this … This is too f * cking weird, two people actually cleared the level in the cloud Emperor mountain range. Is the sun rising from the West?”</p><p>“The small cloud Emperor mountain range is really crazy this time.”</p><p>The spectators in the stands discussed animatedly and were extremely shocked.</p><p>As for the elders in charge of each region, they were all dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>In the cloud Emperor mountain range, there were two people who passed the level. Previously, they thought that Lu Xiu was talking nonsense.</p><p>He didn’t expect it to be true. This was really unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Xiu was trembling with excitement.</p><p>The tiny Cloud King Mountain range actually produced two such geniuses. This time, his reward would definitely be terrifying.</p><p>“Brother Lu, don’t forget me when you’re successful in the future.”</p><p>“Brother Lu, when this selection is over, I’ll treat you to a meal at the drunken immortal restaurant. Brother Lu, you must come and visit me.”</p><p>……</p><p>Immediately, some of the other elder team leaders beside Lu Xiu, and even some of the elder team leaders from the larger regions, expressed their goodwill to Lu Xiu.</p><p>Lu Xiu was so excited that he almost laughed.</p><p>He had never felt so happy before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
