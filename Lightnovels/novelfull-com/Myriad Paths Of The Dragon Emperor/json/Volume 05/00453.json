Killing him will be as easy as killing an ant. I’ll definitely find a chance to get rid of him.”</p><p>Xue Chao clasped his hands behind his back, looking as if he was looking down on the world.</p><p>“Lu Ming seems to have gone out some time ago.”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Oh, he went out? He’s lucky, let him live for a while longer. Junior Brother Qiu, get someone to keep an eye on him. Inform me as soon as Lu Ming returns!”</p><p>Xue Chao said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior brother!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was overjoyed.</p><p>……</p><p>At the hundred deities slope, Lu Ming was trying his best to merge the three types of forces.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed. Although he had made great progress in the fusion of the three wills, he was still a little bit away from being able to completely fuse them.</p><p>And at this time, the three month deadline of the hundred deities slope was about to arrive.</p><p>Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and rushed out at full speed.</p><p>If he were to travel at full speed, his speed would be much faster. Two days later, Lu Ming had left the hundred deities slope.</p><p>The moment he left the hundred deities slope, the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s entire body instantly recovered. It was like the water of a large river, surging and mighty, reaching the peak of its history.</p><p>I didn’t expect that after being suppressed for three months, I would still improve. I’ve already reached the limit of the 9th tier of the martial ancestor realm. I’ve also comprehended the will of my wind, fire, and Thunder. When I return, I can start to refine my true Yuan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and headed for the myriad Star City.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming entered the Emperor heaven divine Palace and returned to the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that guy, is finally back!”</p><p>A low voice came from the clouds not far away. Then, a figure flashed and disappeared.</p><p>East heaven courtyard.</p><p>now, I’ll start refining my true Yuan with the three intents!</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three powerful concepts burst forth but disappeared in a flash. Lu Ming controlled the three concepts and fused them into his dantian.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the three intents struck the vortex as if they were forging iron.</p><p>The cyclone trembled, and something that looked like sparks flew out.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to control the three concepts of heaven and earth, bombarding the vortex continuously.</p><p>There were constantly sparks flying out.</p><p>They were the impurities in his true Qi.</p><p>Refining true essence was like tempering steel.</p><p>True Qi was like mixed iron, and true essence was like steel.</p><p>If it was not for the essence realm of heaven and earth, there was no other way to achieve this.</p><p>At the peak of the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm, one’s true Qi was already extremely condensed. It was easier said than done to temper it.</p><p>This was especially true for Lu Ming, who was at the ninth stage of the true war Dragon technique. His true Qi had been condensed to the extreme, and the difficulty of tempering was extremely shocking.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming cultivated three types of heaven and earth concepts at the same time. The tempering effect was many times stronger than that of one concept alone. It was not as simple as multiplying by three.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three types of heaven and earth intent realms continued to bombard, causing sparks to fly in all directions and rumbling sounds to ring out.</p><p>At the same time, a series of Dragon roars could be heard.</p><p>Half an hour later, the vortex suddenly shook violently. Immediately after, a crystal-clear liquid-like substance floated out.</p><p>true origin Energy! Haha, I’ve finally refined a strand of true origin Energy!</p><p>After that, Lu Ming put in even more effort in tempering.</p><p>After the first wisp of true essence was born, the rest was much easier as more true essence was refined.</p><p>Two hours later, the true Qi in the Qi cyclone and meridians had all been refined into crystal clear true essence.</p><p>However, Lu Ming discovered a fact. The amount of essential core was too little. It was less than one percent of the essential Qi.</p><p>From true Qi to true essence, it was like momentum to intent. It was a qualitative improvement.</p><p>True essence was tens or even hundreds of times more condensed than true Qi. Of course, it was also many times more powerful.</p><p>Once true Qi was refined into true essence, he could probably only refine one portion out of a hundred portions.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming felt that his dantian and meridians were empty.</p><p>“Top-grade spirit crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a total of 10000 to 5000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared beside him.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All 5,000 Supreme spiritual crystals exploded.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline opened its mouth and swallowed. The surging spiritual Qi of heaven and earth gushed into the nine Dragon bloodline’s mouth like a tidal wave. Then, it turned into essential Qi and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>It replenished the essential Qi in Lu Ming’s body. Very soon, Lu Ming’s body was filled with surging essential Qi again.</p><p>“I’ll continue the tempering!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming started the tempering process again.</p><p>After the genuine Qi was transformed into genuine vitality, there was a constant surge of genuine Qi from the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The vital essence in Lu Ming’s body was increasing.</p><p>1%, 2%, 3%</p><p>Very soon, the 5000 pieces of spiritual crystals were all used up. Lu Ming took out another 5000 pieces of spiritual crystals.</p><p>The process of tempering one’s quintessential essence consumed a lot of top-grade spirit crystals. Therefore, Lu Ming had already exchanged for them.</p><p>The tempering was going on madly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>In three days, Lu Ming had used up all the best-grade spirit crystals he had. At this time, Lu Ming’s vital essence had only reached 50%.</p><p>Terrifying. It was really terrifying. Lu Ming had a total of 45000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>the amount of energy required for the true war Dragon technique is too terrifying. An ordinary person would need 7000 to 8000 pieces, or at most 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals, to complete the task. But I need so much energy. It’s too terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>it seems that I need to get a batch of top-grade spiritual crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>In fact, it was also possible to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to replenish and slowly temper it.</p><p>However, that would take too long and Lu Ming could not afford to waste it.</p><p>top-grade spiritual crystals! How can I get enough of them? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought hard.</p><p>He had already sold everything he could and exchanged them for Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Now, he really didn’t have much left to sell.</p><p>I obtained some Dragon’s saliva from the dragon’s cave. I was planning to keep it to cultivate the true war Dragon technique, but now that I’ve cultivated it to the ninth stage, I can’t use it anymore. I can sell it!</p><p>also, I can sell the sword-shaped plant I got at the hundred gods slope. I’m sure I can get a good price for it!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>“Oh right, there’s also that guy’s storage ring!”</p><p>He thought of the storage ring of the burly young man he had killed at the hundred deities slope.</p><p>He immediately opened it and read it.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>There were 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals and a few other random items that were probably worth more than 1000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>That burly young man was the son of a Guardian of the wind Palace. It was normal for him to have so many top-grade spirit crystals. He was most likely saving them up to refine his vital essence. Now, Lu Ming had taken all of them.</p><p>“Let’s go to Qi Zhen Lou!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked towards the mystical Treasure Hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
