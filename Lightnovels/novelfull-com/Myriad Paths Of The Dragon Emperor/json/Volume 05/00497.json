Only intent crystals can quickly level up these two intent realms. However, it’s not realistic to buy a large number of intent crystals. I’ll go take a look at the mystical treasure house later!</p><p>...</p><p>Intent crystals, consumables that were extremely effective in comprehending intent, were too hard to buy.</p><p>This was because everyone needed it, and there would be no surplus. If they bought it, it would be consumed. It might be possible to buy a small amount, but it would be difficult to buy a large amount.</p><p>the spiritual crystals I have now should be enough for me to break through to the second level of the martial King realm!</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had obtained the bald man’s storage ring and the storage rings of the six kings, including Xue Chao, from the battle at the mystical sword sect.</p><p>He had obtained many top-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had 150000 high quality spiritual crystals.</p><p>In the martial King realm, the most important thing was to comprehend the will of heaven and earth. Only by breaking through the will of heaven and earth could one’s cultivation break through.</p><p>Once the essence realm of heaven and earth broke through, it would be much easier to improve one’s cultivation.</p><p>As long as there were enough resources and enough energy, one could make a breakthrough in cultivation.</p><p>Supreme spiritual crystals were undoubtedly the most suitable.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had an advantage. He had the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. The speed at which he refined Supreme-grade spirit crystals was tens or even hundreds of times faster than others.</p><p>now, I’ll improve my cultivation first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Thunder will had long reached the initial level one will. In other words, as long as Lu Ming had enough resources, he could break through to the fourth level martial King realm without any bottlenecks.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core spread out and 10000 top-grade spirit crystals exploded. The spiritual energy in the courtyard was extremely rich.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. It opened its mouth and inhaled. The majestic spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was swallowed by the bloodline of the nine Dragons like water.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons began to be refined rapidly.</p><p>Even the best spiritual crystals had impurities and it would take time to refine them. At most, it would take dozens or even 100 pieces.</p><p>However, Lu Ming refined tens of thousands of top-grade spirit crystals at the same time at a terrifying speed.</p><p>If others saw this, they would be scared to death.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘bloodline seemed to be breathing. With every breath, an extremely pure energy surged into Lu Ming’s body and was absorbed by him, turning into quintessential essence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased rapidly and he was approaching the late-stage of the LV 1 martial King realm.</p><p>Very soon, 10000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals were refined. Lu Ming took out another 10000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and began refining.</p><p>When Lu Ming had refined 30000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, his body trembled and a Dragon’s Roar was heard.</p><p>He had broken through to the late Lv 1 martial King realm!</p><p>Oh my God, I’ve refined 30000 pieces of top-quality spiritual crystals to break through from the middle stage of the LV 1 martial King realm to the late stage. It’s too costly. I still have 120000 pieces of top-quality spiritual crystals with me. I think I can only break through to the early stage of the LV 2 martial King realm at most!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless at the consumption of the best-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>This consumption was too terrifying. How could ordinary people afford it?</p><p>I don’t care anymore. No matter how many resources I consume, increasing my strength is the only way!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out 10000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals and exploded them all. He then began to devour and refine them.</p><p>At this moment, Sheng Wushuang, Sheng Kong, and Sheng Wei arrived outside the eastern heaven courtyard.</p><p>brothers, this is the East sky courtyard where Lu Ming lives. He has just returned not long ago and should be inside. However, there is a large inscription formation guarding the courtyard!</p><p>Sheng Wushuang revealed a flattering smile and spoke to Sheng Kong and Sheng Wei.</p><p>In the Sheng family, the status of direct descendants and branch descendants were too different.</p><p>The Sheng family had been in the Tianxuan region for too long. They had countless branches, and many of them were no different from servants.</p><p>Although Sheng Wushuang was extremely talented, he was still nothing in the eyes of the Sheng family’s direct descendants.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>yes. Sheng Kong nodded slightly and said, ” so what if there’s a rune formation? ” Just blast it out directly.”</p><p>After saying that, the Holy sky struck out with a palm.</p><p>The earth spiritual Qi in the world gathered madly and turned into a huge yellow hand.</p><p>The hand was as big as a small mountain, and it directly smacked down on the eastern heaven courtyard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The eastern heaven courtyard glowed and runes appeared, forming a light screen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge yellow hand hit the light curtain. Although it didn’t break the light curtain, the eastern heaven courtyard started to shake.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was refining the spiritual Qi of the Supreme-grade spirit crystal with all his might. Suddenly, the entire courtyard shook violently as if it was about to explode.</p><p>This was too sudden. Lu Ming was shocked. In his shock, the essential core in his body could not help but run wild.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned red and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Damn it, who is it? You actually dare to attack the eastern sky courtyard!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He then circulated the true war Dragon technique with all his might to stabilize the chaotic vital essence.</p><p>Outside, the sacred sky palm shook the entire mountain.</p><p>One figure after another flew into the sky.</p><p>“Who’s there? You dare to attack the eastern sky courtyard? this is against the rules!”</p><p>look, that’s Sheng Wushuang. Who is he with? ”</p><p>The others began to discuss.</p><p>“Who’s there? You actually dare to attack the courtyard of another Ditian Divine Guard. You’ve already broken the rules. Follow me to the enforcement Hall to be punished!”</p><p>A Deacon flew over and shouted angrily.</p><p>you’re the one who’s bold. This is the Sheng family’s matter. Get lost!</p><p>go! Sheng Kong shouted and waved his hand. A purple-gold Jade token flew out and enlarged rapidly. There was a flash of light on it, and two big golden words were carved in the middle. Shengtian.</p><p>“The Sheng family’s sacred sky token!”</p><p>The Deacon’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>In the Sheng family, only the direct descendants of the Sheng family, and only the extremely outstanding ones, had the divine sky medallion. It represented one’s status.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. A direct descendant of the Sheng family had actually appeared here?</p><p>Could it be that he was here to stand up for Sheng Wushuang?</p><p>How could Sheng Wushuang be so powerful that he could invite a direct descendant of the Sheng family?</p><p>“Hmph, now, why aren’t you getting lost!”</p><p>Shengkong berated.</p><p>The deacon squeezed out an ugly smile on his face. He glanced at the eastern sky courtyard, gritted his teeth, and left.</p><p>Rules were useful to ordinary people. However, the Sheng clan was one of the two strongest clans in the Tianxuan region. They simply ignored these rules.</p><p>“Continue! Let’s see if you’ll come out!”</p><p>The Holy sky struck out another palm. A huge palm print crashed down on the eastern heaven courtyard, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>In the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>He then focused his mind and focused on stabilizing his true Yuan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The palm prints of the Holy sky kept striking down. The eastern heaven courtyard was like a small boat in a storm, shaking continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming is done for. Sheng Wushuang actually invited a direct descendant of the Sheng family.</p><p>these two’s auras are unfathomable. They’re definitely not ordinary King tiers!</p><p>in my opinion, there must be something else. It’s just Sheng Wushuang. I’m afraid the direct descendants of the Sheng family wouldn’t come so far to find trouble with Lu Ming!</p><p>The other Ditian divine guards whispered among themselves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
