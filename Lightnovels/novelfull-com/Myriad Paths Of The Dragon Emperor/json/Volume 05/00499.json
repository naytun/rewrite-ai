It exploded piece by piece and disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Although the three-colored true dragon was much smaller, it still pounced toward the Holy aura.</p><p>Shengwei’s body trembled violently as he retreated.</p><p>The scene was dead silent.</p><p>Lu Ming was way too powerful. Not only had he broken through to the martial King realm, but he was also no match for the Holy aura of a peak Lv 2 martial King. This was unbelievable.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and waved his hand. A huge palm print enveloped the Holy sky.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The Saint sky roared. On the other side, the Saint might had also recovered. It burst out with all its power and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>When the two of them joined forces, their power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few explosions, shengwei coughed out blood and retreated like a cannonball.</p><p>Then, there was another crisp slap. Lu Ming had slapped Holy sky’s face again.</p><p>“The third slap!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>“Die, die, little bastard, I want you to die without a burial place!”</p><p>die! the sacred sky roared like a madman. He was going crazy.</p><p>Who was he? He was a direct descendant of the Sheng family, and a peerless genius at that. He had grown up with a golden spoon in his mouth. Who would dare to treat him like this?</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, he was slapped three times by Lu Ming. This was worse than killing him.</p><p>“So much nonsense, fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he charged towards the Holy sky again.</p><p>The Holy sky roared in anger and attacked Lu Ming madly, but it was all in vain.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>He received another heavy slap on his face. It was extremely clear and could be heard clearly.</p><p>“The fourth slap!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard again.</p><p>”</p><p>The Holy sky roared wildly, his heart on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The others felt a chill in their gums, as if this slap had landed on their faces.</p><p>Lu Ming, let go of Holy sky. Do you know that you’ve caused a great disaster? ”</p><p>On the side, shengwei roared. His face was full of horror, and he didn’t dare to help.</p><p>“What a joke, I slapped him a few times and it’s a great disaster? He just attacked the eastern sky courtyard. Why don’t you say that he has caused a great disaster?”</p><p>Lu Ming chided with a cold smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re the direct descendants of the Sheng family, did you know that? We are different from you!”</p><p>die! Sheng Wei roared, especially addressing the direct descendants of the Sheng family.</p><p>what Bullsh * t direct descendant of the Sheng family? he’s worthless in my eyes!</p><p>Pa!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, he slapped sacred sky’s face again.</p><p>“The fifth slap!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The sixth slap!</p><p>The seventh slap!</p><p>…</p><p>The sound of slaps rang out continuously. At the scene, everyone was dumbfounded as they looked on in a daze.</p><p>Especially Sheng Wushuang, whose face was drained of all color and his body was trembling in fear.</p><p>At that moment, Sheng Kong’s face was swollen like a pig’s head. All the meridians in his body were sealed, and he had completely lost the power to resist.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>When Lu Ming was done with his eighth slap and was about to give his ninth, an earth-shattering roar came from afar.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, you’re dead. Put down the Holy sky!</p><p>Hearing this voice, shengwei was overjoyed, because this voice belonged to the elder’s sacred glory.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and a cold glint flashed in his eyes. However, his palm did not stop and he slapped down for the ninth time.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Sheng Kong’s entire body was sent flying.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The voice rang out again, filled with rage and cold killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>There were two more figures at the scene.</p><p>One of them was the master of thunder Palace, and the other was an elder of the Sheng family, Sheng Yao.</p><p>At this moment, their eyes were filled with a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming that little b * stard has broken through to the martial King realm and his combat strength is so strong. Chao ‘er, changkong and the rest are probably dead!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart.</p><p>Previously, he thought that someone was helping Lu Ming. However, it was proven that Lu Ming did not need anyone’s help at all. The experts that he had sent were not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>He had already tried his best to overestimate Lu Ming. He had set up a chain of traps and even sent a third level martial King and four second level martial King experts to deal with Lu Ming, who was only a half step King. This was simply an impossible situation to fail in, but it had failed.</p><p>“Little bastard, I told you to stop, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>Sacred light looked at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze.</p><p>“Didn’t I just stop?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you know who this is? This is an elder of the Sheng family. How dare you quibble in front of an elder of the Sheng family? you’re courting death!”</p><p>also, how dare you injure the hero of the Sheng family? you’ve committed a grave crime. Shouldn’t you kneel down and destroy your cultivation? ”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master shouted.</p><p>“Plead guilty? Hehe, that guy attacked the eastern sky courtyard without asking for the right or wrong. According to the rules, he should be punished. I was just fighting back. What crime do I have?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently without any fear.</p><p>“Shut up, Who are you? How can a lowly life be compared to the Sheng family’s direct line of descent? kneel down and admit your guilt!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master shouted.</p><p>I’ll kneel to your mother. Old man, you think you’re a dog, but don’t think of others as dogs. If you want to kneel and lick the Sheng family’s boots, then go back and slowly kneel and lick them!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>He was already filled with killing intent towards the palace master of thunder Palace. Now that the palace master of thunder Palace kept calling him a little bastard and then knelt down to admit his guilt, Lu Ming was instantly enraged. He did not give him any face at all.</p><p>The other Ditian divine guards were dumbfounded. This Lu Ming was simply too audacious. He actually dared to scold the Thunder Palace Master in public.</p><p>As expected, the Thunder Palace master’s face turned red and his body trembled with anger. He pointed at Lu Ming and shouted, ” “Treasonous, treasonous!”</p><p>“Brother Zheng, why are you wasting your breath on him? We’ll talk after we cripple his cultivation!”</p><p>die! the Holy brilliance shouted coldly and raised his hand. A terrifying fire concept burst out, forming a giant flaming hand that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The world was scorching hot.</p><p>Both of them had the same fire concept, but the Holy power and the Holy brilliance were trash. They were worlds apart. There was no comparison at all.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He could feel a terrifying aura of death approaching him. The aura was so strong that he could not resist it at all. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The divine Guard’s token glowed. Behind Lu Ming, the protective light screen of the eastern sky courtyard cracked open and Lu Ming rushed in.</p><p>Then, the light screen gathered.</p><p>“Hide? Was there any use hiding inside? Break!”</p><p>Holy light shouted coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge fire palm directly hit the light curtain of the eastern sky courtyard. The light curtain shook violently, and the entire mountain peak shook as if it was going to explode.</p><p>However, in the end, the light screen still managed to block the attack.</p><p>“Eh? Again!”</p><p>Sacred light frowned and struck out with another palm. This palm was several times stronger than the previous one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
