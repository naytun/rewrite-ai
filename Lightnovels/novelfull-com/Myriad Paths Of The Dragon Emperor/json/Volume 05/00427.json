He was just a guy who relied on luck. He was not worthy of his attention or regard.</p><p>After the burial, it would be the last battle.</p><p>There wasn’t much suspense in this match.</p><p>One was a genius in the late stage of martial ancestor realm, while the other was in the early stage of martial ancestor realm. Both of them were battle-hardened geniuses. With their cultivation levels falling behind, it would be difficult for them to turn the tables.</p><p>After more than 20 moves, the genius in the late 9th level of martial ancestor realm won.</p><p>This martial ancestor realm 9-dan later stage genius was called Song Yan. He was a genius from a super large region and had a cold expression.</p><p>At this point, the five geniuses who had entered the third round were born.</p><p>They were zang Sheng, Qiu changkong, Xuan Feng, Song Yan, and Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was directly ignored by everyone.</p><p>Up until now, Lu Ming had yet to make a move. In the eyes of the crowd, he was just lucky.</p><p>This time, the selection of the East heaven divine guards would definitely be decided among the five of them. Most people would place more importance on Qiu changkong and zang Sheng.</p><p>now, let’s do the last lot drawing. The rules are the same. From number one to four, the other area will be free!</p><p>The middle-aged judge announced.</p><p>Then, just like before, he removed the aura on the Jade tokens and suspended them in the air.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not take any action and just waited there.</p><p>Burial, Qiu changkong, and the rest each chose a Jade tablet. Lu Ming only kept the last one in his hand.</p><p>“This time, I wonder who will get the bye token?”</p><p>no matter who has it, I bet it won’t be with Lu Ming. If he can get another free pass, I’ll strip naked and run one round around this place.</p><p>“So ruthless?”</p><p>“It’s that ruthless, because I don’t believe that there’s such a lucky person in the world.”</p><p>There were all sorts of voices in the audience.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming flipped the Jade card over and took a look. His expression immediately turned very strange.</p><p>The bye card, he got the bye card again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips trembled when he drew the bye card for the third time.</p><p>“Give me your numbers!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector said.</p><p>“Number one!”</p><p>Burial flipped the Jade token.</p><p>“I’m number two!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang opened the Jade token.</p><p>“I’ll be number four!”</p><p>Song Yan said.</p><p>In the end, Xuan Feng gave Lu Ming a strange look and opened the Jade card. “I’m number three!”</p><p>Silence!</p><p>When Xuan Feng flipped the Jade token over, the entire Hall fell silent.</p><p>The crowd was silent. They looked at Lu Ming in a daze. Then, their eyes widened.</p><p>A moment later, there was a loud noise.</p><p>“Nest, nest, nest, nest, nest, it’s him again, it’s him again.”</p><p>isn’t this too heaven-defying. He got another bye card and directly entered the top three. He didn’t even fight a single round and entered the top three. It’s really blinding my eyes.</p><p>“This is too unfair.”</p><p>Some people were already incoherent.</p><p>“Hey, what did you just say? If Lu Ming draws the bye card again, you will strip naked and run away on the spot. Now, hurry up!”</p><p>“What? What? What did you just say? Why can’t I hear you? oh no, I’m suddenly deaf. No, I have to find an inscriber to take a look.”</p><p>The perverted burly man who threatened to take off all his clothes immediately played dumb and found an excuse to slip away.</p><p>nest, this guy is so shameless. He didn’t keep his word.</p><p>Someone cursed.</p><p>In short, the entire place was in chaos.</p><p>As for Lu Xiu, Jian Fengyun, Jiang hongwen, and the others, they were completely petrified. They were tongue-tied and didn’t know what to say.</p><p>The eyelids of the middle-aged protector of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace kept twitching.</p><p>However, no one noticed that Lu Ming was also sighing and sighing. Slowly, he opened the Jade card helplessly.</p><p>The two big words ‘bye’ were clearly written.</p><p>“I object, this is not fair!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout was heard.</p><p>Instantly, all sound disappeared. The entire place became so quiet that even the sound of a needle falling could be heard.</p><p>Everyone was stunned, and all their eyes were focused on the person who shouted.</p><p>The person who was screaming that it was unfair was actually Lu Ming. It was Lu Ming!</p><p>Everyone was in a mess.</p><p>Big brother, you’re the one who drew the bye card, and you’ve drawn the bye card three times. It’s not anyone else, and now you’re actually crying out that it’s unfair? If this was unfair, then the others would be vomiting blood.</p><p>Even zang Sheng, Qiu changkong, and the others ‘lips were twitching non-stop. They were completely dumbfounded by Lu Ming.</p><p>“How is it unfair?”</p><p>The middle-aged protector took a deep breath to calm himself down and asked.</p><p>the others can fight each other and have their own opponents, but I don’t. I just watch others fight each time. It’s so boring. It’s not fair!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>That was indeed what he was thinking. Why was Qiu changkong getting a bye every time? what if Qiu changkong was defeated by someone else? how was he going to torture Qiu changkong and avenge Lu Yuntian?</p><p>No one else knew what he was thinking. Suddenly, the crowd burst into an uproar.</p><p>nest, this guy is too despicable. He’s simply taking advantage of us and still acting innocent.</p><p>“I can’t take it anymore. I really can’t stand it anymore. Oh heavens, Oh earth, please strike him to death with a heavenly lightning bolt.”</p><p>The scene was noisy.</p><p>Other people wanted to draw an empty card, but they couldn’t. He, on the other hand, drew it every time and even felt uncomfortable.</p><p>Guardian, why don’t I exchange with someone else? Xuan Feng, him. I’ll exchange with him!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xuan Feng’s opponent happened to be Qiu changkong.</p><p>“No way, this is the rule of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. The rules can not be ignored. If you draw the bye, it means that you won’t be able to get the bye.”</p><p>The middle-aged protector gritted his teeth as he spoke. He had never mentioned the rules of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace for this reason.</p><p>“This … Oh, okay then!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and walked to the platform. He waved his hand and took out a chair. He sat down and stared at the center of the platform in a daze.</p><p>He looked very unwilling and helpless.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>At the sight of this scene, everyone gritted their teeth. Even Jian Fengyun and the others were in the same state. They could not wait to slash at Lu Ming. He was too hateful.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyelids suddenly twitched a few times. He took a deep breath and coughed a few times before saying, ” “Silence!”</p><p>Only then did the scene slowly quieten down.</p><p>alright, next, let the battle begin. Number one, Buried Life, against number four, Song Yan.</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xuan Feng walked to the side, leaving only zang Sheng and Song Yan in the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Song Yan right? hurry up and admit defeat, you’re not my match.”</p><p>Zang Sheng looked at Song Yan with contempt.</p><p>you’re talking big. Zang Sheng, you may be strong, but I’m not afraid of you. This time, I’m determined to win the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>Song Yan wielded his saber, and his saber aura soared into the sky.</p><p>“You? You want to take over the eastern sky divine guards? Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at? since that’s the case, I’ll let you see the gap between us.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as zang Sheng’s voice fell, an extremely powerful aura erupted from his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
