Whatever methods you use are just a waste of time, Gu!</p><p>At first, the blood-robed young man snorted coldly and was calm and composed. However, the next moment, he screamed in panic.</p><p>Because dandan completely ignored those tentacles and went through them, directly smashing towards the blood-robed young man’s face.</p><p>The blood-robed youth dodged with all his might, but in the end, he died.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Blood spurted out as the blood-robed youth’s face was smashed into a pile of dog shit.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man roared. His figure flashed and he kept his distance from Lu Ming. He roared,”Dammit! Dammit! Take control of the Grand formation and kill him!”</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>A portion of the tentacles swarmed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with all his strength and rushed forward with all his might.</p><p>The heavenly path palm and the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps were executed in succession.</p><p>Before, because most of the tentacles had been used to deal with bu Feifan and the other two, his tentacles were relatively weak, and he immediately blasted a passage.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The tentacles exploded and Lu Ming dashed thousands of meters away in an instant.</p><p>He was already close to the pitch-black area.</p><p>When he got closer, he saw an abyss.</p><p>The other end of the cave was actually an abyss.</p><p>The abyss was pitch-black, and it was impossible to see how deep it was. Black mist filled the air, making it look extremely terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh whoosh</p><p>The tentacles swarmed toward Lu Ming in a frenzy. They were many times more concentrated than before.</p><p>“Brat, go to hell!”</p><p>The blood-robed youth’s eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and kicked out. The last tentacles in front of him were directly crushed by him. Then, he leaped and jumped into the abyss.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man’s figure flashed and appeared beside the abyss. He looked at the abyss with fear, but he did not dare to pursue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two black-robed figures appeared beside the blood-robed youth.</p><p>eldest senior brother, what should we do? this guy jumped into the abyss. Should we pursue him? ”</p><p>One of the black-robed men asked.</p><p>“No need. This abyss is the most dangerous place in a Dragon’s Den. Even if I cultivate the Dragon’s devour divine technique, I’ll still die if I go in. This guy will definitely die if he jumps in. It’s just that it’s too easy for him to die in the abyss.”</p><p>The blood-robed youth said coldly.</p><p>“Now, attack with all your might and kill the three of them!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man pointed at bu Feifan and the other two.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>yes, ” the black-robed man replied and used all his strength to control the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea what was going on above. He jumped into the abyss and suddenly felt a strong force sweeping over him. His body could not help but fall rapidly.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>Gusts of wind blew past his ears, and black mist surrounded him.</p><p>Through the black mist, Lu Ming realized that the abyss was very wide.</p><p>It was also very deep. Lu Ming fell for at least tens of thousands of meters before he felt his body lighten. The force disappeared and he could fly in the air again.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential Qi and stopped his fall. He slowly floated down.</p><p>After about a thousand meters, they finally reached the bottom.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped on the ground, there was a cracking sound.</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his head and was slightly shocked.</p><p>On the ground, there were white bones.</p><p>Human bones.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and gasped.</p><p>The ground was covered in white bones. It was unknown how many of them were there.</p><p>Moreover, they were all in human form.</p><p>could it be that all the human warriors who have entered this place for countless years have turned into white bones? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and his heart could not help but turn heavy. He focused his attention and observed his surroundings at all times.</p><p>The surroundings were completely silent. There was not a single sound.</p><p>Coupled with the White bones on the ground, Lu Ming seemed to have come to the abyss of hell.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons is extremely excited about this place. There must be something here that is attracting the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Let’s search around.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and began to walk forward to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his essential Qi and walked in the air, ignoring the White bones.</p><p>After moving forward for a few thousand meters, they still found nothing.</p><p>Wuwuwu</p><p>At this moment, a strong wind suddenly blew across the world.</p><p>The wind was cold and gloomy, and it gave people goosebumps.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>All of a sudden, a loud roar was heard and a black shadow pounced on Lu Ming with a terrifying momentum.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He pulled out his long spear and collided with the black shadow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a loud boom and Lu Ming felt a surge of energy surging towards him like the water of the sea. His body trembled and he could not help but retreat. The qi and blood in his body were in turmoil!</p><p>“This is a horned dragon?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could finally see clearly what the black shadow that attacked him was. It was actually a huge Dragon.</p><p>There were five dragon claws on its abdomen, and it was completely black.</p><p>Five claws, a true dragon!</p><p>No, not a true dragon!</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming could clearly see that the true dragon was not a physical entity but was condensed from energy.</p><p>It was formed by a black energy. This energy was filled with a brutal, fiendish, and evil aura.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Black Dragon’s attack missed. It roared angrily and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Before it even arrived, it brought with it a violent wind, whistling through the air.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and collided with the Black Dragon.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>Strong. This Black Dragon was too strong. It was much stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. He turned and ran.</p><p>The Black Dragon roared as it pursued.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming had not even run a hundred meters when a roar came from ahead. A Black Dragon that was dozens of meters long appeared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Another one!</p><p>The front and back formed a pincer attack.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>And that wasn’t all. On the left and right sides, loud roars sounded as two black dragons appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed completely.</p><p>He wasn’t even a match for one black Dragon, let alone four.</p><p>Moreover, who knew if there would be more?</p><p>As if to confirm Lu Ming’s words, a series of roars rang out in the distance. There were at least a dozen of them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned the color of a pig’s liver. He wished he could give himself a tight slap.</p><p>This was really what he wanted.</p><p>As they roared, more than ten black giant Dragons appeared and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>now, I can only try the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>In the next moment, the blood light surged and the nine Dragon bloodline appeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As soon as the bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared, it roared at the Black Dragons.</p><p>The Black Dragons trembled and stopped, looking at the bloodline of the nine Dragons in fear.</p><p>“It’s effective!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was overjoyed.</p><p>The formation of these black dragons was definitely related to the true dragon, and the nine Dragons were even above the true dragon. As expected, they had a deterrent effect on these black dragons.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the bloodline of the nine Dragons roared and flew out. A powerful devouring power erupted from its mouth and enveloped a Black Dragon.</p><p>The Black Dragon screamed in fear and struggled with all its might.</p><p>However, the bloodline of the nine Dragons rushed over and grabbed the Black Dragon’s neck with its claws.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
