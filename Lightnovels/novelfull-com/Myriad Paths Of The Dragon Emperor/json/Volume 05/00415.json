Furthermore, the three types of intent realms had to be completely fused together in order to cultivate it to the highest realm.</p><p>Above the control force was the intent realm.</p><p>They were the intent realms of wind, fire, and Thunder. Only by comprehending these three intent realms and merging them into one could one cultivate the three absolutes of the Dragon God to the highest realm.</p><p>However, it wasn’t necessary for one to comprehend three intents before one could cultivate it. According to the records, one could cultivate it after comprehending one intent, but the power would be much weaker.</p><p>Comprehending a kind of intent realm and cultivating the Dragon God’s three absolutes, the power of the Dragon God’s three absolutes was about the same as an upper earth grade martial technique.</p><p>And if one comprehended two intents and fused them together, the power would reach heaven grade low-rank.</p><p>After comprehending three kinds of intent, its power could reach heaven grade top-rank.</p><p>According to Lei Xu’s speculation, three intents weren’t the limit. If he could comprehend four intents and merge them together, the power of the three absolutes of the Dragon God would be even stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lei Xu was born with three kinds of intent realms. In the end, he didn’t even comprehend The Fourth Kind.</p><p>“Intent, intent, I’m still far from it. I haven’t even reached the peak of control force.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>could it be that one can’t cultivate without comprehending intent? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little indignant. He carefully read the message in his mind.</p><p>A moment later, he revealed a hint of joy.</p><p>This time, he had a new discovery.</p><p>One didn’t need to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth to cultivate it. As long as one comprehended the corresponding Shi, one could also cultivate it, just that one couldn’t cultivate it to a high level.</p><p>Coincidentally, Lu Ming had comprehended the force of Wind and Fire, which corresponded to the Wind and Fire concepts. If he cultivated the three absolutes of the Dragon God, its power would be equivalent to a low-grade heaven-level martial technique.</p><p>However, with two of Lu Ming’s Shi at the peak of phenomenal success, he could only cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the first level at most.</p><p>Only when both forces reached perfection could they be cultivated to the second level. This was the limit. If one wanted to cultivate to a higher level, they would have to comprehend the will of heaven and earth.</p><p>“Haha, the first level is good enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He was very satisfied.</p><p>One must know that he had fused two types of forces and had already successfully fused them. The Dragon God’s three absolutes was equivalent to the power of a low-rank heaven grade martial technique.</p><p>The power of the first stage of a heaven grade lower level martial skill was already at the highest level of an earth grade martial skill.</p><p>In other words, as long as Lu Ming cultivated the first stage of the three absolutes of Dragon God, its power would completely surpass the heavenly Dao palm and become Lu Ming’s strongest killing move.</p><p>when my Wind and Fire power evolves into the essence realm of heaven and earth, I’ll comprehend the essence realm of Thunder. Then, the three absolutes of the Dragon God will be even more powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>this stone inscription actually contains such a powerful supreme art. How wonderful. Let me take a look again!</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming stared at the stone inscription and started to read it seriously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The environment suddenly changed.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming appeared in a different place. This time, he appeared in the starry sky.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded. In the starry sky, a three-colored true dragon flew over. Its five dragon claws stepped forward. With every step, the world rumbled and the space cracked like a spider web.</p><p>“True dragon steps!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body trembled. His eyes widened as he stared at the three-colored true dragon’s claw.</p><p>The true dragon steps reminded him of the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>Although the nine Dragons were more powerful than the true dragon, Lu Ming was still too far away from that level.</p><p>Not to mention the nine Dragons, even the true dragon was tens of thousands of times stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>There were similarities between the true dragon steps and the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps. Lu Ming suddenly felt enlightened. Some parts of the nine Dragons heaven-trampling steps that he could not comprehend were instantly understood and became smooth.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He then took a step forward.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Heaven and earth rumbled, and heaven and earth suddenly shattered. The environment changed. Lu Ming found that he was still in the abyss, looking up at the stone carvings.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, I’ll try it out!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He didn’t dare to test it in the abyss. He was afraid that if he took a step out, he would destroy the abyss. Everything else was fine, but it would be a pity if he destroyed that stone inscription.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming said softly and took a step forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step on the Supreme shrine’s platform, and it seemed as if the entire Supreme shrine was shaking.</p><p>Fortunately, the Supreme shrine was a treasure of the nine suns Supreme. Lu Ming could not destroy it with his cultivation base.</p><p>The Supreme shrine only trembled for a moment before it returned to its calm state.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took another step.</p><p>This step wasn’t to start from the beginning, but to take another step on the foundation of the first.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven trampling steps, two steps in a row.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally cultivated to the second step.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The world buzzed and a mysterious aura rippled under Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With this step, the Supreme shrine shook violently again, even more so than before.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming then took a deep breath.</p><p>“What a powerful pressure!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>With every step of the nine Dragons sky-treading steps, his body would feel a powerful pressure from heaven and earth. With two steps, the pressure would be multiplied.</p><p>Of course, its power was also extremely terrifying.</p><p>it’s even more powerful than the heaven path palm. It’s just barely at the heaven-grade low-rank.</p><p>according to the records of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, the first two steps are considered to be building the foundation. The increase in power is not very obvious. From the third step onwards, the power will increase by several times with each step. That is the true horror. However, the difficulty of the cultivation will also increase by several times.</p><p>“This stone inscription is too wonderful. Let me take a look again.”</p><p>Next, Lu Ming looked at the stone inscription.</p><p>The environment changed again. This time, the three-colored true dragon was still in the starry sky. This time, Lu Ming only observed carefully and did not notice anything.</p><p>Not long after, the three-colored true Dragon’s body began to transform rapidly. In the end, it actually turned into a handsome middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man was wearing a tri-colored robe. A long spear appeared in his hand and he began to wave it.</p><p>“This is the Dragon God’s three absolutes!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he began to take a closer look.</p><p>The Dragon God’s three absolutes were divided into three moves.</p><p>They were the true dragon Strike, the ten thousand Dragon kill, and the extreme strike.</p><p>The first two moves could be cultivated no matter how many intents or forces one had comprehended.</p><p>Only the third move, the extreme strike, could be practiced after one had comprehended the wills of wind, fire, and Thunder and successfully combined them.</p><p>Once it was successfully cultivated, the power was extremely terrifying. A spear thrust could penetrate everything and break everything.</p><p>He did not expect that there would be a scene of Lei Xu practicing his spear technique on the stone inscription. This was of great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look. A moment later, the world changed and Lu Ming was still in the abyss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
