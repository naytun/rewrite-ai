With a loud boom, the spear radiance exploded, and then, a turbulent force gushed forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s body cracked and turned into dust under the majestic attack of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>One move, just one move and a half-step King was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>More than half a year ago, during the war with the mystical sword sect, a half-step King was still an undefeatable existence to Lu Ming. He was high and mighty, and in the blazing sun Empire, he was a well-deserved tyrant.</p><p>But now, only a little more than half a year had passed and Lu Ming could kill a half-step King in one move. Who would believe it?</p><p>In the past six months, Lu Ming’s progress could be described as lightning fast.</p><p>The middle-aged man collapsed and disappeared into energy.</p><p>After that, the platform started to glow and a Black Vortex formed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped in.</p><p>After a moment of dizziness, Lu Ming realized that he was in a fighting ring after everything had settled down.</p><p>Several other directions of the fighting ring were blocked by a light curtain. Only the eastern side had a fan-shaped spectator stand, which was full of people.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Xiu’s eyes widened as he stared at the fighting ring below.</p><p>Then, his body began to tremble, and even his breathing became heavy.</p><p>“Hey, Lu Xiu, what’s wrong? Why are you shaking? Don’t tell me he’s suddenly possessed!”</p><p>An elder leader from a small district asked Lu Xiu in confusion.</p><p>no, I’m not scared. I’m scared because I saw another person pass the last stage in my cloud Emperor mountain range. I’m so excited!</p><p>Lu Xiu stuttered.</p><p>“It’s good that you’re fine!”</p><p>The elder in charge nodded. The next moment, he seemed to have realized something. His eyes widened and he looked at Lu Xiu in disbelief.”What? What did you just say? Another person from the cloud Emperor mountain range passed the last stage? You’re not joking, are you? How is that possible?”</p><p>His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>it’s true, it’s true. Although I’m also surprised, it’s true!</p><p>Lu Xiu said in a trembling voice. In fact, even he himself found it hard to believe.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s words naturally reached the ears of the people around him, but most of them shook their heads and were skeptical.</p><p>How could two people pass the last level in the small cloud Emperor mountain range? This had never happened before.</p><p>Occasionally, a person from a small area would pass through. That was still possible, as it had happened before in history.</p><p>It must be known that in most super large areas, only one person could pass through. Sometimes, no one could.</p><p>However, there was one exception, and that was the elder leading the team at the thousand River region, Zhao sui.</p><p>At this moment, his body was trembling slightly, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Others might not have seen Lu Ming but he had. Of course, he knew that Lu Ming was from the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>There were actually two people who had passed the last stage in the cloud Emperor mountain range, while only one or two people from the thousand River region had become the Emperor sky divine guards. Those geniuses who were ranked higher had all disappeared.</p><p>Comparing the two, the waters of the thousand River were too tragic to look at.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Zhao sui kept growling, his eyes red. He could not accept this fact.</p><p>The geniuses from the thousand River region had yet to appear. He knew that they had most likely fallen.</p><p>Jiang hongwen and Shangguan Yunyan, who were in the area of the Emperor sky divine guards, also widened their eyes.</p><p>“Lu Suan, Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming! He also passed the last level? How is this possible?”</p><p>Jiang hongwen shouted in disbelief.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes hard, thinking that he was seeing things. However, he almost rubbed his eyes until they bled. He was still looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming has become so powerful. No wonder Jian Fengyun is so nice to him. I’m so silly. I should have thought of this earlier.</p><p>Jiang hongwen muttered.</p><p>At the thought of how he had advised Lu Ming to hide far away from Qiu changkong before they entered the assessment venue, he felt his face burning.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were probably not much weaker than Qiu changkong’s. They might even be geniuses on the same level.</p><p>In particular, when he thought of how he did not treat Lu Ming well previously, he felt uneasy.</p><p>He wished that he could give himself a slap. If Lu Ming bore a grudge because of this, he would have a hard time in the future.</p><p>In the Ditian divine guards ‘area, Jian Fengyun smiled. He was not surprised that Lu Ming could pass the last level.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know what these people were thinking. He swept his gaze across and sized up his surroundings.</p><p>He discovered that there were already seven to eight figures on the platform.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you? You didn’t die?”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice with a hint of disbelief was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and a cold smile appeared on his face.</p><p>The person who spoke was zang Sheng from the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>At that moment, zang Sheng was looking at him with a face full of killing intent.</p><p>“If you’re not dead, how could I be?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s eyes flickered and he said coldly, ” good, very good. Although I don’t know what method you used to escape with your life, you shouldn’t have rushed here this time. Hehe, I hope you don’t run into me. Otherwise, I’ll suck all the blood in your body!</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m afraid you don’t have that ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a low growl came from the other side.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>Qiu changkong!</p><p>To be honest, Qiu changkong’s appearance here was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>it seems like it must be related to his master!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I really didn’t expect that not only did you not die in the eastern nether ancient battlefield, but you actually made it here. It’s really beyond my expectations!”</p><p>“But this is also good. It saves me the trouble of looking for your old ghost father, and I can directly take action on you!”</p><p>Qiu changkong glared at Lu Ming, his voice filled with killing intent.</p><p>alright, let’s settle our grudges this time!</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was also extremely strong.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Many powerful auras rose up and confronted each other.</p><p>The final battle had yet to begin, but Lu Ming and Qiu changkong were already sparring in the midst of death.</p><p>now, the battle hasn’t started yet. You’re not allowed to fight!</p><p>At this time, a majestic voice came from the sky. A figure had appeared in the sky without anyone knowing.</p><p>It was a middle-aged burly man with a monstrous aura. His aura was scorching hot. He stood in the void like a sun, burning the void until it distorted.</p><p>A terrifying and boundless pressure emanated from his body.</p><p>Countless people’s expressions changed drastically. This was definitely a King tier, and even among King tiers, he wasn’t weak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
