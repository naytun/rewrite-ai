Their blood and Qi were in turmoil and they almost vomited blood.</p><p>...</p><p>“What’s impossible? Just because you’ve never seen it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at them from above.</p><p>When Lu Ming had advanced the true war Dragon technique to the seventh stage, his combat strength had already surpassed that of a level five genius. After he had cultivated the heaven rank martial arts technique, his combat strength had completely entered that of a level six genius.</p><p>A heaven rank martial skill was too powerful, and it had a terrifying effect on increasing one’s combat power.</p><p>Heaven rank martial skills were extremely rare, yet they were unusually difficult to cultivate.</p><p>Many low-tier Kings didn’t even have a heaven rank martial skill, or they didn’t successfully cultivate it.</p><p>From this, one could see the rarity and power of heaven rank martial skills.</p><p>He was a level six fighter. Even if Lu Ming’s cultivation base was one level lower than that of burial, his combat strength was still half a level higher than his.</p><p>“That’s impossible. I’m the strongest. Lu Ming, you’re just an ant. An ant that has been living under my light.”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared. The power of lightning flashed all over his body, as if he was wearing a coat of lightning.</p><p>Having comprehended a trace of the will of thunder and lightning, he had already transcended the use of the power of Thunder and was about to completely control the thunder and lightning itself.</p><p>Once one completely comprehended the intent realm and condensed an intent rune, one would be able to completely control the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>If someone who comprehended the fire intent condensed a fire intent rune, then he could become the fire god and control all the flames in the world at will. If he comprehended the Thunder intent, he could control all the Thunder in the world. That was already the king realm, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>Qiu changkong had only comprehended a trace of the Thunder will, and he was still a long way from forming the Thunder rune.</p><p>“Kill! Lightning sword, sky-breaking!”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared as he unleashed his most powerful attack.</p><p>“Dragon devour, palm!”</p><p>Zang Sheng also sent a palm strike at Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s a pointless struggle. Qiu changkong, you said that you wanted me to see the difference between us. Now, open your dog eyes and see clearly!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard. The next moment, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Dragon God’s three absolutes, true dragon Strike!”</p><p>As the long spear stabbed out, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth surged crazily. A true dragon with green and red colors all over its body emerged.</p><p>The two-colored true dragon was over a hundred meters long. With a deafening roar, it pounced at Qiu changkong and zang Sheng.</p><p>The three absolutes of the Dragon God was cultivated with two forces. It was a true heaven-grade martial technique, and it was even stronger than the second step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two-colored true dragon collided with the attacks of the two.</p><p>In the sky, a blinding light shone. Then, the entire space trembled as if it was the end of the world.</p><p>After a while, when the blinding light dissipated, the crowd saw two figures falling down from the fighting ring like cannonballs.</p><p>It was the burial of life and Qiu changkong.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Like two toads, the two of them fell heavily on the fighting ring. The fighting ring rumbled and the two of them spat out blood.</p><p>However, the difference between the two of them could be seen.</p><p>Zang Sheng spat out a mouthful of blood and stood up in a hurry. His entire body was covered in a bloody glow as he stared at Lu Ming in the sky in shock.</p><p>Qiu changkong was half-kneeling on the ground. His body was trembling and blood was flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>His injuries were more serious than being buried.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, Do you understand now?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down at him.</p><p>“Ah …”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared in rage. He felt like he was going crazy. He felt boundless humiliation and he screamed madly,”Damn it, Lu Ming, you deserve to die. I’m going to kill you and destroy the mystical sword sect. I’m going to kill your parents with my own hands. Hahaha, you can’t fight against the power behind me.”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed maniacally.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply to Qiu changkong was a cold and emotionless ‘die’.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s entire body burst out with an incomparably cold killing intent, as if he had transformed into a god of death.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and took a step forward. The world rumbled.</p><p>“Block it! Dragon’s bite, fist!”</p><p>Zang Sheng roared, his palm turned into a fist, and he punched out twice in a row.</p><p>Qiu changkong roared as he slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A loud boom blocked Lu Ming’s first step, but Lu Ming took a second step.</p><p>Qiu changkong let out another blood-curdling screech as he was pressed to the ground by the powerful force. He spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s body slid a few hundred meters away, leaving a trail of blood in the fighting ring.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>However, before the two of them could catch their breath, Lu Ming took two consecutive steps forward.</p><p>This time, it was aimed at burial.</p><p>“Ah, I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Zang Sheng was finally afraid. He shouted in horror and tried his best to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps ‘power pressed zang Sheng down onto the platform, almost crushing him. A series of bone-cracking sounds rang out from his body, and it was unknown how many bones in his body had been broken.</p><p>The entire place was deathly silent.</p><p>Time and space seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>It was as if there was only one person left in the world, a young and handsome figure that floated in the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After a long while, the entire place burst into an earth-shattering uproar.</p><p>Oh my God, Lu Ming won. Lu Ming actually won.</p><p>furthermore, he won so easily. He’s too strong. Qiu changkong and zang Sheng were unable to fight back at all. He’s only at the peak of the 8th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>“Who said that he was just lucky? it’s not just his luck. It’s clearly the other people’s luck. If he had gone in early, Qiu changkong or burial would not have made it to the last round. They might have been swept by Lu Ming.”</p><p>I didn’t say that just now. On the contrary, I have always felt that Lu Ming must be a proud Son of Heaven who is blessed by the heavens since he can draw the bye card all the time. He is definitely extraordinary.</p><p>“Eh? No, I remember that you didn’t say that just now. You were certain that Lu Ming was just lucky and even mocked him.”</p><p>“Where? There’s absolutely no such thing. I’ve already seen that he’s a rare genius. How could I mock him? absolutely not.”</p><p>The scene was noisy, with shouts and arguments rising and falling.</p><p>It was as if this was the only way they could express the shock in their hearts.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and sucked. A huge amount of essential Qi was produced and the buried storage ring was sucked into his hand.</p><p>“No, you can’t be scared!”</p><p>Zang Sheng roared.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? You’ve lost. This is my trophy!” Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Burial. He had killed countless geniuses around the dragon’s cave. The storage rings of those geniuses had all fallen into his hands. Lu Ming could not forget this.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s eyes were red. There were endless resources in there. It was the capital that he had used to rise up. Now, all of them were taken advantage of by Lu Ming.</p><p>His heart was broken.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He moved and appeared in the sky above Qiu changkong. His eyes were cold and filled with killing intent as he looked at Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? I’m already injured, which means I’ve lost. You still dare to attack me?”</p><p>Qiu changkong sneered at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You lost? I didn’t hear you admit defeat. I’ve forgotten that you’ve just said that you’ll never admit defeat. If you do, you’ll be a joke.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … Even if I didn’t admit defeat, I’m injured. I’m seriously injured. Can’t you see? It’s the same as losing.”</p><p>Qiu changkong shouted. He wanted to admit defeat, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so.</p><p>“Injured, I’m not injured enough!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took a step forward.</p><p>“Ah, you … You …”</p><p>Qiu changkong howled in shock. He wanted to resist, but he was already heavily injured. How could he have the strength to do so?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>He followed in the footsteps of his death. He did not know how many bones in his armor had been broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Qiu changkong and zang Sheng had said that they would work together to break all of Lu Ming’s bones. Now, Lu Ming had broken all of their bones as he had wished.</p><p>”</p><p>Qiu changkong howled hysterically.</p><p>“Which part of the foul was it?”</p><p>A murderous look flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he condensed a long spear of essential Qi in his hand.</p><p>“No, I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Qiu changkong screamed madly. He could feel the killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes. Lu Ming was really going to kill him. He was going to ignore the rules and kill him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
