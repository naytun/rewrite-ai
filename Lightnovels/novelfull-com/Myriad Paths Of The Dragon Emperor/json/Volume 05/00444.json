We can’t let Lu Ming live. Master can’t do it, but we can. However, even if I do it now, I’m not 100% confident!”</p><p>...</p><p>The young man in purple muttered to himself.</p><p>“Then what should we do? Why don’t we invite the other senior brothers?”</p><p>Qiu changkong replied.</p><p>as for the other two senior brothers, one of them is traveling outside, and the other is in seclusion. Junior Brother, don’t worry. My cultivation has already reached the great circle realm, and I’ll be going into seclusion to break through to the martial King realm soon. When I break through to the martial King realm, I can kill Lu Ming with a flip of my hand!</p><p>The young man in purple said with a smile.</p><p>senior brother is about to break through to the martial King realm? ”</p><p>Qiu changkong was ecstatic.</p><p>that’s right. I’ve been stuck at the half-step King realm for many years. Now that I’ve reached my limit, it’s time to break through to the martial King realm!</p><p>The purple-robed youth said.</p><p>“How confident are you, senior brother?”</p><p>“80%!”</p><p>The young man in purple was very confident.</p><p>hahaha, that’s good. Let Lu Ming live for a little longer. When senior brother breaks through to the martial King realm, it will be the time of Lu Ming’s death!</p><p>Qiu changkong was ecstatic.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming was, he was no match for a martial King.</p><p>As long as the young man in purple broke through to the martial King realm and came out of his closed-door cultivation, he could simply find an excuse to challenge Lu Ming, and Lu Ming would be dead meat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can be arrogant all you want, but you won’t be able to be arrogant for long!”</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly laughed.</p><p>…</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was comprehending the power of wind and Fire every day.</p><p>But the progress was very small.</p><p>&Nbsp; after ‘force’ reached perfection, it was extremely difficult to comprehend intent from it.</p><p>Many people would be stuck at this step for their entire lives, unable to make any progress.</p><p>today, the palace master of the wind Palace will hold a lecture and personally explain the force and concept of wind. We can’t miss this!</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and left the courtyard, flying towards the wind Palace.</p><p>Every once in a while, the nine Hall Masters of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would personally give lessons and explain the force and intent realm of the related attributes.</p><p>It would attract a large number of Ditian divine guards to attend the lecture.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the entrance of the wind Palace, he noticed that there were other figures flying in his direction from other directions.</p><p>There was no one checking at the main entrance. Those who wanted to go in to listen could just go in directly.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the wind Palace and arrived at a large hall.</p><p>The main hall was extremely spacious. The floor of the main hall was filled with prayer mats.</p><p>There were at least tens of thousands of them.</p><p>At this moment, there were already over a thousand people sitting cross-legged on the futon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entrance attracted many people’s attention.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him. He found a futon at random and sat down. He closed his eyes and waited.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people increased.</p><p>Very quickly, it broke through two thousand people.</p><p>The majority of them were the Ditian divine guards who had just joined this year, while a portion of them were from the previous batch.</p><p>“Palace Master Feng is here!”</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and saw an old man in a green robe with a beautiful beard walking toward him. The old man looked to be in his sixties and had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>There was no trace of true essence fluctuation or powerful aura on his body.</p><p>Just like an ordinary person.</p><p>However, no one dared to show the slightest bit of contempt or disrespect.</p><p>It was said that the nine Palace Masters were all upper tier Kings.</p><p>Furthermore, he wasn’t an ordinary late stage King tier. His strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Greetings, Palace Master Feng!”</p><p>More than two thousand people stood up and bowed.</p><p>“No need to be so polite, please sit!”</p><p>Palace Master Feng smiled and waved his hand.</p><p>Everyone took their seats. Palace Master Feng also sat cross-legged on the high platform above the main hall.</p><p>today, all the people who have come are below the martial King realm and have comprehended the wind force. I’ll explain in detail how to comprehend a trace of wind concept from the wind force, and then how to use this trace of wind concept to finally condense an intent rune and pass the test of the heavenly Tribulation to reach the martial King realm!</p><p>Palace Master Feng’s voice rang out.</p><p>Everyone’s spirits were lifted. They had come here to hear this.</p><p>“To know all this, you must first clearly understand what force is. What is the intent realm?”</p><p>Palace Master Feng’s voice continued to ring out: ” momentum is actually a type of intent realm of the heaven and earth. However, it is a very superficial way of borrowing it. This is because every attribute will have momentum!</p><p>“Like water, when it’s gentle, it can nourish all things. This is also a kind of power of water. When it’s violent, it can destroy the earth. This is also a kind of power of water!”</p><p>like the wind. When it’s gentle, it’s like a clear wind. When it’s violent, it can tear everything apart. These are all the forces of the wind.</p><p>when you comprehend force, you’re actually just borrowing the intent realm of heaven and earth. It’s commonly known as borrowing force. Borrowing force can increase your own attack power, defense power, and so on!</p><p>As he said this, a powerful aura burst out from Palace Master Feng’s body. His aura suddenly became as majestic, heavy, and unattainable as an ancient divine mountain.</p><p>The next moment, his aura disappeared without a trace.</p><p>however, the essence realm of the heaven and earth is completely different from momentum. The essence realm of the heaven and earth is control. Control an attribute and use it to create all kinds of mysterious means!</p><p>After saying that, Palace Master Feng suddenly stretched out his palm. In his palm, there was a tornado that was spinning rapidly.</p><p>Although the tornado was small, Lu Ming could hear a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>Lu Ming had no doubt that as long as Palace Master Feng threw out this tornado, it would definitely be able to tear apart a mountain.</p><p>Then, Palace Master Feng moved his hand and the tornado disappeared. A blade of wind appeared on his finger. The blade of wind was like a blade, cutting through the space and causing the space to ripple like water.</p><p>One could see how terrifying this wind blade was.</p><p>of course, there are strong and weak when it comes to controlling an attribute. According to the degree of control, the essence realm of heaven and earth can be divided into many levels. Generally speaking, a martial King can only control a level one essence realm of heaven and earth!</p><p>…</p><p>Palace Master Feng explained the momentum of the wind and the creation of wind. Sometimes, he would even practice it himself.</p><p>Lu Ming listened attentively, for fear of missing every word and action.</p><p>All this while, Lu Ming had been comprehending and cultivating on his own. When did such an expert explain and practice in person?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he listened. Many of the questions that had troubled him for a long time were answered one by one. Lu Ming felt more and more relaxed. His mind was becoming more and more active. He felt extremely carefree.</p><p>He felt that his understanding of wind force had increased by a large margin.</p><p>The wind Palace master’s speech went on for three hours.</p><p>alright, today’s lecture ends here. Go back and comprehend it well. You’re all dismissed!</p><p>Palace Master Feng said.</p><p>Many people revealed reluctant expressions. They simply wanted to continue listening.</p><p>Lu Ming was the same.</p><p>At this moment, Palace Master Feng’s gaze swept toward Lu Ming and he said, ” “Lu Ming, wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He did not know why Palace Master Feng had stopped him.</p><p>The rest of the people around them looked at Lu Ming one after another, their eyes glimmering with curiosity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
