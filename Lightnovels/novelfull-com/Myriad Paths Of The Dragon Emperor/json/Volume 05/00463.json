I deserve to die. Please punish me, master!”</p><p>Xue Chao knelt on the ground, his body trembling.</p><p>The recovery ability of a King was extremely terrifying. In three days, Xue Chao’s injuries were almost completely healed. However, the side effects of the explosive Yuan pill weren’t so easy to heal. His face was still pale and his breathing was unstable.</p><p>Beside Xue Chao stood Qiu changkong, who was as silent as a cicada in winter.</p><p>The master of thunder Palace sat at the very top. His face was extremely gloomy, and his body emitted waves of killing intent. you are indeed a piece of trash. You are a King, yet you lost to a half-step King. You have lost all face for your master!</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s cold voice resounded. The killing intent from his body became even more intense, causing Xue Chao’s body to tremble even more.</p><p>The atmosphere in the hall was extremely oppressive.</p><p>After a while, Thunder Palace Master’s Voice sounded again, ” however, you can’t be blamed entirely. Lu Ming, that little b * stard’s talent is indeed rare in the world. He far surpasses the average genius. I was also shocked.</p><p>“Master, are we just going to let that b * stard Lu Ming off and let him continue to be so arrogant?”</p><p>Qiu changkong said unwillingly.</p><p>“Of course not. Lu Ming, that little b * stard, won’t live for long.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed eerily.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xue Chao’s eyes lit up. Qiu changkong hurriedly said, ” “Master, are you going to kill that b * stard Lu Ming personally?”</p><p>“Foolish!”</p><p>The palace Master of the Thunder Palace berated, causing Qiu changkong’s face to turn pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that little b * stard, is very smart. A few days ago, he sold the sword-shaped plant to old man Feng and the others at a low price. It looked like he suffered a loss, but in fact, he made a big profit. At the same time, he won the favor of the three Palace Masters. Now, those three old men are very fond of Lu Ming. If I do it myself, not only will I be a laughing stock, but the three old men will also make trouble for me. Why would I do such an unwise thing?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said.</p><p>“Master, how do you plan to deal with Lu Ming?”</p><p>Xue Chao asked carefully.</p><p>“It’s been some time since Lu Ming joined the Empyrean sky divine guards. Everyone who has joined the Empyrean sky divine guards for a period of time must complete a mission for the Empyrean sky divine Palace. This is the responsibility of every Empyrean sky Divine Guard.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master slowly said.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xue Chao’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Master, are you planning to tamper with the mission this time?”</p><p>Xue Chao asked.</p><p>“Hehe, that’s right. When the time comes, I will arrange a special mission for Lu Ming. As long as he dies during this mission, no one will suspect him. Even if they suspect him, they have no reason to find trouble with me.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed coldly.</p><p>“Master is wise!”</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xue Chao were overjoyed. They bowed deeply to the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>“Yes, Zhangkong. I know that you have an old grudge with Lu Ming. The matter in your hometown, the blazing sun Empire, has yet to be completely resolved. After Lu Ming has accepted the mission, you should return to the blazing sun Empire and settle the matter there. Chao ‘er, go with Zhangkong and assist him.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master ordered.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was naturally overjoyed, and he bowed to the Thunder Palace Master to express his gratitude.</p><p>However, in the next moment, he revealed a worried expression and said, ” “Master, Lu Ming is a lucky guy. He can always turn danger into safety. I’m just worried that if he’s lucky enough to survive and finds out that I’ve returned to the blazing sun Empire to deal with his friends and family, he’ll go straight to the blazing sun Empire to kill …”</p><p>Now, Qiu changkong was terrified of Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming did not die and he knew that he had gone back to deal with his family, he would really be finished.</p><p>A look of disappointment flashed across the palace master of thunder Palace’s eyes when he saw Qiu changkong’s cowardly appearance. He snorted coldly.”Are you doubting your master’s arrangements?”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s expression changed drastically. He hurriedly knelt down and said, ” “Your disciple doesn’t dare, your disciple doesn’t dare.”</p><p>“Alright, let me tell you. I’ve already arranged everything perfectly. While Lu Ming is carrying out his mission, I’ll think of a way to let him know that you’ve returned to the burning sun Empire to deal with his family. If he’s lucky enough to survive and return to the burning sun Empire, he’ll be dead for sure.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed complacently.</p><p>“It turns out that master had already made arrangements. This disciple was overthinking. Master’s strategic planning, this disciple admires.”</p><p>Qiu changkong was overjoyed, and he immediately began to flatter the man.</p><p>haha, alright, just wait for the news. As long as Lu Ming accepts the mission and sets off, you can set off too.</p><p>Thunder Palace Master laughed complacently.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming was still continuously tempering his essential core.</p><p>It had already been seven days. This time, Lu Ming had been tempering for seven days.</p><p>In seven days, Lu Ming had used up a total of 50000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>After spending 50000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals, Lu Ming had finally converted his vital essence to 99%. In his body, 99% was vital essence and only 1% was essential Qi.</p><p>However, no matter how much Lu Ming tempered the last one percent, there was no effect at all.</p><p>as expected, I need to break through to the martial King realm before my Zhen Yuan can reach 100% completion.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Those below the martial King realm could not even temper their true Yuan to 100%.</p><p>Although it was only a difference of one percent, the difference in power was huge.</p><p>100% represented perfection. It was as smooth as one, and there was no obstruction in its operation.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent meant that there were impurities, and the circulation and explosion of true Yuan would not be smooth. There would be obstacles.</p><p>now, as long as I can condense an intent rune from one intent, I can break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>As long as he could break through one of the three concepts, Lu Ming would be able to step into the martial King realm.</p><p>After reaching the martial King realm, it would be easier to cultivate the other two intents.</p><p>let’s start with the Thunder concept first!</p><p>Ever since the lightning cauldron flew into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, he felt as if he was bathing in the ocean of the lightning concept. He was constantly gaining new understanding of the lightning concept.</p><p>The Thunder concept had simply advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Now, among the three concepts of wind, fire, and Thunder, the Thunder concept had become the concept that Lu Ming had the deepest understanding of.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and his consciousness appeared in his sea of consciousness. He looked at the huge lightning cauldron.</p><p>The lightning cauldron had not been moving at all during this period of time. It was only constantly emitting a powerful lightning concept.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately began to comprehend.</p><p>His comprehension of the Thunder concept continued to deepen, and he was getting closer and closer to being able to form concept runes.</p><p>As long as one comprehended a certain intent to a certain extent, one could materialize this intent and condense it into an intent rune.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another eight days passed.</p><p>Half a month had already passed since he challenged Xue Chao.</p><p>On this day, a Deacon came to the eastern sky courtyard. The inscriptions in the courtyard responded. Lu Ming opened his eyes from his cultivation.</p><p>Then, he walked out of the eastern heaven courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m the deacon of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace’s Mission Hall. You’ve been in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace for some time now. You must complete a mission for the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.”</p><p>The deacon of the hall of mission said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
