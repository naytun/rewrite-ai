It soared into the sky like a smoke signal, and his body was covered with powerful true Qi. This true Qi was flowing like liquid.</p><p>...</p><p>such terrifying true Qi! This is the peak of martial ancestor realm level 9!</p><p>zang Sheng has actually reached the peak of the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm. It’s terrifying. It seems like no one is his match.</p><p>perhaps only Qiu changkong, who has comprehended a sliver of intent realm, has a chance!</p><p>Burial’s all-out outburst caused a clamor in the audience, shocking countless people.</p><p>Before this, zang Sheng had not used his full power, so no one knew his true cultivation level. Now that he had used his full power, it was shocking.</p><p>Song Yan’s eyes also revealed a serious look.</p><p>“Blade of the vast expanse!”</p><p>Song Yan shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above his head, 18 huge sabers appeared. The saber’s body was engraved with vast mountains, which was extremely wonderful.</p><p>Moreover, the blade was surrounded by six Meridian cycles.</p><p>This was Song Yan’s bloodline, a special bloodline.</p><p>“So what if he has a special bloodline? Come out, Blood Dragon!”</p><p>Zang Sheng let out a low roar and a blood-red light exploded above his head. A huge blood-red flood Dragon appeared.</p><p>It was also a sixth level King bloodline.</p><p>Their bloodlines exploded, raising their auras to the peak.</p><p>However, it was obvious that the power of the burial was stronger. Wave after wave of aura pressed towards Song Yan.</p><p>Song Yan’s expression changed and he shouted, ” “Vast mountain cleaving!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A dazzling blade light burst out from Song Yan’s hand. It was a hundred meters long and ten meters wide. It was crystal clear and bright as it slashed towards zang Sheng.</p><p>“An empty shell!”</p><p>Zang Sheng snorted coldly and shot up into the air. His claws were like the claws of a Blood Dragon. As he swiped out with his claws, the space rumbled and he instantly pierced through the space, grabbing onto the saber Light.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>break! zang Sheng shouted as he clenched his fist, shattering the blade light like glass.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, zang Sheng’s figure flickered as he pounced towards Song Yan, appearing in front of him in an instant.</p><p>Song Yan’s expression changed drastically. He didn’t expect that his full-force attack would be so easily countered by zang Sheng.</p><p>“Vast earth shattering Strike!”</p><p>Song Yan roared as he waved his saber. A mountain appeared above his head and in front of him.</p><p>The two mountains were filled with a vast and desolate Qi. One was used to protect the body, while the other was used to suppress zang Sheng.</p><p>“Dragon devour, point!”</p><p>die! zang Sheng shouted coldly as he transformed his claws into fingers. His fingers glowed with a pitch-black Luster as he thrust them towards the two mountains.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two mountains exploded like balloons on zang Sheng’s fingers.</p><p>The finger force didn’t stop as it struck towards Song Yan.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At the crucial stone carving, Song Yan used his saber to block in front of him. With a clang, his body was sent flying like a cannonball, and he coughed up a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Song Yan is going to lose!”</p><p>isn’t this a little too fast? we’ve only exchanged a few moves, so how can burial be so strong? ”</p><p>he’s surpassed a battle genius. Burial has definitely surpassed a battle genius. He’s between a battle genius and a battle genius.</p><p>terrifying, too terrifying. There’s actually someone who can surpass the genius of four battles.</p><p>Everyone in the audience was shocked.</p><p>The most powerful warriors in each super region were usually four battle geniuses. Four battle geniuses were the limit. Those who surpassed four battle geniuses were extremely rare. Each of them was a rare genius.</p><p>To think that burial had actually reached such a level. It was truly terrifying!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Zang Sheng had the upper hand, and his attacks were like a storm, pouring down on Song Yan.</p><p>“Dragon devour, palm!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, zang Sheng’s fingers turned into a palm, and he struck out towards Song Yan.</p><p>This time, Song Yan was even more miserable. Although he tried his best to resist, he was still sent flying. He slid along the fighting ring for hundreds of meters, and blood sprayed all over the ground.</p><p>“I surrender, I admit defeat!”</p><p>As soon as he caught his breath, Song Yan started to scream madly.</p><p>There was no need to fight anymore. Song Yan knew that he was no match for zang Sheng. Not only was his cultivation base behind, but his ability to fight above his level was also behind. If he continued to fight, he would only be looking for a beating.</p><p>“Hmph, why didn’t you admit defeat earlier? you really won’t shed tears until you see the coffin.”</p><p>Zang Sheng coldly snorted, incomparably disdainful.</p><p>Song Yan’s expression was ugly. He struggled to get up and walked to the side of the fighting ring.</p><p>Qiu changkong looked at zang Sheng with a grave expression, his brows furrowed.</p><p>next round, No. 2, Qiu changkong, versus No. 3, Xuan Feng!</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two figures flashed and appeared in the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xuan Feng both carried their swords on their backs and stood tall.</p><p>Xuan Feng, you’re no match for me. Just admit defeat. My opponent is zang Sheng. There’s no need for you to struggle.</p><p>Qiu changkong spoke.</p><p>“You didn’t even fight, who knew you would win?”</p><p>Xuan Feng’s eyes were as sharp as swords. He waved his hand and a combat sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>putting up a stubborn resistance. If you don’t know what you’re doing, then you’ll be defeated!</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly spoke as his sword Qi soared up into the sky.</p><p>The two dazzling sword lights collided with a loud bang.</p><p>Qiu changkong had comprehended the force of Thunder and had even comprehended a trace of intent realm, while Xuan Feng had comprehended the force of gold. Both of their attacks were extremely overbearing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Everyone could only see two sword lights clashing in the air at an extreme speed, and in an instant, they had collided more than ten times.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a figure flew back quickly and stopped at the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>It was Xuan Feng.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xuan Feng’s body suddenly trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. At this moment, everyone saw a deep sword wound on his chest. It was so deep that his bones could be seen, but not a drop of blood flowed out.</p><p>That was because the area around the wound was filled with the power of lightning. The blood that flowed out was evaporated by the power of lightning.</p><p>Xuan Feng, if it was a life-and-death battle, you would have been dead!</p><p>Qiu changkong looked at Xuan Feng arrogantly.</p><p>“I’ve lost!”</p><p>Xuan Feng sighed and did not say anything more.</p><p>Although Xuan Feng’s cultivation was slightly higher than Qiu changkong’s, Qiu changkong had already comprehended a trace of Thunder will. The gap was too great to make up for. Xuan Feng was no match for him at all.</p><p>With Xuan Feng’s defeat, the crowd burst into a heated discussion.</p><p>the top two are Qiu changkong and zang Sheng. The eastern sky divine guards must be between these two.</p><p>“Top two? Aren’t they the top three?”</p><p>“Top three? Lu Ming, forget it. I’ve relied on luck to get to this point. It’ll be good enough if I can block Qiu changkong and burial’s move later.”</p><p>“That’s true!”</p><p>did you guys notice that none of the top three are from the Super regions? this is really rare.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah!”</p><p>“Old Lu, I didn’t expect that two people from your cloud Emperor mountain range would make it into the top three. Although one of them made it by luck, I still have to congratulate you.”</p><p>Someone from the elders ‘area congratulated Lu Xiu.</p><p>“I was lucky, I was lucky!”</p><p>Lu Xiu was already grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Zhao sui’s eyes were red with jealousy.</p><p>Qiu changkong is the winner of this round. The top three have been decided. The three of you will take turns to fight each other. The winner will be the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
