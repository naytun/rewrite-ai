Buzzzzzz!</p><p>...</p><p>The sound of the air being torn apart rang out as figures appeared outside these altars.</p><p>Each direction of the eastern nether ancient battlefield corresponded to a sacrificial altar.</p><p>All the geniuses of the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region were scattered in these four directions.</p><p>Lu Ming was in the East.</p><p>At the altar in the Eastern Region, figures flickered and young men with powerful auras appeared.</p><p>A few hours later, more than 3000 people had gathered, and the number was still increasing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two rays of sword radiance appeared outside the altar. When the sword radiance dissipated, two figures were revealed. They were Jian Fengyun and Xiao Haoyu.</p><p>Their auras were powerful, clearly much stronger than they were two months ago.</p><p>“Brother Jian!”</p><p>As soon as Jian Fengyun appeared, someone in the crowd flew over to greet him.</p><p>“Brother Jiang!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun smiled.</p><p>This person was Jiang hongwen, who was ranked third on the cloud Emperor board.</p><p>In addition, there were also some familiar faces on the cloud Emperor board, such as Su Yingying, who was ranked 13th.</p><p>Liu Xiaofeng, who was ranked 35th.</p><p>When they first entered the eastern nether ancient battlefield, not everyone had gathered together.</p><p>Most of the people were gathered together, but there were still some people who were scattered far away after being teleported in.</p><p>Jiang hongwen and the others were the same.</p><p>Jian Fengyun greeted them with a nod.</p><p>The number of people kept increasing, and soon, it had exceeded five thousand.</p><p>guys, look! That’s the genius from the Super District, Fengyun Bay!</p><p>the geniuses from white feather city are here too. That’s also a super region!</p><p>Around them, people kept exclaiming in shock.</p><p>This was because the geniuses from the superior super regions had all appeared.</p><p>“Look, what’s that? A blood-red Cloud?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed into the distance and shouted.</p><p>In the distance, a mass of blood-red clouds surged over. As it approached, the cloud dispersed, revealing more than a hundred figures inside.</p><p>The leader was zang Sheng, the blood-robed young man from the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>The others were the hundred over young experts from the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>“Hehe! A bunch of trash!”</p><p>Zang Sheng looked at the geniuses from the Super regions and laughed in disdain.</p><p>He did not hold back his voice at all, and it spread far and wide.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>In the Fengyun Bay Area, a genius roared angrily. His killing intent flashed as his body moved and he pounced forward like a corpse.</p><p>His aura was as heavy as a mountain. This was a genius expert who had reached the early stage of martial ancestor 8-dan.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, zang Sheng’s figure flickered, like a Phantom. In the next moment, a mournful scream rang out.</p><p>Everyone was shocked to see that zang Sheng’s claw was on the head of the young man from Fengyun Bay, and five holes were made in his head.</p><p>The body of the young man from Fengyun Bay wriggled rapidly. In a few breaths, he turned into a dry corpse. All the blood Qi essence in his body had disappeared.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>Gasps could be heard as everyone looked at burial in shock.</p><p>This was a genius in the early stage of the martial ancestor 8-dan. Moreover, he was most likely a genius who had won three battles. However, in the hands of Buried Life, he was as weak as a little chick and had no power to resist.</p><p>How strong was burial?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Powerful auras burst out from the Fengyun Bay Area. Hundreds of young men stared at zang Sheng with gloomy eyes.</p><p>One of them, in particular, had an especially powerful aura that was extremely terrifying.</p><p>He was wearing a wind cloud robe and stepped out. He stared at zang Sheng with an unfriendly gaze and said, ” “Friend, isn’t this too much?”</p><p>“He’s the Aeolus sect, the most powerful person in the Fengyun Bay Area!”</p><p>Someone recognized the young man.</p><p>“Too much? He’s just a piece of trash. Is it wrong for me to say that? If you want to attack me, you’re just courting death. What, you want to attack too? I don’t mind sending you on your way to accompany him!”</p><p>Zang Sheng laughed in disdain and licked his lips. His eyes were cold and greedy as he looked at the Aeolus sect.</p><p>Savage, he was completely Savage. Even when facing the strongest person in a super region, he was still extremely Savage.</p><p>The Aeolus sect leader frowned.</p><p>For some reason, being stared at by zang Sheng, Aeolus sect felt a chill run down his spine. His hair stood on end as if he was being stared at by an extremely venomous snake.</p><p>“Where are you guys from?”</p><p>The Aeolus sect asked.</p><p>“Hehe, you want to know? There’s no harm in telling you, we’re from the Dragon burial abyss!”</p><p>Zang Sheng sneered.</p><p>“Dragon burial abyss?”</p><p>The Aeolus sect leader’s eyes flashed and he was a little surprised. He then said,”Alright, I’ll remember this!”</p><p>The Aeolus sect had retreated, causing an uproar among the onlookers.</p><p>Clearly, the Aeolus sect did not make a move. They were planning to retreat.</p><p>Wasn’t the Dragon burial abyss an ordinary large area? How could there be such a terrifying genius? Could it make the Aeolus sect retreat?</p><p>Everyone looked at zang Sheng with great curiosity.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Zang Sheng laughed in disdain.</p><p>At this moment, more and more people were gathering, and there were already more than 10000 people.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, a bolt of lightning flashed, and a figure appeared.</p><p>Qiu changkong!</p><p>The people from the Cloud King Mountain range exclaimed when they saw Qiu changkong.</p><p>The moment Qiu changkong appeared, he scanned his surroundings and saw Jian Fengyun and the others.</p><p>He took a step forward and arrived in front of Jian Fengyun and the others. He looked around and said coldly, ” “Where’s Lu Ming? Where did he go? could he be dead? Do any of you have any news about him?”</p><p>His tone was overbearing and commanding. It didn’t sound like a question, but more like he was ordering Jian Fengyun and the others to speak.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, Jiang hongwen, and the others frowned.</p><p>They were all geniuses, so they were naturally displeased with Qiu changkong’s tone.</p><p>brother Lu is a peerless talent. Naturally, he won’t die. He’s most likely on his way here!</p><p>Jian Feng Yun said.</p><p>“Brother Lu? It seems that you have been with Lu Ming all this while. Tell me, where is Lu Ming? send him a message and tell him to come over and die!”</p><p>Qiu changkong continued to command.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, mind your attitude. Even if I knew, why should I tell you?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s voice turned cold.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you unhappy? Haha, Jian Fengyun, do you still think that you are the number one genius on the cloud Emperor board? I’m telling you, in front of me, you’re just a piece of trash. Now, kneel down!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was incomparably arrogant as he sent a palm flying toward Jian Fengyun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out as Jian Fengyun unsheathed his longsword. A streak of sword Qi shot up into the sky. It was terrifying.</p><p>The early phase of the martial ancestor realm level 8. It was obvious that Jian Fengyun had also made a breakthrough during this period of time. He had reached the early phase of the martial ancestor realm level 8.</p><p>Qiu changkong, you may have had a fortuitous encounter and your cultivation base has improved greatly, but you’re too arrogant. Let me see how much progress you’ve made!</p><p>Jian Fengyun said in a deep voice.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, an extremely sharp sword Qi slashed toward Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Supercilious? Why do I need to look at you guys in the eye?”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed coldly. He suddenly pointed his fingers together like a sword, and a bolt of sword Qi with lightning flashing around it burst forth.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>With a crisp sound, Jian Fengyun’s sword Qi was shattered. Qiu changkong’s lightning sword Qi continued on its way to Jian Fengyun’s throat.</p><p>The speed was so fast that it was beyond human reaction time.</p><p>Jian Fengyun wanted to avoid it, but it was too late.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
