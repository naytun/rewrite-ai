Otherwise, the Lu clan would not be where it was today.</p><p>The stronger the Lu clan was, the more they would benefit.</p><p>Now, as branch Masters, their authority was even greater than that of the castellans of major cities. The castellans of major cities had to listen to them, which made them extremely happy. Naturally, they were even more respectful to Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and the others.</p><p>The group of them arrived at the Lu family’s courtyard. Dozens of tables were already filled with banquets, and the group invited Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping to the topmost table.</p><p>everyone, thank you for coming. I haven’t been back for many years. Now, I’d like to propose a toast to everyone!</p><p>Lu Yuntian raised his wine cup and said loudly.</p><p>Back then, Lu Yuntian was rather famous in many large cities. There were many old friends of his present.</p><p>“Brother Yuntian, it’s been so many years. I didn’t expect that we would meet again!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>Looking in the direction of the voice, Lu Yuntian’s eyes lit up. He smiled and said,”Brother Zhou, haha, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming also looked over, a smile on his face.</p><p>The person who had just spoken was Zhou Linshan.</p><p>Lu Ming could still clearly remember that he had met Zhou Linshan on his first mission after joining the mystical sword sect. It was also from Zhou Linshan that he learned that Lu Yuntian was still alive.</p><p>“Uncle Zhou, please take a seat!”</p><p>Lu Ming also stood up and cupped his fists.</p><p>champion King, you don’t have to be so polite. I wouldn’t dare to accept such a title!</p><p>Zhou Linshan waved his hand.</p><p>In his heart, however, he was extremely complicated and sighed.</p><p>When he had first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming was only a young fellow at the master realm. In just a few years, Lu Ming had actually become a King tier whose name shook the world.</p><p>That was a King tier! Just thinking about this word made his heart tremble.</p><p>brother Zhou, you’re welcome. Come on!</p><p>Lu Yuntian waved his hand.</p><p>Back then, the fact that Lu Yuntian had entrusted the Heavenly Star sword and two other important items to Zhou Linshan was proof of their relationship.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Yuntian was extremely happy to see an old friend.</p><p>At this moment, Zhou Linshan no longer declined and walked toward Lu Ming and the rest’s seats.</p><p>haha, brother Zhou, it’s been years since we last met. You and I have both grown old. Come, let’s drink three big bowls first!</p><p>Lu Yuntian laughed heartily. He no longer used a cup but a large bowl, filling two bowls with wine.</p><p>“Haha, good!”</p><p>Infected by Lu Yuntian’s heroic spirit, Zhou Linshan let loose as well. He laughed heartily and drank three bowls of wine with Lu Yuntian.</p><p>The city Lords and family heads looked at Zhou Linshan with envy.</p><p>Zhou Linshan had such a good relationship with the Lu family? What an honor it was to be able to sit at the same table as Lu Ming and Lu Yuntian!</p><p>Many people even thought that they should build a good relationship with Zhou Linshan in the future.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming also toasted Zhou Linshan.</p><p>After three rounds of drinking, Lu Ming, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping left.</p><p>The others continued to drink.</p><p>In the next few days, there were people who came to the Lu family to congratulate him. Lu Ming did not meet any of them and focused on cultivation.</p><p>As for Lu Yuntian, he would meet some of his acquaintances.</p><p>As time passed slowly, Lu Ming’s understanding of the intent realm became deeper and deeper.</p><p>However, the Wind and Fire intents were still far from being able to condense intent runes.</p><p>On the other hand, his Thunder mentality was improving rapidly every day because of the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>On the other hand, the Dragon God’s three absolutes had also completely stabilized at the third level.</p><p>However, if he wanted to cultivate to the fourth level, he had to condense intent runes from all three types of intents.</p><p>Very quickly, more than ten days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, the people of the Lu clan were already preparing to set off for the Imperial City.</p><p>The Lu family was an important guest this time.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had brought Li Ping and Lu Yuntian to the imperial capital earlier than them.</p><p>On his second day in the imperial capital, Lu Ming went to the general Star Hall and walked towards the earth cave.</p><p>During this period of time, the general Star Hall had already started operating again. The students who had not died in the past had all returned to the general Star Hall.</p><p>The only thing that Lu Ming was curious about in the blazing sun Empire was the earth Aeon cave.</p><p>There were 13 levels in the earth cave, and it was said that it was opened by the king of the imperial family. It was said that only the King could enter the 12th and 13th levels.</p><p>Moreover, there was another saying that the thirteenth level of the royal family wasn’t the limit. Because, because with that King’s strength, he could only open the thirteenth level. After that, even the king couldn’t do it.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the entrance of the earth cave.</p><p>“Lu … No, the champion …”</p><p>The few burly men at the gate were shocked to see Lu Ming. They stammered for a long time but could not complete a sentence.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked in.</p><p>At this time, the few burly men guarding the door finally reacted.</p><p>“Who is that, nest? He actually walked in just like that. He seems pretty arrogant.”</p><p>Around them, there were other young men. A young man with an arrogant face said with some dissatisfaction.</p><p>“You must be f * cking blind. That’s Lu Ming, the champion King. You don’t know him? You’re a new student who just joined not long ago?”</p><p>On the side, someone looked at him in disdain.</p><p>“What? That was Lu Ming. No, that was the champion? My idol, my idol, why didn’t you say so earlier? Oh my God, I missed my idol just like that. No, I’m going to wait for him here.”</p><p>The arrogance on the young man’s face disappeared and was replaced by admiration.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s arrival in the earth cave spread throughout the general Star Hall in an instant. Countless people surrounded the earth cave. Some young men who were in closed-door cultivation hurriedly ended their cultivation and rushed to the earth cave after receiving the news.</p><p>Most of them were girls.</p><p>Lu Ming, who had reached the martial King realm before the age of twenty, was unprecedented in the history of the 36 countries of Emperor Yun, let alone the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>Young girls all admired heroes and were fond of geniuses. Lu Ming was such a peerless genius. Naturally, countless young girls would admire and like him.</p><p>Countless people were waiting outside the earth cave.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not know that he had caused such a huge sensation. He went all the way down without stopping.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the ninth level.</p><p>At this point, the fire spiritual Qi was extremely rich and violent.</p><p>Ordinary people couldn’t cultivate here at all, as their meridians would be burned by the violent fire spiritual Qi.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, this bit of fiery spiritual energy was like a Buddha’s face in the spring breeze. He did not feel anything.</p><p>He continued down.</p><p>When he arrived at the 10th floor, he felt that the fire spiritual Qi there was several times denser and more violent than the 9th floor.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and continued to go down.</p><p>Level 11, level 12.</p><p>When Lu Ming reached the twelfth floor, his expression changed slightly.</p><p>The fire spiritual Qi here had already reached an exaggerated level.</p><p>The endless fire spiritual Qi was extremely violent and ravaged wantonly.</p><p>The surrounding walls had completely turned into crystals and were extremely hard.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even a half-step King would be killed by the fire spiritual Qi if he cultivated here.</p><p>Only a King could come here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
