It’s still early. When the geniuses of the thousand River region appear, you’ll be scared to death!”</p><p>“Oh? Then I’ll wait!”</p><p>Lu Xiu laughed.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people who appeared in the reserve Emperor sky Divine Guard area gradually increased.</p><p>However, Zhao sui’s expression became more and more unsightly.</p><p>There were only a few people from the thousand River region, which was not much better than the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>haha, Zhao sui, there are so many of you. You really scared me to death.</p><p>Lu Xiu said sarcastically.</p><p>In the past, Zhao sui had laughed at him from time to time. Now that he had the chance, Lu Xiu naturally retaliated.</p><p>“Why are you so anxious?”</p><p>Zhao sui said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Oh? Zhao sui, it’s almost time for the assessment to be completed, but I haven’t seen many people. Do you really think that all the geniuses from your thousand River region can become real Ditian divine guards?”</p><p>Lu Xiu sneered.</p><p>Giggle</p><p>Zhao sui gritted his teeth.</p><p>However, he was also very anxious.</p><p>He knew very well that there were only a dozen or so people in the thousand River region who could challenge the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>There were still 40 to 50 people who could attempt to become the reserve empyrean heaven divine guards.</p><p>But now, there were quite a few people who were eliminated, but they were all just bystanders.</p><p>However, there were only a few of them who could make it to the Emperor sky Divine Guard reserve.</p><p>He was a little flustered, afraid that something would happen.</p><p>Han Xun, the leader of the nether demon Palace, also had an ugly expression on his face. This was because the situation of the nether demon Palace was the same as the thousand River waters. There were only a few who were ready to become the Emperor sky divine guards.</p><p>At the place of the assessment, on the thousand-step Jade staircase.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and walked toward the stone door.</p><p>As soon as he entered, the environment changed again, and he found himself on a platform.</p><p>In front of him was a middle-aged man with a long spear on his back. He stood there like a Straight Mountain.</p><p>“You … As long as you can defeat me, you’ll be able to become an Emperor sky Divine Guard.”</p><p>The middle-aged man said, his voice cold and emotionless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell that this burly man was formed by inscriptions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the middle-aged man finished speaking, a powerful aura exploded from his body.</p><p>“Peak of the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He sighed inwardly at the difficulty of the Ditian Divine Guard examination.</p><p>In order to defeat an ordinary 9th level martial ancestor realm expert, one’s cultivation had to be at the peak of the 7th level martial ancestor realm. One’s combat strength had to surpass a World War 2 expert.</p><p>Of course, if he was a three or four battle genius, then his cultivation could be lower.</p><p>in the cloud Emperor mountain range, only Jian Fengyun can achieve such a level of difficulty!</p><p>Young master Tian she was already dead. Jiang hongwen’s cultivation had not reached the peak of the seventh level of martial ancestor realm, so he basically had no chance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the middle-aged burly man bellowed and became one with his spear. The long spear in his hand turned into a bolt of lightning and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He quickly condensed a long spear in his hand and thrust it out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>This spear attack was more than twice as fast as the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear pierced through the middle-aged man’s chest. The middle-aged man’s entire body exploded and dissipated into energy.</p><p>A martial arts Grandmaster 9-dan peak was dealt with in one move.</p><p>To the current Lu Ming, this was not difficult at all.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked forward.</p><p>In front of the platform was another stone door, and on the left was a vortex.</p><p>As long as they gave up on the challenge, they would be able to leave the vortex and become the Ditian divine guards.</p><p>Entering through the stone door meant continuing the challenge.</p><p>If the challenge was successful, the Challenger would appear on the fighting ring on the first level of the huge building in the myriad Star City.</p><p>There, the battle of the strongest would take place and the four divine guards would be decided.</p><p>Since Lu Ming and the others were in the Eastern Region, they were naturally the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>The building was divided into four parts, north, south, east and west, representing the four Heavenly Divine guards.</p><p>Becoming one of the four divine guards could be said to be the strongest expert among the younger generation in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region. There were many benefits, and they were also the biggest focus of the event. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many people in that building.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped through the stone door without any hesitation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook. Lu Ming found himself in a secret room.</p><p>There were more than a dozen stone carvings on the walls of the secret room. Each stone carving was a person practicing martial arts.</p><p>This was a martial technique.</p><p>Other than that, there was nothing else.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a flash of light, and the figure of an old man condensed.</p><p>welcome to the challenge. This round is to test your comprehension ability. Everyone will appear in a secret room, but the test will be different for each person. There will be a martial technique that you are not good at, and you will be able to comprehend it. As long as you can successfully cultivate it within half an hour, you will pass this round!</p><p>The moment the old man appeared, he immediately started explaining.</p><p>“A fist technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Fist techniques were indeed his weakness.</p><p>Other than the low-level fist technique he had practiced in the beginning, he had not practiced any more fist techniques.</p><p>this fist technique is a black grade high level fist technique. You only need to cultivate to the first level within half an hour, the first glimpse of the door seal. Begin now!</p><p>After the old man finished speaking, his figure disappeared.</p><p>It was not easy to cultivate a black grade high level martial arts technique that he was not good at to the first stage within half an hour.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming began to study the stone carvings in detail and began to comprehend them.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>In the outside world, in the huge building of the myriad stars city.</p><p>“Someone has become a Ditian Divine Guard!”</p><p>Suddenly, a light flashed in the Ditian divine guards ‘area, and a figure appeared.</p><p>“Haha, it’s a genius from our Jin kui region!”</p><p>An elder leader laughed out loud.</p><p>The jinkui region was a small region, and having one person become an empyrean heaven Divine Guard was already breaking even. If there was one more person, it would be a breakthrough.</p><p>Moreover, he was the first to become an Empyrean sky Divine Guard.</p><p>Although being the first to become an Ditian Divine Guard didn’t mean that one’s strength was stronger than the others, there might be some people who wanted to challenge the next trials.</p><p>As more and more people became Ditian divine guards, more and more people became Ditian divine guards.</p><p>“Sword wind cloud!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Xiu’s eyes lit up. He saw Jian Fengyun in the Ditian divine guards ‘area.</p><p>“Hahaha, you didn’t let me down!”</p><p>Lu Xiu laughed heartily.</p><p>He was well aware of the strength of the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>Jian Fengyun still had a very high chance of becoming an Emperor sky Divine Guard.</p><p>As for young master Tian she and Jiang Hong Wen, it could only be said that there was hope, but not much hope.</p><p>Now that Jian Fengyun had become an Emperor sky Divine Guard, he could finally relax.</p><p>No matter how weak they were, at least one of them had become an empyrean heaven Divine Guard.</p><p>One had to know that in the cloud Emperor mountain range, no one had become an Emperor sky Divine Guard in the previous tournament.</p><p>If one of them became a Ditian Divine Guard, he would still be able to obtain some rewards.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
