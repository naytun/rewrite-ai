Rays of saber radiance split the iron chains apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>There were also five chains that wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and formed many long Spears. They flew in all directions to block the chains.</p><p>At the same time, his true energy burst forth, and his body was about to soar into the sky. However, the moment his body moved, a piercing pain came from his chest.</p><p>The bald man’s sudden attack had caught him off guard.</p><p>The bald burly man had sneered at Lu Ming the moment they met. This made Lu Ming let his guard down. Now that he thought about it, he did it on purpose.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and forced his way up.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The bald burly man bellowed. He held the saber with both hands and a blazing saber gleam slashed violently at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked the attack with his long spear, but his body could not help but fall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>More than ten iron chains danced in the air and wrapped around the bald man and Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a dozen more iron chains rushed out of the deep pit.</p><p>Lu Ming resisted with all his might but in the end, he was still entangled by a metal chain.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, just die obediently!”</p><p>The bald man laughed.</p><p>“Let’s come down together!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. With a wave of his hand, seven to eight spear lights shot toward the bald man. At the same time, he reached out and grabbed an iron chain. With a sudden swing, the iron chain fused with three wills and shot toward the bald man.</p><p>The bald burly man roared and tried his best to resist the chains around him. He also had to deal with Lu Ming’s dozens of long Spears. He was in a flurry.</p><p>At this moment, the iron chain that Lu Ming waved broke through the bald man’s defense and firmly entangled him.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The bald burly man was incomparably shocked and furious as he roared repeatedly.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Let’s go down together!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The bald man was so anxious that his bald head was covered in cold sweat. The saber in his hand slashed at the iron chain crazily. However, the iron chain was made of an unknown material that was extremely hard. The bald man couldn’t cut it for a while.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, more iron chains wrapped around Lu Ming and the bald burly man and dragged them into the deep pit.</p><p>Outside the deep pit, Xu Zhong, Huang Jing and the white-haired old man had used all their strength to escape from the range of the iron chains. They had fled far away.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>The iron chain dragged Lu Ming and the bald burly man and kept falling.</p><p>“No, no, I can’t die Here!”</p><p>The bald man struggled with all his might and roared repeatedly.</p><p>However, he could not break free from the restraints of the iron chains.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was very calm as he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming had encountered countless dangerous situations. He knew very well that the more dangerous it was, the more he could not panic. Only then could he find a way to solve it.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique in his body was circulating at full force, healing his injuries.</p><p>The pit was really deep.</p><p>The iron chain dragged the two of them down more than two thousand meters before they finally reached the bottom.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The iron chains pulled the two of them and they fell to the ground.</p><p>Then, the chain loosened and Lu Ming and the bald man regained their freedom.</p><p>As soon as he regained his freedom, the bald man quickly stepped aside and looked at Lu Ming cautiously.</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at him and started to size up his surroundings.</p><p>The pit was very dark, and the distance one could see was very limited.</p><p>He could vaguely make out several figures sitting cross-legged on the ground in the surroundings. On each figure, there were a few iron chains that were dancing and swaying like poisonous snakes.</p><p>At a glance, there were at least a hundred figures.</p><p>“Hehe, you’ve all fallen into my ten thousand corpse array and become my refined corpses!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice rang out.</p><p>“How dare you, heavenly corpse sect’s disciple! I’m a second grade Emperor sky Divine Guard of the Emperor sky divine Palace. I advise you to let me go now. Otherwise, when the experts of my Emperor sky divine Palace arrive, it will be the day of your death.”</p><p>The bald man roared.</p><p>“Hehe, so what if you’re from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? There were indeed a few people who escaped just now, but even if they reported to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace sent experts here, it would still take at least three days. Three days is enough for me to complete my task and refine you all into refined corpses!”</p><p>The cold voice sounded again.</p><p>“You want to refine me into a refined corpse? dream on!”</p><p>The bald burly man roared and his body shot up into the sky, wanting to rush out.</p><p>However, iron chains were flying in all directions and appeared above his head.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The bald man continued to attack the iron chain, but it was completely useless.</p><p>hehe, in my ten thousand corpse array, even a Lv 3 martial King realm warrior can’t get out, let alone a peak Lv 1 martial King like you. Just become my refined corpse!</p><p>The voice sneered.</p><p>Huhu ~</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a gust of wind seemed to blow in the deep pit. At the same time, a gray mist filled the air.</p><p>“Not good, it’s corpse Qi!”</p><p>The bald man’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>don’t put up any useless resistance. Turn into a refined corpse under my corpse Qi!</p><p>The voice laughed.</p><p>The thick corpse Qi immediately enveloped the bald man and Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He circulated his essential core and covered his entire body to resist the corpse Qi around him.</p><p>But-</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>As soon as the corpse Qi came into contact with the Zhen Yuan, it began to corrode it quickly.</p><p>On the other side, the bald man roared. He was facing the same result.</p><p>I told you, it’s useless. This is the Qi of ten thousand corpses condensed by the ten thousand corpse array. It can corrode one’s Zhen Yuan. You can’t resist it at all, haha!</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>damn it, damn it! Lu Ming, it’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!</p><p>The bald man roared again and again. He was so scared that he wanted to die.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not pulled him down, why would he be in such a desperate situation?</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He circulated his essential core with all his might and controlled his nine Dragon bloodline at the same time to burst out with the devouring power.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh!</p><p>The corpse Qi around Lu Ming had indeed been devoured by the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. It had no effect on Lu Ming.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had used it very secretively and no one else had noticed.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and began to channel his energy to heal his injuries. However, in the eyes of others, he was channeling his energy to resist the corpse Qi.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The bald burly man continued to roar as he sat down cross-legged, channeling his energy to resist the attack.</p><p>Kachachi</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a soft sound and was moving to recover.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current physical strength, his recovery ability was simply terrifying. In addition to the true war Dragon technique, Lu Ming’s recovery energy had already reached an abnormal level.</p><p>One hour. In just one hour, Lu Ming’s injuries had fully recovered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes, stood up, and strode toward the bald man.</p><p>Just now, he had only wanted to heal his injuries and had never thought of letting the bald man go.</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s movement, the bald man opened his eyes and stood up in a hurry, shouting, ” “Lu Ming, what are you doing?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
