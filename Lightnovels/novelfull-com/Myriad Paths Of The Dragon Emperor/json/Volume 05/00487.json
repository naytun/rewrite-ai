His position as the Emperor of the burning sun Empire was almost stable, so he was naturally happy.</p><p>As for whether or not he was a puppet of the ten direction Sword School, who cared?</p><p>As long as he sat on the emperor’s throne, he could enjoy it without restraint.</p><p>The Heavenly King Zhen was surrounded by women on the left and on the right. His hands wandered around the two beautiful girls ‘bodies, and he felt extremely good.</p><p>Just as he was feeling good, suddenly, a burly man in iron armor rushed in with an anxious face.</p><p>“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, bad news, bad news!”</p><p>The burly man roared.</p><p>Heaven suppression King’s face darkened, and he said coldly, ” “Xu Feng, what’s the matter that you’re in such a panic? can’t you see that I’m inviting all the civil and military officials to discuss the country’s Affairs? How are you going to conquer the world with me in the future if you’re so uncollected?”</p><p>he’s simply embarrassing me.

There’s an urgent message from the front. The mystic essence sword sect has been in a great battle. The ten directions sword sect and the sun Army have been annihilated. Qiu Wuyang and Qiu changkong have both died!</p><p>Xu Feng quickly shouted.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>The dancing women seemed to be frozen in time.</p><p>The civil and military officials were also in a similar state. Their movements stopped, and some of them were holding their wine glasses to drink, but the wine almost fell into their nostrils.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen opened his mouth and looked at Xu Feng in a daze. Then, his pupils kept enlarging and his body started to tremble. He asked in a trembling voice, ” “Xu Gan, Xu Feng, are you serious? If I find out that you’ve lied to me, I’ll execute your entire family!”</p><p>“It’s absolutely true, Your Majesty. A general from the ten directions Sword School was lucky enough to survive.

First, his lips began to tremble, and then his entire body began to tremble.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen? How could the mystical sword sect kill Qiu Wuyang and the others with their strength?”</p><p>The Heavenly King kept mumbling to himself in disbelief.</p><p>it’s Marquis champion. Marquis champion has returned and easily killed all the experts from the ten direction sword sect and the sun Army!</p><p>Xu Feng said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, it’s actually him.

He looked at the two people in the sky in horror.</p><p>“Old man, today is the day you die. I’m going to take your head and offer it to my father’s spirit in heaven!”</p><p>When he saw the Heavenly King, Hua Chi’s eyes turned red and he revealed a bone-deep hatred.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill them all!”</p><p>The Heavenly King roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Six figures rushed out of the crowd, each of them exuding the aura of a 9th level martial ancestor.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen had actually secretly recruited six 9th level martial ancestor realm experts. This was quite extraordinary.</p><p>“What Marquis champion? Go to hell!”</p><p>A middle-aged man with a cold and fierce expression slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other five people appeared.</p><p>For a moment, the world was extremely violent. The spirit Qi was boiling, and all kinds of sword Qi and saber Qi were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>With the six 9th level martial arts Grandmaster powerhouses joining forces, even a large city would be instantly destroyed.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>The Heavenly King’s eyes were filled with hope.</p><p>“A clown!”</p><p>Lu Ming uttered a faint voice.</p><p>He stood still in the air. Lightning flashed in his eyes, and then six Thunderbolts shot out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With six crisp sounds, the six 9th level martial grandmasters under the Heavenly King were turned into ashes and disappeared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Heavenly King fell to the ground and his body trembled again, several times more than before.</p><p>The other civil and military officials were in a similar state. They looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>In their eyes, the invincible ninth-grade martial arts Grandmaster had turned into ashes with just one glare from Lu Ming. This was simply unbelievable. This was simply the means of a God. It was not something that human strength could match.</p><p>Marquis champion Wudi, your servant Gao Chuan, welcomes the return of the Marquis champion and the eighth prince!</p><p>Suddenly, a sneaky-looking Minister shouted from below. He looked at Lu Ming and Hua Chi with a fawning expression.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Hua Chi were slightly taken aback.</p><p>Marquis champion, eighth prince, you don’t know this, but I have always been loyal to the late Emperor. I have endured the humiliation to stay by the side of heavenly suppression King, waiting for the day when the eighth prince returns. The heavens have eyes, eighth prince, you have finally returned!</p><p>Gao Chuan shouted, his face full of flattery.</p><p>“Damn it, this Gao Chuan is really quick to change his boat!”</p><p>The other officials gritted their teeth.</p><p>“Oh? According to what I know, when the Heavenly King of suppression charged into the imperial capital, you were the first to surrender. You even opened the city gates and let the Heavenly King of suppression’s Army in.”</p><p>Hua Chi sneered.</p><p>Gao Chuan’s expression changed drastically. He squeezed out a smile and said, ” “Eighth prince, you’ve misunderstood, you’ve misunderstood!”</p><p>there’s no need to explain to me. Go down and explain to my father!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Hua Chi unsheathed his sword and cut Gao Chuan in half.</p><p>“Old man, it’s your turn now!”</p><p>Hua Chi looked at the Heavenly King.</p><p>Chi ‘er, Chi’ er, I’m your Imperial uncle. We’re blood relatives. On this account, I beg you, I beg you to spare me this once!</p><p>Sky King shouted.</p><p>“Spare you? When you killed my father er, why didn’t you think that he was your blood relative? now you’re saying that he’s your blood relative? you’re so shameless! Die!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were like lightning as he pointed his sword at the Heavenly King suppression.</p><p>“No, protect the Emperor! Guards, protect the Emperor!”</p><p>The Heavenly King Zhen started to shout crazily.</p><p>However, no one moved. Everyone sat there in silence, not moving an inch.</p><p>What a joke.
