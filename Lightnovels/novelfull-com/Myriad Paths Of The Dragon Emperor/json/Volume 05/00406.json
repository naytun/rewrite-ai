Buzzzzzz!</p><p>...</p><p>Right at this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds rang out in the distance, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>that’s the genius from the blazing flame Mountain region. The people from the blazing flame Mountain region have also come.</p><p>another super region. How can we have a share in this!</p><p>and the most powerful man in the flaming Mountains, bu Feifan, is here!</p><p>When this group of people arrived, everyone burst out in another wave of exclamations.</p><p>Even the geniuses from the Phoenix Lake area were frowning.</p><p>“Hahaha, Huang chixuan, I didn’t expect you to be here too!”</p><p>The geniuses from the flaming Mountain region stopped on the other side of the lake, putting some distance between them and the people from the Phoenix Lake Region. A young man with long, fiery red hair laughed.</p><p>“Bu Feifan, if you can come, I can naturally come too!”</p><p>Huang chixuan sneered.</p><p>haha, it’s really lively. Let’s join!</p><p>With a loud laugh, dozens of rainbow lights came rapidly from the sky.</p><p>The rainbow light dissipated, revealing dozens of young figures, who stopped on the other side of the lake.</p><p>“It’s the people from the Yang Spring Valley area!”</p><p>the Super region, Yangquan Valley!</p><p>Some people were already in despair.</p><p>Super regions had arrived one after another, and the strongest people were all among them.</p><p>The arrival of the Yang Spring Valley area made the faces of bu Feifan, Huang chixuan, and the others sink.</p><p>To the North of this Lake was the Dragon head of Dragon Mountain.</p><p>The three super regions stopped in the East, South, and West of the lake. It was obvious that they were wary of each other.</p><p>Following that, more and more people arrived, but no one was able to attract the attention of the three super regions.</p><p>Half an hour later, a young man in a gray robe with a long sword in his arms appeared above the lake without a sound.</p><p>This young man had an ordinary appearance. He was dressed in a gray robe and looked very old. He stood quietly in the air.</p><p>However, Huang chixuan, bu Feifan, and the strongest expert in the Yang Spring Valley, Sun Chu, all changed their expressions when they saw this person.</p><p>Xuan Feng of the ancient barren city!</p><p>Huang chixuan said solemnly.</p><p>As soon as he said this, it caused a commotion.</p><p>“What? Ancient desolate city? Could this person be someone from the ancient barren city?”</p><p>it’s said that the ancient barren city is extremely mysterious. Very few people come out, but once they do, they’re peerless monsters. If this person is from the ancient barren city, then he’s terrifying.</p><p>it seems like the dragon’s cave is very attractive to these peerless geniuses!</p><p>“There’s going to be a good show to watch this time!”</p><p>While the crowd was discussing, Xuan Feng of the ancient barren city still held his sword in his arms and remained silent. His expression didn’t even change.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others looked at Xuan Feng with a little fear and did not say a word.</p><p>Following that, the number of people increased, and it quickly broke through four thousand.</p><p>At a glance, the lake was surrounded by people.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes swept over and revealed a look of disgust, he said coldly, ” a bunch of trash wants to get their hands on the treasures in the dragon’s cave. They’re really delusional and overconfident.</p><p>Many people’s faces changed, but for fear of the Phoenix Lake area and Huang chixuan’s strength, no one dared to say anything.</p><p>“Hmph, what a bunch of trash!”</p><p>Huang chixuan snorted, then said to bu Feifan and sun Chu, ” bu Feifan, Sun Chu, why don’t we do this? before we Enter the dragon’s cave, let’s clean up all these garbage. What do you think? ”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>Bu Feifan and sun Chu both nodded.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>the people from the larger regions can stay. Fly to the sky. As for the trash from the smaller regions, get out of my way and don’t get in the way!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes were like lightning as he looked around and scolded loudly.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the experts from the larger regions all heaved a sigh of relief and flew up into the sky, distancing themselves from the people from the smaller regions.</p><p>The rest were all people from small areas.</p><p>The people in the small area had ugly expressions. They looked at each other, but no one left.</p><p>Who would be willing to leave so easily?</p><p>“It seems that you guys aren’t going to get lost, right?”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Huang chixuan, you guys are too overbearing. The dragon’s cave is a land without an owner. Anyone can come and get an opportunity. Why should it be occupied by you? I’m not convinced. There are so many of us here, we don’t have to be afraid of you!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Oh? It seems like you’re not going to leave?”</p><p>Huang chixuan sneered, then he looked at bu Feifan and sun Chu and said, ” you two, each of us will take a direction. How about this, we’ll each clear a direction and see which side is faster? ”</p><p>“Good, this is interesting!”</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Bu Feifan and sun Chu both laughed.</p><p>“Then let’s begin!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Huang chixuan’s voice fell, his figure flashed like lightning.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill scream was heard and everyone saw that a young man’s heart was pierced by Huang chixuan’s claw.</p><p>The young man let out a desperate roar and finally stopped breathing.</p><p>“You’re just a piece of trash, yet you talk so much. Die!”</p><p>Huang chixuan sneered.</p><p>“Whoever doesn’t get lost will die in the next moment!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Huang chixuan’s mouth.</p><p>damn it, they’re going too far. If we work together, we don’t have to be afraid of them!</p><p>A tall young man roared, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>He was at the peak of the 7th level of the Grandmaster realm. He was a genius who was not weaker than Jian Fengyun. He was most likely the strongest person in a small area.</p><p>“Then we’ll die together!”</p><p>Huang chixuan sneered and his figure rushed towards the young man.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The young man roared and slashed out a shocking saber ray.</p><p>But in the next moment-</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s claws seemed to be able to pierce through everything. The blade light was shattered and then, like the previous person, his heart was pierced.</p><p>The strongest person in a small area had died!</p><p>a piece of trash dares to make such a big fuss? you’re looking for death!</p><p>A red light flashed on Huang chixuan’s claws, but not a single drop of blood was stained.</p><p>The others were extremely frightened. He was too strong, and they were no match for him at all. The strongest expert of a small region was killed in a single move. The gap was too great.</p><p>“If you don’t retreat within three breaths, kill without mercy!”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes were cold as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Masters of Phoenix Lake moved quickly, exuding powerful auras.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>Finally, someone roared and retreated unwillingly.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Helplessly, the people in the small area all retreated.</p><p>As for the other two directions, they were in a similar situation. After a few experts were killed, they also retreated helplessly.</p><p>After a few breaths, only the people in the area were left.</p><p>Of course, Xuan Feng had been holding his sword and did not move.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others naturally would not touch him.</p><p>In an instant, all the people in the small area had left.</p><p>No, there was only one person left. That was Lu Ming.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming was at the east side of the lake. Phoenix Lake was in charge of this side.</p><p>At this time, he was standing there alone and appeared very conspicuous.</p><p>The geniuses from Phoenix Lake, Flaming Mountain range, Yangquan Valley, and other large areas all looked at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
