He had never thought of taking it. The explosive Yuan pill was meant to be used to save his life at a critical moment. However, he had no other choice because of Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>Today, he had to win. He had no way out.</p><p>If he was defeated, not only would he lose all his face, but he would also lose 80000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals. For him, 80000 pieces of Supreme spiritual crystals was an astronomical figure that he could not afford.</p><p>Therefore, he blamed everything on Lu Ming. He could not wait to eat his flesh and drink his blood.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xue Chao wielded the Thunderbolt sword in his hand and charged towards Lu Ming in an extremely violent manner.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked with his long spear. Three concepts intertwined as he engaged in a great battle with Xue Chao.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The fighting ring kept shaking as intent spread and true Yuan shot out.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated the true war Dragon technique and had already reached the ninth level. He had ten times the essential Qi.</p><p>Although he had only converted 50% of it, and the other half was still his true Qi, it was still a bit obscure to circulate, so he couldn’t use his full strength. However, it was still not inferior to Xue Chao’s true Yuan.</p><p>In terms of intent, the three types of intent combined still could not compare to one that had been condensed into an intent rune. However, with the Dragon God’s three absolutes, the difference in power would not be too great. That was why Lu Ming was able to fight Xue Chao.</p><p>However, after Xue Chao swallowed the explosive Yuan pill, Lu Ming was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was even more excited.</p><p>“Yes, this is the feeling, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He exerted the three concepts to the extreme. The three concepts intertwined together and kept clashing with Xue Chao.</p><p>He could feel that the Thunder mentality was merging with the Wind and Fire mentality.</p><p>Although it was slow, it was indeed merging.</p><p>“Haha, fight, fight, fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming howled madly, unleashing all the strength in his body to resist Xue Chao with all his might. However, he was still at a complete disadvantage and was suppressed by Xue Chao’s violent attacks, his figure constantly retreating.</p><p>In the eyes of others, this was not the case. They did not know Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>“Lu Ming is going to lose. He’s completely suppressed.”</p><p>“That’s right. Right now, he’s only putting up a last-ditch struggle, but he won’t be able to resist for long. Once he’s defeated, he’ll have to face Xue Chao’s storm-like attacks. At that time, I’m afraid he’ll be defeated and killed.”</p><p>if I were Lu Ming, I would admit defeat right now. It’s already an honor to be able to fight a King tier to this extent. In the past thousand years, only Yan kuangtu from a hundred years ago was able to do this.</p><p>that’s right. If Lu Ming can maintain this momentum, his future will be limitless. It would be a pity if he were to die in the hands of Xue Chao.</p><p>By now, there were more and more onlookers. There were already more than twenty thousand people. Even one of the nine Palace Masters had come.</p><p>Some were gloating, while others were worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m certain that Lu Ming will be defeated and killed within twenty moves.”</p><p>Someone said with certainty.</p><p>Very soon, twenty moves had passed. Lu Ming was still holding on, although the situation did not look good.</p><p>cough, cough. I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be so tough. His will to live is supporting him, but it’s useless. This time, he will be defeated after another thirty moves.</p><p>The person who had said that Lu Ming would be defeated and killed within twenty moves coughed a few times and made his comments.</p><p>Very soon, another thirty moves had passed and Lu Ming was still standing strong.</p><p>cough, cough, cough. This time, Lu Ming will definitely be defeated and killed within fifty moves!</p><p>The man kept coughing awkwardly, but his mouth was sharp and he came to a conclusion.</p><p>The people around him looked at him with disdain and kept their distance.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know anything and would not pay attention to it. Now, all his thoughts were on the three concepts.</p><p>“Almost, almost, just a little bit more, just a little bit more!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the three intents let out a loud boom. Then, with a loud boom, they actually merged into one.</p><p>The fusion was a success. The wind, fire, and Thunder intents had finally fused together.</p><p>When the three intents were successfully combined, the power of the Dragon God’s three absolutes would automatically evolve from heaven-grade low-rank to heaven-grade high-rank.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming now had the power of the third stage of the heaven level superior martial arts technique.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A three-colored true dragon flew out with a deafening dragon roar. Its aura was extremely terrifying, and it was several times stronger than before.</p><p>“Ah, ah, how could this be? What’s going on?”</p><p>Xue Chao was shocked.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The lightning sword radiance that he had unleashed with all his might crumbled like trash in front of the three-colored true dragon.</p><p>The three-colored true dragon pounced over and clawed at Xue Chao’s body. Xue Chao let out a blood-curdling screech as his body flew far away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and his body rushed out. The long spear lashed out and hit Xue Chao’s body.</p><p>Immediately, the sound of bones breaking rang out, and Xue Chao’s body was sent flying along the fighting ring.</p><p>After flying for over a thousand meters, he lay on the ground, coughing up large mouthfuls of blood. His body twitched non-stop, and he was already half-dead.</p><p>In the audience, everyone’s eyes were about to explode. They were tongue-tied and looked on in a daze.</p><p>“Hey, was I hallucinating because I was staring at you? I actually saw Lu Ming suddenly explode and beat Xue Chao half to death. Don’t you think it’s funny?”</p><p>“No way. You saw it too. I thought I was seeing things. It can’t be true, right?”</p><p>one was seeing things, two were seeing things, but not all three. I f * cking saw it too.</p><p>“Nest, nest, no way. Is this real? are we dreaming? Lu Ming suddenly exploded and won? How is this possible? how is this possible?”</p><p>that’s right. He was clearly being suppressed earlier. How did he suddenly win? ”</p><p>could he be cheating? ”</p><p>Everyone looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>It was simply incomprehensible. In the end, he could only think that Lu Ming had cheated.</p><p>“Cheating! Lu Ming, you bastard! You’re despicable! How dare you cheat in the middle of a great battle!”</p><p>Qiu changkong flew out and shouted hysterically.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Xue Chao, a King. Qiu changkong could finally accept this.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Qiu changkong.</p><p>“What did you just say? You cheated, but you don’t allow others to talk about it? Preposterous? Tell me, what method did you use to cheat? tell me the truth, there are so many people here, including the various Palace Masters, how can you be so presumptuous?”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, don’t go too far. Even Xue Chao was able to use the explosive Yuan pill, so it wouldn’t be too much even if brother Lu used some tricks!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun flew out from the crowd and shouted.</p><p>In his heart, he was inclined to believe that Lu Ming had used some means. However, if Xue Chao could use the explosive Yuan pill, why couldn’t lu Ming use some means?</p><p>he’s definitely not using any ordinary means. It’s a despicable and shameless method.</p><p>Qiu changkong refused to let go of Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, this battle doesn’t count. Our bet is off!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang also shouted.</p><p>“Cancel it. Sheng Wushuang, you want to renege on your debt after losing? Do you think you can deny it? hand over the best spiritual crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Wushuang coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
