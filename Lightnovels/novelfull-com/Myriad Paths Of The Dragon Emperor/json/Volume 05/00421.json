He knew very well that even the most powerful young man in the thousand River region might not be able to make it through.</p><p>He was extremely anxious.</p><p>Just like Zhao sui, the elder leading the team in the YouMo Palace, han Xun, also had a terrible look on his face.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people who appeared in the Ditian divine guards ‘area grew fewer and fewer.</p><p>“Eh? Zhao sui, why do you look so pale? ” In my opinion, the geniuses of the thousand River region must have gone to the last stage. And they must have passed it. It would be a glorious thing to see a group of people on the first level of the fighting ring!”</p><p>Lu Xiu said with a smile.</p><p>“Shut up, Lu!”</p><p>Zhao sui’s eyes turned red.</p><p>Lu Xiu was mocking him. How could there be so many people in the thousand River region who could pass the last level? even if there was one, he would laugh his head off.</p><p>“Haha, calm down, calm down!”</p><p>Lu Xiu laughed out loud, almost causing Zhao sui to vomit blood.</p><p>it seems like the geniuses of the thousand River region died in battle. I wonder which powerful region did it. I really have to thank them.</p><p>Lu Xiu thought.</p><p>Lu Xiu was elated to see Zhao sui in such a state.</p><p>In the past, it was the opposite.</p><p>Very quickly, half an hour had passed.</p><p>Many people could no longer sit still.</p><p>“How is that possible? Why are there so few geniuses in Phoenix Lake?”</p><p>us too. Where are our people from Flaming Mountain? ”</p><p>“Argh! Only four people from my Yangquan Valley region have become Emperor sky divine guards. That’s impossible!”</p><p>…</p><p>Loud roars rang out.</p><p>Half an hour had passed. Even if he managed to clear the next level, he should have failed and come out.</p><p>However, he had yet to come out, which meant that he had most likely fallen in the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>Among them, the team-leading elders of the Phoenix Lake area, the Yangquan Valley area, and the flaming Mountain area were the loudest.</p><p>They were a super region, and geniuses were as numerous as the clouds. At the very least, there would be 34 people who could become the Empyrean heaven divine guards.</p><p>But now, there were only two or three of them. This meant that the geniuses of these regions had died in batches in the eastern nether ancient battlefield.</p><p>Some were happy, some were worried.</p><p>Some of the elders who were leading the teams from other regions were all smiles because their regions had achieved so much success that they had even exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“This time, 820 Ditian divine guards have already appeared. It’s a little more than the previous years. This generation is truly full of geniuses!”</p><p>not bad. In the past, five hundred people were already considered good. Adding up the North, South, East, and West, it’s already very good to have two thousand people. This time, it’s far more!</p><p>“Now, let’s see how many people can get past the final checkpoint and reach the first level of the fighting ring,”</p><p>“I estimate that there will be more than twelve!”</p><p>we have 13 super regions on our side. The strongest person in each super region should be able to make it to the end!</p><p>not necessarily. Maybe there’s a super dark Horse? ”</p><p>“Just wait and see!”</p><p>“Look, there’s a fluctuation on the first level’s battle platform. Someone has passed the last level and is about to appear!”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on the fighting ring at the bottom.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space trembled, and a young figure appeared.</p><p>This young man was dressed in a blood-red robe. His face was pale and cold. He was zang Sheng from the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>“Eh? Who was this person? I don’t think he’s from any of the 13 super regions.”</p><p>he’s actually the first one to succeed. Could it be that he’s able to suppress the geniuses of the Super regions? ”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>Especially the elders who were leading the teams, they were all making guesses.</p><p>“Haha, this man is the peerless genius of our Dragon burial abyss. Zang Sheng!”</p><p>Suddenly, a maniacal laugh was heard.</p><p>“What? The people of the Dragon burial abyss, the Dragon burial abyss has appeared?”</p><p>I didn’t expect that the Dragon burial abyss would have such a genius the moment it appeared. It’s really amazing!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” what? ” the surrounding spectators all exclaimed.</p><p>Below, on the fighting ring, once zang Sheng appeared, he swept his gaze around. When he realized that he was alone, his face revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>haha, this time, the eastern sky divine guards of the four sky divine guards will definitely be mine!</p><p>Zang Sheng roared in his heart.</p><p>“Someone else has appeared!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>On the fighting ring, there was another fluctuation, and then a figure appeared.</p><p>Qiu changkong. The second figure to appear was actually Qiu changkong.</p><p>Lu Xiu was stunned. Then, his body trembled with excitement as he roared, ” haha, this is the genius of the cloud Emperor mountain range, the genius of the cloud Emperor mountain range!</p><p>Lu Xiu had never expected that someone would actually make it to the last stage.</p><p>Lu Xiu’s roar immediately caused an uproar.</p><p>“What? A genius from the cloud Emperor mountain range? How was that possible? The cloud Emperor mountain range was a place where even birds don’t want to shit. How could someone make it to the last stage? Don’t lie to me. ”</p><p>“I don’t believe it either!”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with discussions.</p><p>“No, that’s impossible!”</p><p>Zhao sui roared. He had seen Qiu changkong before, and he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</p><p>The moment Qiu changkong appeared, he swept his gaze over the crowd. When he saw zang Sheng, he snorted coldly and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He actually appeared faster than him?</p><p>Zang Sheng did not back down and looked back coldly.</p><p>At this moment, in a secret room in the assessment venue.</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he punched continuously. His fists were so powerful that they disappeared with a loud boom. Lu Ming stood still as he retracted his fists.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>The old man’s figure appeared again.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve passed this round. There’s still one last round!</p><p>The old man waved his hand, and the scene changed again.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he had appeared on another platform. In front of him, there was a middle-aged man with a spear on his back.</p><p>He looked exactly the same as the burly man from before. However, the aura that this middle-aged burly man exuded this time was extremely terrifying. It was several times stronger than before.</p><p>Half step King warrior, this time it was actually half step King warrior!</p><p>The peak of martial ancestor realm and half-step King realm seemed to be only one step away, but the gap was huge.</p><p>If one had to describe the difference, an ordinary half-step King was at least two levels higher than a peak ninth level martial ancestor.</p><p>Yes, more than two levels.</p><p>“As long as you can defeat me, you’ll pass!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. This level was too difficult. He reckoned that not many people would pass it.</p><p>One had to be at least at the peak of the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm. Furthermore, one had to be a four-battle genius to pass.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the middle-aged man bellowed. His long spear was like a dragon as it charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Spear’s gleam burst out and enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste any more time. He immediately cast the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
