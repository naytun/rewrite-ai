These flowers were actually in the shape of a Dragon. It was as if a small dragon was soaring in the sky, and it was extremely lifelike.</p><p>...</p><p>This was a dragon’s blood flower. It was said that it could only grow when the blood of a true dragon was spilled. It was many times more precious than Dragon saliva grass.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With these dragon blood flowers, Lu Ming’s true war Dragon technique would probably advance to the next level.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, an extremely sharp force slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was Huang chixuan.</p><p>At that moment, his eyes were cold as he slashed his phoenix wings at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward without hesitation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s body flew out, while Lu Ming hit the wall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands moved quickly, plucking more than ten dragon blood flowers and storing them in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming put away the Dragon blood flower, Huang chixuan snorted coldly and turned to leave.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes and a murderous intent appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Then, he continued to move forward along the cave.</p><p>This cave was still very wide, and it was definitely a place where true dragons could enter and exit.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion ahead.</p><p>“A bone is embedded here!”</p><p>“Could this be a Dragon Bone?”</p><p>“Haha, it’s mine!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Instantly, a loud boom and battle cries could be heard.</p><p>dragon bones? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he flew rapidly in that direction.</p><p>If it really was a Dragon Bone, its value would be terrifying. It was much more valuable than Dragon saliva grass and dragon blood flower.</p><p>“Phoenix Lake, Huang chixuan, you’re despicable! Achoo!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming arrived, he could already hear angry roars and screams.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a flash of lightning and crossed several miles in an instant.</p><p>On the wall in front of him, a bone Xun the size of a water tank was embedded in the stone wall.</p><p>The bone armor was crystal clear like jade, full of Holy Qi, and exuded a terrifying essence Qi fluctuation.</p><p>Huang chixuan led five or six masters of Phoenix Lake and killed more than a dozen young men from other areas.</p><p>“Haha, the Dragon Bone is mine!”</p><p>Huang chixuan laughed.</p><p>He reached out to grab the Dragon Bone and pulled it out, but the Dragon Bone did not move at all.</p><p>“So tight? Again!”</p><p>Just as Huang chixuan was about to use all his strength to pull out the Dragon Bone.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and kicked instinctively.</p><p>Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Huang chixuan was shocked and quickly abandoned the Dragon Bone, using the Phoenix Wing slash.</p><p>The other young men from Phoenix Lake also used their unique skills to block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s body trembled slightly. For the other Masters of Phoenix Lake, his face turned pale and he almost spat out blood.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also retreated rapidly.</p><p>Other than Huang chixuan, the other six people in Phoenix Lake were all in the eighth grade of martial ancestor realm. Furthermore, they were all battle-hardened.</p><p>Together, they were extremely powerful.</p><p>“Brat, it’s you again. The Dragon Bone is mine, you want to fight for it? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared.</p><p>“Yours? This is a Dragon’s Den, when did it become yours?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Fine, since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish. Let’s attack together and kill him.”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared.</p><p>Then, the Phoenix Wing slash was slashed out.</p><p>The other six Phoenix Lake experts also unleashed their ultimate moves and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm. A huge palm print was formed and blasted toward the people of Phoenix Lake.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge explosion shook the Dragon Cave and energy spread out.</p><p>However, the surroundings of the dragon’s cave were extremely hard. Even with their strength that could destroy a mountain, they could only knock down a few rocks on the cave’s stone walls.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The heaven path palm print was pierced through. Huang chixuan and the others ‘bodies only swayed slightly before they continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you will die today!”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“You’re bullying me with numbers, right? Do you think I’m afraid of you guys? dan dan (egg/egg), smash it!”</p><p>Lu Ming gently patted the stone egg hanging on his hair.</p><p>Dandan. This was the name Lu Ming had randomly given the stone egg.</p><p>Immediately, the stone egg trembled slightly, spun, and turned into the size of a human head. With a Swoosh, it rushed toward one of the Masters of Phoenix Lake.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The master of Phoenix Lake struck out with his claw, and the claw radiance was shocking.</p><p>However, he was stunned the next moment. He completely ignored the claw radiance and rushed past it. Then, he bounced up and smashed directly at the nose of the Phoenix Lake Master.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>This time, it hit him hard, and the sound of bones breaking immediately rang out.</p><p>Then, there was a shrill scream.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that it was really terrible. The bridge of his nose had completely caved in. His bones were shattered and his flesh was a mess. He could not even recognize his mother.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew back and jumped up and down in front of Lu Ming, as if she was very excited.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Damn it, what are you using? How dare you sneak attack me! Despicable!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared.</p><p>“Despicable? Huang chixuan, you scumbag, you’re actually talking to me about despicable, you’re not worthy.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared.</p><p>“Dandan, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Dandan jumped up in excitement, spun around, and flew forward with a Swoosh.</p><p>“Block it, smash it!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and struck out his strongest blow.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>However, it was useless. Dandan completely ignored these attacks and rushed past.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another young man from Phoenix Lake was smashed in the face.</p><p>Instantly, the sound of bones breaking and a shrill cry of pain sounded.</p><p>This young man had also followed in the footsteps of the person before him.</p><p>His nose, nose, and mouth had all caved in. It was unrecognizable. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>Although he was not dead, he could not use much of his combat strength.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>The remaining young men of Phoenix Lake gasped. Looking at the miserable state of the two young men, their teeth were chattering and they felt a chill down their backs.</p><p>“Who’s next?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes started to look around.</p><p>damn it, this stone egg is not afraid of energy attacks. Use weapons!</p><p>Huang chixuan roared.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then it’s you, Huang chixuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan directly flew out.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Huang chixuan wore his spirit weapon gloves and his claws grabbed towards dandan.</p><p>Just as she was about to catch dandan, she bounced up, changed direction, and smashed towards Huang chixuan.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and quickly retreated.</p><p>She tried her best to protect her face with her hands, but she was still too late.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It hit his face accurately.</p><p>A blood-curdling scream was accompanied by a furious roar.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s claws waved and at the moment when dandan hit him, he also hit dandan.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dandan was sent flying. She changed her direction halfway and flew back to Lu Ming’s side. She bounced here and there, seemingly a little unhappy.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Huang chixuan.</p><p>Although Huang chixuan was hit, he was not as miserable as the others, but he did not feel good either.</p><p>His nose was completely crooked, and a few of his teeth had fallen out, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>He was in such a sorry state.</p><p>Huang chixuan roared again and again.</p><p>Someone passed by not far away and was dumbfounded.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others were actually beaten up so badly?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
