How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful! This was heaven-defying.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xue Chao bellowed in anger. He felt that he had lost all face after Lu Ming blocked his attack.</p><p>A martial King expert would usually crush anyone below the rank of a martial King, regardless of whether they were a genius or not.</p><p>This was because those who could break through to the martial King realm were peerless geniuses. Those who were not talented would find it difficult to break through to the martial King realm.</p><p>Moreover, those who could break through to the martial King realm usually had to go through at least three battles.</p><p>In other words, even the weakest of the martial Kings could only win three battles when they were still martial grandmasters.</p><p>Of course, nothing was absolute. There were also World War Two geniuses who had broken through to the martial King realm, but there were too few of them.</p><p>He was already a genius, and on top of that, there was the natural chasm of a martial King. It was too difficult to cross it.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had actually blocked one of his moves. It was unbelievable.</p><p>“A heaven level martial arts technique. The power of Lu Ming’s move is already equivalent to a heaven level martial arts technique.”</p><p>The palace Master of fire said with bright eyes.</p><p>not bad. I didn’t expect that Lu Ming would be able to cultivate a heaven rank martial art technique even before he reached the martial King realm. He’s indeed very talented. Although it’s barely the first stage of a heaven rank lower level martial art technique, it’s already very rare.</p><p>The wind Palace Master also nodded.</p><p>Of course, the words of the hall Masters were not concealed and spread far and wide.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. Lu Ming had cultivated a heaven level martial arts technique. No wonder he could block Xue Chao’s attack.</p><p>Even among the lower-level martial Kings, there were many who had not cultivated a heaven-level martial skill.</p><p>“Xue Chao, didn’t you say that you would defeat me in three moves? now that you’ve made two moves, there’s still one more move left.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Xue Chao bellowed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An even more powerful aura suddenly rushed out of Xue Chao’s body.</p><p>True essence filled his body like a tsunami.</p><p>True origin and intent realm made Xue Chao’s aura reach the peak. This was the true strength of a martial King.</p><p>However, this was not the end. A lightning sword flew out, extremely bright.</p><p>Six silver chakras were circling the combat sword.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned solemn. Xue Chao was going to unleash his full power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve forced me to do this. If you can’t withstand this move, you’ll die. You’ve brought this upon yourself. Purple electric sword of destruction!”</p><p>Xue Chao let out a long howl and charged towards Lu Ming like a Thunder God, slashing out a terrifying sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming activated his Blood Meridian, which had already been converted into fifty percent essential core, and started to circulate it crazily.</p><p>Then, the Wind and Fire intent soared into the sky.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>A two-colored true dragon flew out with a roar.</p><p>The roars of the Dragon shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was stunned.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two-colored true dragon and Xue Chao’s Thunderbolt battle sword heavily collided.</p><p>The divine guards ‘fighting stage let out a violent roar and kept shaking.</p><p>The terrifying force and intent realm exploded in all directions.</p><p>Everyone was shocked and wanted to Dodge. The hall Masters waved their hands and a light curtain formed, blocking the force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The light on the divine guards platform dissipated.</p><p>A figure took nine steps back, each step causing the platform to rumble.</p><p>It was Lu Ming.</p><p>As for Xue Chao, he was also forced to take three steps back.</p><p>“Heavens!”</p><p>Everyone was staring at the two figures on the fighting ring in a daze.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming was at a disadvantage. However, everyone was not shocked by Xue Chao’s power. On the contrary, they were shocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Xue Chao had already used all his strength, yet Lu Ming was still able to withstand it. He was only at a slight disadvantage and even forced Xue Chao to retreat a few steps.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Many people even rubbed their eyes hard, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>“Nest, nest, what did I just see? I’m going to witness a miracle.”</p><p>a half-step King can actually block the attack of a King and even push him back. This is crazy, crazy.</p><p>“In that case, doesn’t that mean that Lu Ming already has the combat strength of a King?”</p><p>“My God, this is too shocking.”</p><p>In the surroundings, many Di Tian divine guards were so excited that their faces were flushed red as they shouted.</p><p>Even the palace Masters were shocked.</p><p>Wind and Fire intents. This is the fusion of the Wind and Fire intents. Lu Ming clearly had not comprehended the intents before this. Now, he has comprehended both intents. This speed is too fast!</p><p>The wind Palace Master said in an extremely shocked manner.</p><p>cultivating two elements at the same time and being able to comprehend two types of force to the level of intent in such a short time. This kind of talent is really too shocking.</p><p>The palace Master of fire also sighed.</p><p>This was especially so for the wind Palace Master. He recalled that he had previously advised Lu Ming to give up on the fire concept. After being rejected by Lu Ming, he was filled with displeasure and thought that Lu Ming was arrogant and stubborn.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, his face was a little hot.</p><p>Lu Ming used the results to tell everyone that he was not arrogant or stubborn. He had the talent to cultivate two concepts at the same time.</p><p>On the side, Thunder Palace master’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>In the crowd, Sheng Wushuang’s face turned even uglier.</p><p>He was the first person to berate Lu Ming like an elder.</p><p>He said that Lu Ming’s future was limited and he could not be compared to him in the future.</p><p>However, the truth was that Lu Ming cultivated two concepts at the same time and his speed was still terrifying. He was much faster than many people who cultivated one concept.</p><p>In such a short period of time, both of them had comprehended intent.</p><p>This was simply a slap to his face.</p><p>His eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang, what do you think of my Wind and Fire will? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Sheng Wushuang with a smile as if he had sensed his gaze.</p><p>“Hmph, I was just lucky. Besides, so what if I’ve comprehended the Wind and Fire essence? He’s still going to be defeated!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang sneered.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Xue Chao roared.</p><p>He felt like he was going crazy. He was a martial King, but he had been forced back by a half-step King. This was a great humiliation. From now on, he would become a laughingstock among the king tiers.</p><p>Since ancient times, how many kings had been forced back by half-step Kings? He would be recorded in history.</p><p>Therefore, he was furious and hateful. He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming, how can you stop me with your Wind and Fire mentality? purple lightning sword of destruction, kill, kill, kill!</p><p>Xue Chao roared, his killing intent surging like the tide.</p><p>True essence gushed out, lightning flashed, and sword Qi tore through the air. It was sharp and terrifying.</p><p>With such a powerful battle-power, normal half-step Kings would be able to kill a large number of them with one sword.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming was not an ordinary half-step King.</p><p>if the Wind and Fire essences aren’t enough, then I’ll add another one!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>??!</p><p>Then, another essence realm of heaven and earth rushed out of Lu Ming’s body. Bolts of lightning appeared in the sky.</p><p>Thunder concept!</p><p>As soon as the Thunder concept was released, the world and all directions became silent.</p><p>Space and time seemed to have frozen at this moment.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open, staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>Even the five Palace Masters and the dozen guardians were unable to control their emotions and widened their eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
