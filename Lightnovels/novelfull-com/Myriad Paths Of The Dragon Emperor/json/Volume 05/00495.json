They were all paid to kill. Countless innocent people had died at their hands. It could be said that every one of them deserved to be killed.</p><p>In a short while, hundreds of people had died at the hands of the two.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack!”</p><p>Finally, someone discovered Lu Ming and the ruins. Their frightened shouts spread in the underground cave.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Since they had been discovered, there was no need for the two of them to hide their auras. The two of them burst out with their full strength and charged in with a crushing momentum.</p><p>No one could stop the two.</p><p>It had to be said that the underworld Royal Palace was indeed very powerful. There were six martial King realm powerhouses in this underground cave. However, the strongest among them was only at peak Lv 2 martial King realm. It was impossible for them to resist Lu Ming and Huang Xu and they were easily killed.</p><p>&Nbsp; a deafening boom exploded in the underground cave, and it began to shake.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the end, the entire underground cave collapsed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two figures rushed out from the bottom of the lake and stood in the void.</p><p>Naturally, it was Lu Ming and the ruins.</p><p>Below, the water in the lake churned. Due to the collapse of the underground cave, a huge Whirlpool was formed. The lake water poured down and completely submerged the underground cave.</p><p>Not a single person escaped from the Hades Palace.</p><p>haha, this is great! Champion King, thanks to you, we were able to get rid of the cancer in the cloud Emperor mountain range!</p><p>Huang Xu laughed out loud, extremely carefree.</p><p>“Senior Huang, you’re too polite. I’m just doing it for the sake of convenience. Oh, right. I’ll have to trouble you with the remaining branches of the underworld Royal Palace.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>hahaha, no problem. As soon as I get back, I’ll immediately call on all the countries to surround and annihilate the people from the underworld King’s mansion.</p><p>Said Huang Xu with a smile.</p><p>“That’s good, then this junior will take his leave!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“He’s a genius. I wonder what heights he’ll reach in the future? I’m really looking forward to it!”</p><p>Looking in the direction where Lu Ming left, the ruins muttered to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming made his way to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The distance between the cloud Emperor mountain range and the myriad Star City was closer. Lu Ming only spent three days to return to the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Then, he reported the mission and returned to the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>In a large hall of the Thunder Palace, the Thunder Palace master’s face was extremely gloomy as he sat on the chair at the top.</p><p>“What’s going on? It’s been so long, why aren’t Chao ‘er and Zhangkong back yet? also, those Five Guys didn’t send me any messages!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master muttered, feeling a little anxious.</p><p>It had been so long, but Qiu changkong and Xue Chao had yet to return. This gave him a bad feeling.</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming really did not die? “That’s impossible. According to what Xu Zhong and the rest said, Lu Ming should be dead for sure. Moreover, even if he’s not dead, he’ll still die when he reaches the blazing sun Empire. But why haven’t changkong and the rest returned yet? what happened? damn it, I’m being watched closely by eccentric wind and the rest. I can’t even send people to find out more!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart.</p><p>Back then, when Xu Zhong, Huang Jing, and the rest returned to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they reported that they had encountered the people from the heavenly corpse sect and that the bald burly man had attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>This caused a huge commotion.</p><p>The wind Palace Master, Fire Palace Master, and the others were especially furious. They had suspected the Thunder Palace Master at the first moment.</p><p>However, Thunder Palace Master naturally denied it.</p><p>The Other Palace Masters didn’t have any evidence and couldn’t do anything to Thunder Palace Master. However, they had sent people to keep a close eye on Thunder Palace Master and see what he would do.</p><p>Therefore, during this period of time, the master of thunder Palace was completely unaware of what had happened in the blazing sun Empire. He also did not know that the people he had sent had all been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hall Master, Hall Master!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man ran in hurriedly.</p><p>“What is it? Speak!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said with a frown.</p><p>“Hall Master, Lu Ming, Lu Ming has returned!”</p><p>The young man shouted.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming did not die? How was that possible? Are you sure you’re not mistaken?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master suddenly stood up from his chair and almost shouted.</p><p>“It’s true. I saw him hand in the mission with my own eyes. He has already returned to the eastern sky courtyard.”</p><p>The young man reported.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, why isn’t that little bastard dead yet? How is that possible?”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared.</p><p>According to his arrangement, Lu Ming should be dead.</p><p>Even if he managed to escape from the disciples of the heavenly corpse sect, he would still die when he returned to the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had returned alive.</p><p>“Could it be that someone is secretly helping him? It’s possible, it’s very possible that the palace Masters and the palace Masters have sent people to help him in secret. It must be so!”</p><p>The light in Thunder Palace master’s eyes flickered continuously.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this little b * stard, I can’t let him live. I must find a way to get rid of him!”</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed across Thunder Palace master’s eyes.</p><p>At this moment, his expression changed and a voice transmission jade talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>He scanned it with his mind and was slightly stunned at first, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>“The Sheng family actually sent someone here at this time. Good, good, good. Doesn’t lu Ming have a grudge against Sheng Wushuang? We can use this opportunity to sow discord between the Sheng family and kill Lu Ming with the Sheng family’s hands!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master was overjoyed.</p><p>“Go and welcome the Sheng family!”</p><p>Then, Thunder Palace Master strode out.</p><p>In the West of the myriad Star City, five figures were heading toward the city.</p><p>Of the five, one was a white-haired old man, while the other four were all young.</p><p>They were all in their twenties, three men and one woman.</p><p>The four of them had one thing in common, which was that they had cold and arrogant faces, with an expression of superiority.</p><p>At this moment, two figures flew out of the myriad Star City and greeted the five of them.</p><p>One of them was Sheng Wushuang, and the other was the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>hahaha, so it’s brother shengyao. What brings you to the eastern part of the Tianxuan region? ”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master cupped his fists and laughed.</p><p>“Brother Zheng, how have you been? I did come here for a small matter!”</p><p>The grey-haired old man laughed.</p><p>“Sheng Wushuang pays his respects to the sacred glory elder!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang walked forward and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Sheng Yao looked at Sheng Wushuang and his face turned cold. He nodded slightly as a response.</p><p>hehe, Sheng Wushuang, I heard that you’ve been abused very badly. Moreover, you were abused by a Ditian Divine Guard from the same batch as you. Sheng Wushuang, you’ve really brought shame to our Sheng family!</p><p>A young man from the Sheng family sneered.</p><p>that’s right. Sheng Wushuang, you’re really a piece of trash. You’re actually being abused in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. If you were to return to the central part of the Tianxuan region, you’d be worse than trash!</p><p>The other young man sneered.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang’s face turned red and he clenched his fists tightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
