The culprit must be a martial King realm expert.</p><p>...</p><p>Their mission was to find the person who did it and take him down or kill him.</p><p>The northern Liang mountain was located in the northern part of the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. It was a total of 13 million miles away from the myriad Star City. However, with their speed, they arrived in just three days.</p><p>First, they had to go to the largest city in the Beiliang mountain area, the Beiliang city.</p><p>There was a base of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in Beiliang city.</p><p>There were already two second-rank empyrean heaven divine guards here to investigate. Their first priority was to meet up with these two second-rank empyrean heaven divine guards and understand the situation.</p><p>In the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, not all of the Empyrean heaven divine guards were young geniuses like Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>There were also many older members of the Empyrean sky divine guards. It could be said that there were people of all ages.</p><p>The purpose of the selection of the Ditian divine guards that was held every five years was to recruit geniuses with talent and potential and nurture them.</p><p>Without a doubt, these young Ditian divine guards were treated much better.</p><p>However, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would also recruit some empyrean heaven divine guards through other methods every year.</p><p>As long as one’s identity was clear and one’s strength was sufficient, one could join the Empyrean heavens divine guards. There were no requirements in terms of talent.</p><p>On the other hand, these Ditian divine guards were not treated as well as Lu Ming and the others. They also had lessons from the hall Master. They had to rely on themselves to complete various missions for the Ditian divine guards in order to obtain various rewards.</p><p>Xu Zhong and song ke were both Emperor sky divine guards.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that Huang Jing should be the same as him, a genius who had participated in the Ditian Divine Guard selection. Looking at her age, she should have been from the previous batch.</p><p>Soon, a desolate ancient city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The ancient city was very majestic and filled with the aura of time.</p><p>The four of them flew in and arrived at the base of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. They also successfully met the other two empyrean heaven divine guards.</p><p>The other two people were a white-haired old man and a bald man in his forties.</p><p>The two of them exuded a powerful aura. One could tell that they were martial Kings with one look.</p><p>this bald man should be at the same level as Xu Zhong, a peak Lv 1 martial King realm. He’s the strongest among us!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“Brother Xu, you’ve finally come.”</p><p>When the bald man saw Xu Zhong, he laughed and cupped his hands.</p><p>“Brother Wang!”</p><p>Xu Zhong also cupped his fists.</p><p>The bald man’s gaze swept across Lu Ming and the rest, and his expression changed.</p><p>“Brother Xu, what happened? Why is there a half-step King realm kid following you?”</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>Xu Zhong laughed bitterly. I’m not happy with you, brother Wang. This little brother is also here to complete the mission.</p><p>“What? He’s also here to complete the mission? Are you kidding me? A mere half-step King is here to seek death. Don’t drag us down.”</p><p>The bald man shouted.</p><p>brother Wang is right. I told him to get the hell back to the hall of missions and cancel the mission, but he was so stubborn and insisted on following us. He’s the one who’s looking for death. We’ll just ignore him when the time comes!</p><p>Said Huang Jing coldly from the side.</p><p>forget it. If he wants to follow us, then let him. Anyway, we won’t have the energy to take care of him when the time comes.</p><p>The bald man said and did not look at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“They really look down on us!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. However, he also knew that it was normal for Kings to look down on martial artists below Kings. He could not be bothered with them and sat down on a stone bench at the side.</p><p>“Brother Wang, how’s the situation?”</p><p>Xu Zhong asked the bald man about the situation.</p><p>this time, the sky cloud sect and the illusionary sword sect were attacked. All the Warriors above the martial Grandmaster realm from the two sects have disappeared. Not even their bodies were left behind. I’ll take you to the two sects to take a look first and then I’ll tell you in detail.</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>“Alright, then we’ll set off immediately!”</p><p>Xu Zhong nodded.</p><p>The group of six headed towards sky cloud sect.</p><p>Sky cloud sect was built on a cluster of peaks.</p><p>The clouds were misty, and the peaks were surrounded by cranes. It was a magnificent scene, like a Fairyland.</p><p>Many palaces and pavilions were built on the peaks, and people were coming and going.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that sky cloud sect was at least ten times stronger than the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Thinking about it, with a martial King in charge, it was already equivalent to a medium-sized Empire. How could it not be strong?</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could not sense any powerful aura in this sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>A few beams of light flew out from sky cloud sect.</p><p>These were a few martial arts Grandmaster realm Warriors.</p><p>these martial arts grandmasters were not in the sect on the day of sky cloud sect’s incident. That’s why they managed to escape.</p><p>The bald man explained.</p><p>Soon, they appeared in front of the crowd.</p><p>“Junior greets senior Wang and senior Liu.”</p><p>The sky cloud sect grandmasters quickly saluted the bald man and the white-haired elder.</p><p>“En, these three are also King tiers from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.”</p><p>The bald man pointed at Xu Zhong and the other two, ignoring Lu Ming.</p><p>“Greetings, three seniors!”</p><p>The grandmasters from sky cloud sect saluted him respectfully, their hearts trembling.</p><p>To think that so many King tiers had come all of a sudden! This caused them to be extremely shocked.</p><p>alright, we’re going in to check it out now. You lead the way!</p><p>The bald man ordered.</p><p>“Alright, seniors, please!”</p><p>The leader of the sky cloud sect grandmasters was a refined middle-aged man. He greeted them respectfully. &Nbsp;</p><p>The group followed the middle-aged man and the rest as they flew into sky cloud sect.</p><p>this time, our sect was unlucky. We were suddenly attacked. All the powerhouses above the martial Grandmaster realm disappeared.</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man said with a sad expression.</p><p>moreover, the strangest thing is that according to the situation at the scene and the reactions of the disciples below the martial arts Grandmaster realm, the martial arts grandmasters did not make a single sound and just disappeared. Only the patriarch of our sect, where the martial King realm experts were in seclusion, made a shocking sound and left some traces at the scene.</p><p>The refined middle-aged man continued his introduction and led them to the place where the sky cloud sect’s patriarch was in seclusion.</p><p>It was a mountain peak full of spiritual Qi. However, at this time, the mountain peak almost collapsed. A deep crack appeared in the middle of the mountain peak. It was a blade mark that almost split the mountain peak in half.</p><p>Everyone flew down and observed carefully. They also found some marks that looked like they were whipped by iron chains.</p><p>“Traces of chains, what weapon is this?”</p><p>Xu Zhong frowned deeply.</p><p>based on this, the attacker must be a warrior king. Therefore, a warrior Ascendant can’t put up any resistance. However, the attacker can’t be too strong either. Otherwise, the sky cloud sect’s patriarch wouldn’t have had such a fierce fight with him.</p><p>Huang Jing analyzed.</p><p>but according to our disciples, the battle only took place for a very short period of time. It ended in less than a minute. After that, the old ancestor disappeared.</p><p>The elegant middle-aged man added.</p><p>yes, it’s very likely that the other side has more than one king.</p><p>Xu Zhong frowned and pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked around in detail.</p><p>“What can a half-step King see? He’s just putting on an act.”</p><p>Huang Jing coldly snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This woman was sick. She was always targeting him.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with this woman. He was busy observing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
