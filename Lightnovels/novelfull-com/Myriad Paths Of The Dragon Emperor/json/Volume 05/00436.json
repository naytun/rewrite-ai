He cleaned them up.</p><p>...</p><p>A day later, they were finally done.</p><p>The harvest this time was extremely terrifying. It was far beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>There were too many of them.</p><p>Most importantly, there were more than a thousand other storage rings in zang Sheng’s storage ring. All of them were obtained from killing other geniuses and had yet to be counted.</p><p>After counting, Lu Ming himself was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p>Spiritual crystals, all kinds of middle and upper spiritual crystals. If they were exchanged for lower spiritual crystals, they would be worth 50.6 billion.</p><p>Yes, more than 50 billion spiritual crystals. What a terrifying number!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled, and his eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>There were also some other materials, spirit weapons and the like not included.</p><p>hahaha, I’m rich. These spiritual crystals are enough for me to use for a while. If I can convert all these spiritual crystals into strength, my strength will increase by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Then, with a wave of his hand, two pitch-black branches appeared.</p><p>These two pitch-black branches were the two that had spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming only had one. The other one fell on autumn water’s hand.</p><p>However, he had killed li autumn water before, so this branch naturally fell into his hands.</p><p>“I don’t know what use it has!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and kept it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming got up and left the courtyard. He turned into a rainbow and flew into the distance.</p><p>The place he wanted to go to was one of the more famous places in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the mystical treasure house.</p><p>In the mystical Treasure Hall, you can exchange for all kinds of treasures and have sold all kinds of treasures.</p><p>The Qi Zhen house was extremely majestic. It was a few hundred meters tall and covered an area of a few thousand mu.</p><p>Inside, people came and went, and it was very lively.</p><p>“It’s so huge!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>In fact, every sect would build a facility like the mystical Treasure Hall so that their disciples could exchange for treasures.</p><p>The mystical sword sect had one as well, but it was many times smaller than the mystical treasure house in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>In the hall, people came and went. At a glance, there were no less than thousands of people.</p><p>“Eh? Look, who’s that?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming, the eastern sky Divine Guard this time!”</p><p>so he’s Lu Ming. He’s quite young!</p><p>Hmph, what eastern sky divine guards? he’s just lucky. There aren’t any decent Masters in the East, so he took over the eastern sky divine guards!</p><p>“That’s right, if we leave him in the South, he’ll be able to escape. He’s not even in the top five!”</p><p>just wait and see. The half-step King from the South has his eyes on the throne of the eastern sky divine guards. He’s been in seclusion for the past few days. When he comes out, he’ll definitely challenge Lu Ming. His position as the eastern sky Divine Guard won’t last long!</p><p>“That’s right. He’s not strong, but he has such good cultivation resources. Who would be convinced? Let’s wait for a good show!”</p><p>A series of discussions sounded in the surroundings.</p><p>Of course, most of them were the new Ditian divine guards that had joined this year.</p><p>There were also some Ditian divine guards from the previous batch who looked over curiously.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming heard it too. He sneered and could not be bothered with it. He walked to a room.</p><p>Inside the room was the place to buy and sell and Exchange items.</p><p>“Little brother, what do you need?”</p><p>An old man with a smile asked.</p><p>I want to exchange all the lower, middle, and upper spiritual crystals for Supreme spiritual crystals. Is that possible? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course you can, but you’ll have to pay a 1% fee!”</p><p>The old man replied with a smile.</p><p>He was not surprised. There were many people who came to exchange for top-grade spirit crystals every day.</p><p>When one’s cultivation reached the half-step King realm or even King realm, spirit crystals of other grades would be useless. Only Supreme-grade spirit crystals would have any effect.</p><p>Therefore, Warriors above the half-step King realm would exchange their spirit crystals for Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>“One percent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>“Young man, how many crystals do you have to exchange?”</p><p>The old man continued to ask with a smile.</p><p>yes, I have 50 billion lower spiritual crystals. I’ll exchange them all for Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, huh? What? 50 billion?”</p><p>The old man casually agreed, but the next moment, he reacted. The smile on his face froze, and his eyes widened.</p><p>Previously, he thought that Lu Ming was not very old and would not have many spiritual crystals to exchange for it. He did not expect Lu Ming to say such an astronomical figure.</p><p>“What’s wrong? I can’t exchange for it? Then I’ll exchange for less!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, no, I can exchange, I can exchange!”</p><p>The old man hurriedly called out. The smile on his face became even more brilliant.</p><p>Previously, his smile was just a professional habit. Now, his smile was completely sincere.</p><p>If he exchanged for 50 billion lower spiritual crystals, the fee would be as high as 500 million. He would be able to take a large amount of Commission from it.</p><p>How could he not be happy?</p><p>“Little brother, wait a moment!”</p><p>The old man ran out in a hurry and returned after a while with a storage ring in his hand.</p><p>young man, there are 50000 Supreme spiritual crystals in total. Please count them!</p><p>The old man passed the storage ring to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it. With a thought, a milky-white crystal appeared in his hand.</p><p>It was filled with extremely dense energy.</p><p>The spiritual Qi contained in the top-grade spiritual crystal was almost solid.</p><p>Ordinary martial artists could not refine it at all. Only half-step Kings and above could.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the ring with his mind and found that there were exactly 50000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals in the storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He waved his hand and a few storage rings appeared.</p><p>senior, there are middle spiritual crystals, upper spiritual crystals, and lower spiritual crystals in here. They add up to 50.5 billion. Please count them!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Good, good!”</p><p>The old man took the storage ring and began to count.</p><p>Lu Ming waited patiently.</p><p>The old man took a full two hours to finish counting.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s 50.5 billion!”</p><p>The old man nodded and put it away with a smile. He then asked, ” “Little brother, do you need anything else?”</p><p>senior, I have some spirit weapons, martial arts techniques, materials, and so on. Help me take a look and see how many top-grade spirit crystals I can exchange for them. I’ll exchange them all!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few more storage rings.</p><p>The old man took it and counted it carefully.</p><p>These items were worth about ten billion in the end. Lu Ming had an additional ten thousand pieces of Supreme-grade spirit crystals.</p><p>The old man laughed so hard that he couldn’t close his mouth.</p><p>senior, I need to buy a batch of half-step king beast cores. How many spirit crystals for one? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming intended to purchase a batch of demonic cores and rush his cultivation to the peak of the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm as soon as possible.</p><p>When one’s cultivation reached the peak of the 9th level of the martial ancestor realm, one could fully focus on comprehending ‘force’.</p><p>half-step king beast core, 100 Supreme grade spirit crystals for one. The old man said.</p><p>“It’s really expensive!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
