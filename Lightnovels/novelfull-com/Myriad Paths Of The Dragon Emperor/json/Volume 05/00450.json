He had the back of a Tiger and the waist of a bear. His body looked very strong. It was obvious that he had also seen Lu Ming. His eyes flashed as he continued to run and disappeared in front of him.</p><p>“Looking at his age, he’s most likely a Ditian Divine Guard from the previous batch!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This was the first time he had met anyone else after entering the hundred deities slope.</p><p>Those who could enter the hundred deities slope were definitely not simple. They were either geniuses or had a powerful backer.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and did not think too much about it. He continued to search while comprehending the three absolutes of the Dragon God.</p><p>Huhuhu ~</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming came to a desert with strong winds.</p><p>In this desert, the wind was strong and fierce. It whistled endlessly, bringing up sand and dust.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have essential Qi to protect his body. He could only channel the force of the wind to resist the strong wind around him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming heard the chirping of birds coming from the front.</p><p>“Bird chirping?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>The hundred gods slope could be said to be barren and deathly silent, so how could there be birds?</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He followed the sound and searched.</p><p>“That’s the Chi!”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming stopped and looked at the sky in shock.</p><p>A hundred meters up in the sky, there was a round bead. The bead was green and crystal clear, as if it was made of the most beautiful green jade.</p><p>On the surface of the Pearl, there was a small green bird. It flew around the Pearl and let out chirps.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the green bird was not a real bird, but an illusion of the bead.</p><p>“Could this Xun be the spirit of a spirit weapon? A spirit weapon giving birth to a weapon spirit, what grade was this spirit weapon? Moreover, the wind concept on it is so dense. This is definitely a supreme weapon. Hahaha, I’m rich, I’m rich!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>If he could obtain this kind of spirit weapon, it would have endless uses.</p><p>Lu Ming approached it carefully. He released the concept of wind from his body, trying to attract the bead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When Lu Ming got closer, the green bird noticed him. It let out a crisp chirping and sized him up with its big eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the concept of wind and approached the round pearl.</p><p>When the little bird came into contact with Lu Ming’s concept of wind, it had a friendly look in its eyes.</p><p>He seemed to enjoy the aura that Lu Ming exuded.</p><p>“Haha, there’s a chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He exerted more effort to cast the concept of wind.</p><p>“Brat, get lost! This bead is mine!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold shout was heard. A burly and tall young man strode over.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. This young man was the one he had met yesterday.</p><p>The burly young man’s eyes were filled with greed as he stared at the bead.</p><p>Immediately after, a concept of wind burst out from his body. The level of mastery was even higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>kid, disperse your wind concept and let me do it!</p><p>The burly young man rebuked with a commanding tone.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He could not be bothered with the other party and focused on controlling the concept of wind.</p><p>At that moment, the bird was basking in Lu Ming’s creation of wind. It seemed to be enjoying it. It flapped its wings and flew toward Lu Ming with the bead.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The little bird flew towards him, which meant that it had acknowledged him.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Seeing this, the burly young man shouted angrily, ” “This bead is mine. You want it? in your dreams!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful wind concept rushed toward the bead.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly teenager’s concept of wind collided with Lu Ming’s, creating a violent boom.</p><p>Lu Ming’s concept of wind trembled and dissipated with a bang.</p><p>The green bird seemed to be frightened. It shrieked, flapped its wings, and flew into the sky with the bead.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>The burly young man roared and bent his legs. The muscles in his body burst out, and his burly figure soared into the sky and grabbed the bead.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming roared madly. He stomped on the ground and his figure soared into the sky, rushing towards the round pearl.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The little bird shrieked and flapped its wings rapidly. Gusts of strong wind emerged. The little bird and the bead turned into a green light and rushed forward, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the burly teenager fell rapidly and landed on the desert, blasting two big pits in the desert.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>The bead that was about to be in his hand was destroyed by the burly young man just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was bleeding.</p><p>That bead was definitely not a trivial matter. It was a weapon used by an unparalleled expert who had cultivated the wind concept. If Lu Ming could get it and comprehend the wind concept on it, his wind concept would definitely advance by leaps and bounds. It was not impossible for him to condense an intent rune in a short time.</p><p>But now, it was all gone.</p><p>His killing intent towards the burly young man was obvious.</p><p>“Kid, what are you shouting for? I haven’t even questioned you yet. Kid, I told you to disperse your wind concept and let me do it, why didn’t you do as I said? Now that you’ve caused me to lose this Supreme treasure, tell me, how do you intend to compensate me for my loss?”</p><p>The burly young man glared at Lu Ming with an extremely gloomy expression, his killing intent flickering.</p><p>“Compensate you? Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he laughed.</p><p>He was the one who had discovered it and was about to get it, but it was destroyed by the burly young man. Now, the burly young man actually wanted him to compensate.</p><p>It was simply laughable!</p><p>“I’ll pay for your head, you idiot. Today, you must die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was menacing as he strode toward the burly teenager.</p><p>“Haha, you want to kill me? What a joke. This is the hundred deities slope, where cultivation is suppressed and physical body is superior. My physical body has already reached the upper tier of level five, surpassing some Kings. You want to kill me with just your abilities? You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The burly teenager laughed wildly. His muscles bulged as he took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. At the same time, he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch, aiming at the other party’s fist.</p><p>you still dare to compete with me? you’re looking for death! Shatter!</p><p>The burly young man revealed a ferocious smile.</p><p>He wanted to shatter Lu Ming’s fist with one punch and let him lie on the ground and wail.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two fists collided with each other.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>As the burly youth wished, the sound of bones breaking rang out.</p><p>However, the burly young man’s face no longer had any ferocity or excitement, only fear and disbelief.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Then, the burly young man let out a shrill scream.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
