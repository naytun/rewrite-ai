As long as we kill those corpse guards, the refined corpse is nothing to be afraid of!”</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Nonsense, who doesn’t know this logic, but there are so many refined corpses here, how can they kill the corpse guards? It’s really laughable. If you have the ability, go and kill them!”</p><p>Huang Jing looked at Lu Ming angrily and said contemptuously.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go kill them!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>Huang Jing, Xu Zhong, and the others were dumbstruck.</p><p>“Why did you go and kill them? Are you crazy? even if you want to die, you don’t have to drag us down.”</p><p>Huang Jing sneered. She did not believe Lu Ming’s words at all.</p><p>everyone, I’ll leave the rest of the refined corpses to you. I’ll take care of the peak Lv 1 martial King refined corpse and the corpse guards!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the corpse guard and the refined corpse, which were the last to appear.</p><p>Xu Zhong and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“This f * ck!”</p><p>Xu Zhong and the others hesitated.</p><p>“Just let him go. In any case, he can’t help much by staying here. Since he wants to die, why don’t we fulfill his wish?”</p><p>Huang Jing sneered.</p><p>“Shut up! If you continue to talk nonsense, be careful that I will cut You Down first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glared and a cold murderous intent flashed past.</p><p>Huang Jing’s face paled. For some unknown reason, her heart trembled.</p><p>hahaha, did you guys hear that? that half-step King trash is actually trying to kill us. Funny, this is too funny, this is the funniest joke I’ve ever heard in my life!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>The corpse guards revealed mocking smiles.</p><p>don’t waste your breath on them. Kill them and use their corpses to refine corpses. It’s just right!</p><p>kill! the last corpse guard shouted. Next to him, two refined corpses flew out, and a strong corpse Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>One of the two refined corpses was at the peak of the first level of the martial King realm, while the other was at the later stage. More than a dozen chains lashed out from the bodies of the two refined corpses and flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura completely exploded. His Blood Meridian burst out. At the same time, the three concepts of wind, fire, and Thunder Rose and a long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>He thrust his spear forward, and a three-colored true dragon roared as it pounced toward the two refined corpses.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion sounded out as the chains were knocked back. The three-colored true dragon didn’t stop and continued to attack the two refined corpses.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two refined corpses trembled violently and were sent flying hundreds of meters away.</p><p>The eyes of Xu Zhong, Huang Jing, and the rest were madly staring, almost bursting. Their mouths were wide open, and their faces were filled with dumbfoundedness.</p><p>With just one move, Lu Ming had repelled two refined corpses. One of them was even a refined corpse at the peak of the first level martial King realm.</p><p>How could Lu Ming have such powerful combat abilities?</p><p>More importantly, Lu Ming was only a demi King warrior. How could a demi King warrior defeat two such powerful refined corpses with one move?</p><p>They thought they were dreaming.</p><p>Especially Huang Jing, her face that could be considered pretty was filled with disbelief.</p><p>Previously, she had been ridiculing Lu Ming and was extremely contemptuous of him.</p><p>But now?</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was beyond her knowledge.</p><p>at such a young age, half-step King, spear in hand, and comprehended three intents … I think I already know who he is!</p><p>Xu Zhong murmured, but his face was filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“Who is it? Who is it?”</p><p>Huang Jing asked in a daze.</p><p>in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region, who else has such combat strength other than the new eastern sky Divine Guard, Lu Ming? ”</p><p>The bald man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Lu Ming! So it’s him, so it’s him, no wonder!”</p><p>Huang Jing was stunned at first. Soon after, she cried out in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name had spread to all the Emperor heaven divine guards in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region. There were not many Emperor heaven divine guards who had not heard of him.</p><p>The few people present had heard of Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>“You came here together, but you didn’t know that the other party is Lu Ming?”</p><p>The bald man was speechless.</p><p>“Ahem, I was going to ask, but I was interrupted!”</p><p>Xu Zhong coughed a few times.</p><p>Huang Jing’s face turned pale. She was the one who interrupted Lu Ming’s self-introduction earlier.</p><p>At that time, she had thought that there was no need to introduce him to a mere half-step King.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she felt a little panicked.</p><p>Lu Ming, the other party was actually Lu Ming.</p><p>He was a rare genius from the Eastern Region’s empyrean heaven divine Palace, a genius who had defeated a true king while only at the half-step King realm.</p><p>If she had known that the other party was Lu Ming, she would not have mocked him in that way.</p><p>Now, she was filled with regret.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was that possible? A mere half-step King.”</p><p>A corpse guard let out a shout of disbelief.</p><p>The other corpse guards also had similar expressions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and his aura was like a dragon. He waved the long spear and a mighty spear radiance burst out.</p><p>“Kill this brat!”</p><p>The last corpse guard shouted in anger.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two refined corpses waved their chains and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Those chains were extremely terrifying and could crush mountains.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, hundreds of small three-colored true dragons flew out. The two refined corpses were hit and retreated, even enveloping a few corpse guards.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s kill him together!”</p><p>The old corpse guard roared and wanted to control the corpse guards to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>block those corpse guards. Even if we have to risk our lives, we have to block them and buy time for Lu Ming!</p><p>Xu Zhong roared and pounced on a peak Lv 1 martial King realm refined corpse. He even enveloped a Lv 1 martial King realm refined corpse and pinned it down.</p><p>The bald burly man, Huang Jing, and the others all shouted and charged towards the refined corpses.</p><p>Lu Ming’s outburst had given them hope. At that moment, they naturally gave it their all.</p><p>For a time, this region was completely immersed in a great battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core burst forth and his long spear was like a dragon. The huge Spear’s radiance was like a mountain, completely suppressing the two refined corpses.</p><p>When Lu Ming fought Xue Chao back then, before the three intents of wind, fire, and Thunder had completely fused, Lu Ming’s combat strength was already on par with Xue Chao’s.</p><p>After that, the three types of intents were completely fused, and the power of the three intents increased by several times. Furthermore, the three absolutes of the Dragon God had evolved from a heaven-level low-grade martial arts technique to a heaven-level high-grade martial arts technique, and its power had increased greatly. Lu Ming’s combat strength had also increased greatly, and he easily crushed Xue Chao.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming’s vital essence had been converted to ninety-nine percent. At the same time, his comprehension of the Dragon God’s three absolutes had deepened day by day. Now, Lu Ming’s combat strength had completely surpassed an ordinary peak first tier martial King realm.</p><p>That was why Lu Ming could suppress the two refined corpses.</p><p>“Not good, let’s kill that brat together!”</p><p>That old corpse guard roared, extremely shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…</p><p>The four corpse guards exploded with corpse Qi and four claw lights clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, and the nine Dragon bloodline flew out. He opened his mouth and roared, and a terrifying devouring power burst out.</p><p>“My bloodline power!”</p><p>“My blood essence!”</p><p>Instantly, the four corpse guards cried out in alarm.</p><p>The power of his bloodline and blood essence trembled as they were devoured by the nine Dragon bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
