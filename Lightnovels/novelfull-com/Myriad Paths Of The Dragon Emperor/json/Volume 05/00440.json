It was as cold as a knife.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stood up. His body trembled and he floated like a ghost, as light as a feather.</p><p>After a long time, he stopped in place.</p><p>“The force of wind has finally reached perfection!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely bright.</p><p>His Wind and Fire Force was already at the limit of the major achievement realm. After seven days of comprehension in the Dao enlightenment Palace, he had finally reached the Great Perfection realm.</p><p>However, it also showed that the Dao enlightenment Palace was indeed wonderful. In just seven days, it could help Lu Ming break through.</p><p>now, I’ll begin to comprehend the force of fire!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and continued to comprehend the force of fire.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed. Lu Ming’s power of fire had also reached the perfect stage.</p><p>In just half a month, Lu Ming’s Wind and Fire Force had all reached the perfect stage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and gathered the power of wind and Fire. With a slight shake, the space rumbled and a spear ray burst out, flying to an unknown distance.</p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. His Wind and Fire Force had reached perfection. Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>There was a huge difference between the perfection and the completion of force. The difference was several times. After the fusion of Wind and Fire Force, its power was even more powerful.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s combat strength was infinitely close to that of a level Seven genius.</p><p>That’s right. Initially, Lu Ming had already reached level six. Now, he was infinitely close to Level Seven.</p><p>“I’ve set a month’s time. There’s still half a month left, just enough time to cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>With both forces at the peak, he could already cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the second level.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming continued his closed-door cultivation and devoted himself to cultivating the Dragon God’s three absolutes.</p><p>In the Dao enlightenment Palace, he combined the Wind and Fire intents to cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes. His speed was terrifyingly fast.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the second stage. This caused his combat strength to skyrocket once again, and he was now a level Seven genius.</p><p>these spiritual crystals were so worth it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>At this time, the one-month period was almost up. Lu Ming left the Dao enlightenment Palace and flew towards the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the eastern sky courtyard. He used the divine Guard token to activate the inscription formation and walked in.</p><p>He didn’t notice that in the distant sky, a young man was watching him enter.</p><p>Lu Ming has finally finished cultivating and returned. I’ll report to senior brother Cai Gou immediately.</p><p>The young man muttered. With a flash, he flew towards one of the courtyards of the Ditian Divine Guard.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the courtyard and sat on a stone chair in the pavilion in the courtyard. He poured himself a glass of wine and sipped it slowly while admiring the flowing water under the small bridge.</p><p>He had been in seclusion for more than a month. It was time for him to relax a little.</p><p>“May I know where Senior Sister Mu Lan is? If she’s here, she should have heard the news that I’ve become a Divine Guard of the East heaven and will come to find me. It seems that I have to find some time to inquire about it!”</p><p>“I wonder how the war is going in the burning sun Empire? I’m sure the results of the Emperor sky Divine Guard selection have already been sent back to the blazing sun Empire. Now that I’ve become the eastern sky Divine Guard, Qiu changkong shouldn’t dare to act rashly. The war in the blazing sun Empire shouldn’t have too many changes in the short term.”</p><p>“The most troublesome thing is his master. I wonder which great figure in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace is Qiu changkong’s master?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered as he drank.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar came like a storm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly shot out two long beams of light that flickered.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Then, he poured himself a full cup of wine and drank it in one gulp. He stood up and strode out.</p><p>Walking out of the courtyard, he saw a young man in his mid-twenties standing in the air, staring at the eastern sky courtyard with burning eyes.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, the young man’s eyes lit up and he shouted, ” “Lu Ming, you’ve been hiding like a turtle for more than a month, and you’ve finally shown yourself. Lu Ming, I’m too lazy to waste my breath on you. The throne of the eastern sky divine guards is not for you. You’re not qualified. Now, give it to me, or you’ll only humiliate yourself!”</p><p>The young man shouted as soon as he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Earlier, the young man had shouted so loudly that he had long alarmed the other Ditian divine guards on the mountain peak. At this moment, one figure after another flew out from the courtyards and stood in the air, looking over.</p><p>it’s Cai Gou. Cai Gou is finally going to challenge Lu Ming!</p><p>Cai Gou is a half-step void God Realm. He was defeated in the battle of the Nantian divine guards. His combat strength is extremely terrifying. Lu Ming is in danger!</p><p>this time, there were not many masters in the East, not even a half step King. Lu Ming was only able to get the throne of the eastern sky divine guards by pure luck!</p><p>that’s right. The four divine guards are for the capable. It’s only right for Cai Gou to challenge him and take the throne of the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>The surrounding Ditian divine guards discussed animatedly.</p><p>Qiu changkong, zang Sheng, also appeared in the crowd.</p><p>After more than a month, their injuries had healed, and they were gloating at the misfortune they had caused.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, so what if you’ve taken over the eastern sky divine guards? Wouldn’t it still be snatched away? Hahaha!”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed in his heart.</p><p>“I didn’t expect the other three directions to be so powerful. It’s a good thing I didn’t get the eastern sky divine guards. Otherwise, it would be taken away before I could even get a seat. Hahaha!”</p><p>Zang Sheng was also laughing coldly.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally heard the others ‘discussion. He asked on purpose.</p><p>my name is Cai Gou. Lu Ming, I advise you to quit the eastern sky divine guards on your own!</p><p>Cai Gou said.</p><p>“As expected, you’re a good dog. I say, you came to my place just for such a small matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>The others looked at each other.</p><p>Cai Gou’s eyes turned red, and a cold killing intent burst out. His face was twisted as he roared, ” “Lu Ming, you little b * stard, what did you say? You’re looking for death, you’re looking for death. I was going to let you go, but now, you’re dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to call him a dog in public. He deserved to die.</p><p>“You’re just a dog. Don’t bark so loudly. You just want to challenge me, don’t you? Fine, I agree to fight with you. Tomorrow morning, we’ll fight on the divine Guard battle platform!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly. His voice was clear and loud, and it spread far and wide.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. They did not expect Lu Ming to agree so easily.</p><p>Cai Gou was also stunned for a moment. Then, he revealed a cold and vicious smile and said, ” “Alright, little bastard, I’ll let you live for one more day!”</p><p>“Then get lost, you dog!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Cai Gou gritted his teeth so hard that he almost suffered internal injuries.</p><p>Hmph, now you’re going to talk. Tomorrow, tomorrow I’ll make you cry!</p><p>Cai Gou gritted his teeth and turned to leave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
