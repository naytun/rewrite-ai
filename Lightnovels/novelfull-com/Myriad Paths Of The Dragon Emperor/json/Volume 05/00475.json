The Thunder concept runes became even more crystalline and dazzling.</p><p>However, the refined corpses were in a much worse state.</p><p>The refined corpse was originally an evil thing. It was most afraid of things of extreme yang like lightning and fire, let alone the lightning tribulation, which was its nemesis.</p><p>After the first wave of lightning tribulation, at least twenty refined corpses were turned into charcoal. When the cold wind blew, they turned into dust and dissipated.</p><p>damn it, damn it! Little bastard, there are only three waves of tribulation lightning. Once the three waves are over, I’ll tear you to pieces!</p><p>The cold voice roared, full of heartache.</p><p>It was obvious that these refined corpses were the corpses of the martial ancestor realm and above experts that they had killed from the illusionary sword sect and the other two sects. He had set up the ten thousand corpse array to refine an extremely powerful refined corpse.</p><p>But now, more than twenty refined corpses had been destroyed, and the ten thousand corpse array had been broken. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed to the other side.</p><p>There was also a pile of refined corpses here.</p><p>The voice roared again and again, but there was nothing it could do.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Dozens of lightning bolts struck again. This time, the power of the lightning bolts was stronger than the last.</p><p>Half of it was still aimed at Lu Ming, while the other half was aimed at the refined corpses.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. He did not make a move to resist the lightning. He only controlled the concept runes to resist with all his might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>One after another, dazzling Thunderbolts continuously struck the intent runes. Every time they struck, the intent runes would tremble as if they were about to collapse. However, in the next moment, they withstood it again and became even more solid.</p><p>After the lightning, the intent runes still didn’t dissipate. They were crystal clear and had the color of purple jade.</p><p>On the side, dozens of refined corpses were turned into charcoal.</p><p>“Little bastard, little bastard, now that the three waves of lightning have passed, go to hell!”</p><p>The cold voice rang out.</p><p>At the same time, the sound of the air being torn could be heard as the refined corpses pounced towards Lu Ming. Among the refined corpses, Lu Ming saw a young man in a black robe.</p><p>This young man looked to be around 25 or 26 years old. His face was pale and bloodless, and his eyes were long and narrow, filled with a cold light.</p><p>“Little bastard, I’m going to refine you into a refined corpse, my puppet, and fight for me for the rest of my life!”</p><p>The young man said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m afraid you won’t have the chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile. Then, he took a step forward and rushed toward the black-robed young man and the pile of refined corpses.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled. A terrifying pressure spread and seemed to be stronger than before.</p><p>“Ah? What was going on? Why is your lightning tribulation still not over after three rounds? No, no, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The black-robed youth’s expression changed drastically. He screamed and retreated.</p><p>However, it was too late for the refined corpses to retreat.</p><p>With a loud bang, dozens of lightning bolts fell from the sky, even more powerful than before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and unusually determined. He still did not make a move to block it. He used the concept runes to block it.</p><p>The intent runes trembled violently like a candle Flame in the Wind. It seemed as if it would be extinguished at any moment, but it persevered.</p><p>“Eh? The intent runes have actually grown longer!”</p><p>After the lightning, Lu Ming was surprised to find that the Thunder concept rune had grown longer.</p><p>At first, it was an inch, but now it had grown a little.</p><p>Usually, a newly condensed intent rune would be a level-one intent rune.</p><p>Level-one intent talismans were further divided into beginner, small success, large success, and perfection.</p><p>The average martial King realm martial artist had comprehended level one intent realm.</p><p>The four levels corresponded to the four levels of the martial King realm.</p><p>Low-tier Kings usually comprehended intent runes at the beginning of the first level, and the length of intent runes was about an inch longer.</p><p>The intent runes comprehended by lower tier Kings were at the first level lower tier and two inches long.</p><p>And so on.</p><p>In order to break through to the martial King realm, one’s intent must first break through before one’s cultivation could.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had yet to break through to the martial King realm, but his intent rune was already more than an inch long. This was extremely rare.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This was a good thing.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed, but the black-robed young man was roaring in anger.</p><p>The wave of lightning just now had turned a large pile of refined corpses into charcoal. At a glance, there were at least fifty of them.</p><p>The main thing was that the refined corpses had been too concentrated and had been wiped out all at once.</p><p>“My refined corpse!”</p><p>The black-robed young man screamed as his heart was bleeding.</p><p>“Don’t worry, there’s more, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and rushed to the other refined corpses.</p><p>In the sky, another wave of lightning struck down.</p><p>The fifth wave!</p><p>Usually, when a martial artist broke through to the martial King realm, there would only be three waves of lightning punishment. However, there was actually a fifth wave of Lu Ming’s lightning punishment.</p><p>The black-robed youth wanted to cry.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>After another round of lightning strikes, a large number of refined corpses were turned into charcoal.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he made it through in the end. The concept rune grew a little longer and was approaching two inches in length.</p><p>“You’re a pervert, a monster!”</p><p>The black-robed youth roared.</p><p>He was extremely agitated. His cultivation had reached Lv 3 martial King realm and he was extremely powerful. Under normal circumstances, he was confident that he could kill Lu Ming with a single palm strike. However, he did not dare to make a move now.</p><p>He was afraid that the moment he attacked, the lightning tribulation would envelop him and take him in with him.</p><p>He roared in his heart. As long as Lu Ming was done with his tribulation, he would have a hundred vicious ways to deal with him.</p><p>“Scolding me? Then let’s do it together!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He suddenly took a step forward and rushed toward the black-robed young man.</p><p>“Little bastard, what are you doing?”</p><p>The black-robed youth was shocked and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took two steps. His figure suddenly disappeared and in the next moment, he appeared not far away from the black-robed young man.</p><p>The cloud of lightning tribulation appeared above Lu Ming’s head in an instant.</p><p>This time, it directly enveloped the black-robed young man.</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>The black-robed young man’s expression changed drastically as he screamed madly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>What responded to him was a sky full of lightning.</p><p>This time, more than 100 lightning bolts struck down.</p><p>Most of them were aimed at the black-robed young man. Moreover, each bolt of lightning was more than ten times stronger than the one that was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed young man shouted madly as he tried his best to resist.</p><p>However, when the lightning bolts struck, the black-robed young man was still badly burnt and gray mist kept coming out of his body.</p><p>It was all corpse Qi, scattered by the lightning. The black-robed young man spurted out blood and wailed.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not simply use the concept runes to block. Instead, he held the long spear and soared into the sky, blocking half of the lightning.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Bolts of lightning fell on his body. Lu Ming felt numb all over and his muscles kept squirming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
