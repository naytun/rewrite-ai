It’s really unwise. It seems like I don’t have to do anything. You’re going to die in Cai Gou’s hands!”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed coldly before turning to leave as well.</p><p>After that, the news of the battle between Lu Ming and Cai Gou spread like wildfire.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and entered the eastern sky courtyard. He began to meditate and regulate his breathing.</p><p>The sun set and rose again, and a day had passed.</p><p>The divine Guard battle stage was built on a mountain peak. The peak of this mountain was relatively wide and flat, and there was a battle stage that was ten miles wide and wide.</p><p>As the name suggested, this was for duels between Ditian divine guards.</p><p>The fighting ring was made of black metal and was covered with inscriptions. Even a low-tier King wouldn’t be able to break it.</p><p>On the divine Guard battle platform, life and death were not to be disregarded.</p><p>Early in the morning, the divine guards ‘battle stage was already surrounded by people.</p><p>There were at least 10000 of them.</p><p>This time, there were about six to seven thousand new Ditian divine guards in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region. It could be said that other than those who were in closed-door cultivation or had important matters to attend to, the majority of them had come.</p><p>In fact, some of the previous Ditian divine guards had also come to the scene after receiving the news.</p><p>After all, it was related to the succession of the eastern sky divine guards, so it naturally received attention.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A figure flew through the air and landed on the divine Guard fighting ring.</p><p>“Cai Gou has arrived!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The moment Cai Gou landed on the fighting ring, he crossed his arms and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, another figure appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming is here too!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect him to really dare to come!”</p><p>there’s nothing we can do if he doesn’t come. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace has a rule that the four heavens divine guards can be obtained by challenging others, and they can’t avoid the battle. If he doesn’t come and avoids the battle, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace will also strip him of his position as the eastern heavens Divine Guard!</p><p>Lu Ming’s arrival caused a heated discussion.</p><p>Cai Gou opened his eyes as well, and a thick killing intent burst out from his eyes. He said coldly, ” “Lu Ming, if you have any last words, leave them behind. You won’t have the chance later!”</p><p>“This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? I hope you won’t regret it when the time comes!”</p><p>Cai Gou laughed coldly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>half a time is related to the succession of the eastern sky divine guards. I’ll be the witness. The winner will be the eastern sky divine guards. What else do you have to say? ”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Cai Gou shook their heads.</p><p>With the middle-aged man’s announcement, the atmosphere became even more lively.</p><p>“Who do you guys think will win? Does Lu Ming have a chance to win?”</p><p>“Impossible? “I don’t deny that Lu Ming’s talent is indeed terrifying, but his cultivation level is too low. When he took over the East sky divine guards, he was only at the peak of the eighth level martial Grandmaster realm. Only a month has passed since then. Even if he breaks through to the ninth level martial Grandmaster realm, or even the peak of the ninth level martial Grandmaster realm, he can’t possibly be Cai Gou’s match. Moreover, it’s impossible to break through from the peak of the eighth level martial Grandmaster realm to the peak of the ninth level martial Grandmaster realm in a month.”</p><p>a half step King is much stronger than a peak ninth grade martial ancestor realm. He’s two whole levels stronger. Moreover, Cai Gou himself is an expert between level four and level five. Adding them up, Cai Gou is more than six levels stronger than an average peak ninth grade martial ancestor realm. Lu Ming can’t possibly be his match!</p><p>for a genius like Cai Gou, when he’s at the half-step King realm, unless it’s a battle at the same cultivation level, no one can beat him!</p><p>“In that case, Lu Ming doesn’t stand a chance?”</p><p>“Lu Ming can’t possibly win!”</p><p>The person who spoke the last sentence was a cold-looking young man in a golden robe.</p><p>This person’s words attracted countless gazes.</p><p>This was because this person was another of the four divine guards, Zhong Hao of the southern Divine Guard.</p><p>Cai Gou is not weak. Even if it’s me, it won’t be easy to defeat him. It’s impossible for Lu Ming to defeat Cai Gou!</p><p>Zhong Hao said firmly. His cold expression was filled with confidence.</p><p>“Brother Zhong is right!”</p><p>Not far away, another beautiful woman laughed.</p><p>This beautiful woman was the northern heaven Divine Guard of the four divine guards.</p><p>Then, everyone’s eyes turned to the other side. There was a young man in a white robe. He was as handsome as Jade.</p><p>The most peculiar thing about him was that there was a sword-shaped mark between his eyebrows, which made him look even more mysterious.</p><p>There wasn’t a single person beside him. They seemed to be afraid of this person and kept their distance.</p><p>This man was the last of the four divine guards, the divine Guard of the Western Paradise.</p><p>At the same time, he was also known as the strongest person among the four divine guards.</p><p>When he was fighting for the Western Kingdom divine guards, the other half-step King didn’t even last three moves against him. This showed how terrifying he was.</p><p>Everyone looked at him, wanting to hear his opinion, but he did not say a word.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, two powerful auras shot up into the sky from the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming and Cai Gou were about to take action.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>die! Cai Gou shouted coldly as a long and thin green sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The green long sword let out a soft cry and instantly crossed the distance of hundreds of meters, stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The speed was so fast that many people present could not see the sword’s trajectory clearly.</p><p>Intent. It was obvious that Cai Gou had already comprehended a trace of the concept of wind on the basis of wind force.</p><p>Even if it was just a trace of the creation of wind, it was enough to make Cai Gou’s combat strength increase rapidly.</p><p>“Wind and Fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and thrust it forward. On the long spear, the power of wind and Fire was condensed to perfection.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>The tip of the spear and the tip of the sword collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The violent genuine Qi, the power of wind and Fire, filled the entire fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, the two figures retreated rapidly, each retreating several miles, and then stood still.</p><p>Everyone present was stunned and their eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming, he managed to block Cai Gou’s wind concept attack. How is that possible? ”</p><p>“Did you guys see that? Lu Ming’s cultivation has already reached the peak of the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm. What a terrifying cultivation speed!”</p><p>that’s not the main point. Both of them did not use any martial arts techniques just now. They were only testing the waters with their attacks. How could Lu Ming possibly block Cai Gou’s concept of wind? ”</p><p>force can actually block intent. How is this possible? ”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion and were extremely shocked.</p><p>“This is the power of wind and Fire!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and cold voice sounded.</p><p>Everyone was shocked, because the person who spoke was actually the divine Guard of the Western Paradise, Sheng Wushuang, who had not spoken before.</p><p>“Lu Ming has comprehended two types of impose. Furthermore, the two types of impose have been fused and have reached perfection!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang said slowly. However, he did not sound serious. He was just stating a fact as if Lu Ming was not worthy of his attention.</p><p>“The fusion of Wind and Fire? No wonder, no wonder. This Lu Ming is also impressive. He actually comprehended two types of force and even fused them successfully. The most shocking thing is that he actually cultivated both to perfection!”</p><p>Many people were amazed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
