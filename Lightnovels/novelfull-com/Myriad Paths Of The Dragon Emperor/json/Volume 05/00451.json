The fist did not shatter Lu Ming but he himself.</p><p>“Now, go to hell!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he strode toward the burly young man.</p><p>“Ah, what are you doing? What are you doing?”</p><p>The burly young man shouted like a frightened little girl, without any of his previous arrogance.</p><p>At that moment, there was only fear in his heart. The strength of Lu Ming’s physical body had exceeded his imagination. It was definitely above rank-6.</p><p>His physical body had reached the sixth grade even before he reached the martial King realm. How did he cultivate?</p><p>“What are you doing? Did you not hear that? I’ll send you on your way.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was like the snow in winter, bone-chilling.</p><p>no, you can’t kill me. I’m the son of the wind Palace’s Guardian. If you kill me, my father will definitely not let you off.</p><p>The burly young man roared.</p><p>“Hehe, there’s only the two of us here. How would your father know if I kill you? From the moment you tried to seize the bead, your fate has already been decided. Die!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch.</p><p>The physical body of a upper-tier rank-6 was extremely powerful. With a punch, the air trembled like a falling meteorite, bringing with it a terrifying force as it headed toward the burly young man.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>The burly teenager roared but it was impossible for him to avoid it. He could only wave his other fist in an attempt to block Lu Ming.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>When the two fists collided, the burly young man’s other fist also exploded like tofu.</p><p>“Ah, ah, my hand, my hand!”</p><p>The burly young man let out an extremely shrill scream. His facial features were completely twisted together, and tears and snot were flowing down his face.</p><p>His entire body was trembling, his legs were trembling, and his crotch was wet. He had peed himself out of fear.</p><p>Regret, extreme regret. If he had known this would be the result, he would not have taken the bead.</p><p>Initially, he thought that he could suppress Lu Ming with his fifth-stage physical body.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful.</p><p>don’t kill me, don’t kill me, don’t kill me, I know my mistake, I know my mistake!</p><p>The burly young man staggered backward and begged.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying fist force hit his chest. The violent fist force directly penetrated his body and shattered his heart.</p><p>The burly young man’s eyes instantly popped out, and blood kept coming out of his mouth. His face was full of regret, and the next moment, he died.</p><p>Lu Ming swiped his hand and removed the burly teenager’s storage ring.</p><p>what bad luck. I’ve run into this guy and let a peerless treasure escape. No, I have to continue chasing. Maybe I can catch up.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming took a step that covered dozens of meters and chased in the direction that the round bead had flown in at top speed.</p><p>This chase went on for thousands of miles.</p><p>However, there was still no trace of the bead.</p><p>“Hey, my precious pearl!”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to roar.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming was unwilling to give up. He gritted his teeth and continued to chase.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming stopped before he was a hundred miles away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>??…</p><p>Deafening rumbles sounded in front of them. Endless lightning flashed as if it wanted to destroy the world.</p><p>There was an ocean of thunder and lightning. The endless thunder and lightning flashed everywhere like lightning snakes. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>There was an ancient cauldron floating in the air. It was as large as a mountain, and it was the source of the boundless lightning.</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds filled the air. Between the dark clouds, there was actually a pool. In the pool, water was constantly flowing down.</p><p>The strange thing was that the water was blood-red in color. Like the water of the ocean, it flowed towards the huge cauldron.</p><p>The huge cauldron kept sending out lightning bolts, bombarding the blood-red water flow. However, it was useless. The blood-red water flow kept hitting the huge cauldron, causing it to rumble and shake. The lightning on the cauldron’s body was decreasing, and its light was dimming.</p><p>tribulation transcendence, it’s tribulation transcendence! This huge cauldron is actually tribulation transcendence!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not know what kind of tribulation the pool in the sky was, he was sure that it was a kind of Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>There were many types of heavenly tribulations. Lu Ming only knew a few common ones.</p><p>Lu Ming found it unbelievable that a huge cauldron was actually undergoing a tribulation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The pool in the sky tilted slightly, and endless blood-colored water poured down like a vast ocean. The sky rumbled as it pressed down on the giant cauldron.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The giant cauldron shook, and a bolt of lightning thicker than a bucket burst out from its body, trying to repel the blood-colored water flow.</p><p>Unfortunately, although the power of the lightning was extremely terrifying, the blood-colored water flow seemed to restrain it. The lightning had no effect on the blood-colored water flow.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The blood-colored water stream kept hitting the cauldron, and the huge cauldron kept shaking as if it couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>“This huge cauldron is definitely a Supreme treasure, just like that bead. If I can get it, I’ll be rich. Unfortunately, the heavenly Tribulation is too terrifying. If I go in, I’ll probably be washed away by the blood-red water, and not even a residue will be left.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly. He could only stare and feel anxious.</p><p>At this moment, the cauldron began to shake even more violently, and the lightning it was emitting was getting lesser and lesser. It seemed like it could no longer hold on.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The stone egg that had been hanging on Lu Ming’s hair suddenly flew out. It emitted a bright light and rushed towards the pool in the sky.</p><p>In the process of flying, the stone egg actually became bigger and bigger. In the end, it became bigger than a mountain. A crack actually appeared on the eggshell. It was like a big mouth that bit towards the pool.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The pool seemed to have been disturbed. It shook slightly, and the world rumbled. An infinite amount of blood rushed out of the pool and rushed toward the stone egg.</p><p>However, the stone egg glowed, and it was completely fearless. It rushed over and appeared above the pool.</p><p>The next moment, the stone egg bit down.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Half of the pond was directly bitten off. At this moment, the entire heaven and earth shook violently as if the heavens were angry and were about to face the end of the world.</p><p>However, the next moment …</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone egg opened its mouth and bit, swallowing the remaining half of the pool.</p><p>The world suddenly became calm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone egg glowed and shrunk rapidly. It flew back to Lu Ming’s hair and hung on it as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He stood there in a daze and only reacted after a long while.</p><p>“Nest, this … What the hell was this? It even swallowed the pool of water where the heavenly Tribulation manifested. Isn’t this too heaven-defying?”</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes and muttered to himself.</p><p>Although he knew that dandan was extraordinary, this was indeed shocking.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the huge cauldron made a sound and its body shrank rapidly. After a while, it became the size of a fist and flew toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
