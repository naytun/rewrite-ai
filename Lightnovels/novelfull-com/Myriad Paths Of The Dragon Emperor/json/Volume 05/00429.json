I almost fell asleep.”</p><p>...</p><p>At the side of the fighting ring, Lu Ming stood up slowly. He waved his hand and kept his chair. Then, he walked towards the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>The others were already speechless.</p><p>Qiu changkong and bury life’s battle had clearly ended in a few moves and did not take much time. However, Lu Ming said that he was about to fall asleep. This was obviously infuriating.</p><p>Especially those young geniuses who lost, they were even more annoyed.</p><p>I’m actually ranked after this guy. I’m really unwilling.</p><p>that’s right. This guy is purely relying on luck. If I meet him, I’ll take care of him in three moves.</p><p>A few geniuses from the Super regions gritted their teeth and discussed.</p><p>They didn’t lower their voices, and their voices spread far and wide, being heard by many people.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming had heard it too.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled for no reason. He went to the center of the fighting ring and stood in a triangular formation with Qiu changkong and zang Sheng.</p><p>this guy is too much of a hindrance. Let me deal with him first!</p><p>A cold glint flashed in zang Sheng’s eyes. A powerful aura erupted from his body and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu changkong unsheathed his sword and cut off the aura of death. He said coldly, ” “He’s mine, zang Sheng. I’ll deal with him first, then I’ll fight you.”</p><p>“Yours? Why? I’ve been unhappy with this kid for a long time. This time, I must finish him off. Qiu changkong, don’t worry, I won’t make you wait too long. I can finish him off in two moves.”</p><p>Zang Sheng said coldly.</p><p>“No, Lu Ming is mine!”</p><p>Qiu changkong didn’t yield an inch.</p><p>The audience was stunned for a moment, then they sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming is done for. Both burial and Qiu changkong have their eyes on him.”</p><p>“Could it be that this fellow has a grudge against Qiu changkong and zang Sheng?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>“If I were Lu Ming, I would admit defeat immediately. Otherwise, I’ll be in trouble.”</p><p>“I bet that he’s going to admit defeat. Otherwise, I’ll strip naked and run one round on the spot.”</p><p>“Nest, it’s you again. Weren’t you deaf just now? Why did you come back?”</p><p>nonsense. Such an exciting battle only happens once every five years. How could I miss it? ”</p><p>“This time, you said you’re not allowed to go back on your word.”</p><p>“I won’t cheat!”</p><p>Reserve Ditian divine guards and Ditian Divine Guard area.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, Jiang hongwen, and the others were all worried.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you going to admit defeat?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun muttered.</p><p>Based on his understanding of Lu Ming, he felt that Lu Ming would not admit defeat. Even if he was no match for him, he would still fight.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the stage, two auras burst out and clashed. They were Qiu changkong and zang Sheng.</p><p>“Zang Sheng, Lu Ming and I came from the same country and we have a grudge. This time, let me have him.”</p><p>Qiu changkong stared at zang Sheng.</p><p>“A grudge with you? hehe, let me tell you, he also has a grudge with me. I must deal with him myself!”</p><p>Burial said.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>These two fellows were treating him like air, like a dough that could be kneaded at will.</p><p>Since this was the case …</p><p>you two, you’re so full of nonsense. Are you done? if you’re done, then attack me together. I’m too lazy to deal with you one by one!</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard, but it swept through the entire scene like a storm.</p><p>Everyone in the area was petrified.</p><p>They only widened their eyes and stared at the fighting ring.</p><p>After a long time, there was a shocking uproar.</p><p>“What did Lu Ming say? What does he mean by that?”</p><p>he’s going to challenge Qiu changkong and zang Sheng at the same time. He’s crazy! He’s crazy!</p><p>“Don’t tell me he’s out of his mind after getting the bye card three times in a row? To challenge both Qiu changkong and zang Sheng at the same time, he’s definitely looking for a beating.”</p><p>I know. He knows that no one is allowed to kill in this battle. He wants to use this to create a commotion and gain some fame. Even if he’s beaten half to death, he won’t really die.</p><p>“That makes sense, that makes sense.”</p><p>“Hey, didn’t you say that if Lu Ming doesn’t admit defeat, you will strip naked and run one round now? now, quick! Don’t go back on your word.”</p><p>“Argh! Oh no, oh no, I’m blind, I can’t see. Oh no, I’m going to find an inscriber to take a look.”</p><p>After that, the man quickly slipped away.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t really leave. Instead, he hid in a corner and watched the fighting ring. He didn’t want to miss such an exciting event.</p><p>“Nest, I knew he was going to cheat.”</p><p>Even Lu Xiu, Jian Fengyun, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s way of doing things is indeed unexpected!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun sighed.</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming would not admit defeat and would accept the challenge. Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that Lu Ming would challenge Qiu changkong and burial at the same time.</p><p>In the sky, the middle-aged Guardian was also extremely shocked. He looked at Lu Ming with great curiosity.</p><p>As for Qiu changkong and zang Sheng, they were completely stunned.</p><p>The two of them were dumbfounded and thought they had heard wrong.</p><p>“What? what did you say?”</p><p>Zang Sheng repeated.</p><p>“Are you deaf? I told the two of you to come at me together. Stop wasting my time here.”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Qiu changkong suddenly burst out in laughter.”Lu Ming, do you think it’s useful to go all out? Do you want to use the rules that can’t take your life to show your pride and courage? Alright, I’ll break all the bones in your body in a moment. Let’s see how you’re going to show your pride and courage!”</p><p>Qiu changkong also felt that Lu Ming was using the rule that no one was allowed to harm others ‘lives to show off himself.</p><p>However, he could not harm Lu Ming’s life. Qiu changkong had plenty of ways to make Lu Ming miserable.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, I’m afraid that you’ll admit defeat when the time comes.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“I admit defeat. Haha, do you think I’ll admit defeat? Don’t worry, if I admit defeat, I’ll quit the Ditian divine guards from now on!”</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly laughed.</p><p>“Guardian, is Lu Ming’s request feasible?”</p><p>At that moment, zang Sheng looked at the middle-aged protector.</p><p>“Sure. The rules of the competition didn’t say that one person can’t challenge two people.”</p><p>The middle-aged protector nodded.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Zang Sheng looked at Lu Ming and said coldly, Qiu changkong, since he’s asking for death, let’s fulfill his request. Break all the bones in his body before he admits defeat. I’ll take the left side and you’ll take the right. We’ll fight again after we’ve dealt with him!</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s expression was malevolent.</p><p>“Are you done discussing? if you’re done, then make your move!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, he stomped on Qiu changkong’s face.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>His speed was unbelievably fast. As he took a step forward, the entire world rumbled. A terrifying pressure pressed down on Qiu changkong.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Qiu changkong was shocked. He had never expected Lu Ming to attack just like that. Moreover, the power of that kick was too terrifying.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qiu changkong let out a long howl. Dazzling lightning power burst out from his body, forming a ball of lightning in front of him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
