Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>On the door of the courtyard, there were a few words: East heaven courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and a purple-gold token appeared. It was his Divine Guard token.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming injected essential Qi into the divine Guard token. The token glowed with rays of light that extended to the courtyard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The courtyard trembled and a light screen appeared. This light screen enveloped the entire courtyard.</p><p>At this moment, the light screen in front of the gate split into two.</p><p>“Not bad! Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied. In this way, he would not have to be afraid of others prying into his cultivation or his secrets in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in and the light screen closed automatically.</p><p>In the courtyard, there was a small bridge, a flowing water, a Pavilion, two rooms, and a living room.</p><p>The courtyard was filled with a dense aura.</p><p>Spiritual Qi. This fog was actually formed by the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth. The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth had actually turned into a physical form. It could be seen how rich the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was here.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and felt that there was an endless amount of spiritual energy that was constantly surging out from the courtyard.</p><p>the spiritual spring’s eye is indeed wonderful. Let’s cultivate then!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat down cross-legged and condensed his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline roared and inhaled. A terrifying devouring power burst out.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The rich spiritual energy in the world was gathering towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The boundless spiritual energy of heaven and earth was devoured by the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and turned into Lu Ming’s essential Qi.</p><p>The essential Qi that was condensed from the spirit Qi of heaven and earth was extremely pure. It continuously gathered with Lu Ming’s essential Qi and condensed it.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his essential Qi was constantly becoming purer and more condensed. It was slowly advancing and approaching the ninth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm.</p><p>Six hours later, Lu Ming finally opened his eyes.</p><p>awesome, this is awesome. The heaven and earth spiritual Qi here is dozens of times, even hundreds of times stronger than outside. One day of cultivation here is equivalent to a hundred days of cultivation outside.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>After the cultivation earlier, although Lu Ming had not broken through to the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm, he was infinitely close to it.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that if he continued to cultivate here for half a month, he would be able to break through to the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>This speed was already very fast. One had to know that Lu Ming had already cultivated the true war Dragon technique to the seventh stage. The density and density of his essential Qi was eight times that of ordinary essential Qi.</p><p>The amount of energy required was simply too much.</p><p>If Lu Ming only relied on absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to cultivate, he would need at least a few years to break through to the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm in the outside world.</p><p>The spiritual energy here could greatly speed up Lu Ming’s cultivation speed.</p><p>“This is a really good place!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued cultivating.</p><p>This cultivation lasted for two days.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly felt the divine Guard token vibrate slightly.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped cultivating and took a look at the divine Guard token.</p><p>“There’s someone outside.”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>“Who is it? Could it be Jian Fengyun?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not know many people in the Emperor sky divine Palace. Who was looking for him now?</p><p>He stood up and walked out. The token glowed, and the light screen automatically separated.</p><p>Outside the courtyard, a handsome young man in a white robe stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p>The young man was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. He stood with his hands behind his back and did not exude any aura. However, Lu Ming felt as if he was looking up at a tall mountain.</p><p>This young man was like an insurmountable mountain just by standing there.</p><p>what a profound cultivation! This man is definitely a peerless master of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he had an idea.</p><p>The young man in white smiled warmly when he saw Lu Ming.”Lu Ming?”</p><p>“Yes, I am. May I know who you are?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’m mu Xiu Yuan, and I’m just an ordinary Emperor heaven Divine Guard of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.”</p><p>The white-robed youth laughed.</p><p>“Mu?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and asked tentatively, ” “Oh? I’ve never seen brother mu before. May I know why Brother mu has come to find me?”</p><p>it’s nothing serious. It’s just that you’ve just arrived, so there’s something I have to remind you of.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you didn’t go out for the past few days. Right now, the new batch of Ditian divine guards is spreading rumors that the eastern sky divine guards don’t live up to their name. They have the lowest combat strength and cultivation and shouldn’t occupy such good resources.”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>it’s absolutely true. Furthermore, this time, the east side is indeed the weakest. The South, North, and West side all have half-step King Warriors. The other three divine guards are all half-step King Warriors. Furthermore, the south and west side each have two half-step King Warriors. The competition is extremely intense.</p><p>only the east side. There is not a single half step King warrior. I heard that the two half step King Warriors from the south and west side have already set their eyes on you. I’m afraid they will challenge you. Once you lose, they will be able to take the throne of the eastern sky Divine Guard and occupy your residence. More importantly, they will take away your spot to enter the hundred deities slope.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He then looked at mu xiuyuan and said, ” “What I’m more curious about is why you’re telling me this for no reason?”</p><p>“You don’t need to know that. You’d better be careful during this period!”</p><p>Having said that, mu xiuyuan turned around, took a step, and disappeared.</p><p>“What a fast speed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Even with his eyesight, he almost couldn’t see how mu xiuyuan had left.</p><p>“This mu xiuyuan is probably more than a Lv 1 martial King. He might be even stronger. Who is he? Why did you remind me out of the kindness of your heart? you’re also surnamed mu. I wonder what your relationship with Senior Sister Mu Lan is?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts and doubts.</p><p>After thinking for a long time, he could not think of a reason.</p><p>forget it, I’ll go in and sort things out. It’s time to convert the resources into strength.</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, turned around and walked into the courtyard.</p><p>A moment later, in an ancient Hall of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, mu Xiu Yuan reported the news to an old man.</p><p>“I have already reminded Lu Ming.”</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said.</p><p>“MMM, that’s good. Although Lu Ming is not bad, he’s still far from that person. We can’t help him too much. Just a reminder will do. If he wants to become a powerful person, he has to rely on himself in the end. Only by going through trials and tribulations can he continue to become stronger. In the future, there’s a slight possibility that he can compete with that person.”</p><p>The old man said with a sigh.</p><p>it’s hard. However, that girl has good taste. She actually found such a genius in the small cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>Mu xiuyuan said with a smile.</p><p>After the two of them chatted for a while, mu xiuyuan took his leave.</p><p>“Little girl, you can’t go against your father’s decision!”</p><p>The old man sighed softly and then fell silent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
