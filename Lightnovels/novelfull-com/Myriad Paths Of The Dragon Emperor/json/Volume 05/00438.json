It represented destruction, but it also represented life.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was empty as he focused on comprehending the force of fire.</p><p>With the fire Force that he had comprehended and the fire concept from the outside world, Lu Ming’s comprehension of Fire Force had advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Time flew by quickly as Lu Ming cultivated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>…</p><p>In the cloud Emperor mountain range, the mystical sword sect of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>In the meeting hall of the mystical sword sect, Lin Xueyi, the sect leader of the mystical sword sect, Ling potian, the valley master of the Crimson Cloud Valley, Shangguan Ming of the ghostmoon saber sect, the other higher-ups of the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley, Hua Chi and the other higher-ups of the royal family, and Yan Quan were all gathered.</p><p>“How’s the war going?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi asked a golden-robed elder of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>sect leader, just like before, the main focus of the ten direction sword sect is defense. There will only be occasional small-scale attacks!</p><p>The gold-robed elder reported.</p><p>it seems like our guess was right. That sinister Qiu Wuyang must be waiting for the results of the selection. If Qiu changkong joins the Empyrean sky divine guards, he can use the Empyrean sky divine Palace’s power to deal with us.</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s face was serious.</p><p>that’s right. The Ditian divine guards are extremely powerful. If they mobilize the forces of some mid-tier empires to deal with us, we’ll be in deep trouble. Moreover, Qiu changkong has a powerful backer behind him!</p><p>Shangguan Ming said in a deep voice.</p><p>Everyone sighed, their expressions grave.</p><p>This question had been on everyone’s mind for more than half a year.</p><p>“Now, we can only hope that Lu Ming will succeed. If Lu Ming becomes the Ditian Divine Guard, then even if Qiu changkong joins the Ditian Divine Guard, he will still have some reservations.”</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>“The selection of the Ditian divine guards should have ended ten days ago. Is there still no news from them?”</p><p>Ling potian said anxiously.</p><p>I have already sent a group of people to wait for news in the cloud desolate Empire’s imperial capital. Once there is news, it will be sent back as quickly as possible!</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>“I’m really worried to death!”</p><p>Ling potian grinned.</p><p>He had always been impatient, and this matter concerned the fate of the sect, so he was even more anxious.</p><p>calm down. If it’s a blessing, it’s not a disaster. If it’s a disaster, you can’t avoid it!</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>Although he said this, he was still very anxious in his heart.</p><p>“Sect leader, sect leader, we have news!”</p><p>At this moment, a burly middle-aged man flew in from outside and shouted.</p><p>This middle-aged man was wearing a golden robe, and he was obviously a golden-robed elder.</p><p>“Elder Feng, is there any news about the Ditian Divine Guard selection?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi stood up and asked nervously.</p><p>“Not bad, there’s news!”</p><p>Elder Feng nodded heavily.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, how is Qiu changkong? Did he become a Ditian Divine Guard?”</p><p>Ling potian asked anxiously.</p><p>“Qiu changkong? He has indeed become a Ditian Divine Guard!”</p><p>Elder Feng thought for a moment before he spoke.</p><p>“What? Did Qiu changkong really become an empyrean heaven Divine Guard?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the others ‘faces all changed.</p><p>The worst thing had still happened. Qiu changkong had actually successfully become a Ditian Divine Guard. Everyone’s hearts were extremely heavy.</p><p>according to the news, Qiu changkong had a fortuitous encounter this time and became extremely powerful. Not only did he become an Emperor sky Divine Guard, but he also passed the last stage and participated in the battle for the East sky Divine Guard. Many of the strongest geniuses of the Emperor sky in super regions were defeated by him, and he finally made it into the top three in the battle for the East sky Divine Guard.</p><p>Elder Feng said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone’s faces changed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Everyone couldn’t control their breathing and stood up from their chairs. Their faces were pale and they looked terrible.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi kept repeating the same words. She couldn’t accept the news.</p><p>Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the others also had ugly expressions.</p><p>“How can Qiu changkong be so strong? How is this possible?”</p><p>Many people growled in disbelief. They really wished they were dreaming.</p><p>Not only had Qiu changkong joined the Ditian divine guards, but he had also participated in the battle for the East heaven divine guards and had even made it into the top three.</p><p>This was unbelievable. At the same time, it was a heavy blow to everyone.</p><p>Since Qiu changkong was so terrifying, he would definitely be placed in an even more important position in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. His status and power would definitely be greater as well.</p><p>it must be his master. It must be. Without his master’s help, how could Qiu changkong have reached this level? ”</p><p>An old Imperial uncle of the imperial family growled in a low voice. He was filled with unwillingness.</p><p>Now that Qiu changkong had reached such a level, the imperial family would never be able to take revenge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lin Xueyi seemed to have been drained of all her strength. She sat down heavily on the chair, a trace of despair in her eyes.</p><p>If even the strongest geniuses in a super-large region were no match for Qiu changkong, how could they fight back?</p><p>What could he use to resist?</p><p>“Well, sect leader, and everyone else, I’m not done with my information.”</p><p>Elder Feng hurriedly said when he saw the expressions on everyone’s faces.</p><p>“You haven’t finished? Could it be that Qiu changkong is going to do something even more shocking?”</p><p>Ling potian asked.</p><p>“That’s not it. It’s about Lu Ming!”</p><p>Elder Feng said.</p><p>“Oh? Has Lu Ming joined the Ditian divine guards?”</p><p>Hua chiqiang asked, raising his spirits.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is indeed a genius. He successfully joined the Ditian Divine Guard. I heard that only three people from the 36 empires of Emperor Yun joined the Ditian Divine Guard!</p><p>Elder Feng said rather smugly.</p><p>“Lu Ming has joined the Ditian divine guards. Haha, I knew it. He would definitely succeed!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes lit up as he smiled.</p><p>He was happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the others were not happy at all. If they had heard about Qiu changkong before, they would have been extremely excited.</p><p>But now, they couldn’t be happy.</p><p>The ordinary Ditian divine guards were far inferior to the geniuses who could compete for the East sky divine guards.</p><p>There was no comparison at all.</p><p>Moreover, Qiu changkong had entered the top three. Not only was his personal combat strength much stronger than the ordinary Empyrean heavens divine guards, but his status and authority were also much higher. He did not have to worry about Lu Ming at all.</p><p>They were still in a worrying situation.</p><p>Lu Ming is indeed a peerless genius. To think that he could become an Empyrean Heavenly Divine Guard. He can be said to be a genius that only appears once in a thousand years in the blazing sun Empire. What a pity. What a pity that he met Qiu changkong!</p><p>Lin Xueyi sighed.</p><p>“Um, sect leader, everyone, I’m not done with my information. Lu Ming did not just join the Ditian divine guards!”</p><p>Elder Feng continued.</p><p>“Ah? Could it be that Lu Ming also passed the last stage and participated in the fight for the eastern sky divine guards?”</p><p>The eyes of Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the others lit up.</p><p>Although reason told them that it was almost impossible because it was too difficult, they still hoped that it was real and that a miracle would happen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
