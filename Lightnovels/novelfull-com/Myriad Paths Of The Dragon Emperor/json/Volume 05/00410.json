Continue, heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm, and the heaven’s path palm print blasted forward.</p><p>At the same time, dandan followed the palm print of the heavenly Dao and rushed forward.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others ‘faces turned green.</p><p>He had to block the heaven path palm print on one hand and defend against dandan on the other. How was he going to fight?</p><p>“You guys block the palm print!”</p><p>Huang chixuan shouted.</p><p>He really didn’t dare to be distracted, or else he would be hit by dandan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other Masters of Phoenix Lake worked together to resist the palm print, while Huang chixuan stared at dandan.</p><p>The palm force rumbled. Without Huang chixuan, the experts of Phoenix Lake could not withstand Lu Ming’s palm force at all. Each and every one of them trembled and coughed up blood.</p><p>At the same time, dandan also rushed in and smashed towards Huang chixuan.</p><p>This time, Huang chixuan was even more miserable. Although he tried his best to resist, he was still heavily smashed. This time, all his teeth were smashed out, his mouth was in a mess and his nose collapsed.</p><p>His originally handsome face instantly turned into a pile of dog shit.</p><p>“Live Gu, live Gu!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared, but because his mouth was full of holes, he originally wanted to say ‘I’, but in the end, he said’ live’.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew back and jumped up and down on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that this guy was very excited.</p><p>“Get (go) [ quickly get (go) ]!”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s mouth was leaking air as he roared. Now, he no longer cared about the Dragon Bone. If he stayed any longer, he was afraid that he would be crushed to death by the stone egg.</p><p>With an angry roar, he turned around and ran away with the people of Phoenix Lake.</p><p>However, the grievance in his heart was needless to mention.</p><p>“Hahaha! Take care, I won’t send you off!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Huang chixuan and the others almost spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>In the distance, when the others saw this scene, they could only feel their eyelids twitching non-stop. They secretly warned themselves not to provoke the ruthless Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the stone wall and sized up the Dragon bones.</p><p>The Dragon Bone was as white as Jade and crystal clear. One side of it was embedded in the stone wall, and the other side was exposed.</p><p>What was exposed outside was about the thickness of a water tank and a meter long.</p><p>He could clearly feel the surging essence Qi in the bone banner.</p><p>this might really be a Dragon Bone. Otherwise, it would still contain such dense spiritual essence even after so many years!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sparkling.</p><p>With this Dragon Bone, his true war Dragon technique might be able to advance by a few steps.</p><p>Lu Ming then grabbed the Dragon Bone with both hands and pulled it out with all his might.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone wall made a cracking sound, but it was not pulled out.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled. The muscles in his body bulged, and his physical strength exploded to the maximum. At the same time, the true war Dragon technique was fully activated.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the wall, hugged the Dragon Bone with both hands, and pulled it out with all his might.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The stone wall under Lu Ming’s feet exploded. However, the Dragon Bone loosened and was slowly pulled out.</p><p>With a final bang, the entire Dragon Bone was pulled out.</p><p>It was a bone that was three meters long and as thick as a water tank. However, the deeper it went, the thinner it became.</p><p>“It looks like a finger bone!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up curiously.</p><p>It looked like a finger bone of a true dragon.</p><p>“Great harvest, what a great harvest!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and kept the finger bone in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Not far away, the others were watching enviously, but no one dared to step forward to fight for it. What a joke, didn’t they see that even the geniuses of Phoenix Lake had been beaten up so badly?</p><p>After keeping the Dragon bones, Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>They didn’t come across any precious treasures along the way.</p><p>After about ten miles, there was light in front.</p><p>that’s a huge underground cave. That’s the true Dragon’s dwelling place!</p><p>“Charge, charge!”</p><p>Immediately, everyone’s hearts burned with excitement as they rushed towards the light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the cave and appeared in an extremely wide underground cave.</p><p>The underground cave was too wide. It was more than ten miles in both length and width and several thousand meters in height. The walls of the cave were inlaid with luminous stones that illuminated the cave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air rang out continuously.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that there were two huge holes in the surrounding walls. Figures were flying in one after another.</p><p>It was bu Feifan from the flaming Mountain range, and sun Chu from the Yang Spring Valley.</p><p>They had split into three paths before, and they had entered the other two paths. It turned out that this was the final destination.</p><p>“This is the true Dragon’s final resting place. There must be Supreme treasures here!”</p><p>“Yi, there’s a jade bed over there. It’s so big!”</p><p>After the commotion, most of the people flew towards the center of the underground cave.</p><p>Because there was a huge jade bed there, about a hundred meters in length and width, it was extremely shocking.</p><p>“You ants, get lost!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A burning aura burst out from bu Feifan’s body. He slashed out a huge flaming Saber Light, and a dozen young men were killed.</p><p>“Quick, avoid the people from the Super area!”</p><p>Those in the larger regions were shocked and dodged.</p><p>“Haha, kill!”</p><p>Bu Feifan laughed. He took the lead and slashed with his flaming saber. No one could withstand his attack.</p><p>On the other side, Sun Chu was also rushing forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword radiance streaked across the sky. Xuan Feng stepped on the sword radiance and the people around him avoided him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s mouth was filled with air as he shouted and rushed forward with the people of Phoenix Lake.</p><p>Almost everyone’s target was the Jade bed.</p><p>“Argh! What was that? A scale, that’s a dragon scale?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the middle of the Jade bed, there was a scale. This scale was very special. It was actually flashing with three different lights. It was the size of a water tank and was filled with a powerful Dragon aura.</p><p>It was definitely a dragon scale.</p><p>A true Dragon’s scale was definitely a Supreme treasure.</p><p>“Kill, it’s mine!”</p><p>Sun Chu roared.</p><p>“Sun Chu, you wish! The Dragon scale is mine!”</p><p>Bu Feifan shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Immediately, a great battle broke out. As long as someone rushed forward, they would all be caught in a great battle.</p><p>Screams rang out continuously. In almost an instant, hundreds of people were killed. The smell of blood filled the air, and corpses covered the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Sun Chu, bu Feifan, Xuan Feng, Huang chixuan, the four experts, were in a chaotic battle. No one wanted the other to get the Dragon scale.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. His gaze was not on the Jade bed but the depths of the cave.</p><p>There were stone walls on all three sides of the cave, and there were luminous stones on the stone walls.</p><p>Only that direction was pitch black. It wasn’t a stone wall, but seemed to be empty, with wisps of black mist permeating.</p><p>When Lu Ming entered this place, he felt that the nine Dragon bloodlines were unusually agitated, as if they were very eager to go in that direction.</p><p>Yes, very much so!</p><p>What was in that direction?</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>“Let’s not worry about it for now. We’ll talk after we get the Dragon’s scale.”</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming’s figure moved and he pounced toward the Dragon scale.</p><p>“Brat, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>Just as he was about to approach the Dragon’s scale, two terrifying attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a Phoenix Wing and a flaming blade.</p><p>It was Huang chixuan and bu Feifan who had attacked him.</p><p>Both of their attacks were extremely terrifying. Lu Ming could not ignore them. He could only block them with all his might, but his figure was blocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
