Its nine leaves, which looked like divine swords, burst with dazzling sword intent, stirring the wind and clouds.</p><p>The wind, fire, and gold Palace Masters ‘eyes lit up as they stared at the sword-shaped plant.</p><p>“I’m willing to sell this sword-shaped plant to you, seniors.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, haha! Lu Ming, I’ll offer 120000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals!</p><p>The wind Palace Master immediately said. It was twenty thousand more than the one hundred thousand he had offered previously.</p><p>I’ll give you 150000 top quality spirit crystals. This sword-shaped plant is mine, so don’t fight with me.</p><p>The palace master of gold Palace said.</p><p>“Don’t fight with you? Old man Jin, you wish! Let me tell you, this sword-shaped plant is mine too.”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said coldly, not giving in at all.</p><p>damn it, damn it! Lu Ming, that little b * stard, he wants to sell this sword-shaped plant. Damn it, this sword-shaped plant is mine!</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart, and his eyes were burning with fire.</p><p>He was initially planning on how to get his hands on Lu Ming’s sword-shaped plant. However, if Lu Ming were to sell it to other Hall Masters, his hopes would be dashed.</p><p>He was also very interested in the sword-shaped plant. He wanted to bid for it but he could not bring himself to do so. Even if he did, Lu Ming would definitely not sell it to him.</p><p>His killing intent toward Lu Ming grew stronger.</p><p>The palace Masters were in a heated argument.</p><p>Among the five Palace Masters, except for the earth Palace Master, the others were all sword practitioners, and they all wanted the sword-shaped plant.</p><p>“Seniors, please listen to this junior!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke again. His clear voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>The few Hall Masters quietened down and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hall Masters, this junior has a suggestion, is it possible?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, tell me.”</p><p>The wind Palace Master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and said, ” Hall Masters, I don’t want to sell this sword-shaped plant for so many Supreme spiritual crystals. Just like the wager just now, I’ll only sell it for 80000 Supreme spiritual crystals. However, I’m not selling it to one person. I’ll sell it to all of you at the same time. In this way, all of you can study it together in the future. Isn’t that better? ”</p><p>“How many people will comprehend it together?”</p><p>The palace Masters were stunned for a moment. After some thought, they nodded.</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire said.</p><p>“I don’t have any intent either. Old Jin, what about you?”</p><p>The wind Palace Master looked at the gold Palace Master.</p><p>“Since you all have no objections, I naturally have no objections as well.”</p><p>The gold Palace Master also said.</p><p>alright, then I’ll sell it to the wind, fire, and metal temple Masters at the same time. The three temple Masters only need to pay a total of 80000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He had directly ignored Thunder Palace Master, which made him grit his teeth even more.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 80000 Supreme spiritual crystals is too little. This sword-shaped plant can easily be sold for more than 100000 Supreme spiritual crystals in the market. How about this? the three of us will each offer 40000 Supreme spiritual crystals. That’s a total of 120000 Supreme spiritual crystals to buy this sword-shaped plant.”</p><p>Palace Master Feng said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The two Hall Masters, Fire and Gold, nodded.</p><p>Then, the three of them each took out 40000 pieces of top-grade spiritual crystals, totaling 120000 pieces, and handed them to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Many thanks to all the seniors.”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He handed the sword-shaped plant to the three Hall Masters.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, even if you didn’t acknowledge me as your master, if you have any questions regarding the creation of wind in the future, you can come to me. I’ll definitely tell you everything I know.</p><p>The wind Palace Master was obviously in a good mood after getting the sword-shaped plant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if there’s anything you don’t understand about the fire concept, you can come to me!”</p><p>The palace Master of fire laughed.</p><p>The others were so envious that they were about to go crazy. Lu Ming’s treatment was too good, right?</p><p>ahem, Lu Ming, if you’re suddenly interested in the creation of metal in the future, you can come to me. I’ll definitely teach you with all my heart.</p><p>The gold Palace Master let out a few dry coughs and said.</p><p>“Hey, old monster Jin, don’t mislead the disciples …”</p><p>The wind Palace Master glared at the gold Palace Master and shouted. However, at the next moment, he thought of Lu Ming’s abnormal talent and immediately shut his mouth.</p><p>Who could guarantee that Lu Ming would not be interested in the creation of gold in the future?</p><p>thank you, Palace master of gold. If Lu Ming wants to comprehend the creation of gold, I’ll have to trouble you, Palace Master Jin.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still answered with a serious look.</p><p>This made many people speechless. Could it be that Lu Ming really had his eyes on the creation of gold?</p><p>Please, you’ve already comprehended three types of intent realms, alright?</p><p>Many people were already too tired to complain.</p><p>“Haha, then let’s go!”</p><p>The wind, fire, and gold Hall Masters chuckled.</p><p>They couldn’t wait to go back and study the sword-shaped plants.</p><p>With a move, the three Hall Masters disappeared.</p><p>“Take your senior brother and come back with me!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master looked at Qiu changkong and snorted coldly. He stepped into the air and disappeared.</p><p>Qiu changkong hurriedly brought Xue Chao along and left.</p><p>Then, the palace Master of earth and the other guardians left one by one.</p><p>A soul-stirring challenge rarely seen since ancient times had come to an end.</p><p>“Lu … Brother Lu, it’s been a while since we last met, but your achievements have been unforgettable.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun sighed as he flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Jian, you’re too kind. Lu Ming was just lucky. If you’re free, why don’t you come to the eastern sky courtyard?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming acknowledged that Jian Fengyun was a man who valued relationships and loyalty. He had also spoken up for justice just now.</p><p>“Good! I have some questions about martial arts that I’d like to ask brother Lu.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s eyes flickered as he said.</p><p>Then, the two of them rose into the air and flew toward the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming left, the others also quickly dispersed.</p><p>The news of this battle spread like a whirlwind.</p><p>When Lu Ming and Jian Fengyun returned to the eastern sky courtyard, they sat down on the stone bench in the courtyard. Lu Ming took out a pot of wine and the two of them chatted as they drank.</p><p>During this period, Jian Fengyun consulted Lu Ming in detail about the problems from force to the comprehension of intent.</p><p>Lu Ming had comprehended three kinds of concepts at the same time. He had a very deep understanding of the problem of advancing from force to concept. He told her everything he knew and his experience.</p><p>After hearing this, Jian Fengyun’s eyes lit up and his face lit up. He had obviously gained a lot.</p><p>Two hours later, Jian Fengyun finally bade farewell and left.</p><p>“Continue to refine your true Yuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with excitement.</p><p>This time, he had obtained a total of 230000 Supreme spiritual crystals. In addition to the 10000 Supreme spiritual crystals he had obtained earlier, he had a total of 240000 Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>He was simply getting rich.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming took out 5000 pieces of top-grade spirit crystals and exploded them all. He then began to refine his vital essence.</p><p>As the days passed, Lu Ming’s essential core percentage increased.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
