He looked very noble.</p><p>...</p><p>Zi Dong, the 19th place in the thousand River region!</p><p>As soon as this young man appeared, someone immediately whispered.</p><p>He was ranked 19th in the thousand River region. He was already an expert on the same level as Jian Fengyun.</p><p>Zi Dong was very arrogant. He looked at Lu Ming coldly and exuded a powerful aura.”Lu Ming, although your combat strength is not bad, you’re too arrogant. However, I can give you a chance. If you can survive three of my sword strikes, I can consider sparing your life!”</p><p>“I’m still alive after taking three of your sword strikes? If you want to make a move, then do it quickly. I can give you a chance to use your sword. You’d better use all your trump cards. After that, you won’t have another chance.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Who didn’t know how to be crazy?</p><p>“Arrogant, then die!”</p><p>Zi Dong’s killing intent burst out and his body emitted a strong purple light.</p><p>“Extreme Purple sword technique, one sword from the East!”</p><p>Zi Dong let out a long roar and unsheathed his sword. In an instant, the sky was filled with purple Qi.</p><p>Then, a purple sword radiance shot out from the purple clouds and headed toward Lu Ming like a fairy from heaven.</p><p>The speed was so fast that a long trace appeared in the sky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>However, what welcomed him was Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. It was just an ordinary kick, but it contained a powerful essential Qi and the power of wind and Fire.</p><p>With this kick, the purple sword light fell apart. This kick directly landed on Zi Dong’s face.</p><p>In an instant, Zi Dong’s face was deformed. He didn’t even have time to scream before he was sent flying backward. He crashed into seven or eight trees and left a deep trail on the ground. He lay on the ground a thousand meters away, his body convulsing. He was already exhaling more than he was inhaling.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>Everyone gasped and looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>Wasn’t this too overbearing? he had kicked Zi Dong half dead with one kick. What kind of combat power was this?</p><p>Young master Tian she, Yan feixun, and the others swallowed their saliva. They could feel cold sweat on their backs and their hands and feet were trembling.</p><p>They could not help but wonder what the consequences would be if Lu Ming had kicked their faces.</p><p>Jian Fengyun was stunned as well. Then, his eyes lit up with hope.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>The blue-robed young man from the thousand River region and the five or six young men beside him all looked serious.</p><p>“I said, you only have one chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Zi Dong indifferently and did not look at him again.</p><p>Hmph, you’re only in the early stage of martial ancestor 8-dan. Among us, there are at least six people who are not weaker than you. Those who can kill you are not few either!</p><p>In the waters of the thousand rivers, a young man snorted coldly, and a cold killing intent burst out from his body.</p><p>“Oh? Who didn’t know how to shoot their mouths off? That’s what that guy said just now, but in the end, he couldn’t even take a kick from me. I think you people from the thousand River region can only talk for fun, but once you start fighting, you’re all trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a provocative look at the crowd at the thousand River area.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The people of the thousand River region were instantly enraged.</p><p>With the blue-robed young man as the center, powerful auras burst out one by one.</p><p>One after another, auras shot up into the sky like smoke signals. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>cut the crap. You guys can come at me together. I’m too lazy to fight you one by one.</p><p>A contemptuous smile hung on the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth as he said indifferently.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The genius from the thousand River region was so angry that his mouth almost twisted.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge all the geniuses in the thousand River region alone? This was a blatant insult and a blatant contempt.</p><p>However, young master Tian she, Yan feixun, and the rest were overjoyed.”Haha, Lu Ming is such an idiot. He’s so arrogant now that he has some combat strength. He actually dares to challenge all the geniuses in the thousand River area? He’s really looking for death!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s expression changed as well. He shouted, ” “Lu Ming, you can’t. The top ten geniuses of the thousand River region are all here. That blue-robed young man is Jiang wantian, the number one genius of the thousand River region. You can’t be careless. You’d better break out of the encirclement quickly.”</p><p>Judging from Lu Ming’s attack, he was definitely stronger than him. Lu Ming had reached the eighth grade martial ancestor realm and was definitely a three-man genius. If Lu Ming had tried his best to break out of the encirclement, he might have been able to kill his way out. However, if he challenged all the geniuses of the thousand River region, especially Jiang wantian, he would basically die.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the others and continued to say in disdain, ” hurry up. I’ve said it before. You can’t leave today. If you don’t want to do it, then let me do it!</p><p>“Arrogant and ignorant, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>A cold-looking young man roared and stepped forward. A long spear appeared in his hand, emitting a shocking aura.</p><p>This was a genius in the early stage of the martial ancestor realm level 8, and he was definitely a genius who had won three battles.</p><p>“Die!</p><p>The cold-looking young man was very direct. He thrust his spear forward and a shocking spear radiance burst out.</p><p>“Your spear technique is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand. With a shake of his arm, the demon subduing spear shot out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance rumbled as the two spears ‘tips stabbed into each other.</p><p>A loud explosion caused ripples on the tips of the two spears.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. His surging essential Qi gushed out madly. At the same time, the power of wind and Fire suddenly erupted.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The cold-looking young man’s spear, which was of upper Lv 4, made a cracking sound and cracked.</p><p>Immediately, the cold-looking young man screamed and his body flew out like a cannonball. He flew hundreds of meters before he stopped. There were several gunshot wounds on his body and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>I’ve said it before. All you can do is talk. Once you start fighting, you’re all useless.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled contemptuously. Then, he shook the long spear and kept it.</p><p>The demon subduing spear should be a fourth-level spiritual weapon, but the material used was definitely a fifth-level spiritual weapon. It was extremely hard and could withstand Lu Ming’s full-strength outburst.</p><p>“Sir, you do have some skill. Then I can’t let you go today. Let’s attack together and kill this person!”</p><p>Jiang wantian’s face was extremely solemn as he spoke slowly.</p><p>The strength that Lu Ming had displayed was too shocking. Even he was not confident that he could win. The only way was to gather the strength of everyone in the thousand River region to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>I told you all to attack together. Why did you wait until now? alright, the warm-up is over. I’ll send you all on your way now!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jiang wantian was the first to shout, and a shocking aura rose from his body.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that Jiang wantian was not any weaker than you Feiyu.</p><p>But, so what?</p><p>Other than Jiang wantian, there were five other people who had also reached the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>In addition, there were more than a dozen seventh level martial ancestor realm experts.</p><p>With so many experts attacking together, the power was simply earth-shaking.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Young master Tian she and the others roared in their hearts. At the same time, they retreated quickly, afraid that they would be affected.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun shouted.</p><p>He wanted to help, but with so many experts attacking him at the same time and him already injured, he simply had no strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
