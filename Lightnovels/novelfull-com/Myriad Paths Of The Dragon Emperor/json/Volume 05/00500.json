The light curtain outside was also shaking crazily as if it would burst at any time.</p><p>Moreover, although the light screen had blocked the flaming palm, there was still a terrifying force that seeped into the light screen.</p><p>In the courtyard, Lu Ming felt a strong impact.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The terrifying force landed on Lu Ming’s body, causing him to cough up blood.</p><p>The sacred glory was too powerful. Although only a trace of power had seeped into it, it had already injured Lu Ming.</p><p>“This old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He wanted to enter the Supreme shrine, but he realized that he could not.</p><p>f * ck, there’s no need to do this. I can’t fight against this old man at all, and you won’t let me in? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>“Little bastard, I can still cripple you even if you hide inside!”</p><p>Outside, Sheng Yao shouted coldly and slapped again.</p><p>This time, it formed a giant palm that was several times larger than the previous one. It grabbed the entire eastern sky courtyard and pulled it out.</p><p>He wanted to uproot the entire Eastern heaven courtyard.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The eastern sky courtyard shook violently as waves of energy seeped into it. Lu Ming’s body was under a terrible pressure, making cracking sounds. His bones were about to break.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Quickly stop!”</p><p>At this time, a few figures flew over at an unbelievable speed. Before they finished speaking, they had already appeared not far away.</p><p>“Hall Master, three Hall Masters!”</p><p>Wind Palace Master, Fire Palace Master, and gold Palace Master!</p><p>Many of the Empyrean heavens divine guards shouted.</p><p>shengyao, stop. You’ve already violated the rules of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace by attacking the other empyrean heaven divine guards without restraint!</p><p>“Hurry up and stop!”</p><p>The palace Masters shouted.</p><p>“How can you interrupt when my Sheng family is doing business? get lost!”</p><p>The sacred glory was extremely powerful. Even in the face of the temple Masters, it still shouted loudly.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The three Hall Masters looked at the eastern heaven courtyard that was covered by the giant flaming hand with worry.</p><p>shengyao, you’ve already broken the rules. As the palace Masters of the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region, we have the responsibility to stop you. Attack!</p><p>The wind Palace Master shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The wind, fire, and metal temple Masters attacked at the same time. Three vast attacks bombarded the sacred glory.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Sacred light’s eyes turned cold. A fiery red saber appeared in his other hand, and he slashed.</p><p>A thousand-meter-long flaming saber radiance slashed out, as if it could split the sky.</p><p>The attacks of the three Hall Masters crumbled under the blazing saber radiance.</p><p>The three Hall Masters ‘expressions changed drastically as they quickly retreated.</p><p>peak-tier King, glory, you’ve broken through to peak-tier King? ”</p><p>The wind Palace Master and the other two exclaimed.</p><p>“That’s right. Do you still want to stop me?”</p><p>Holy light said coldly.</p><p>The wind Palace Master and the other two had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>A peak-tier King was already half a step into the first realm of the three spiritual God realms, the spirit sea realm.</p><p>Although the three of them were all late-stage King tiers, even if they worked together, they still wouldn’t be a match for a peak-tier King.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Although the inscription formation around the eastern sky courtyard was profound, under the attack of the sacred glory, it was almost unable to withstand it and was pulled out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Although the wind Palace Master and the others were extremely anxious, they were helpless in the face of the divine glory that had already broken through to the peak-tier King level.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you dare to disrespect me? only death awaits you!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master sneered in his heart.</p><p>As for Sheng Wushuang, he was also overjoyed.</p><p>“Die, die! Lu Ming, no matter how arrogant you are, what’s the use of facing the Sheng family? In the Tianxuan region, apart from the MU family, the Sheng family is the sky and everything.”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang laughed wildly in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, a gust of wind blew, and the flaming hand that covered the eastern sky courtyard dissipated at a speed visible to the naked eye, turning into nothingness.</p><p>The eastern heaven courtyard regained its peace.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming spat out a few mouthfuls of blood. His clothes were stained with blood, his face was pale, and his breathing was shallow.</p><p>He was already seriously injured just now.</p><p>“Old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming lay on the ground and cursed.</p><p>Outside the eastern sky courtyard, the Holy Light’s expression changed.</p><p>“Mu Zheng!”</p><p>A solemn voice came out of holy light’s mouth.</p><p>Without a sound, an old man in a green robe appeared with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the palace Master!”</p><p>The wind Palace Master, Fire Palace Master, and the others, including the Thunder Palace Master, changed their expressions and hurriedly saluted the old man.</p><p>“What? The palace Master?”</p><p>“Ah? Could he be the palace Lord of the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>This time, many of the Ditian divine guards revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>The palace Lord of the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region was a mysterious figure, and very few people had ever seen him. No one had expected him to show up today.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the palace Master!”</p><p>The Ditian divine guards present all saluted the green-robed elder.</p><p>“Damn it, isn’t mu Zheng in closed door cultivation? Why did he come out of seclusion? damn it!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart.</p><p>“Mm! No need to be so polite!”</p><p>Mu Zheng waved his sleeve and a gentle breeze blew. Everyone felt a gentle force lifting them up.</p><p>“Palace Master? Could it be that the palace Master has arrived?”</p><p>In the eastern sky courtyard, Lu Ming naturally heard the voices outside and his expression changed.</p><p>Then, he struggled to get up and walked out of the eastern sky courtyard.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked out, everyone’s eyes turned to him in unison.</p><p>“This little bastard is still alive? It can actually move!”</p><p>The Thunder Palace Master thought.</p><p>The wind Palace Master and the others heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>However, sacred light’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Mu Zheng, you’ve come at the right time. This little bastard has offended his superiors, talked back to his elders, and even injured the elites of my Sheng clan. He deserves to die a thousand deaths. Now, I’ll take him back to the central region and deal with him!”</p><p>Sheng Yao said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, shengyao, don’t play this trick in front of me. Do you think I don’t know what kind of people you are? Lu Ming beat up your Sheng family member, and you’re the one who asked for it. You’re useless, so who can you blame?”</p><p>“Is there a need to talk back to an elder? As an elder, if he didn’t do what an elder should do, shouldn’t he talk back? We can fight!”</p><p>Mu Zheng smiled faintly and casually glanced at the Thunder Palace Master.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s face immediately turned pale, and his heart turned cold.</p><p>“Mu Zheng, what’s wrong with you? it seems like you’re determined to interfere today?”</p><p>Sheng Yao’s face was extremely ugly as he shouted.</p><p>“This place is the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region and is under my jurisdiction. What do you think about causing trouble here?”</p><p>Mu Zheng said.</p><p>“Good, very good. Mu Zheng, I’ve heard that you’re about to open up your spirit ocean and break through to the spirit ocean realm. Today, I’d like to give it a try!”</p><p>Sacred light’s eyes showed a trace of fighting intent.</p><p>“A battle in the air!”</p><p>Mu Zheng’s answer was very simple.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Mu Zheng and the sacred glory flashed and rushed into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shaking boom came from the sky, and a powerful pressure spread out for hundreds of miles.</p><p>The wind and the flames covered the entire sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
