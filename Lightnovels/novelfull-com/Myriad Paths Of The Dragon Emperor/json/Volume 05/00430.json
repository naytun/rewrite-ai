Although they kept nullifying the power of Lu Ming’s kick, they could not stop it completely.</p><p>Lu Ming’s foot continued to move forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He crushed the ball of lightning in front of Qiu changkong with his foot and stomped on his face.</p><p>Qiu changkong let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying backward. He rolled over a dozen times on the ground before he managed to stand up.</p><p>However, his face was already swollen and blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The footprint was especially clear, and it was imprinted on Qiu changkong’s face.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>Lu Ming was too shameless. He had attacked without any warning.</p><p>However, they were more shocked by Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>In front of Qiu changkong and zang Sheng, a kick that sent Qiu changkong flying would be useless even if it was a sneak attack if one was not strong enough.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could actually do it. It was enough to show how terrifying his abilities were.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared madly. He was going crazy with hatred.</p><p>He was careless and was kicked in the face by Lu Ming. This was a great humiliation.</p><p>He could not wait to skin Lu Ming alive.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if I don’t kill you, I’m not a human!”</p><p>Qiu changkong bellowed in rage. He had gone completely mad.</p><p>His body was covered in dense lightning, and his combat power erupted without any reservation.</p><p>“Lightning sword, world annihilation!”</p><p>The combat sword was unsheathed, and a sword of lightning cut through the sky as if it had come from beyond the sky.</p><p>“Dragon devour, point!”</p><p>At the same time, zang Sheng also made his move, using his ultimate move.</p><p>Without a doubt, both of them had unleashed the power of their bloodlines. The two of them attacked at the same time with terrifying power that seemed to be able to destroy everything as they attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they looked at the fighting ring.</p><p>Could Lu Ming block it? Although Lu Ming’s kick had been very powerful, Qiu changkong had only been hit by it because he had been careless.</p><p>That was what most people thought.</p><p>Now, faced with Qiu changkong and zang Sheng’s all-out attacks, did Lu Ming still stand a chance?</p><p>He wouldn’t be killed in one shot, right? That would be breaking the rules.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming bent his legs and leaped. His figure soared into the sky, instantly reaching a thousand meters in the air.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t even think about escaping!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Burial and Qiu changkong roared and changed the direction of their attacks, continuing to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Escape? who’s escaping?”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly, the corners of his lips curling into a cold smile.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge stone tablet rushed out. Five silver chakras flashed and then rushed into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>five Meridian cycles, fifth level King level Blood Meridian. Lu Ming is only a mere fifth level King level Blood Meridian.</p><p>“Can you guys see it? His cultivation is only at the peak of the 8th level of the martial ancestor realm. With such combat strength, he actually challenged Qiu changkong and zang Sheng at the same time. What a joke, what a joke.”</p><p>so he has always been relying on luck. That kick just now was also calculated but not calculated.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming’s aura exploded, it caused a wave of contempt and ridicule.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Qiu changkong and zang Sheng’s attacks closed in on Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down from above and took a step.</p><p>&Nbsp; a dragon roar resounded, shaking the world as a vast energy pressed down.</p><p>“This move again, break!”</p><p>Qiu changkong roared. He had comprehended a trace of the force of Thunder, causing Qiu changkong’s attack power to rise to a terrifying level.</p><p>The power of the lightning sword burst forth and tore a hole in the power of Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps.</p><p>At the same time, zang Sheng pointed his finger and Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps collapsed instantly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The two of them roared.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he took another step forward.</p><p>The second step, the second step of the nine Dragons heaven treading steps, was another step on top of the first step.</p><p>The nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was getting stronger with each step he took. With every step he took, the power of the steps would increase exponentially.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current physical body and the strength of his essential Qi, the second step could barely be comparable to the first level of a heaven level martial arts technique.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled as if a true dragon was patrolling the world. The space trembled violently, and a crazy amount of power gushed out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Zang Sheng and Qiu changkong’s bodies trembled, and their expressions changed drastically. Their attacks collapsed in an instant. After that, they felt an incomparably powerful force surging towards them. The two of them felt as if they had been hit by an ancient divine mountain. Their bodies were like meteors, falling to the ground.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them stepped onto the fighting ring, causing it to rumble. Their faces turned pale and they almost spat out blood.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Everyone in the audience gasped.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened as they looked at the young man in the air in disbelief.</p><p>With one move, he had repelled the combined attacks of burial and Qiu changkong and even gained the upper hand.</p><p>Was this Lu Ming’s ability?</p><p>This was simply unbelievable. This was too terrifying, right?</p><p>oh my god, oh my god, am I seeing things? did Lu Ming defeat burial and Qiu changkong in one move? ”</p><p>this is unbelievable. Lu Ming’s cultivation is only at the peak of the eighth level martial ancestor realm, but he’s so terrifying. How many battles has he gone through? ”</p><p>“How could this be? How could there be such a powerful genius in the world?”</p><p>Countless people were so shocked that they were incoherent.</p><p>Burial was already at the peak of the ninth level of the martial arts Grandmaster realm, an entire level higher than Lu Ming.</p><p>Furthermore, burial himself was a genius who had surpassed the four battle geniuses. Adding them up, he was more than five levels higher than an ordinary martial ancestor 8-dan peak.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually suppress burial. Did that not mean that Lu Ming was a level six talent?</p><p>A talent of six battles!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled at the thought of this word.</p><p>A four-battle genius was already a rare genius in the world. Then, what kind of concept was a six-battle genius?</p><p>No one could imagine it.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming drew the bye card three times in a row, everyone thought that he was just lucky. If he really had to fight, he would have been defeated long ago.</p><p>Now, they realized that they were gravely mistaken.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to take action, he could simply sweep them away.</p><p>At the edge of the fighting ring, the geniuses who had already lost were pale.</p><p>In particular, there were a few people who boasted shamelessly earlier that if Lu Ming encountered them, they would finish him off in three moves.</p><p>Now, their faces were burning hot, and they wished they could find a hole in the ground to hide in.</p><p>It was really embarrassing.</p><p>In the area for the elders, Lu Xiu was stunned. Then, his body began to tremble uncontrollably as if he had epilepsy.</p><p>Excited, he was too excited.</p><p>Like the others, he had thought that Lu Ming was just lucky. However, he now realized that Lu Ming was a rare genius.</p><p>Even the middle-aged protector’s pupils contracted. Then, he revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>“This time, a rare genius has finally appeared.”</p><p>The middle-aged protector was overjoyed.</p><p>how can this be? impossible. How can Lu Ming be so powerful? ”</p><p>On the battle platform, Qiu changkong cried out hysterically, finding it hard to accept this.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s eyes were also filled with shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
