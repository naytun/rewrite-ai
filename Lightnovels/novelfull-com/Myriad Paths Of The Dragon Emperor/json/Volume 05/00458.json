Thunder concept?”</p><p>Oh my God, oh my earth! Lu Ming has actually cultivated the Thunder mentality and he has successfully comprehended it.</p><p>“Three intents? how is that possible? I’ve never seen him use the Thunder mentality before.”</p><p>this is too heaven-defying. Too heaven-defying. He’s cultivating three wills at the same time and he’s improving so fast. How are others supposed to live? ”</p><p>in the past, who said that Lu Ming was arrogant, conceited, and stubborn? he must have been blind. Lu Ming clearly knows his own limitations and his talent. That’s why he cultivated three concepts. If he only cultivated one concept, that would be a real stubborn and waste of talent!</p><p>“Xu, lower your voice. That was said by the wind Palace Master and the lightning Palace Master. The lightning Palace Master even asked Lu Ming to get out of the lightning Palace and not let him listen to the class.”</p><p>“Ah? Oh no, he couldn’t have been heard, right? But I’m telling the truth.”</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>In the sky, the palace Master of wind coughed dryly, embarrassed.</p><p>“Haha, it seems like I was wrong.”</p><p>The wind Palace Master laughed and did not get angry.</p><p>However, Thunder Palace Master was different.</p><p>His eyes were filled with hatred as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>That day, he berated Lu Ming and asked him to get out of the Thunder Summit, saying that he was not qualified to listen to his lessons and that he would not have any achievements in his life.</p><p>He even used his aura to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>But how long had it been? Not only had Lu Ming cultivated the Wind and Fire concept, but he had also cultivated the Thunder concept. This was equivalent to Lu Ming giving him a tight slap across his face.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! Little bastard, this old man said you’re a good-for-nothing, so you should be a good-for-nothing for the rest of your life! You actually dare to cultivate to this level? you’re clearly going against this old man and embarrassing me! You deserve death! You deserve death!”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master roared in his heart. His eyes were extremely sinister.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming’s concept of Thunder was unleashed, it shook the entire place and set off a monstrous uproar.</p><p>Even Xue Chao himself was incomparably shocked. He retreated a few steps and even forgot to attack.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was wild. The three concepts were entangled together. He held the spear in one hand and walked towards Xue Chao step by step.</p><p>“Xue Chao, bring out your full strength. I’m really disappointed that you only have this little bit of battle strength.”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you think you can fight me just because you’ve unleashed three intents? Naive, die!”</p><p>Xue Chao managed to calm himself down, but his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Kill, kill, he must kill Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s talent was too strong, and it made him tremble with fear.</p><p>As for Qiu changkong, his face had long since turned pale.</p><p>“Thousand purple lightning sword slash!”</p><p>Xue Chao bellowed and raised his strength to the peak. He slashed out with his combat sword, sending countless Thunderbolt sword Qi towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ten thousand Dragon kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the second move of the three wonders of the Dragon God.</p><p>Wind, fire, and lightning-the three intents merged together and pierced out with the spear.</p><p>Dragon roars were heard as countless small two-colored true dragons flew out and attacked the sword Qi.</p><p>That’s right, it was only two colors because the Thunder mentality hadn’t completely merged with the Wind and Fire mentality.</p><p>Although he did not merge them, the addition of the Thunder concept still greatly increased Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The lightning sword Qi collided with the two-colored true dragon and exploded like fireworks.</p><p>In just a few breaths, thousands of explosions were heard.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With two loud shouts, Lu Ming and Xue Chao shuttled through the surging energy tide and collided heavily.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them kept clashing. The sword Qi and the spear radiance shot up tens of thousands of meters into the sky, stirring the clouds.</p><p>At the scene, everyone held their breath and watched the battle between the two in a daze.</p><p>“It’s not enough, the pressure is not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Although Xue Chao was slightly stronger than him, it was very limited. It was very difficult for him to give him enough pressure to fuse the Wind and Fire forces.</p><p>“Xue Chao, is this all you’ve got? Martial King? I think you’re the trashiest martial King, aren’t you? If I were you, I’d just destroy my own cultivation.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p>Although Xue Chao had just broken through to martial King not long ago, he was definitely not the worst martial King.</p><p>One had to know that Xue Chao himself was a terrifying genius. During the martial arts Grandmaster era, he was a four battle genius. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been chosen by the Thunder Palace Master as a disciple.</p><p>Even if he was a four-time Warrior of the martial arts Grandmaster stage, he would not be the worst after breaking through to the martial King stage. His combat strength would not be too weak either. However, in Lu Ming’s words, he was the worst martial King.</p><p>Thunder Palace master’s lips trembled in anger.</p><p>As for Xue Chao, he was so angry that his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>From the start of the battle until now, Xue Chao knew that he was destined to become a laughingstock. However, he still had a chance. As long as he defeated Lu Ming, he could at least save some face.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and bellowed,”Lu Ming, you’re the one who forced me to do this. You forced me to do this!”</p><p>Xue Chao roared. Soon after, his finger glowed and a medicinal pill appeared. He swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After Xue Chao swallowed this pill, the true essence in his body went berserk as if it had gone mad. It became turbulent and surged, becoming twice as strong as before.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s eyes were bloodshot and his long hair fluttered in the wind. He held the Thunder sword in his hand and charged towards Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>The strength of his primeval essence had doubled, greatly increasing Xue Chao’s battle strength.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xue Chao exchanged a blow. He felt a surge of violent energy surging towards him and his body could not help but retreat.</p><p>what a powerful force! Haha, this is just right!</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>However, the scene was in chaos.</p><p>“That’s an explosive Yuan pill! Xue Chao actually consumed an explosive Yuan pill, how despicable!”</p><p>“Explosive Yuan pill. Once consumed, one’s Zhen Qi will go berserk and double its previous strength. However, the side effect is also very strong. After the medicinal effect wears off, one’s Zhen Yuan will become impure and even become dispirited. There will be a long period of weakness, and one will need to pay a considerable price to recover.”</p><p>“Hehe, especially for someone like Xue Chao who has just broken through. The explosive Yuan pill is equivalent to a poison pill. If it’s not handled properly, the path of martial arts in the future can be considered to be cut off.”</p><p>“He’s been forced into a corner.”</p><p>The surroundings were filled with discussions.</p><p>“Thunder Palace Master, Xue Chao has already broken the rules.”</p><p>In the sky, the wind Palace Master looked at the Thunder Palace Master and said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Violation? How is it against the rules? before the competition, there was no rule that forbade the use of external forces.”</p><p>Thunder Palace Master said with a cold face.</p><p>“You … You’re really despicable!”</p><p>The palace Master of wind was furious, but he was also helpless. Indeed, before the competition, who would have thought of this, who would have thought that Xue Chao would use external forces?</p><p>Everyone thought that Xue Chao would win for sure. They were not worried that Lu Ming would use external forces, which was considered good.</p><p>“Die, you little bastard, die!”</p><p>In the crowd, Sheng Wushuang growled.</p><p>This battle was not only related to his reputation, but also to 30000 Supreme spiritual crystals. He naturally paid special attention to it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the battle on the fighting ring continued.</p><p>With the help of the explosive Yuan pill’s medicinal power, Xue Chao frantically attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die, die!”</p><p>Xue Chao bellowed, his hatred for Lu Ming seeped deep into his bones.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
