He slowly descended and landed on the ground.</p><p>“Indeed, flying is not allowed on the hundred deities slope!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then looked around.</p><p>It was very strange. Everything was normal outside, but once he flew into the gray fog, not only could he not fly, but even the surrounding environment had changed.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was a gray desert.</p><p>Yes, it was all desert, not a single blade of grass could be seen.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and strode forward.</p><p>However, not long after, Lu Ming’s expression changed again.</p><p>That was because he felt that his cultivation level was being suppressed and kept dropping.</p><p>It had not been long since his cultivation was suppressed to the middle stage of martial ancestor 9-dan.</p><p>it’s one thing to hear the rumors, but it’s another to feel it for myself. It’s not a good feeling to watch your cultivation level drop continuously!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Then, he couldn’t be bothered and continued to run forward.</p><p>According to the experience of his predecessors, the deeper he went into the hundred deities slope, the more opportunities he would be able to obtain.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming’s cultivation had been completely suppressed. He could not circulate his essential Qi at all. He was no different from an ordinary person who had not cultivated.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s physical strength was extremely strong. He had already achieved the sixth stage physical body, so he could still retain some combat power.</p><p>Furthermore, his use of force and intent wasn’t suppressed.</p><p>However, since he could not use his essential Qi, Lu Ming’s speed had been reduced by many times. He could only travel like an ordinary person.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles bulged and he ran across the desert like an agile monkey.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming stopped. He felt a strange wave of fluctuation spreading toward him.</p><p>A ray of blue light was floating in the air.</p><p>“This is the domain of the heaven and earth, the domain of water!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>On the hundred deities slope, one of the fortuitous encounters was to encounter this kind of heaven and earth intent realm floating in the air.</p><p>According to the speculations of the experts, this essence realm of heaven and earth should have been left behind by the corpses that had fallen here.</p><p>Those powerful existences had comprehended the intent of heaven and earth to an incredible level and merged it with their own will. After death, the intent of heaven and earth didn’t dissipate and would wander around the world. If one could encounter it and comprehend it, they would have great gains.</p><p>This was because the intent realms of heaven and earth seemed to have been tamed by someone, and it was much easier to comprehend them.</p><p>One wisp was worth at least several intent crystals.</p><p>unfortunately, it’s the water concept. I can’t use it now!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and left the place reluctantly.</p><p>He continued to move forward and walked around.</p><p>Lu Ming did not encounter anything for the next two days. He did not even encounter a wisp of the essence realm of heaven and earth, let alone any treasure.</p><p>On the third day, Lu Ming encountered a wisp of the creation of Earth, which made him sigh with misfortune.</p><p>However, on the seventh day, Lu Ming’s luck came and he encountered a wisp of fire concept.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming used his own power to entangle this wisp of the essence realm of heaven and earth and began to comprehend it.</p><p>Following Lu Ming’s comprehension, this wisp of intent realm of heaven and earth began to dissipate slowly like an intent crystal.</p><p>It was no wonder that the quota to enter the hundred deities slope was so precious. That was because the intent realm of heaven and earth that wandered within the hundred deities slope would decrease.</p><p>Perhaps after a few years, the hundred deities slope would no longer be so attractive.</p><p>A day later, the intent completely dissipated and Lu Ming’s comprehension of the fire Force had greatly deepened.</p><p>He was getting closer and closer to comprehending a trace of fire concept.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming continued to spin.</p><p>On the eleventh day of Lu Ming’s entry to the hundred deities slope, he once again encountered a wisp of the essence realm of heaven and earth that was useful to him.</p><p>Thunder concept!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and began to comprehend.</p><p>The force of lightning had advanced by leaps and bounds. With this wisp of Heaven Earth intent, the force of lightning had reached major completion.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated three types of forces. This was one of his advantages at the hundred deities slope. He could easily encounter the concepts of heaven and earth that were useful to him.</p><p>If one had only comprehended one type of force, it would be much more difficult to encounter the corresponding force.</p><p>Perhaps they wouldn’t be able to encounter it more than a few times in three months.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s luck seemed to have run out after that. For seven consecutive days, he did not encounter a single trace of Shi.</p><p>I’m really unlucky. I’ve been spinning around all day and can’t even cultivate my true Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He could smell the faint scent of medicine coming from the front.</p><p>“What’s going on? There’s desert everywhere, not a drop of water, not even a blade of grass, so how could there be a medicinal fragrance?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious and followed the scent of the medicine.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw some rocks standing in the desert.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming saw rocks in the hundred deities slope. The hundred deities slope was filled with desert and sand.</p><p>“There’s water and a spiritual herb!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the pile of rocks and was surprised to find that there was a small pool in the middle of the pile of rocks. It was less than one meter in length and width.</p><p>There was a clear spring in the pond, which emitted an astonishing amount of spiritual Qi and life essence.</p><p>In the spring, there was a blade of grass. The grass’s leaves were thin and long. It had eight leaves, each of which was like a sword.</p><p>The leaves were green and luscious.</p><p>there is actually a plant growing on the hundred deities slope. It is really amazing. Furthermore, I can feel that this sword-shaped plant is actually emitting an extremely powerful sword intent!</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>perhaps there was a Supreme Being’s corpse that fell here. Its essence turned into this spring, and its intent turned into this sword-shaped plant.</p><p>amazing, these two things are both amazing. This clear spring contains a strong life force and can be used to cultivate top-tier spirit herbs!</p><p>and this sword-shaped plant, if a sword cultivator touched it, he would definitely treat it as a treasure and learn the sword way from it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and he was extremely excited.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a Jade box and carefully placed a stream of clear spring water and the sword-shaped plant into it.</p><p>Not even a drop of spring water was left in the small pool.</p><p>wait, I wonder if it’s useful for the two branches to cultivate spiritual herbs? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He suddenly thought of the two withered branches that spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>With a thought, two dried branches appeared in his hands. He then placed the two dried branches into the clear spring in the jade box and soaked them in.</p><p>“Let’s wait for a while and see if it’s useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the jade box in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been at the hundred deities slope for one and a half months.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had encountered a wisp of wind concept and a wisp of fire concept.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension of the concept of wind had advanced another step.</p><p>As for the force of fire, it had even achieved a qualitative leap, comprehending a trace of the concept of fire in one go.</p><p>Lu Ming’s power of fire had finally advanced to an intent realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin after he had comprehended a trace of the Wind and Fire forces. At the same time, he could begin to cultivate the third stage of the Dragon God’s three absolutes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
