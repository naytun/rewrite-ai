His sword fingers turned into a palm, and he slapped Jian Fengyun’s shoulder.</p><p>...</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s body trembled and he knelt down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jian Fengyun fell to his knees in front of Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun struggled with all his might. His eyes were red.</p><p>This was worse than death. He would rather die than kneel in front of Qiu changkong.</p><p>However, with a flash of lightning from Qiu changkong’s palm, Jian Fengyun’s body shuddered and he was no longer able to resist.</p><p>“Brother Jian!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu roared, a powerful aura rising from his body.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, don’t go too far!”</p><p>Jiang hongwen and the others also shouted.</p><p>They were shocked to see that Qiu changkong’s combat strength had increased so much in just three months.</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s cultivation had improved by a huge margin, but he was still defeated by Qiu changkong in a single move. He was forced to his knees.</p><p>How could Qiu changkong be so powerful? What kind of fortuitous encounter did he have?</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes turned cold as he looked at Jiang hongwen and the others.”What’s wrong? You want to interfere? Are you looking to die?”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Qiu changkong’s body exploded with killing intent and a powerful aura. It was as if an ancient beast had awakened.</p><p>The powerful aura forced Jiang hongwen and the others to retreat, their faces full of fear.</p><p>At this moment, the strongest experts of the Super regions were all looking at Qiu changkong with grave expressions.</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Zang Sheng also looked at Qiu changkong, a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Seeing the expressions on Jiang hongwen and the others ‘faces, Qiu changkong let out a cold laugh and revealed a satisfied expression. He looked down at Jian Fengyun and said, Jian Fengyun, I won’t kill you today. I’ll let you see with your own eyes who is the strongest in the Cloud King Mountain range. Haha!</p><p>Qiu changkong looked at Jian Fengyun with disdain and laughed heartily.</p><p>Jian Fengyun clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his flesh, causing blood to flow.</p><p>“You’re just a piece of trash!”</p><p>Qiu changkong laughed in disdain, feeling extremely carefree.</p><p>The most powerful man in the cloud Emperor mountain range was still kneeling in front of him. Next, he was going to become the eastern sky Divine Guard of the four sky divine guards and make all the other geniuses bow down to him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the 27 altars suddenly started to shake and gave off a bright light.</p><p>“The array has been activated. We have to leave this place and take part in the final assessment!”</p><p>“This time, I’ll definitely become an Emperor sky Divine Guard!”</p><p>“Sigh, I’ll be satisfied as long as I can become a reserve Ditian Divine Guard!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The twenty-seven altars glowed with light and inscriptions. After a while, the light from the twenty-seven altars gathered together and a huge Whirlpool appeared above the altars.</p><p>the teleportation path to the final assessment has been opened. All you have to do is enter the whirlpool and you will arrive at the final assessment location!</p><p>A deep and majestic voice came from the vortex.</p><p>haha, the final assessment has begun. Let’s go!</p><p>Zang Sheng laughed and flew into the whirlpool, disappearing.</p><p>The rest of the people from the Dragon burial abyss followed closely behind.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>More than 10000 people flew into the whirlpool and disappeared like locusts.</p><p>Hmph, that Lu Ming is not here yet. It seems that he has died somewhere.</p><p>Qiu changkong coldly snorted.</p><p>Then, he looked into the distance with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that just because you’re dead, I won’t be able to get the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure. Once I become an empyrean heaven Divine Guard and flatten the mystic essence sword sect, I’ll get the news of the Martial Emperor’s treasure from your father. Hehe, don’t think that I can’t do anything just because that old man swore to die and refused to obey!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s mind raced as he looked at Jian Fengyun. He kicked Jian Fengyun away and said, ” “Trash, get lost!”</p><p>Then, he moved and rushed toward the vortex, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Brother Jian, how are you?”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu, Jiang hongwen, and the others quickly went over to help Jian Fengyun up.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun said as he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>sigh, I didn’t expect Qiu changkong’s cultivation to have reached such a level. It’s truly shocking!</p><p>Jiang hongwen sighed.</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s expression was ugly. He didn’t say much. He looked into the distance and said in a low voice,”Lu Ming, did something really happen to you? He’s already dead?”</p><p>Lu Ming had not arrived yet. It was very likely that there was a problem.</p><p>Suddenly, Jian Fengyun’s expression changed. He saw a ray of light rapidly approaching from the horizon.</p><p>This ray of light was too fast. It arrived here in an instant.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu jianfengyun was overjoyed.</p><p>The light faded and Lu Ming’s body was revealed.</p><p>Lu Ming was as fast as lightning and he finally arrived.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I knew you would be fine.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun was ecstatic.</p><p>“Haha, brother Lu!”</p><p>Xiao Haoyu also stepped forward to greet him.</p><p>At the side, Jiang hongwen and the rest were extremely puzzled. Wasn’t it just Lu Ming? Did Jian Fengyun have to be so excited?</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he had barely made it into the top ten in the previous qualifiers. What was there to be happy about?</p><p>“Eh? Brother Jian, you’re injured, and it seems like you’ve just been injured. Who injured you?”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that Jian Fengyun was injured at a glance. Although the injury was not serious, Lu Ming could tell with one look.</p><p>“Haha, I’m fine. It’s just a small injury!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Jian Fengyun seemed to be afraid of something and did not tell the truth.</p><p>“Brother Jian, why hide it? Lu Ming, let me tell you. This matter is all because of you!”</p><p>Jiang hongwen shouted from the side.</p><p>“Brother Jiang, say no more!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun wanted to stop him.</p><p>“Because of me?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>that’s right, it’s all because of you. I know that you and Qiu changkong come from the same Empire and have a grudge against each other. Just now, Qiu changkong couldn’t find you, so he took out his anger on brother Jian!</p><p>Jiang hongwen said loudly.</p><p>“Qiu changkong? He’s actually this strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right. I don’t know what kind of fortuitous encounter Qiu changkong had, but his cultivation base is terrifyingly strong. Lu Ming, let me remind you, if you encounter Qiu changkong, you should stay as far away as possible. I’m just giving you a friendly reminder, don’t doubt me!”</p><p>Jiang hongwen said.</p><p>The other geniuses in the cloud Emperor mountain range nodded.</p><p>brother Lu, Qiu changkong is indeed powerful now. You might not be a match for him!</p><p>Jian Fengyun sighed.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile and a murderous intent flashed across his eyes.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic and did not say anything else.</p><p>Everyone nodded and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>When Lu Ming rushed into the vortex, the familiar feeling of the world spinning around him happened again. After a while, Lu Ming found himself standing on a platform paved with white jade.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>The three sides of the platform were blurry like chaos, and the last side was a flight of stairs.</p><p>The stairs were completely paved with white jade, and they went straight up.</p><p>this is the thousand-step Jade staircase. Only those who can climb it will be considered as reserve Emperor heaven divine guards. Those who can’t climb it will be eliminated!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
