Judging from the direction he’s headed, he should be heading towards the house of mystical treasures. Hurry up and send a message to senior brother Xue.”</p><p>When Lu Ming left the eastern sky courtyard, a young man appeared in the clouds in the distance.</p><p>He took out a ten-thousand-mile sound-transmitting talisman and sent a message.</p><p>Lu Ming did not go at a very fast speed. There were many people in the air. If he went too fast, he was afraid that something might happen.</p><p>After a long while, the mystical Treasure Hall came into sight.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold shout reverberated across the world.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and turned around. Behind him, two young men were Walking in the Air.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned at the sight of the two of them.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, and it’s him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>One of them was Qiu changkong.</p><p>As for the other young man in purple, Lu Ming recognized him with a single glance. He was the young man who had come to the mystic essence sword to distribute the invitation letter for the selection of the Emperor sky divine guards.</p><p>Qiu changkong and Xue Chao arrived before Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“What business do you have with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>“What business do you have? Haha, Lu Ming, you’ve forgotten so quickly. Three months ago, you talked back to the master of the lightning Palace in front of everyone. That was outrageous.”</p><p>“There’s no harm in telling you that I am the third disciple of the Thunder Palace Master, Xue Chao. Today, I will seek justice for my master!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s face was gloomy as he stared at Lu Ming and berated him loudly.</p><p>The sound was very loud and spread far and wide, even the people in the mystical Treasure Hall were alarmed.</p><p>that’s Xue Chao and Lu Ming. I heard that Lu Ming disrespected the Thunder Palace Master three months ago. It seems like Xue Chao is going to find trouble with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yeah? Lu Ming is arrogant. He’s finished this time!”</p><p>“Hehe, there’s a good show to watch!”</p><p>The sound of air being torn rang out continuously, and hundreds of people surrounded the crowd.</p><p>“Seek justice?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He laughed and said, what a joke. That day, I went to the Thunder Palace according to the normal procedure to listen to the lesson. The Thunder Palace Master wanted to chase me away for no reason. How could I not talk back to such an act? ”</p><p>“There’s a saying that if the Emperor breaks the law, he should be punished with the common people. So what if he’s the palace master of thunder Palace? He’s at fault, why can’t I say anything?”</p><p>“Impudent, arrogant!”</p><p>Xue Chao shouted, his gaze pressing,”How dare you, Lu Ming! My master is the master of the Thunder Palace. He has made great contributions to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and has a respected status. How can an ant like you talk back to him? you still dare to be so arrogant and show disrespect to my master?”</p><p>my master is a broad-minded person. He won’t lower himself to your level. However, as his disciple, I can’t just sit by and do nothing. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of my master!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After saying that, Xue Chao’s body exploded with an incomparably terrifying aura.</p><p>The aura was so powerful that it caused the space to tremble.</p><p>At the side, some people couldn’t withstand this aura and retreated frantically.</p><p>This was the aura of a King, the might of a King.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Back at the mystic essence sword sect, Xue Chao was only a half-step King. He didn’t think that after not seeing him for a while, Xue Chao would have already broken through to the king realm.</p><p>To be able to break through to the king’s realm at this age was already very rare.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The aura of a King pressed down on Lu Ming like an ancient divine mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved slightly to resist the pressure.</p><p>“Xue Chao is about to make his move. Lu Ming is finished!”</p><p>he deserves it. Lu Ming is so arrogant and self-righteous. I’ve long expected that I would be at a disadvantage. Now that Xue Chao is teaching Lu Ming a lesson in the name of being a substitute teacher, it’s only reasonable!</p><p>“As expected, it’s better to keep a low profile. Otherwise, you won’t even know how you died!”</p><p>“If he wasn’t so full of himself and didn’t delude himself to cultivate several kinds of intent realms at the same time, he would have already taken the wind Palace Master as his master. If he had taken the wind Palace Master as his master, Xue Chao wouldn’t have dared to make things difficult for him.”</p><p>“Hmph, you only have yourself to blame!”</p><p>Many people who could not stand Lu Ming gloated and spoke coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kneel down and admit your mistake. I’ll spare you!”</p><p>Xue Chao shouted as he took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled and the space rumbled. Xue Chao’s kick seemed to have a tremendous force of a billion Jin, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>With this step, the aura on his body became even stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and kneel down to admit your mistake. Beg my senior brother to spare you!”</p><p>Qiu changkong shouted from the side.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, do you want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and filled with killing intent as he looked at Qiu changkong.</p><p>Qiu changkong instantly felt a chill run down his spine and his scalp went numb. He subconsciously took a few steps back.</p><p>“Hehe, coward!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re f * cking courting death!”</p><p>Qiu changkong came back to his senses. His face was flushed red as he pointed at Lu Ming and screamed madly.</p><p>“A rabid dog!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Qiu changkong indifferently, then at Xue Chao. With a wave of his hand, a spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Pointing the tip of the spear at Xue Chao, he said,”enough with the nonsense. If you want to fight, then let’s fight!.”</p><p>haha, you want to fight with me? since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>Xue Chao laughed heartily. Thunder and lightning surged around his body, and countless lightning bolts revolved around him, making him look like a Thunder God.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A tall figure suddenly appeared in the sky, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>This aura was so oppressive that everyone almost couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“How can we allow you to fight in the vicinity of the mystical Treasure Hall? if you want to fight, then go to the divine Guard platform!”</p><p>The tall figure let out a rolling roar.</p><p>“Protector!”</p><p>Seeing this figure, Xue Chao’s expression was incomparably grave.</p><p>There were only three protectors in each of the nine great halls of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and each of them was an extremely powerful existence.</p><p>Although Xue Chao had broken through to the martial King realm, he still had to be obedient in front of the Guardians.</p><p>I’ll leave my words here. If you still fight here, I won’t be polite!</p><p>let’s go, ” the protector said coldly. Then, he disappeared.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming. You’re lucky today. I’ll let you off for the time being. However, you’ll have to leave the Empyrean heaven divine Palace one day. I’ll teach you a lesson then!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s expression was unsightly as he coldly snorted.</p><p>“I’m lucky? Hehe, Xue Chao, if you want to find trouble with me, you can find trouble with me. Now you want to leave, how can there be such a good thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>“Eh? Lu Ming, what do you mean by this? Don’t tell me you still want to fight me?”</p><p>Xue Chao sneered.</p><p>“That’s right. Xue Chao, I’m now officially challenging you. Do you dare to fight against me on the divine guards” battle platform?”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and pointed it at Xue Chao as he shouted.</p><p>His voice swept out in all directions like a storm.</p><p>The scene instantly exploded.</p><p>“What? What? Lu Ming actually took the initiative to challenge Xue Chao. Did I hear him wrong?”</p><p>“Crazy, Lu Ming is crazy!”</p><p>“Is he blind? can’t he see that Xue Chao is already at the martial King realm? You still dare to challenge me?”</p><p>I think he’s too arrogant. He’s so young, but he’s already gotten carried away with a little bit of achievement. Ridiculous, really ridiculous. He actually dares to challenge a King tier? ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
