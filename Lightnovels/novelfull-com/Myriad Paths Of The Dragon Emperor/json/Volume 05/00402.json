The entire space boiled as if it was about to explode.</p><p>Sword Qi, saber radiance, fist force, spear radiance, and many other things gathered together and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped heavily on the ground and his figure retreated rapidly. He retreated a thousand meters in an instant. Then, he took a deep breath and his figure suddenly rose.</p><p>“Heaven’s path palm!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and waved his palm. The spirit Qi between heaven and earth instantly boiled and was drawn over. A huge palm print was formed and blasted towards Jiang wantian and the others.</p><p>The palm print had yet to arrive, but the terrifying Qi movement already made it difficult for everyone to breathe.</p><p>Jiang wantian and the other geniuses from the thousand River region were shocked because the power of this palm was too terrifying.</p><p>not good! Hold on! We must hold on!</p><p>Jiang wantian roared.</p><p>“Raging waves and stormy waves palm!”</p><p>Jiang wantian bellowed and struck out with his palm. A huge River formed, and with the power of the raging waves, it blasted towards the heaven Dao palm print.</p><p>At the same time, all sorts of sword gleams and fist forces exploded out toward the heaven Dao palm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With so many people joining forces, the might was truly terrifying. All sorts of attacks slammed into the heaven path palm print, causing loud rumbles to ring out continuously. After each rumbles, the might of the heaven path palm print would weaken by a little.</p><p>By the time the 20-plus attacks were exhausted, the heaven’s path palm print’s power was also nearly exhausted.</p><p>“Haha, he blocked it!”</p><p>Someone in the thousand River region laughed.</p><p>They thought that Lu Ming could only unleash such a powerful attack once at most.</p><p>“Why are you so happy? The second palm!”</p><p>A calm voice rang out as the second heaven’s path palm print was formed.</p><p>“Ah? Why are there more!”</p><p>The experts of the thousand River region were in despair. Then, they burst out with all their strength and attacked.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, it clashed with the heaven path palm print.</p><p>But this time, before the second palm print could cancel out, a third palm print formed in the sky and slammed down.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Jiang wantian and the others shouted in fear and despair.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The third palm print slammed down, and they could no longer resist it.</p><p>Some of the 7th level martial ancestor realm experts ‘bodies cracked as they were hit to the ground by the palm force and died instantly.</p><p>A few of the 8th grade martial ancestor realm experts also spat out large mouthfuls of blood and fell to the ground. They were all seriously injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give them any chance. With a wave of his hand, he condensed more than ten long Spears and shot them out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Jiang Wanchun and the others were all pierced by the long spear and nailed to the ground.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the top 20 geniuses of the thousand River region were all killed.</p><p>At the scene, the remaining people looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>“Heavens, heavens, how could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Li qiushui and Jiang Chun, who were from the thousand River region, widened their eyes in shock. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed one of the top twenty geniuses in the thousand River region. How was this possible?</p><p>They broke out in cold sweat and trembled.</p><p>Young master Tian she, Yan feixun, and the others were similar to li qiushui and the others. They were so scared that their guts were about to burst.</p><p>“Haven’t you two always wanted to attack me? Now, I’ll give you a chance. Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to li qiushui and Jiang Chun.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Li autumn water was at a loss for words. Suddenly, he knelt down with a plop and let out a miserable cry.”Lu Ming, no, brother Lu, no, Master Lu, I was blind. You’re a true dragon in the sky, and I’m just a pitiful worm. Please spare me!”</p><p>Plop!</p><p>As soon as li qiushui finished speaking, another kneeling sound was heard. It was Jiang Chun.</p><p>Jiang Chun was even more exaggerated. He was practically prostrating himself on the ground as he shouted, ” young hero Lu, please spare me. I have an eighty-year-old mother and an unmarried wife. They will rely on me in the future. As long as you spare me, I will be willing to be your slave in the future.</p><p>He screamed so miserably that it really made people cry.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned. He had been in this world for so long but this was the first time he had seen such a weirdo.</p><p>Martial artists were all prideful. Even if they were afraid of death, they would not shamelessly beg for mercy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t listen to them. As far as I know, Jiang Chun doesn’t have an eighty-year-old mother or a fiancée. He’s defiled quite a number of young girls from good families!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun shouted.</p><p>“Jian, you … Why are you trying to harm me?”</p><p>Jiang Chun roared.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, he waved his hand and two spearlights flew out. Li autumn water and Jiang Chun did not even have time to react and were nailed to the ground.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>There were still dozens of young men left in the thousand River region, and they were running for their lives.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance but did not pursue.</p><p>Most of the young men from the thousand River region had no grudges with him. Lu Ming was not a bloodthirsty person and would not kill them all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, young master Tian she and the others were also running in one direction.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over coldly. Then, he took a step forward and his figure flashed. When he reappeared, he was already in front of young master Tian she and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? I know you’re from the blazing sun Empire. If you dare to touch me, my family will definitely trample your Empire to the ground!”</p><p>Young master Tian she was so scared that his face turned pale as he shouted.</p><p>“As long as all of you are dead, who will know it’s me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently. He looked at Jian Fengyun and said,”Brother Jian, why don’t we do this? I’ll leave these people to you.”</p><p>Since they wanted to kill Jian Fengyun, it would be perfect to let Jian Fengyun take care of it.</p><p>“Good, just what I want!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun flew over and looked at young master Tian she with cold eyes.</p><p>“Wei tianshe, die!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun shouted coldly and unsheathed his sword. The powerful sword Qi pressed toward young master Tian she.</p><p>Jian Fengyun, don’t think that I’m afraid of you. Let’s see who’s stronger today.</p><p>Seeing that he couldn’t escape, young master Tian she went all out.</p><p>“Myriad snake sword technique!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Dense sword Qi suddenly shot out from young master Tian she’s hand. The sword Qi was like a venomous snake, heading towards Jian Fengyun.</p><p>“One sword, the wind and clouds rise!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun said softly. Then, a beam of sword light suddenly rose and cut through the void. All the sword Qi released by young master Tian she was destroyed by the sword.</p><p>“Second sword, river of blood!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword wind and cloud combined with the human world, and the sword light flashed.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Young master Tian she’s throat suddenly burst out with blood.</p><p>One sword to break the roar!</p><p>“Jian Fengyun, you …”</p><p>Young master Tian she let out a hiss and died.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Yan feixun was so shocked that he almost peed his pants. He turned around and ran.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of sword light, Yan feixun’s head flew high up into the air.</p><p>Then, with a flash of sword light, the remaining people in the cloud Emperor mountain range all died under Jian Fengyun’s sword.</p><p>“A traitor doesn’t need to live in this world.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun murmured. He shook his sword, and the blood on it flew out. Then, he sheathed his sword.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
