It was too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was able to fight to a draw with him. He even suspected that Lu Ming was the strongest person in a certain super area.</p><p>Not only Huang chixuan, but the people who were watching the battle were also stunned.</p><p>They originally thought that Lu Ming was definitely not Huang chixuan’s opponent. They thought that Lu Ming was overestimating his own ability and was courting death.</p><p>However, the truth was like a tight slap to their faces.</p><p>Not only was Lu Ming powerful, he was not weaker than Huang chixuan. He was a genius on the same level as Huang chixuan.</p><p>They were so shocked that their jaws almost dropped.</p><p>Bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and even Xuan Feng, who had been expressionless all this while, looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s ability had attracted their attention.</p><p>Especially the triangular-eyed young man in the Phoenix Lake area. He was covered in cold sweat and his body was trembling in fear.</p><p>Just now, he had wanted to deal with Lu Ming. If he had really made a move, he would not even know how he died.</p><p>When he thought of this, he felt a lingering fear.</p><p>“Who am I? You don’t have the right to know!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You’re pretending to be mysterious. Watch how I kill you!”</p><p>Huang chixuan let out a long roar and with a wave of his arms, the Phoenix spread its wings, bringing with it a gust of wind and a hot aura filled the world.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a loud rumbling sound came from the lake. The Dragon Mountain’s mouth seemed to have increased its suction force, and the water in the lake was frantically pouring into the dragon’s mouth.</p><p>There wasn’t much water left in the lake, and at this moment, the bottom of the lake was quickly seen.</p><p>“Ah? Look, the bottom of the lake is actually empty.”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>it’s really empty. Amazing. The bottom of the lake is empty. Why is there water? ”</p><p>amazing, it’s too amazing. Dragon’s Lair, this is the dragon’s lair, the dwelling place of the true dragon!</p><p>Some of the people who were close to the lake cried out in surprise.</p><p>now, you’re lucky. I’ll spare your life today!</p><p>Huang chixuan’s eyes flashed as he stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Spare my life? Aren’t you afraid of twisting your tongue? it’s still not certain who will kill who?”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a contemptuous smile.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s face turned gloomy. He really wanted to have a big fight with Lu Ming, but he was afraid of missing the dragon’s cave.</p><p>“Kid, just you wait!: He snorted.</p><p>Then, he led the people of Phoenix Lake and flew toward the surface of the lake.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and flew toward the lake.</p><p>His thoughts were similar to Huang chixuan’s. If the two of them were to have a life and death battle, it would be difficult to determine the winner in a short period of time. Then, they would have missed the dragon’s cave.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised when he flew in to take a look.</p><p>At this time, the water in the lake was getting less and less, revealing a huge dark cave below.</p><p>That’s right, this Lake wasn’t a lake at all, but the entrance of a huge cave. The lake water from before was actually just floating at the entrance of the cave, making it look like a lake.</p><p>When the lake water was sucked dry, its true appearance was revealed.</p><p>In just a dozen breaths, the water in the lake was completely sucked dry, and the huge cave was completely exposed.</p><p>The diameter of the cave was at least a few thousand meters wide. It was pitch black below. With everyone’s eyesight, they could only see a distance of one or two thousand meters. Anything further down could not be seen clearly.</p><p>It was unknown how deep the cave was, but it seemed to lead to the abyss of hell.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Someone moved and flew towards the cave.</p><p>He was safe and sound.</p><p>With someone taking the lead, the others naturally rushed in like a swarm of bees.</p><p>There were more than a hundred people in the three super regions, but all of them were terrifying geniuses. The weaker ones probably didn’t come.</p><p>Otherwise, it was impossible for a super region to have so few people.</p><p>Even the cloud Emperor mountain range had 98 people.</p><p>The largest number of people were those from the larger regions. In total, there were no less than 500 people.</p><p>More than six hundred people flew towards the huge cave.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He followed the crowd and rushed down.</p><p>The cave was too big. They had flown down for at least 10000 meters. At this time, the cave did not go straight down, but slanted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a huge battle broke out on the wall of the cave.</p><p>“Get lost, the Dragon’s saliva is mine.”</p><p>“Who said it’s yours? I was the one who discovered it first.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The next moment, a scream was heard. One of them was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sharp. He saw a young man plucking a green spiritual herb from the wall of the cave.</p><p>“Dragon’s saliva, it’s really Dragon’s saliva.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Dragon’s saliva was said to be the saliva of a true dragon. It was a spiritual herb that had grown over a long period of time. It contained the aura of a true dragon and was extremely precious.</p><p>It seemed that there really was a true Dragon’s dwelling here in the distant past.</p><p>“There’s one here too!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“It’s mine,”</p><p>“You’re courting death. You think you can get the Dragon grass?”</p><p>A great battle erupted, and the slaughter began.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, screams rose and fell.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s figure flashed and five to six young experts had their hearts crushed by him.</p><p>a bunch of trash. How dare you think of getting the Dragon’s saliva? die!</p><p>Huang chixuan said coldly.</p><p>“Go, whoever sees the Dragon’s saliva, seize it!”</p><p>Huang chixuan instructed the experts of Phoenix Lake.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Immediately, the dozens of Masters of Phoenix Lake scattered and flew to different parts of the cave.</p><p>It was not only the Phoenix Lake, but also the people in the Yangquan Valley area and the red flame mountain area.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Some of the experts from the larger regions roared.</p><p>Before entering the dragon’s cave, the reason why Huang chixuan and the others let people from large areas in was that they were afraid that people from large areas would join forces.</p><p>After all, there were geniuses above the eighth level of the martial ancestor realm in every large region. Once they joined forces, they would be a terrifying force.</p><p>But now that they had entered the dragon’s cave, everyone was thinking about treasure hunting and doing things their own way. How could they still join forces? Huang chixuan and the others were naturally unscrupulous.</p><p>In the cave, treasure snatching, killing, and screams could be heard from time to time.</p><p>“Two stalks of Dragon’s saliva!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw two green spiritual herbs on the stone wall of a cave. They were Dragon saliva grass.</p><p>His figure moved and he rushed over. On the side, there were others who saw him, but they didn’t dare to snatch it from him.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the two Dragon’s saliva.</p><p>He continued to fly along the walls of the cave.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>In front of them, a genius from Phoenix Lake had killed a young man with a single strike. He was so ecstatic that he was about to pluck a stalk of Dragon’s saliva from the wall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and used his essential Qi to pluck the Dragon’s saliva and put it away.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man from Phoenix Lake shouted angrily. However, when he saw that it was Lu Ming, he immediately swallowed his words.</p><p>He unwillingly retreated.</p><p>After more than ten minutes, they had flown another tens of thousands of meters. Three caves suddenly appeared in front of them.</p><p>The cave split open.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The group randomly chose a cave and flew in. Each cave had more than a hundred people.</p><p>At least a hundred people had been killed along the way.</p><p>Of the six hundred people, there was a sharp decrease of five hundred.</p><p>Lu Ming chose the cave on the left and flew along the stone wall.</p><p>“Wait, that’s the Dragonblood flower?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a patch of bright red spiritual flowers in a pit in the stone wall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
