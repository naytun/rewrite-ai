These twenty people were in different positions and were far away from each other.</p><p>Some people were sitting cross-legged, as if they were comprehending something.</p><p>Some of them were looking at the sword marks on the cliff wall seriously.</p><p>At this point, they could see even more clearly. On the huge cliff wall, there was a slanted sword mark that was more than 100 meters long. It was deeply engraved on the cliff wall and was filled with an ancient aura. No one knew how long it had been passed down.</p><p>An extremely profound sword essence spread out.</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the sword mark carefully.</p><p>All of a sudden, the sword mark enlarged in Lu Ming’s eyes. In the end, the entire world changed.</p><p>The heavens and earth turned into a battlefield, and the shouts of ‘kill’ suppressed the heavens.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light came from afar. It was boundless and indescribable. When the sword light came out, the sky was split.</p><p>The sword gleam was getting closer and closer to Lu Ming. It contained an unparalleled killing intent.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The environment changed. Lu Ming realized that he was still under the cliff. He took three steps back, leaving three footprints on the ground.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. The sword attack just now was like facing the god of death.</p><p>Around him, some people glanced at him and then turned their heads away, not finding it strange.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you alright?”</p><p>Jian Fengyun looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>brother Lu, you are truly a peerless talent. You were able to stay in that sword intent for half an hour, and when you woke up, you only took three steps back. I only had ten minutes just now, and I almost vomited blood when I woke up!</p><p>Xiao Haoyu said with a smile.</p><p>it’s a pity that brother Lu doesn’t cultivate the sword. Otherwise, you’d definitely become a peerless swordsman!</p><p>Jian Feng Yun said.</p><p>“Half an hour?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised. Just now, he only felt that a while had passed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, half an hour had already passed.</p><p>brother Lu, brother Xiao and I plan to stay here to comprehend the sword intent here. I’m afraid we can’t go to the dragon’s cave with you!</p><p>Jian Fengyun looked at Lu Ming apologetically.</p><p>it doesn’t matter. This sword intent was probably left behind by a peerless swordsman. For a swordsman, it’s a Supreme opportunity. If I were a swordsman, I’d probably stay and cultivate too!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>They were all martial artists, so he could understand what Jian Fengyun and the others were thinking.</p><p>This sword scar was too tempting for a sword cultivator. It was hard to resist. If one could comprehend a trace of it, it would be very useful.</p><p>Compared to the dragon’s cave, this place was more practical for them.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was better for Jian Fengyun and the others to stay here. He would be able to do more by exploring the dragon’s cave alone.</p><p>“I hope that brother Lu will have a great harvest in the dragon’s cave!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun and Xiao Haoyu cupped their fists together.</p><p>“We’ll meet again!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, then turned into a ray of light, soared into the sky, and disappeared.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming no longer slowed down to search for the spiritual herbs. Instead, he flew at high speed.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming saw a few fights, but he ignored them and passed by them in a flash.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Half a day later, a majestic mountain range appeared in front of them.</p><p>This mountain range was at least a few thousand miles long. It was winding and laid on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming could barely see the outline of the mountain range from a few hundred miles away.</p><p>From afar, this mountain range really looked like a true dragon.</p><p>It had five dragon claws, and its body was covered in scales formed from various rocks. There were also two dragon horns on its head.</p><p>Its shape was exactly the same as the true dragon in the legends.</p><p>this is the legendary dragon Mountain. We’ve arrived at the dragon’s cave!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he quickly headed toward the dragon’s head.</p><p>As they neared, they discovered that this mountain range was truly too majestic. Its high point pierced through the clouds.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the dragon’s head, he realized that many people had already arrived. At a glance, there were no less than two thousand people.</p><p>More than two thousand people were scattered around a Lake, which was very wide.</p><p>Above the lake was the Dragon head of the Dragon Mountain.</p><p>The dragon’s head was open, revealing a dark cave. At that moment, something strange was happening.</p><p>The water in the lake formed a column from the bottom to the top and flew into the dragon’s mouth.</p><p>It looked like a real Dragon was absorbing water.</p><p>This was the phenomenon of a waterspout.</p><p>Legend had it that the real Dragon’s Den was right under this Lake. Once the lake water was sucked dry, the real Dragon’s Den would be revealed.</p><p>Thousands of people were waiting around the lake.</p><p>Lu Ming landed and mixed in with the crowd.</p><p>“Brother Fang, why are there only a few of you left in the flowing water Bay Area?”</p><p>Someone was chatting beside him.</p><p>sigh, the others are all dead. They were killed by people from the big areas. What about you guys? why don’t you have many people? ”</p><p>don’t mention it. We also encountered a big region and attacked without any reason. The strongest people in our region were killed. On the other hand, we, who are not strong, escaped the disaster. However, the people from the big region behind also died. I saw their bodies and their blood was sucked dry. It was extremely terrifying!</p><p>“What? Did you guys see the corpses that had their blood sucked dry? We also saw it. ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. It seemed that the incident of his blood being sucked dry was not only happening in the area that he had passed by, but also in other areas.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people gathered here.</p><p>After half a day, there were no less than three thousand people here.</p><p>A portion of the water on the lake’s surface had also been reduced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard.</p><p>Dozens of young men and women stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>Each of these people had a terrifying aura. They all had one thing in common: the men were very handsome and the women were beautiful.</p><p>“The people from Phoenix Lake area are here!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>it’s over. I didn’t expect that even the geniuses from the Phoenix Lake area would come. Are we still going to get a share of the dragon’s cave? ”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was moved.</p><p>He had naturally heard of the Phoenix Lake Region. It was a region that was even more powerful than a large region like the thousand River region. It was known as a super region.</p><p>In a large region, there would only be one high-tier Empire.</p><p>In a super region, there would be at least two, or even three or four, advanced empires.</p><p>They were extremely powerful and had many geniuses.</p><p>It was said that there were three high-level empires, medium-level empires, and low-level empires in the Phoenix Lake area. There were more than a thousand of them, which was much more powerful than the cloud Emperor mountain range area.</p><p>look, the one wearing the Phoenix robe is the strongest person in the Phoenix Lake Region, the number one genius, Chi chixuan. It’s said that he is a four battle genius and his cultivation has reached the peak of the 8th grade martial ancestor realm!</p><p>“What? A four-battle genius? The peak of martial ancestor 8-dan is that terrifying?”</p><p>“Of course, that’s the strongest person in a super region, he’s known as a peerless genius!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked over as well. Indeed, among the people from Phoenix Lake, he saw a handsome young man in his early twenties, who was dressed in a Phoenix robe.</p><p>He was Huang chixuan.</p><p>However, his eyes looked extremely cold and arrogant.</p><p>He was not the only one. The rest of the people from Phoenix Lake had similar expressions. They had cold and arrogant looks on their faces as they hovered in the air not far away from Lu Ming and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
