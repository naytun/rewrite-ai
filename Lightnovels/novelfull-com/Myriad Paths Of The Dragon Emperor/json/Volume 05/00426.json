There was nothing to say, and the battle immediately erupted.</p><p>These two people were both battle-hardened geniuses. However, one of them had already reached the early stage of the ninth martial ancestor realm, while the other was still at the peak of the eighth martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Naturally, the 9th level martial arts Grandmaster genius had the absolute advantage and defeated his opponent.</p><p>The battles continued, and geniuses stepped forward one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that some of the geniuses had extremely high cultivation levels. One of them was in the late stage of the ninth level martial ancestor realm, while the other was in the middle stage.</p><p>It was Xuan Feng’s turn. After not seeing him for some time, his cultivation had improved greatly and reached the middle of the martial arts Grandmaster 9-dan. He entered the second round with an absolute advantage.</p><p>Two hours later, all eight pairs of geniuses had finished their battles. The eight people who had entered the second round had all appeared.</p><p>Of course, including Lu Ming, who had a bye, there were nine people in total.</p><p>The other eight were eliminated just like that.</p><p>The middle-aged Guardian took back their Jade plates, leaving only the plates with the numbers 1 to 8. Of course, there was also the Jade plate for the bye.</p><p>The middle-aged protector waved his hand. Genuine Qi surged and covered the nine Jade tokens, wiping away all the traces on them.</p><p>He was doing this to prevent anyone from tampering with the Jade token and leaving behind an aura or mark.</p><p>Then, the nine Jade tablets floated in the air, emitting a hazy radiance.</p><p>&Nbsp; “the rules are the same as before. Here, there are eight Jade plates from number one to eight. Draw lots to decide your opponent. Number one to eight, number two to seven, and so on. Those who draw the empty Jade plate will directly enter the next round.”</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>“I’ll go first.”</p><p>It was still zang Sheng, who was extremely confident. With a wave of his hand, a Jade token was sucked into his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu changkong, Xuan Feng, and the rest each drew a Jade card.</p><p>“This time, who will get the bye card?”</p><p>In the audience, everyone’s eyes were bright and full of curiosity.</p><p>Although drawing the bye card might not necessarily mean winning the throne of the East heaven Divine Guard, it would greatly reduce the consumption of true Qi and physical strength, making the next round easier.</p><p>On the fighting ring, everyone looked at their Jade tokens.</p><p>Lu Ming also took a look at the Jade card. He was stunned.</p><p>Bye, Bye again.</p><p>Lu Ming actually drew the bye Jade card again.</p><p>my luck is too good. I got the bye Jade plate twice in a row!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, somewhat speechless.</p><p>To be honest, if he could, he really didn’t want to draw the Jade token. If he kept drawing empty tokens, how could he torture Qiu changkong?</p><p>“Now, give me your numbers!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector said.</p><p>“I’m number six!”</p><p>Zang Sheng was the first to speak.</p><p>“I’m number five!”</p><p>Qiu changkong replied.</p><p>“I’m number one!”</p><p>“I’ll be number three!”</p><p>The rest of the people reported their numbers one by one.</p><p>As the number of people decreased one by one, there were only two people left in the end.</p><p>One was Lu Ming and the other was a fat man with big eyes.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on the two of them.</p><p>there are only two people left. Lu Ming has not given his number yet. Could it be that he has a bye again? ”</p><p>it shouldn’t be possible. How could he draw the bye card twice in a row? ”</p><p>…</p><p>“I’m number eight!”</p><p>As the crowd was discussing, the large-eyed fatty flipped open the Jade card. He looked at Lu Ming with a complicated expression and announced the number loudly!</p><p>Immediately backing up</p><p>Wuwuwuwu</p><p>Countless gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest, it’s him again, it’s actually him again!”</p><p>“It’s really him. How is that possible? Is this some dog-shit luck?”</p><p>he’s really lucky. He got the bye card and directly entered the third round.</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar as they discussed.</p><p>In the elder-leading area, Lu Xiu was also stunned.</p><p>This works too?</p><p>Wouldn’t lu Ming directly enter the third round?</p><p>Countless envious gazes were directed at Lu Xiu.</p><p>Lu Ming’s good luck meant that Lu Xiu’s luck was good.</p><p>Although it was impossible for Lu Ming to become the eastern sky Divine Guard, Lu Xiu’s reward would be higher the higher his ranking was.</p><p>How could they not be jealous?</p><p>Jian Fengyun, Jiang hongwen, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even the middle-aged Guardian looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. He opened the Jade card and said helplessly, ” “I’m the bye card!”</p><p>As expected! It was him again!</p><p>Everyone roared in their hearts.</p><p>alright, now that the drawing of lots has ended, let’s begin the duel. Number one versus number eight!</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Two figures walked towards the center. One of them was the big-eyed fatty, and the other was Xuan Feng.</p><p>As for the others, they walked to the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re really lucky. However, it’s useless to rely on luck. In the end, you still have to rely on your abilities. The higher you climb with luck now, the worse you will fall when you don’t have abilities later!”</p><p>Qiu changkong said coldly as he walked past Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m telling you, you’re just lucky that I got the bye card, so you can run wild for a few more rounds.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph, what a glib tongue.”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in Qiu changkong’s eyes. He walked to the side and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>“Qiu changkong, I hope you can make it to the end. Otherwise, how am I supposed to torture you?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The battle in the center of the fighting ring broke out.</p><p>“Elemental edge sword technique!”</p><p>“The statue of the god of Berserkers gallops!”</p><p>Two loud shouts rang out.</p><p>Xuan Feng’s sword Qi was so terrifying that it seemed to be able to cut the sky.</p><p>The big-eyed fatty was also very powerful. He was like a giant statue of the god of Berserkers, barging in and destroying Xuan Feng’s sword Qi.</p><p>The two of them fought for 50 to 60 moves. In the end, Xuan Feng’s cultivation was higher than the fat man’s. The fat man was only in the early stage of the martial arts Grandmaster ninth realm. He was no match for Xuan Feng and lost.</p><p>Xuan Feng entered the third round.</p><p>The spectators couldn’t help but sigh. The geniuses from the ancient barren city were indeed powerful. They were the top geniuses in the entire Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>The duel continued.</p><p>Soon, it was Qiu changkong’s turn. His opponent was a genius in the middle of the ninth level of martial ancestor realm. His cultivation was higher than Qiu changkong’s.</p><p>But what was even more shocking was that he was still no match for Qiu changkong. Qiu changkong had crushed his opponent with an overwhelming force.</p><p>will, that’s will! Qiu changkong has already comprehended a trace of Thunder will. No wonder he’s so powerful!</p><p>genius, what a genius! As long as his cultivation reaches the peak of martial ancestor ninth realm, he will be a half-step King!</p><p>this time, he’s probably the eastern sky Divine Guard!</p><p>Many of the spectators were experts, and many of them were even half-step Kings.</p><p>Naturally, he saw through the secret.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you see the difference between you and me? Do you feel despair?”</p><p>Qiu changkong walked to the side and another voice entered Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and ignored him.</p><p>“You win!”</p><p>Qiu changkong felt as if he had just punched air, and he was so depressed that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Next, it was burial’s turn.</p><p>His opponent was also a genius in the middle of the ninth level martial ancestor realm. However, he was not zang Sheng’s opponent at all. In just a few moves, he was beaten by zang Sheng until he vomited blood. If he had not admitted defeat in time, he would probably have been knocked unconscious again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
