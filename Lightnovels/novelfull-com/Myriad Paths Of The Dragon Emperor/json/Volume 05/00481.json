I call him old dog because I think highly of him. Today, I’ll kill you first, and then I’ll kill that old dog!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others were stunned when they heard this.</p><p>Although they didn’t know who Xue Chao’s master was, Xue Chao himself was a King tier. From this, they could tell that Xue Chao’s master was definitely extraordinary.</p><p>Moreover, what did Lu Ming say? To kill Xue Chao? Kill a King?</p><p>They felt that their brains were a little overwhelmed.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you want to kill me? you’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Xue Chao leaped up and laughed wildly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and walked towards Xue Chao.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be afraid of you because of me. I’ll let you have a taste of my newly cultivated unique skill, lightning fairy slash!”</p><p>Xue Chao roared. A combat sword flickering with lightning appeared in his hand.</p><p>The aura of a martial King erupted from his body. He became one with his sword and turned into a flash of lightning sword radiance, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others shouted in shock.</p><p>However, it was too late. The sword light was in front of Lu Ming in an instant. It was too fast.</p><p>At this moment, they were in despair. They thought that Lu Ming would most likely die under this sword.</p><p>However, what happened next petrified them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With one hand behind his back, Lu Ming slapped with his other hand.</p><p>Then, Xue Chao’s attacks, sword Qi, lightning, all of them were instantly destroyed.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A resounding slap reverberated throughout the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Xue Chao’s face. Xue Chao was sent flying a few thousand meters and spun a few hundred times in the air before he stopped.</p><p>One side of his face was swollen like a pig’s head. All of his teeth had fallen out, and blood was constantly flowing down.</p><p>However, Xue Chao did not seem to have any reaction to this. He widened his eyes and looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>Qiu changkong, Qiu Wuyang, and the sun Army were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Hua Chi, Yan Quan, and the others from the mystical sword sect were also completely dumbfounded.</p><p>The entire place was silent as everyone stared at the scene in shock.</p><p>Xue Chao was a King tier.</p><p>He was extremely powerful. Five days ago, Xue Chao had destroyed the mystical sword sect’s sect protecting formation with a casual strike of his sword. His strength was so powerful that it made people despair.</p><p>However, such a powerful King had unleashed his full strength to kill Lu Ming, only to be sent flying by Lu Ming’s slap as if he was a chick.</p><p>What was going on? How was this possible?</p><p>Everyone’s brain seemed to have short-circuited, and they couldn’t react for a moment.</p><p>“Martial King, martial King, Lu Ming, you’ve broken through to the martial King realm.”</p><p>After a long while, Xue Chao finally let out a hysterical scream.</p><p>His voice was filled with disbelief.</p><p>It had only been a short while, and Lu Ming had already broken through to the martial King realm. It was hard for him to accept this. After all, he had been stuck at the half-step King realm for many years. He had accumulated for many years before he had broken through by luck.</p><p>However, how long had it been since Lu Ming left?</p><p>monster, monster, he’s a monster!</p><p>Xue Chao felt his heart trembling, exuding endless fear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, Xue Chao’s shrieks had ignited the entire mystical sword sect.</p><p>“What? Why did Lu Ming break through to the martial King realm?”</p><p>martial King, martial King! Hahaha, the mystical sword sect has finally given birth to a martial King.</p><p>“Hey, Lu Ming has left the mystical sword sect long ago!”</p><p>“I don’t care. I’m certain that he’s from the mystical sword sect.”</p><p>such a young martial King. This is unbelievable!</p><p>“We’re saved, we’re saved!”</p><p>Regardless of whether it was the disciples of the mystical sword sect or the disciples of the Crimson Cloud Valley, they were so overjoyed that they almost lost their minds. They only knew how to roar crazily to express the ecstasy and excitement in their hearts.</p><p>Among them, there were even many elders who were of a certain age who were the same.</p><p>As for Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the other higher-ups, they weren’t any better. They were all trembling with excitement.</p><p>martial King! Lu Ming has actually broken through to the martial King realm!</p><p>Lin Xueyi growled, her voice trembling.</p><p>He would not be surprised if Lu Ming could break through to the martial King realm in the future.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had now broken through to the martial King realm. This was simply too shocking.</p><p>How old was Lu Ming? Not even twenty years old, right?</p><p>There had never been a martial King under the age of twenty in the cloud Emperor mountain range.</p><p>“How is that possible? How was that possible? Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Qiu changkong shrieked. He was scared out of his wits. He flew away frantically, trying to get as far away from Lu Ming as possible.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply going to become his nightmare.</p><p>“Leave? Qiu changkong, you have nowhere to go today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze fell on Qiu changkong. Qiu changkong was so scared that he almost peed his pants.</p><p>At this moment-</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the Army of the ten directions Sword School, five auras suddenly burst out.</p><p>Each of these five auras was vast and boundless, and each aura was as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>King’s aura. These five auras were actually all King’s auras.</p><p>Moreover, each of them was much stronger than Xue Chao’s.</p><p>One of them, in particular, was incomparably terrifying. It was vast and mighty, surging out like a vast sea.</p><p>A terrifying pressure covered the entire area, and many of the weaker cultivators fell to the ground.</p><p>Then, five figures stepped into the air and floated in the air.</p><p>There were only five brawny men with extremely burly figures and muscles as solid as steel.</p><p>The person in the middle was actually one-eyed, and the most terrifying aura was emitted by him.</p><p>two of them are at the early stage of the second level of the martial King realm, and two of them are at the middle stage. The middle-aged man has actually reached the early stage of the third level of the martial King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell the other party’s cultivation.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others widened their eyes in fear.</p><p>A King, another King.</p><p>Moreover, five King tiers had appeared at once.</p><p>From their auras, each of them was much stronger than Xue Chao.</p><p>How did this happen? It had been over a thousand years since the blazing sun Empire had produced a King. Even Lin Xueyi and the others, who were half-step Kings, had only seen a few kings in their entire lives.</p><p>But what happened today? Why were there King tiers appearing one after another?</p><p>What was the purpose of these King tiers?</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others had a bad feeling.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you won’t be able to kill anyone today. On the contrary, today is your doomsday!”</p><p>At this time, the one-eyed man in the middle spoke, his voice full of killing intent.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the rest were shocked. Were these Kings here to kill Lu Ming?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was very calm as he asked indifferently.</p><p>“Hehe, you don’t need to know who we are. You only need to know that we are here to kill you. That’s enough!”</p><p>The one-eyed man sneered.</p><p>hehe, do you think I don’t know that it’s because of that old dog, the Thunder Palace Master? that old dog has really put in a lot of effort. In order to kill me, he actually set up a series of traps and mobilized so many Kings, even a Lv 3 martial King!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
