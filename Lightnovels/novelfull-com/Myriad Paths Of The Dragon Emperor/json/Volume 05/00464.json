After cultivating for so long, he also wanted to go out for a walk.</p><p>Lu Ming, given your ability, the mission this time is a two-star Mission. Of course, if you feel that it is too difficult, you can withdraw from the mission. However, once you complete the two-star Mission, the reward will be unusually generous.</p><p>The emissary from the hall of mission said.</p><p>“Emissary, can you let me see what the mission is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>alright, the contents of the mission are in this Jade token. Take a look!</p><p>The emissary from the hall of mission waved his hand and a Jade token appeared. It flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and took the Jade card. With a thought, the contents of the Jade card appeared in his mind.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming nodded and said,”I’ll take on this two-star Mission.” &Nbsp;</p><p>The emissary from the hall of mission smiled and said, ” well, you’re not the only one who’s taking this task. There are several others. Tomorrow morning, you go to the mission reception hall in the myriad Star City and meet them. Let’s set off together.</p><p>With that, the emissary from the hall of mission turned and left.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the courtyard and thought about the contents of the mission.</p><p>The so-called two-star missions were usually completed by the second-rank Empyrean sky divine guards. The second-rank Empyrean sky divine guards were basically martial King realm experts.</p><p>Originally, Lu Ming was a level one Empyrean heavens Divine Guard and should not have taken on two-star missions. However, considering the combat strength he had displayed previously, it was normal for him to take on two-star missions.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also wanted to take on a challenging mission. To Lu Ming, a one-star Mission was not challenging at all. Furthermore, the reward after completion was very low. It was a pure waste of time.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to comprehend the Thunder concept in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>A day passed by quickly. Early the next morning, Lu Ming left the Emperor heaven divine Palace. When he arrived at the myriad Star City, he went directly to the mission reception hall.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked into the mission reception hall, he saw three people gathered together.</p><p>Of the three people, one was a young woman of about 25 or 26 years old. She was quite good-looking, with graceful curves and was very beautiful.</p><p>In addition, there was a skinny man in his fifties, and the last man was a burly man in his thirties.</p><p>All three of them held a task Jade card.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the task Jade card and channeled essential Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The task Jade plates trembled slightly and glowed on their own. At the same time, the task Jade plates in the hands of the three people also trembled slightly and emitted light, resonating with Lu Ming’s Jade plate.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked up to him. He cupped his fists and said,”The three of you, are you also going to the northern Liang mountain to investigate the extermination of the two sects?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The burly man in his thirties stood up and cupped his fists at Lu Ming. He frowned when he sized Lu Ming up.</p><p>“What? The fourth person is you. You’re just a half step King, how could you receive a two star Mission?”</p><p>Suddenly, the woman called out. Her tone was filled with contempt.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly and asked,”what’s wrong?” I’m indeed a half-step King, so I can’t take on two-star missions?”</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. Kid, do you know what a two-star Mission represents? A two-star Mission is a mission that can only be accepted by a martial King. The three of us are all first level martial Kings and second level empyrean heaven divine guards.”</p><p>moreover, a two-star Mission is dangerous even for martial King realm martial artists. You’re just a half-step King realm, and you dare to take a two-star Mission? are you looking for death? ” I really don’t know what the hall of mission is thinking. Why would they assign a piece of trash to do this mission?”</p><p>The young woman looked at Lu Ming contemptuously and said loudly.</p><p>hehe, is the first level of the martial King realm very impressive? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and he sneered.</p><p>Lv 1 martial King realm is nothing, but I can kill you with one move. Kid, I advise you to get lost.</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>“Alright, Huang Jing, stop talking.”</p><p>The burly man shouted at this time.</p><p>The young woman seemed to be quite afraid of the burly man. She snorted coldly and closed her mouth, no longer saying anything.</p><p>The burly man revealed a smile and said,”Little brother, I’m sorry. Huang Jing’s temper is a bit short. Please don’t take offense.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and did not say anything.</p><p>The burly man continued,”but little brother, to be honest, this mission is really not something you can accept. Did the hall of missions make a mistake?” I advise you to go back to the hall of mission and apply for a new mission.”</p><p>“No need. I’ve already confirmed this mission. It’s suitable for me.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Suitable for you? Let me tell you, if you’re not a King, then you’re just an ant. Kid, you can shamelessly follow us, but let me tell you, when we encounter danger, we won’t help you. Don’t even think about dragging us down.”</p><p>The young woman sneered.</p><p>“Hehe, don’t worry. I’m afraid you’ll be a burden to me.”</p><p>Lu Ming was at loggerheads.</p><p>“What’s the use of a sharp tongue?”</p><p>The young woman snorted coldly and walked to the side, not saying anything.</p><p>“Alright, if that’s the case, then let’s set off together. But little brother, if you really do encounter danger, you’d better run away quickly. We really won’t be able to take care of you then.”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s quintessential essence had been converted to 99%. His Thunder mentality was also constantly improving. The strength of his combat strength had increased by another level compared to the battle with Xue Chao more than half a month ago.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that he was not weaker than some of the veteran Kings.</p><p>The burly man laughed bitterly and helplessly. He really did not know where Lu Ming got his confidence from.</p><p>Then, the burly man began to introduce, ” “I’m xu Zhong.”</p><p>Then, he pointed at the skinny man in his fifties who had not spoken a word and said, ” “This is song ke.”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and nodded at song ke.</p><p>“You know the name of the last person. Little brother, how should I address you?”</p><p>Xu Zhong asked.</p><p>“Oh.. ‘m …”</p><p>When Lu Ming was about to introduce himself, he was interrupted by Huang Jing.</p><p>“You don’t need to introduce yourself. You won’t live long anyway.”</p><p>Huanghing coldly, Huang Jing said.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered to introduce them and just stood aside.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Xu Zhong came out to smooth things over.</p><p>Then, the four of them left the mission reception hall, rose into the air, and headed north of the myriad stars city.</p><p>Their mission this time was to head to the northern Liang mountain and investigate the murder of a sect higher-up.</p><p>During this period of time, there were a total of two sects in the northern Liang mountain. The higher-ups of the martial arts Grandmaster and above were innocently slaughtered. The strange thing was that after the incident, their corpses all disappeared.</p><p>Moreover, both sects had a Lv 1 martial King realm expert in charge.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
