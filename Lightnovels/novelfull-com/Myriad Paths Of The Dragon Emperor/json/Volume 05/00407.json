It seems like you’ve lost!</p><p>...</p><p>Bu Feifan laughed.</p><p>it seems that Phoenix lake’s deterrence is only average!</p><p>Sun Chu also sighed.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s face suddenly turned extremely gloomy. Then, he looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>“Kid, I told you to get lost, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>Huang chixuan said sinisterly.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Huang chixuan and smiled faintly, ” “I told you to get lost, are you going to get lost?”</p><p>“Tell me to get lost? Kid, have you gone crazy? do you have the right to do that?”</p><p>Huang chixuan sneered!</p><p>“Then that’s it, you’re telling me to get lost? Who Do You Think You Are, do you have the right to do so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Bu Feifan laughed wildly and said, ” “Huang chixuan, it seems that the deterrence of your Phoenix Lake is really not that great? Or is it that your deterrence is not enough?”</p><p>Bu Feifan’s words made Huang chixuan so angry that he gritted his teeth. However, he had no confidence in dealing with bu Feifan. He could only turn his anger into a sharp killing intent, a killing intent towards Lu Ming.</p><p>kid, even if you kneel down and beg me now, you won’t be able to get lost. You will pay the price for your words and actions. I will make you wish you were dead!</p><p>Huang chixuan said gloomily.</p><p>nonsense, don’t talk nonsense. If you want to fight, hurry up!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and the other geniuses from the other regions were stunned.</p><p>Where did this hothead come from? he actually dared to speak to Huang chixuan like this, this was simply courting death.</p><p>“Good, good, good, very good!”</p><p>Huang chixuan said ‘good’ three times in a row. His voice was extremely gloomy and a terrifying aura rose from his body.</p><p>senior brother Huang, there’s no need for you to deal with this kind of trash personally. I’m more than enough to deal with him!</p><p>At this moment, a youth with triangular eyes walked out from the Phoenix Lake area and called out.</p><p>this guy is taking the opportunity to flatter senior brother Huang again.</p><p>Someone whispered in the Phoenix Lake area.</p><p>When the voice reached the triangular-eyed young man’s ears, he chuckled and didn’t care at all.</p><p>“No need, I’ll do it myself. I’ll make him regret every single word he said.”</p><p>Huang chixuan waved his hand and the triangular-eyed youth retreated.</p><p>The triangular-eyed young man sighed helplessly. It was a pity that he had missed this opportunity.</p><p>“Kid, you have a sharp tongue. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Huang chixuan’s figure moved like lightning. He was so fast that he was in front of Lu Ming in an instant and clawed at him.</p><p>However, he was fast, but Lu Ming was not slow either. The moment Huang chixuan moved, the demon subduing spear appeared in his hand and he stabbed at Huang chixuan’s palm.</p><p>“You want to stop me? Break!”</p><p>Huang chixuan shouted coldly, and his claws burst with sharp claw light, grabbing at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear and the claw collided with each other, producing a violent boom.</p><p>A shocking wave of air swept out, and Lu Ming and Huang chixuan retreated at the same time.</p><p>Each of them retreated a hundred meters and stood in the air.</p><p>“What? That kid can actually block one of Chi chixuan’s moves, it looks like they’re even!”</p><p>“How is that possible? Could it be that this kid can fight Huang chixuan?”</p><p>“Impossible! This kid’s combat strength may be good, but it’s impossible for him to fight Huang chixuan. If I’m not wrong, he didn’t even use much strength just now, but that kid probably used 80 – 90% of his strength.”</p><p>“Yes, that should be the case!”</p><p>The geniuses from the bigger regions were all discussing.</p><p>kid, so you have some strength. No wonder you’re so arrogant. But if you think you can fight me with that, then you’re wrong. I’ll let you know how terrifying my true strength is!</p><p>Huang chixuan said coldly.</p><p>His arms moved slightly and a pair of spirit weapon gloves appeared on his hands. At the same time, a powerful aura rushed out and a fiery red Bird condensed above Huang chixuan’s head.</p><p>The bird’s entire body was fiery red, and there were red flames burning on it. Its tail was especially similar to the tail of the legendary Phoenix.</p><p>The Phoenix-tailed bird was said to be a mutant with the bloodline of a true Phoenix. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>On the Phoenix-tailed bird’s body, there were six silver Meridian cycles that were shining with an extremely bright light.</p><p>King level sixth rank bloodline.</p><p>His bloodline exploded, causing his aura to reach its peak.</p><p>“Flying Phoenix claw!”</p><p>Huang chixuan’s figure moved and his hand claw grabbed out.</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>Like the claws of a real phoenix, they swiped through the air, leaving a trail of cracks in the space, as if it was about to be torn apart.</p><p>This claw also contained a perfect Fire Force, which was several times stronger than the previous one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming also activated his second blood Meridian and thrust his spear forward. The power of wind and Fire merged and gathered, forming a thick spear ray.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the two of them were forced back again.</p><p>This move was evenly matched.</p><p>“How is that possible? Die!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared and his claws continued to claw out, almost tearing the space apart. It was really terrifying. Every claw caused the space to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand, fearlessly clashing with Huang chixuan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The energy swept across the world, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming dodged a claw ray and flew thousands of meters away, grabbing a mountain peak.</p><p>With a loud explosion, the mountain peak exploded, turning into broken stones that flew everywhere. It was a terrifying sight.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear radiance flew out and pierced a deep hole with a diameter of ten meters in the ground.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were shocked and quickly retreated, afraid of being affected.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than ten moves in a row, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Phoenix Wing slash!”</p><p>At this time, Huang chixuan roared and his true Qi boiled. With a shake of his arms, a pair of phoenix wings vaguely condensed on his arms.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Huang chixuan waved his hand and his phoenix wings were like heavenly blades, slashing down at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of the attack was much stronger than the flying Phoenix claw.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Huang chixuan laughed.</p><p>let’s see who dies! Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and a Dragon’s Roar sounded.</p><p>Instantly, the world seemed to have returned to the era of ancient divine beasts fighting for hegemony.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Phoenix Wing slash and the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps collided heavily.</p><p>The space trembled violently like a piece of cloth, and violent energy shot out in all directions.</p><p>The people who were watching the battle retreated frantically.</p><p>There were only three people standing in the air, motionless.</p><p>They were bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and Xuan Feng.</p><p>The three of them released a powerful aura to resist the force.</p><p>After the roar, Lu Ming and Huang chixuan flew back again.</p><p>They were equally matched again.</p><p>It had to be said that Huang chixuan was indeed extremely powerful. With a cultivation of the peak of the martial ancestor eighth realm, he had been through four battles. His battle power was enough to kill an ordinary half-step King.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the eighth level martial arts Grandmaster realm and he could only fight to a draw with him.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that even if he used the heavenly path palm, he might not be able to defeat nie chixuan.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s physical body grew stronger, the power of the first step of the nine Dragons heaven trampling steps was already infinitely close to that of the heavenly way palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
