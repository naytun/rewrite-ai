Could it be in the divine wilderness?</p><p>...</p><p>It was said that beyond the divine wilderness continent, there were other continents. However, that was too far away and was only a legend.</p><p>Also, what did he mean by the only one in the world?</p><p>Lu Ming could not understand.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, don’t worry. Nothing will happen to Qiu Yue. When she’s successful in her cultivation, she might come back to look for you. That girl will miss you.”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was a little unhappy, Lu Yuntian tried to console him.</p><p>“Father, mother, I’m fine.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and composed himself.</p><p>Following that, he began to chat with Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming took his leave.</p><p>Lu Ming strode into the mystical sword sect’s meeting hall.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others were all inside.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming enter, they quickly stood up and saluted him. “Greetings, Lord King!”</p><p>we’re all acquaintances, so there’s no need to be so polite. Hua Chi, I promised you that I would let you personally destroy the ten direction Sword School. Now, the time has come.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and said very directly.</p><p>Hua Chi’s face was filled with ecstasy. He came to Lu Ming and bowed deeply.”Brother Lu, Hua Chi will remember this and be extremely grateful to be able to get his revenge.”</p><p>“Haha, Hua Chi, with our relationship, there’s no need to be so polite. Let’s go. We’ll go to the imperial capital first and help you take back the imperial capital. Then, we’ll kill our way to the ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, and the others said.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” okay, sect leader Lin, Hua Chi and I will leave first. You guys bring the martial ancestor and above experts and follow.</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After all, he still had to leave the aftermath to Lin Xueyi and the others.</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s quintessential essence rolled up and he disappeared with Hua Chi.</p><p>“Gather all the experts above the martial ancestor realm and we can set off!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi ordered.</p><p>Lu Ming brought Hua Chi with him and left the mystical sword sect as fast as lightning, heading for the imperial capital.</p><p>Ten thousand miles away from the mystical sword sect, an Army was charging towards the sect at high speed.</p><p>This Army was Scarlet in color and exuded a terrifying aura. It was Lu Ming’s Crimson scaled Wolf cavalry.</p><p>OWW! OWW!</p><p>Wolf howls rang out as the blood red Cavalry charged forward.</p><p>It could be seen that every soldier was soaked in blood. They had obviously gone through an intense battle.</p><p>hurry, hurry up. Just now, the ten direction sword sect’s Army of 100000 and the sun Army broke through the encirclement and charged towards the mystical sword sect. They used the other troops to hold us back. They must be attacking the mystical sword sect. We must rush back to help.</p><p>Huaying was extremely anxious and kept shouting.</p><p>During this period of time, the blood red iron cavalry had been led by Huaying.</p><p>“General, there are extremely powerful experts in the ten direction Sword School and the sun Army. Even if we rush over, I’m afraid it’ll be of no use.”</p><p>A Deputy general at the side said.</p><p>even if it’s useless, we still have to go. The Marquis champion’s family is in the mystical sword sect, and the eighth prince is above them. Even if we’re completely annihilated, we still have to go and save him.</p><p>Huaying scolded.</p><p>“Yes, general!”</p><p>The Deputy general responded.</p><p>“Eh? What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, a Deputy general looked at the sky in the distance.</p><p>Huaying and the others also looked over.</p><p>At the end of the horizon, there was a bolt of lightning that was rapidly approaching.</p><p>In the next moment, the lightning appeared in the sky above them. The lightning receded, and two young figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>“What’s that? Crown … The Marquis champion?”</p><p>it’s really the Marquis champion. The Marquis champion is back, and the eighth prince is back as well.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry instantly cried out in shock.</p><p>your subordinate greets the Marquis champion and the eighth prince!</p><p>Huaying hurriedly rushed up to the sky and bowed.</p><p>your subordinate greets the Marquis champion and the eighth prince!</p><p>All the blood red iron cavalry saluted Lu Ming and Hua Chi.</p><p>However, the first person they called out to was Lu Ming, followed by the eighth prince.</p><p>Lu Ming had single-handedly created the blood red Cavalry. In their hearts, Lu Ming was the Supreme existence. Their first instinct was to listen to Lu Ming’s orders.</p><p>The blood red Cavalry was Lu Ming’s blood red Cavalry. It was the Marquis champion’s blood red Cavalry.</p><p>Even if Huaying was a member of the royal family, Lu Ming was their top priority now.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>Marquis champion, eighth prince, it’s great that you’re fine. We were just about to head to the mystical sword sect, but we didn’t expect to see you here. Has the mystical sword sect been defeated? ”</p><p>Huaying’s face was solemn.</p><p>He guessed that the mystical sword sect might have been defeated, and Lu Ming had saved Hua Chi and broken out of the siege.</p><p>“Yes, the war with the mystical sword sect has ended.”</p><p>Hua Chi nodded.</p><p>“What? Could it be that the mystical sword sect has been completely annihilated?”</p><p>Huaying’s expression changed.</p><p>If that was really the case, then the situation was really over. With just these people, they wouldn’t be able to cause any waves at all. They could only retreat to the border as soon as possible.</p><p>you’re wrong. The war with the mystic essence sword sect has ended. The ones who were completely annihilated were the ten direction sword sect and the sun Army. Marquis champion and I are heading to the imperial capital now to kill the Heavenly King, that traitor!</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Huaying and the others were dumbfounded. They didn’t expect such an outcome.</p><p>I forgot to tell you that the Marquis champion has already broken through to the king’s realm. How can those clowns from the ten direction Sword School be his match? ”</p><p>Hua Chi said.</p><p>“What? King … A King?”</p><p>All the blood red Cavalry were stunned, their eyes wide as they looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>King, this word seemed to have a magical power, and it stunned all of them.</p><p>After a while, each of their bodies trembled with excitement. They looked at Lu Ming with crazy admiration.</p><p>“Marquis champion, mighty!”</p><p>the Marquis champion is invincible!</p><p>The tens of thousands of blood red Cavalry shouted in excitement.</p><p>Their general, their Commander-in-Chief, had actually broken through to the king’s realm.</p><p>They were extremely excited. They were the Army that Lu Ming had single-handedly built. They would go through thick and thin together. Lu Ming’s glory was their glory.</p><p>They were naturally excited.</p><p>From now on, the blood red Cavalry would not only be famous in the burning sun Empire, but also in the 36 countries of the cloud Emperor.</p><p>“Blood red Cavalry, hear my order!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Your subordinate is here!”</p><p>The tens of thousands of blood red Cavalry roared, feeling their blood boil.</p><p>“The eighth prince and I will go to the imperial capital first. You guys follow us and kill your way to the imperial capital!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered.</p><p>“Yes, we’ll kill our way to the imperial capital!”</p><p>The blood red Cavalry roared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming brought Hua Chi along and continued on his way to the imperial capital.</p><p>In the imperial capital, within the Imperial Palace, singing and dancing could be heard.</p><p>In the Imperial garden of the imperial capital, the Heavenly King Zhen was wearing a dragon robe and sitting on the Dragon Throne. Beside him, there were a few beautiful concubines.</p><p>A little further down, Hua Jie was wearing a dragon robe and sitting there with an arrogant expression.</p><p>The civil and military officials were seated below.</p><p>In the middle of the Imperial garden, many young girls were dancing, and the Heavenly King was beaming with joy as he watched.</p><p>“Congratulations, Your Majesty. The omnipresent sword sect and the sun Legion are currently attacking the mystical sword sect. Soon, the mystical sword sect will be defeated, and the burning sun Empire will be United. Your Majesty will be the ruler of the burning sun Empire.”</p><p>A shifty-eyed Minister started to flatter the Heavenly King.</p><p>“Hahaha! My beloved official is right!”</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen laughed wildly and was extremely proud.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
