It was dark black in color, extremely majestic and incomparably vast.</p><p>...</p><p>It covered an area of a hundred mu and was as tall as the mountain peak. No one knew how many layers it had.</p><p>“The heaven reaching tower! It’s just like its name!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Then, attendant Huang led the group forward.</p><p>They flew past mountain after mountain, Palace after Palace, and in the sky. Occasionally, experts would fly past and look at them curiously.</p><p>Those experts were not old. They looked to be in their late twenties. The older ones were only in their thirties. They were all in the golden age of warriors.</p><p>However, the aura of these young powerhouses was extremely terrifying. Each of them had a monstrous aura and was unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even the worst of them were at the half-step King realm. Some people were hard to predict, but they were definitely stronger than half-step King realm.</p><p>Many of the young geniuses in Lu Ming’s group were peerless geniuses in their respective areas. However, when they sensed the aura of those young experts, their faces turned pale.</p><p>They were far too inferior.</p><p>cough, cough. Don’t be discouraged. Many of those young experts are the previous batch of Ditian divine guards. They’ve cultivated for five years more than you, so they’re naturally very strong. After five years, you won’t necessarily be weaker than them!</p><p>Deacon Huang shouted.</p><p>that’s right. In the future, I’ll definitely be stronger!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Many young men took a deep breath and regained their fighting spirit.</p><p>Deacon Huang nodded in satisfaction. Not long after, they arrived in front of an extremely ancient and majestic palace.</p><p>this is the Dao enlightenment Palace. It’s extremely wondrous. Once you enter, you can observe the changes in the intent realm of heaven and earth. It will greatly help you in comprehending the intent realm of heaven and earth!</p><p>Attendant Huang introduced.</p><p>“What? It can help one comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>that’s right. Not only can it help one comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth, but it can also help martial arts grandmasters and Warriors comprehend force!</p><p>Deacon Huang continued.</p><p>“What? It can even help one comprehend force?”</p><p>The eyes of many young men were already shining.</p><p>of course, the Dao Comprehension Palace can be said to be the sacred land of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, second only to the hundred deities slope. It was established by the great Palace Master of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Attendant Huang said smugly.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi, my God!</p><p>All the young men were amazed.</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi was high and mighty. He was one of the top experts in the divine wilderness continent. He was famous and his name was known throughout the ages. Who did not know him?</p><p>This Dao Comprehension Palace was actually built by Martial Emperor Di Yi. It was exciting to think about it.</p><p>“Martial Emperor Di Yi?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>The Supreme Being of the nine suns had only helped him suppress the bloodline aura of the nine Dragons for ten years. Now, about a year had passed, and there were still nine years left.</p><p>Nine years later, the power of the nine suns Supreme would disappear, and he would have to face Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>This was almost impossible. However, Lu Ming would not give up. He was full of motivation and fighting spirit.</p><p>If other people knew what he was thinking, they would be scared to death.</p><p>hehe, but I have to tell you that if you want to enter the Dao enlightenment Palace to cultivate, it will cost you 100 Supreme spiritual crystals for one day!</p><p>Attendant Huang said with a smile.</p><p>“What? 100 top-grade spiritual crystals a day? Oh my God, this is too expensive!”</p><p>Everyone sucked in a cold breath.</p><p>A Supreme spiritual crystal was equivalent to 100 upper spiritual crystals, 10000 middle spiritual crystals, and 1000000 lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>100 Supreme spiritual crystals were equivalent to 100 million lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>100 million lower spiritual crystals for a day of cultivation. It was as if a bucket of cold water had been poured on them. Their hearts turned cold.</p><p>With their wealth, even if they used all they had, they would not be able to cultivate for a few days.</p><p>Deacon Huang chuckled and did not say anything else. He continued flying forward.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived in front of a huge mountain peak.</p><p>On the mountain peak, ancient trees towered into the sky, spiritual birds flew in the air, and auspicious beasts lightly roared. It was a peaceful scene.</p><p>One could see courtyards among the trees, layer upon layer, spread all over the mountain. No one knew how many there were.</p><p>As soon as they arrived, they felt that the heaven and earth spiritual energy here was much denser than in other places. It was much denser than in the myriad Star City.</p><p>this is where you will live. Each of you will have a courtyard. The number of your courtyards has been marked on your Divine Guard tokens. You can check in with the correct number!</p><p>Attendant Huang instructed.</p><p>“Many thanks, Deacon Huang!” Everyone nodded.</p><p>“Mm! There are other wondrous places in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, but I won’t bring you around one by one. In the future, you can slowly explore them on your own!”</p><p>With that, Deacon Huang flew in front of Lu Ming and smiled. little brother Lu, you are the eastern sky Divine Guard. Your courtyard is not in this area, but on the peak of the mountain. There are four spiritual Springs there, and four courtyards have been built at the source of the spiritual Springs for the four divine guards to live in!</p><p>heavens, the courtyard is actually built on top of the spiritual spring. This treatment is too good!</p><p>Someone exclaimed in admiration. Countless envious eyes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>The eye of the spiritual spring was a place where spiritual energy erupted. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was unimaginably rich.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with envy and jealousy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He did not expect the eastern sky divine guards to be treated so well. No wonder everyone wanted to take this position.</p><p>Being at the eye of the spiritual spring would be very beneficial to Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I’ll bring you up!”</p><p>Attendant Huang said with a smile.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble Deacon Huang!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and Deacon Huang flew towards the peak of the mountain.</p><p>Leaving behind a group of envious people.</p><p>“Sigh, it’s really infuriating to compare people. Not only Can Lu Ming live at the eye of the spiritual spring, but he also has a spot to enter the hundred deities slope. Even Deacon Huang has to curry favor with him.”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>this can’t be helped. Who asked others to be more talented? there’s no way to compare. Let’s go find our own courtyard!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>One by one, the young men flew down the mountain and walked toward the courtyards.</p><p>Each courtyard was marked with a number, and everyone could check in according to the number.</p><p>Lu Ming and attendant Huang arrived at the peak of the mountain.</p><p>Standing in the air, one could see a courtyard in each of the four directions of the mountain peak. The clouds and mist were everywhere, making it look like a Fairyland.</p><p>This was the courtyard where the four divine guards lived.</p><p>Due to the size of the mountain peak, the four courtyards were separated by at least several li.</p><p>“The one on the east side is your courtyard!”</p><p>Attendant Huang pointed to the courtyard on the east side and introduced.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>brother Lu, after several months of fighting, you must be tired. Go and rest. I won’t disturb you any longer. If you need anything in the future, feel free to find me. Oh, and the courtyard of the four divine guards is surrounded by inscription formations. You need to use your Divine Guard token to open it. This is to prevent others from disturbing you when you cultivate!</p><p>Deacon Huang said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you, Deacon Huang!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed.</p><p>He naturally wouldn’t reject the goodwill of others.</p><p>Deacon Huang revealed a smile on his face. Then, he turned into a ray of light and disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
