You’re just a piece of trash, yet you’re still so arrogant. You’re really looking for death!</p><p>Zang Sheng sneered. He then kicked Yu changfei’s head. Yu changfei’s body flew out like a broken sack and fell off the fighting ring.</p><p>After falling off the fighting ring, he fainted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the stands, an old man stood up and roared, ” “Zang Sheng, your methods are too vicious. Yu changfei has clearly lost, yet you still used such a heavy blow. You’ve violated the rules.”</p><p>This old man was the elder leading the team in the Jade virtual plain.</p><p>“Old man, what are you shouting for? I didn’t kill him, so how is that against the rules?”</p><p>Zang Sheng sneered.</p><p>“You f * ck!”</p><p>The elder leading the team of Yuxu plain turned red and looked at the middle-aged protector. “Protector, is this against the rules?”</p><p>“Not dead, doesn’t count!”</p><p>The middle-aged protector’s answer was very simple, which made the elder leading the team of the Yuxu plain stunned.</p><p>Then, he sat down with an ashen face.</p><p>Zang Sheng’s smile became even more smug.</p><p>this zang Sheng is indeed terrifying. As expected of the genius who was the first to break through the barrier!</p><p>his cultivation has definitely reached the ninth level of the martial ancestor realm. And it’s not as simple as the early or middle stage of the ninth level. He didn’t even use his full strength just now!</p><p>Everyone was discussing.</p><p>At the edge of the fighting ring, the other geniuses and experts were also looking at zang Sheng with a grave expression.</p><p>Burial’s combat strength gave them a lot of pressure.</p><p>this burial has improved so much during this period of time. It must be related to the blood of bu Feifan and the other geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>When he was in the dragon’s cave, zang Sheng’s strength should be similar to Huang chixuan, bu Feifan and the others. He should also be similar to Yu changfei. But now, he was much stronger than before.</p><p>No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>zang Sheng from the Dragon burial abyss is the winner of this battle. Let the next battle begin!</p><p>The middle-aged protector announced.</p><p>Zang Sheng walked to the side of the fighting ring. Two figures flashed and appeared in the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>This time, it was still two geniuses from the Super regions, a man and a woman. However, their cultivation was much stronger than Yu changfei’s.</p><p>This was because both of their cultivations had broken through to the early stage of the ninth realm of martial ancestor realm. Furthermore, they were both battle hardened and extremely powerful.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle. All kinds of ultimate moves and killing moves dazzled some people.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than 200 moves before the woman won by luck.</p><p>Then, the third Battle began.</p><p>For this battle, Qiu changkong went up, and his opponent was tie kuangzhong from the iron Peak.</p><p>Tie kuangzhong’s body was more than two meters tall, and his muscles were as hard as steel. He was full of strength and seemed to be invincible.</p><p>“Kid, you’re from the cloud Emperor mountain range? Hehe, it’s not bad to be able to come this far from that small place. However, it’s all over.”</p><p>Tie kuangzhong said in disdain.</p><p>“You’re still far from enough!”</p><p>Qiu changkong was extremely confident.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’ll beat you into a pig head!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tie kuangzhong took a step forward like a wild beast, causing the fighting ring to rumble.</p><p>The muscles on his body swelled up, and a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>Early stage of martial ancestor realm level 9.</p><p>This was tie kuangzhong’s cultivation.</p><p>“Iron Fist!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tie kuangzhong roared as he threw a punch at Qiu changkong.</p><p>“Thunder sword, slash!”</p><p>Qiu changkong shouted. In the next instant, Crimson-red lightning flashed around his body.</p><p>The Scarlet lightning burst out with his combat sword, forming a Scarlet lightning sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Scarlet Thunder sword and tie kuangzhong’s fist collided.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Tie kuangzhong’s body trembled, and his face suddenly changed. He took nine steps back in a row, and every step he took caused the fighting ring to rumble.</p><p>Tie kuangzhong was at a disadvantage in one move.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>He didn’t expect Qiu changkong to be so powerful.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Tie kuangzhong roared in anger. The next moment, a huge crocodile appeared above his head.</p><p>The crocodile was over 20 meters long and covered in armor.</p><p>This was the iron armored demon crocodile, a powerful fierce beast that could fight with the flood Dragon.</p><p>There were six silver chakras around the iron-armored demon crocodile.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The iron armored demon crocodile roared and rushed into tie kuangzhong’s body.</p><p>Suddenly, tie kuangzhong’s already burly body expanded again, and his aura became even more powerful.</p><p>“Bloodline? Do you think you’re the only one who has that?”</p><p>Qiu changkong sneered. In the next moment, a red ball of lightning appeared above his head.</p><p>Zzzzzzzz</p><p>The Crimson ball of lightning sizzled and surrounded by lightning, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>“This is the Scarlet Flame Mystic Thunder!”</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise as he recognized the lightning.</p><p>There was no doubt that this was a special bloodline, and a natural type of special bloodline at that.</p><p>The same type of bloodline could actually be divided into many types.</p><p>For example, the fire bloodline, the ice bloodline, and the lightning bloodline. Each of these bloodlines had many smaller types.</p><p>There were strong and weak.</p><p>As for the Scarlet Flame Mystic lightning, it was considered strong even among the lightning bloodlines.</p><p>Around the lightning bloodline, six silver chakras were shining.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This was the first time he had seen Qiu changkong’s bloodline.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s second bloodline was also a sixth level King. No wonder the other geniuses in the blazing sun Empire couldn’t compare to him.</p><p>Qiu changkong activated his bloodline power, and his aura grew even stronger. His entire body was covered in the power of lightning.</p><p>“Lightning sword, world annihilation!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A Thunderbolt sword instantly pierced through the void and slashed towards tie kuangzhong.</p><p>Tie kuangzhong bellowed in anger. His entire body swelled up like a giant of steel as he lunged towards Qiu changkong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another earth-shattering boom rang out. Tie kuangzhong let out a blood-curdling screech as his huge body was sent flying far away before crashing onto the ground.</p><p>His steel-like body was covered in lightning and blood.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>Tie kuangzhong had been defeated. In front of Qiu changkong, he had no way to fight back.</p><p>Countless people were shocked. How could this young man from the cloud Emperor mountain range be so terrifying?</p><p>On the grandstand, Lu Xiu was so excited that his entire body was trembling.</p><p>The two geniuses from the Cloud King Mountain range had entered the second round. This was unbelievable.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had entered the second round by luck, it was still the second round, right?</p><p>At the edge of the fighting ring, zang Sheng’s eyes flickered with killing intent as he looked at Qiu changkong with a grave expression.</p><p>what a powerful force. No, I don’t think it can be called ‘force’ anymore. It contains a trace of ‘intent’. What kind of fortuitous encounter did Qiu changkong encounter during this period of time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Qiu changkong’s cultivation was only at the early 9th level of martial ancestor realm, but his force was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that there was already a trace of intent within the momentum. This was something that only half-step Kings could master.</p><p>“Interesting, very interesting.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his fighting spirit growing stronger.</p><p>“Cloud Emperor mountain range, Qiu changkong wins!”</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>Qiu changkong sheathed his sword and walked to the side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
