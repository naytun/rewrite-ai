Buzzzzzz!</p><p>...</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming, Huang chixuan, Xuan Feng, bu Feifan, and sun Chu stood in the void, confronting each other and stopping for a while.</p><p>The others were still fighting.</p><p>Huang chixuan, you’re getting bolder, aren’t you? do you want to get beaten up again? ”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Huang chixuan unhappily.</p><p>“Kid, don’t be so arrogant!”</p><p>Huang chixuan said coldly.</p><p>He condensed his genuine Qi to replace his teeth to avoid the awkwardness of a slip in his speech.</p><p>At the side, bu Feifan and sun Chu looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>Huang chixuan’s miserable state, of course they had discovered it.</p><p>Could it be that he was beaten by Lu Ming?</p><p>If that was the case, they had to re-examine Lu Ming.</p><p>“Everyone, this brat is very insidious. He has a kind of hidden weapon that is impossible to guard against. I was ambushed by his hidden weapon. I suggest that we work together to kill this brat first, then we can fight for the Dragon scale.”</p><p>Huang chixuan said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, really?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly patted dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It flew out and smashed towards Huang chixuan.</p><p>“What are you f * cking for!”</p><p>Huang chixuan roared, he was so angry that he was bleeding internally.</p><p>Lu Ming did not play his cards according to common sense. He could not win the argument and immediately took action. What kind of thing was this?</p><p>Huang chixuan burst out with all his strength and desperately resisted.</p><p>But-</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was still smashed in the face by dandan.</p><p>His face, which had been slightly better, had turned into dog shit again.</p><p>“Argh! Ah, f * ck!”</p><p>Huang chixuan shouted like he had gone crazy, almost losing his mind.</p><p>Having his face smashed so many times, Huang chixuan felt like he was going crazy.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss</p><p>Bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and the others all gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming’s stone egg was too strange. It appeared and disappeared unpredictably and could ignore all kinds of energy attacks. It was impossible to guard against it.</p><p>When they looked at Lu Ming, their gazes were extremely solemn.</p><p>everyone, now that Huang chixuan is injured, his combat power has been greatly reduced. Why don’t we join forces and kill Huang chixuan first? that way, we will have one less competitor!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Sun Chu, bu Feifan and the others couldn’t help but look at Huang chixuan.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. The situation would be clearer if they killed one person first.</p><p>As for killing Lu Ming, although they wanted to do so, they did not have the guts to do so. If they were hit by Lu Ming’s stone egg, it would not be good.</p><p>Being stared at by a few people, Huang chixuan felt a chill run down his spine. He screamed and retreated a hundred meters, looking at bu Feifan, Lu Ming, and the others cautiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were extremely unfriendly. He really wanted to find an opportunity to get rid of Huang chixuan.</p><p>“Argh! What the hell is this?”</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>At this moment, someone among the people who were fighting suddenly cried out in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were shocked and could not help but look over.</p><p>Wisps of bloody Qi rose from the surroundings of the underground cave. The bloody Qi rose and the smell of blood assailed their nostrils.</p><p>On the ground, strange patterns had appeared out of nowhere. Shockingly, blood-red tentacles stretched out from the ground and wrapped around some of the experts.</p><p>The experts struggled with all their might, but they were unable to break free. They were tightly bound by the blood-red tentacles.</p><p>“Argh! Ah, my blood!”</p><p>The people who were entangled screamed in horror because their blood was being sucked away by the tentacles.</p><p>In just a dozen breaths, a dozen people had been sucked dry and died an unnatural death.</p><p>Everyone felt a chill run down their spine, and their teeth chattered.</p><p>They thought of the large number of corpses they had seen outside before they entered the dragon’s cave.</p><p>Those corpses had also been sucked dry of their blood, just like the situation in front of them.</p><p>How did this happen? What was it?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The patterns on the ground glowed, and the number of tentacles grew.</p><p>More people were entangled.</p><p>run, run! This is devil earth!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Many people screamed in fear and turned to run.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll also leave this place!”</p><p>Bu Feifan, Sun Chu, and the others gritted their teeth and gave the order to retreat.</p><p>Although the Dragon scale was precious, one needed to be alive to use it. This place was too strange. If he were to leave it here and lose his life, it would not be worth it.</p><p>“Today, none of you will be able to leave!”</p><p>At this moment, an eerie voice sounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the walls of the underground cave, figures suddenly appeared.</p><p>These figures were dressed in black robes and had been hiding in the pits on the walls. No one had noticed them.</p><p>There were about a hundred of them. As soon as they appeared, they shot out beams of light from their hands into the ground. The patterns on the ground glowed brightly.</p><p>&Nbsp; then, more blood-colored tentacles emerged from the ground, blocking everyone’s path of retreat.</p><p>There were at least a few thousand tentacles that were waving wildly, trying to wrap around the group.</p><p>This time, 50 to 60 people were wrapped up by the tentacles. They screamed in fear as their blood was sucked dry.</p><p>After their blood was sucked dry, even more tentacles came out of the ground.</p><p>“This is an inscription formation, Who are you?”</p><p>Bu Feifan swung his saber, and a burning Saber Light cut off five or six tentacles.</p><p>However, the tentacles that were cut off quickly grew back.</p><p>how can you break the Grand burial array that we’ve worked so hard to set up? ”</p><p>The cold voice rang out again. From the direction of the darkness, a young man in a blood-red robe walked out.</p><p>A lifelike Blood Dragon was embroidered on the blood robe.</p><p>The young man’s face was extremely pale, and he looked extremely sinister.</p><p>“Speak, Who are you?”</p><p>Bu Feifan shouted.</p><p>hehe, since you’re going to die Here today, there’s no harm in telling you. We’re from the Dragon burial abyss!</p><p>The blood-robed youth smiled.</p><p>“What? Are you guys from the Dragon burial abyss?”</p><p>Bu Feifan and the others exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>It wasn’t that the other party was very strong. On the contrary, the Dragon burial abyss had always been very mysterious, just like the ancient barren city. However, from time to time, a peerless expert would walk out of the ancient barren city.</p><p>However, the Dragon burial abyss was different. There were very few experts who came out from it. In the past, there had never been any geniuses from the Dragon burial abyss who participated in the selection of the Empyrean heavens divine guards. Therefore, no one understood the true strength of the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>It was just roughly classified as a large area.</p><p>This time, not only did the people from the Dragon burial abyss appear, they had even set up a huge formation to kill them. It was no wonder that they were so shocked.</p><p>“Impossible? How did you guys get in?”</p><p>Sun Chu shouted.</p><p>When they entered, they clearly did not see anyone from the Dragon burial abyss.</p><p>Furthermore, from what the blood-robed youth said, they seemed to have set up the formation a long time ago.</p><p>hehe, how naïve. Do you think there’s only one entrance to the Dragon’s Den? ”</p><p>The blood-robed youth sneered.</p><p>let me tell you, the reason why the Dragon’s Den appeared was also because of us. We deciphered the inscriptions of the Dragon’s Den in order to attract geniuses like you.</p><p>as long as I kill you and absorb your blood, my Dragon’s devouring divine technique will be completed. I’ll definitely become one of the four heavens divine guards in this time’s Ditian Divine Guard selection and lead the Dragon burial abyss to the peak. Hahaha!</p><p>The blood-robed youth laughed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
