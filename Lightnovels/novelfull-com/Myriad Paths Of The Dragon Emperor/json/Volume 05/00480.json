Their goal was to wait for Lu Ming’s arrival.</p><p>...</p><p>Furthermore, Xue Chao and Qiu changkong both hated and feared Lu Ming. They would not be at ease until they confirmed that Lu Ming was dead.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sun Army and the ten direction sword sect Army spread out and surrounded the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Xue Chao waved his hand, and a Jade table and a few Jade chairs immediately appeared.</p><p>The tables and chairs were all floating in the air. Xue Chao was casually sitting on a chair.</p><p>Qiu changkong immediately took out a pot of fine wine and poured a cup for Xue Chao. He also poured a cup for himself and accompanied Xue Chao to drink while waiting.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others had ugly expressions.</p><p>the other party is using psychological warfare to force those with weak minds to surrender. This is an insult to us!</p><p>Hua Chi said with a deep voice.</p><p>The other party had a martial King and could easily crush them. However, they did not make a move. In their eyes, this was an insult to them.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi let out a long sigh. Even if she knew, what could she do?</p><p>His strength, his strength was inferior to others!</p><p>“Hold your position and wait for the situation to change!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi ordered.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in front of the mountain Gate, staring at Qiu changkong and the others.</p><p>After which, Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the other higher-ups also sat cross-legged at the mountain Gate.</p><p>“Remember, if you want to live, surrender now. When I change my mind, it will be too late!”</p><p>Xue Chao’s cold voice spread throughout the mystical sword sect as he drank.</p><p>Countless people in the mystical sword sect had different expressions on their faces.</p><p>Some people were filled with righteous indignation and did not fear death.</p><p>Some people’s eyes flickered and wavered.</p><p>Time slowly passed, and the atmosphere in the mystical sword sect became more and more oppressive.</p><p>“I surrender, I choose to surrender!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone ran out from the foot of the mountain and shouted.</p><p>A burly middle-aged man ran out frantically.</p><p>it’s a Deacon from The White Tiger Hall. Damn it, after hanging out with the Duanmu family for so long, they’ve all become traitors!</p><p>A gold-robed elder roared.</p><p>hahaha, good, I won’t kill him if he surrenders. Sect leader Qiu, make the necessary arrangements. He will be a member of your Shifang sword sect from now on!</p><p>Xue Chao laughed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang quickly nodded in agreement.</p><p>“I also surrender!”</p><p>“I also want to surrender!”</p><p>At this moment, more people started to shout and ran outside. There were more than ten people.</p><p>traitor! You damn traitor!</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>The crowd could tell that these people were originally from The White Tiger Hall.</p><p>“It’s good that these people have left!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>Then, everyone fell silent.</p><p>However, the atmosphere in the mystical sword sect became even more depressing.</p><p>The first day passed just like that. Other than the dozen or so people from The White Tiger Hall who had surrendered, no one else did.</p><p>On the second day, the People’s hearts were even more unstable.</p><p>Some people were getting more and more anxious. This was like waiting for death. Who could bear it?</p><p>Although Lin Xueyi and the rest knew about it, they had no choice.</p><p>The third day!</p><p>“I surrender!”</p><p>“I want to surrender!”</p><p>On the third day, someone finally rushed out of the mystical sword sect with a loud cry.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t limited to The White Tiger Hall. Even people from the other halls began to rush out of the mystical sword sect.</p><p>There were bronze disciples, silver disciples, and even elders.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi sighed, as if she had aged a lot in an instant.</p><p>Time flew by, and it was the fourth day.</p><p>On the fourth day, the number of people who surrendered suddenly exploded, and the number increased greatly.</p><p>“I surrender!”</p><p>…</p><p>The people who surrendered joined together.</p><p>There were thousands of them.</p><p>There were people from the mystical sword sect, the Crimson Cloud Valley, and the imperial family.</p><p>“Damn it, traitor, damn traitor!”</p><p>Ling potian flew into a rage and wished he could rush out and kill those who surrendered.</p><p>However, the number of people who surrendered was still increasing.</p><p>On the fourth day, nearly four thousand people surrendered.</p><p>On the fifth day, the number of people who surrendered decreased, but there were still about 1000 people.</p><p>On the sixth day, Xue Chao suddenly slammed the table heavily.</p><p>it’s been more than five days. Lu Ming is still not here. In my opinion, Lu Ming is already dead!</p><p>Xue Chao said.</p><p>“Senior brother, why don’t we wait for a few more days? what if Lu Ming is still alive?”</p><p>Qiu changkong replied.</p><p>He was fearful of Lu Ming from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“Junior Brother, what are you afraid of? Let’s take them all down first, then we can wait!”</p><p>Xue Chao said.</p><p>“Then, alright, we’ll do as senior brother says!”</p><p>Qiu changkong nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xue Chao stood up and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lin Xueyi suddenly stood up, and a powerful aura burst out from her body, ” “Who’s going to fight the enemy with me?”</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>Ling potian roared.</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>“And me!”</p><p>Shangguan Ming, Yan Quan, the other two half step King Warriors from the mystical sword sect and the Crimson Cloud Valley, as well as some gold robed elders, all responded. Their auras exploded and gathered together, stirring up a storm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a low roar, a tall figure appeared beside Lin Xueyi and the others. It was the Golden-eyed blood corpse.</p><p>haha, a few mere half step King Warriors, and some ants who aren’t even half step King Warriors, and you want to fight with me? you really don’t know your place, you’re simply courting death!</p><p>Xue Chao sneered.</p><p>you’re just a dog. How dare you attack the mystical sword sect? you’re overestimating yourself. You’re courting death!</p><p>As soon as Xue Chao’s voice fell, another cold voice sounded.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Xue Chao and Qiu changkong’s bodies trembled violently as they exclaimed, ” “Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Hua Chi, and the others also shuddered and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!</p><p>Everyone could not help but look towards the source of the voice.</p><p>In the distant sky, a bolt of lightning flashed and flew over.</p><p>It was too fast. It was simply too fast.</p><p>A moment ago, he was at least a few dozen miles away, but in the next moment, he was already right in front of them.</p><p>With a flash of lightning, a handsome figure appeared in the sky. Who else could it be but Lu Ming?</p><p>“Good, we made it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across and he immediately felt at ease.</p><p>For the past five days, he didn’t sleep or rest. He rushed like crazy and finally arrived.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why did you come here alone? the other party has a King. Leave quickly and report this matter to the higher-ups of the Emperor heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi quickly called out.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, you should leave quickly. As the Empyrean heaven divine guards, they actually abused their power and mobilized the blood Zhao Empire’s Army. This is against the rules of the Empyrean heaven Palace. As long as you report this to the higher-ups, I don’t think they will dare to do anything to us.”</p><p>Hua Chi also cried out.</p><p>The other party had a King. Lu Ming was no match for him. It was better to leave first and report the situation to the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming was a member of the eastern sky Divine Guard, and his status was not something they could compare to. As long as he reported the situation, the higher-ups of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would definitely take it seriously.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand slightly and Lin Xueyi and the rest quieted down.</p><p>Imperceptibly, Lu Ming had already gained great prestige in the hearts of Lin Xueyi and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming then turned to Qiu changkong and Xue Chao and said coldly, you two trash! I don’t think you’re that bold. It must be the old dog behind you who ordered you to come!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
