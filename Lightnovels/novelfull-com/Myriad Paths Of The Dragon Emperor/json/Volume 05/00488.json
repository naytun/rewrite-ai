At the same time, a surge of essential core flowed into Hua Chi’s body. Hua Chi felt his body fill with energy.</p><p>“Old man, go to hell!”</p><p>Hua Chi shouted and charged at Heavenly King Zhen.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Seeing that there was no way out, Heavenly King Zhen revealed a fierce look in his eyes. With a wave of his hand, a broad combat sword appeared in his hand and he slashed at Hua Chi.</p><p>The heavenly suppression King’s cultivation was not weak. He had reached the 7th level of the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>Hua Chi was only a ninth grade great Martial Master and had yet to break through to the martial ancestor realm.</p><p>However, Hua Chi’s sword contained Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>Essential core was many times more powerful than essential Qi. Moreover, it was Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Hua Chi’s sword had destroyed all of Heavenly King Zhen’s attacks and split him and his sword in half.</p><p>Heavenly King Zhen, dead!</p><p>“Hahaha, father, father, did you see that? Your son has finally avenged you!”</p><p>Hua Chi knelt on the ground and laughed loudly. As he laughed, tears continued to flow.</p><p>It was as if he wanted to release all the hatred that had been pent up in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He just watched quietly at the side.</p><p>“Hua Jie, don’t leave!”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud roar.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and revealed a smile.</p><p>It turned out that Hua Jie had wanted to take the opportunity to escape, but he had been captured by some ministers.</p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly King had already died, and the officials had no loyalty left. They wanted to take out their hearts and express their feelings to Hua Chi, so how could they let Hua Jie escape?</p><p>“No, let me go, let me go!”</p><p>Hua Jie shouted in fear.</p><p>“Hua Jie, I’ll send you to your father!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s sword was dripping with blood as he walked toward Hua Jie.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, don’t!”</p><p>Hua Jie shrieked. Then, a foul smell came out.</p><p>This guy actually peed his pants again.</p><p>A hint of killing intent appeared in Hua Chi’s eyes. The sword in his hand flashed, and Hua Jie’s cry came to an abrupt end.</p><p>“Eighth prince, I welcome you back to the palace!”</p><p>“Your humble servant respectfully welcomes the eighth prince back to the palace!”</p><p>All of the officials knelt down.</p><p>Hua Chi’s eyes were like lightning as he looked around.</p><p>Everyone kept quiet out of fear, not even daring to breathe loudly.</p><p>They were afraid that Hua Chi would kill them.</p><p>The atmosphere at the scene seemed to freeze.</p><p>“All of you, gather the troops and take control of all of the Heavenly King’s accomplices, troops, and families!” Hua Chi said after a long while.</p><p>Hua Chi did not kill these people. Although they were detestable, they were the only ones who could keep the blazing sun Empire running.</p><p>If he killed them all, who would help him?</p><p>“Yes, yes, this lowly subject will immediately do so!”</p><p>“Eighth prince, leave this matter to this lowly official!”</p><p>The civil and military officials all rushed to agree and then left in a hurry.</p><p>What a joke. This was a good opportunity to express his feelings to Hua Chi. Who would miss it?</p><p>Soon, some of the ministers with heavy military forces retreated.</p><p>The rest of the people were powerless civil officials who looked at Hua Chi and Lu Ming helplessly.</p><p>“Marquis champion, please!”</p><p>Hua Chi waved his hand and said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sat at a random table.</p><p>As for Hua Chi, he sat on the seat where the Heavenly King had been. The other women knelt by the side, trembling.</p><p>The Civil officials also knelt on the ground and waited.</p><p>Time passed, and the imperial capital was in chaos.</p><p>Countless soldiers and horses galloped forward, surrounding and annihilating the underlings of Heavenly King Zhen. There were battles everywhere.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Not long after, Lin Xueyi and the others arrived and appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Sect leader Lin, send some people to help us kill the heaven suppression King!”</p><p>Lu Ming told Lin Xueyi.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi nodded, and then hundreds of martial grandmasters scattered around the imperial capital to help eliminate the heaven suppression King.</p><p>With the addition of these experts, the remnants of the Heavenly King and those who were loyal to him were quickly killed.</p><p>The entire imperial capital was filled with a massacre.</p><p>Many ordinary people knew that the world had changed again. From now on, the Imperial City was going to have a new ruler.</p><p>When many people knew that it was the eighth prince who had returned, they were all very happy.</p><p>The period of time when they were under the Heavenly King’s rule had not been easy.</p><p>A day later, the battle in the imperial capital had ended.</p><p>The imperial capital had completely fallen into Hua Chi’s hands.</p><p>Two days later, the blood red iron cavalry arrived to help Hua Chi take complete control of the imperial capital.</p><p>He would leave the rest to Hua Chi. Lu Ming could not be bothered.</p><p>“Sect leader Lin, it’s time to go to the ten direction sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Lin Xueyi in a courtyard.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi’s eyes were filled with madness and anticipation. He had been waiting for this day for too long.</p><p>An hour later, nearly a hundred people, led by Lu Ming, flew towards the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>The ten direction sword sect was not far from the imperial capital. It was about 10000 miles away. They arrived in about an hour.</p><p>More than 100 people were floating above the ten square Mountain.</p><p>“Activate the sect-protecting formation, quickly activate the sect-protecting formation!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the others arrived, a loud roar was heard from the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>Buzz buzz buzz</p><p>Light filled the entire school. Inscriptions flickered, forming a sect-protecting formation that enveloped the school.</p><p>Countless sword Qi were moving around.</p><p>This sect-protecting formation was similar to the mystical sword sect’s sect-protecting formation, but it was more powerful and mysterious.</p><p>It was obvious that the Shi Fang Sword School had already received the news.</p><p>“It seems that there are still many experts left in the ten direction Sword School!”</p><p>“There’s even a half-step King amongst them!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others said.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>They could only rely on Lu Ming to break the sect-protecting formation of the omnidirectional sword sect.</p><p>If they were to go, they wouldn’t be able to break it in a short time.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s claw clenched in the air and a long spear was formed. Then, the long spear lashed out at the omnipresent sword sect.</p><p>At the same time, the long spear rapidly grew to the size of a mountain and shot toward the ten direction Sword School.</p><p>“Block it, block it!”</p><p>Roars of shock and anger came from the ten direction sword sect.</p><p>At the same time, the sect-protecting formation of the omnidirectional sword sect flickered madly. Several huge sword Qi soared into the sky and blasted toward Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>However, as the spear radiance pressed down, the sword Qi was crushed like tofu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance heavily struck the sect-protecting formation of the ten directions sword sect.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Immediately, all the foundations of the sect-protecting formation in the Shifang sword sect exploded.</p><p>Screams rang out as the people controlling the formation were killed by the backlash.</p><p>With one move, the sect-protecting formation of the ten directions sword sect was broken!</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming’s combat strength was shocking and that he was a peerless King, Lin Xueyi and the rest were still shocked to see this scene with their own eyes.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” sect leader Lin, I will leave the rest to you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming had lost all interest in the following battles.</p><p>“Alright, don’t worry!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi nodded.</p><p>They immediately charged in.</p><p>This was a one-sided massacre.</p><p>90% of the ten directions sword sect’s experts had already died in the mystical sword sect. How could the remaining ones be a match for Lin Xueyi and the others?</p><p>Blood Qi filled the Shifang mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
