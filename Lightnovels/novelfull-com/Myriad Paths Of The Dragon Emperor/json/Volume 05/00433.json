However, in the huge myriad Star City, they did not cause any waves.</p><p>...</p><p>The myriad stars city was too huge, and there were too many experts. Countless people flew in the sky every day, and they were used to it.</p><p>Because there were many people in the sky, there was a limit to the speed of flying in the sky of the myriad Star City. If the speed was not limited, it would be impossible to control the speed of ten miles in an instant, and a large number of Warriors would bump into each other.</p><p>At that time, he would not die in battle, but would crash into other martial artists. That would be embarrassing.</p><p>Half an hour later, Deacon Huang led the group to a huge building.</p><p>This building was a Pavilion, seven stories high, and it was extraordinarily majestic.</p><p>In front of the pavilion, there was a stone tablet with a row of words written on it: The Emperor heaven divine Palace, the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>“This is the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s eastern branch Palace in the Tianxuan region? It can’t be, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were full of doubts.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>Although this Pavilion was huge, it couldn’t hold too many people. If it was said to be the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s branch Palace in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region, wouldn’t it be a little too shabby?</p><p>“Haha, little guys, watch carefully!”</p><p>Deacon Huang seemed to have seen through everyone’s thoughts. He laughed and took out a purple-gold token. He infused his true Qi into it, and the purple-gold token shone with rays of light.</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of ripples appeared in front of the pavilion. Slowly, a huge Whirlpool appeared.</p><p>A spatial path. This place was actually a spatial path.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Deacon Huang smiled and stepped into the vortex. The others looked at each other and followed.</p><p>“Could there be another heavenly passage?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and stepped in.</p><p>The world suddenly turned. The next moment, Lu Ming found himself in a huge square.</p><p>The square was at least ten miles in length and width. The ground was actually paved with white jade. On the White jade, there were inscriptions that glowed.</p><p>More than 3000 people appeared in the square.</p><p>In the square, there was a shocking discussion.</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked forward.</p><p>In front of him was a vast mountain range. Some of the mountains had peaks that reached into the clouds. It was extremely majestic.</p><p>One could see that there were many huge buildings built between the vast mountains.</p><p>There were palaces and towers, all of which were incomparably majestic, even taller than mountains.</p><p>Between the mountains and the palace towers, one could see spiritual birds flying and strange beasts roaring, which resounded through the world.</p><p>At the same time, he could see the figures of martial artists shuttling back and forth between the mountains and palaces.</p><p>It was like a Fairyland.</p><p>“Is this the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s branch Palace in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region? It’s actually in a plane, and the heaven and earth spiritual energy is so rich, five or six times that of the myriad Star City.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he pondered in his heart.</p><p>No wonder there was only one tower outside the thousand stars city.</p><p>alright, everyone. This is the real branch Palace of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Although it’s only a small plane, it’s considered quite large in a small plane. It’s tens of millions of miles wide and has abundant resources!</p><p>Attendant Huang introduced with a smug expression.</p><p>“Thousands of miles? It’s huge!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly speechless.</p><p>In fact, along the way, Lu Ming had come into contact with quite a number of small planes.</p><p>Mid-level planes were very rare.</p><p>This was because the medium planes were vast and boundless, and the laws of heaven and earth were very complete. They could already develop their own world.</p><p>only official Ditian divine guards can enter here to cultivate. Reserve Ditian divine guards don’t have the qualifications. Reserve Ditian divine guards live in the myriad stars city and need to go through difficult trials and assessments before they can become Ditian divine guards.</p><p>Deacon Huang continued.</p><p>Many people silently nodded their heads, rejoicing that they had become the Ditian divine guards. If they were to become reserve Ditian divine guards, they would have to undergo countless trials and tribulations. Moreover, the success rate wasn’t high.</p><p>your information has already been sent over. Now, I’ll help you with the procedures to join the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Wait here for a while!</p><p>Deacon Huang continued.</p><p>Everyone saw that there was a huge Palace at the side of the square. People were coming and going in the palace, and it must be the place for them to go through the procedures.</p><p>Not long after, a beautiful young lady came to attendant Huang’s side and handed him a storage ring.</p><p>Deacon Huang took it, and with a flash of light from his storage ring, a purple-gold token appeared in his hand.</p><p>“This is your command token, known as the divine Guard Command token. It records all of your information in the Ditian Divine Guard. At the same time, if you go out, it also represents your identity as a Ditian Divine Guard.”</p><p>the token of the divine guards is made of purple-gold cold iron and is engraved with special inscriptions. Outsiders can’t imitate it. The first one, Lu Ming, is your token of the eastern sky divine guards!</p><p>Deacon Huang said.</p><p>Lu Ming walked up.</p><p>haha, little brother Lu, congratulations! The eastern sky divine guards have many benefits. Not only do you have the right to enter the hundred deities slope once, but the place you live in is also different from the others. Wait a moment, I will take you there!</p><p>Deacon Huang looked at Lu Ming, his face full of smiles.</p><p>“Many thanks, Deacon Huang!”</p><p>Lu Ming said politely and took the purple gold Divine Guard token.</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming with envy.</p><p>Becoming a member of the eastern sky Divine Guard meant that he had a bright future ahead of him. Did he not see that even Deacon Huang was being polite to Lu Ming? he was trying to build a good relationship with him.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Next, zang Sheng. He’s injured now. I’ll give him the next one!</p><p>Attendant Huang took out another token.</p><p>Then, attendant Huang distributed the pieces one by one.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had already walked to the side, holding the divine Guard token, channeling his essential Qi into it and reading it.</p><p>The token was shimmering with a faint glow and a message appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming, nineteen years old, from the blazing sun Empire of the cloud Emperor mountain range, the eastern Palace of the Tianxuan region, level one emperor heaven Divine Guard (Eastern heaven Divine Guard).</p><p>It was just a short message.</p><p>In the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the Empyrean heaven divine guards were divided into many ranks. Rank 1 was the lowest, and there were still ranks 2,3, and 4 above it.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know what the highest level was.</p><p>The others were also watching.</p><p>Soon, Deacon Huang distributed all the tokens.</p><p>“Now, I’ll show you around the Emperor heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Deacon Huang said. Then, he flew towards the vast mountains.</p><p>Everyone rose into the air and followed.</p><p>“I believe all of you know that the Emperor heaven divine Palace has nine great halls. They correspond to the nine common concepts of the heavens and earth, namely wind, fire, water, metal, wood, earth, lightning, ice, and mountain.”</p><p>“However, other than the nine great halls, there are still a few other places in the Empyrean heaven divine Palace that are extremely important and famous. The pagoda in front of you is the heaven connecting Pagoda. You can cultivate in it in the future and also test your cultivation and combat strength!”</p><p>the heaven reaching tower is divided into many levels. There will be a corresponding reward for each level that you pass!</p><p>Deacon Huang pointed to a tall tower in front of them and introduced it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
