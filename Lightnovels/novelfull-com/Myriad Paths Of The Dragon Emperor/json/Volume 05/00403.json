Jian Fengyun’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the 7th tier martial ancestor realm. He was only a step away from the 8th tier. In the cloud Emperor mountain range, he was indeed far ahead. He was much stronger than young master Tian she, who was in second place.</p><p>...</p><p>Of course, he was an exception.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you for saving me this time. Otherwise, I would have died in the hands of these despicable people.”</p><p>Jian Fengyun walked over and cupped his fists to thank Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Jian, you don’t have to be so polite. These people have always been my enemies. Even if this didn’t happen, I would still kill them.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Jian Fengyun could not help but sigh in his heart. It had only been a short while, but Lu Ming’s cultivation level had actually increased to a level that he could not even catch up to. It was truly shocking.</p><p>He was certain that Lu Ming was not this powerful when he first entered the ancient battlefield of the netherworld. Otherwise, he would not have let young master Tian she and the rest off.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you heading to the dragon’s cave?” Jian Fengyun asked after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head.</p><p>that’s great. We were going to the dragon’s cave as well, but we didn’t expect to meet the people from the thousand River region on the way. Tian she and the others actually surrendered to the thousand River region. There were more than a dozen who didn’t surrender, but they were all killed by them.</p><p>Jian Fengyun said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why don’t we go together?”</p><p>Then, Jian Fengyun’s tone changed.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two of them immediately rose into the air and flew in the direction of the dragon’s cave.</p><p>When it was close to evening, they arrived at a strange place.</p><p>From high up in the sky, one could see a series of enormous mountain ranges lying on the ground in front of them, like true dragons.</p><p>It really did look like a real Dragon. One could even vaguely distinguish the dragon’s head and tail.</p><p>this is where the Dragon’s Den is. It’s said that the real Dragon’s Den is in the depths of this area. The vast area around the Dragon’s Den is influenced by the Dragon’s Den, causing the mountain range to take the shape of a Dragon. Furthermore, there are many spiritual herbs and countless treasures!</p><p>however, it’s said that this area is usually covered by a large inscription formation. It’s impossible to find or enter. I didn’t expect it to really open now.</p><p>Jian Fengyun muttered, his eyes bright.</p><p>haha, that means our group is lucky. Let’s go!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming flew forward in a flash.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>When he entered the Dragon’s Den, he was surprised.</p><p>This was because he felt that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth here was even denser. It was very strange. There was only a thin line between them, but the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was completely different.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could feel that the Dragon-shaped vital energy in his body was circulating faster.</p><p>If he could cultivate here, Lu Ming’s cultivation speed would be much faster than other places.</p><p>After pondering for a while, the two of them continued forward.</p><p>Soon, night fell.</p><p>When the two of them were on guard against those spirits, they realized that there were no spirits at all.</p><p>Everything was normal.</p><p>could it be that the dragon’s cave has isolated the entry of those spirits? ”</p><p>Jian Fengyun made a guess. Lu Ming nodded. That was the only reason.</p><p>However, this was a good thing. It saved him a lot of trouble.</p><p>The two of them landed on a mountain peak and closed their eyes to meditate.</p><p>Jian Fengyun had been slightly injured, but it was a good time to heal his injuries.</p><p>After a Night of Silence, the two of them continued on their journey the next morning, towards the depths of this region.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of something breaking through the air came from ahead.</p><p>In front of him, a young Man in Black was running at high speed.</p><p>Behind him, there were dozens of figures chasing him at high speed.</p><p>“Xiao Haoyu, you can’t escape. Just accept your death obediently!”</p><p>Someone called out from behind.</p><p>“The people who were with you are all dead. What’s the point of you dragging out an ignoble existence?”</p><p>A cold laugh rang out.</p><p>In front of him, the young man in Black was running at full speed without a word.</p><p>he’s the strongest person in the valley-Wind Mountain range, Xiao Haoyu. I’ve met him once!</p><p>Jian Fengyun whispered.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and stood in the air. He had no intention of interfering.</p><p>Lu Ming was not a kind person. He would not cause unnecessary trouble for someone he did not know.</p><p>Since Lu Ming did not move, Jian Fengyun naturally did not move either.</p><p>Xiao Haoyu cast a glance at Lu Ming and the rest before he continued dashing forward.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming and the rest did not interfere, it did not mean that others would not cause trouble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, seven to eight figures surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Xiao Haoyu, die!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying blade of light shot out from within that group of people, instantly shattering the void as it slashed towards Xiao Haoyu at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>Xiao Haoyu let out a furious roar and tried his best to defend himself. However, he was struck so hard that he spat out a mouthful of blood. In the next moment, he was also surrounded by the group of people.</p><p>“Everyone, what are you all doing? We don’t seem to have any grudges!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s expression changed.</p><p>“What are you doing? You two, hand over your storage rings. If you hand over your storage rings, I’ll consider sparing your lives!”</p><p>Among the people surrounding them, a skinny young man sneered.</p><p>“My two brothers, don’t listen to them. They are from the Savage Land, a large area. Even if you hand over your storage rings, they will still kill you!”</p><p>Not far away, Xiao Haoyu shouted.</p><p>“Savage Land!”</p><p>Jian Fengyun’s expression changed.</p><p>The savage region was similar to the thousand River region in that it was a large region.</p><p>Among them, there were high-tier empires.</p><p>“Hehe, Xiao Haoyu, what’s the point of shouting so loudly? Do you think they can be spared from death if they don’t hand over their storage rings?”</p><p>A young man with an unusually burly figure, about 2.2 to 2.3 meters tall, and muscles all over his body, who looked like a small giant, sneered.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice was heard.</p><p>His voice was not loud, but it was filled with coldness.</p><p>The voice came from Lu Ming.</p><p>The young man from the barbaric area was stunned for a moment. Then, someone’s expression changed and he said coldly, ” “Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>“I told you to get lost, don’t you understand human language? I’ll give you the time of three breaths. If you don’t get lost after three breaths, then don’t get lost.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was still unhurried, but the coldness in his voice was even stronger.</p><p>brat, you’re looking for death. I’ll crush all the bones in your body right now!</p><p>There were eight strong young men surrounding Lu Ming and his group. They took a big step forward and threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, the strong young man was sent flying a few thousand meters away by Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>How dare you! How dare you fight back! Let’s kill him together!</p><p>The other seven people roared in anger and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, there were seven loud bangs. Each of the seven young men was kicked by Lu Ming and they flew a few thousand meters away. They spat out large mouthfuls of blood and their bodies almost exploded.</p><p>The expressions of the youths surrounding Xiao Haoyu changed drastically.</p><p>Even the unusually burly young man’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Among the eight youths, there were seventh level martial arts Grandmaster geniuses. However, they were still sent flying by Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was shocking.</p><p>“This time, I’ll be kind and spare your lives. Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Brat, you have some strength. Let me test you. As long as you can defeat me, I’ll turn around and leave!”</p><p>The unusually burly young man moved and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
