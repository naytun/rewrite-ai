He had completely entered the ranks of the strongest geniuses in the eastern part of the Tianxuan region.</p><p>...</p><p>If Lu Ming could reach this level, even if he was not Qiu changkong’s match, he would not be too far off. He would definitely be valued by the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. Qiu changkong would more or less have some scruples, and they would have room to negotiate.</p><p>At the scene, everyone looked at elder Feng expectantly, hoping that he would nod.</p><p>Elder Feng nodded. that’s right. Not only did Lu Ming pass the last round, but he also participated in the fight for the Ditian divine guards. He even died!</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, Lu Ming actually passed the last level. That’s great, that’s great. I didn’t misjudge him. Now, the omnipresent sword sect will have to think twice if they want to destroy us!</p><p>Before elder Feng could finish his sentence, Ling potian started laughing madly. His face was filled with joy, and even his beard was raised.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is a genius. I was wrong about him back then!</p><p>Lin Xueyi also sighed, but her eyes were also filled with ecstasy.</p><p>“I knew it. Lu Ming will definitely create miracles!”</p><p>Hua Chi’s face was also filled with ecstasy.</p><p>The others were also all smiling and extremely excited.</p><p>Previously, they did not expect that Lu Ming could actually reach this level. This was really great news.</p><p>haha, someone, tell this good news to old master Lu and Madam Lu!</p><p>Lin Xueyi laughed.</p><p>“Wait, wait a moment, sect leader, I’m not done yet.”</p><p>Elder Feng cried out again.</p><p>The entire place fell silent again.</p><p>I say, brother, you’re a big man. Can’t you just say everything in one go? don’t be so wishy-washy.</p><p>Ling potian called out.</p><p>“Sect master Ling, I wanted to say it just now, but you interrupted me.”</p><p>Elder Feng said with a bitter expression.</p><p>“This … Hehe … Weren’t you too excited just now?”</p><p>Ling potian grinned.</p><p>alright, elder Feng. If there’s any other news, please tell us.</p><p>Lin Xueyi said.</p><p>“Yes, sect master. It’s about Lu Ming. Not only did he participate in the battle for the eastern sky divine guards, but he also won the throne of the eastern sky divine guards in the end.”</p><p>Elder Feng nodded and told him the news in one breath.</p><p>When he finished, he felt that the atmosphere was not right.</p><p>Silence! There was complete silence. Not even the sound of breathing could be heard.</p><p>Everyone was stunned as they stared at elder Feng in a daze.</p><p>Elder Feng laughed bitterly. He had expected everyone to react this way. When he first heard the news, he had also had this expression on his face. In fact, it was even more exaggerated.</p><p>“East … The eastern sky divine guards? You … Are you saying that Lu Ming has taken over the eastern sky divine guards?”</p><p>After a long time, Lin Xueyi was the first to react and asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Brother, is this news true? You’re not lying to us, right?” Ling potian asked in a daze. He simply couldn’t believe it.</p><p>it’s true. The cloud desolate Empire’s royal family has already confirmed this news. They might even send people over to congratulate.</p><p>Elder Feng said.</p><p>Lin Xueyi, Ling potian, Hua Chi, and the others looked at each other. They could see the indescribable excitement in each other’s eyes.</p><p>eastern sky divine guards, eastern sky divine guards, hahaha, what will the ten direction sword sect do now? ”</p><p>Ling potian laughed wildly.</p><p>“Peerless genius, peerless genius.”</p><p>Shangguan Ming sighed.</p><p>As for Hua Chi and those who were on good terms with Lu Ming, such as Yan LAN, they were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>LAN ‘er, you have good taste. This time, you have hope!</p><p>Yan LAN sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to have reached this stage.”</p><p>Yan Quan also sighed in his heart.</p><p>He was glad that he had made the decision to help Lu Ming for ten years.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, he believed that Lu Ming would surpass him very soon. In fact, Lu Ming had already surpassed him. In the future, he would most likely still need Lu Ming’s help.</p><p>At the scene, everyone was extremely excited. They were just short of shouting out loud to express their emotions.</p><p>They did not even dare to dream that Lu Ming could actually take over the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>This was like stepping on the strongest geniuses from many super large regions.</p><p>It was already unimaginable to be able to fight for the eastern sky divine guards, let alone the eastern sky divine guards.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming would definitely be put in an important position. Qiu changkong would definitely not dare to act rashly and use his power to interfere in the affairs of the burning sun Empire.</p><p>“Sect leader, sect leader!”</p><p>At this moment, a silver-robed elder rushed in.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lin Xueyi was in a good mood and asked with a smile.</p><p>sect leader, the cloud desolate Empire royal family is here to congratulate!</p><p>The silver robed elder said. He didn’t know about the news and was a little surprised. He didn’t know why the cloud desolate Empire royal family had come.</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire was without a doubt the strongest out of the 36 empires of Emperor Yun. It was more than ten times stronger than the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>he’s really here. Quick, go out and welcome him!</p><p>Lin Xueyi quickly got up.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>When they arrived at the mountain Gate of the mystical sword sect, they saw dozens of people.</p><p>There was a total of more than 30 people, all of whom were standing in the air. Without a doubt, they were all martial ancestor realm powerhouses.</p><p>The one in the lead was wearing a dragon robe, and he was emitting a powerful aura. He was a half-step King.</p><p>cloud desolate Empire’s honored guests have arrived. Please forgive me for not welcoming you!</p><p>Lin Xueyi quickly cupped her fists.</p><p>you must be sect leader Lin of the mystic essence sword sect. Haha, no need to be so polite. I am the Qi king of the cloud desolate Empire and I am here to congratulate sect leader Lin.</p><p>I heard that Lu Ming is from the mystical sword sect. I didn’t expect that the mystical sword sect would have a genius like Lu Ming. He won the East heaven divine guards and greatly increased the prestige and reputation of the 36 kingdoms of the cloud Emperor. He has also increased the reputation of the cloud Emperor mountain range. Therefore, I’m here to congratulate him!</p><p>The middle-aged man in the flood dragon robe said.</p><p>Lin Xueyi and the others were extremely excited.</p><p>Previously, when elder Feng said that, even though they were extremely excited, they were still afraid that there might be a mistake in the news. But now that even the Prince of the cloud desolate Empire had come personally to congratulate, there was definitely no mistake.</p><p>“Your Highness, please come in. Someone, prepare a banquet to welcome Your Highness!”</p><p>Lin Xueyi loudly ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Someone immediately went to carry out the order.</p><p>also, inform old master Lu and Madam Lu about this news. Also, invite old master Lu and Madam Lu over. Remember, you must be respectful and can’t show the slightest neglect!</p><p>Lin Xueyi ordered.</p><p>“Yes, don’t worry, sect leader!”</p><p>One of the gold-robed elders left to carry out the order.</p><p>“Oh? So Lu Ming’s parents are here as well. I would like to see what kind of person can give birth to such a peerless genius like Lu Ming!”</p><p>The cloud desolate Empire’s Da Qi King laughed.</p><p>The mystical sword sect held a grand banquet to celebrate the occasion.</p><p>When Lu Yuntian and Li Ping heard the news, they were incomparably excited and happy. Li Ping was so moved that tears flowed down her face.</p><p>In contrast to the celebration in the mystical sword sect, the conference hall in the ten direction sword sect was filled with tension.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, damn that Lu Ming! How did he take over the eastern sky divine guards? how is that possible?”</p><p>Qiu Wuyang roared, exuding a terrifying aura and cold killing intent.</p><p>In the main hall, the others were silent, not making a sound.</p><p>After a long time, Qiu Wuyang’s voice was heard again.”Pass on my order. Pull back our forces and wait for news from long sky!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
