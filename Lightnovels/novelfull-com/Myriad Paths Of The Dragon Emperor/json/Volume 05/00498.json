When the tenth palm was about to be struck, a long roar came from the eastern sky courtyard. A word cracked on the light screen, and a figure rushed out.</p><p>...</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. He has rushed out!</p><p>it’s unwise. It’s really unwise. The opponent can’t break the inscription formation in the eastern sky courtyard. If I were Lu Ming, I would hide in the eastern sky courtyard so that the opponent can’t do anything. I’m just courting death by rushing out now!</p><p>“Lu Ming is young and impetuous. He’s talented too. Of course, he can’t stand it when he’s being bullied. It’s a pity that the opponent this time is a direct descendant of the Sheng family, a powerful King. Xue Chao can’t compare to him. Lu Ming is in danger this time.”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void and saw Sheng Wushuang, Sheng Kong, and Sheng Wei at a glance.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang, it’s you again! I think you’re looking for death!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily, his eyes emitting cold killing intent.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, don’t be so arrogant. This time, you’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang sneered without fear.</p><p>The sacred sky stepped forward and looked at Lu Ming arrogantly. “So you’re Lu Ming. Very good. I thought you’d be like a turtle hiding in its shell and not coming out. Now that you’re out, quickly destroy your cultivation and follow me to the central region of the Tianxuan region!”</p><p>Sacred sky placed his hands behind his back and ordered.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Holy sky as if he was looking at an idiot.</p><p>Who was this guy? Did he have a problem with his brain? the moment he came out, he asked Lu Ming to destroy his cultivation and leave with him. Who did he think he was?</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming spoke up and said indifferently, ” where did this wild dog come from? why are you barking in front of my door? do you want to be my guard dog? ”</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming said that, Holy sky was stunned. Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him like that?</p><p>“Bastard, do you know who I am? Listen well, I’m a member of the Sheng family, a direct descendant of the Sheng family. Now, kneel down and admit your mistake, slap yourself a hundred times, and then destroy your own cultivation!”</p><p>Sheng Kong shouted.</p><p>“What Bullsh * t Sheng family? I’ve never heard of them. You were the one who attacked the eastern heaven courtyard just now, right? Very well, you’ve struck nine times in total. I’ll give you nine slaps before you can leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Everyone nearby was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely arrogant. He was so arrogant in front of the direct descendant of the Sheng family. He was simply courting death.</p><p>Even without the Sheng family’s name, the other party was still a powerful martial King. Lu Ming was simply courting death.</p><p>However, they did not know that Lu Ming had never heard of the Sheng family. Moreover, given Lu Ming’s character, even if he knew, he would have the same attitude.</p><p>Sheng Kong, Sheng Wei, and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>Especially Saint Kong, whose face was flushed red and his body was bursting with intense killing intent. He was so angry that he was trembling. He glared at Lu Ming and roared, ” “Little bastard, you’re looking for death. You’re looking for death. No one can save you.”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A tsunami-like aura burst out of the Saint air. The terrifying pressure spread out for ten miles.</p><p>what a strong aura. This is a Lv 2 martial King realm expert. Who is it? ” You dare to attack in the residence of the Ditian divine guards?”</p><p>In the distance, many figures rushed out of a mountain peak.</p><p>The previous batch of Ditian divine guards lived on this mountain peak. Many of them had even broken through to the martial King realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Ditian divine guards were also flying over.</p><p>When they found out that it was a direct descendant of the Sheng family, they were all shocked. No one dared to interfere.</p><p>“Now, kneel!”</p><p>die! the Holy sky roared and stepped forward. He waved his palm and a huge khaki palm pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>he’s so strong. He’s at the LV 2 martial King realm, and his combat strength is definitely at the top of the LV 2 martial King realm. He’s a peerless genius.</p><p>Lu Ming is finished. This person is more than ten times stronger than Xue Chao!</p><p>As soon as the Holy air made its move, all sorts of thoughts flashed through the minds of the people around him.</p><p>you’re just a Lv 2 martial King realm martial artist. What’s there to be proud of? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard just as the huge khaki palm was about to hit Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch. The huge khaki palm exploded as if it was made of tofu. Lu Ming stepped forward. In a flash, he appeared in front of the Holy sky.</p><p>The Holy sky did not expect Lu Ming to be able to break through his attack so easily and appear in front of him so quickly.</p><p>According to the Thunder Palace Master and Sheng Wushuang, wasn’t lu Ming only a half-step King two months ago? How could a half-step King have such a strong battle-power?</p><p>Therefore, it was already too late for him to Dodge.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand and slapped.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of the slap spread far and wide. The slap made Saint Kong spin more than ten times on the spot. He then looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>He was completely stunned.</p><p>The others were also stunned.</p><p>All of them widened their eyes and stared at it.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually slapped Holy sky. How did he do it?</p><p>The aura that had just burst out from the Holy sky had reached Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>Everyone thought they were dreaming.</p><p>“The first slap, eight more slaps!”</p><p>It was only when Lu Ming’s indifferent voice rang out that everyone came to their senses.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Immediately, gasps were heard.</p><p>A King, a King. To be able to defeat Sheng Kong’s attack and slap him, he was definitely a King.</p><p>Lu Ming had already reached the king’s realm. How was this possible? Wasn’t this speed a little too fast?</p><p>Not long ago, when Lu Ming challenged Xue Chao, he was only a half-step King. In less than two months, Lu Ming had already reached the king realm. He was simply a monster.</p><p>One had to know that even peerless geniuses would have to stay at the half-step King realm for a period of time. It could be as short as a year, or as long as several years before they could attempt to break through to the king realm.</p><p>Furthermore, the success rate was not high.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had actually become a King in just a few months. Moreover, he had even slapped a second grade martial King realm genius in the face. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Especially Sheng Wushuang, who was so shocked that his eyes were about to pop out and his body was trembling violently.</p><p>A few months ago, he had reprimanded Lu Ming. He could still remember it clearly. Now, Lu Ming had completely left him in the dust.</p><p>”</p><p>Only then did the sacred sky react and let out a crazy cry.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and slapped shengkong’s face again. Shengkong’s scream stopped abruptly and his body flew far away.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>On the side, saintly might let out an angry cry. A terrifying aura burst out of his body. Strands of red flames surrounded him. The scorching aura spread out, burning and twisting the space.</p><p>The aura of a peak Lv 2 martial King realm.</p><p>“Blazing Dragon Fist!”</p><p>die! he roared and threw a punch. A Dragon of flames pounced at Lu Ming with its fangs and claws bared. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Even an ordinary warrior of the early stage of the third level of the martial King realm would not dare to take this attack head-on.</p><p>There was no doubt that shengwei was a peerless genius. He could even cross levels to fight a martial King.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>The demon subduing spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He thrust the spear forward and a three-colored true dragon flew out.</p><p>The two true dragons collided in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
