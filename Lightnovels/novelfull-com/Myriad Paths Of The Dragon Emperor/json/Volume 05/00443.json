His combat strength was more than six levels higher than an ordinary martial arts Grandmaster ninth level peak.</p><p>Lu Ming, with his cultivation at the peak of the ninth level martial arts Grandmaster realm, was actually able to win. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached Level Seven?</p><p>At the thought of this, everyone sucked in a cold breath, their eyes revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p>A genius after seven battles, how was this possible?</p><p>Was there such a genius in the Eastern Region of the Tianxuan region?</p><p>Even the previous batch of Ditian divine guards looked at Lu Ming with grave gazes.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>In the crowd, zang Sheng and Qiu changkong’s faces were ashen. Their eyes were wide open, unable to accept what was happening.</p><p>It had only been slightly more than a month and Lu Ming had become so powerful. Now, even if the two of them joined forces, Lu Ming could kill them in one move.</p><p>“No, I must think of a way to get rid of Lu Ming. This guy is too terrifying. If this goes on, I’ll be the one who dies!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes glowed with a sinister light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming swung his spear and threw Cai Gou’s corpse away. At the same time, he sucked in his essential Qi and Cai Gou’s storage ring was sucked into Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>As for Cai Gou’s blood essence, there were too many people at the scene. Lu Ming did not devour it.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>As Cai Gou’s corpse fell to the ground, everyone heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>I hereby announce that Cai Gou has failed his challenge. The eastern sky Divine Guard is still Lu Ming!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and was about to turn and leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not bad!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear and cold voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>A young man with a sword-shaped mark between his eyebrows was Walking in the Air, step by step, towards the fighting ring.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang, it’s Sheng Wushuang. What is he doing on the fighting ring? ”</p><p>could it be that he is excited and wants to challenge Lu Ming? ”</p><p>no way. If that’s the case, there’ll be a good show to watch today.</p><p>This young man was none other than the divine Guard of the Western Paradise, who was known as the most powerful genius of this batch, Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang stepped into the fighting ring and stood a hundred meters in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not bad. You’re worthy of being my opponent now.”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang was handsome and had his hands behind his back.</p><p>The surrounding young women looked at Sheng Wushuang with shining eyes.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. Oh, ” he said.</p><p>To be honest, he had never heard of Sheng Wushuang.</p><p>“However, you’re only worthy of being my opponent now. In the future, you might not be. Lu Ming, let me tell you, you’ve already taken the wrong path.”</p><p>Sheng Wushuang continued.</p><p>He had his hands behind his back, as if he was an elder giving advice to a junior.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Was there something wrong with this brother’s brain? He felt too good about himself. On what basis did he say that he had taken the wrong path?</p><p>The others were stunned, and only a few of them had thoughtful expressions.</p><p>“Haven’t you realized it yourself? You’ve comprehended two types of forces at the same time. Although it’s a great boost to your combat power, a person’s energy is limited. It takes a lifetime to comprehend one type of force and one type of essence realm of heaven and earth, but you’ve comprehended two at the same time. In the short term, you might seem powerful, but it’s actually an extremely stupid move.”</p><p>in the future, even if you can break through to the martial King realm, your achievements will be limited. That’s why I said that you can be my opponent now, but in the future, the gap between you and me will only grow further and further. You will never be able to catch up with me.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang continued with great confidence.</p><p>that’s right. Sheng Wushuang is right. Comprehending two types of force will greatly increase your strength in the short term. However, it will definitely affect your cultivation in the future.</p><p>The people around them felt that what Sheng Wushuang said made sense.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Moreover, Sheng Wushuang’s attitude really pissed Lu Ming off. Hence, Lu Ming glanced at him indifferently and said, ” “Who the hell are you? You have your own path, I have mine, I don’t need you to tell me. ”</p><p>moreover, for someone like you, surpassing you is just a matter of minutes.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually.</p><p>you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. You’ve gone astray and even tried to surpass me. What a joke. I’m kind enough to give you advice, but you don’t appreciate it. Fine, I’ll just let you live and die on your own.</p><p>Sheng Wushuang snorted and left with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with this guy’s brain? who does he think he is? He looks like the number one expert in the world, how laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then rose into the air and left the place.</p><p>Of course, this battle could not help but become the topic of discussion for others.</p><p>However, no one dared to look down on Lu Ming anymore. Lu Ming had used his own strength to prove that he deserved to be the eastern sky Divine Guard.</p><p>Moreover, what Sheng Wushuang said had spread.</p><p>Most of the people agreed with Sheng Wushuang. There was a limit to how much energy a person could put into comprehending two types of Shi at the same time. If Lu Ming did not correct his mistakes, his future achievements would be limited.</p><p>……</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to the eastern sky courtyard, he continued to comprehend the force of Wind and Fire.</p><p>Naturally, he would not give up on cultivating the wind-Fire Force just because of what Sheng Wushuang said.</p><p>Ever since he had comprehended the Wind and Fire Force and fused them, the Wind and Fire Force had been of great help to Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, the Dragon God’s three absolutes wasn’t just a single force or intent realm that could unleash its power. Therefore, he had to cultivate the Wind and Fire forces together.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had another ambition. He wanted to comprehend the force of lightning and combine wind, fire, and lightning to cultivate the Dragon God’s three absolutes to the highest realm.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>On another mountain peak, in a courtyard.</p><p>Qiu changkong and a young man in purple were sitting opposite each other.</p><p>damn it. How can that b * stard Lu Ming be so powerful? how can his cultivation level improve so quickly? damn it!</p><p>Qiu changkong roared in anger.</p><p>“Junior Brother, don’t be impatient. In my opinion, Lu Ming must have had some fortuitous encounter or he has some treasure on him.”</p><p>The young man in purple picked up a cup of wine, took a sip, and smiled.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely be able to recognize that this young man was the one who had sent the invitation letter to the blazing sun Empire.</p><p>“Senior brother, what should we do now? Why don’t we ask master to come forward and find a reason to execute Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qiu changkong’s eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>“Silly!”</p><p>“Master, although you’re the master of the Thunder Hall, one of the nine halls, Lu Ming is the eastern sky Divine Guard this time. He’s under the attention of the other Hall Masters. If you attack Lu Ming, you’ll definitely upset the hall Masters. It might even alarm the palace Master. At that time, you’ll find it hard to explain and you’ll be punished!”</p><p>I can’t just watch Lu Ming improve continuously. I’m afraid that it will be difficult to suppress him when he grows up.</p><p>Qiu changkong asked anxiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
