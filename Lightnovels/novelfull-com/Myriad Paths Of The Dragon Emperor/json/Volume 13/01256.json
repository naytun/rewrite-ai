Lu Ming stepped into it.</p><p>At the same time, in the other battle platforms, there were also many space passages that converged. Bing Kong, Yi Dian, Zi Wuji, Jian Zhan, and the others had also easily defeated their opponents and entered the next round.</p><p>On the divine wilderness continent’s side, Long Chen easily defeated his opponent and advanced to the next stage. Xie nianqing, who had attained the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm and obtained the inheritance of an unparalleled existence, advanced to the next stage with terrifying combat strength.</p><p>In addition, Xie nianjun’s cultivation had improved a lot during this period of time. He had actually entered the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm and defeated his opponent to enter the next stage.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk and yang potian also passed by luck. However, Dark Child and the moonless female Bodhisattva encountered strong enemies and were defeated and eliminated.</p><p>In the outside world, countless people were watching. The experts from the four major forces of the yuan continent were also watching carefully to see if there were any good seedlings that were suitable for their sects.</p><p>Soon, the first stage was almost over.</p><p>Originally, there were more than five hundred people. About one hundred people did not pass the first stage, and half of the remaining four hundred people would be eliminated if they fought in pairs. Only about two hundred people could continue to advance and pass the second stage.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void channel again and continued to move forward. After about a thousand meters, his surroundings suddenly changed and he appeared in an unfamiliar environment.</p><p>In the surroundings, powerful auras rose up like smoke. Countless experts were killing each other, and their murderous intent was shocking.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword ray slashed at Lu Ming. Lu Ming threw a punch and shattered the sword ray.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A burly man with a huge sword in his hand charged at Lu Ming with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Why did he suddenly come here?</p><p>“It’s an illusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully and suddenly raised his eyebrows. He saw something fishy.</p><p>This should be an illusion. Lu Ming was in an illusion.</p><p>“Everything is an illusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His heart was unmoved and he stuck to his heart.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>A few armored generals with giant axes and long Spears charged at Lu Ming. Their intense killing intent sent chills down everyone’s spine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to notice it. He allowed the huge axe and long spear to hit him, his expression calm.</p><p>A shocking scene happened. The huge axes and long Spears struck Lu Ming’s body, but it was as if they had struck the void or an illusion. Lu Ming was completely unharmed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he stepped forward.</p><p>This was a battlefield, and the killing was extremely intense. Blood was everywhere, and the killing intent was as cold as a blade. When one was in it, it felt extremely real, as if it had really happened.</p><p>Those with weak will, even if they knew that this was an illusion, would inevitably be affected and thus develop fear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s resistance to illusions was already very strong.</p><p>His heart was unmoved as he walked on the battlefield, unmoving like a mountain, even when the swords and sabers were on his body.</p><p>His pace was not very fast. Step by step, he walked on the battlefield.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>There was a loud shout in the sky. A palm print, like the hand of heaven, fell towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This was definitely the palm of an Emperor. At this moment, Lu Ming had an illusion that he would be reduced to ashes immediately if the palm landed.</p><p>This feeling made Lu Ming have an instinctive urge to retaliate, to counterattack, and to save himself.</p><p>This was a human’s instinct. Anyone would have this instinct in such a situation.</p><p>“No, if I make a move, I’ll only sink deeper and deeper!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and endured the attack, allowing the palm print to land on him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the palm print dispersed, but Lu Ming was completely fine.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief. The feeling of being slapped to death in the next moment and having to hold back and not retaliate was not a good feeling.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. Following that, all sorts of attacks landed on him. There were even attacks that exceeded the third level of the Emperor realm. However, Lu Ming remained unmoved.</p><p>He walked through the battlefield alone. In the end, he used half an hour to cross the entire battlefield.</p><p>When Lu Ming passed through the battlefield, it disappeared and he reappeared in the void channel.</p><p>There was a flash of light ahead. Lu Ming walked over and found another fighting ring.</p><p>There was no one in the fighting ring. Lu Ming stepped into the fighting ring and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>In the outside world, everyone was watching seriously.</p><p>“I wonder who will be the first to pass the second stage!”</p><p>I heard from the experts of the heaven deity sect that the second stage is an extremely strong illusionary realm. It tests one’s willpower and is extremely difficult. Up until now, more than 30 people have failed to pass the stage and have been eliminated. In my opinion, the strongest heaven’s pride experts of the four divine palaces are still the most likely to pass the second stage!</p><p>that’s right. Bing Kong, Eden, Zi Wuji, and Jian Zhan are the most likely candidates. However, it’s not impossible for Xue Mingyang and Lu Ming to be the candidates!</p><p>although Xue Mingyang and Lu Ming are very strong, they are still slightly weaker than the other four!</p><p>The surrounding onlookers had already known the contents of the second stage from the experts of the Tian Shen sect. At this moment, they were all guessing who was the first person to pass the second stage.</p><p>At that moment, another light spot appeared in front of the first row of light spots. It was the same as the first row of light spots, and inside it was a battle platform.</p><p>A void tunnel appeared.</p><p>“Who’s the first to succeed?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the void passage.</p><p>A young man stepped out and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s actually him, Lu Ming!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect it to be Lu Ming. He’s the first to clear the second stage!”</p><p>“Amazing, amazing! Don’t tell me that Lu Ming has the ability to suppress everyone and get first place?”</p><p>not necessarily. For Lu Ming to be able to come this far from a small continent like the divine wilderness continent, his will and willpower must be very shocking. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to come this far. However, this does not necessarily mean that he has combat power. It’s hard to say who will be the final number one!</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance caused an uproar at the scene.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly Divine sect snorted coldly. He was rather unhappy.</p><p>young master Lin’s eyes were about to spit fire.</p><p>“Haha, not bad, not bad, this kid is not bad!”</p><p>The leader of the Dragon God Valley team burst into laughter. He looked at Lu Ming in the fighting ring with admiration.</p><p>The other experts from the jiuxiao sword sect and the Tianyu demonic sect also nodded.</p><p>In the path of cultivation, determination and willpower were also very important.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the fighting ring and continued to wait.</p><p>In the outside world, after Lu Ming’s appearance, light spots began to appear one by one. This time, the number one genius of the eastern God Palace, Eden, followed closely behind Lu Ming. He was the young man with the guqin on his back.</p><p>After that, it was the ice sky of the North God Palace.</p><p>Then, Zi Wuji of the South God Palace, Jian Zhan of the West God Palace, and Xue Mingyang of the blood Sun continent appeared almost at the same time.</p><p>After them, the first to appear was actually Long Chen, which surprised many people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
