Surprisingly, Xie nianqing appeared at almost the same time as these heaven’s favorites.</p><p>...</p><p>Slowly, more and more fighting rings appeared, and the number of people eliminated had reached about 50.</p><p>Of the two hundred people, about fifty were eliminated, leaving about a hundred and fifty.</p><p>At this time, more than 70 fighting platforms had appeared in the void. When more than 70 fighting platforms had appeared, the void channel where the winners of the next round were in began to merge with the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes. A passage appeared on one side of the fighting ring. At the entrance of the passage, a young man stepped out.</p><p>Just like before, the young man’s face turned pale when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“How unlucky!”</p><p>The man muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s battle with young master Lin was too powerful. Those who had seen him fight knew very well that they were no match for Lu Ming. Meeting Lu Ming was equivalent to ending the assessment early.</p><p>“I will fight with all my strength!”</p><p>The young man shouted loudly. He used all his strength and rushed toward Lu Ming. However, the result was obvious. He was easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the other fighting rings, battles also broke out.</p><p>This battle was equivalent to the battle between the top 75 and the top 150. This battle was much more intense than the previous one, because those who could make it to the end would be stronger and stronger.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites like Eden and Bing Kong easily defeated their opponents and won.</p><p>“That is … The bloodline of the ancient dragon elephant!”</p><p>The Dragon God Valley’s experts were paying attention to the battles on the battle platforms. Suddenly, their eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>On one of the battle platforms, Long Chen used his bloodline fusion and crushed his opponent, winning the battle.</p><p>it’s really the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline. It’s really shocking. There are actually nine Dragon bloodlines in a mere continent group of the divine Ruins. Now, even the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline has appeared.</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect sighed.</p><p>that woman is not bad either. Such pure demonic Qi and demonic will!</p><p>An expert from the Tianyu demonic sect stared at one of the battle platforms. Xie nianqing was fighting against another heaven’s favorite, and Xie nianqing had also won easily.</p><p>Ever since Xie nianqing obtained the inheritance of that demonic cultivator, her cultivation and combat strength had been improving rapidly.</p><p>“Also, that one is not bad …”</p><p>The powerhouses from the four great forces of the yuan continent were paying attention to the battles on each fighting ring. They nodded their heads frequently. Obviously, some people made them quite satisfied.</p><p>In the end, all the battles came to an end. The losers were all eliminated, and the victors moved on to the next stage.</p><p>On the divine wilderness continent’s side, yang potian, the unscrupulous monk, lost to his opponent due to his lacking cultivation.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, Long Chen, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun, they had all advanced.</p><p>After Lu Ming won, he continued to step into the void channel.</p><p>This round was more difficult than the previous two. Not only did it test one’s determination, but it also tested one’s combat power. However, to Lu Ming, it was still an easy pass.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was the first one to pass the third level and appeared on another platform.</p><p>This round was not too difficult for Lu Ming. However, it was extremely difficult for the other geniuses. Twenty-five people were eliminated in this round.</p><p>Only the remaining 50 people successfully passed the test.</p><p>“Eh? What a coincidence!”</p><p>When the void passages converged, a figure stepped into the fighting ring where Lu Ming was. Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Wang Zhen!</p><p>The person who had stepped into Lu Ming’s fighting ring was Wang Zhen, one of the three strongest geniuses of the South God Palace.</p><p>When Wang Zhen saw Lu Ming, his face darkened and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>it’s Wang Zhen. Wang Zhen actually met Lu Ming so early!</p><p>“This match is going to be interesting!”</p><p>interesting. A battle between two strong powerhouses!</p><p>Many people revealed excited expressions.</p><p>Wang Zhen was one of the three strongest heaven’s favorites in the South God Palace. Although his reputation was not as good as Zi Wuji’s, he was not to be underestimated. In the entire continent of the divine Ruins, Wang Zhen was the top heaven’s favorite.</p><p>His combat strength was definitely not weak. Although the combat strength that Lu Ming displayed was very strong, they had not fought before. It was still unknown who was stronger and weaker!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re quite powerful. Unfortunately, you’ve offended too many people. How about we make a deal? If you lose to me, I can help you settle those troubles!”</p><p>Wang Zhen’s eyes turned as he spoke.</p><p>“Help me settle the trouble? Hehe, I want to know how you’re going to settle this. For example, that young master Lin must hate me to the core right now. How do you want to settle this?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a faint smile.</p><p>my Wang family still has some influence in the South God Palace. If you lose to me on purpose, I will put in a few good words for you in front of young master Lin. At that time, you can apologize and this matter will be over.</p><p>Wang Zhen said confidently.</p><p>“Hehe, you want me to lose to you so that you can be chosen by the major sects of the yuanlu continent, right? Since your Wang family is so capable, why don’t you just put in a few good words for yourself? then you can join a big sect in the yuanlu continent. Why do you need to play such a low-level trick?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a mocking expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m talking to you nicely. Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. If we really have to fight, I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>Wang Zhen said with a gloomy face.</p><p>then why are you still talking? make your move. You don’t have to worry about my matters!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You don’t know how to appreciate my kindness!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wang Zhen said coldly as he took a step forward. As he did so, a milky white light shot up from his body.</p><p>This light was incomparably Holy, as if it could purify all evil.</p><p>“Divine sword of holy light!”</p><p>Wang Zhen was bathed in the pure white holy light. He clenched his hands in the air and two pure white combat swords appeared in his hands. The two combat swords crossed and slashed out, forming a cross-shaped sword Qi that was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. With a flash of his body, he dodged the cross-shaped sword aura and charged toward Wang Zhen.</p><p>“Holy light Storm!”</p><p>Wang Zhen’s figure continued to spin, and endless holy light was driven, forming a sword storm that poured toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed contemptuously and burst out with nine streams of dragon energy. He activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>The prison suppressing heavenly art could suppress everything. Even if you had tens of thousands of sword Qi, you could break them with a single punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The endless sword Qi storm was shattered in an instant. Wang Zhen’s expression changed. He crossed his swords in front of him to block Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>With a loud thud, Wang Zhen was sent flying by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>“Hmph, I don’t believe it. Supreme holy light technique!”</p><p>Wang Zhen shouted, and a battle armor appeared above his head. It was a milky white battle armor, and the Holy Light was vast and mighty, like the deep sea.</p><p>This was Wang Zhen’s bloodline, a battle armor.</p><p>Moreover, when Wang Zhen used the bloodline fusion, it was very strange. It was somewhat different from the others. When he used the bloodline fusion, it was as if he was wearing a battle armor directly on his body, causing his aura to soar wildly.</p><p>A milky white ray of light shot towards Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
