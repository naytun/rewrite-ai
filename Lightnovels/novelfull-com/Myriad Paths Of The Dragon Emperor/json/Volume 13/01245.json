The hundred deities slope was formed from the descent of numerous powerful corpses from the sky countless years ago.</p><p>The lightning cauldron was most likely a Supreme treasure.</p><p>Moreover, the hundred deities slope had been explored for so many years, yet it was still preserved. Furthermore, it had actually transcended its own tribulation back then. It was definitely not ordinary. Lu Ming felt that it was unfathomable.</p><p>In the past, he couldn’t control it at all. It was only when his Thunder concept broke through to the complete stage of level four that he could barely control the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>However, Lu Ming felt that he had not exerted much of the lightning cauldron’s power. The power contained in the lightning cauldron seemed to be infinite.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the round bead he had encountered at the hundred deities slope years ago. It contained powerful wind energy. It must be extraordinary to be able to remain untouched for so many years at the hundred deities slope. Lu Ming thought to himself that if he had the chance, he would definitely go to the hundred deities slope again.</p><p>With the help of the lightning cauldron, Lu Ming was relieved and strode forward.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The closer he was to the Thunder Phoenix Tree, the more terrifying and powerful the power of the Thunder between heaven and earth was.</p><p>By the time they were ten miles away from the Thunder Phoenix Tree, the power of the Thunder had reached a terrifying level.</p><p>“The lightning here is so powerful that even paragons would be in danger. They’d be heavily injured, or even killed!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>It was no wonder that the dark Thunder Supreme was guarding the nearby area and didn’t come in to collect the Thunder Phoenix Tree. That was because the dark Thunder Supreme couldn’t even get close to the Thunder Phoenix Tree. If he walked in, he might die Here.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the lightning cauldron, so there was no problem at all. The boundless power of lightning between heaven and earth was all absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and kept approaching the Thunder Phoenix Tree.</p><p>Ten miles, nine miles, eight miles …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was only a mile away from the Thunder Phoenix Tree.</p><p>At that moment, a Phoenix’s cry was heard. A Phoenix that was completely condensed from lightning spread its wings and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Its eyes were filled with ferocity, and it was as vivid as a real phoenix.</p><p>With a screech, the lightning Phoenix pounced toward the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The lightning cauldron trembled, and a vast pressure of the Dao of lightning spread out.</p><p>This pressure enveloped the lightning Phoenix. The lightning Phoenix let out a wail and actually let out an extremely terrified cry as it retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. The lightning cauldron flew forward and suppressed the lightning Phoenix.</p><p>The Phoenix cried out in fear. It was unable to resist at all as it was suppressed by the lightning cauldron. In the end, it turned into lightning and was absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Then, the lightning cauldron hovered above the Thunder Phoenix Tree, exuding the might of lightning. It was as if a superior was giving orders to a subordinate.</p><p>During this process, a strange scene happened. The Thunder Phoenix Tree shone, and the endless thunder and lightning around it weakened. Slowly, the area returned to normal, and there was no more powerful thunder and lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He strode forward and grabbed the Thunder Phoenix Tree.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Thunder cauldron, the Thunder Phoenix tree’s lightning power was completely retracted. It did not harm Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Lu Ming plucked the Thunder Phoenix Tree and sensed it carefully. He could still feel the rich power of thunder and lightning from the Thunder Phoenix Tree. If Lu Ming used the Thunder Phoenix Tree to cultivate the Thundergod strike, the results would be outstanding.</p><p>“I’m looking for a place to cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, dug out the Thunder Phoenix Tree, and left the place.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming found a mountain peak rich in lightning energy. He opened up a cave abode in the middle of the mountain peak. Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the cave abode and with a thought, the Thunder Phoenix Tree appeared in his hands.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Wisps of lightning emanated from the Thunder Phoenix Tree and enveloped Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was bathed in the rich power of lightning. He closed his eyes and combined the rich power of lightning to cultivate the Thundergod strike.</p><p>With the help of the Thunder Phoenix Tree, Lu Ming’s understanding of the Thundergod strike improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>In just two days, the Thundergod strike had broken through and reached the second level.</p><p>Nine days later, Thundergod strike broke through again and reached the third level.</p><p>There were still a few days before the start of the second round. Lu Ming planned to cultivate until the last day before returning to the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>……</p><p>Five to six figures appeared not far from Lu Ming’s cultivation place.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of them. It was the lightning bull whose arm Lu Ming had cut off.</p><p>The other people were all Lei Niu’s subordinates.</p><p>“Young master Niu, the power of the lightning cauldron here is not bad. You can cultivate here!”</p><p>An old man said.</p><p>this won’t do. The power of Thunder here still hasn’t reached my expectations. I must find a place with extremely dense power of the Thunder cauldron. I’m still a little short of recovering my Yuan Qi, but I haven’t fully recovered yet. I need a place with extremely dense power of Thunder to fully recover!</p><p>The Thunder bull said.</p><p>At the mention of this, he thought of Lu Ming and his eyes could not help but flash with fire. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>If it were not for Lu Ming, he would not have ended up in such a state. Everyone else was seizing the time to break through, but he was seizing the time to recover. In this way, he had unknowingly pulled apart from others.</p><p>“It’s all that guy’s fault. Lu Ming, I don’t know where he has been hiding all this time. I must find an opportunity to take revenge!”</p><p>The lightning bull gritted his teeth.</p><p>Suddenly, his nose twitched a few times, and two horns appeared on his forehead, flashing with the power of Thunder.</p><p>there’s a powerful force of lightning ahead!</p><p>The Thunder bull’s eyes lit up.</p><p>As a demonic beast, it was born to control thunder and lightning. It was very sensitive to the power of thunder and lightning, far more sensitive than ordinary people.</p><p>“Let’s go, in front!”</p><p>The Thunder bull took the lead and flew in one direction. The direction it was flying in was the mountain peak where Lu Ming was in seclusion.</p><p>Not long after, the lightning bull arrived at the mountain peak where Lu Ming was in seclusion.</p><p>“Young lord Niu, there seems to be someone cultivating in seclusion on this mountain. However, judging from their aura, their cultivation level isn’t very strong!”</p><p>An old man beside him said.</p><p>treasure, a lightning treasure!</p><p>At this moment, the two horns on the Thunder bull’s forehead were flashing with lightning. His eyes were shining.</p><p>He could sense that there were extremely precious lightning treasures in this mountain, and they were very tempting.</p><p>“Blast this mountain open! I want the treasure inside!”</p><p>The lightning bull’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Two burly men bowed and accepted the order. Soon after, a powerful aura erupted from their bodies. It was actually the aura of a great circle spiritual God.</p><p>The two blade lights were as big as mountains. They broke through the sky and slashed towards the mountain.</p><p>The mountain was split open like tofu.</p><p>Lu Ming was in the midst of comprehending the Thundergod strike when he suddenly felt a sense of danger. He opened his eyes and ended his cultivation.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His entire body was wrapped in endless lightning as he rushed out of the rubble. The rubble, regardless of its size, was turned into dust by the lightning on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a bolt of lightning and charged at the two men in the great circle of the spiritual God stage. He activated the Thundergod strike and threw two punches in a row. The lightning in the sky gathered and turned into two lightning phoenixes that pounced at the two men.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
