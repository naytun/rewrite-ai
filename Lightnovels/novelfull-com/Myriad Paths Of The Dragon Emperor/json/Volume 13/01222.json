He stared at Lu Ming and the half-divine medicine in his hand. He wanted to swallow the half-divine medicine.</p><p>The other members of the MU family didn’t look any better.</p><p>His heart ached, his liver ached, and his lungs ached!</p><p>This was originally the MU family’s treasure. However, it had now become someone else’s. It had become Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Among these Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines that had been carefully selected, there was actually still such a treasure contained. If they had known earlier, they absolutely would not have taken it out to sell.</p><p>“Half-Saint medicine!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up as she stared at the half-divine medicine. Her eyes lit up and she began to drool.</p><p>“Give it to me, give it to me!”</p><p>Dandan kept mumbling.</p><p>it would be a waste to give it to you now. Keep it first and plant it in the dark yellow Obsidian soil later. When your vitality is restored, it will be of great value!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan and then carefully put it away.</p><p>Although this half-divine medicine had lost most of its spirituality, Lu Ming had a Supreme treasure like the xuanhuang Ying earth. He might be able to cultivate it again.</p><p>An intact half-Saint herb was worth much more. After all, it had the word ” Saint ” in it.</p><p>“I want to try too!”</p><p>“So many treasures, it’s too shocking!”</p><p>The hearts of the others were burning with passion, and their eyes lit up. Dozens of people went up to choose the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine in succession.</p><p>Dozens of people carefully selected the stones. In the end, each of them chose one stone and paid 100000 raw stones. However, mu Jue and the other members of the MU family still didn’t feel better.</p><p>There were dozens of people, but the total amount was only a few million raw stones. It was incomparable to the treasure that Lu Ming had cut out.</p><p>Lu Ming cut out three treasures, each one more precious than the last. They were worth at least tens of millions.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>A young woman hurriedly cut open the old mine she had chosen, but unfortunately, there was nothing inside. Following that, another person also cut open, but there was still nothing.</p><p>In the end, none of the dozens of people had any treasures. It was empty.</p><p>what’s going on? we’ve chosen dozens of pieces but we can’t cut them. That Lu Ming chose one piece for every piece. The difference is too great!</p><p>Some people sighed.</p><p>“He can’t be able to sense the situation inside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, right? Otherwise, how can you choose one and get one?”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>Many people were shocked when they heard this.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming could choose it three times in a row. This was too shocking.</p><p>If it had only been once, it might have been possible to hit the target twice. Although the probability was very small, it was too small to hit the target three times.</p><p>It was highly possible that Lu Ming could sense the specific situation inside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. His gaze swept across the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s enough!”</p><p>Suddenly, mu Jue opened his mouth and looked at Lu Ming with a cold face.</p><p>“Enough? Young master mu, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>you’ve already cut out three treasures today. It’s time to stop! he said.</p><p>Mujue said coldly.</p><p>“Stop? Hahaha, what a joke. Is this how you do business? If you don’t let me cut it when I’ve managed to get a few more treasures, then why don’t you stop others from cutting it when they haven’t?”</p><p>“Don’t tell me that you can only earn and not lose in business? If that’s the case, then there’s no need for others to do business with your Mu family in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and mocked.</p><p>“You … Nonsense!”</p><p>Mujue shouted angrily.</p><p>“Oh, since I’m talking nonsense, then don’t stop me!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and then strode forward. He grabbed a Divine Ruins ancient mine with one hand and paid a hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>Many people cried out, their eyes burning with passion. Could Lu Ming really sense the treasures in the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine? then, what kind of treasures could he cut out this time?</p><p>Countless people were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Mujue’s face was cold, but he didn’t stop her.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming’s quintessential essence was like a knife as he began to cut open the old mine.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The ancient mine had cracked, but only a layer had cracked. There was still an ancient mine in the divine Ruins inside.</p><p>“Eh? It’s actually a double layer of ore!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little curious. He continued to cut down and very soon, another layer was broken. However, there were still glistening yellow ores below.</p><p>Another level!</p><p>“What’s going on? There are actually three levels. Could it be that this is a useless mine and Lu Ming has finally failed?”</p><p>looks like I’ve failed. It’s impossible to get a treasure every time!</p><p>While some people were discussing, mu Jue and the other members of the MU family heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Dandan, is there really a treasure inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Of course, what kind of existence am I? How could I have sensed it wrong?”</p><p>Dandan stretched out her long head, her face proud.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and continued to cut. However, after breaking through a layer of ore, there was another layer below.</p><p>Lu Ming kept cutting and there were seven layers of ores.</p><p>Everyone was speechless. How could there be so many layers of ore? the other old mines all had one layer, and everything would be cut open. It was rare to see two layers, but now there were seven layers.</p><p>Now, it was only the size of an egg. It was basically impossible for there to be any treasures inside.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was firm as he continued to slice.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The ancient mine cracked open. This time, a red light seeped out from the crack. At the same time, a terrible heat seeped out from the crack, causing the temperature of the entire square to rise sharply.</p><p>However, no one felt the heat. Everyone just looked at Lu Ming in a daze, at the egg-sized Divine Ruins ancient mine in his hand.</p><p>Treasures appeared, and treasures appeared again. Treasures appeared four times in a row.</p><p>Everyone felt numb. They could only instinctively think that another treasure had appeared this time.</p><p>“Damn it, how is this possible? damn it!”</p><p>Mujue roared in his heart and his eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming exerted a little force and the old mine cracked completely. A Crimson stone the size of a longan fruit was revealed.</p><p>A Scarlet light filled the air, and a terrifying heat wave swept in all directions, causing the temperature around the square to rise by thousands of degrees.</p><p>“It’s so hot, it’s too hot!”</p><p>what kind of treasure is this? it’s like a small sun!</p><p>Many people circulated their true essence to resist the terrifying heat.</p><p>“Heavens, this can’t be the divine Sun Stone, right?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>divine Sun Stone. Yes, this is the divine Sun Stone. Legend has it that divine stones can only be produced at the core of the sun. I’ve read about it in ancient books!</p><p>Oh my God, it can’t be. Is this really the divine Sun Stone? ”</p><p>“It’s a Supreme treasure!”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Countless burning eyes were fixed on the divine Sun Stone in front of Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
