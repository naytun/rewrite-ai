The difference was that these carvings were filled with the aura of the concept of fire.</p><p>In front of him, there was also a fiery red light screen blocking his way.</p><p>the martial arts technique of the creation of fire, the fire elemental technique, is on the walls. Only by successfully cultivating the fire elemental technique within half a year can you break through the light curtain and enter the next level!</p><p>That voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind again.</p><p>this time, it’s the martial arts technique of the creation of fire, the fire elemental technique!</p><p>could it be that it is based on the intent realm I have comprehended? I have comprehended five types of intent realm, so do I have to practice five types of intent realm martial arts techniques? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but guess in his heart.</p><p>He looked at the light screen, then walked over, activated the earth Aeon technique, and punched it.</p><p>After the violent fist force hit the light curtain, it did not move at all, not even a ripple could be seen.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming switched to the Thundergod strike, the prison-suppressing heavenly technique, the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, and so on. However, they were all useless. There was not a single ripple on the light screen. As expected, it was useless to try to be opportunistic. He still needed to master the fire elemental technique successfully before he could pass the test.</p><p>Lu Ming did not think too much about it. He started to look at the engravings and started to understand the fire elemental technique.</p><p>With his previous experience, Lu Ming got into the zone very quickly.</p><p>The fire elemental technique was also more powerful than the Thundergod strike, but the difficulty of cultivating it was also terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully comprehended.</p><p>Time passed!</p><p>Two months and 12 days later, Lu Ming’s entire body was bathed in flames, like a god of fire. With a casual strike, the power of the concept of fire exploded to the extreme, unleashing a terrifying power.</p><p>He had successfully cultivated the fire elemental technique!</p><p>I’ve succeeded. I’ve successfully cultivated it again. Hahaha!</p><p>it’s still within three months. This time, it only took two months and 12 days. I’ve saved three days compared to the earth Aeon technique. There’s hope. There’s hope this time!</p><p>“This Lu Ming’s comprehension is too strong. There’s really hope this time!”</p><p>In the hall, Earth One, gold one, and the others cheered in excitement.</p><p>In the past, the fastest person to successfully cultivate a martial technique of creation took three and a half months.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only took two and a half months for the first technique and three days for the second technique. He had surpassed everyone else in the past.</p><p>The shorter the time, the greater the potential. Only then would he have a chance to pass the final trial.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and cast the fire elemental technique. The concept of fire gathered at the tip of his finger and touched the fiery red light screen. The light screen shattered and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and continued to walk forward.</p><p>As Lu Ming had expected, they arrived at another stone room after a short walk.</p><p>There were also carvings on the walls of the stone room, and at the end of the stone room, there was also a light screen.</p><p>This time, he needed to comprehend the martial technique of wind concept, the wind origin technique.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to waste any time. He immediately entered the state and began to comprehend.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had used two days less. He only used two months and ten days to successfully comprehend the wind element technique and passed this stage.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the next stage.</p><p>This time, it was the water elemental technique, a martial technique of the creation of water.</p><p>This time, the time was shortened by two days. He only used two months and eight days to successfully cultivate and pass this stage.</p><p>Then, it was time for the fifth stage. He needed to cultivate the martial technique, Thunder origin technique, of the creation of Thunder.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming, the Thunder origin spell was much easier. This was because Lu Ming had cultivated the Thundergod strike before and had more experience in cultivating martial arts techniques with the concept of Thunder. Hence, it was easier for him to cultivate it.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming only used a total of two months to successfully cultivate the lightning elemental technique and passed this stage.</p><p>“Congratulations, you’ve passed the second stage!”</p><p>When Lu Ming passed through the fifth light screen, a voice rang in his mind.</p><p>From start to finish, Lu Ming used less than a year to pass the second stage and cultivate five powerful martial arts techniques of creation.</p><p>I’ve really made a profit. Even if I don’t get the chaos Scripture this time, I’ve still made a profit!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were glowing.</p><p>These five martial techniques of intent were priceless in the outside world. They were not comparable to techniques of intent like Thundergod strike. Each of them was the best among the martial techniques of intent.</p><p>If Lu Ming could cultivate the five types of martial arts techniques to the highest level, his combat strength would increase dramatically.</p><p>let’s continue. I must get the chaos Scripture!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>It was just a test, but he could obtain five such wonderful martial arts techniques of creation. The chaos Scripture must be extremely amazing. Lu Ming’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>He continued to walk forward. Not long after, the light in front of him brightened up and Lu Ming came to a fighting ring.</p><p>The fighting stage was huge, with a length and width of more than a hundred miles.</p><p>“The battle platform, could it be a test of combat prowess?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring, five figures suddenly condensed in front of him.</p><p>The five figures were all tall and burly men, but their skin colors were different.</p><p>Some were yellow, some were green, some were blue, and some were red …</p><p>It was similar to Earth One whom Lu Ming had seen before. It seemed to be a puppet.</p><p>in the last round, use the earth origin technique, Thunder origin technique, fire origin technique, water origin technique, and wind origin technique to defeat the five puppets. Any other martial techniques will be ineffective!</p><p>“The time limit is two years!”</p><p>A voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>For the last trial, he only had to defeat these five puppets within two years.</p><p>Lu Ming just had a thought.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the five figures pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This figure was khaki-colored and was using the earth origin technique.</p><p>It threw a punch at Lu Ming, and the essence of the earth filled the air. A powerful pressure was exerted on Lu Ming.</p><p>The puppet’s cultivation level was not weaker than Lu Ming’s. With the addition of the earth Aeon technique, it was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The vital essence in Lu Ming’s body exploded and the earth concept spread. He cast the earth Aeon technique and punched his opponent.</p><p>When the two fists met, Lu Ming felt an earth-shattering force surging toward him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Its mastery of the earth Aeon technique is far above mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The khaki-colored puppet stepped onto the fighting stage and charged toward Lu Ming. Its fist force was as heavy as a mountain and as heavy as the earth.</p><p>“Undefeatable!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought. In a situation where they had the same strength, Lu Ming’s mastery of the earth Aeon technique was not as good as his opponent’S. He was not his opponent’s match at all.</p><p>As for other martial skills, they would be ineffective.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body as the nine streams of dragon energy exploded.</p><p>The Dragon power burst forth, and Lu Ming’s strength increased dramatically. He cast the earth Aeon technique and threw a punch.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>This was because the khaki-colored puppet’s strength had also increased rapidly. It was not any weaker than Lu Ming’s dragon power. In addition to the more powerful earth Aeon technique, the other party’s strength still overwhelmed Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
