An ordinary spiritual God would be crushed to death by the seawater, let alone stir it. However, the battle between Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign was actually able to stir up the seawater within a radius of tens of thousands of meters. It was clear how terrifying the two’s combat strength was.</p><p>...</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>“So this is a Supreme Being with a ninth ranked divine bloodline and a 90% divine beast bloodline? His strength is indeed astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming mixed in with the crowd and casually fought with a demonic beast, but his eyes were fixed on the battle between Hai Yu and the Supreme flood Dragon.</p><p>The combat strength of the two people made Lu Ming feel rather solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even if he were to use all his strength now, he would not be a match for Hai Yu or the Supreme flood Dragon.</p><p>The main reason was that his cultivation base was too far away from his opponent’s.</p><p>If his cultivation had broken through to the great circle of the spiritual God stage, he was confident that he would be able to fight with the other party and even suppress him.</p><p>But now, he was still lacking a little.</p><p>From the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm to the great circle of the spiritual God Realm, and from the great circle of the spiritual God Realm to the Supreme realm, the gap between each level was getting bigger and bigger. It was too difficult to cross over.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, it was more than enough to deal with or even suppress those Supreme martial artists who had awakened a sixth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>However, this was only the most ordinary Supreme martial artist. The higher the grade of the bloodline, the stronger the combat power, and the more difficult it would be to deal with.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After watching for a while, Lu Ming had a rough understanding of Hai Yu and the Supreme flood Dragon’s abilities. Then, he killed a sea demon at the great circle of the spiritual God stage and followed the crowd into the space Channel.</p><p>The space spun. In the next moment, Lu Ming felt the pressure around him lighten. The essential core in his body started to circulate rapidly.</p><p>there’s no seawater here, and there’s no pressure from seawater!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first reaction.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>At this moment, he was standing in the void and could clearly see that he was surrounded by seawater. However, it was isolated by a transparent layer, keeping the seawater outside.</p><p>It was the same in all directions, as if there was a restriction that isolated the sea.</p><p>There was a spatial Rift in the sky. It was the spatial passageway. Lu Ming and the rest had come in through the spatial passageway.</p><p>“That is … An ancient city!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sized up the front.</p><p>This area was completely occupied by a vast ancient city.</p><p>In front of them, an ancient city stood tall. It was filled with the aura of the vicissitudes of time, as if it had crossed over from ancient times.</p><p>The ancient city was vast. At a glance, it stretched for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>It was amazing that such an ancient city was hidden more than three hundred thousand meters under the sea.</p><p>At this moment, some people were already flying toward the ancient city.</p><p>Obviously, this ancient city was most likely their ultimate goal. The pure spirit body technique was most likely hidden in this ancient city.</p><p>However, Lu Ming saw a strange scene. When some people flew above the ancient city, it was as if they could not fly suddenly or they were subjected to a great gravitational force. They could not stand in the void. Instead, they quickly descended and landed in the ancient city.</p><p>it seems like we can’t fly in this ancient city!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the space around Lu Ming trembled, and many figures appeared.</p><p>Hai Yu. One of them was Hai Yu.</p><p>The rest were mostly sea demonic beasts, such as the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as the flood Dragon Supreme appeared, he was about to attack Hai Yu. However, Hai Yu was not in the mood to fight. He took a step forward and flew toward the ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate. He used his movement technique and flew toward the ancient city.</p><p>“Kill, kill all these humans!”</p><p>let’s go! sovereign Wyvern ordered, leading the sea demons in pursuit of the ancient city.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived above the ancient city, he felt a strong gravitational force. Even with Lu Ming’s cultivation, he found it difficult to keep flying and could not help but fall.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on a Street in the ancient city.</p><p>Hai Yu and the others landed on another street.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly as soon as he landed on the street.</p><p>At this moment, he felt the prison-suppressing stele bloodline trembling slightly. Lu Ming realized that he could merge with the ground with the help of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the earth essence realm seemed to be restless, as if it could break through at any time.</p><p>this ancient city is 300000 meters below the ocean, which means it’s close to the Earth’s core. When I step on the ground here, I resonate with the earth, allowing me to better understand and touch the earth intent realm!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and deduced the general reason.</p><p>perhaps this is an opportunity for me to break through to the complete stage of level four earth concept!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>If his earth concept broke through to the perfected fourth level, Lu Ming would be able to continue devouring refined origin stones and break through to the perfected spiritual God Realm. Then, the next step would be to comprehend the embryonic form of the territory and break through to the Supreme level.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not far away, there was a roar. It was obvious that there was a battle going on.</p><p>let’s go. Even if there’s a cultivation method for a pure spirit body, it must be in the depths of the ancient city!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He strode forward and rushed toward the depths of the ancient city.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream came from in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Could it be that there are people killing each other?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows and continued to move forward.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>After a while, another shrill scream was heard. The scream was filled with despair and fear, which made people feel cold all over.</p><p>“It doesn’t sound like a scream from a fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he could not help but be careful. He slowed down his pace.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a gust of chilly wind blowing on his body, causing his hair to stand on end.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Dandan suddenly reminded.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming felt a cold aura approaching him from behind. He turned around abruptly and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force pierced through the space and a pitch-black space passageway appeared. However, there was nothing. Lu Ming did not see anything or any living creature.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming felt a cold aura on his neck. It was approaching him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a knife, slashing out horizontally and sweeping in all directions.</p><p>However, when his palm swept over, it was still empty. There was nothing.</p><p>“What the hell is this? Dandan, did you notice?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and looked around carefully, but he still did not find anything.</p><p>I didn’t notice it either. Lu Ming, this place is very strange. It should be the mansion of a powerful existence!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“I don’t need you to say that!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>To be able to bring an ancient city to a depth of 300000 meters under the sea, even an ordinary Emperor couldn’t do it. It was definitely a terrifying existence.</p><p>How could the residence of such an expert be ordinary?</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this time, another scream sounded in front of them. It was extremely mournful.</p><p>who cares what he is? since he doesn’t dare to appear, I’ll continue moving forward!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as the Dragon power in his body burst out. He was ready for a big battle at any time as he stepped forward.</p><p>From time to time, screams could be heard from the ancient city.</p><p>what the hell is this? get out here!</p><p>Someone shouted. He was incomparably frightened, and his face was deathly pale. He crazily attacked in all directions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
