He stared at mu Jue and said,”I will kill you and let you die a miserable death!”</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, are you joking? Today, I’ve mobilized so many experts from the MU family. If you think you can escape, you’ll all die!”</p><p>Mujue laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>Finally, mujue waved his hand and gave the order.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>A series of cold shouts rang out as a terrifying aura burst forth. True energy boiled as a terrifying killing intent enveloped Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Long Chen.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant appeared on Long Chen’s body, and he turned into a giant elephant the size of a mountain.</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant roared and took a step forward. An eighth level spiritual God Realm expert’s expression changed drastically. He let out a blood-curdling scream as his body was torn to pieces.</p><p>With a swing of the elephant trunk, a ninth level spiritual God Realm expert spat out blood and was sent flying in horror.</p><p>Previously, one of their great circle of the spiritual God Realm experts suddenly attacked and gave Long Chen a heavy blow, sending him flying. They thought that Long Chen was only so-so, but they didn’t expect him to be so terrifying when he erupted!</p><p>“Little Qing, help me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, and the nine Dragon bloodline appeared above his head.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons, stepped on the void, and rushed toward mu Jue.</p><p>Mu Jue’s expression changed drastically. He held onto Tuoba Shi and retreated while shouting, ” “Kill him, kill him!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>All of a sudden, five to six experts rushed toward Lu Ming. The weakest of them was at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing also performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a magnificent heavenly demon. She pressed her Jade-like hands together and a powerful heavenly demon force field burst out.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The eighth level spiritual God Realm and even ninth level spiritual God Realm experts ‘expressions changed.</p><p>This was because they were all hindered by the heavenly demon force field, especially those at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, who suffered the most.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>The nine Dragons roared, and the devouring power burst forth, enveloping five or six experts under the devouring power, weakening their combat power once again.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the nine Dragons stepped out.</p><p>“Ah, not good!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>With a series of screams, a few eighth level spiritual God Realm experts were torn to pieces by the claws of the nine Dragons and died on the spot.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two ninth level spiritual God Realm experts were also forced to retreat. They spat out large mouthfuls of blood and their faces were deathly pale.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons let out a long roar and continued to step forward. Their two dragon claws swiped down at the two ninth level spiritual God Realm experts. The power of the prison suppressing heaven technique erupted, and there was no way to avoid it.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The two experts at the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm roared in fear. Then, they each performed their bloodline fusion and erupted with all their strength to resist.</p><p>However, it was useless. Under the nine Dragons ‘dragon claws, his bloodline collapsed. When he turned into a human, he was torn apart by the Dragon claws.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The devouring power erupted and devoured the blood essence energy of the spirit God experts.</p><p>“This, this …”</p><p>Mu Jue and Mu Feng were scared out of their wits as they frantically retreated.</p><p>This was too terrifying and shocking. When Long Chen and Lu Ming erupted, they could kill eighth level spiritual God Realm experts as if they were chickens. Even ninth level spiritual God Realm experts would die.</p><p>They were only at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. How could they be so terrifying?</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A white-haired elder stepped out and struck out with his palm. In his palm, there was boiling lava, which condensed into a meteorite and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Great circle of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>The great circle spirit God Realm expert attacked again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The great circle of the spiritual God Realm was too powerful. Its combat strength was several times stronger than that of a ninth level spiritual God. With a burst of true essence, it shattered Xie nianqing’s sky demon power field.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s delicate body trembled and she retreated. Her face turned pale.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘claws continued to strike the meteorite, producing nine explosive sounds. Lu Ming took a few steps back with each explosion. After nine sounds, he kept retreating, his dragon body trembling.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming was suppressed by a perfected spiritual God.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>On the other side, the Archean dragonesque elephant let out a long howl. Its might was incomparably powerful, and it had killed several experts in succession. Even a ninth level spiritual God expert had died at Long Chen’s hands. However, at this moment, there were also experts at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm who made their moves and suppressed Long Chen.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys retreat quickly. Don’t worry about me!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi roared.</p><p>Given Lu Ming and the rest’s combat abilities, if they were determined to break out of the encirclement, they might be able to do so.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill him immediately if you break out of the encirclement!”</p><p>Mu Jue shouted. He was truly afraid of Lu Ming and Long Chen’s combat strength. If he let go of such powerful figures, he would not be able to live in peace in the future.</p><p>“Don’t even think about using me to threaten them. Even if I die, I won’t die in such a cowardly manner!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi roared in anger. A terrifying wave of energy burst out of his body, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>“You … Crazy …”</p><p>Mu Jue’s expression changed drastically. He shook off Kai ta and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Haha, let’s die together!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi laughed heartily as he charged towards Mu Feng and mu Jue.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Tuoba Shi’s entire body exploded and the violent energy swept towards Mu Feng and mu Jue.</p><p>Self-destruction, tuo BA Shi had self-destructed, not even his bones were left.</p><p>Two figures flew out. They were Mu Feng and mu Jue.</p><p>Mu Feng was in a terrible state. Both of his arms were missing, and half of his body was blown up. His eyes were wide open, and his eyes were filled with unwillingness. However, his life force was quickly dissipating, and even the gods couldn’t save him.</p><p>Mujue’s cultivation was much stronger, so he was much better off. He only spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Young master, are you alright?”</p><p>Two powerful warriors appeared beside mujue.</p><p>I’m fine. Attack and kill them. Let’s attack together and kill them all!</p><p>Mu Jue roared.</p><p>The rest of the powerhouses charged toward Long Chen, Lu Ming, and Xie nianqing.</p><p>There were as many as four people in the great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>The remaining people were all in the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Tuoba!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had calmed down. However, the icy cold killing intent in his eyes was unimaginably dense.</p><p>“Little Qing, you go first into the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. She knew that Lu Ming could only perform better if he was alone.</p><p>With a flash of light, Xie nianqing’s figure was absorbed into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a loud shout, a huge stone tablet appeared.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>The nine Dragons turned into a ray of light and entered the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled, and it grew to a height of 30000 meters, emitting terrifying waves.</p><p>Especially the word ‘stele’ at the bottom, which had a shocking energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed down on a great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The great circle spirit God expert transformed into a huge meteorite. Flames filled the sky as the meteorite crashed toward the prison suppressing stele bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
