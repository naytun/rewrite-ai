This is the ancestral land of the sea demon tribe. The cultivation method of the pure spirit body naturally belongs to us!</p><p>...</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign laughed out loud as he glared at Hai Yu with his cold eyes. His powerful aura had completely locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Hai Yu did the same. He released his aura and stared at the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>In their eyes, their greatest enemy was each other. As for Lu Ming, although he was powerful, he was alone. They did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why don’t you hand over the cultivation method for the pure spirit body? Hurry up and hand it over, and I’ll let bygones be bygones for you hitting my brother!”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted coldly. He was slowly losing his patience.</p><p>“Hehe, you guys really think you can take me down?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you still want to resist? let me tell you, you’re seeking your own death!”</p><p>Hai Yu chided. He did not want to let Lu Ming off, but he was afraid that Lu Ming’s desperate counterattack would give the sea demon tribe an opportunity to attack.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up slightly. Suddenly, he pounced on one of the Supreme-beings from the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence.</p><p>roar …</p><p>As he pounced, the nine streams of dragon energy in Lu Ming’s body burst forth. At the same time, his third bloodline emerged, and a powerful force surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the Supreme-being, and the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele faintly emerged.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Supreme-being was shocked. He did not expect that Lu Ming would suddenly attack him under such circumstances. In a hurry, he retaliated with all his might.</p><p>However, as soon as the two of them exchanged blows, the Supreme-being of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion was shocked and retreated backward, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could easily suppress an ordinary Supreme-being. Moreover, this person was not prepared at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After injuring his opponent with one move, Lu Ming shouted and stepped forward. The nine Dragon bloodline appeared above his head. Lu Ming used the fusion of the bloodlines to transform into Nine Dragons. His dragon claws stepped out and shattered the void.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made the Supreme-being’s heart tremble. He hurriedly cast blood fusion, hoping to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was all in vain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s dragon claws swiped down continuously, breaking apart the other party’s Blood Meridian power. His Blood Meridian body collapsed and he returned to his human form.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon Claw didn’t stop and continued to claw down.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>die! the man roared. The next moment, the Dragon Claw grabbed his dantian. The violent force tore his body apart and even his spiritual spirit was torn into pieces.</p><p>His body and soul were destroyed!</p><p>A Supreme-being had been annihilated in a few moves after Lu Ming’s sudden attack.</p><p>It was so fast that Hai Yu and the others only realized what was going on.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Hai Yu let out an angry roar, and the battleaxe in his hand chopped toward the head of Nine Dragons.</p><p>This axe seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth apart. Its power was astonishing.</p><p>The black and sharp axe energy instantly reached the nine Dragons ‘head.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>“Thunder God strike!”</p><p>A few of the nine Dragons ‘claws unleashed the prison suppressing heavenly art while the other dragon claws used the Thundergod strike. Lightning filled the sky and formed a lightning Phoenix that danced in the air as it pounced toward Hai Yu’s battle-ax.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine dragon claws landed on the battle-ax with a series of loud bangs.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly with each explosion. After nine explosions, Lu Ming was forced to take nine steps back.</p><p>Hai Yu’s combat strength was too strong. He had awakened a ninth level divine level bloodline. Such a person was a peerless genius. He could easily fight opponents of a higher level and was invincible among those of the same level. Moreover, his cultivation was far higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>He had not even performed the blood fusion and he could already force Lu Ming to retreat. It was clear how terrifying his combat strength was!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Hai Yu’s killing intent burst out when he saw that Lu Ming could actually block his attack. With a loud roar, he wielded his battle axe and launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Teng! Teng! “Thump!”</p><p>The nine Dragons soared into the sky, and every inch of their muscles was a weapon. They could use the prison suppressing heavenly art to fight with Hai Yu.</p><p>The terrifying force shattered the ancient city below, and many palaces were turned into ashes.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them exchanged more than ten moves. Although Lu Ming was at a slight disadvantage, he would not lose for the time being.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted and ordered the other Supreme martial artists in the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion.</p><p>At this moment, the flood Dragon sovereign and the others were standing not far away and watching. They did not make a move, which made Hai Yu feel great pressure. He wanted to kill Lu Ming with thunderous means and seize the cultivation method of the pure spirit body, in case any delay would bring trouble.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The other Supreme-beings made their moves as well. Powerful attacks streaked across the void and fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a huge battle-ax appeared above Hai Yu’s head. This was his bloodline, and nine golden chakra glowed with incomparable brilliance.</p><p>Hai Yu turned into a beam of light and seeped into his blood vessels. He performed the blood vessels fusion and turned into a battle axe, slashing at Lu Ming with even more shocking power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The lightning cauldron appeared above Lu Ming’s head. It enlarged rapidly and crashed toward Hai Yu’s battleaxe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Thunder cauldron collided with the battle-ax, and the space rolled like water waves, stirring up thousands of Thunderbolts. It firmly blocked Hai Yu’s battle-ax, and even sent it flying.</p><p>After that, the divine Dragon wagged its tail, and with a sweep of its tail, it destroyed the attacks of several Supreme martial artists.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming let out a long roar and stepped out with his dragon claws. Three gates of sealing suddenly appeared in the sky and enveloped one of the Supreme-beings. He then controlled the lightning cauldron and smashed it down on the Supreme-being.</p><p>The Supreme-being didn’t even have time to scream before he was completely submerged by the lightning cauldron and shattered into pieces.</p><p>Yet another Supreme martial artist had been killed.</p><p>“Ah, damn it! Lu Ming, you must die today!”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted crazily. The Supreme-beings of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion had been killed one after another. He had suffered a great loss. He was going crazy.</p><p>The battle-ax trembled and split the sky and earth as it slashed toward Lu Ming. Its power was terrifying.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to use the lightning cauldron to block and clash with the battleaxe, causing it to shake continuously.</p><p>However, the battle axe was also sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The dragon’s claws stepped in the air. Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. Instead, he charged outward.</p><p>After all, the other party had too many people. Lu Ming planned to leave this place first.</p><p>it’s almost time. Attack! We can’t let this brat escape!</p><p>Not far away, the flood Dragon Supreme, who had been watching the battle, spoke. At the same time, his body transformed rapidly, turning into a black flood Dragon that was a thousand meters long, pouncing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The other sea demons also transformed into their true forms and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With so many Supreme-beings taking action together, a pile of embryonic domains appeared and sealed off the entire area, completely blocking Lu Ming’s path of retreat.</p><p>This was especially so for the flood Dragon Supreme, who was extremely powerful and not weaker than Hai Yu at all. With so many people attacking at the same time, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Hai Yu shouted as well. Together with the flood Dragon sovereign and the others, they attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming exclaimed softly.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>On his shoulder, the bubble cried out. Suddenly, a huge transparent bubble appeared near the flood Dragon sovereign and the others, enveloping the ten sea demon sovereigns within it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
