Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>Under the attack of the lightning Phoenix, the two great circle spiritual God Realm men only let out a blood-curdling screech before their bodies were torn to pieces.</p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p>This was the terrifying power of the martial technique of conception. It dug out the things of the deep level of conception and exerted an extremely shocking power.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had already cultivated the Thundergod strike to the third stage. It was more profound and powerful than the martial arts techniques of creation that the thunderbull and the Ice Dragon had cultivated.</p><p>The fact that he had killed two great circle spiritual God stage experts with one move stunned Lei Niu and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>After being stunned for a moment, the lightning bull saw Lu Ming’s appearance clearly and roared in anger.</p><p>“It’s you? Why? You don’t want the other arm?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly when he saw the lightning bull.</p><p>Anyone who was interrupted during cultivation would not be in a good mood. Right now, Lu Ming was in a very bad mood.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, I’ve been looking for you for days. I didn’t expect you to be hiding here. I’ve really searched high and low for you. Today is the day you die!</p><p>The Thunder bull laughed.</p><p>When he saw the Thunder Phoenix Tree in Lu Ming’s hand, the fiery light in his eyes was almost burning.</p><p>Thunder Phoenix Tree, you actually obtained the Thunder Phoenix Tree. Haha, even the heavens are helping me. Kill him!</p><p>The Thunder bull shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Beside him, there were four other people who were exuding a shocking aura.</p><p>Three of them were at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The other was an elder with a single horn on his forehead. His aura was the most terrifying, and he was a Supreme state expert.</p><p>It turned out that there was a Supreme-being expert following them. No wonder the lightning bull remained calm and composed after seeing Lu Ming easily kill two perfected spiritual God experts. It looked as if it had Lu Ming in the palm of its hand.</p><p>With a Supreme-being present, the lightning bull was extremely confident.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted. His body swayed and he charged at the lightning bull at top speed.</p><p>Since they were already enemies, Lu Ming would strike first.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the process of running, the nine streams of dragon energy in Lu Ming’s body burst out. At the same time, his third bloodline appeared. Lu Ming had borrowed a trace of the power of the third bloodline.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, he could borrow the power of the third bloodline and it was also stronger. His resistance to the endless killing intent was also stronger.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch, and a Phoenix formed from lightning pounced at the lightning bull.</p><p>The endless killing intent and the terrifying power made the lightning bull’s eyes widen in shock.</p><p>“Nine Thunder sword!”</p><p>He used all his strength and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine Thunder sword was destroyed in an instant. The Thunder bull groaned and quickly retreated, its face pale.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to charge at the lightning bull.</p><p>“Junior, you dare!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Four angry roars were heard. The other four people pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>In particular, the elder with the horn on his forehead had a shocking aura. He was terrifyingly powerful and his speed was even faster. In a flash, he appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming and the single-horned elder exchanged a blow and Lu Ming was forced to retreat a hundred meters.</p><p>This person’s strength was even stronger than dark lightning Supreme.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The other three great circle spiritual God powerhouses shouted when they saw Lu Ming being forced back. They wanted to seize the opportunity to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he transformed into Nine Dragons. The devouring power enveloped the three of them and the nine Dragons ‘dragon claws stepped out.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The terrifying power made the three of them scream in fear. However, the next moment, the three of them were pierced by the Dragon Claw and their hearts were crushed.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>The nine Dragons opened their mouths and devoured the blood essence and energy of the three great circle spiritual God Realm experts, turning them into three dried corpses.</p><p>“Kill! Supreme Thunder Rhino, kill him!”</p><p>The Thunder bull roared hysterically.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The single-horned elder, who was also Thunder Rhino Supreme, took out a saber that was flashing with lightning. He slashed the void open and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine dragon claws of the nine Dragons stepped out one after another. A few of them used the prison suppressing heaven art, while the other dragon claws were filled with lightning. They were actually using the Thundergod strike.</p><p>The two terrifying ultimate techniques were used at the same time, and their power was vast.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Supreme Thunder Rhino had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the last exchange of blows, Lu Ming and Supreme Thunder Rhino retreated at the same time.</p><p>Supreme Thunder Rhino’s expression was extremely gloomy. He was a Supreme, but he couldn’t even take down Lu Ming. He felt as if he had lost all his face.</p><p>The lightning bull was shocked as well. Lu Ming’s combat strength was stronger than when he had fought with the bull. He could actually fight against a Supreme-being.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, there was a flash of lightning in the distance. A figure appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Dark lightning Supreme! It was actually dark lightning Supreme!</p><p>This caused the expressions of Thunder bull and Supreme Thunder rhinoceros to change slightly. Why had a Supreme martial artist suddenly appeared at this time?</p><p>“You two, this brat has a grudge against me. Why don’t we join forces and kill this brat?”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder said.</p><p>This caused the eyes of Thunder bull and Supreme Thunder Rhino to light up.</p><p>The Supreme-being who had suddenly arrived was actually Lu Ming’s enemy. The lightning bull was ecstatic.</p><p>hahaha, good. Senior, let’s join forces and kill him!</p><p>The lightning bull laughed and ordered the lightning rhinoceros to join forces with dark lightning Supreme.</p><p>“Guys, this brat has two bloodlines, both of which are extremely terrifying. We’d better attack together and use our full strength to kill him as soon as possible!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder said.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s go all out. Brat, die!”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros let out a loud roar, and his body rapidly expanded, transforming into a single-horned rhinoceros the size of a mountain. His entire body was covered in lightning.</p><p>As for dark lightning Supreme, he used bloodline fusion to form a giant hammer.</p><p>“Since you’ve come to die after escaping, then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. With a single thought, the lightning cauldron appeared and was hurled at the huge hammer.</p><p>At the same time, he himself charged toward the giant hammer that Dark Thunder Supreme had transformed into.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, Supreme Thunder rhinoceros let out a loud cry. He stepped into the void and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Thunder rhinoceros Supreme had 70% of the bloodline of a divine beast. In terms of strength, he was even stronger than Dark Thunder Supreme. A beam of lightning shot out from his single horn, heading straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out and released dandan from the mountain and river diagram. He said,”I’ll leave this single-horned Rhino to you!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Dandan said with confidence.</p><p>Ever since he swallowed the ten thousand spirit crystal in the divine Ruins, he had been digesting it all this time. His strength was increasing and recovering every day, and now, according to him, dealing with a Supreme was no problem.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros roared.</p><p>Dandan retracted her four limbs into the turtle shell, and the turtle shell rolled and hit the lightning beam, blocking it.</p><p>a wild rhinoceros dares to be impudent in front of this Lord. Watch as this Lord Flay your skin!</p><p>Dandan arrogantly shouted as her body rapidly expanded. In the end, she became twice the size of Thunder Rhino Supreme and sent a palm towards him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
