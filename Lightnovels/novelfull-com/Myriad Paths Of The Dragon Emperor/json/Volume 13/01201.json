Within the light, a figure retreated rapidly, blood spurting in the air.</p><p>It was e Kuang. At this moment, his face was pale with horror. One of his arms had disappeared.</p><p>He controlled his physical body and stopped the bleeding. He looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>At the scene, the other Young heaven’s favorites also revealed looks of shock and disbelief.</p><p>One sword. With just one sword, Lu Ming had broken e Kuang’s Blood Meridian fusion and cut off one of e Kuang’s arms. Such combat strength was truly shocking.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was way too terrifying!</p><p>First, there was long Chen. Now, this young man gave off an even more unfathomable feeling.</p><p>Initially, they had thought that the divine wilderness continent had only produced a powerful Paragon like long Chen by chance. The others were still trash. But now, they realized that they were gravely mistaken.</p><p>At first, Lu Ming did not even need to do anything. Long Chen alone had already dealt with the people from the Shen ‘e continent.</p><p>using your own words, everyone will have to pay the price for what he said. An arm is a lesson for you. Get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming put away his third bloodline. The aura on his body became calm again. He looked at e Kuang and said indifferently.</p><p>E Kuang’s face turned ugly, but he didn’t dare to say anything. He turned around and disappeared from the teleportation formation.</p><p>brother, here are five million raw stones to buy your sky Thunder wood!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and walked to the young man selling sky Thunder wood.</p><p>“Good, good, you take the sky Thunder wood!”</p><p>The young man was shocked. He quickly handed the sky lightning wood to Lu Ming and kept Lu Ming’s storage ring.</p><p>Sensing the powerful lightning energy in the sky Thunder wood, Lu Ming smiled and returned to his seat.</p><p>“Little Qing, take a look and see if there’s anything you need. We’ll buy them all!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>en, but I need items that contain demonic aura. They might be rare!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>The exchange of treasures continued.</p><p>However, they did not see the items that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing needed.</p><p>After some time, Lu Ming walked to the middle of the hall and cupped his fists.”Everyone, I’m lu Ming. I need nine-leaf Ganoderma, earth Emperor essence, Emperor Bloodstone … Whoever has these treasures, feel free to name a price. Lu Ming will definitely find a way to get it!”</p><p>Lu Ming listed five types of materials in succession. They were the main materials for refining the Nirvana elixir.</p><p>The Nirvana elixir required a total of the main ingredients. He had already collected two of them, and he still needed five more.</p><p>“These five are all extremely rare spiritual herbs and treasures. I don’t have them on me!”</p><p>“Indeed, I don’t have any either!”</p><p>All the young men in the surroundings shook their heads, indicating that they didn’t.</p><p>After a while, everyone shook their heads. Lu Ming was a little disappointed and returned to his seat.</p><p>“Little Qing, shall we go to the top floor to take a look?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and left the place with Lu Ming. They walked towards the portal.</p><p>This was the sixth floor, and there was another floor above it, the seventh floor.</p><p>After crossing the portal, the two of them appeared on the seventh floor.</p><p>On the seventh floor, there were even fewer people, only about twenty people sitting around.</p><p>As Lu Ming and Xie nianqing attacked, many eyes turned to them.</p><p>However, most of them only glanced at Lu Ming and ignored him. Most of them stopped at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>“I wonder which continent you’re from?”</p><p>“His appearance is no worse than Ji hongchen’s!”</p><p>Murmurs sounded.</p><p>“It’s them, Lu Ming!”</p><p>In the crowd, there was a person with a cold gaze.</p><p>It was Mu Feng. He was also here.</p><p>“Mu Feng, you know them?”</p><p>Beside Mu Feng, there was a handsome young man. He wore a Jade crown and a gold thread shirt. He looked like a noble young master. At this moment, he was looking at Xie nianqing with a burning gaze.</p><p>I know them. They are the divine wilderness continent’s elites. The man’s name is Lu Ming, and the woman’s name is Xie nianqing!</p><p>Mu Feng said.</p><p>“Divine wilderness continent? I’ve heard that Long Chen’s combat strength is pretty good, but what about these two? How is it?”</p><p>The noble young master said.</p><p>“That Lu Ming’s combat ability is slightly stronger than mine. The woman should be average!”</p><p>Mu Feng deliberately said that Lu Ming’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than his.</p><p>yeah, that woman is not bad. I never thought that there would be such a beauty in the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>The noble young master stared at Xie nianqing, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p>“If cousin wants it, why don’t you take it?” Mu Feng suggested.</p><p>hmm, that’s good. After the treasure exchange is over, I’ll send someone to bring this woman to my mansion!</p><p>The noble young master said. His words were filled with great confidence as if the decision he made was the only way things would happen.</p><p>The two of them were using voice transmission so Lu Ming did not hear them. However, he could still feel their gazes.</p><p>“Mu Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he walked over to a table with Xie nianqing. At the same time, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room.</p><p>There were only twenty-odd people on the seventh floor, but all of them were full of energy. They gave off a shocking aura, and it was clear that they were the cream of the crop.</p><p>Among them, the aura of a few people made Lu Ming frown. He felt a sense of danger.</p><p>What caught Lu Ming’s attention the most was a lady sitting at the head of the table.</p><p>She was wearing a fiery red dress that looked like a blooming flower. She was beautiful, but she also had a heroic spirit. She had a strange temperament, but it didn’t stand out on her. Instead, it was very harmonious, forming a different kind of beauty.</p><p>She was indeed beautiful, not inferior to the five great beauties of central continent.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You can’t take your eyes off a beauty, are you tempted?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you jealous?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing teasingly.</p><p>“I don’t have any!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>“How can she be as pretty as you? Why would I be moved!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly, causing Xie nianqing to blush slightly. He gave Lu Ming an expression that said, ” at least you know your place.</p><p>The two of them sat to one side. At this moment, a young man was taking out a treasure and wanted to exchange it with the others.</p><p>It was indeed the seventh level. The treasures were indeed different. It was a piece of golden iron mother. It was very rare and was the best material to refine spirit weapons. Even Lu Ming was tempted. Unfortunately, he did not have what the other party needed.</p><p>Soon, the young man sighed and put it away. Then, his palm glowed, and a glistening yellow stone appeared.</p><p>this is the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine? ”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>That’s right, it’s precisely the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine!</p><p>The young man replied.</p><p>everyone also knows that inside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines, there might be peerless and rare treasures. Right now, I have three pieces in my hands, all obtained from the divine Ruins’ interior. Now, these three pieces, I’ll sell them all. Whoever offers the highest price will get it!</p><p>Two more yellow stones appeared in the young man’s palm. There were three of them in total.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
