He planned to use his blood Meridian fusion to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. He turned around and strode up the stairs.</p><p>Eden, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji were already climbing the stairs with all their might.</p><p>“Zi Wuji, stay!”</p><p>An iron sword appeared in Jian Zhan’s hand. The iron sword crossed the sky, and sword Qi whistled as it slashed toward Zi Wuji.</p><p>Zi Wuji’s entire body emitted a rich purple light. The purple light condensed into a long spear, piercing through the air and fighting against the sword.</p><p>Eden carried the guqin on his back and strode up the stairs. Lu Ming chased after him quickly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stay here!”</p><p>Bing Kong transformed into an Ice River and chased after Lu Ming with a roar. The ice River danced in the air and ice arrows shot out from the ice River, aiming at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He had already let Bing Kong off, but this person was insatiable. He was really courting death.</p><p>Nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. His dragon claws stepped in the air and pounced toward the ice River. The terrifying power kept colliding with the ice River.</p><p>Although the ice River was constantly releasing terrifying killing moves, they were all broken by the nine Dragons. The Dragon claws kept striking the ice River, making the ice River boil and shake.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Bing Kong’s angry roar came from the ice River. He was no match for Lu Ming even if he activated his Blood Meridian.</p><p>sword battle, Zi Wuji, and Eden, let’s join forces and defeat this person first. Otherwise, with this person around, none of us will be able to win first place!</p><p>Bing Kong shouted.</p><p>This made Jian Zhan and Zi Wuji’s eyes flash.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their expectations. He was too strong. Even Bing Kong was suppressed by Lu Ming. They knew their own limitations. They were definitely not Lu Ming’s match in a one-on-one battle.</p><p>If they let Lu Ming climb with all his might, they would not be able to get first place.</p><p>If they dealt with Lu Ming first, it would be hard to tell who would be the first place if only the four of them were left to compete.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the sword battle’s sword gleam changed direction and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Zi Wuji held a long spear and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>They had really joined forces to fight Lu Ming together.</p><p>“So what if we join forces? Then I’ll accompany you in a satisfying battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The blood in his body was boiling.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had used his full strength in a battle between his peers.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons let out a roar as their devouring power burst forth, enveloping Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji. At the same time, the nine Dragons stepped into the air and activated the prison suppressing heavenly art, constantly bombarding them.</p><p>On the stairs, the sound of explosions continued to ring out. The four of them were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>In the sword battle, Zi Wuji performed the fusion of blood meridians one after another, exploding with his strongest combat power to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>For a time, the four of them were actually fighting to a standstill.</p><p>Lu Ming also went all out. He cast the nine seals of the divine Gate from time to time. This secret skill was extremely powerful. Jian Zhan and the others were afraid of it. As soon as they saw the sealing door appear, they tried their best to avoid it.</p><p>Eden stood at the top of the stairs. He didn’t continue to climb. Instead, he stood there and watched the battle below.</p><p>Geniuses had the pride of geniuses. He could have taken the opportunity to climb all the way to the top of the stairs, but it would be meaningless if he did that.</p><p>Even if he won, it would be meaningless because the experts of the four major powers of the yuan continent would all see it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and the three paragons had exchanged more than fifty moves.</p><p>This caused the surrounding people to be dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too shocking. It was as if there was no limit. The stronger his opponent was, the stronger he would be.</p><p>In a situation where his cultivation was lagging behind, he was able to fight against three of the strongest heaven’s favorites. This was too shocking. There were only a few of them since ancient times.</p><p>haha, the bloodline of the nine Dragons is indeed incredible. This man is now a member of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The experts of Dragon God Valley laughed.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. It’s not a must to join Dragon God Valley after awakening the bloodline of the nine Dragons. You can also rise quickly by joining other forces!</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect said unhappily.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect also spoke. Even the experts of the Tianyu demonic sect were tempted by such a person.</p><p>Only the white-haired old man from the heavenly God sect did not speak.</p><p>This was because before the three great forces-Dragon God Valley, Tianyu demon sect, and jiuxiao sword sect-had appeared, he had personally said that he would cancel Lu Ming’s assessment. Now that Lu Ming’s performance was so amazing, it was simply a slap to his face. He could not bring himself to fight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the ones who are ridiculous. Most of the people in Dragon God Valley have awakened the true dragon bloodline. The worst is the flood Dragon bloodline. They are all related to Dragons. They have broken through to the Emperor realm and cultivated the Dragon body. Lu Ming is the most suitable person to join Dragon God Valley. What are you all doing here?”</p><p>The Dragon God Valley expert said unhappily.</p><p>The others did not say anything. It was meaningless to fight for it now. They had to wait for the assessment to end and let Lu Ming make his own decision.</p><p>In the heaven God sect, young master Lin’s face was extremely dark.</p><p>He was the most displeased one.</p><p>On the stairs, the battle continued. The nine Dragons roared and attacked with their claws. The dragon tail swept across. Every inch of his body was a weapon that could unleash the strongest power.</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji became. They realized that they were gradually losing.</p><p>They had never thought that there would be such a powerful heaven’s favorite in the world. Even with the three of them working together, they were still at a disadvantage.</p><p>Before the assessment, they did not take Lu Ming seriously.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming defeated young master Lin, they did not mind too much. With their combat strength, it would not be too difficult for them to defeat young master Lin.</p><p>In their eyes, the only opponents were the strongest geniuses of the four divine palaces.</p><p>Bing Kong, Eden, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji only had one opponent in their eyes.</p><p>They had never expected that Lu Ming, the young man who had suddenly appeared, would be so powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a zither was heard. At the same time, the cry of a Phoenix could be heard.</p><p>A Phoenix bathed in flames flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eden has made his move!”</p><p>Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji’s eyes lit up with joy.</p><p>Eden finally couldn’t help but join the battle.</p><p>Eden finally took out the zither he carried on his back and played the Phoenix divine song. The Phoenix that flew out was much more powerful than the one that had appeared during the battle with tie Hong.</p><p>The claws of the nine Dragons struck the blazing Phoenix and sent it flying. However, the scales on the claws of the nine Dragons were also burned red and almost melted. The temperature of the flames was shockingly high.</p><p>Then, another Phoenix cry was heard.</p><p>A Green Phoenix flew out and worked with the flaming phoenix. The wind boosted the fire and it was even more powerful as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his fighting spirit soaring. He used all his combat strength to fight the four of them.</p><p>Eden’s participation made the battle even more intense. Lu Ming used all his means and killed his way through. The power of the prison suppressing heaven technique grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Suddenly, the sky was filled with lightning. Bolts of lightning as thick as arms shot in all directions.</p><p>Thundergod strike, breakthrough!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
