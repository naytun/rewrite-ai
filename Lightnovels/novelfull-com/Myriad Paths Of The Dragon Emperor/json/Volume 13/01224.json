Xie nianjun has been very close to this man. There are three strongest heaven’s favorites in the younger generation of the South God Palace. This man is one of them, Wang Zhen!</p><p>The monk said.</p><p>“This person is Wang Zhen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The three strongest heaven’s pride experts of the younger generation of the South God Palace were all extraordinary heaven’s pride experts. Each and every one of them was incomparably terrifying, and their cultivation was unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen Ji hongchen before. He was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>He didn’t expect Xie nianjun to be so close to Wang Zhen, one of the three great talents of the South God Palace.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and returned to his room with Xie nianqing and Long Chen.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the room and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>First, he planted the purple Lotus, a half-Saint herb, next to the ancient tree of enlightenment on the xuanhuang silicotic soil. Then, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the top of a mountain with a drop of blood essence in his hand.</p><p>It was precisely the blood essence cut out from the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to devour and refine this drop of blood essence to see if his nine Dragon bloodline could advance to divine level nine.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had refined four Supreme blood essences, but his nine Dragon bloodline had not advanced.</p><p>This time, it was a hope.</p><p>Without any hesitation, the nine Dragon bloodline swallowed the drop of blood essence.</p><p>The drop of blood essence did not collapse immediately after being devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Instead, it turned into wisps of pure energy, which was constantly refined and transformed into the bloodline power of the nine Dragons.</p><p>The energy of this drop of blood essence was extremely majestic and boundless. Lu Ming put all his effort into refining it. In the blink of an eye, almost three days had passed. The energy of this drop of blood essence was finally completely refined.</p><p>On the bodies of the nine Dragons, the eight golden chakra shone so brightly that people could not open their eyes.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above the eight dazzling golden chakras, the ninth golden chakra emerged.</p><p>The ninth golden chakra was a divine level rank 9 bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons had finally advanced to the ninth level of the divine level.</p><p>Moreover, after the ninth golden chakra appeared, it was dark golden at first, but it immediately became bright and resplendent. The color became brighter and brighter, more and more resplendent, and finally, all nine golden chakra were equally resplendent.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons was finally complete.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering Dragon’s Roar rang out in Lu Ming’s mind. At the same time, Lu Ming seemed to see an enormous nine-Dragon with nine dragon claws under its belly soaring and dancing.</p><p>The nine Dragons stepped in the air with shocking power!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was buzzing and exploding. At this moment, many things seemed to have appeared in his mind.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming carefully sensed and comprehended it. He realized that it was a memory, a memory about the nine Dragons.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was only a few fragmented memories.</p><p>“True war Dragon technique Foundation establishment chapter!”</p><p>Lu Ming found the true war Dragon technique’s Foundation establishment chapter in the nine Dragons ‘memory fragments.</p><p>“It’s only the foundation chapter. What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long sigh.</p><p>There should be more chapters to the true war Dragon technique. However, in the fragmented memory fragments of the nine Dragons, Lu Ming only found the foundation building chapter.</p><p>“Also, Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps!”</p><p>Lu Ming had discovered the cultivation method for the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. Unfortunately, he already had it and did not need it at all.</p><p>Other than that, he also discovered a few martial arts techniques. However, they were not as useful as the true war Dragon technique and the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>“My nine Dragon bloodline was awakened by a drop of nine dragon blood essence. Could it be that because it’s only a drop of blood essence, I got intermittent memory fragments? If you want to get more, do you need more nine dragon blood essence?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged for a while and took a closer look. He finally had a new discovery.</p><p>“Is this about the nine Dragon ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered some information and he was in deep thought.</p><p>The location of the ruins of the nine Dragons was actually located at the intersection of the East continent and the central continent, in the chaotic area.</p><p>Back then, it was the nine suns Supreme who had risked his life to enter the nine Dragons ruins and obtained two drops of Nine Dragons Blood essence, the true war Dragon technique, and the cultivation method of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. As a result, he had been seriously injured.</p><p>in the nine Dragon ruins, there might be all the blood essence of the nine Dragons. If I can get all the blood essence of the nine Dragons, I might be able to get all the inheritances of the nine Dragons. It seems that when I am done with the divine Ruins continent and return to the divine wilderness continent, I will have to make a trip to the nine Dragon ruins!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The only thing that made Lu Ming excited was that his nine Dragon bloodline had advanced to divine level nine and had finally produced another dragon energy.</p><p>Nine Dragon powers!</p><p>the ninth dragon energy is so strong!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed for a moment and revealed a look of excitement.</p><p>The ninth dragon power was much stronger than any of the previous Dragon powers.</p><p>if I use the ninth dragon power, I’ll probably be on par with the prison-suppressing stele bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline was a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele’s original body. It was very powerful and was Lu Ming’s strongest killing move. However, Lu Ming felt that if he used the nine dragon energies, it might not be weaker than the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming had one more killing move.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He exited the mountain and river diagram and appeared in his room. Xie nianqing opened the door and walked in.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s time. We have to set off for the ancient Divine Ruins city!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this time, somewhere in the South God Palace, a melodious Bell rang.</p><p>This was the bell that summoned all the geniuses of the continents. At this moment, Long Chen, yang potian, the unscrupulous monk, Ming Zi, and the others all walked out of their rooms and flew towards the source of the bell.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a square where some young experts were already standing.</p><p>These young men were gathered in different areas. They were obviously heaven’s favorites from different continents.</p><p>The number of people varied from seven or eight to an astonishing thirty or forty.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Those who could come here were basically peerless geniuses who had awakened ninth grade divine level bloodlines. There were only twelve of them in the entire divine wilderness continent. However, there were some continents that had as many as thirty to forty people. It was truly shocking.</p><p>The difference in strength between the continents was obvious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. Fifty to sixty young figures flew over.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming saw Wang Zhen, who was dressed in white, and Ji hongchen, who was full of heroic spirit. However, Wang Zhen and Ji hongchen were both half a step behind the purple-haired young man.</p><p>This purple-haired youth was flying at the very front.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw mu Jue in the crowd.</p><p>Mu Jue’s eyes swept across the room. When he saw Lu Ming, his eyes glowed with a cold light.</p><p>The geniuses of the South God Palace had arrived.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
