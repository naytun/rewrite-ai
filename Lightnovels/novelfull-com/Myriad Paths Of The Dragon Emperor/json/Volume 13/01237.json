With a wave of its hand, a chain of lightning flew out and wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. At that moment, Lu Ming had burst out with nine streams of dragon energy.</p><p>This person was one of the three most powerful heaven’s favorites of the Western deity Palace. He was at the same level as the Ice Dragon and had most likely mastered martial arts techniques of creation. Lu Ming naturally would not be careless. Nine dragon energies burst out at once.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As he punched out, the space within dozens of miles exploded and turned into nothingness.</p><p>The lightning chains of the lightning bull also crumbled, and a terrifying fist force continued toward the lightning bull.</p><p>The lightning bull’s expression changed drastically. The power of Lu Ming’s punch was too shocking and far exceeded its expectations.</p><p>“Nine Thunder sword!”</p><p>A huge sword of lightning appeared in the bull’s hand and it slashed down.</p><p>BOOM! The sword of lightning and Lu Ming’s fist force collided. The force spread in all directions and the sky was filled with lightning. Half of the sky was filled with endless lightning, as if the punishment of heaven had descended.</p><p>it’s indeed a martial technique of conception. It’s also a martial technique of Thunder conception, just like the Thundergod strike!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The Thunder bull could use the will of Thunder to a terrifying level. There was nothing else it could do except Thunder martial techniques.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Thunder bull roared and charged at Lu Ming with the Thunder sword in its hand.</p><p>Lu Ming’s power made him want to kill him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the Thunder bull as well, surrounded by the five-colored will. With a wave of his hand, the terrifying power of the prison suppressing heaven technique was unleashed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch at the nine Thunder sword.</p><p>The Land of Lightning was like the might of the heavens, but Lu Ming was not afraid of it. He broke through the might with force and rushed up, crushing the nine Thunder sword.</p><p>The lightning bull’s expression was gloomy. Lu Ming’s cultivation was clearly only at the early stage of the seventh level spiritual God Realm. His cultivation was one level lower than his, but he could actually fight with him. This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>He was an unparalleled prodigy and was invincible among those of the same level. No one had ever been able to fight him with a cultivation level lower than his.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>He roared. Nine colors appeared on the Thunder sword in his hand. The power of the nine different Thunderbolts converged, making it even more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch. On his fist, the faint shadow of a stone tablet could be seen.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven technique and the Thunder battle sword clashed head on, shaking the world.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>A lightning bolt as thick as an arm was struck away, falling on a mountain in the distance. Under the power of the lightning, the thousand-mile-long mountain exploded, turning into broken stones and ashes that scattered everywhere.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A fist force landed on the ground, creating an immeasurably deep hole. Hot lava gushed out from the ground.</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than a dozen moves in a row, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Thunder bull suddenly let out a loud roar. Its body grew rapidly and finally turned into a giant bull the size of a mountain. Its body was covered in lightning.</p><p>The Thunder bull was a demon. This was his true form.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The giant lightning bull stood in the air and its two sharp horns were like heavenly blades.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two sharp horns glowed and two sabers condensed from lightning slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw two punches and sent the two Thunder battle sabers flying. However, his body trembled slightly and he took two steps back.</p><p>The demons were stronger in their true forms.</p><p>“Nine Thunder sword, ten thousand sword kill!”</p><p>Thunder bull! the Thunder bull shouted. The power of Thunder on its body became even more shocking. Endless thunder and lightning filled the air. Some of them were even thicker than a water tank. With the Thunder bull as the center, they shot out and danced in the sky.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Not far away, Xie nianqing’s demonic Qi was spread out to resist the force outside. His face was full of worry.</p><p>who is this person? he actually forced young master Niu to use his strongest combat power!</p><p>In the distance, there were two young men who were shocked by this scene.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>On the body of the Thunder bull, endless lightning gathered and turned into nine-colored combat swords, which were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the power of martial techniques of intent. It could kill everything like a lightning tribulation and destroy all life.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. The dragons soared to the nine Heavens and his nine dragon claws stomped out continuously.</p><p>The sky trembled, and a dense explosion rang out. The Thunder battle swords exploded in the air one after another.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons strode forward and charged at the Thunder bull, clawing at it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The dragon’s claw hit the Thunder bull’s body, but it was blocked. First, it was the Thunder armor. It broke through the Thunder armor and landed on the Thunder bull. It was like hitting a drum. With a bang, the dragon’s claw was bounced off.</p><p>At the same time, the Thunder bull’s horns glowed and a bolt of lightning struck Lu Ming at the speed of light. However, it was blocked by Lu Ming’s heavy defenses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon and a bull fought in the air, as if they had returned to prehistoric times.</p><p>After a dozen moves, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Kid, let’s fight again next time!”</p><p>The more the lightning bull fought, the more shocked it became. It felt that Lu Ming’s strength was endless. Every time he was hit by Lu Ming’s dragon claws, his body would hurt.</p><p>He couldn’t help but want to retreat.</p><p>“You want to leave? did I let you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>“Hmph, brat, you may be strong, but I’m not weak either. You can’t do anything to me!”</p><p>The Thunder bull snorted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. In the next moment, a drop of blood appeared, and a layer of blood-red light appeared on the nine Dragons ‘bodies.</p><p>The third bloodline!</p><p>As soon as the blood light appeared, the power of the nine Dragons suddenly increased. They clawed out and broke the defense of the Thunder bull, leaving a deep claw mark on its body. Blood flowed out.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Thunder bull was shocked and furious. It did not expect that Lu Ming had still held back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Thunder bull roared and wanted to charge out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Each step of the nine Dragons could pierce through the sky.</p><p>The Thunderbolts on the Thunder bull’s body were scattered, leaving wounds on its body. Blood flowed out, and even its bones were exposed.</p><p>The lightning bull roared madly. It felt a chill in its heart. Lu Ming was too powerful and could threaten its life.</p><p>He charged out madly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. His nine dragon claws grabbed one of the Thunder bull’s front legs and tore it apart with all his might.</p><p>With a hiss, one of the Thunder bull’s front legs was torn off by Lu Ming.</p><p>The lightning bull wailed.</p><p>“Thunder escape!”</p><p>He let out a long roar, and streams of blood wrapped around his body. Then, the Thunder bull’s body shrank rapidly, turning into a bolt of lightning. In a flash, it rushed thousands of miles away, and with another flash, it disappeared into the distance.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It was too late to give chase.</p><p>This lightning bull’s life-saving methods were not bad.</p><p>“Young master Niu has lost!”</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The remaining two people screamed in horror and ran for their lives.</p><p>However, there was a flash of light and Lu Ming appeared in front of them.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped them twice. The two of them screamed in pain and retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>“Little Qing, I’ll let you kill these two!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Spare me …”</p><p>The two of them wanted to beg for mercy, but a demonic sword flashed, and their heads flew far away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
