Lu Ming turned around and walked up the stairs, step by step.</p><p>...</p><p>In the void all around, countless people’s eyes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>The scene was silent. Only the melodious sound of Lu Ming’s footsteps could be heard.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu Ming reached the highest point. He stepped on the air and appeared beside Xie nianqing.</p><p>hmm, not bad. It’s worth it for me to admit defeat this time!</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled brightly.</p><p>“Of course. How can your man be bad?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Don’t be so smug!” Xie nianqing blushed.</p><p>“Hahaha, great. You’re really impressive. You have such combat strength and cultivation at such a young age. Even in my Dragon God Valley, you’re considered a pretty good heavenly pride. In our Dragon God Valley, those who have awakened the bloodline of the true dragon and broken through to the Emperor realm have cultivated the Supreme dragon body.”</p><p>The expert from Dragon God Valley laughed as he came to Lu Ming. He looked at Lu Ming with fiery eyes and was full of anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming, although Dragon God Valley cultivates the Dragon body, they are not the only ones who have the cultivation method. Jiuxiao sword sect also has it. Lu Ming, if you want to join jiuxiao sword sect, you can state your conditions!</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect chimed in.</p><p>“What do you mean? Are you going against the Dragon God Valley?”</p><p>The Eyes of the Dragon God Valley expert turned cold as he looked at the jiuxiao sword sect expert unhappily.</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect sneered fearlessly.</p><p>The expert from the Tian Yu demonic sect wanted to say something, but Lu Ming had nothing to do with the demonic Dao. He figured that there was little hope of inviting Lu Ming. After some thought, he turned to Xie nianqing and said, miss, your talent in the demonic path is extremely pure, and my Tian Yu demonic sect mainly cultivates the demonic path. How about I invite you to join my Tian Yu demonic sect? ”</p><p>“The Tian Yu demon sect?”</p><p>Xie nianqing was tempted, but he shook his head after looking at Lu Ming.”Thank you, senior. I’ll follow Lu Ming. I’ll join whichever sect he joins.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>Xie nianqing would follow Lu Ming wherever he went?</p><p>“Little Qing …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing and his heart warmed.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The expert from the Tian Yu demonic sect wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, just join the Dragon God Valley. Only the Dragon God Valley can bring out your full potential!</p><p>The expert from Dragon God Valley said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>At this moment, the expert from the Tian Yu demon sect spoke, ” Lu Ming, you’ll join Dragon God Valley, and this lady will join my Tianyu demon sect. Dragon God Valley and Tianyu demon sect are very close to each other, so you can visit each other often. This way, you can meet each other often, and it won’t affect your cultivation.</p><p>“To be honest, if this girl doesn’t join a demonic sect, her talent will be wasted!”</p><p>The expert from the Tian Yu demonic sect persuaded.</p><p>But Xie nianqing still shook his head.</p><p>seniors, if we join your sect, can we delay our journey to the yuan continent for a while? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>The experts from Dragon God Valley, Tianyu demonic sect, and jiuxiao sword sect all nodded.</p><p>“Since it’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing. Xiaoqing, why don’t you join the Tianyu demonic sect? I’ll join the Dragon God Valley. We can meet often anyway!</p><p>The powerhouse from the Tianyu demonic sect was right. If Xie nianqing followed him and joined the Dragon God Valley or other forces, it would only be a waste of talent. After all, cultivation was the most important thing for Warriors.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t need to go there immediately. He could go there after a while.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, the eyes of the experts from the Dragon God Valley and the Tian Yu demon sect lit up.</p><p>Xie nianqing pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, ” “Alright then!”</p><p>senior, I’m willing to join Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said to the expert from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Good, good, haha!”</p><p>The experts of Dragon God Valley were overjoyed.</p><p>Xie nianqing also expressed his desire to join the Tian Yu demon sect, and the experts of the Tian Yu demon sect were also overjoyed.</p><p>Although Xie nianqing’s cultivation level was still low, his potential was limitless.</p><p>Both Dragon God Valley and the Tian Yu demon sect were overjoyed. They had each gained a rare genius.</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect shook his head and sighed. The white-haired elder from the heavenly God sect looked gloomy and did not say anything.</p><p>The others were envious.</p><p>Other people could not join a sect even if they wanted to. However, Lu Ming had been invited by several sects and forces. The treatment was incomparable.</p><p>Following that, Dragon God Valley, jiuxiao sword sect, and tianshen sect began to fight for Dragon Chen.</p><p>After all, Long Chen’s awakened immemorial Dragon elephant bloodline also had endless potential.</p><p>In the end, Long Chen also chose Dragon God Valley, which made the leader of Dragon God Valley laugh his head off.</p><p>“Bing Kong, how about you join my Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>“Jian Zhan, how about you join jiuxiao sword sect?”</p><p>……</p><p>Then, the four forces started to send out invitations to Eden, ice sky, sword battle, and Zi Wuji.</p><p>In the end, Bing Kong joined the Tian Shen sect, Jian Zhan joined the jiuxiao sword sect, Zi Wuji joined the Tian Shen sect, and so did Eden.</p><p>The cultivation techniques of the heaven God sect were more diverse and suitable for most of the heaven’s favorites to join.</p><p>The white-haired old man of the heavenly God sect finally revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>“Xie nianjun, what do you think about joining my Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>At this moment, the tianshen sect sent an invitation to Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun was overjoyed. He nodded without hesitation.</p><p>After that, geniuses like Ji hongchen and Wang Zhen were also invited to join the four great sects.</p><p>The remaining paragons looked at the four sects with eager eyes, hoping to be invited.</p><p>“Your name is yang potian, right? How about you join the jiuxiao sword sect?”</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect’s expert looked at yang potian, causing his body to tremble violently. His eyes revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>He didn’t expect to be invited, so he quickly nodded in agreement.</p><p>even though his cultivation is low, he has comprehended the will of space. No wonder he was chosen by the jiuxiao sword sect!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Time and space were the Kings. The space mentality was rare and powerful, and there were very few people who could comprehend it. Yang potian’s cultivation was still low, and he did not have any cultivation methods related to the space mentality. There were many mysteries that he had not developed yet.</p><p>If he went to a major sect in the yuanlu continent, he would be very terrifying when he fully developed the space concept.</p><p>Oh my God, this way, there are five people from the divine wilderness continent who have been selected to join a large sect in the yuan continent!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Everyone thought in their hearts, as expected.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Long Chen, Xie nianjun, and yang potian.</p><p>A total of five people had joined the major sects of the yuan continent. The number of people had even surpassed that of the blood Sun continent, which was ranked second.</p><p>This made the other young geniuses extremely envious and jealous.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorites looked at the powerhouses from the four forces with hope, hoping that they would be chosen.</p><p>Unfortunately, the experts from the four forces did not make any moves after that. They glanced at the many heaven’s favorites and frowned, as if they were thinking.</p><p>In the end, three more people were chosen. They were all heaven’s favorites with low cultivation but good potential.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
