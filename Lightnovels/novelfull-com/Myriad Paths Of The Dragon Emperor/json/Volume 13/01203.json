I’ll use other treasures or raw gemstones to buy it from you. State your price!”</p><p>...</p><p>Mu Jue stood up, his eyes fixed on the fire spiritual root in pang Yuan’s hand.</p><p>no, a fire spirit root is also very useful to me, but I need the sword-shaped stone more. If there is a sword-shaped stone, I will exchange for it. If there is none, then forget it!</p><p>Pang Yuan said.</p><p>“Pang Yuan, the fire spirit root is very useful to me. Can’t we discuss it?”</p><p>Mujue still didn’t give up, and his eyes were burning.</p><p>“What does it have to do with me if it’s of great use to you?”</p><p>Pang Yuan sneered.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mujue’s face turned ugly.</p><p>However, pang Yuan was also a very famous heaven’s favorite of the South God Palace. The force behind him was also very strong, not any weaker than mu Jue. Therefore, mu Jue was extremely wary of pang Yuan.</p><p>If it was someone else, he would have attacked.</p><p>“Who has a sword shaped stone? If you don’t, then forget it!”</p><p>Pang Yuan said.</p><p>“I have it!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone could not help but look over.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Many people were stunned. It was Lu Ming who had just spoken.</p><p>“You have a sword-shaped stone?”</p><p>Pang Yuan’s eyes lit up as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up. His palm glowed and a small stone sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>The stone sword was the size of a palm and milky white in color. It emitted a faint sword Qi.</p><p>This was the sword-shaped stone!</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he was lucky. He had found this sword-shaped stone when he was sorting through the storage rings of the expert from the heaven martial sword sect after Xie Luan had killed him.</p><p>Back then, Xie Luan had killed so many powerful people and Lu Ming had obtained many good things. He had organized them all.</p><p>Now, it had come in handy.</p><p>“It really is a sword-shaped stone!”</p><p>Pang Yuan’s eyes lit up as he looked at the stone sword in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>The sword-shaped stone was extremely useful for Warriors who cultivated the sword.</p><p>“This sword-shaped stone should be enough to pay you back for your fire spirit root!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course you can!” Pang Yuan said with a smile.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, mu Jue said coldly. He took a step forward and stood not far from Lu Ming. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Kid, sell me your sword-shaped stone!”</p><p>“Sell it to you? I’m sorry, my sword-shaped stone needs to be exchanged for a fire spirit root with that brother pang, so I don’t have any extra sword-shaped stones!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>there’s nothing else. Just sell the one in your hand to me. Hurry up, I don’t have time to waste on you. Name your price!</p><p>Mujue said impatiently.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. don’t you understand what I’m saying? I’ve already said that I have use for this sword-shaped stone!</p><p>“Nonsense, I don’t care if you’re useful or not. Now, sell him to me, you hear me?”</p><p>Mujue scolded coldly.</p><p>“Hehe! Where did this idiot come from?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This mu Jue obviously wanted to use his sword-shaped stone to exchange for the fire spiritual root with pang Yuan.</p><p>He didn’t dare to do anything to pang Yuan? Yet, he was bullying him.</p><p>At the side, the others looked on indifferently and did not say anything.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? Do you know who I am? I am mu Jue, the young master of the MU family, one of the top ten families in the South God Palace. You dare …”</p><p>“Get lost. I don’t care who you are. Who you are is none of my business, a good dog doesn’t block the way!”</p><p>Before mu Jue could finish his words, he was coldly reprimanded by Lu Ming and he swallowed his words.</p><p>courting death. How dare a piece of trash from the divine wilderness continent act so arrogantly. If I don’t teach you a lesson today, you really don’t know how high the heavens are!</p><p>Mujue’s face turned gloomy. His eyes were cold, and the aura around him became violent.</p><p>A layer of flames spread out from his body.</p><p>At the side, the others looked on quietly, and no one stopped them.</p><p>In this world, treasures could only be obtained and protected if one had the strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Mu Jue waved his hand and a long whip condensed from flames whipped toward Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>“You really think I’m a soft persimmon!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. His palm was like a knife and he slashed out.</p><p>With a poof, mu Jue’s flame whip was cut into two.</p><p>“You have some skills, but you are still too young to be arrogant in front of me, mujue!”</p><p>Mujue said coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on his body became even more violent, and a terrifying pressure bloomed in the hall.</p><p>The strength of this pressure surpassed the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The sixth level of the spiritual God Realm. Moreover, it was the peak of the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Mu Jue’s cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm, which was one level higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Is this the strength of the geniuses of the South God Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was indeed the most powerful continent in the divine Ruins continent group, with experts as numerous as the clouds.</p><p>The South God Palace could be considered one of the four strongest forces in the divine Ruins continent, and the geniuses among them were naturally not to be underestimated.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, a Paragon like long Chen was only at the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The other geniuses, such as Xie nianjun and dark Child, had just broken through to the fourth level spiritual God Realm not long ago. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Mu Jue shouted coldly and struck out with his palm. A huge palm print condensed and blasted toward Lu Ming. He wanted to suppress Lu Ming with one palm and make him kneel on the ground.</p><p>“Sixth level spiritual God Realm, so what?”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. The Dragon power in his body burst out and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying fist force hit the flaming hand and directly penetrated it.</p><p>“Eh? Again …”</p><p>Mu Jue’s eyes turned even colder when he saw that the palm that he had condensed was destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“F * ck you, it’s my turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the ground trembled. Countless inscriptions appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure neared mu Jue in an instant. At the same time, the third bloodline appeared above his head. A wisp of energy surged into his body, causing him to be covered in a bloody light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After borrowing the power of the third bloodline, Lu Ming’s strength increased again and he threw a punch at mu Jue.</p><p>A cold killing intent enveloped mujue, and a terrifying force pressed toward him.</p><p>This made mu Jue’s expression change slightly. He roared and the flames were boiling. He threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the two fists collided, mu Jue’s expression changed drastically. He took a few steps back while Lu Ming’s body only swayed a little.</p><p>“What? Mujue has been pushed back!”</p><p>“How is that possible? Mujue is at the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm, but he was forced to retreat. What happened?”</p><p>that Lu Ming’s cultivation is only at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. How did this happen? ”</p><p>After mu Jue was knocked back with a single punch, the scene went into an uproar. Many people cried out in shock.</p><p>Among them, a few young men’s eyes flickered and revealed a strange light.</p><p>For example, the beautiful woman in the fiery red long Fist had a look of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>“Damn it, brat, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>After being punched by Lu Ming, mujue let out a long and angry howl.</p><p>He had a higher cultivation level, but now, he was forced to retreat by a young man with a lower cultivation level. This made him feel extremely humiliated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
