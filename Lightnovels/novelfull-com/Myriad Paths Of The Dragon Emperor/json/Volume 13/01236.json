It cut through the opponent’s attack and layers of defense, cutting off the opponent’s brow.</p><p>There were no injuries, but the man’s eyes suddenly widened, revealing an expression of shock. But the next moment, his eyes lost focus and his body fell down.</p><p>He was dead! This person was killed by Xie nianqing with one strike!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After killing this person, Xie nianqing controlled the demonic sword and slashed horizontally across another person’s body.</p><p>There was still no wound, but the man screamed and his body trembled. He retreated madly, his aura dispirited as if he had been seriously injured.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered. Then, her body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood. Her face was pale.</p><p>Clearly, that move just now had also caused a great burden on her.</p><p>“This … How could that be?”</p><p>The two people beside the young man with a pair of nose rings were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Destroying a God’s soul, what a powerful technique!”</p><p>The young man with the round nose ring had a serious expression on his face, but the light in his eyes was even more intense.</p><p>“You, get lost, you useless thing!”</p><p>The young man with a nose ring stepped forward and glanced at the injured young man. He scolded him coldly.</p><p>The young man gritted his teeth, but he did not dare to refute.</p><p>This young man with a nose ring was one of the three most powerful heaven’s favorites of the Western deity Palace. He was extremely powerful and cruel, so he didn’t dare to argue with him.</p><p>“Little girl, just surrender. Although you have some skills, in front of me, you have no power to resist!”</p><p>The young man with a round nose ring walked towards Xie nianqing step by step. His aura was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>The eighth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed with determination. This young man with a nose ring gave her immense pressure, but it was impossible for her to surrender.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body moved and retreated like a ray of demonic light.</p><p>“You can’t escape from me!”</p><p>The young man with a ring on his nose didn’t panic. With a flash of lightning, his body seemed to have turned into a bolt of lightning. He cut through the void and approached Xie nianqing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At the same time, the young man with the round nose ring waved his hand and a chain made of lightning shot towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and activated the sky demon power field. At the same time, he used his bloodline fusion to increase the power of the sky demon power field to the maximum.</p><p>the chains of lightning suddenly began to slow down in the field.</p><p>what a wonderful force field. It has a trace of the power of a domain. Unfortunately, your cultivation base is too weak!</p><p>The young man’s eyes turned cold. Lightning flashed all over his body. The lightning chain broke the sky demon force field in half and quickly wrapped around Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Great demonic palm!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s heavenly demon bloodline sent out a few palm prints in a row, but they exploded after being hit by the lightning chains.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned even paler and he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, you don’t have the power to resist me!”</p><p>The young man with a nose ring said coldly with an arrogant expression.</p><p>“God-destroying Demon Sword!”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted her teeth. Ignoring her injuries, she unleashed the God-destroying Demon Sword with all her might. Her glabella glowed, and a black sword light cut through the void, slashing toward the young man with the round nose rings.</p><p>In the face of this sword, the young man with the nose in a ring had a slightly serious expression on his face, and the power of lightning on his body intensified.</p><p>“Nine Thunder sword!”</p><p>The young man with the nose ring slashed his palm down. A sword with lightning struck out and clashed with Xie nianqing’s demonic sword.</p><p>With a bang, the nine Thunder sword emitted a blazing light, hoping to block the demonic sword. However, in the end, it only blocked a part of it. The remaining part continued to slash towards the young man with the nose ring.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The young man with the nose ring was covered in lightning, forming a lightning armor that blocked the demonic sword.</p><p>In the end, the demonic sword was weakened layer by layer, and only a trace of it entered the young man’s body. The young man’s body trembled as if he had been struck by lightning, and he took a step back.</p><p>“Dammit! How dare you hurt my soul!”</p><p>The man with the nose ring growled, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body trembled as she retreated and spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Little girl, I didn’t want to hurt you, but you asked for it!”</p><p>The young man with a ring on his nose shouted coldly. His body was surrounded by lightning as he took a few steps forward and approached Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sighed in his heart. Then, his eyes revealed a trace of ruthlessness.</p><p>Even if she were to die, she would not let herself fall into the hands of the young man with a nose ring.</p><p>“Ah? What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man looked into the distance and exclaimed.</p><p>The young man with a pair of nose rings and Xie nianqing looked over subconsciously.</p><p>He saw a blood-red light pillar moving at a terrifying speed in that direction. It was as if a blood-red Stick had cut through the void.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sound of the space being shattered could be heard. They saw a young man flying towards them at a terrifying speed. He was so fast that he even shattered the space.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed.</p><p>The person was Lu Ming!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A young man stepped forward and blocked Lu Ming’s way.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>The terrifying fist force enveloped the young man’s body with an unstoppable force.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The young man’s pupils dilated. The next moment, he screamed and his body exploded in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared beside Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re injured!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached when he saw Xie nianqing’s pale face and the blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>However, he also heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that Xie nianqing was fine.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m fine!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s smile was so beautiful that the young man with a pair of nose rings was stunned.</p><p>“Little Qing, don’t worry. I will avenge you!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and wiped the blood from the corner of Xie nianqing’s mouth.</p><p>Seeing the intimate expressions on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s faces, the young man with the nose ring had a look of jealousy in his eyes. He shouted coldly, ” “Brat, you dare to kill my people and stand beside my woman. You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Your woman?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He looked at the young man with the nose ring and said,”I’ll definitely kill you just because of what you said!”</p><p>“Hahaha, kill me? kid, with your abilities?”</p><p>The young man laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful. This man is one of the three strongest heaven’s favorites of the Western deity Palace, Lei Niu!”</p><p>Xie nianqing whispered.</p><p>“Don’t worry, he’ll become a dead bull very soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He stepped forward and charged at the Thunderbolt bull.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
