He activated Thundergod strike and punched out. A Phoenix formed by lightning flew towards young master Lin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning Phoenix Feathers collided with the palm print.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>young master Lin revealed a vicious expression.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>the moment they clashed, young master Lin’s Green palm print exploded. Within the palm print, 100 terrifying powers exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lightning Phoenix was destroyed in an instant.</p><p>The palm print continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die, trash!” young master Lin hollered in his heart.</p><p>what a wonderful martial technique of creation!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Young master Lin’s martial arts technique of creation was clearly a low-grade divine martial arts technique. He had only cultivated it to the third level. However, the explosive power was extremely shocking.</p><p>It could only be said that the other party’s martial technique of intent was of high quality, even more profound than Thundergod strike.</p><p>Thinking about it, it made sense. Young master Lin was an official disciple of the heaven deity sect and Lu Ming’s Thundergod strike was only learned in the first round of the assessment. Naturally, it could not be as exquisite as young master Lin’s.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a series of intense explosions, Lu Ming’s punch directly broke through young master Lin’s 100-fold force.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and threw another punch.</p><p>This punch was direct, but its power was shocking.</p><p>young master Lin slapped a few times to counter Lu Ming. But after a few explosions, young master Lin was forced to retreat.</p><p>This left everyone dumbfounded!</p><p>A disciple from the tianshen sect, a major sect in the yuanlu continent, was actually no match for Lu Ming?</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he came from a mere divine wilderness continent. How could he be so strong? So shocking?</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>everyone’s gazes made young master Lin go crazy. His killing intent was really thick.</p><p>He was a disciple of the tianshen sect, just like the high and mighty Prince of the mortal world who lived in the Imperial City. On the other hand, Lu Ming was from a poor and remote village. He could not be compared to him.</p><p>But now, he was being suppressed.</p><p>How could he endure this? He roared in his heart and circulated his essential core crazily. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“Is this the combat strength of the heaven’s God sect’s Paragon? In my opinion, you’re not a big deal in the Tian Shen sect. Otherwise, how could he be so weak?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The yuan continent was the core of the yuan realm and the Holy Land of cultivators. Many emperors tried their best to join the major forces of the yuan continent.</p><p>The tianshen sect was a big sect in the yuan continent. If young master Lin was truly the heaven’s pride of the tianshen sect, he couldn’t be so weak.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that young master Lin’s status in the deity sect was very ordinary.</p><p>“Trash, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words seemed to have hurt young master Lin, causing him to scream hysterically and lose his sense of propriety.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming was right.</p><p>In the heavenly God sect, there were countless heaven’s pride experts. People like him were the lowest level of existence in the heavenly God sect. He had to bow and kneel every day and look at other people’s faces.</p><p>That was why he took the opportunity to come to the divine Ruins continent. He thought that he could show off and enjoy himself in the divine Ruins continent. He did not expect that he would be suppressed by a piece of trash and mocked like this.</p><p>He was completely enraged.</p><p>With a screech, a green Divine Eagle appeared above young master Lin’s head. Without a doubt, it had a ninth level divine bloodline, and it was covered in a green light.</p><p>Young master Lin turned into a Divine Eagle and was about to use his strongest killing move to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this moment, a dignified voice sounded, and a middle-aged man appeared in the sky.</p><p>This man was also an emissary of the heavenly God sect. He had been following behind the white-haired elder.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he blocked in front of young master Lin.</p><p>“No, a piece of trash dares to insult me. He is not putting the Tian Shen sect in his eyes. I will kill him!”</p><p>young master Lin shouted.</p><p>“Enough, haven’t you embarrassed yourself enough? The deacon asked me to bring you back!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>When he heard the word ‘Deacon’, young master Lin shivered. He seemed to be very afraid. He looked around and gritted his teeth. He transformed into his human form and stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll spare you today, but this matter isn’t over yet!”</p><p>after saying that coldly, young master Lin turned and left.</p><p>The middle-aged man cast a casual glance at Lu Ming. No one knew what he was thinking, but he turned around and left the place.</p><p>The battle had ended just like that. The surrounding spectators felt that it was a pity.</p><p>this Lu Ming has offended young master Lin. He’s probably not going to have a good life!</p><p>“I don’t think it’ll be easy for him to be chosen by the tianshen sect!”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve implicated you. I’m afraid that you won’t be able to enter the tianshen sect because of this!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>fool, if you can’t enter, then you can’t. At most, we’ll go to the yuan continent and find a sect to join!</p><p>Lu Ming tapped Xie nianqing’s nose and smiled.</p><p>The two of them returned to their residence.</p><p>After half a day, the second round of the selection of the Tian Shen sect would begin.</p><p>More than five hundred geniuses from the four divine palaces who had survived gathered around the Phecda peak.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why didn’t the thunderbull come?”</p><p>On the side of the Western deity Palace, the elder leading the team frowned.</p><p>Lei Niu was one of the three most powerful heaven’s favorites of the Western deity Palace. Although one of his arms was cut off by someone last time, his combat strength was still very strong. There was still a possibility that he would be chosen by the heavenly deity sect. The Western deity Palace still had great hopes for Lei Niu.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Thunder bull was nowhere to be seen, which gave the elder a bad feeling.</p><p>I heard that the lightning bull seems to have gone to the lightning territory to cultivate and recover!</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>“Could it be that he met with an accident in the lightning territory?”</p><p>I heard that he’s bringing experts with him, and there’s even a Supreme-being expert among them!</p><p>The paragons of the Western deity Palace discussed in low voices.</p><p>However, as time passed, the figure of the lightning bull still did not appear. Many people knew that something had most likely happened to the lightning bull.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to not show up now. This was the selection of disciples by the divine realm sect. How big of a matter was this?</p><p>Six figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>The people of the heavenly God sect had arrived.</p><p>The one in the lead was still the white-haired old man, followed by two burly men, and behind them were three young men. Young master Lin was one of them.</p><p>His gaze swept across the room and landed on Lu Ming. A cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Brat, you want to join the heaven deity sect? in your dreams. After this selection, I will find an opportunity to kill this person!”</p><p>young master Lin smiled coldly.</p><p>alright, the second set of arrangements has been completed!</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect waved his hand and countless inscriptions appeared in the sky. Then, light doors appeared in the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
