It was close to Hai Yu’s and the flood Dragon sovereign’s strength. However, even with such a combat strength, he was still in a miserable state.</p><p>The black-robed old man was shouting, rolling in the air and attacking randomly.</p><p>Then, to everyone’s horror, the black-robed elder’s body was shriveling, as if his life force was slowly disappearing.</p><p>At the same time, a black shadow appeared around the black-robed old man’s body. It was twisted and ferocious.</p><p>It was that kind of resentment!</p><p>“It’s that damn thing again. Why is this Dao so strong?”</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Someone’s voice trembled.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The black shadow let out an ear-piercing scream and suddenly drilled into the black-robed elder’s body. The black-robed elder let out a shrill scream and then stopped struggling. His life force had completely disappeared.</p><p>His eyes were wide open with shock, disbelief, and unwillingness.</p><p>He had tried his best and spent decades, but he still couldn’t find the cultivation method of the pure spirit body. In the end, he made up his mind and made hundreds of copies of the map, hoping to find the cultivation method of the pure spirit body with the help of others.</p><p>He was about to reach the last step. The cultivation method of the pure spirit body was about to fall into his hands. His decades-long wish was about to be fulfilled. How could he be willing to die Here?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After the black-robed old man died, the distorted black shadow reappeared and looked at Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others with a ferocious expression, causing everyone to feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p>this kind of thing is afraid of the early stage of the domain. I suggest that we work together to destroy this damn thing first, and then we will fight for the Jade card with our own abilities. What do you think? ”</p><p>Hai Yu suggested as he looked at the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>The only thing he was afraid of here was the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll join hands with you guys first!”</p><p>Said Paragon flood Dragon.</p><p>That resentment was something that even the flood Dragon sovereign was afraid of.</p><p>“What about you guys?”</p><p>Hai Yu looked at the other Supreme-beings.</p><p>“I’m willing!”</p><p>“I’m naturally willing!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artists all nodded.</p><p>alright, then let’s join forces and cast the embryonic form of our domain to seal and destroy this damn thing. Let’s do it!</p><p>attack! Hai Yu shouted. He struck out with his palm, and the embryonic form of his domain spread out at a speed visible to the naked eye, spreading toward the black shadow.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The black shadow seemed to be afraid of the domain. It squeaked and its body kept shaking, trying to Dodge.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other Supreme-beings, including the Supreme-being of the sea demon clan, also made their moves. One after another, embryonic domains spread out toward the black shadow.</p><p>There were more than 30 Supreme-beings present. They attacked together and formed their domains, sealing off the entire area.</p><p>The black figure couldn’t avoid it and was enveloped by the layers of domains.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>The black shadow screamed as if it had fallen into a quagmire and could not move.</p><p>“Obliterate!”</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>More than thirty Supreme-beings roared and controlled their domains. They exploded with destructive power, trying to destroy the black shadow.</p><p>The black shadow kept on twisting and screaming as it struggled with all its might. However, it was useless. It was trapped by layers of domains. Under the destructive power, its body slowly shrank and was slowly destroyed.</p><p>As time passed, the black shadow became smaller and smaller.</p><p>After a long time, there was a sudden bang and the black shadow collapsed, turning into nothing.</p><p>The black shadow was finally destroyed by the joint efforts of dozens of Supreme martial artists.</p><p>This time, many greedy eyes were fixed on the Jade plate.</p><p>The black shadow was destroyed, and everyone’s eyes naturally gathered on the Jade token.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>Just as everyone was about to make a move, another ear-piercing sound rang out.</p><p>Moreover, this time, it was not just one or two streaks, but an entire stretch.</p><p>The screeches gathered together and came from all directions.</p><p>Then, to everyone’s horror, black shadows flew out from the surrounding halls. They were exactly the same as the one before.</p><p>At the same time, black shadows flew out of the palaces they passed behind them.</p><p>Countless black shadows shrieked and twisted, looking ferocious and terrifying. Like a black storm, they swept towards the crowd.</p><p>At this moment, the faces of Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others turned deathly pale.</p><p>“Save … Help, big brother, help!”</p><p>Hai Tian, in particular, shrieked in fear. His entire body trembled, and a foul smell came from his pants. It turned out that he had peed himself.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>Hai Yu let out a roar, pulled the sea and the sky, and launched a crazy attack.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The others also rushed out.</p><p>At this moment, no one was thinking about the cultivation method of the pure spirit body. They only had one thing in their minds, and that was to rush out and save their lives.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Everyone unleashed all sorts of attacks, but it was useless. Ordinary attacks were completely useless against those black shadows.</p><p>Only a sovereign’s domain could be effective.</p><p>???!</p><p>Screams rang out. Many high-level spiritual God experts were entangled by the black shadow and suffered terrible attacks. Some people screamed and were killed by the black shadow.</p><p>The sovereigns used their domains to protect their bodies and kept charging out. Many smart spiritual God experts followed closely behind the sovereigns and charged with all their might.</p><p>Countless black shadows charged towards the crowd.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly turned around and dashed toward the Jade card.</p><p>He activated the prison-suppressing heavenly art and struck out with his palm. The shadow of the prison-suppressing stele appeared in his palm, and the unique suppressing power of the prison-suppressing stele burst out.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>Under Lu Ming’s palm and under the cover of the prison-suppressing heaven technique, a few black shadows screamed and twisted continuously, as if they were in great pain.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few more punches and the few shadows retreated far away. Lu Ming strode toward the Jade token.</p><p>As he charged, he continuously used the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>The prison suppressing heavenly art seemed to be the nemesis of those black shadows. Wherever the prison suppressing heavenly art enveloped, those black shadows would retreat at an extreme speed.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Some people widened their eyes in shock when they saw this.</p><p>“It’s him. It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“He can counter those shadows!”</p><p>Someone shouted as he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>damn it. Brother, it’s him. It’s that Lu Ming!</p><p>Hai Tian also saw this scene and cried out in jealousy.</p><p>Hmph, let’s leave this place first. Even if he can get the Jade plate, he can’t leave this place!</p><p>Hai Yu snorted coldly. With the help of the other Supreme martial artists in the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, he led Hai Tian and charged out quickly.</p><p>Of course, it was also because Lu Ming had attracted a large number of black shadows when he rushed toward the Jade token that Hai Yu and the others were under less pressure. Otherwise, they might not have been able to rush out.</p><p>Just like that, Hai Yu and the others broke out of the encirclement and disappeared into the ancient city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
