Shut up!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the blood Sun continent shouted and slapped Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound was heard.</p><p>A person was staggering backward. It was not Lu Ming but the young man from the blood Sun continent.</p><p>A palm print appeared on his face, and one side of his face was swollen.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded look. He could not wrap his head around the situation.</p><p>He was the one who had attacked first, but Lu Ming had arrived first. His speed was shockingly fast and his palm slapped his face. His head was buzzing and he was completely dazed.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming! Do you know that you dare to attack us? We are representing young master Lin!”</p><p>He coldly berated.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>shut up! Lu Ming shouted. A cold killing intent burst out from his body. This killing intent made ice cold’s body shiver.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care if he was young master Lin or the pride of the tianshen sect. If it was anything else, he would not care. But since it involved Xie nianqing, Lu Ming would not give anyone face.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>At this moment, a light chuckle came from the box. Then, an elegant young man in a white robe walked out.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen him before. He was one of the three young geniuses from the deity sect who came to the continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Young master Lin walked to Lu Ming’s table. His face was calm, but his eyes were cold and arrogant. He looked down at Lu Ming and said, ” miss, you’re a peerless beauty. It’s a pity that you were born in the divine Ruins ‘continents. Are you willing to follow me? at that time, you don’t need to participate in the selection. You can directly enter the tianshen sect to cultivate and become an official disciple!</p><p>Hearing this, the elites of the land of Blood sun and ice cold were all envious.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant were even more excited. They wished they were Xie nianqing and took his place.</p><p>Young master Lin had a confident smile on his face. He believed that no one in the divine Ruins would reject such a tempting request.</p><p>“I’m not interested!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s indifferent voice made young master Lin’s face freeze.</p><p>“Young lady, you’d better consider this carefully. This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity for you!”</p><p>Young master Lin continued.</p><p>“I said, I’m not interested!”</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned and seemed a little impatient.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the other party was a heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect, Xie nianqing would have already flipped out.</p><p>“You really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>short-sighted and pretentious. She’s just a slut in nature!</p><p>The young man from the blood-sun land and the cold man shouted one after another.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exploded with an extremely strong killing intent. His cold eyes fell on the young man from the land of Blood Sun and he said coldly, ” “Since you said those words just now, you’re dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze made the paragons of the blood Sun continent shiver.</p><p>but thinking about young master Lin, his courage increased, ” “I’m talking about the matter. Why? You still want to attack young master Lin?”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! suddenly, Lu Ming shouted coldly. He rushed out and struck at the young man from the land of blood-sun.</p><p>The youth from the blood Sun continent was also at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. However, he was completely dumbfounded by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>This palm carried a terrifying pressure. When it acted on his body, it made him unable to move.</p><p>“Young master Lin, save me!”</p><p>The young man from the land of blood-sun screamed in fear.</p><p>“You dare to make a move in front of me!”</p><p>Young master Lin’s face was dark. He moved slightly. It was almost impossible to see his movements clearly, but his body suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming and he struck out a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with young master Lin’s, creating a dull thud.

He didn’t manage to take down Lu Ming with two moves and felt like he had lost face. He was prepared to use his killing move to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and his body swayed. Like a flash of light, he passed young master Lin and struck out at the young man from the blood Sun continent.</p><p>This palm was as fast as lightning, and even young master Lin didn’t have time to react.</p><p>The young man from the land of blood-sun widened his eyes in shock. But the next moment, his body was torn into pieces by Lu Ming’s palm.
