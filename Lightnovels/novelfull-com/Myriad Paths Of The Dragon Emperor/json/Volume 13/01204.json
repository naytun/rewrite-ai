The scorching flames seemed to be able to burn everything.</p><p>All around, the other young men stood up one after another. Their Zhen Yuan glowed and their wills surrounded them to resist the remaining power of the flame.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and struck a vine with his palm. A dull sound was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a scorching flame spreading towards him and his palm was slightly numb.</p><p>To be honest, mujue was very strong.</p><p>A ninth level divine level bloodline and a cultivation at the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was extremely terrifying and much stronger than e Kuang’s.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The flaming vine kept waving and lashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>With a single strike, these vines could crack the earth. Their power was terrifying. Lu Ming’s five-colored concept covered his entire body. The power of the prison suppressing heaven technique grew stronger and stronger as he struck out palm after palm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm kept clashing with the flaming vines. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>The fact that the two of them were evenly matched already shocked the others.</p><p>he’s so strong. This Lu Ming is so strong. Unbelievable. He’s actually able to fight mu Jue who’s at a higher level!</p><p>it’s indeed unbelievable. The divine wilderness continent is amazing!</p><p>The others exclaimed in admiration and looked at Lu Ming with fear.</p><p>All of them had awakened ninth level divine bloodlines and stood at the peak of all heaven’s pride experts. Their combat strength was unparalleled, and it was a common thing for them to fight above their level.</p><p>It was almost impossible for geniuses like them to be defeated by others who were at a higher level than them. Among geniuses with ninth level divine rank bloodlines, who would be much weaker than the other?</p><p>But now, mu Jue, who had reached the peak of the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, was being challenged by someone of a higher level. And the person who was fighting above his level was from the divine wilderness continent, a continent that was not very famous.</p><p>“Ah, die, die!”</p><p>Mujue roared.</p><p>His cultivation level was one level higher than Lu Ming’s, but he could not take Lu Ming down. This made him extremely angry.</p><p>If word of this got out, his reputation would definitely take a huge hit.</p><p>What was a genius? geniuses were meant to surpass levels and defeat others, not to be defeated by others. If one was defeated by others, what kind of genius was that?</p><p>He was bound to become a joke.</p><p>He was furious. He could not wait to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>He launched an even more violent attack.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Would shouting loudly make one stronger? A peak sixth level spiritual God with such little combat strength. How disappointing. It’s time to end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in disdain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged above his head.</p><p>“That is … His bloodline?”</p><p>it seems to be the legendary bloodline of the nine Dragons, but it’s only at the eighth level of the divine level. It’s actually only at the eighth level of the divine level!</p><p>The appearance of Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian caused another uproar.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons and roared. The devouring power enveloped mujue, causing the flaming vines to tremble.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>the nine Dragons continued to step forward and used the nine Dragons sky-treading steps. The violent power struck the flame vines.</p><p>After a few consecutive explosions, three of the flaming vines were instantly blown to pieces.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and each of their nine claws grabbed a flaming vine. With a powerful tear, the nine flaming vines were all torn apart and turned into flames.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The divine Dragon wagged its tail, and the nine Dragons ‘tails used the prison suppressing heavenly art to whip at the main part of the flaming vine.</p><p>The root of the flaming vine was directly sent flying, and it heavily hit the wall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Countless inscriptions glowed on the wall, but it still shook violently. Mu Jue let out a scream.</p><p>He was completely suppressed, completely crushed.</p><p>After Lu Ming performed the blood fusion, he completely crushed mu Jue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies and instantly appeared in front of mujue, their dragon claws continuously striking out.</p><p>The explosions continued, accompanied by mujue’s shrill screams, causing many people to shiver.</p><p>After more than ten moves, mu Jue finally couldn’t hold on any longer. His bloodline collapsed and he returned to his original form.</p><p>At this moment, his hair was disheveled and he was spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. His entire body was covered in injuries and he was in an extremely miserable state.</p><p>Among the crowd, Mu Feng’s face was pale and bloodless.</p><p>Mu Jue, who had reached the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm, had been defeated. He had never dreamed that he would be defeated so miserably.</p><p>Initially, he thought that he could use mu Jue to cripple Lu Ming and avenge the day he was beaten up by Lu Ming. He never expected that such a powerful mu Jue would follow in his footsteps.</p><p>“Bastard, you dare to hit me? you’re dead!”</p><p>Mujue roared in anger. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>After today, he, mu Jue, would become the laughingstock of the South God Palace.</p><p>The nine Dragons shrank and Lu Ming turned into his human form. His eyes were cold as he kicked mu Jue’s face. Mu Jue screamed in pain and his head hit the wall hard. His face was deformed.</p><p>“You still dare to threaten me? do you believe that I won’t kill you right now?”</p><p>The murderous intent on Lu Ming was so strong that it sent a chill down mujue’s spine.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>Mujue roared in his heart, but he didn’t dare to say another word.</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red hair fluttered in the wind. His eyes were bloodshot. His killing intent was too strong and cold. He really suspected that Lu Ming would kill him if he said anything more.</p><p>He stretched out his hand and sucked. With a sweep of his essential core, the storage ring in mujue’s hand flew to Lu Ming and was caught in his hand.</p><p>this storage ring will be your punishment for my emotional damage!</p><p>Lu Ming slowly put away mujue’s storage ring.</p><p>“You … You can’t do this …”</p><p>Mujue wailed. That storage ring was all his savings.</p><p>Also, what compensation for emotional damage? speaking of compensation, shouldn’t he be the one who should be compensated? He had been beaten up so badly?</p><p>“You want to die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s blood-red eyes focused, causing mu Jue to not dare to make a sound. However, his body trembled slightly because of his anger.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently and turned to leave.</p><p>If this had happened in the divine wilderness continent, Lu Ming would have smacked him to death. But this was the divine Ruins continent, after all. Lu Ming had only shown mercy because he had just arrived.</p><p>Mujue glared at Lu Ming hatefully. He staggered to his feet and walked toward the portal.</p><p>“Cousin, wait for me!”</p><p>Mu Feng was so scared that his legs were trembling. He quickly followed mu Jue and left the place.</p><p>“Brother pang, the sword-shaped stone you wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward pang Yuan and handed the sword-shaped stone to him.</p><p>hahaha, brother Lu’s combat strength is really admirable. Mujue, that arrogant and domineering guy, finally kicked an iron plate today!</p><p>Pang Yuan laughed and handed the fire spirit root to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother pang is too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Both of them had gained something and were happy.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The beautiful lady in the red dress looked at Lu Ming. Her heroic eyes were filled with curiosity and fighting spirit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
