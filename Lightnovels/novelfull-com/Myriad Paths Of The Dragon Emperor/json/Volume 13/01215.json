What was it? A sect? Could he be the mastermind behind the battle of Providence?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming thought of many things but he also had many more questions.</p><p>However, one thing was for sure. The headless true dragon Riders seemed to be on the same side as the so-called Hunyuan sect. At least, they were not enemies. That was why he let them go.</p><p>“This is an unparalleled expert. His battle soul did not dissipate after his death and transformed into a headless true dragon Rider to guard this territory. And, Hunyuan sect?”</p><p>Dandan slowly opened her mouth, as if she was trying to recall something, her brows furrowed.</p><p>Suddenly, dandan raised her eyebrows and her eyes lit up.</p><p>“Dandan, what did you remember?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Hunyuan sect, the number one sect in the world, the most powerful force!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“The number one sect in the world? You mean the primordial realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“This world is very big, and it’s not just the primordial realm!” Dandan said.</p><p>“You mean, heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. He was very shocked.</p><p>Of course, the conversation between the two of them was done through voice transmission, so no one else could hear it.</p><p>Xie nianqing didn’t think much of it. He wasn’t familiar with Long Chen yet, and there were some things he didn’t want Long Chen to know.</p><p>that’s right. Hunyuan sect was the number one sect in the world. Unfortunately, it was destroyed back then. This place is most likely related to Hunyuan sect. Therefore, you have the Hunyuan token, so the headless true dragon Knight won’t kill you!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Dandan, what happened in the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at dandan and asked.</p><p>Lu Ming was very curious. He realized that many things in the primordial realm were related to the heaven realm.</p><p>According to legend, in ancient times, a corpse fell from the sky and formed the hundred deities slope in Tianxuan region.</p><p>There was also the ancient barren city, which was also an item of the heaven realm. In the end, it even broke through the void and arrived on a small island in the heaven realm.</p><p>There was also the heaven Gate, which was connected to the heaven realm.</p><p>Now, the battle of Providence was also suspected to be controlled by the heaven realm primordial chaos sect.</p><p>And the divine Ruins of today.</p><p>The primordial realm seemed to be inextricably linked to the heaven realm.</p><p>Dandan would often Mutter that the battle that year …</p><p>What did that battle mean?</p><p>Since Hunyuan sect was the number one sect in the world, why was it destroyed? Was it because of the three-eyed God race?</p><p>I can’t tell you. First of all, I’m also a blur and can’t remember clearly. Second, your cultivation is too weak. It won’t do you any good to tell you. Some things will naturally be known when your cultivation reaches a certain realm!</p><p>Dandan said in a deep voice, a rare seriousness in her tone.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. However, he could not be bothered to ask since she did not want to say.</p><p>Indeed, that matter was too far away from him. His current goal was to improve his cultivation and deal with Di Yi.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are we going in?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked as he looked at the palace in front of him.</p><p>“Let’s go in. Since the headless true dragon Rider isn’t hostile to us, let’s go in and have a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Long Chen nodded without hesitation.</p><p>“Indeed, there might be some opportunities inside. If I encounter any treasures, I’ll be rich!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up again.</p><p>Immediately, the three people and one turtle walked toward the palace gate.</p><p>As he walked through the door, his field of vision also widened, and he could vaguely see the scene of the hall.</p><p>The main hall was very spacious. In the middle was a huge passageway. On both sides of the passageway were stone rooms.</p><p>The few of them checked a few stone rooms but found nothing.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Suddenly, Long Chen’s expression changed. He seemed to have sensed something. He strode forward and came to a sealed stone room.</p><p>At this point, Long Chen’s body glowed, and the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline appeared on his head.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline howled and rammed into the stone door of the stone chamber.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone door opened, and a domineering aura emanated from within.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were shocked to see a statue in the stone room.</p><p>This statue was clearly a giant elephant. The giant elephant’s body was covered in scales, and its aura was domineering.</p><p>This was clearly an Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>There was actually a statue of an Archean dragonesque elephant here. It was lifelike and looked exactly the same as Long Chen’s bloodline. However, its aura was stronger, more shocking, and more overbearing.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes lit up. He strode in and sat cross-legged under the statue. The bloodline of the ancient dragon elephant on his head resonated with the statue, and the statue glowed.</p><p>this kid’s luck isn’t bad. He’s obtained a great opportunity!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Long Chen had indeed encountered a great opportunity. The statue of the Archean dragonesque elephant was definitely left behind by a Supreme Master. It contained the divine aura of the Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>I think long Chen will be cultivating here for a while. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, she left the place with Xie nianqing.</p><p>As they advanced, they looked at every secret room on both sides of the passage, but unfortunately, they found nothing.</p><p>Not long after, they passed through the passage. Behind them was a stretch of ruins.</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing’s forehead started to glow.</p><p>“There seems to be something underground!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he began to dig underground in the ruins. Very soon, he had dug tens of meters deep. A huge Divine Ruins ancient mine appeared below.</p><p>Yes, a Divine Ruins ancient mine was the size of a water tank, dozens of times larger than other Divine Ruins ancient mines.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming mentioned it but he did not mention it.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with eight streams of dragon power before he could lift the divine Ruins ancient mine, which was the size of a water tank, and fly it into the deep pit.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s true essence was boiling, and his demonic Qi was shining. The heavenly demon bloodline appeared above his head, and his demonic Qi soared to the sky.</p><p>I have a strong reaction to this Divine Ruins ‘ancient mine. It seems that there’s a fiend inside!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with curiosity and nervousness.</p><p>rich, rich, this chick is rich! Inside this Divine Ruins ancient mine, there’s indeed incredible things sealed!</p><p>Dandan circled around the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, her two eyes shining as she muttered non-stop.</p><p>“Let’s break it open and see!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Wait a moment, let me set up the formation, just in case!”</p><p>Dandan called out to Lu Ming and then set up a dense array around the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>“It’s done!” Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. His vital essence condensed into a knife and began to cut the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>The glistening yellow ore was cut off layer by layer, and slowly, the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine became smaller and smaller. Finally, it was only the size of a fist.</p><p>“It’s so small, what could be inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious and his essential core vibrated.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The ancient mine of the divine Ruins cracked open. Suddenly, a powerful demonic Qi spread out from the crack. This demonic Qi was extremely terrifying. Although it did not feel strong, the aura was high and mighty, like an Emperor looking down on all living beings.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine exploded, and a black round ball the size of a Dragon’s Eye appeared in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
