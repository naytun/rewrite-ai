Someone passed!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>A spot of light lit up in front of them, and a figure appeared in the light.</p><p>“It’s Eden, Eden of the eastern God Palace!” He exclaimed.</p><p>it’s really Eden. It’s not Lu Ming or Bing Kong. It seems that Eden’s combat strength is extremely terrifying!</p><p>Eden was the first one to appear, which was a bit surprising.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s performance was very domineering. Many people thought that Lu Ming would be the first to succeed.</p><p>This time, it was not a fighting ring that appeared in the light spot. It was just a platform that could only allow one person to stand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another spot of light appeared not far from Eden. This time, it was Bing Kong, the strongest heaven’s favorite of the North God Palace.</p><p>At the same time, there was only a platform under the ice. He stood on the platform and looked at Eden with sharp eyes.</p><p>It was as if they could see each other.</p><p>Eden’s gaze also turned to the ice, and there seemed to be a flame bursting out between the two.</p><p>“The second one to succeed was Bing Kong, not Lu Ming. It seems like I’ve overestimated him!”</p><p>that’s normal. The first few rounds tested one’s willpower. Willpower is a huge factor. Lu Ming’s willpower is strong, but that doesn’t mean that his combat strength is superior to everyone else. Eden, Bing Kong, and the others are all extremely terrifying and have unparalleled combat strength. I’m afraid they can defeat young master Lin!</p><p>“Shush, lower your voice!”</p><p>Some of them were discussing. When they finished speaking, they quickly shut their mouths and carefully looked in the direction of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>Unfortunately, although her voice was soft, young master Lin still heard her. This made his face turn even darker.</p><p>In the void passageway, Lu Ming was still challenging the levels. However, he did not unleash his strongest combat strength or perform the bloodline fusion. He only unleashed nine streams of dragon energy, supported by his intent realm, and performed the prison-suppressing heavenly technique, breaking through all the levels.</p><p>I feel like my water concept is about to break through!</p><p>In the midst of the battle, the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile.</p><p>When he was in the divine Ruins, his Thunder, fire, and wind concepts had already broken through to the full circle of level four. There was also the earth and water concepts, which were still at the peak of level four great completion.</p><p>Now, after a series of battles, his water concept finally showed signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>As such, Lu Ming was no longer in a hurry. He focused on operating his intent to resist the outside world.</p><p>He couldn’t miss such an opportunity. If he missed it, he didn’t know when he would be able to break through again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed of clearing the levels gradually slowed down.</p><p>As time passed, the number of successful challengers slowly increased.</p><p>Zi Wuji, Jian Zhan, and Xue Mingyang followed closely behind Eden and Bing Kong.</p><p>Behind Xue Mingyang and the other two, a young man with skin as hard as iron stepped out.</p><p>Everyone recognized him. He was the number one prodigy of the third continent, tie Hong of the godly metal continent.</p><p>Not long after, a beautiful woman appeared. She was also a Dark Horse that rose from a small continent. Before, she had attracted a lot of attention, and now, she was the seventh to pass.</p><p>Lu Ming hasn’t appeared yet. It seems like his combat strength isn’t that strong!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>This made young master Lin’s face even gloomier.</p><p>His heart was conflicted.</p><p>Firstly, he wanted Lu Ming to fail the round and be eliminated. However, this would mean that Lu Ming’s combat level was low. If Lu Ming could defeat him despite his low combat level, did that not mean that he was even more trashy?</p><p>Now, he felt very uncomfortable when he heard others discussing Lu Ming’s combat level.</p><p>“It’s all because of that guy, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Young master Lin gritted his teeth.</p><p>In the void, there were seven spots of light. In the spots of light, there were platforms. Seven people stood on the platforms.</p><p>It was as if there was a transparent bubble wrapped around a platform in the void. It was arranged in an arc, and they could all see each other.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another spot of light appeared, and a figure appeared on the platform.</p><p>Long Chen. The eighth to appear was long Chen.</p><p>that’s the divine wilderness continent’s long Chen. This person’s cultivation is only at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, but he actually managed to clear the stage. It’s really unbelievable!</p><p>that’s right. Eighth level spiritual God Realm geniuses like ice Dragon and Ji hongchen have been eliminated. He managed to pass the test with his cultivation at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Long Chen’s appearance caused a wave of discussion. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>the bloodline of the Archean dragonesque elephant, one of the top ten Battle Beasts. It is indeed unfathomable and difficult to predict!</p><p>The eyes of the experts from Dragon God Valley were burning with passion.</p><p>The other three powers also revealed expressions of interest. Even in the yuan continent, it was extremely rare to see someone who could awaken such a bloodline.</p><p>After long Chen, another dot of light appeared, and a beautiful woman stepped out.</p><p>Xie nianqing!</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled and they looked surprised.</p><p>Obviously, they didn’t expect the person to be Xie nianqing.</p><p>Like long Chen, Xie nianqing was also at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. Even the experts from the four forces of the yuan continent were surprised that he could pass the test.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Seeing Xie nianqing’s figure, Xie nianjun’s body trembled violently. His face was full of disbelief and he couldn’t accept it.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s success meant that he didn’t use much of his combat power in the previous battle. This was a huge blow to her.</p><p>Her heart was filled with jealousy, causing the muscles on her face to twist slightly, making her look a little ferocious.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Long Chen looked at each other and nodded slightly. Then, they looked around. When they didn’t see Lu Ming, they were both surprised.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming should have already succeeded in clearing the stage.</p><p>“He will definitely succeed. It’s just that he has been delayed by something!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered. She had full confidence in Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>After a while, 15 people had been eliminated.</p><p>Initially, there were twenty-five people. Now, fifteen had been eliminated and nine had successfully cleared the level. There was still one person who was still in the midst of clearing the level, and this person was obviously Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on? Lu Ming has not come out yet. He has not been eliminated and he has not succeeded in clearing the stage!”</p><p>“It is indeed strange!”</p><p>what’s so strange about that? I think he’s just struggling because he’s not strong enough. He’s just unwilling to give up. Hmph, he’s just trash!</p><p>There were also people who were disdainful and sneered. Everyone looked over and saw that it was the proud Son of Heaven of the North God Palace, Ice Dragon.</p><p>On the side of the heavenly God sect, young master Lin’s face turned black again. He was so depressed that he was about to vomit blood.</p><p>It was an undeniable fact that Lu Ming had defeated him. Now that others were belittling and looking down on Lu Ming, it was the same as belittling and looking down on him. If they said that Lu Ming was trash, they would be saying that he was worse than trash.</p><p>He had been shot without doing anything, so how could he not be depressed? but he couldn’t do anything.</p><p>Could it be that he had to stand up for Lu Ming and teach those people who belittled Lu Ming a lesson?</p><p>Wouldn’t he be even more depressed?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
