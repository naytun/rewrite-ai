To be able to take a blow from me and only retreat three steps without being injured, you’re quite strong!</p><p>...</p><p>The Ice Dragon stepped down and spoke indifferently, with an arrogant look.</p><p>Previously, he had seen Lu Ming kill Silver Wing and brutal wind, but he was still full of confidence.</p><p>Stepping onto the 36 Tiangang peaks didn’t mean anything. He didn’t care about Silver Wing and brutal wind at all.</p><p>“You also want my key?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the Ice Dragon and said.</p><p>hehe, you just happened to encounter it, so you naturally can’t miss it. You can only blame yourself for being too unlucky!</p><p>The Ice Dragon spoke in a cold voice as if it had Lu Ming in the palm of its hand.</p><p>“You’re that confident? Just now, Silver Wing and brutal wind were just as confident, but in the end, they were just giving me the key!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to those two pieces of trash. Otherwise, you’ll realize that you’ve made a huge mistake!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon smiled confidently.</p><p>As he spoke, he strode towards Lu Ming, his body exuding a terrifying chill.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential Qi was boiling and burning.</p><p>“It seems like you want to fight to the death. You’re really like a Mantis trying to stop a car!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s voice turned cold. Endless ice crystals suddenly appeared around his body.</p><p>The water vapor in the air was frozen by the cold air and condensed. Around the Ice Dragon, even the wind stopped, as if it had been frozen.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Ice Dragon pointed a finger at Lu Ming, and a terrifying cold air shot towards him.</p><p>The cold air seemed to be able to freeze everything in its path.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s body, vital essence was howling. The five types of heaven and earth concepts were circulated to the extreme, forming a pair of five-colored boxing gloves on his fists. Then, he punched out at the finger force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a violent explosion, a white wave of cold air spread out in all directions. At this moment, with them as the center, the sky within a thousand miles was white and countless ice crystals appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed and he took two steps back.</p><p>“It’s so cold!”</p><p>This time, not only on Lu Ming’s fist, but on his body as well. A layer of white ice crystals appeared.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Ice Dragon raised its eyebrows. It was clearly surprised that Lu Ming had caught its finger.</p><p>He was confident that he could kill Silver Wing and man Feng with this finger.</p><p>“Ten thousand miles of ice!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s aura grew even colder. This time, it switched its fingers to a palm and smacked out. The entire sky was filled with cold air that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the space seemed to be frozen. Lu Ming felt as if his body had fallen into a swamp and he could not move.</p><p>“Die! It’s your honor to die in this move of mine!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s cold voice rang out.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then let’s try the ninth dragon power!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. A Dragon’s Roar rang out from his body and the ninth dragon energy erupted!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was covered in a layer of purple crystal Light. His muscles were squirming slightly.</p><p>“This power?”</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have transformed into Nine Dragons. His dragon energy was boiling and filled with endless power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With Lu Ming as the center, the space within a five-kilometer radius was annihilated and turned into nothingness. The feeling of falling into a swamp also disappeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, he threw another punch at the Ice Dragon and it collided with his palm.</p><p>“This strength …”</p><p>When the fist and palm collided, the Ice Dragon’s expression changed greatly. His body trembled, and nine layers of thick ice crystals appeared in front of him. At the same time, he quickly retreated.</p><p>Boom Boom …</p><p>The nine layers of ice crystals were reduced to ashes under Lu Ming’s terrifying strength.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The ice crystals contained boundless cold air. They wanted to seal Lu Ming in ice but Lu Ming shook them away with his strength.</p><p>this cold Qi seems to be the ice mentality, but why is it so terrifying? the temperature is so low!</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little surprised.</p><p>He had come into contact with the ice concept many times. Although it was powerful, it was still a hundred thousand miles away from the Ice Dragon.</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s frost concept was extremely powerful. Lu Ming had never seen it before.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, but the Ice dragon’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually defeat him head-on. It was beyond his expectations.</p><p>it seems that you have been hiding your strength. Your strength is indeed amazing, but it’s still too early to fight with me!</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s voice became colder and colder. The aura on his body also became stronger and the cold air became colder.</p><p>The early stage of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm was the cultivation of the Ice Dragon.</p><p>At such a young age, his cultivation had already reached the early stage of the eighth level spiritual God Realm. In addition to that extremely terrifying ice concept, the Ice Dragon could easily kill a great circle spiritual God.</p><p>“Martial technique of intent, absolute zero!”</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, the Ice Dragon performed the bloodline fusion and turned into an ice sword. The sword light was shocking.</p><p>The moment the sword light appeared, everything in the world seemed to stop moving. It was as if they had been frozen. There was only the sword light in the world.</p><p>The icy sword slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze turned solemn.</p><p>The Ice Dragon’s cultivation was one level higher than his, and with the terrifying ice concept, his combat power was shocking.</p><p>The Ice Dragon indeed had the right to be arrogant. For example, Silver Wing and brutal wind were not even worthy of carrying the shoes for the Ice Dragon. If they were too far apart, they would be killed with a casual move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming also performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons stepped in the air and charged toward the Ice Dragon. The two of them began a great battle.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire area was blown apart, and an endless amount of energy mixed with a terrifying chill wreaked havoc in the world.</p><p>In the distance, some people saw Lu Ming’s blood-red light pillar and wanted to rush over to see what was going on. However, thousands of miles away, they saw the two of them fighting. All of them widened their eyes in horror and turned to leave.</p><p>“Heavens, how can he be so strong? Are they still of the same generation as us?”</p><p>that’s too terrifying. With such strength, he can almost fight with a Supreme-being, right? ”</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites all scattered in fear. They didn’t dare to get too close, afraid that they would be sucked in and die.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had exchanged dozens of moves with the Ice Dragon.</p><p>The Dragon’s roars shook the sky as Lu Ming’s courage mounted as the battle progressed. Every inch of the nine Dragons ‘bodies and muscles were weapons of war. He used the true dragon combat technique, Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, and the prison suppressing heavenly technique in turns.</p><p>The power of the nine Dragons seemed to be able to destroy everything, and the power of the prison suppression heavenly art seemed to be able to suppress everything.</p><p>Although the Ice Dragon’s frost concept was extremely terrifying, Lu Ming had comprehended five types of heaven and earth concepts after all. When they were gathered together, he could still resist it.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The Dragon Claw broke through the ice Dragon’s Ice Armor and left a deep mark on it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The divine Dragon wagged its tail, and the prison suppressing heavenly art burst forth, sending the Ice Dragon flying.</p><p>“Who is this person? Which continent does he come from? how could he have such astonishing battle strength?”</p><p>The Ice Dragon quickly retreated. The more he fought, the more shocked he became.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
