To be able to cultivate to such a realm in the divine Ruins continent group at such an age is really rare. If he doesn’t participate in the assessment, wouldn’t it be a pity? ”</p><p>on behalf of Dragon God Valley, I invite you to take part in the assessment!</p><p>Long Quan shouted.</p><p>“No, he can’t participate …”</p><p>young master Lin shouted.</p><p>shut up! Who Do You Think You Are? I’m talking. Who are you to interrupt me? ”</p><p>Long Quan’s eyes turned cold and an extremely strong aura exploded out. The terrifying aura caused the entire world to shake. Young master Lin’s face was ashen white.</p><p>I’m inviting Lu Ming to take part in the assessment. Do you have any objections? ”</p><p>Long Quan looked at the jiuxiao sword sect and the Tianyu demonic sect. Finally, his eyes fell on the white-haired elder of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“No objections!”</p><p>“Of course I have no objections!”</p><p>The leaders of the jiuxiao sword sect and the Tianyu demon sect nodded.</p><p>“I naturally have no objections to this child’s battle prowess!”</p><p>Finally, the white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect also spoke.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>young master Lin roared in his heart and was filled with unwillingness.</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s good. Lu Ming, what do you say?”</p><p>Long Quan laughed and looked at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“How can junior refuse senior’s kind intentions!” Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>alright, let the test officially begin!</p><p>Long Quan waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, the youths chose the light door and rushed in.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing separated. They each chose a door of light and rushed in.</p><p>At this moment, some of them had already gone in for a while, but there was still no movement.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed into the door of light, he felt a ray of light enveloping him. His body felt a slight warmth, but the next moment, this feeling disappeared. Lu Ming realized that he had appeared in a passage.</p><p>The passageway was very wide, and the walls were filled with glittering inscriptions.</p><p>According to the rules, they had to keep going forward in the void passage. Whoever could reach the end would be first.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and there was no movement.</p><p>After walking for a few thousand meters, the appearance of the passage in front of them changed. It was now a section that was surrounded by stone walls.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly the moment he stepped into the passage.</p><p>Because at this moment, his aura was rapidly weakening, and in the end, he returned to being ordinary.</p><p>His cultivation had been suppressed, making him look like a mortal. Not only was his true Yuan, but his intent and bloodline had also been suppressed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and found that his prison-suppressing stele bloodline was glowing and fluctuating. As for the third bloodline, Lu Ming felt that he could completely control it and was not suppressed at all.</p><p>Only the bloodline of the nine Dragons was completely suppressed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change as he looked around.</p><p>On the surrounding stone walls, there were messy carvings of different depths and in a mess.</p><p>In front of him, there was a flash of light, and a figure condensed.</p><p>This person had the appearance of a young man. He wore a black robe, had a cold expression, and carried a long spear on his back.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this person was condensed by the array.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a shake of the long spear, the Spear’s gleam pierced towards Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>However, the spear gleam did not contain any primordial Qi. It was probably just physical strength, which was similar to Lu Ming’s physical strength.</p><p>Lu Ming instinctively wanted to activate the power of his third bloodline to defeat the figure.</p><p>However, Lu Ming immediately stopped the eruption of his third Blood Meridian.</p><p>Even the bloodline of the nine Dragons could be suppressed in this level. This meant that he had to pass this level without using his bloodline power. If he had used his bloodline power, it was possible that people outside would have sensed it.</p><p>That would be too special.</p><p>His prison-suppressing stele bloodline, especially the third bloodline, was very special. He did not want others to find out.</p><p>At the thought of this, he didn’t activate his bloodline. Instead, he used the power of his physical body and rushed to the right, where a black spear was.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Spear’s gleam was like lightning, enveloping Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>This was an extremely exquisite spear technique. Although it wasn’t powerful, the trajectory it moved in was exquisite.</p><p>There was no vital essence in Lu Ming’s body and he could not use his intent. He could not use martial arts to resist at all and could only rely on his physical strength to Dodge.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Lu Ming’s back was cut by the Spear’s gleam, tearing a hole in his clothes. If not for Lu Ming’s quick reaction, he would have been injured.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had fought countless battles along the way and had rich combat experience. He dodged the attacks and rushed to the black spear. He picked up the spear and swept it out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two long Spears collided with a loud clang. Lu Ming felt his arm go numb and he took two steps back.</p><p>The black-robed young man formed by the formation had the same physical strength as Lu Ming. However, he had the support of a mysterious martial arts technique and his attack power was above Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The ice-cold tip of the spear turned into a sharp, cold light, piercing the air and stabbing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and fixed his gaze on the other party’s spearlight. Then, he stabbed a few times in succession.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed at the next moment.</p><p>He felt that his spear had missed. He had been confident that he could block his opponent’s attack after a few thrusts. However, after thrusting out, he realized that his opponent’s spear tip shook slightly and continued to stab toward him.</p><p>The exquisiteness of the spear technique was truly profound and unpredictable.</p><p>what a powerful spear technique! It combines strength and speed to the peak. When it’s used, it’s unpredictable and unpredictable!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>If his cultivation had not been suppressed, such a spear technique would be useless in the face of absolute power, even though it was extremely exquisite. No matter how exquisite a martial arts technique was, it would be as fragile as tofu under Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>But now, under the situation where his cultivation was suppressed, this martial technique was able to release a huge power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming took a step back and retreated far away.</p><p>However, there was still a small bloody mark on his chest. He had been stabbed by the spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, the black-robed young man’s spear force surged toward Lu Ming like an endless tide.</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps back and tried his best to Dodge. At the same time, he was thinking about how to counter the other party’s moves.</p><p>At this moment, outside the ancient city of the divine Ruins, outside the void passageway, countless people stood in the air and watched.</p><p>Suddenly, the door of light shone, and a figure appeared.</p><p>“Someone has failed!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>It was obvious that someone had failed and was teleported out.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Those who had been teleported out shook their heads and sighed. If they could not even pass the first stage, it was almost impossible for them to be selected by the major sects of the yuan continent.</p><p>The people from the four sects of the yuanlu continent were expressionless. They did not even look at those who failed.</p><p>The first stage was a test of one’s comprehension. If one could not even pass the first stage, it was not worth their attention.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
