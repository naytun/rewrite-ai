He first collected Dark Thunder Supreme’s blood essence and then walked towards Thunder Rhino Supreme.</p><p>...</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming approach, Supreme lightning rhinoceros was terrified.</p><p>He let out a roar and desperately tried to break through, but in the next instant, a transparent bubble appeared and enveloped Supreme lightning rhinoceros, imprisoning him.</p><p>“Don’t kill me! Spare me! Spare me!”</p><p>Seeing this, Supreme lightning rhinoceros was terrified and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>To be honest, he was still young. From the moment he was born until now, he had only lived for a thousand years. A Supreme-being had five thousand years of life. He still had a long time. He didn’t want to die.</p><p>“What a joke. You wanted to kill me just now, and now you’re asking me to let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his killing intent cold.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dandan slapped Supreme Thunder Rhino on the head, causing him to feel dizzy.</p><p>“No, spare me. I can do anything you want. I can rely on you, I can be your Mount!”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros shouted.</p><p>At this time, he couldn’t care about anything else, only hoping to save his life.</p><p>“Eh? Dandan, wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Taking Supreme lightning rhinoceros as a Mount was not a bad idea.</p><p>After killing Supreme Thunder Rhino, Lu Ming could only keep the materials on his body and the nine drops of his blood essence.</p><p>However, if he were to take him as a Mount, a living Supreme martial artist would be able to help Lu Ming with many things.</p><p>“Dandan, do you have any way to control him?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked dandan.</p><p>don’t worry. As long as he doesn’t resist, I have a hundred ways to control him. I’ll make him behave himself and not dare to have any second thoughts!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Lightning Rhino, don’t resist!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros was helpless and could only obediently let dandan inscribe a spell formation in his spiritual God. If he were to change his mind, dandan would be able to kill him easily.</p><p>After inscribing the formation, dandan transformed back into little turtle, while Thunder Rhino Supreme transformed back into his human form. He bowed to Lu Ming obediently, feeling helpless, but in order to save his life, he had to do this.</p><p>“Lei Xi, I still need to cultivate for a few days. You stay in the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>With that, the mountain and river diagram appeared.</p><p>“An estate-world treasure!”</p><p>When Supreme lightning rhinoceros saw this, he was greatly shocked.</p><p>In his eyes, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable.</p><p>There was a small turtle and a chubby spirit mouse beside him. They were all terrifyingly powerful and unbelievably powerful. Lu Ming’s combat strength was even more amazing.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram glowed, and the lightning rhinoceros was absorbed into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, the bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged and started to devour Dark Thunder Supreme’s energy and true essence.</p><p>The dark Thunder Supreme mainly cultivated the Thunder mentality. However, Lu Ming’s Thunder mentality had already reached the perfected spiritual God Realm. It was no longer useful for him to devour and refine it.</p><p>Lu Ming devoured the vital essence energy. He then found a place and started refining it.</p><p>How strong was the true essence of a Supreme martial artist? The energy essence contained in the blood was also extremely powerful. Lu Ming began to refine it and convert it into essential core to improve his cultivation.</p><p>As he refined it, Lu Ming’s cultivation level also began to increase continuously.</p><p>The early stage of the seventh level spiritual God Realm. Not long after, it advanced to the late stage of the seventh level spiritual God Realm and then the peak of the seventh level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current level of conception, as long as he had enough energy, he could advance to the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The true energy in his body circulated and became boundless.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days passed. Lu Ming’s cultivation finally made another breakthrough and he reached the early eighth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The vital essence and blood energy of a Supreme-being had raised Lu Ming’s cultivation by a full level, reaching the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>the true essence of an eighth level spiritual God is several times stronger than that of a seventh level spiritual God!</p><p>Feeling the vast essential core in his body, Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with confidence.</p><p>The breakthrough in his cultivation had undoubtedly increased his combat strength by a large margin.</p><p>Now, he could kill a heaven’s favorite like the Thunder bull in one move if he used all his strength.</p><p>Right now, he was confident that even if he didn’t rely on the lightning cauldron or the bubbles, he would be able to fight against a Supreme like dark Thunder with his own battle prowess.</p><p>Of course, there were also strong and weak Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Some of them had awakened seventh level divine bloodlines, eighth level divine bloodlines, and even ninth level divine Supremes. Naturally, they would be even stronger.</p><p>“Half a month is almost up, it’s time to go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, then took a step and turned into a ray of light, heading towards the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the ancient city of the divine Ruins. Xie nianqing and Lu Ming walked side by side.</p><p>the ancient Divine Ruins city seems to have even more people!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. In the ancient city of the divine Ruins, people were coming and going. He felt that the density of the people was even greater than before.</p><p>After asking around, he found out that the selection of the disciples of the deity sect was about to reach the end. A large number of experts from all over the divine Ruins continent had rushed over to watch.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was not hard to understand. The major sects of the yuanlu continent selected their disciples in the divine Ruins, which was rare since ancient times. It was normal to attract so many people.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked around casually. They had been in seclusion for days and it was a good time to relax.</p><p>After walking around for a while, the two of them walked up to a luxurious restaurant, planning to have something to eat.</p><p>The restaurant’s business was very good, and many seats were full.</p><p>The two of them went all the way to the highest floor before they found a place to sit down and ordered some wine and food.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they ate.</p><p>After nearly half a month of cultivation, Xie nianqing’s martial arts technique of creation had greatly improved. Her combat power had also increased a lot.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The fifth floor was divided into two areas. On one side were private rooms, and on the other side were ordinary dining tables.</p><p>At this moment, the door of a private room opened, and two young men walked out.</p><p>“Ice Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. One of the young men was the Ice Dragon that he had defeated.</p><p>The other one was walking side by side with Ice Dragon. He had a confident smile on his face. It was obvious that he was also a heaven’s favorite at the same level as Ice Dragon.</p><p>that’s a heaven’s favorite from the blood Sun continent!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the other young man and had an idea.</p><p>The blood Sun continent was the second-ranked continent in the continent group of the divine Ruins. This continent was also filled with experts and geniuses.</p><p>Although it could not be compared to the divine Ruins continent, it was stronger than the other continents and could not be underestimated.</p><p>The two of them walked toward Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s table.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly as he continued to drink.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming, right?”</p><p>The Ice Dragon looked at Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>“Not bad, it seems like your memory isn’t bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We’ll settle our scores another day!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon looked at Xie nianqing and said, ” “You’re Xie nianqing, right?”</p><p>“Not bad!” Xie nianqing said.</p><p>very good, your opportunity has come. In that private room is the unparalleled genius from the deity sect, young master Lin. He thinks that you are not bad and asked you to accompany him for a drink. If you are good at accompanying him, you may even have the opportunity to sleep with him. In that case, you will be able to climb up to a higher branch!</p><p>The Ice Dragon said.</p><p>Xie nianqing furrowed his brows at his words. Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
