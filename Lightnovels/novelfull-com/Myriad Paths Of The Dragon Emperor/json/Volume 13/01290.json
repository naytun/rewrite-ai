The light did not move at all. Instead, Hai Yu was pushed back by a powerful force.</p><p>Then, the primordial chaos token released a beam of light that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel a strong pulling force trying to pull him to another place.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>All of a sudden, the space trembled and Lu Ming felt the world spinning. His vision turned black and he was plunged into boundless darkness.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that he seemed to be passing through a long void and on a journey.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming felt that he had regained his ability to move. There was light shining into his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes instinctively and looked around.</p><p>As expected, his surroundings had changed. He was no longer in the ancient underwater city, but in a Hall.</p><p>The main hall was tall and majestic. The surrounding walls were built with huge rocks and were filled with an ancient and vicissitude aura. Moreover, there was a kind of chaotic mist floating on the walls. Lu Ming had never seen this kind of mist before, but it gave him a lofty, ancient and vast feeling.</p><p>“Where is this place? Did the primordial chaos token bring me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a series of questions in his heart.</p><p>the primordial chaos token had suddenly appeared on its own and emitted a blinding light. The reason he had appeared here was definitely related to it.</p><p>However, why did the mixed essence token suddenly act strangely and bring him here at that time?</p><p>What was the reason?</p><p>The more he thought about it, the more doubts Lu Ming had.</p><p>Also, dandan and bubbles were still in the underwater ancient city and had not followed them. He did not know if they would be in danger facing Hai Yu and the others.</p><p>dandan and bubble are both in the top ten. Their life-saving means must be superb. They should be fine!</p><p>Lu Ming comforted himself.</p><p>Then, he looked around carefully.</p><p>There was nothing in the empty Hall, and no one was there. There was only a huge door in front of the hall, which seemed to be a passage.</p><p>“Excuse me, is anyone there?”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth but there was no one. He did not get any reply.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and asked another question. However, there was still no answer.</p><p>Just when Lu Ming thought that there were no living creatures here, a voice was suddenly heard.</p><p>after so many years, someone has finally come!</p><p>The voice was shrill and dry, without any emotion.</p><p>“Senior, I’m lu Ming. May I know why you’ve brought me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming perked up when he heard the sound. He cupped his fists and said to the void.</p><p>“The primordial chaos token brought you here because you met the requirements!”</p><p>The shriveled voice was heard again. Then, the space in front of Lu Ming rippled and a figure stepped out.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned at the sight of this figure.</p><p>This was because this figure was very strange. Although it had the appearance of a middle-aged man, its entire body was khaki. Even its skin and hair were khaki-colored, as if it was sculpted from rock.</p><p>However, this khaki-colored burly man gave Lu Ming a feeling that he was vast and unfathomable. It was as if he was facing heaven and earth.</p><p>Strong. He was definitely an unbelievable expert. His strength had exceeded Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>you don’t have to be surprised. I’m not a human. I’m just a puppet!</p><p>The yellow-skinned man said.</p><p>“A puppet?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The khaki-colored man was actually a puppet. However, it seemed to possess the thoughts and emotions of a human. Moreover, its cultivation was unfathomable. It was actually a puppet.</p><p>What kind of existence? How could he create such a puppet?</p><p>“Senior, may I ask what this place is? How did I end up here?”</p><p>Lu Ming humbly asked for guidance.</p><p>this is Hunyuan sect, Primal Chaos Hall. Also, I’m tu Yi.</p><p>The khaki-colored man explained.</p><p>“Hunyuan sect, it’s the Hunyuan sect again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. In the divine Ruins, he had once heard dandan mention that it was the time and space spiritual Hall, which also belonged to the Hunyuan sect.</p><p>This place was also the Hunyuan sect.</p><p>As expected, the battle of Providence was related to Hunyuan sect!</p><p>“Senior Earth One, could it be that this place is no longer in the primordial realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right, this place is the heaven realm!”</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>“Heaven realm!” Lu Ming was shocked. The primordial chaos token had brought him to the heaven realm.</p><p>“You should have a lot of questions, I can explain to you.”</p><p>you must have obtained a primordial chaos token through the battle of Providence. There aren’t many people who can obtain a primordial chaos token. Only people who are considered to have great potential can obtain a primordial chaos token!</p><p>as for you, you must have cultivated five different elemental heaven and earth intents. Moreover, all five intents have reached the peak of level four. That’s why the primal Chaos token activated and brought you to the primal Chaos Palace!</p><p>here, you will be tested. If you can pass the test, you will be able to obtain the chaos Scripture. You will be able to combine the five intents you have comprehended into one and transform it into the Supreme Chaos intent!</p><p>Earth One explained in detail.</p><p>“Chaos intent? Is there really chaos will in the world?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and his eyes widened.</p><p>He had heard of the chaos will before. It was a supreme will.</p><p>It was said that the world and the universe came from the chaos. The chaos intent realm was an intent realm that transcended time and space.</p><p>If the time and space concepts were the Kings of the concepts, then the chaos concept was the Emperor of the concepts.</p><p>Lu Ming had always thought that the chaos concept was just a legend. He did not expect that such a concept really existed in the world.</p><p>Furthermore, according to tu Yi, as long as Lu Ming passed the test, he would be able to obtain the chaos Scripture and cultivate the chaos concept.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart could not help but beat wildly.</p><p>the chaos Scripture was created by a Supreme expert of the Hunyuan sect back then. One can cultivate the chaos will. After becoming an Emperor, one can transform into the chaos Domain and even the chaos laws. It’s one of the strongest secret Scriptures in the world. However, the conditions to cultivate it are extremely harsh. First, one must cultivate the will of five different attributes to the great circle of level four!</p><p>alright, show me the intent realm you’ve comprehended!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly nodded and unleashed his five intents. A five-colored glow surrounded Lu Ming’s body in a dazzling manner.</p><p>The five intents were able to merge and separate at will. It was extremely profound.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
