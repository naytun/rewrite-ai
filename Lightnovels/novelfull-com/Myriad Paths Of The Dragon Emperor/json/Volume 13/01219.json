Lu Ming only needed to spend some time devouring and refining the rough stone, and his cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the most important thing was to improve his intent realm. As long as he had a rough stone, his cultivation level would increase rapidly.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s greatest opportunity was to get the space-time spirit rat. Now, the space-time spirit rat was hanging onto Lu Ming all day.</p><p>“What an adorable spirit mouse!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up when he saw the space-time spirit mouse. He really wanted to hug it.</p><p>However, the space-time spirit mouse seemed to be shy with strangers. It clung onto Lu Ming and refused to let Xie nianqing hug it. This made Xie nianqing pout.</p><p>“Haha, this little guy!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, causing Xie nianqing’s little mouth to pout even more.</p><p>“Dandan, can you find the way out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked dandan.</p><p>“Cough, cough, I can try!”</p><p>Dandan coughed dryly again and flew onto Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“This fellow, dry coughed again.”</p><p>Lu Ming had a bad premonition. This guy coughed dryly. He was not confident.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the space-time spirit mouse kicked dandan’s face and sent her flying off Lu Ming’s shoulder. Then, it curled up its body and nestled on Lu Ming’s shoulder, looking at dandan with its big eyes.</p><p>It was as if he was saying that this territory was his.</p><p>“Nest, little guy, you dare to kick this Lord, how dare you, impudent!”</p><p>Dandan was furious.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse looked at dandan innocently and made chirping sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing laughed out loud. Even Long Chen, who usually did not smile, smiled.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he thought of something. He touched the space-time spirit mouse and said, ” “Little fellow, are you willing to leave this place with me?”</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse’s nose blistered, and it nodded its head.</p><p>“Then Do You Know the Way out? Can you take us out?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The space-time spirit rat nodded again.</p><p>“Alright, bring us out then!” Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse stretched out its little paw and pointed in a direction. Lu Ming was overjoyed. The few of them followed the direction that the space-time spirit mouse pointed and moved forward.</p><p>The headless true dragon Rider didn’t move at all.</p><p>Soon, they were out of the palace. The space-time spirit rat would give them directions from time to time, so they followed it.</p><p>Just like that, they walked for half a day.</p><p>After half a day, the surrounding environment suddenly changed. They discovered that they had already left the core region and arrived at the divine Ruins ‘inner region.</p><p>They had really walked out of the core region of the divine Ruins.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched the space-time spirit mouse.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The space-time spirit mouse squinted its eyes and curled up its chubby body. It looked very comfortable, and the bubble on its nose was fluctuating.</p><p>“It’s so cute!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were already full of light. He stared at the space-time spirit mouse and wanted to rush up and hug it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this little spirit mouse is much more reliable than your little turtle!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“What? Little girl, what did you say? How can this little guy be compared to me? You …”</p><p>Dandan was so angry that she was trembling. She grabbed Lu Ming’s other shoulder and glared at Xie nianqing. At the same time, she paid close attention to the space-time spirit mouse, afraid that it would kick her down again.</p><p>“Isn’t it?”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted and looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, did you give it a name? In my opinion, why don’t we call it bubbles? it’ll be so cute!”</p><p>Xie nianqing carefully approached and touched the space-time spirit mouse.</p><p>“Be good, paoba, let me hug you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said in a soft and gentle voice.</p><p>This time, the space-time spirit mouse didn’t refuse and let Xie nianqing approach.</p><p>Xie nianqing stroked it a few times, then held the space-time spirit rat in his arms, looking happy.</p><p>“Bubbles, that’s quite fitting!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Everyone’s attention was on bubbles, which made dandan extremely angry.</p><p>let’s go back to the South God Palace. Mu Jue, the MU family, we’ll settle this debt sooner or later!</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The MU family could only secretly send people to deal with them. On the surface, they would never dare to do so. Otherwise, what would the young powerhouses of the other continents think if they knew?</p><p>Therefore, they could just swagger back to the South God Palace.</p><p>In less than an hour, they had returned to the South God Palace.</p><p>The South God Palace was even more lively with people coming and going.</p><p>The young geniuses from the nine southern continents of the divine Ruins continent had all arrived long ago. They had all ended their seclusion and were wandering on the streets.</p><p>That was because there were still two more days before they had to set off for the ancient city of the divine Ruins to participate in the selection of the tianshen sect. Everyone had come out to take a walk and relax.</p><p>“The MU family is holding a stone gambling event!”</p><p>“Oh, really? Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted on the street, and many people immediately gathered in one direction.</p><p>“The stone gambling event?”</p><p>The few of them were stunned. Lu Ming pulled one of them aside and asked him. He then knew what was going on.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent’s greatest feature was the divine Ruins, which were the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines.</p><p>In the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, being able to cut out a peerless treasure made many people very tempted. However, not all Divine Ruins’ ancient mines could cut out treasures. The probability was very low.</p><p>And the major forces of the South God Palace would take out many Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines every once in a while for people to choose at will. Of course, they had to pay raw gemstones.</p><p>“The MU family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile as he, Xie nianqing, and Long Chen followed the crowd.</p><p>Not long after, the group arrived at a large square. At this time, the square was already surrounded by a sea of people.</p><p>On the square, there were many shelves. On the shelves, there were pieces of glistening yellow Divine Ruins ancient mines. At a rough glance, there were thousands of pieces.</p><p>A few thousand seemed like a lot, but it was nothing to a big force.</p><p>How many people were there in a major force? There were people wandering around the divine Ruins every day. After some years of accumulation, having several thousand Divine Ruins ancient mines was normal.</p><p>On one side of the shelf, there was a high platform where some experts of the MU family were sitting. Mu Jue was sitting in the middle.</p><p>To be honest, he had been in a bad mood recently. Because of Lu Ming and Long Chen, the MU family had lost many masters. Some time ago, he was even punished by his father to face the wall. He was only released a few days ago to host the MU family’s stone gambling event today.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
