There was no way to find the pure spirit body.</p><p>...</p><p>I’d better wait outside for news. It’s a waste of time to wander around like this!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming did not stay any longer and flew out of the red fiend mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When he passed by a large Canyon, a few figures rushed out from the canyon and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>Each of them had a violent aura and demonic Qi all over their bodies. They stared at Lu Ming with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>“Haha, another fat sheep. This is already the third one!”</p><p>One of the burly men laughed.</p><p>those people really think that there’s news about pure spirit bodies here, so they ran here with all their might. It’s a good thing for us brothers. If we kill a few more, we can live a few more years of leisure!</p><p>A skinny old man also sneered.</p><p>“No need to talk nonsense with him. Kid, it’s your bad luck to meet us!”</p><p>One of the burly men looked at Lu Ming coldly and walked toward him step by step.</p><p>it seems that you’re not only going to Rob, but also kill!</p><p>Lu Ming said. His voice was calm, without a trace of panic.</p><p>He had already seen through their cultivation. The strongest among them, the burly man, was only at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. Lu Ming did not take him seriously at all.</p><p>that’s right. We won’t kill you. If you spread the news, not only will we not be able to continue, but we will also be surrounded. So, you must die!</p><p>The burly man grinned hideously. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming. A pitch-black saber appeared in his hand. It exuded a cold killing intent as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the next moment, the burly man was stunned, and so were the others.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had only stretched out a palm and gently squeezed the saber. No matter how the burly man tried to unleash his power, he could not pull out the saber. The saber was firmly held by Lu Ming as if it was a rock.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The burly man roared with disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The essential core in Lu Ming’s body exploded. A terrifying force blasted out from his fingers and into the opponent’s saber.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber trembled violently, and the violent power poured into the burly man’s body through the saber. The burly man’s body trembled violently, and he could no longer hold the saber. His body retreated madly, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming suddenly shouted. A terrifying killing intent burst out like a tide. As he took a step forward, his palm was like a knife, slashing at the burly man.</p><p>The terrifying power made the burly man’s heart tremble.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The burly man roared madly and used his Blood Meridian fusion to unleash his full strength, hoping to block Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment they exchanged blows, the burly man’s bloodline and his body were torn into pieces. Even his spiritual God could not escape and was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, ordinary martial artists in the great circle of the spiritual God stage were as weak as babies and could not withstand a single blow.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“Quickly run!”</p><p>The remaining people’s eyes almost popped out when they saw this scene. Then, they screamed in horror and fled in all directions.</p><p>“It’s too late to escape now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and his figure flashed at high speed. Not long after, a series of screams rang out in the forest. The remaining people were all killed by Lu Ming, and all their storage rings fell into his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and left the place. Not long after, Lu Ming left the Red Devil Mountain and sat cross-legged on a not-so-high mountain peak, waiting for news.</p><p>those guys have been killing people for goods. I wonder if they have any good things? ”</p><p>Since he had nothing to do, Lu Ming took out the storage rings of the few people he killed and casually counted them.</p><p>These guys were indeed very rich.</p><p>The raw stones added up to almost fifty million, and there were all kinds of spirit weapons and spirit herbs. It was obvious that these few guys had robbed quite a number of people during this period of time and were extremely rich.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>All of a sudden, a metal box caught Lu Ming’s attention. He opened the metal box and saw a rolled-up drawing inside.</p><p>He did not know what the drawing was made of. It felt light and the texture was very soft. Lu Ming opened it and his eyes narrowed.</p><p>It seemed to be a map. However, the drawing was very complicated. The lines crisscrossed. For a moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were a little blurry.</p><p>“A map? Could it be related to the pure spirit body?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Then, he smiled and shook his head. It could not be such a coincidence that he would get the map of the pure spirit body after killing a gang of bandits.</p><p>“Let’s take some time to study it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and kept the map. He then meditated and adjusted his breathing, waiting quietly.</p><p>Three days passed, and many people came out of Red Devil Mountain. In the past few days, many experts had almost turned red Devil Mountain upside down, but there was no news about the pure spirit body.</p><p>I’m cursing. I’ve probably been played. If this old man finds out who played me, I’ll cut him into eight pieces!</p><p>“Damn it, there’s nothing here. What a waste of time!”</p><p>Some experts cursed and left the Red Devil Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming also left the red fiend mountain and returned to the city.</p><p>When everyone returned to the city, they heard an important piece of news.</p><p>It was said that someone had obtained a map to find a pure spirit body. Through the map, one could find the location of a pure spirit body. There were already many experts chasing after the person who had the map.</p><p>And the direction was all the way South, towards the ocean.</p><p>As soon as the news came out, it caused a commotion. Many experts hurriedly left the city and flew towards the South.</p><p>“A map?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed. He could not help but think of the map that he had obtained from the gang of bandits.</p><p>“There can’t be two maps, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He left the city and headed south.</p><p>Everyone was as fast as lightning. After a long journey, they finally stopped in a swamp.</p><p>There were many people surrounding the swamp.</p><p>“The one who obtained the map was a Supreme martial artist!”</p><p>Someone spread the news, causing most people’s faces to change.</p><p>If a Supreme martial artist obtained the map, who could snatch it from him?</p><p>Any martial artist below the Supreme-being level would be courting death if they went there. It was no wonder that so many people were surrounding the perimeter of the swamp, not daring to enter.</p><p>I know which Supreme-being it is. It should be the hundred poisons Supreme. He obtained the map and escaped into the boundless swamp. There are already Supreme-beings who have entered.</p><p>I heard that the son of the sea-guarding Commander-in-Chief of the South deity Palace led many Supreme martial artists and charged in!</p><p>“It’s definitely going to be a huge battle!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>This news made most of the martial artists stop in their tracks, not daring to enter.</p><p>It was obvious that the boundless swamp would become the battlefield of the Supreme martial artists. If others entered, they would have no hope of obtaining the map. They might even lose their lives.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed into the swamp and disappeared.</p><p>“Who is that? You actually dare to enter?”</p><p>“Nonsense, that’s a Supreme martial artist!”</p><p>“Heavens, another Supreme Being has appeared!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
