Since I’m here, how can I not go? Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Tuoba Shi flew towards the east.</p><p>Along the way, he saw many people flying towards the east.</p><p>For example, the divine wilderness continent’s long Chen, Dark Child, and the others had also headed east.</p><p>On the divine Ruins continent, there were quite a few places in the divine Ruins, and they were all very famous.</p><p>There was only one place near the South God Palace, which was more than 50000 miles to the East of the South God Palace.</p><p>The distance of 50000 li was quickly covered.</p><p>“It’s really wonderful and spectacular!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stood in the air, looking into the distance, full of amazement.</p><p>What came into view was an endless stretch of ruins.</p><p>Yes, it really was a ruin.</p><p>Endless rubble, broken palaces, broken mountains, and broken pavilions were scattered on the vast land in front of him.</p><p>It was as if a rich country had fallen from the sky and smashed into the ground, forming a pile of ruins.</p><p>some people speculate that the divine Ruins is another world. A tragic great battle occurred in another world, space cracked open, and they fell here!</p><p>Tuoba Shi said.</p><p>“Another world? Could it be the heaven realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had once been to a small island in the heaven realm and learned some secrets that were not known to anyone.</p><p>The heaven realm and the primordial realm were twin worlds. Other than these two worlds, no one had heard of any other world.</p><p>Moreover, it seemed that there was a fierce war in the heavenly realm, which was just in line with the situation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another charged into the vast Divine Ruins.</p><p>“Let’s go in and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them also flew towards the divine Ruins.</p><p>The divine Ruins were vast and boundless, occupying an extremely vast area.</p><p>Right now, the location they were in was the divine Ruins ‘periphery.</p><p>Looking up, Lu Ming saw a huge Palace that had fallen to the ground in ruins. It was filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>He also saw a huge ancient city, which was also in ruins and out of shape.</p><p>It’s said that long ago, the divine Ruins ‘periphery also had quite a number of Divine Ruins ancient mines. But so many years have passed, the ancient mines in the divine Ruins’ periphery have long been excavated clean. Only the inner region still has Divine Ruins ancient mines!</p><p>Tuoba Shi said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing nodded. The three of them did not stop and continued flying forward. After a while, the three of them arrived inside the divine Ruins.</p><p>At this point, the three of them landed and did not fly in the sky.</p><p>This was because the inner regions were filled with danger, especially when flying in the air. If one were to encounter danger, one would not be able to avoid it in time.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming also wanted to look around to see if he could find the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>“Why do I feel like I’ve seen this place before?”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes darted around as she mumbled.</p><p>“You’ve really seen it before?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>I think I’ve seen it before, but I can’t remember it clearly. Strange, it seems that the more important the matter is, the more I can’t remember!</p><p>Dandan muttered, as if she was carefully recalling.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Dandan always dropped the ball at the critical moment.</p><p>The three of them reduced their speed and sensed carefully in the ruins to see if they could find the ancient mine in the divine Ruins.</p><p>“What a huge Palace!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked ahead and revealed a look of amazement.</p><p>In front of him was a huge, broken Palace. It was on the ground and looked worn out, but one could tell that it was extremely tall and majestic.</p><p>Lu Ming, I seem to have a trace of feeling. There seems to be a Divine Ruins ancient mine inside!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them carefully rushed into the ruins of the hall and looked around carefully. Finally, they came to a remote corner.</p><p>Xie nianqing sensed that there was something in the corner that was reacting to her.</p><p>“I’ll dig it up!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi took out a huge axe made of vital essence and began to hack at the ground. The soil of the ruins was very hard, so Tuoba Shi had a hard time digging. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing joined in. The three of them worked together and cleared the ruins, digging out a large pit that was dozens of meters deep.</p><p>Sure enough, in the large pit, several pieces of Divine Ruins ancient mines were discovered.</p><p>haha, there are a few Divine Ruins ancient mines here. It’s truly a case of searching high and low, but finding it without any effort at all!</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh was heard.</p><p>With a flash, three figures appeared, looking down at Lu Ming and the other two in the deep pit.</p><p>The three of them were all young men with powerful auras. There was a faint arrogance on their faces.</p><p>“Now, this place belongs to us. The three of you can leave!”</p><p>One of the bald young men said with a commanding tone.</p><p>you three, we found this place first and excavated it with great difficulty. You want us to leave as soon as you come, isn’t that too much? ”</p><p>Said Tuoba Shi.</p><p>These three people were clearly trying to Rob him.</p><p>“Too much? I don’t think that it’s already a great kindness for us to let you leave and spare your lives. Why aren’t you all getting lost quickly? we don’t have so much time to waste here. After excavating these few Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines, we still have to head to other places!”</p><p>The bald youth rebuked coldly.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s face turned dark and he said, ” you want us to leave with just one sentence? what a joke!</p><p>“Brat, you talk too much. You don’t need to leave now!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With that, the bald youth stomped his feet and pounced towards Tuoba Shi like an eagle pouncing on its prey. At the same time, he threw a punch at Tuoba Shi.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>A Mace appeared in Tuoba Shi’s hand. With a loud roar, his aura burst forth and he swung the mace towards his opponent.</p><p>Fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Over the past month, Tuoba Shi’s cultivation had finally broken through and reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bald youth’s fist collided with Tuoba Shi’s Mace.</p><p>With a loud sound, Tuoba Shi’s expression changed drastically. Even with his fourth level spiritual God Realm cultivation, it was difficult for him to withstand the attack. He was sent flying backward and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The bald youth’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness as he threw a punch towards Tuoba Shi’s heart.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>With a loud shout, a force field was formed and enveloped the bald young man, greatly reducing his speed. At the same time, Xie nianqing rushed out and struck out with his palm, which collided with the bald young man’s fist.</p><p>With a loud bang, Xie nianqing and the bald young man retreated at the same time.</p><p>“Little Qing, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>He could tell that the bald youth had an early fifth level spiritual God Realm cultivation, which was slightly stronger than Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing’s combat strength was extremely strong. Even if his cultivation was slightly weaker, he should be able to fight with him.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave this person to me. You have to be careful of the other two!” Xie nianqing shook his head.</p><p>There were three people on the other side, and the remaining two didn’t make a move, but they gave off an even more dangerous feeling.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
