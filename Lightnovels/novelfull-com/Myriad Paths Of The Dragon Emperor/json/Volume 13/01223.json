It took countless years to produce one. Its value was immeasurable, and if used properly, it could unleash a terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that he would find such a treasure in the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>“How is it? Brat, I told you I have a treasure, why Would I Lie to You? How could I have misjudged you?”</p><p>Dandan was very proud of herself, looking as if she was so awesome that she wanted to go to heaven.</p><p>In the crowd, Xie nianqing smiled, while long Chen was a little stunned.</p><p>He realized that he could not see through Lu Ming anymore.</p><p>divine Sun Stone! It’s actually a divine Sun Stone!</p><p>At first, mujue’s eyes were wide open in disbelief and he muttered in a daze. After a while, his eyes emitted an extremely hot flame.</p><p>“Lu Ming, give me the divine Sun Stone!”</p><p>Mu Jue shouted, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the divine Sun Stone into the mountain and river diagram. He then looked at mu Jue as if he was an idiot.</p><p>“Leave it to you? This is mine, and you want me to give it to you? do you want to buy it from me? I’m sorry, but I’m not selling!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>what do you mean by ‘yours’? this is clearly the treasure of my Mu family. If you dare to take my Mu family’s treasure, you better hand it over!</p><p>Mu Jue shouted, his eyes blazing.</p><p>“What an idiot. Your Mu family? It was just now, but now, I’ve already bought it, so it’s mine. Do you think so many people are blind? You can’t see it?”</p><p>Lu Ming mocked.</p><p>what a joke. I told you that it’s enough just now and that you should stop choosing stones. I haven’t agreed to let you continue choosing stones, but you’re the one who wants to choose. This divine Sun Stone naturally still belongs to our Mu family!</p><p>Mujue argued.</p><p>“Then why are you still accepting the one hundred thousand raw stones I paid? Since you’ve taken my raw gemstone, it’s mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>I don’t care. I didn’t agree to it. Hand over the divine Sun Stone. You can’t swallow such a treasure!</p><p>Mu Jue shouted. His voice was cold and revealed a strong sense of threat.</p><p>hahaha, laughable, truly laughable. You guys took out so many Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines and placed them here for people to gamble on stones. Furthermore, each piece was even sold at a high price of 100000 raw stones. Now, seeing someone else cut out a treasure, you want to go back on your word and ask him to hand it over to you.</p><p>alright then, I’ll hand it over to you. How many people have spent money in the stone gambling conventions that your Mu family has held for so many years to buy useless ores? spit out all the money. If you spit it out, I’ll hand it over to you!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Mu Jue was speechless, and his face turned red.</p><p>How many years had it been since the MU family had held stone gambling events? It was impossible to calculate how many raw gemstones they had earned over the years. How could they hand them over?</p><p>“You feel heartache when others earn a little from you, but what about when you earn from others? Why aren’t you spitting it out? what a joke!”</p><p>let me tell you, although your Mu family is powerful, the South God Palace is not your Mu family’s South God Palace. If your Mu family wants to cover the sky with one hand, you’ll have to ask the permission of so many people here!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, he turned around and flew in the direction of Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>The two Mu family experts in front of Lu Ming each stretched out their claws and grabbed at Lu Ming. Both of them were at the peak of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and struck out with his palm. The majestic palm force sent the two Mu family powerhouses flying.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to use force? is this how your Mu family does business? In the future, I don’t think anyone else will need to do business with your Mu family!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Many people looked at the MU family unkindly.</p><p>If the MU family were to do business like this and snatch the treasure that someone else obtained, who would still do business with the MU family in the future? who would still choose the stones when the MU family organized the stone gambling event?</p><p>If he were to cut out a Supreme treasure like Lu Ming, would the MU family not have to take it back?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Mu Jue roared in his heart. He really wanted to get someone to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces but he did not dare to. If he really did that, the MU family’s reputation would be destroyed.</p><p>He could only watch helplessly as Lu Ming left.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming went to Xie nianqing and Long Chen, and the three of them rose into the air and flew in the direction of general peak. After flying for a while, Lu Ming stopped and said, ” Everyone, I can indeed sense the situation inside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines. Therefore, those remaining ancient mines are all scrap mines, without any treasures!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming laughed and left with Xie nianqing and Long Chen.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>Mujue gritted his teeth and shouted Lu Ming’s name. His eyes were red and he was filled with murderous intent. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>After hearing Lu Ming’s words, who else would go up to choose the stones?</p><p>As expected, a wave of discussion immediately broke out around the square.</p><p>there’s none left. The rest are all useless ores!</p><p>Lu Ming must be able to sense the situation of the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine. He said there’s no more, and there’s no more. Woah, there are thousands of Divine Ruins’ ancient mines, but only four have treasures. The MU family is f * cking cheating!</p><p>let’s go. I’m not choosing anymore. It’s all scrap ore. What’s the point of choosing!</p><p>The people in the square shook their heads one by one and then flew in all directions. In a short while, everyone in the square had left, leaving only the MU family.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mujue let out a sound like a wild boar. He was extremely angry.</p><p>This time, the MU family’s stone gambling event had completely collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming had cut out four treasures. Furthermore, no one would buy them anymore. There were so many Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines. It was a huge loss.</p><p>“Lu Ming must die. Damn it. I must find a way to kill him!”</p><p>Mujue roared in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mood was the opposite of his. He was very happy.</p><p>He cut out four treasures, each one more precious than the last, especially the divine Sun Stone, which was simply a priceless treasure.</p><p>He had spent a total of 400000 raw gemstones and obtained four such precious treasures. He had struck it rich.</p><p>Soon, the three of them returned to the general peak.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as they arrived at general peak, Xie nianqing’s eyes looked forward.</p><p>In front of them, Xie nianjun was dressed in a snow-white robe, looking like a fairy from the nine Heavens who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p>Beside Xie nianjun, there was a young man in white. He was extremely handsome, the kind of person who would attract everyone’s attention just by standing in a crowd. He was born to be high and mighty, and everyone looked up to him.</p><p>This was an extraordinary hero. With just one look, Lu Ming could feel a strong pressure from this person. It was a dangerous pressure.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Xie nianjun looked at Xie nianqing, Lu Ming, and the rest. He snorted with disdain and hostility.</p><p>“That woman is your sister?”</p><p>The man in white looked at Xie nianqing and asked Xie nianjun in surprise.</p><p>“It’s just a mutant, there’s no need to pay attention to it!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said. Then, he left general peak with the man in white.</p><p>“Hmph!” Xie nianqing also snorted coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
