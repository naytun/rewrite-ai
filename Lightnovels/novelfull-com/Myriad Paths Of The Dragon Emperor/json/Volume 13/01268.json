After flying for a while, the terrain became more remote.</p><p>...</p><p>“Senior, miss Ji hongchen is staying here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a suspicious look in his eyes.</p><p>“Miss has a courtyard here. The environment is elegant and tranquil. Miss likes to invite distinguished guests here!”</p><p>The old man explained with a kind expression.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and continued to fly forward with the old man.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I feel that something is not right!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hmm, let’s see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After flying for a while, the terrain became even more remote.</p><p>“Senior, please wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>The old man stopped and turned around,”young master Lu, what’s the matter?” We’re almost there.”</p><p>“You weren’t sent by Ji hongchen, were you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he suddenly spoke.</p><p>The old man’s expression suddenly changed. He revealed a mysterious smile and said,”Young master Lu, are you mistaken? I was indeed sent by the young lady.”</p><p>you still dare to lie to me? miss Ji hongchen just sent me a voice transmission saying that he would look for me at the general peak, but he couldn’t find me. If you were sent here by him, why would you personally look for me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically and became extremely gloomy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He slammed his palm towards Lu Ming’s heart. A violent pressure surged towards Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>Great circle of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>This old man had a cultivation base of the great circle of the spiritual God stage. His sudden attack was terrifying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was prepared. The Dragon power in his body burst out and he also struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the two palms met, the old man’s body seemed to have been struck by lightning. One of his arms was directly blown into pieces. He retreated madly and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“Who the hell are you? Who sent you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely gloomy, and a cold killing intent burst out.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, you’re lucky!”</p><p>The old man said with a cold face.</p><p>I’m not lucky. Ji hongchen didn’t look for me at all. I was just spouting nonsense.</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Earlier on, he said that Ji hongchen had gone to look for him, but that didn’t happen at all. He had only wanted to trick the old man. He didn’t expect that this old man really had ulterior motives and that he would be exposed in an instant.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The old man was so angry that he spat out another mouthful of blood. His expression was extremely ugly. He had lived for thousands of years and did not expect to be played by a young man like Lu Ming.</p><p>“Tell me, who sent you here? I’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the old man.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, smoke-like auras rose from all directions. They were extremely terrifying and powerful.</p><p>There were a total of six auras, and each one of them was much stronger than the old man in front of him.</p><p>Supreme. Six Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The space cracked open and six figures stepped out. They surrounded Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, blocking their way out.</p><p>The six figures were all wrapped in black robes, hiding their bodies and faces.</p><p>they really think highly of me. They actually sent six great Supremes!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He was guessing who had such great power.</p><p>This place was the South God Palace. Only the great forces of the South God Palace could send six Supreme martial artists to kill him.</p><p>Was it the MU family or the Wang family?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>……</p><p>The six Supreme martial artists did not waste any time. They attacked immediately. A terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. At the same time, six terrifying attacks fell on the two of them.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed down with both hands, and a terrifying force field spread out in all directions with her as the center.</p><p>As soon as the six great masters entered the sky demon power field, their figures suddenly became sluggish, and their expressions changed slightly.</p><p>With Xie nianqing’s current combat strength, he could already affect a Supreme-being.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as his third bloodline emerged, making him even more powerful. He took a step in the air and instantly approached one of the Supremes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the other party also threw a palm at the same time.</p><p>There was a loud boom. Lu Ming did not move, but the other party’s body trembled violently and was sent flying backward like a cannonball, spewing a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This scene caused the hearts of the others to tremble wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too shocking. With one move, he had injured a Supreme-being. Was this the strength of the first place in the assessment?</p><p>It could also be said that this was the strength of the number one prodigy in the divine Ruins ‘continent?</p><p>“Activate your bloodline and kill him with all your might!”</p><p>A Supreme martial artist spoke. A bloodline appeared above his head as he used bloodline fusion.</p><p>The other five Supreme martial artists also performed bloodline fusion.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>Xie nianqing also performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into a beautiful heavenly demon. The heavenly demon force field was even more terrifying. At the same time, the force field was filled with a powerful destructive force, making it difficult for the six Supreme martial artists to move.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons and pounced toward the six great masters.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With just a single move, a Supreme martial artist was beaten to the point of spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>If the other Supreme-beings had not come to his rescue in time, Lu Ming could have taken the opportunity to kill this Supreme-being.</p><p>A black-robed man stood in the air and looked down at the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming was very familiar with one of the young men. It was young master Lin from the deity sect.</p><p>at this moment, young master Lin’s face was vicious and he looked down with killing intent.</p><p>this kid is really talented. Even in the yuan continent, he’s not bad. It’s a pity that he doesn’t want to join my Tian Shen sect. I can only kill him!</p><p>beside young master Lin was a middle-aged man. He was one of the two middle-aged men from the heaven God sect.</p><p>Hmph, I’ve already found out that my son mujue was killed by this man. He must die!</p><p>Beside the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect, there were two Men in Black robes. One of them spoke coldly.</p><p>At this moment, the battle below was even more intense.</p><p>The six great Supremes worked well together, but Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s combined combat strength was equally shocking. Lu Ming, in particular, was brave and invincible.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the heads of the nine Dragons, a lightning cauldron the size of a mountain appeared and crashed towards one of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Supreme-being was hit so hard that he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His entire body was charred black, and his body almost exploded.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and the devouring power burst out, enveloping the other party. Then, he grabbed out with his claws and grabbed at the other party.</p><p>“No, save me!”</p><p>The Supreme-being screamed in fear. The other Supreme-beings shouted in anger and tried to help. Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron, and thousands of lightning bolts filled the air to block the Supreme-beings.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The nine-Dragon Claw clawed into the Supreme-being’s dantian, and the terrifying power shattered his body and dragged his spirit out.</p><p>The spiritual God had the appearance of an old man. At that moment, his face was filled with endless fear.</p><p>“Spare me …”</p><p>He wanted to beg for mercy, but the Dragon God exploded when the Dragon Claw clenched. A Supreme-being was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength and the lightning cauldron, it would not be too difficult for him to kill an ordinary Supreme-being.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
