A blood-red light pillar shot into the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>It shone with the blood-colored light pillar above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go. Let’s go open that Palace together!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded, and the two of them flew side by side to the nearest Palace.</p><p>Soon, a Palace appeared in their field of vision.</p><p>However, the two of them and the two blood-red light pillars were too eye-catching.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>With a whooshing sound, seven or eight young experts flew over from all directions, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>“Nine for each of you!”</p><p>Some people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the strongest person.</p><p>A fist force streaked across the sky and struck towards that person.</p><p>The terrifying pressure scared the man out of his wits. He tried his best to set up a defense, but in the end, he was still hit by Lu Ming’s punch and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying dozens of miles.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>Everyone recognized the person just now. He was a heaven’s favorite who had set foot on the 36 Phecda peaks. His cultivation was at the peak of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, but he was actually beaten by Lu Ming to the point of spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. This made everyone extremely frightened.</p><p>“A monster, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The rest of the people scattered and fled, wishing they had two more legs.</p><p>Not long after, not a single one of them was left.</p><p>Lu Ming couldn’t be bothered and went to the hall with Xie nianqing.</p><p>There was also a stone tablet in front of the palace’s door. There were nine keyholes on the stone tablet.</p><p>“Little Qing, you first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. With a thought, nine blood-colored keys flew into the keyhole, and the door opened.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll go in first and wait for you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>I don’t know if two people can enter in succession. You go in first. If I don’t, it means that I went to another Hall. You don’t have to wait for me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and stepped through the door. After Xie nianqing stepped in, the door closed automatically.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s still useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and the nine keys flew toward the nine keyholes. Unfortunately, the nine keys stopped outside and could not enter at all.</p><p>it’s indeed useless. Only one person can enter one Palace at a time!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and left. Not long after, he found another Hall. There was obviously no one in this Hall. Lu Ming used nine keys to open the door of the hall and stepped in.</p><p>The scene inside the palace was almost the same as the last time he saw it.</p><p>There were also a few shelves. On the shelves, there were balls of light. Under the balls of light, there were different symbols.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully, thinking about what to choose.</p><p>For the martial techniques of creation, he had the Thundergod strike for the time being. If he chose another one, he would have no time to practice it.</p><p>One Thundergod strike was enough for Lu Ming to comprehend. If he could cultivate Thundergod strike to the highest level, its power would be shocking. It would be enough for the time being.</p><p>Learning one more wouldn’t be of much use.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while and decided to choose a type of pill.</p><p>If it could be placed together with martial techniques of creation, it would presumably not be bad.</p><p>However, the pill symbols all looked the same. It was impossible to distinguish what kind of pill it was, so he could only choose at will.</p><p>Lu Ming casually grabbed one of the light orbs. The light orbs shattered and a Jade bottle appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Domain solidifying pill!”</p><p>On the Jade bottle, there was a label with three words written on it.</p><p>“It’s actually a domain solidifying pill?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery glow and his heart could not help but beat wildly.</p><p>He had heard of the domain solidifying pill before, but it did not exist in the divine wilderness continent. It was only a legend.</p><p>If a great circle spiritual God wanted to advance another step, he would have to transform his intent into a domain.</p><p>However, this step was undoubtedly extremely difficult, astonishingly difficult.</p><p>If one could condense an embryonic stage domain, they would be considered Supreme martial artists.</p><p>However, if a great circle spiritual God consumed the domain solidifying pill, it would greatly increase the chances of strengthening the embryonic form of a domain and even make it easier to form a complete domain.</p><p>This was a priceless treasure, and its value was incalculable.</p><p>The tianshen sect was indeed a major power in the yuan continent. They could even casually take out the domain solidifying pill as a reward.</p><p>Or perhaps, in the eyes of the heavenly God sect, a peerless divine pill like the domain solidifying pill was only rare and ordinary!</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, it was definitely a Supreme divine pill.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation level reached the great circle of the spiritual God stage, this domain solidifying pill would help him to quickly reach the Supreme-level.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it carefully and tried to open the other orbs. Indeed, none of them could be opened.</p><p>“I’m going to see little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He left the hall and went to the hall that Xie nianqing had entered.</p><p>However, the door to Xie nianqing’s Palace was closed, and he didn’t come out.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped at a nearby mountain peak and asked dandan to keep an eye on him from the outside. He entered the mountain and river diagram and sat under the path-understanding ancient tree to comprehend the Thundergod strike.</p><p>In this small world, the slaughter continued. One by one, the top geniuses of their respective continents were killed here, and they would forever remain in this land.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones didn’t even dare to show their faces and looked for a safe place to hide. As for the stronger ones, they hunted everywhere.</p><p>It was a scene of blood and slaughter.</p><p>In a Valley, Long Chen transformed into an Archean dragonesque elephant and howled at the sky. He took a step forward and killed two seventh level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>Now, Long Chen’s cultivation had also entered the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, and his combat strength was even more terrifying.</p><p>After that, Long Chen gathered all nine keys and stepped into a Palace.</p><p>On a large river, the Ice Dragon waved his hand and sealed a few young experts in ice. He also gathered nine keys and entered a Palace.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s body was Holy and pure, and a milky white light filled the air. Nine keys were floating above her head.</p><p>Not far away from her was the three strongest heaven’s favorites of the South God Palace, Wang Zhen.</p><p>miss nianjun, you can go in first. I’ll go to another Hall!</p><p>Wang Zhen said.</p><p>“Many thanks, young master Wang!”</p><p>Xie nianjun nodded and stepped into a Palace.</p><p>Wang Zhen’s eyes glowed with a fiery light as he walked towards the other palaces.</p><p>Such scenes were happening all over the small world.top geniuses like Ji hongchen had all gathered nine keys and entered the palace to obtain their own opportunities.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed. Half a month’s time was almost up.</p><p>After seven days of comprehension, the Thundergod strike had made great progress, but it would still take some time to cultivate to the second level.</p><p>At this moment, they received news that Xie nianqing had come out.</p><p>Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and saw Xie nianqing standing in front of the hall, looking around.</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled when he saw Lu Ming flying over.</p><p>“Little Qing, what did you get?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s a pill!”</p><p>Xie nianqing explained that she had obtained the inheritance of a Supreme powerhouse in the divine Ruins. There were a few martial techniques related to the demonic Dao intent.</p><p>Therefore, Xie nianqing didn’t need to choose a technique of creation. Instead, he chose the pill.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
