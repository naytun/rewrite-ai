You can go in. As long as you successfully cultivate the chaos Scripture, you can leave this place. However, you’ve already successfully fused five martial arts techniques of intent. I believe that cultivating the chaos Scripture shouldn’t be too difficult!”</p><p>...</p><p>Tu Yidao pointed to a stone door behind the fighting ring.</p><p>“Many thanks to all the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and walked towards the stone door.</p><p>The stone door was closed. However, after Lu Ming walked in, the stone door opened automatically.</p><p>Behind the stone door, it was misty and blurry. Lu Ming stepped in without hesitation.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked through the stone door, it closed on its own.</p><p>Behind the stone door was a huge stone room. Above the stone room, there was a figure sitting cross-legged in the air.</p><p>This figure was not very burly or tall, but it gave people the feeling that it was as tall as the sky. It was the most burly figure in the world, able to support the sky and earth.</p><p>The aura was so mysterious that it was more unfathomable than any other expert that Lu Ming had encountered in the past. Lu Ming felt as if he was facing the entire universe when he faced this figure.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was faced with the Saint heart left behind by the mysterious sky Saint, he was already shocked by the vast aura of the other party. However, he now felt that the mysterious sky Saint was like an ant or a speck of dust in front of this figure.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that he had stopped breathing.</p><p>This figure was completely shrouded in the light of chaos. Its appearance could not be seen clearly, only a blurry figure.</p><p>could this be the primal Chaos Emperor? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He was too powerful. The realm of the chaos Thearch had reached a level that Lu Ming could not imagine.</p><p>However, such an expert had already fallen.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard from tu Yi that the chaos Thearch had fallen. That was why he was looking for an inheritor.</p><p>How could such a powerful existence fall? What kind of enemy was he facing?</p><p>Lu Ming could not imagine it.</p><p>Could it be that this figure before him was just a wisp of the primal Chaos Emperor’s imprint?</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed.</p><p>“I am the chaos Scripture!”</p><p>Suddenly, the figure spoke. His voice was calm and soothing to the ears.</p><p>“The chaos Scripture? This figure is the chaos Scripture?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He had never expected that the chaos Scripture would actually take the form of a human and emit a vast and unpredictable aura.</p><p>I was left behind by the primal Chaos Emperor to wait for his successor. After so many years, someone has finally made it here. My mission is complete!</p><p>The chaos Scripture opened its mouth. After it finished speaking, it turned into a ray of light and flew toward the area between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. It entered the area between his eyebrows.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming felt that there was a lot of information in his mind.</p><p>the chaos Scripture, the cultivation method of the chaos will, the chaos Domain, and even the cultivation method of the chaos law, and the corresponding martial techniques of will and domain …</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and observed carefully.</p><p>“It’s too mysterious, it’s really too mysterious.”</p><p>The more he read, the more excited Lu Ming was.</p><p>no, I can’t see the rest now. I won’t understand it even if I see it. Now, I need to turn my five kinds of intent into chaos intent!</p><p>Lu Ming gathered his thoughts and began to read the beginning of the chaos Scripture, which was also the most basic part, to cultivate the chaos concept.</p><p>The chaos will was to transform five or more wills of completely different attributes into the chaos will.</p><p>The chaos will was extremely mysterious. It was the beginning of all wills in the world. After successfully cultivating the chaos will, it could even transform into other wills.</p><p>For example, after successfully cultivating the chaos intent, one could turn it into slaughter intent, destruction intent, blood intent, Thunder intent, and so on.</p><p>Only the chaos intent could not convert the strongest intent, such as time intent and space intent.</p><p>After Lu Ming read through the chaos Scripture in detail, he sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had already fused five types of martial arts techniques into one. Therefore, it was not difficult for him to cultivate the chaos Scripture now. It could be said that the previous trials and tests had already paved the way for him to cultivate the chaos will.</p><p>Three days later, the five-colored will surrounded Lu Ming and it was getting a little heated.</p><p>Seven days later, the colors of the five-colored essence realm had become a little blurry.</p><p>Half a month later, the five intents were already completely intertwined together, and the original color could no longer be seen.</p><p>Two months later, Lu Ming’s surroundings were misty and chaotic.</p><p>The original five concepts disappeared and were replaced by an even more mysterious and Supreme concept that bloomed on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally succeeded in cultivating the chaos concept, the Emperor of the concept.</p><p>Moreover, it was also a class 4 Grand completion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a finger that was wrapped in the chaos concept. He pointed at the space and the space rippled like water.</p><p>It should be known that this was the heaven realm, and the space was very stable, far more stable than the divine Ruins ‘continents. Previously, Lu Ming could not tear the space even when he used his full strength. But now, with just a light touch, the space rippled.</p><p>“The power is too shocking. With my current cultivation and chaos will, I should be able to fight against an Emperor, right? He can even suppress emperors.”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess. There was a shocking fluctuation in his eyes. It was confidence, an extremely strong confidence.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm, but he was confident that he could fight an Emperor, or even suppress one. If others were to know about this, they would probably laugh at Lu Ming for being a lunatic.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had this feeling now.</p><p>In the past, he had to rely on the Thunder cauldron, or even the help of dandan, bubbles, and the rest to fight against the Emperor. However, now, Lu Ming was confident that he could suppress the Emperor without the help of the Thunder cauldron, dandan, bubbles, and the rest.</p><p>“I wonder how little Qing is doing? I’ve been here for more than three years, but only a while has passed in the outside world. Little official, you’re in my mountain and river diagram. I wonder if your time is in sync with mine?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. Then, the space between his eyebrows glowed and the mountain and river diagram appeared. Lu Ming moved and appeared inside the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, Xie nianqing appeared in front of him, glaring at him with resentment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened? Why haven’t you come to see me in three years?”</p><p>Xie nianqing glared at Lu Ming with hatred, but deep in his eyes, there was a strong sense of longing.</p><p>more than three years. Is the time inside the mountain and river diagram the same as mine? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Little Qing, it’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming explained the situation in detail.</p><p>“It’s actually like this …”</p><p>After hearing this, Xie nianqing was amazed.</p><p>“Little Qing, your cultivation has improved a lot!”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned with his spiritual senses and discovered that Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm. Like Lu Ming, he was only one step away from the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Hmph, of course. I’m bored by myself, so I’ve been training hard. In three years, I’ve naturally made rapid progress!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“I’m sorry, little Qing!”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming hugged Xie nianqing tightly in his arms.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
