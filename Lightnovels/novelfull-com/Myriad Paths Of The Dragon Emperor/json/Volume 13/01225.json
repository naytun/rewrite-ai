This was truly shocking.</p><p>...</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was undoubtedly the number one continent in the divine Ruins continent group. The number of heaven’s favorites was shocking, and the South God Palace was only one of the four major forces.</p><p>With so many heaven’s favorites, one could only imagine how terrifying the top three were.</p><p>When the South God Palace’s paragons arrived, a loud and clear cry rang out from the horizon. One after another, huge beasts flew over.</p><p>They were flying leopards. Their bodies were pitch-black, but they had fleshy wings. Their wingspans were more than 100 meters wide. There were at least 20 huge flying leopards, and each of them had a powerful aura, giving people a strong sense of pressure.</p><p>Great circle of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>The twenty plus flying leopards were all at the great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>A black-robed middle-aged man stood on the flying leopard at the front. He was the one who had brought Lu Ming and the others to the divine wilderness continent back then. He was a third level martial Royal realm elder of the South God Palace.</p><p>Behind him stood two old men. They exuded the might of an Emperor, but their status was obviously lower than the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>All of you, board the flying leopard and follow me to the ancient Divine Ruins city!</p><p>A deep voice came out of the black-robed middle-aged man’s mouth.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The first to respond were the South God Palace’s paragons. One by one, they rose into the air and flew onto different flying leopards.</p><p>Following that, the heaven’s favorites from the other continents also took to the air and flew towards the Leopards.</p><p>Lu Ming and the people from the divine wilderness continent were gathered on a flying leopard.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man announced, and over twenty flying leopards roared loudly. They soared straight into the sky and flew into the green nether. Then, like black Lightning, they headed towards the ancient city of the divine Ruins at an astonishing speed.</p><p>One could only imagine the speed of a great circle spirit God flying demonic beast.</p><p>However, the ancient city of the divine Ruins was in the middle of the South God Palace. Even with the flying leopard’s speed, it would still need two days.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood side by side, looking down at the millions of miles of mountains and rivers that flashed past.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there are people from two continents who have been watching us!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yes, I saw it too!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and looked to the left.</p><p>On one of the Leopards, there were many young men in feather clothing. Regardless of whether they were men or women, they all had sharp gazes and a large number of people. There were more than forty of them, and this was the continent with the most people in the other nine Continents apart from the South God Palace.</p><p>“Mujue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold because he saw mu Jue’s figure among these people.</p><p>At this moment, mu Jue was also looking at Lu Ming and the rest coldly.</p><p>“Brother mu, are those the people who offended you?”</p><p>One of the young men in feather clothes looked at Lu Ming and said indifferently.</p><p>that’s right. It’s them. Especially that Lu Ming. I must kill him!</p><p>Mujue’s voice was filled with hatred.</p><p>he’s just a piece of trash from the divine wilderness continent. Don’t worry, if there’s a chance, we will get rid of him. That woman, on the other hand, is not bad. We can keep her and enjoy her!</p><p>The young man in feather clothes said indifferently as if killing Lu Ming was as easy as eating and drinking to them. He did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to learn from brother Yu!”</p><p>Mu Jue was overjoyed.</p><p>At the same time, on the other flying leopard, there were also some young men who were looking at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming even recognized a few of them. They were the few geniuses who had fought to a draw with the continent that Lu Ming had defeated in the divine Ruins.</p><p>“You guys were defeated by that person?”</p><p>A Young heaven’s pride expert who fought to a draw with the continent asked indifferently.</p><p>“Yes, this person’s combat strength is not bad …”</p><p>One of the young men who had been defeated by Lu Ming replied.</p><p>“What do you mean by” pretty good “? What’s so good about a piece of trash from the divine wilderness continent? you’re all just trash!”</p><p>The young man berated them coldly. The few young men who were defeated by Lu Ming blushed and did not know what to say.</p><p>however, no matter what, you’re all people who fought to a draw with the continent. You clearly know that you’re people who fought to a draw with the continent, yet you still dared to attack. I’ll remember this debt. Those few people, when I see them, I’ll kill them in passing!</p><p>The young man said. He had short hair and seemed very confident.</p><p>……</p><p>On the flying leopard that Lu Ming was on, Long Chen walked toward the two of them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful. The people from the White Feather continent and the ping Ping continent have their eyes on us!”</p><p>Long Chen reminded.</p><p>“The White Feather continent, which is ranked fourth in the continent group of the divine Ruins, and the tie continent, which is ranked ninth? If they don’t know what’s good for them, then we can only send them on their way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes lit up. He nodded and turned to leave without saying anything.</p><p>Billions of miles of mountains and rivers flashed by, and in the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>In front of them, an ancient city even more magnificent than the South God Palace appeared.</p><p>This was the ancient city of the divine Ruins, the most majestic and ancient city in the continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>In the divine Ruins continent, the four great forces were the four great divine palaces of the East, West, South, and North. In fact, in the distant past, the four great divine palaces all belonged to one force, which was the gate of God.</p><p>The ancient city of the divine Ruins was the headquarters of the gate of God.</p><p>But now, the four great divine palaces dominated, and the gate of God was equivalent to being divided into four. No power could occupy the ancient city of the divine Ruins for their own use. Therefore, it caused the ancient city of the divine Ruins to be very special, becoming a city shared by the four great divine palaces. Usually, they would station some people here, and once the four great divine palaces had any major matters, they would discuss it in the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>The flying leopard did not stop and directly flew towards the ancient Divine Ruins city, flying towards the central region of the ancient Divine Ruins city.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>When they arrived at the center of the ancient city of the divine Ruins, Lu Ming saw that there were thirty-six tall and Straight Mountain peaks that pierced into the sky, forming a formation of thirty-six celestial dippers.</p><p>In the sky above the 36 mountains, there were nine ancient altars. They were floating in the air and were filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>At this time, the surroundings of the 36 mountain peaks were long surrounded by people. They were all the divine Ruins ancient city’s native martial artists.</p><p>it’s the South God Palace! The heaven’s favorites from the South God Palace and the nine southern continents have arrived!</p><p>A native warrior of the ancient city of the divine Ruins said.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>From the West, the roars of beasts could be heard. Giant tigers with wings on their backs carried many Young heaven’s favorites as they flew over.</p><p>“The heaven’s favorites from the Western deity Palace and the nine Continents have arrived!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“The Western deity Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the West.</p><p>On the giant tigers, there were also many young geniuses. They were also looking at them with sharp eyes.</p><p>“Hahaha, you guys are early!”</p><p>A burst of laughter came from the East.</p><p>One after another, fiery red godly Eagles flew over. The leader was a red-robed middle-aged man. His aura was overbearing, and he was not inferior to the black-robed middle-aged man from the South God Palace.</p><p>On the fiery red godly Eagles, there were also many Young heaven’s favorites. In terms of numbers, they were more than the South God Palace and the West God Palace.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the eastern God Palace and the 11 continents in the East have arrived.</p><p>whoosh …</p><p>At this time, the sound of swords rang out. In the North, dozens of astonishing sword lights appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
