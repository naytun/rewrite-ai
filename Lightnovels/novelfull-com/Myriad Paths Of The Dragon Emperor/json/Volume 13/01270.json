It was extremely mysterious. The two combined without any warning. There was no way to avoid it. By the time mu ye reacted, it was already too late.</p><p>The space mentality was still okay, but the time mentality was really too mysterious.</p><p>The bubble was still small and couldn’t fully display the profoundness of time concept. It could only use a method like time stop to confine the enemy. If the enemy’s cultivation was too strong, it could also be broken.</p><p>It was said that when the time intent realm reached a profound level, it could reverse time. In an instant, it could make a peerless expert return to their childhood, back to the time when they had yet to cultivate, where they could be slaughtered at will.</p><p>Or, it could accelerate time and make a peerless expert reach the end of his life in an instant.</p><p>At that stage, it was hard to imagine how terrifying the power would be.</p><p>Mu ye was enveloped by the transparent bubble, and his figure was instantly fixed in place.</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>die! mu ye roared. His Emperor cultivation erupted as his true essence boiled like a raging flame.</p><p>The transparent bubble was shaking violently, as if it would burst at any moment.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles chirped and continuously clawed at the void with her two small claws. Suddenly, an astonishing scene appeared. The void in all directions shattered like glass, turning into pieces of crystal. Then, a few space blades condensed and slashed toward mu ye.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and dandan’s attacks arrived.</p><p>The moment mu ye broke the transparent bubble, four terrifying attacks landed on mu ye’s body.</p><p>At the critical moment, mu ye used his domain to cover his entire body. At the same time, he circulated his true Yuan, forming a true Yuan armor and wearing it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The first attack was dandan’s attack.</p><p>Since dandan had swallowed a ten thousand spirit crystal last time, she had been recovering rapidly, and her strength had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>The world of the mouth was an innate magical power. It was like a real world that enveloped mu ye. The power of the world constantly eroded mu ye’s territory power and true essence power.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The second attack was Xie nianqing’s demonic light. The demonic light was like a sword that could destroy everything. Combined with the power of the world, it shook mu ye’s realm power and caused it to shake wildly.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Finally, there was a cracking sound, like glass breaking.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s lightning cauldron arrived with a loud bang. Thousands of lightning bolts completely drowned mu ye. The endless power of lightning was like poisonous snakes, drilling toward mu ye.</p><p>With a bang, mu ye’s territory power was completely shattered. The attacks of the three continued to bombard mu ye’s true Energy Armor.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles ‘spatial blade arrived and broke through mu ye’s quintessential essence armor, blasting towards his physical body.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Each of the four attacks caused mu ye’s body to shake violently. He retreated continuously and finally spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The Emperor was injured!</p><p>An Emperor was actually injured by Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and his two little pets. If this were to spread, no one would believe it. They would think it was a joke.</p><p>But now, it had really happened.</p><p>“Is this the spirit body of an Emperor? He’s really powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was a little dissatisfied with such a result.</p><p>Not only did emperors comprehend the power of a realm, but their bodies had also become spiritual.</p><p>A spirit body, be it in terms of attack, defense, or vitality, was terrifyingly high. It had completely transcended the mortal body and reached another realm.</p><p>The four people’s attacks broke through mu ye’s domain and true origin power, directly attacking mu ye’s body. However, they only managed to push mu ye back and cause him some light injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat dissatisfied, but mu ye was about to go crazy.</p><p>He was an Emperor, but not only was he unable to take down a few juniors, he was even forced to retreat and even injured by them. This was a great humiliation. If word of this got out, he would become a laughingstock among the emperors.</p><p>Moreover, the master of the MU family and the powerhouses of the tianshen sect were watching from the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, his killing intent was incomparably cold. He decided that he would no longer care about the lives of Lu Ming and the others. He had to take them down.</p><p>However, the next moment, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared and enveloped him, making him stop in the air.</p><p>Then, another four attacks came crashing down on his face.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A burst of explosions rang out, and mu ye’s body trembled again. He was forced back and spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was injured again, just like the last time. Although it was only a light injury, it made him go crazy.</p><p>”</p><p>He roared madly in his heart, and his eyes were red.</p><p>Aggrieved, he was really aggrieved.</p><p>He was an Emperor and was very powerful. However, he could not even retaliate against Lu Ming and the rest. The transparent bubble was silent and without any warning. When he was about to retaliate, it appeared suddenly.</p><p>He was so aggrieved that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Then, he was enveloped by a transparent bubble.</p><p>He simply wanted to raise his head and roar at the sky. How could he play like this?</p><p>“Hmph, what a piece of trash. You even need me to personally take action!”</p><p>In the sky, the MU family’s master’s expression was unsightly. He coldly snorted and took a step forward.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A huge foot suddenly appeared in the air and stomped down on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned ugly. The power contained in this giant foot was too shocking and terrifying. Lu Ming felt that he could not resist it.</p><p>Lu Ming had once felt this feeling from the black-robed middle-aged man in the South God Palace.</p><p>It was the aura of a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>There was a huge gap between each level of the Martial Emperor realm. Mu ye was only at the first level of the Martial Emperor realm. The difference between him and the third level was too great.</p><p>I’m finished. I’m finished. Lu Ming, who exactly did you offend? ”</p><p>Dandan wailed.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression was also extremely ugly.</p><p>They did not even have the power to fight back against a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Bubbles ‘spacetime imprisonment was useless against such an expert. The difference was too great.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At this moment, the bubble cried out as its chubby body emitted a dazzling light. It waved its claws and a passageway suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p>It was a tunnel filled with the concepts of time and space. It was a spacetime tunnel.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles shouted and charged in first.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing and rushed into the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>As soon as he entered the passage, Lu Ming felt that the surrounding environment was changing rapidly. In a flash, the world had changed.</p><p>The surrounding environment was changing, and they were currently heading towards the divine Ruins.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The giant foot stomped down and the space-time Tunnel collapsed. However, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest were nowhere to be seen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
