He continued to devour the refined raw stone.</p><p>...</p><p>His current intent realm cultivation was enough to support his cultivation level to soar.</p><p>Piles of raw gemstones were continuously refined and transformed into Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>Early sixth level spiritual God Realm, middle sixth level spiritual God Realm, late sixth level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was increasing at an alarming rate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed. On the seventh day, Lu Ming’s aura had reached an unprecedented height.</p><p>Seventh level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm in one go!</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and felt the essential core in his body, which was ten times stronger than before. A smile appeared on his face.</p><p>His current combat strength was much stronger than it was seven days ago.</p><p>Right now, the stronger his cultivation, the stronger his true essence, and the more power he could unleash from the prison suppressing heavenly art, the more his battle power would increase.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward, standing in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing also stood up and smiled.</p><p>In just seven days, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had actually increased by two levels, from the early stage of the sixth level spiritual God Realm to the late stage. The speed was also shocking.</p><p>Xie nianqing had just received the inheritance of an unparalleled existence. During this period of time, her cultivation was in a period of explosive growth. As she understood more about the inheritance, her cultivation would continue to improve.</p><p>“It’s time, let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his eyes filled with confidence.</p><p>The two of them exited the mountain and river diagram. Sure enough, everyone had already begun to gather.</p><p>In a courtyard, many geniuses of the South God Palace were gathered. Above them was the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s expression was very heavy.”This time, the heaven’s pride experts from the other three sides are all astonishingly strong. You must work hard. Once you are selected by the deity sect and become a disciple of the deity sect, not only will you be able to cultivate in the deity sect, but the South deity Palace will also reward you handsomely. So, you must do your best!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Alright, follow me!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man nodded and led the group into the air. Not long after, they arrived near the 36 Phecda peaks.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In the sky, the sound of air being torn rang out continuously. The other three heaven’s favorites had arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, with a flash of light, the silver-haired elder of the heaven God sect and the others appeared above the 36 mountains.</p><p>The silver-haired old man swept his gaze around and said, ” this time, the first round will be held in a small dimension. There are no rules in there. You can use any means. Your mission is to stay in that dimension for fifteen days. Those who can stay for fifteen days will be able to enter the next round!</p><p>as long as I can stay for 15 days, I can enter the next round? ”</p><p>Many people were surprised.</p><p>This sounded very simple.</p><p>If he could stay for 15 days, wouldn’t he be able to enter the next round after finding a place to hide?</p><p>“It shouldn’t be that simple,” many people thought.</p><p>also, in this small plane, there are some opportunities distributed. I can tell you that these opportunities are very rare in the continent group of the divine Ruins, and they can greatly increase your strength!</p><p>The silver-haired old man said, his voice full of temptation.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. This was an opportunity placed by the heavenly Divine sect. How valuable would it be?</p><p>of course, if you want to get these opportunities, you need keys, and the keys are with each and every one of you!</p><p>The silver-haired old man continued.</p><p>“You need a key? The key is with all of us?”</p><p>Many people were very surprised and had a face full of doubt.</p><p>However, the silver-haired old man obviously did not want to explain. An earth-shaking aura burst out from his body. The aura was so strong that even the black-robed middle-aged man, who was a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert, was shocked.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The silver-haired old man waved his hand, and a huge door of light appeared in the air.</p><p>“You all, enter from here!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, some people rushed into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>The silver-haired old man had said that there was a great opportunity inside. If they entered first, wouldn’t they have a higher chance of obtaining the great opportunity?</p><p>“Charge, charge, charge!”</p><p>One after another, young figures rushed into the light door.</p><p>“Little Qing, be careful after you enter!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s small hand.</p><p>“I will, you too!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. Then, the two of them stepped into the air and rushed into the door of light. The next moment, the surrounding environment suddenly changed. Lu Ming found himself in the mountains.</p><p>There was no one in the surroundings.</p><p>As expected, he had entered this place randomly. He and Xie nianqing had separated.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message to Xie nianqing. Unfortunately, the message could not be sent out.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed that his spine was slightly hot and there were wisps of blood Qi spreading out.</p><p>The blood Qi gathered above Lu Ming’s head and finally formed a blood-colored key.</p><p>“Key? That silver-haired old man said that the key is with each of us. Could he be referring to this key?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Perhaps, there would be one above everyone’s head!</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and soared into the sky.</p><p>“Eh? Who is that?”</p><p>After flying for a while, Lu Ming saw a Hall floating in the sky.</p><p>There was a floating palace here. Lu Ming was very curious and flew up.</p><p>The palace’s door was tightly shut, and in front of the door, there were two young men.</p><p>“Sure enough, there is a blood-colored key in each of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a key floating above the two young men’s heads.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>One of the young men punched the door of the palace heavily. However, the door did not move at all. Instead, the young man himself was pushed back by the force of the impact.</p><p>“I can’t break it at all, I’ve tried it before!”</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them had also noticed Lu Ming and they looked at him.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped not far away and carefully sized up the hall.</p><p>It was unknown what material the palace was made of. The youth who attacked just now had a very strong cultivation, reaching the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm. However, he still couldn’t break it open.</p><p>“There are nine small holes there. Could they be the keyholes?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked at a stone tablet beside the door. There were nine small holes on the stone tablet that were arranged in a wonderful shape.</p><p>The other two young men’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>nine small holes. Do I need nine people and nine keys to open it? ”</p><p>One of the black-robed youths guessed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the youth in the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm pounced toward the black-robed youth like lightning. A blade light condensed in his hand and slashed toward the black-robed youth.</p><p>“You … What are you doing?”</p><p>The black-robed young man was shocked and hurriedly tried to block it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
