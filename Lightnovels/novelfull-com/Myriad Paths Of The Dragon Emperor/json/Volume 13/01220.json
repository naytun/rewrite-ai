Otherwise, I’d have put you in a dilemma. Also, it’s a pity for that Xie nianqing, such a beauty!</p><p>...</p><p>Mujue thought to himself. As more and more people gathered in the square, he felt that it was about time. He stood up, looked around, and said, ” today, the MU family is holding a stone gambling event and we’ve taken out all the ancient mines that we’ve been collecting for decades. There must be some rare treasures inside!</p><p>if you want to bet on stones, you can come up and pick carefully. Feel it carefully. The chosen one can take away one hundred thousand raw stones!</p><p>Mujue announced the rules of stone gambling.</p><p>“A hundred thousand raw stones, that’s really expensive!”</p><p>Some people gasped.</p><p>it’s indeed expensive. It wasn’t as expensive when other families held stone gambling events in the past!</p><p>too expensive! Normally, it’s not that expensive to buy Divine Ruins ancient mines!</p><p>Many people began to discuss, and for a moment, no one went up.</p><p>Actually, many people were clear in their hearts that the divine Ruins ancient mines that these major families took out had all gone through heavy screening. The divine Ruins ancient mines that might have treasures appearing had long been screened out.</p><p>Those that could be taken out were all carefully selected, so the chances of obtaining a treasure were not high. It was too expensive to sell one hundred thousand raw stones at this price.</p><p>Mu Jue’s face turned slightly cold and he said, ” normally, when buying Divine Ruins ancient mines, I can’t let you choose carefully and sense it carefully. But now, I can. Furthermore, I guarantee that these Divine Ruins ancient mines are all premium goods. I guarantee it on the MU family’s reputation!</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>“I’ll try it too!”</p><p>As soon as mujue finished speaking, a few burly men stepped forward and carefully selected the raw stones from the thousands.</p><p>After a long while, the few big men had finished choosing and each paid a hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The few burly men nodded.</p><p>When the first two burly men cut open the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, there was nothing inside. When the third burly man cut open the divine Ruins’ ancient mine, a rainbow light shot out from it.</p><p>“A treasure has appeared, a treasure has appeared!”</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar as they watched with wide eyes.</p><p>a Jade sword! Heavens, it’s so powerful!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Inside the divine Ruins ancient mine that the burly man cut open was actually a small and exquisite Jade sword, emitting terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>Although countless years had passed and its essence had been lost, it would still be a terrifying divine weapon as long as it was nurtured properly.</p><p>“This seems to be an Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed, causing the crowd to go into a frenzy.</p><p>there really is a treasure. Mujue was right. This batch of old mines is really good!</p><p>this Jade sword is worth at least tens of millions of raw stones. It might even be worth more than that. A hundred thousand raw stones for tens of millions of raw stones. It’s a profit, a big profit!</p><p>Seeing that Jade sword, many people’s eyes emitted a fiery light.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The burly man quickly put away the Jade sword and left the place.</p><p>it’s only a hundred thousand raw stones. It’ll be worth it if we manage to win!</p><p>“Yes, we’ll take a gamble!”</p><p>At this time, many people were moved. They walked to the square and began to sense carefully. Then, they each chose an ancient mine in the divine Ruins.</p><p>Of course, every piece of Divine Ruins ancient mine had to pay 100 thousand raw stones.</p><p>Soon, there were dozens of people who had chosen dozens of old mines.</p><p>Mujue smiled.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Immediately, those who had chosen the old mine cut it open. Unfortunately, none of the dozens of people present found any treasures.</p><p>what bad luck! I’ve wasted a hundred thousand raw stones!</p><p>“Damn it, if others can pick it, how can I not? damn it, again!”</p><p>Some people were ruthless and picked a few pieces in a row, but they found nothing.</p><p>“That burly man is most likely a drag!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were mixed in the crowd. At this moment, Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Long Chen both nodded.</p><p>It was highly possible that the few burly men at the beginning were cooperating with the MU family to put on a show to stimulate others to go up and choose.</p><p>In just a few moments, he had sold dozens of old mines and earned millions of raw stones. It was a free profit.</p><p>Slowly, the number of people going up decreased, but there were still people who went up to try their luck. In the end, they found nothing.</p><p>“Dandan, you can sense the treasures in these ancient mines. Are there really treasures in these thousands of ancient mines?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>yes, but only a few. There are good things in them. Do you want them? I can choose them one by one!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>of course I want it. If there’s a treasure, I’d be a fool not to take it. Moreover, it’s the MU family’s.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped into the square.</p><p>Mujue was sitting on the chair lazily. His mind was full of thoughts. He was thinking about how he could show off his power in the selection of the disciples of the tianshen sect. How he could be chosen by the tianshen sect and enter the yuanshen sect to cultivate. From then on, he would soar to the nine Heavens, break through the Martial Emperor realm, and even become a saint. He would be able to look down at the mountains and rivers. Just as he was thinking about it, he suddenly saw a familiar figure walking into the square.</p><p>Mujue’s pupils suddenly widened. His whole body trembled and he jumped up from the chair.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, you … Still alive? How is that possible?”</p><p>Mujue shouted in disbelief.</p><p>He was truly in disbelief. Didn’t lu Ming enter the core of the divine Ruins? Moreover, it had been more than half a month. Even an Emperor would have died after entering the core of the divine Ruins for such a long time and would not be able to come out. Now, Lu Ming actually appeared in front of him with a swagger. How could he not be shocked?</p><p>Then, he looked around and found Xie nianqing and Long Chen in the crowd. This shocked him even more.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Young master mu, what’s so strange about me being alive?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a cold smile.</p><p>“Hmph, nothing much?”</p><p>After a long time, mu Jue finally calmed down. His face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Damn it, why are these guys still alive? Damn it, I must find an opportunity to kill them, or else I won’t be able to dispel the hatred in my heart!”</p><p>Mujue thought to himself, his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>I’m here to gamble a few rounds. Young master mu, you won’t not welcome me, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a faint smile.</p><p>the MU family is open to business. Anyone who wants to come and gamble on stones is welcome. You can choose whatever you want!</p><p>Mu Jue said. Then, he sat back on his chair with a gloomy face. He was plotting something in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and casually strolled around the many ancient mines in the divine Ruins. After a while, he pointed to an ancient mine at random and said, ” “This one!”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine and paid one hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll cut it open and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His vital essence was like a knife, cutting the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine into two halves.</p><p>Immediately, a golden-yellow light spread out from the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>“A treasure has appeared, another treasure has appeared!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Mujue also stood up from his chair suddenly. His eyes were wide open. Lu Ming had actually chosen an ancient mine of the divine Ruins with treasures.</p><p>Many people opened their eyes wide, wanting to see what kind of treasure it was.</p><p>“It’s an earth Emperor Goblin! It’s an earth Emperor Goblin!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
