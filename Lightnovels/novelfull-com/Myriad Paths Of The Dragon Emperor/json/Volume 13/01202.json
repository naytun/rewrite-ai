He was somewhat curious.</p><p>Previously, when they took the cross-sea spaceship to the continent of the divine Ruins for a month, they more or less had some understanding of the continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>The reason why the continent of the divine Ruins was called the continent of the divine Ruins was that there were a few pieces of Divine Ruins on the continent of the divine Ruins, known as the ruins of gods.</p><p>Inside, it was very dangerous, but it was also filled with endless treasures and contained endless mysteries, so it was called the divine Ruins.</p><p>Legend had it that the divine Ruins originally did not exist. Countless years ago, the sky split open, and countless things fell from the sky, forming the divine Ruins.</p><p>From the divine Ruins, one could excavate a kind of ore called the divine Ruins ancient ore. Within the ore, there might be Supreme treasures.</p><p>Some people took out Supreme divine weapons, some took out Supreme secret manuals, and some even took out the bones, blood, essence, and so on of Supreme experts. They were all Supreme treasures.</p><p>Of course, there was a higher possibility that there was nothing inside.</p><p>At the scene, no one made a sound.</p><p>Buying the divine Ruins ancient mine was like gambling. Buying it, one might not get anything. The chances of wanting to cut out treasures from the divine Ruins ancient mine were too low.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Beside Mu Feng, there seemed to be flames dancing in the eyes of the noble young master. His eyes were fixed on one of the ancient mines in the divine Ruins, as if he had sensed something.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I suggest you buy it. There’s something good in one of the old mines that might be of help to you!”</p><p>At this moment, dandan’s voice was heard.</p><p>After this fellow entered the treasure Exchange Tower, he had been lying on Lu Ming’s shoulder and did not make a sound. But now, he suddenly sent Lu Ming a voice transmission.</p><p>You can sense the things in the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>It was said that the layer of glistening yellow ore outside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine was very strange. It could block spiritual senses from scanning. If one did not cut open the ancient mine, the martial artist would not be able to know in advance if there was anything inside, let alone what it was.</p><p>Only in very rare cases would he sense it.</p><p>For example, the noble young master’s bloodline was faintly beating. He felt that there was something in the old mine that matched his bloodline, which was why he could sense it.</p><p>“This old mine is mine!”</p><p>The noble young master’s eyes were bright as he said, ” I’ll bet 100000 raw stones on my luck!</p><p>100,000 raw gemstones was not a high price, but it was not low either.</p><p>If the three old mines were empty, the 100000 raw stones would have gone down the drain.</p><p>haha, mujue, you’re so rich. A hundred thousand raw stones is nothing to you. I’m not as rich as you, so I’m not betting!</p><p>“I’ll forget it too!”</p><p>On the side, the other young men laughed.</p><p>There were many ancient mines in the divine Ruins in other places of the South God Palace. If one wanted to buy them, they could buy them at any time. Therefore, the others shook their heads and did not bid.</p><p>This made mu Jue smile. If he could buy a raw gemstone with a treasure for 100000 raw gemstones, he would make a huge profit. His heart trembled.</p><p>I offer 200 thousand origin stones. It’s my first time seeing a Divine Ruins ancient mine. It’s rather interesting. I’ll try my luck too!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made mu Jue’s eyes turn cold.</p><p>“I’ll pay three hundred thousand!”</p><p>Mujue said.</p><p>“Then I’ll pay five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This made mujue’s face even more unsightly.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming and said, ” kid, you’re new here and shouldn’t know the market price of the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines, right? let me tell you, the outside world’s legend is that the divine Ruins’ ancient mines contain peerless treasures, but the chances of that are very small. 99% of the ancient mines are empty. If you buy it, you might lose out!</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that. Also, don’t you want to buy it too?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Mujue coldly snorted and continued to bid, ” “Six hundred thousand!”</p><p>At this moment, the others ‘eyes flickered.</p><p>From mujue’s expression, it seemed like he really wanted it. Could he have sensed something?</p><p>haha, I feel like my luck is pretty good today. I’ll buy it for fun too. I’ll pay seven hundred thousand!</p><p>is that so? I have the same feeling. I’ll bid 800000!</p><p>“I bid nine hundred thousand!”</p><p>……</p><p>The other young men chimed in.</p><p>To prodigies like them, a million or so raw gemstones were really nothing. If there were really treasures in the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, then it would be a huge profit.</p><p>Soon, the price had risen to 1.5 million raw stones.</p><p>This made mujue’s face even uglier.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming. If Lu Ming had not competed with him, he might have been able to buy the three Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines with just a hundred thousand raw stones. Now, he could not even buy them with two million.</p><p>Although mu Jue did not care much about one or two million raw stones, he was still upset that he had spent so many extra raw stones.</p><p>“Two million raw stones!”</p><p>Mujue gritted his teeth and called out a price.</p><p>this guy called out such a high price. Did he really sense something? ”</p><p>The others ‘eyes flickered as they continued to bid.</p><p>Very quickly, the price rose to three million.</p><p>“Lu Ming, forget it. Although there’s something in there, it’s only worth three million Yuan at most. If it goes any higher, we’ll suffer a loss!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised. It seemed that dandan could really sense the specific items inside. Otherwise, how could she even measure the price?</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming stopped bidding.</p><p>On the other hand, mujue and the other young men were still bidding. In the end, the price rose to five million raw stones, and it was finally bought by mujue.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Mujue looked at Lu Ming coldly, murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>On the side, Mu Feng was overjoyed.</p><p>this Lu Ming is really courting death. How dare he offend mujue. It seems that I don’t need to find someone to take action!</p><p>Mu Feng sneered in his heart.</p><p>After the youth sold the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, he walked down. Following that, someone else went up the stage and took out treasures to exchange.</p><p>Some people successfully exchanged for treasures, while others returned in disappointment.</p><p>They saw that the treasures they took out did not have what Xie nianqing and Lu Ming needed. The two of them shook their heads in disappointment. It seemed like it was not that easy to find what they needed.</p><p>“Everyone, I have a piece of fire spirit root here, and I need to exchange it for a sword-shaped stone. I wonder if anyone has a sword-shaped stone, one is enough!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>“What? Fire spirit root!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes lit up.</p><p>One of the main ingredients to refine the Nirvana elixir happened to be a fire spirit root.</p><p>He had finally found what he needed.</p><p>fire spiritual roots, it’s the fire spiritual roots! Pang Yuan actually took out such a precious treasure!</p><p>On the side, a series of voices sounded.</p><p>The fire spiritual root was a top grade level nine treasure. It was very rare in the world and many people were tempted.</p><p>However, a sword-shaped stone?</p><p>Many people frowned. The sword-shaped stone was a treasure of the same level as the fire spiritual root. It was also rare in the world, so who would have it?</p><p>“It’s a fire spiritual root!”</p><p>Mujue’s eyes also lit up, emitting a burning light.</p><p>His bloodline was extremely compatible with the fire spirit root. If he could refine the fire spirit root, his cultivation would definitely be greatly improved.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
