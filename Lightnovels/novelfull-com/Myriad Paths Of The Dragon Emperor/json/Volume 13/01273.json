He spat out a large mouthful of blood and was severely injured.</p><p>...</p><p>The burly man from the Tian Shen sect was terrified. Even with his cultivation, he couldn’t stop them at all. At this moment, he was extremely frightened. He used his secret treasure jade talisman to break the void and fled for his life, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Although the headless true dragon Rider didn’t have a head, it seemed to be able to see everything. The Dragon Spear in his hand stabbed into the void, and a brilliant spear radiance pierced through the space and disappeared into the vast void.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>From an unknown distance, a miserable cry came. It was the voice of the burly man from the heavenly God sect. Then, the voice fell silent and disappeared completely.</p><p>“Again, kill without mercy!”</p><p>The headless true dragon Knight said coldly and emotionlessly. Then, it turned around and left, disappearing from the palace.</p><p>Outside the divine Ruins, the void suddenly split open, and the burly man from the heavenly God sect stepped out.</p><p>At this moment, he was in an extremely sorry state. He was covered in blood and his face was pale. Blood was still flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>A bloody hole had appeared in his abdomen, and a terrifying power was eroding his body. Even with his cultivation, he couldn’t heal it immediately.</p><p>“He’s too strong!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect muttered as he looked into the depths of the divine Ruins, his eyes revealing a look of fear.</p><p>His cultivation was far above Lv 3 martial Royal realm, but he still couldn’t resist the headless true dragon Knight. If he didn’t have a life-saving secret treasure on him and wanted to escape, he would have been trapped in the divine Ruins forever. Even so, he was still seriously injured and would take a few months to recover.</p><p>a mere Divine Ruins continent actually has such a vicious place. Damn it! Also, it’s all that little bastard Lu Ming’s fault. If it weren’t for him, how could I have suffered such heavy injuries? I’m going to send an order to the South deity Palace and ask them to send people to keep an eye on the divine Ruins. Once that little bastard Lu Ming appears, kill him without mercy!</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect had a ruthless glint in his eyes. After thinking for a while, he turned around and left the place.</p><p>The core of the divine Ruins!</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction where the burly man from the heavenly God sect had left and frowned. that guy is too powerful. He’s not dead yet, so I’m afraid he won’t let this matter rest. The divine Ruins isn’t a place for us to stay for long. We’ll leave from the other direction immediately!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded without hesitation.</p><p>Since the burly man from the heavenly God sect was not dead, he would most likely think of a way to surround them outside the divine Ruins. They had to leave the divine Ruins before the other party could surround them.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing passed through the palace and went out from the other direction of the divine Ruins, in the opposite direction of the South God Palace.</p><p>The inside of the divine Ruins did not pose much of a threat to Lu Ming. Very soon, Lu Ming passed through the core of the divine Ruins and rushed out of the divine Ruins from another direction.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out of the divine Ruins, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not stop at all. They flew towards the South at top speed.</p><p>It flew for tens of millions of miles before it stopped.</p><p>It was obviously not feasible to return to the South deity Palace by taking the cross-sea spaceship. Once he returned, he might be assassinated by the burly man from the tianshen sect. It was too dangerous. Lu Ming planned to cross the sea and return to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation before he came to the divine Ruins, it would be too difficult to cross the vast ocean and return to the divine wilderness continent. He would have to spend a long time. But now, Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, and his combat strength could even suppress Supremes. It was enough for him to return to the divine wilderness continent with his own strength.</p><p>“Little Qing, you should stay in the mountain and river diagram for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>hmm, okay. Be careful!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Xie nianqing also knew that Lu Ming could only travel at full speed if she stayed in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, a beam of white light shot out from between his eyebrows and enveloped Xie nianqing. The next moment, Xie nianqing’s figure disappeared and he was kept into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure swayed. He turned into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had flown for hundreds of millions of miles and found a hidden place. He entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Xie nianqing sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, cultivating with all his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming went to another mountain peak.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, piles of raw gemstones appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming was going to break through.</p><p>Out of Lu Ming’s five types of intents, four of them were at the perfected fourth level. Only the earth intent was at the peak of the fourth level greater mastery. With his current intent cultivation, he could completely raise his cultivation to the peak of the ninth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to spend some time devouring the refined origin stone and raise his cultivation to the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm. This way, he would be able to travel much faster.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons appeared and opened their mouths to swallow a large pile of raw stones. There were a few million of them.</p><p>He swallowed a few million raw gemstones in one gulp and began to refine them quickly.</p><p>A large number of raw gemstones were constantly refined and converted into essential core. Lu Ming had almost no bottlenecks and his cultivation level was improving rapidly.</p><p>After refining a few million raw gemstones, he would swallow another few million …</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation started to skyrocket.</p><p>Eighth level spiritual God early stage, eighth level spiritual God middle stage, eighth level spiritual God late stage …</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming relied on a huge number of raw gemstones and broke through the barrier in one fell swoop, reaching the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>After reaching the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm, Lu Ming did not stop. He continued to devour refined raw gemstones and continued to improve.</p><p>Early ninth level spiritual God Realm, middle ninth level spiritual God Realm, late ninth level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>Another seven days passed, and Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached the peak of the ninth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In just half a month, Lu Ming’s cultivation had rushed from the early eighth level spiritual God Realm to the peak ninth level spiritual God Realm. The span of the leap was so great that it was shocking to hear.</p><p>Of course, this was also because Lu Ming’s intent realm had long met the requirements. Otherwise, the intent realm would become a bottleneck and hinder Lu Ming’s breakthrough.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming’s intent realm had a breakthrough, he would not have any bottlenecks.</p><p>However, the number of raw gemstones he spent was also terrifying. In just half a month, Lu Ming had devoured and refined a total of fifty million raw gemstones.</p><p>What kind of shocking number was this?</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that the essential core in his body was about to overflow. It was unimaginably rich. He exhaled, forming a storm that swept across the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward. He rushed out of the mountain and river diagram and appeared in the sky above a mountain range.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Vital essence boiled on Lu Ming’s body, forming a pillar of air that shot into the sky, creating a huge hole.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He felt that there was an endless amount of energy in his body.</p><p>The vital essence of a peak ninth level spiritual God was too powerful. It was much stronger than the vital essence of an early eighth level spiritual God.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to crush and even kill an ordinary Supreme-being without the help of the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Of course, it was a different story for those Supremes who had awakened a ninth level divine bloodline.</p><p>let’s go. We will return to the divine wilderness continent now!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and stretched out his hands. He grabbed at the void and tore it apart. The space was like a piece of paper as Lu Ming tore it apart, revealing a pitch-black spatial Rift.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
