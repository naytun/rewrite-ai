Due to his carelessness, he had not discovered it.</p><p>...</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The flaming chains wrapped around Long Chen.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Long Chen roared and threw out his fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two punches were so powerful that they pierced through the space, but the flame chains were very strong. Long Chen’s punches only shook the flame chains, but they didn’t break.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Then, the green stone glowed, and more flame chains spread out.</p><p>die! Long Chen shouted angrily. His entire body glowed, and his arm became thick. A layer of scales appeared on his arm as he punched out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the flaming chains was finally broken.</p><p>But what followed were even more chains, and two of them were already wrapped around Long Chen’s body.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The chains wrapped around Long Chen’s body, making a sizzling sound. Green smoke was even coming out of Long Chen’s body.</p><p>This flame chain was extremely terrifying. It actually ignored Long Chen’s protective true Yuan and directly acted on his body.</p><p>A layer of scale armor appeared on Long Chen’s skin, exactly the same as the one on the Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The chains were working on the scales, causing them to creak. From the looks of it, they wouldn’t be able to last much longer.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Long Chen’s muscles bulged as he grabbed the two chains and struggled with all his might. He finally broke the two chains, but more chains appeared around him and enveloped him.</p><p>these flame chains are so terrifying. They can cut objects in half. I don’t think long Chen can hold on for long!</p><p>Xie nianqing said with a serious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on the bluestone and the runes.</p><p>He was looking for a way to break it.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>As time passed, the light on the bluestone grew brighter and brighter. More and more flame chains appeared, and Long Chen was getting more and more exhausted. There were already a few strangulation marks on his body, and he was almost cut in half by the flame chains.</p><p>“Long Chen, take two steps to the right and three steps back!” He ordered.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>Long Chen was slightly taken aback, but he did as he was told without hesitation.</p><p>He took two steps to the right, then three steps back. A few chains brushed past Long Chen by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>“Four steps to the right, two steps forward, five steps to the left …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on the bluestone as he continued to give instructions.</p><p>Now, Ming Lian’s second body had already obtained the inheritance of the profound sky Saint in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. After cultivating hard in the secret realm of the Saint mansion, his progress in the Dao of Ming Lian was at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and his clone were connected in their minds. As his Dao of inscription of the clone improved, Lu Ming’s eyesight had naturally improved greatly as well. Although he did not have mental energy fire and could not inscribe inscriptions, he could still see the flaws in the array.</p><p>Following Lu Ming’s instructions, Long Chen dodged to the right, then to the left, then to the back, then to the front. He dodged all the chains and slowly left the range of the bluestone.</p><p>“Dandan, I need your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to dandan when he saw Long Chen coming to the edge of the bluestone.</p><p>“Don’t worry, just watch me!”</p><p>Dandan flew out and waved its claws. Inscriptions appeared and formed a large array, then it rushed into the bluestone.</p><p>“Long Chen is out!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Without hesitation, Long Chen charged out. The formation he had formed glowed, temporarily imprisoning the flaming chains. However, in the next moment, they collapsed one by one.</p><p>In this short moment, Long Chen managed to rush out of the bluestone and let out a long breath.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Long Chen cupped his fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re welcome, it’s nothing much!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>I, Long Chen, clearly distinguish between gratitude and grudges. You saved my life this time, and I will remember it in my heart!</p><p>Long Chen said solemnly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>be careful in this place. It looks broken, but there are some parts of the array that are still powerful even after so many years!</p><p>Dandan reminded.</p><p>“Dandan, do you know how to get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I can only try my best. Follow me and don’t walk around!”</p><p>Dandan flew out and circled around, carefully sizing up the surroundings.</p><p>“This way!”</p><p>After a while, dandan pointed in a direction.</p><p>“This way? Isn’t this side heading towards the core of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Long Chen also looked at dandan in confusion.</p><p>“What are you looking at? If you don’t believe me, then you can look for him yourself!”</p><p>Dandan pouted and ran away.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only trust this fellow. The three of them followed dandan and moved forward carefully.</p><p>Dandan and Lu Ming observed carefully. Along the way, they avoided many broken formations and moved forward.</p><p>There’s a Divine Ruins ancient mine!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up as he looked into the distance. There were a few ancient mines in the divine Ruins that were exposed to the outside.</p><p>The divine Ruins ‘core had never been excavated before by anyone in the past. It was absolutely a huge treasure trove.</p><p>“There’s no formation there, you can collect it!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his vital essence and collected the few Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines.</p><p>you all have to remember, some remnant arrays are very powerful. Once you enter, even the Emperor will die. Even if you see the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, don’t take it. Don’t be blinded by greed!</p><p>Dandan had a mature look as she earnestly warned everyone.</p><p>But the next moment, dandan’s eyes lit up as she stared to the right and shouted, ” a level 9 spiritual herb!</p><p>Then, he ran over, grabbed a sparkling and resplendent spirit herb, and stuffed it into his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In that place, runes glowed and formed terrifying beams of light that shot towards dandan.</p><p>She was in a state of panic, jumping up and down. In the end, she managed to escape with her powerful defense and profound Dao of inscription.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were speechless. This guy had just warned them. In the end, when he saw the spiritual medicine, he immediately rushed over.</p><p>However, they were also secretly shocked. The spiritual herb that dan dan had just obtained was indeed extremely shocking. It was a level nine spiritual herb.</p><p>This area was truly a treasure trove.</p><p>The party advanced carefully. Along the way, they indeed encountered quite a number of treasures, mainly Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines and spirit medicines.</p><p>Most of the spirit herbs went into dandan’s mouth, while the ancient mine of the divine Ruins was divided equally among Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Long Chen.</p><p>Of course, in some dangerous places, even if they saw spirit medicines and Divine Ruins ancient mines, the few of them did not collect them and directly gave up.</p><p>“This is … A nine-leaf Zoysia!”</p><p>Not long after, they saw a spiritual herb with nine leaves. It was sparkling and translucent, and the medicinal fragrance assailed their nostrils. It was actually a nine-leaf Ganoderma, one of the main ingredients for refining the Nirvana pill.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He did not expect to encounter a nine-leaf Zoysia here.</p><p>However, the place where the nine-leafed mushroom grew had a broken array. In the end, Lu Ming and dandan worked together and spent a lot of effort before they successfully harvested the nine-leafed mushroom. For this, dandan spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and cried out that she had made a loss.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the nine-leaf Clover and was in a good mood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
