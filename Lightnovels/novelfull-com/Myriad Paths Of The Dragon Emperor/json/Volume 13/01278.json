When he used the prison-suppressing heaven technique, the power was terrifying.</p><p>The two fists collided, and the space exploded. The surrounding space spread in all directions like a spider web.</p><p>A terrifying force shot out. Then, a figure trembled and stepped on the void with loud bangs. He retreated madly, causing the space to tremble.</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, the figure was not Lu Ming, but the Supreme-being, a burly Supreme-being.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not move an inch.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Everyone was stunned and dumbfounded. They found it hard to believe.</p><p>Even the Supreme martial artists who were in the midst of a chaotic battle were stunned and stopped fighting.</p><p>A young man who didn’t even look thirty years old had actually forced a Supreme martial artist to retreat with a single punch. How was this possible? Who was this person?</p><p>“Damn it, kill, kill!”</p><p>The Supreme-being who had been pushed back finally reacted and let out an angry roar.</p><p>He was a dignified Supreme-being, yet he was forced back by a young man’s punch. He felt that he had lost a lot of face. At this time, he could no longer care about snatching the map. He wanted to kill Lu Ming and restore his reputation.</p><p>Two pairs of gloves appeared on his head. This was his bloodline, a sixth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>He put on the gloves and punched continuously. The power of his fist technique increased several times.</p><p>The fist force that was as heavy as a mountain drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>His essential core boiled and the nine dragon energies caused Lu Ming’s strength to skyrocket. He punched out with both fists continuously and exchanged blows with his opponent.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After exchanging more than ten punches, Lu Ming had the upper hand and suppressed his opponent.</p><p>In the distance, the martial artists who were watching the battle were dumbfounded. They were completely speechless.</p><p>Previously, they had thought that Lu Ming had overestimated himself and dared to enter the place. They had thought that he was courting death or that Lu Ming was just like them and wanted to watch from a distance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming actually charged into the battlefield. They thought that Lu Ming was courting death and was dead for sure.</p><p>But the result was far beyond their expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat ability almost blinded them.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight against a Supreme-being and even suppress one. This was simply like a fantasy.</p><p>“It’s time to end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The third bloodline appeared above his head. A surge of energy gushed out from the third bloodline and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>After borrowing the power of the third bloodline, Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and forced the other party to retreat. With another punch, the sound of bones breaking could be heard. The other party’s fist had been broken by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The third bloodline turned into a combat sword, cutting through the void and slashing at the other party. The other party screamed as one of his arms was cut off by the Blood Sword.</p><p>The other party retreated frantically, his face filled with fear.</p><p>The other Supreme martial artists, including Hai Tian, were all shocked.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist was injured just like that. What kind of battle prowess was this?</p><p>“Give me the map!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on one of the Supreme martial artists and charged toward him.</p><p>The storage ring of hundred poisons Supreme was in the hands of that Supreme martial artist.</p><p>The Supreme-being’s expression changed drastically when he saw Lu Ming charging toward him. He retreated at top speed.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the other party.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and a ferocious spatial crack appeared in the void. A chaotic spatial storm surged towards the other party.</p><p>The Supreme-being tried his best to resist, but he was still forced to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current strength was too powerful. He had already far surpassed the average Supreme-being.</p><p>attack! Let’s attack together! This person is too strong!</p><p>The Supreme martial artist roared.</p><p>that’s right, let’s attack together. All of you, attack together. Kill this person first, and then get the map of the pure spirit body!</p><p>Hai Tian also shouted.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming with a gaze filled with jealousy and hatred.</p><p>He was envious of Lu Ming’s talent. He looked younger than him, but his cultivation and combat strength were so terrifying. He hated it. He was so jealous that he wanted to go crazy. He wanted to destroy Lu Ming and make such a genius disappear from the world.</p><p>“Young master …”</p><p>On the horizon, the two Supreme martial artists were still hesitating.</p><p>“Attack! I order you all to attack and kill this man together!”</p><p>Hai Tian roared in anger.</p><p>The two Supreme-beings had no choice but to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>The other Supreme-beings also attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. They felt threatened. If Lu Ming got the pure spirit body map, it would be difficult for them to take it. Therefore, they decided to get rid of Lu Ming first.</p><p>The ten Supreme-beings attacked Lu Ming at the same time. Their power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens, and the nine Dragon bloodlines emerged. Lu Ming performed the fusion of the bloodlines and transformed into Nine Dragons. The devouring power burst out and enveloped all the Supreme-beings.</p><p>Then, the Dragon Claw stepped out continuously.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two Supreme martial artists were struck by the Dragon Claw and retreated while coughing up blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The divine Dragon wagged its tail, and one of Hai Tian’s Supreme martial artists was sent flying while vomiting blood.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Above the heads of the nine Dragons, the lightning cauldron appeared. Thousands of lightning bolts filled the air and enveloped the remaining Supreme martial artists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as all the Supreme-beings ‘attacks were blocked.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>In the distance, gasps of cold air could be heard. The large mouthfuls of cold air almost caused their lungs to explode.</p><p>This was too shocking. Ten Supreme-beings had joined forces to besiege a young man. In the end, not only had this young man blocked all of them, but a few of them had even been injured.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>he is Lu Ming, the divine wilderness continent’s Lu Ming, the number one prodigy of the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>Suddenly, one of the Supreme martial artists shouted.</p><p>This Supreme-being had also gone to watch the selection of the major sects in the yuan continent and recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>the strongest heaven’s favorite among the younger generation in the divine Ruins continent? ”</p><p>“Didn’t he return to the divine Ruins continent? Why are you still here?”</p><p>my God, it’s actually him. No wonder he’s so terrifying.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>By now, Lu Ming’s name had already spread to every corner of the divine Ruins. Most people knew that during the selection of disciples by the major sects in the yuanlu continent, the divine wilderness continent had emerged as a new force. The most terrifying person was still a youth called Lu Ming. He had suppressed all the heroes and obtained first place. No one in the younger generation could match him.</p><p>even if he’s the number one expert of the younger generation, his combat strength is terrifying enough!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>It was truly astonishing that he could remain unscathed under the joint attack of ten great Supremes.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s actually him!”</p><p>Hai Tian gritted his teeth in hatred.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>kill! the nine Dragons said indifferently as they turned and charged toward the Supreme-being who had the storage ring of the hundred poisons Supreme.</p><p>The man wanted to resist, but after being beaten up by Lu Ming until he vomited a large mouthful of blood, he did not dare to resist anymore. He threw the storage ring to Lu Ming, who grabbed it.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the storage ring. With a thought, a rolled-up map appeared in his hands.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as he held the map, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
