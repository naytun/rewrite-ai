We’ll fight again next time!”</p><p>...</p><p>The Ice Dragon left these words and actually turned to leave, escaping just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. He transformed back into his human form and stared coldly in the direction where the Ice Dragon had left.</p><p>The Ice Dragon was indeed very powerful. Although Lu Ming still had some tricks up his sleeve and had not activated his third Blood Meridian, he might not be able to kill the Ice Dragon even if he activated his third Blood Meridian.</p><p>Moreover, he already had nine keys. Even if he killed the Ice Dragon, he wouldn’t be able to obtain more keys.</p><p>“Take a look inside the palace, what’s inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming flew high into the sky and came to the front of the hall.</p><p>There was a stone tablet in front of the gate of the palace. There were nine small holes on the stone tablet, just like keyholes.</p><p>With a thought, the nine keys above his head flew into the nine small holes.</p><p>All nine keys were inserted into the small hole.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The palace’s door opened.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Without any hesitation, he stepped out and entered the hall through the door.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered, the door of the hall closed again.</p><p>Within the palace was a large hall.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were several platforms in the hall. There were orbs of light on the platforms.</p><p>He could see that there were symbols under the light.</p><p>On one of the platforms, under the light balls, there were some symbols of pills.</p><p>The powerhouse from the tianshen sect said. There were opportunities in this small plane, and the keys were with each of them. The opportunities he was talking about should be these light balls, right?</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess and then continued to size him up.</p><p>Under the ball of light on the other platform, the symbol was much more complicated.</p><p>Under some of the balls of light were patterns in the shape of lightning.</p><p>Under some of the light orbs were patterns of flames, waves, tornadoes, and others.</p><p>“What’s in these light balls? How many can I choose? You can’t possibly give them all to me, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming walked to the light orb marked with the lightning pattern and reached out to grab it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The ball of light was destroyed and a jade talisman was in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“It’s that easy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised. Then, his eyes lit up and he stretched out his hand to grab another ball of light.</p><p>It didn’t move at all!</p><p>The ball of light seemed to be a layer of protective shield that firmly blocked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his quintessential essence and even unleashed his dragon energy. However, the ball of light did not budge at all. He could not break it.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming changed to another light orb but the result was the same.</p><p>Lu Ming tried almost all the light orbs but he could not break any of them.</p><p>it seems like I can only obtain one item from each ball of light!</p><p>Lu Ming guessed and could only give up.</p><p>“I wonder what is recorded in this Jade token?”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat curious. What was the opportunity that the tianshen sect was talking about?</p><p>He sent his spiritual sense into the Jade token and carefully examined it.</p><p>it’s a martial technique, a low-grade martial technique of god level intent!</p><p>martial technique of creation? ”</p><p>After Lu Ming took a look, a look of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p>What was a martial technique of creation?</p><p>Lu Ming only knew about bloodline martial arts techniques. Other than bloodline martial arts techniques, the other martial arts techniques were all ordinary martial arts techniques. How could there be martial arts techniques of creation? Lu Ming had never heard of it.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming read the content carefully.</p><p>The Thundergod strike was the name of this martial technique.</p><p>“So amazing, so amazing!”</p><p>After looking at it for a while, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was filled with amazement.</p><p>He finally understood what a martial technique of creation was.</p><p>Ordinary Warriors who had comprehended the will of heaven and earth would become more powerful as their levels increased. However, they had not yet discovered the true power of the will.</p><p>Normal martial artists only used the power of intent roughly.</p><p>Take Lu Ming for example. The fusion of five types of heaven and earth intent realms was usually only used to increase Lu Ming’s attack power. However, the deeper levels of each intent realm had not been excavated.</p><p>As for martial techniques of intent, through martial techniques and special Operations, the power of the intent could be exerted to the fullest. The potential of the intent could be used to the extreme.</p><p>Lu Ming had never even heard of martial arts techniques of creation in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The levels of martial techniques of intent were the same as ordinary martial techniques, such as the low-grade divine level and the high-grade divine level.</p><p>The low-grade divine level martial technique focused on the deep application of intent.</p><p>As for the high-grade God-level techniques, they were not considered intent martial techniques. They should be called domain martial techniques, which could exert the emperor’s domain to the extreme.</p><p>The power of martial techniques of creation was several times stronger than ordinary martial techniques and even bloodline martial techniques. It was very terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it carefully. The more he looked, the more shocked he was.</p><p>what a powerful and terrifying power. However, it’s too profound. The difficulty of cultivating it is astonishingly high!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>The martial technique of creation was powerful, but it was more difficult to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that although they were both low-grade divine-level martial arts techniques, the difficulty of cultivating the martial arts technique of creation was a hundred times more difficult than cultivating ordinary low-grade divine-level martial arts techniques.</p><p>Yes, it was a hundred times!</p><p>Martial techniques of creation were a hundred times harder to cultivate than ordinary martial techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and looked at it carefully. In the end, he simply took out the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it at the side to help with his comprehension.</p><p>Unconsciously, Lu Ming’s mind was immersed in the Thundergod strike, trying to figure out the profoundness of it.</p><p>After the battle of Providence, Lu Ming’s comprehension had increased by ten times. Now, under the path-understanding ancient tree, his understanding of the Thundergod strike was improving rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely immersed in the cultivation of the Thundergod strike. Seven days had passed unknowingly.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Bolts of lightning were swimming around Lu Ming’s body as if they were alive and had spirituality.</p><p>In the end, the lightning on Lu Ming’s body increased in number but became thinner. In the end, there were countless bolts of lightning, each one thinner than a strand of hair. Countless bolts of lightning as thin as this weaved together to form a lightning armor. It looked exactly the same as ordinary clothes. There was no difference at all.</p><p>However, if anyone touched it with their hands, they would be turned to ashes by the power of lightning.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>I’ve successfully cultivated the first level of the Thunder God’s strike!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>After seven days of comprehension, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated the first stage of the Thundergod strike in one go. This speed was already very shocking.</p><p>Some peerless geniuses could spend their entire lives and still not reach the first level.</p><p>martial arts techniques of intent are indeed wonderful. It can fully unleash the potential energy of the Thunder intent. I’m still at the first level. The more I practice, the more powerful it will be!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the lightning combat suit draped over his body. With a thought, the lightning combat suit disappeared.</p><p>it seems that the Ice Dragon also cultivates martial techniques of creation. No wonder the ice creation can release such a terrifying power!</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the Ice Dragon.</p><p>However, the Ice Dragon should have cultivated it a long time ago. It had just entered this place at that time, so it couldn’t have obtained it from here. The martial technique of creation should have been inherited from the North God Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
