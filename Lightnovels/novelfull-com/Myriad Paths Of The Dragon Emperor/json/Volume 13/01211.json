It was like two stars had collided. Terrifying energy fluctuations swept in all directions. Countless stone pillars were turned into dust under the energy ripples.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the light of the flames, the huge meteorite was knocked back and slammed into the ground, creating a huge pit.</p><p>The perfected spiritual God was no match for Lu Ming and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Not far away, mu Jue was almost scared to death. This was too terrifying. Even a great circle spiritual God was no match for him. What kind of combat power was this?</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The cold voice came out of the prison-suppressing stele and continued to press down on the huge meteorite.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a huge palm print came from the side and hit the prison-suppressing stele, blocking it for a moment. It was another great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the huge meteorite flew out of the ground and met up with another great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>“Let’s attack together! This person is too monstrous!”</p><p>An old voice came from the huge meteorite, and it was filled with shock.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other great circle spiritual God shouted. Two great circle spiritual gods joined forces and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The great circle of the spiritual God Realm was several times more powerful than the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>In a sense, the great circle of the spiritual God Realm was already the peak of the spiritual God Realm. Standing at the highest point of the spiritual God Realm, one would be an Emperor.</p><p>As for the Supreme-being realm, it was actually just a stage in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm that was on the way to the Emperor realm.</p><p>Emperors needed to transform their intent into a domain, while Supremes had already comprehended the embryonic form of a domain, but had not yet fully transformed it into a domain.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Even though he was facing two great circle spiritual gods, Lu Ming’s killing intent was still soaring. The prison-suppressing stele emitted a brilliant light and pressed down on the two of them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two perfected spiritual God powerhouses joined forces to resist and burst out with terrifying attacks. However, they were suppressed by Lu Ming in the end. They were continuously bombarded by the stone tablet and were forced to retreat.</p><p>The two of them joined forces but were still at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Dragon and elephant battling the heavens!”</p><p>On the other side, the Archean dragonesque elephant went berserk. Its body expanded, and its scales were dense. It was tens of thousands of feet tall, and it had the terrifying power to trample through mountains and rivers.</p><p>Long Chen was also facing two experts in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. At this moment, the immemorial Dragon elephant’s terrifying combat strength was fully displayed. He was fighting two experts in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm alone and was not at a disadvantage at all. He even had the upper hand.</p><p>the bloodline of the top ten warbeasts is indeed terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the situation over there and he was secretly shocked.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was looking forward to the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Right now, the nine Dragon bloodline was only at the eighth level of the divine level and had yet to reach perfection. However, once the nine Dragon bloodline reached perfection, it would definitely be even stronger. Furthermore, it would give birth to the ninth dragon energy, and its might would definitely be even more terrifying.</p><p>At that time, the power of the bloodline of the nine Dragons alone would not be weaker than Long Chen’s.</p><p>The two of them had joined forces and were actually able to suppress four great circle spiritual God stage experts.</p><p>“How could this be? How did this happen?”</p><p>Mujue murmured to himself, his eyes wide open in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming and Long Chen’s strength had far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>He had already overestimated Lu Ming. He had brought four perfected spiritual God experts and more than a dozen eighth and ninth level spiritual God experts. Even with such terrifying combat strength, not only did he fail to kill Lu Ming and Long Chen, but he had also fallen into a disadvantageous position. It was something that he had never imagined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook, forcing the two perfected spiritual God Realm experts to retreat. Then, it moved horizontally, shaking a ninth level spiritual God Realm expert to death.</p><p>Then, the prison-suppressing stele pressed down on a great circle of the spiritual God stage who was fighting with Long Chen.</p><p>The powerhouse never expected Lu Ming to suddenly attack him. At that moment, he was fighting Long Chen with all his might and was caught off guard. He was hit by the prison-suppressing stele. With a scream, half of his body was blown up. He fell to the ground with only half of his breath left.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>yes! Long Chen replied without any hesitation. With a long roar, an elephant leg as tall as a heavenly pillar stomped out, causing another great circle spiritual God expert to spit out blood and retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming suppressed him and killed the perfected spiritual God.</p><p>“Not good, young master, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The expressions of the two perfected spiritual God experts who had been fighting Lu Ming changed drastically. Lu Ming suddenly changed his target and joined forces with Long Chen at lightning speed, killing the two perfected spiritual God experts. It was already too late for them to rescue him.</p><p>At this moment, the only thing they could think of was to escape.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>Mujue roared in his heart as he turned around and fled frantically.</p><p>Two perfected spiritual God experts followed closely behind. There were also a few ninth level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming would not let mu Jue escape so easily. The huge prison-suppressing stele broke through the space and charged at mu Jue.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant stomped on the void, and the space kept exploding as it chased after mujue.</p><p>The distance between the two sides was constantly closing.</p><p>run, run! Take me with you and run! Go and stop them!</p><p>Mu Jue ordered two perfected spiritual God experts to take him and escape. He also ordered a few ninth level spiritual God Realm experts to block Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The faces of the few ninth level spiritual God Realm experts turned the color of pig liver. Asking them to go and block Lu Ming and the others, wasn’t that courting death?</p><p>The few of them were naturally unwilling to go.</p><p>if you don’t go, I’ll report to my father. You’ll still die!</p><p>Mujue roared.</p><p>He was the young master of the MU family and was extremely talented. He was 100% sure that he would become an Emperor in the future. Therefore, he had a lot of power.</p><p>A few ninth level spiritual God Realm experts looked at each other and suddenly flew to the sides. They had actually escaped.</p><p>They would die if they went to stop Lu Ming and the rest. They would die if they went back. They might as well escape.</p><p>“Damn traitor!”</p><p>Mu Jue roared and almost peed his pants.</p><p>The two great circle spiritual God stage experts carried mu Jue and ran at top speed. However, Lu Ming and Long Chen were getting closer and closer to them.</p><p>not good, Lu Ming. There’s a Supreme-being approaching from ahead. It might be a Supreme-being from the MU family!</p><p>Suddenly, dandan shouted.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>With his current cultivation base, he would definitely die if he were to face a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>A Supreme-being was already considered half a step away from an Emperor. Once the embryonic form of a domain was formed, no one could compete with him. Killing a perfected spiritual God was as easy as eating and drinking. Lu Ming and the rest were no match for him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, retreat quickly. Otherwise, it’ll be too late. A Supreme-being can tear open space!”</p><p>Dandan cried out anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he shouted, ” “Long Chen, let’s go!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming changed his direction and flew away.</p><p>There would be plenty of opportunities to kill mu Jue in the future, but he couldn’t bring Xie nianqing along with him to face the Grandmaster.</p><p>Although Long Chen did not know why, he knew that Lu Ming must have discovered something. Without any hesitation, he turned around and followed Lu Ming, running madly behind him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them were far away.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Mu Jue and the two perfected spiritual God experts were a little stunned. They did not know why Lu Ming and the rest had suddenly escaped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
