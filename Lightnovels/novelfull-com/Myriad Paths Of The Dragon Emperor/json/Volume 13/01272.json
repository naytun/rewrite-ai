Two auras bloomed in the divine Ruins ‘core, terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>...</p><p>The master of the MU family was a genuine Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. He was stronger than Xie Luan, who had not recovered, or Di Yi. He formed a big hand and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>As for the burly man from the heaven God sect, his aura was even more unfathomable and completely unpredictable. He could only feel that he was much stronger than the master of the MU family.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a giant bird formed. It opened its mouth and bit at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s gazes froze, their expressions remained calm as they stood still at the Hall’s entrance.</p><p>those who trespass the time and space spiritual Palace will be killed without mercy!</p><p>Suddenly, a cold and emotionless voice came from within the palace.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two rays of spear light shot out from the palace. The black spear light, with a terrifying radiance, collided with the attacks of the MU family master and the middle-aged man from the divine God sect.</p><p>With two loud bangs, their attacks were penetrated by the spear radiance. However, the two spear radiance also disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the world.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, a huge creature slowly walked out of the palace. The ground shook with every step it took.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>When the MU family’s master, young master Lin, and the middle-aged man from the heaven God sect saw the huge object that walked out of the palace, their pupils suddenly shrank and they revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>The huge being that walked out of the palace was naturally the headless true dragon Rider.</p><p>Previously, bubbles had brought Lu Ming and the rest to open a space-time Tunnel and directly rushed into the core of the divine Ruins, arriving here.</p><p>Since Lu Ming had the token of origin, the headless true dragon Knight treated him as one of its own. However, the MU family’s master and the rest did not have the token of origin. Since they attacked the palace, they were naturally attacked by the headless true dragon Knight.</p><p>The headless true dragon Rider was formed after the death of a super expert and was not a living being. Therefore, the master of the MU family and the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect could not sense it.</p><p>“Kill without mercy!”</p><p>The headless true dragon rider’s voice came out of nowhere, and then a shocking dragon roar resounded. The headless true dragon extended a Dragon Claw and clawed at the MU family’s master.</p><p>As the Dragon Claw struck out, it rapidly grew in size until it covered the sky and the sun, shrouding a part of the world. Under the Dragon Claw, the space crumbled into a mess.</p><p>“Aeon blue sky!”</p><p>The master of the MU family felt a fatal threat. He raised his head and let out a long roar. He punched out, and a towering ancient tree, like the legendary Divine Tree of the world, collided with the Dragon Claw.</p><p>This move was the MU family’s master’s strongest move. It combined the power of his territory and his spirit body. It was extremely powerful. An ordinary second level martial Royal realm martial artist would be severely injured or even killed by this move.</p><p>However, in the next moment, the pupils of the MU family’s master rapidly contracted.</p><p>That was because when the Dragon Claw descended, the towering ancient tree he had struck out could not even withstand a single breath before it disintegrated and dissipated into energy. The Dragon Claw did not stop and continued to claw at the MU family’s master.</p><p>This claw had sealed off the void, and the MU family’s master couldn’t escape even if he wanted to.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The MU family’s master was scared. He let out a loud roar, and his spiritual body glowed. The power of his domain spread out, and his fists struck out wildly.</p><p>However, under the dragon’s claws, everything was useless and in vain.</p><p>The MU family head’s attack and defense were like tofu under the dragon’s claws, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>On the side, the burly man from the heavenly God sect wanted to save him. He launched an attack on the Dragon Claw, but he could not move the Dragon Claw at all.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The MU family’s head howled in despair. In the next moment, the Dragon Claw covered his body and began to shrink, grabbing the MU family’s head in its claws.</p><p>“No, spare my life, spare my life …”</p><p>The MU family’s master roared in fear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The headless true dragon rider’s voice was completely emotionless. As it spoke, it clenched its Dragon Claw, and with a bang, the MU family’s master’s body directly exploded, his body and spirit destroyed.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The Knight on the true Dragon’s neck actually emitted a powerful suction force, completely absorbing the blood essence and energy of the MU family’s master.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it was a pity. If he were to refine the blood essence of an Emperor, he would definitely be able to advance the prison suppressing stele bloodline to divine level nine.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming was secretly shocked. The headless true dragon Knight was too powerful. That headless true dragon was definitely a pure-blooded true dragon. He did not know what realm it had reached when it was alive. It was definitely an invincible existence. Even after death, it could still maintain such powerful combat strength. One could imagine how powerful it was when it was alive.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s go!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect was extremely frightened. The headless true dragon rider’s power had far exceeded his expectations. Although his cultivation base was much stronger than the master of the MU family, he was still scared when he faced the headless true dragon Rider. He felt that a great disaster was imminent.</p><p>After the MU family head was killed, he didn’t hesitate to tear open space and escape with young master Lin.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The headless true dragon Rider shouted coldly and clawed out again. A Black Dragon Claw covered the sky and clawed at the middle-aged man and young master Lin. The terrifying power not only made the middle-aged man’s face change but also almost scared young master Lin to death.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, run, run!”</p><p>young master Lin shouted like he had gone crazy.</p><p>As the Dragon Claw descended, it sealed off the space in all directions. The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect was unable to break open the space, just like the MU family’s master.</p><p>The Dragon Claw didn’t stop and continued to claw down.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man from the heaven God sect threw young master Lin towards the dragon’s claw. He took out a Jade card and his face was filled with pain. The vital essence in his body poured into the Jade card.</p><p>“No, no, don’t! You’ll die a terrible death …”</p><p>young master Lin was thrown out and he peed his pants. He was so terrified that he started to scream.</p><p>He struggled with all his might, but with his cultivation, he was as small as an ant under the dragon’s claws.</p><p>no, help! Lu Ming, I beg you to let me go!</p><p>young master Lin shouted incoherently. At this moment, his heart was filled with regret.</p><p>All of this was because he had fallen for Xie nianqing and had a conflict with Lu Ming.</p><p>Later on, he was defeated by Lu Ming in public and harbored even more hatred in his heart. He bribed the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect with great benefits and incited him to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>If it wasn’t for all of this, he wouldn’t have ended up in his current state.</p><p>he screamed but in the end, the Dragon Claw pressed down and young master Lin’s body exploded. Under the terrifying energy, he turned into dust.</p><p>The Dragon Claw continued to claw at the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade card in the hand of the burly man from the heavenly God sect emitted a brilliant light. Then, a light-shaped combat sword emerged and brought the burly man from the heavenly God sect to break open the space and escape at an extreme speed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the Dragon Claw came down, one of its sharp fingers swept across the burly man of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The burly man’s body trembled as if he had been struck by lightning. His body almost cracked and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. However, he couldn’t care less about his injuries and ran for his life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
