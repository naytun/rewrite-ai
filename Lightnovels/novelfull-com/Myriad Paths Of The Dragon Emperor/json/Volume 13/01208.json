It’s just two early stage sixth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The remaining two had reached the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Little girl, how dare you stop me? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The bald young man roared as his vital essence surged and he pounced towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Black lotuses appeared around Xie nianqing, forming sharp Lotus swords. Together with the sky demon force field, they fought the bald youth. The two of them were evenly matched, and it was difficult to tell who was stronger.</p><p>this little girl’s combat strength is not bad. It’s rare to have such combat strength at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>One of the remaining two young men said.</p><p>not bad indeed. It’s a pity that his cultivation is too weak. There’s also a kid in the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. Leave him to me!</p><p>With that, one of the young men pounced on Lu Ming in a flash. He was as fast as lightning, and his palm was like a knife as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure did not move. He did not even look and similarly struck out a palm at the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two palms collided. Lu Ming did not move, but the other party’s figure flew backward.</p><p>he has some combat strength. It seems like we won’t be able to take him down unless we use our true strength!</p><p>The young man’s eyes turned cold and serious.</p><p>A long spear appeared in his hand, shining with a sharp aura.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He became one with the spear and stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Dragon power in Lu Ming’s body erupted as he continued to strike with his palm.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming moved later but arrived first. His palm was like lightning as it struck the Spear’s shaft.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled continuously, and the man’s expression changed. His body trembled, and he was sent flying again.</p><p>This time, not only him, but the other young man’s face also became serious.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm, but the combat strength that erupted from him was shocking. He had easily repelled existences at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm time and time again.</p><p>They weren’t ordinary spiritual gods. They were top geniuses.</p><p>treasures belong to those with strength. Since you guys have this strength, then these few pieces of Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines will be given to you guys. Puppet fighter, let’s go!</p><p>One of the young men spoke, and his last words were directed at the bald young man.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength made them feel that he was unfathomable. There was no need to fight with Lu Ming for a few Divine Ruins ancient mines.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The bald young man exchanged a blow with Xie nianqing and retreated.</p><p>“You injured my friend the moment you arrived, and now you’re leaving just after saying a few words. Hehe, who do you think we are?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The aura on his body rose and his eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Kid, we’ve already taken the initiative to retreat. What else do you want? You’re taking advantage of us, yet you’re still acting innocent. Do you really think we’re afraid of you because we fought evenly with the continent?”</p><p>The bald young man shouted.</p><p>“Are you the ones who fought to a draw with the continent?”</p><p>Tuoba Shi exclaimed.</p><p>“A draw with the continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The divine Ruins ‘continent cluster had a total of 42 continents. These continents naturally had strong and weak ones too.</p><p>Although the divine wilderness continent was not at the bottom of the divine Ruins continent group, it was still in the lower-middle range and was ranked in the last ten.</p><p>And the divine Ruins continent was the number one in name and reality.</p><p>Other than the continent of Divine Ruins, it was also very strong to fight evenly with the continent, and it was ranked in the top ten of the continent of Divine Ruins.</p><p>It was also the only two continents that made it into the top ten among the nine Continents of the South God Palace.</p><p>The three young men before him were from the ping Ping continent. No wonder they were filled with arrogance.</p><p>No wonder he was so powerful. Two of the three people he met had actually stepped into the sixth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Seeing Tuoba Shi’s shocked expression, the bald young man and the other two looked pleased.</p><p>“I don’t care which continent you’re from. If you don’t leave something behind today, don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to speak as he strode forward. The bald young man and the other two men’s faces turned ugly as they approached.</p><p>you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. I’ll see what you’re capable of!</p><p>The young man who had attacked Lu Ming earlier had a cold look in his eyes. A long spear appeared above his head. He performed the blood fusion and transformed into a long spear. The terrifying sharp power filled the air and pierced holes in the void.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear came down and pierced through Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s third bloodline appeared and a wisp of energy surged in. Lu Ming roared and his killing intent surged out like a tide as he punched out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist landed on the spear, causing it to tremble and fly back.</p><p>This shocked the other young men who were fighting evenly with the continent.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The other sixth level spiritual God Realm youth shouted. A combat sword appeared above his head. He transformed into a combat sword and slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>Needless to say, their bloodlines were all at the ninth level of the divine level and had reached perfection.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw two consecutive punches at the long spear and the combat sword, sending them both flying and shaking.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The bald burly man’s expression changed drastically, and he was extremely shocked.</p><p>He and Lu Ming were both fifth level spiritual God Realm martial artists. However, he felt that if he were to fight with Lu Ming, he would not be able to withstand even one move from Lu Ming. He was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and continued to attack. He swung his fists continuously and a terrifying force exploded, hitting the combat sword and the long spear continuously.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal being struck rang out as the Battle Sword and the long spear shook continuously.</p><p>“So strong. Is this general Lu’s combat strength? He’s really too strong!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming was at the same level as him, he was already convinced that Lu Ming had defeated him with one move. Now, he admired Lu Ming even more when he went all out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the blood Meridian fusion. He kept punching with both his fists, each of which contained the powerful strength of the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>Ever since he had gotten the fragment of the prison-guarding stele, his prison-guarding sky technique had become more and more powerful. Even if he used the same vital essence, his power was much stronger than before.</p><p>However, he felt that the prison suppressing heaven technique could be even more powerful. There was still a lot of potential that he had not discovered. Lu Ming was trying to understand it as he fought.</p><p>The speed of his punches became slower and slower, but each punch seemed to suppress and imprison everything in the world. It seemed slow, but it was actually extremely fast, forcing the other party to meet force with force.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of explosions continued to ring out as the sword and spear trembled more and more violently. Finally, with two bangs, they exploded and turned back into human figures. Their faces were pale and they spat out blood as they retreated.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>The two of them were at the early stage of the sixth level spiritual God Realm, which was higher than Lu Ming’s cultivation. However, even when the two of them joined forces, they were completely suppressed by Lu Ming and were seriously injured.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“Who are you? Are you a peerless heaven’s favorite of the South God Palace?”</p><p>One of the young men asked.</p><p>They suspected that Lu Ming was a peerless heaven’s favorite cultivated by the South God Palace. Only the Overlord of the divine Ruins could cultivate such a powerful heaven’s favorite!</p><p>“You want to know who I am? You’re not qualified enough. You, leave your storage ring behind and get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the bald young man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
