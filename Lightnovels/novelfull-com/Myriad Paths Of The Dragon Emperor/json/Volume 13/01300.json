Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>...</p><p>Then, the Dragon Claw struck out continuously.</p><p>The attack used by each Dragon Claw was different.</p><p>There was a Dragon Claw that shone with an earthy yellow light. It was the earth element technique.</p><p>A Dragon Claw suffused with lightning transformed into a long spear. That was the lightning origin technique.</p><p>In addition, there were also fire elemental techniques, wind elemental techniques, and water elemental techniques.</p><p>In the test of the chaos Palace, Lu Ming was able to merge five martial arts techniques of creation into one. It was easy for him to cast five martial arts techniques of creation at the same time.</p><p>The nine dragon claws clawed at Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Hai Yu shouted coldly as he tried his best to activate his battle axe. His eyes were ferocious.</p><p>At the same time, the flood Dragon sovereign was also in a similar state, his killing intent cold.</p><p>Lu Ming actually did not escape and wanted to fight with them head-on. This was exactly what they wanted.</p><p>They were overjoyed. They wanted to get rid of Lu Ming in one go.</p><p>“What is Lu Ming doing? He’s looking for death!”</p><p>“That’s not wise!”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle from afar also exclaimed when they saw this scene.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, but that was only for ordinary Supremes. Hai Yu and the flood Dragon Supreme were the top Supremes, and their combat strength was already terrifying enough. It would not be too difficult for them to kill an ordinary Supreme.</p><p>Moreover, they had Emperor spiritual weapons. With them, their combat strength could definitely fight against an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>If Lu Ming was not courting death by fighting head-on with them, what was he?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack finally collided with Hai Yu’s and the Supreme flood Dragon’s attacks.</p><p>At this moment, a violent force swept across tens of thousands of miles. In the ancient city below, countless buildings collapsed and turned into ashes.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle from afar all retreated frantically, afraid of being swept in.</p><p>“Oh my God, look! Lu Ming has the upper hand!”</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm as they retreated.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw two figures rapidly retreating.</p><p>The retreating figures were actually the flood Dragon sovereign and Hai Yu.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign were not Lu Ming’s match and were forced to retreat even though they had both wielded Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed it.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign also roared in disbelief.</p><p>The two of them found it hard to believe. How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>A while ago, Lu Ming was not their match at all. He was completely suppressed by them. Even with the two pets, he was far from being their match.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only disappeared for a short while. When he reappeared, his combat strength had increased sharply and he could easily kill ordinary Supreme-beings. Now, he could actually defeat them without relying on his pets or weapons. What was going on? Could it be that Lu Ming had been hiding his ability all along?</p><p>Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others felt that their brains were unable to process this.</p><p>he must have used some kind of secret technique to increase his combat strength. If we join forces, he won’t be able to hold on for long!</p><p>Hai Yu roared at the flood Dragon Supreme.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign joined forces and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A cold smile appeared in Lu Ming’s eyes. The lightning cauldron appeared above his head and he threw it at Hai Yu, while he himself attacked the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming only used one claw. However, this claw was a fusion of five martial arts techniques of creation.</p><p>When the five martial techniques of creation were combined, the power increased dramatically.</p><p>The Dragon Claw collided with the Dragon vein sword of the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword trembled violently, and the sword Qi dispersed. It then flew far away.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign’s expression changed drastically as he retreated. However, it was already too late. Lu Ming’s attack had arrived.</p><p>It was another claw attack, and it was still the fusion of five martial techniques of creation.</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign also extended his Dragon Claw to block with all his might. However, the instant his Dragon Claw came into contact with Lu Ming’s, it exploded. PU Chi, Lu Ming’s Dragon Claw didn’t stop and pierced through his body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign let out a violent roar, his eyes filled with endless fear. He wanted to struggle and escape, but the other claws of the nine Dragons had already arrived.</p><p>The Dragon claws were imbued with the prison suppressing heavenly art as they smashed into the head of the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With seven to eight consecutive explosions, the head of the flood Dragon sovereign was pierced through and exploded.</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign had fallen!</p><p>The Supreme Being, who had ninety percent of the true dragon’s bloodline, was still killed by Lu Ming despite controlling the Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>if I were to use my Primal Chaos intent, it would be much easier to kill Supreme flood Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cast the chaos concept during the process. At most, he transformed the chaos concept into the concept of Thunder and wind.</p><p>The chaos will was Lu Ming’s trump card. He would not use it unless it was a critical moment.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>On the other side, after Hai Yu and the Thunder cauldron exchanged a blow, he saw the scene of the flood Dragon sovereign being killed. He was so scared that he almost peed his pants. At this moment, there was only one thought in his mind, and that was to run. Run as far away as possible from Lu Ming.</p><p>Hai Yu turned around and ran. He flew toward the exit of the ancient city.</p><p>“Big brother, big brother, take me with you!”</p><p>In the distance, Hai Tian shouted in fear.</p><p>However, Hai Yu was already scared out of his wits. At this moment, he only wanted to save his life. He didn’t care about the sky and sea. He pretended not to hear anything and ran with his head down.</p><p>“Big brother …”</p><p>Hai Tian roared in despair.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming transformed back into his human form. He took a step forward and appeared beside Hai Tian, causing him to scream in fear.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, what are you trying to do? My father is the sea suppressing Marshal. You can’t kill me. If you kill me, you’ll also die …”</p><p>Hai Tian shouted. He was still thinking of threatening Lu Ming at this moment.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a ray of spear radiance shot out. It pierced through Hai Tian’s dantian and shattered his spiritual God.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Hai Tian’s eyes widened and he glared at Lu Ming. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so straightforward. He did not say a word and killed him in one move.</p><p>With a strong unwillingness, the life in Hai Tian’s eyes disappeared.</p><p>The sea demons and the remaining Supreme martial artists in the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion had already fled for their lives.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced in the direction that Hai Yu had fled in. He was not in a hurry to give chase. Instead, he released his essential core and formed a powerful suction force, attracting all the corpses of the Supreme-beings.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram flew out from Lu Ming’s glabella and collected all the corpses of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>The Supreme-being’s corpse contained blood essence. Lu Ming still needed the blood essence to upgrade the bloodline level of the prison-suppressing stele. He could not waste it.</p><p>After putting away the Supreme-being’s corpse, Lu Ming had an idea and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Within the mountain and river diagram, there was a mountain peak filled with the corpses of Supreme martial artists. Xie nianqing and Supreme Thunder rhinoceros stood at the side, dumbfounded.</p><p>Supreme Thunder Rhino’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
