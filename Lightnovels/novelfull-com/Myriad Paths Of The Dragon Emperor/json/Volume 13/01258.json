Without a doubt, Wang Zhen had also used a martial technique of creation.</p><p>...</p><p>The martial technique of conception of holy light.</p><p>This beam of light looked peaceful, but it had the power to destroy everything!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s body, the essential core continued to circulate. With the support of the nine dragon energies, it was filled with explosive power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Activating the prison suppressing heaven technique, Lu Ming’s palm was like a knife as he slashed at the beam of light.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, the light beam was split into two by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“How can there be such a powerful force?”</p><p>Wang Zhen roared in disbelief in his heart.</p><p>In terms of cultivation, his cultivation had reached the middle eighth level spiritual God Realm, which was stronger than Lu Ming’s. After performing the blood fusion and using martial arts techniques of intent, he was still broken by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming had not performed the blood Meridian fusion and had not revealed his strongest combat strength.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming fought with young master Lin, he had more tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Wang Zhen found it hard to accept that he had been able to break through his killing move even before he had unleashed his full power.</p><p>“Holy light nine beheading!”</p><p>The armor on Wang Zhen’s body was extremely bright. The two combat swords in his hands condensed into one and he slashed nine times in a row. The power of the nine Swords stacked up and exploded with a terrifying power.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard as Lu Ming burst out with the nine Dragon bloodline and transformed into Nine Dragons. He stepped out with his dragon claws and continuously clashed with the milky-white sword radiance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After nine consecutive explosions, the milky-white sword radiance shattered into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the nine Dragons launched a series of attacks.</p><p>Some used the prison suppression heavenly art, while others used the Thundergod strike.</p><p>In the air, the shadow of the prison-suppressing stele appeared and pressed down on Wang Zhen. Lightning condensed into a Phoenix, which spread its wings and flew toward Wang Zhen.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The powerful attack landed on Wang Zhen’s armor, causing it to shake violently and let out an unpleasant creak. In the end, it couldn’t bear the heavy load and directly exploded.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Wang Zhen wailed and spat out a large mouthful of blood as he was sent flying.</p><p>With a twist of their bodies, the nine Dragons appeared in front of Wang Zhen in an instant. Their dragon claws struck down and heavily struck on Wang Zhen’s body. Wang Zhen was as weak as a little chick. He was heavily smashed onto the fighting stage, blood spurting out of his mouth like crazy.</p><p>“I admit defeat, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Wang Zhen admitted defeat in humiliation.</p><p>Lu Ming could continue to attack if he did not admit defeat.</p><p>After Wang Zhen admitted defeat, the space around him distorted and his figure was teleported out.</p><p>“Damn it, this bastard!”</p><p>After coming out, Wang Zhen was roaring in his heart.</p><p>He was not confident that he would be eliminated so early. He did not know if he could catch the eyes of the major sects in the yuanlu continent. If he fell behind, he would make Lu Ming pay the price. He swore in his heart.</p><p>“Look, are they sisters? So similar!”</p><p>they really look like each other. And they’re both so beautiful. They’re devastatingly beautiful!</p><p>At this moment, someone shouted.</p><p>Wang Zhen looked toward the source of the voice and saw two female characters on one of the fighting rings.</p><p>One of them was wearing a black dress, while the other was wearing a white dress. They formed a sharp contrast, but their looks were almost exactly the same.</p><p>They were Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>When two identical beauties met, they naturally attracted attention and many people’s gazes. Even the experts from the four forces of the yuanlu continent looked at them with interest.</p><p>“Isn’t this woman Lu Ming’s woman? Hmph, I’ll let nianjun teach her a lesson and avenge me!”</p><p>Wang Zhen thought in his heart.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun stood opposite each other, staring at each other with lightning-like eyes.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them once again engaged in battle, and this time, the victor was bound to be determined.</p><p>Xie nianqing, you’re a weirdo. Today, I’m going to officially eliminate you on behalf of the royal family and the Xie family!</p><p>Xie nianjun spoke coldly, his face still showing his arrogance and disdain.</p><p>“Xie nianjun, don’t put on such a high and mighty expression. Is your bloodline very noble? In my heart, you’re worthless. Today, I’ll completely trample you under my feet and crush your so-called dignity. I’ll let you understand that the Xie family is not worth mentioning!”</p><p>Xie nianqing didn’t back down at all and fought back.</p><p>“There’s no point in talking nonsense, let’s see who’s stronger!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said. A milky white light emanated from her body, similar to Wang Zhen’s. It was a holy light.</p><p>However, Xie nianjun’s holy light was purer and more condensed than Wang Zhen’s.</p><p>“Nine Heavens Holy domain!”</p><p>Xie nianjun made the first move. With a press of her hand, holy light filled the air and formed a force field that enveloped Xie nianqing.</p><p>“This is … The embryonic form of a domain, no, it doesn’t look like it!”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s attack made the experts from the tianshen sect and jiuxiao sword sect raise their eyebrows in surprise.</p><p>The white-haired elder of the divine sky sect was especially delighted. He looked at Xie nianjun with admiration.</p><p>“This move again, break!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was calm. He pointed his finger like a sword and slashed forward.</p><p>Black Lotus flowers formed in front of Xie nianqing’s fingers. Then, the Lotus flowers scattered, and the petals condensed into a Lotus sword in the air, which slashed down at the nine heavenly Saint realm.</p><p>With a plop, the nine Heavens Saint realm was actually cut open by Xie nianqing.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s expression turned ugly. He didn’t expect Xie nianqing to be able to break through her Nine Heavens Saint realm so easily.</p><p>“Your cultivation is too weak!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s indifferent voice came out of his mouth. At the same time, an aura stronger than Xie nianjun’s burst out from his body.</p><p>The aura of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>seventh level of the spiritual God Realm! How can you possibly reach the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm so quickly?!</p><p>Xie nianjun shouted in disbelief.</p><p>During this period of time, she had been very close to Wang Zhen. With the help of the Wang family’s strength, her cultivation had progressed extremely quickly. Furthermore, she had also obtained other opportunities, breaking through the hidden gates one after another and reaching the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>She had originally thought that no one in the divine wilderness continent was her match. She did not even fear Long Chen.</p><p>However, when she saw Lu Ming’s display of power and how even young master Lin, the pride of the deity sect, was not his match, she was shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>It was a heavy blow to her confidence.</p><p>But now, she realized that even Xie nianqing, who she had always looked down on and regarded as an anomaly, had surpassed her and reached the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. She found it hard to accept.</p><p>“So what if you’ve broken through to the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm? I can still defeat you!”</p><p>Xie nianjun shouted, and the figure of a beautiful woman appeared above his head. She was as Holy as a fairy from the nine Heavens.</p><p>She used her bloodline fusion and attacked Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>As Xie nianqing spoke, a force field spread towards Xie nianjun. Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field was much stronger than before.</p><p>As soon as Xie nianjun’s body entered the field, it was as if he had fallen into a quagmire.</p><p>“One thought demonic sky!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pinched his fingers, and demonic Qi soared into the sky. Vast demonic might filled the air, like a Supreme demonic god.</p><p>The demonic aura made Xie nianjun’s heart tremble.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
