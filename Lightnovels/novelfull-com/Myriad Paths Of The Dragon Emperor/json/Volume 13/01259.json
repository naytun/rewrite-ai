The bloodline she had transformed into bloomed with holy light as she used all her strength to slap Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing also raised her hand and lightly slapped out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two palms collided, and the Holy Light was suppressed in an instant. The vast demonic power crushed the Holy Light like a piece of rotten wood.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing waved her hand and a Black Lotus flower condensed and fell on Xie nianjun. Xie nianjun’s bloodline seemed to be under endless pressure. Deep marks appeared on his body and then it dispersed.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s bloodline dispersed and appeared in the rain of light. Her beautiful face was pale and the blood in her mouth was like red plum blossoms.</p><p>Xie nianqing continued to step forward and hit Xie nianjun with his palm. Xie nianqing groaned and spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood. As if he had been electrocuted, he flew far away and fell on the fighting ring.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Outside, Wang Zhen was dumbfounded. He found it hard to believe.</p><p>She had gotten to know Xie nianjun quite well. Not only was he beautiful, but he was also shockingly talented. With the Wang family’s help and her own fortuitous encounter, his cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds. In just a few months, he had reached the sixth level spiritual God Realm. Even he felt inferior to such talent.</p><p>He had thought that Xie nianqing would win, but he didn’t expect Xie nianjun to lose so easily.</p><p>this woman is born to be a demon. My Tian Yu demon sect wants her!</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect’s expert looked at Xie nianqing with a glint in his eyes.</p><p>her cultivation level is only higher. The other girl is not bad either. My Tian Shen sect wants her!</p><p>The white-haired elder from the Tian Shen sect looked at Xie nianjun.</p><p>Around them, the others were envious. The assessment was not over yet, but the two of them had already been decided by the two major forces. They would definitely be able to join the two major forces, no matter what the assessment would be.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>On the fighting ring, Xie nianjun cried out in disbelief. Her hair was disheveled and she looked extremely disheveled. She did not look like the peerless Princess or goddess at all.</p><p>As proud as she was, she found it hard to accept this result.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, she was high and mighty, second only to Long Chen. She was ranked second.</p><p>Since she was young, she had been shrouded in an endless Halo, like a moon surrounded by stars. She was the focus of the world.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing was the complete opposite. He was ostracized by the royal family and disdained by the Xie family. He didn’t even have the chance to show his face in front of the public. Compared to Xie nianjun, they were like heaven and earth.</p><p>In the past, she had never thought that Xie nianqing would one day defeat her. So, when the day came, she was at a loss, as if she was in a dream.</p><p>“What pure blood of the Xie family? in our eyes, it’s all you self-righteous people who are deceiving yourselves. In fact, you can’t even withstand a single blow.”</p><p>I’ve defeated you today, and I’ll defeat Xie Qitian in the future as well. I’ll let the world know that your so-called pure bloodline is just a joke. So, I won’t kill you today. Get lost!</p><p>As Xie nianqing spoke, he waved his hand and a gust of wind blew Xie nianjun away.</p><p>The space distorted and Xie nianjun was teleported out.</p><p>“Nianjun, are you alright?”</p><p>As soon as Xie nianjun appeared, Wang Zhen flew over and greeted him.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said, but his eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>“You lost too?” he looked at Wang Zhen and asked. Who did you meet?”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wang Zhen hesitated for a moment before finally gritting his teeth and saying.</p><p>“Lu Ming again!” Xie nianjun clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, the battles on the various fighting rings had almost come to an end.</p><p>Those who could reach this stage were all very strong, but compared to the small group of people at the top, the gap was also very obvious, so the battle did not take very long.</p><p>At this point, there were only twenty-five people left.</p><p>Each of these 25 people was extremely powerful. For example, the top geniuses of the four divine palaces, as well as the geniuses of the second and third continents.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that there were also many dark horses.</p><p>Among the 25 people, only 18 of them had stepped onto the Phecda peak previously. The remaining seven were newcomers such as Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Xie nianqing seem to be from the same continent!”</p><p>At this moment, someone spoke out in bewilderment.</p><p>“No way? From the same continent? That’s impossible. Apart from the divine Ruins continent, there were only three people from the blood Sun continent who could make it to this point. If these three people came from the same continent, wouldn’t they be on par with the blood Sun continent? By the way, which continent did they come from?”</p><p>I know, they are from the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>“What? Divine wilderness continent? That’s impossible, right? That small continent?”</p><p>There were sounds of discussion all around. When everyone found out that Lu Ming and the other two were from the divine wilderness continent, they were all dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>A single divine wilderness continent could actually give birth to so many elites?</p><p>Furthermore, Xie nianjun should also be from the divine wilderness continent and had already been chosen by the tianshen sect. If that was the case, the divine wilderness continent would be too shocking.</p><p>Outside, the crowd was discussing in surprise. Lu Ming and the rest had already stepped into the void passage behind.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming stepped into the void channel, he was faced with a storm of attacks.</p><p>One figure after another condensed and charged toward Lu Ming. At the same time, inscriptions filled the void passage, forming an even more terrifying attack.</p><p>This trial tested nothing but pure combat power and combat experience. If one wanted to pass this trial, they would have to keep going.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with his dragon power and crushed his way through. However, the further he went, the stronger the attacks were and the greater the resistance.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s combat strength, he had to put in some effort.</p><p>Outside the void passage, there were flashes of light from time to time. It was experts being eliminated and transported out.</p><p>it can’t be. This stage is so difficult that even a genius like him was eliminated!</p><p>Some people were secretly shocked.</p><p>To be able to make it this far and enter the top 25, they were all extremely talented people. However, there were still people who were constantly eliminated. It could be seen that this round was really too difficult.</p><p>that’s dried blood, the second strongest heaven’s favorite in the land of Blood Sun!</p><p>there’s also the Ice Dragon, one of the four strongest geniuses of the North God Palace. Even he was eliminated. This is too shocking.</p><p>The space flickered continuously as elites were transported out.</p><p>Ice Dragon’s face was gloomy. He couldn’t even pass the level, which made him feel extremely embarrassed.</p><p>did you all notice? the three from the divine wilderness continent have not been eliminated!</p><p>it’s true. Don’t tell me that they’ll be able to clear it? that’s too unbelievable!</p><p>Some people thought of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people were eliminated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
