It was very eye-catching.</p><p>The crowd looked over and saw a fighting ring in the light spot. A young man stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“That’s the northern deity Palace’s ice sky!”</p><p>I didn’t expect him to be the first to break through the first stage. He’s the strongest heaven’s favorite among the younger generation of the North God Palace.</p><p>“You really live up to your reputation!”</p><p>Many people sighed as they recognized this young man.</p><p>The North divine Palace was the most powerful force among the four great divine palaces. As the number one genius of the North divine Palace, there was no need to doubt his strength. He was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>After arriving at the fighting ring, Bing Kong sat down cross-legged and waited quietly.</p><p>Now that he was alone, he couldn’t continue down. He had to wait for the other void passages to converge with his and for others to come to this battle platform. The two of them would fight and the winner would be able to continue down.</p><p>At this moment, another light spot appeared in another direction. There was also a fighting ring in the light spot.</p><p>A young man with a zither on his back stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>This young man had a slender figure and was refined. He had a faint smile on his face and looked like an elegant young master.</p><p>Eden, the most powerful heaven’s favorite of the eastern God Palace!</p><p>“Eden with the sound of Phoenix zither and Phoenix cry!”</p><p>Someone spoke out, revealing the origin of this person. This person’s reputation was no less than that of ice sky.</p><p>Eden, with his zither on his back, also stood in the fighting ring and waited quietly.</p><p>Almost at the same time, two spots of light appeared in the void. Just like before, the two spots of light were battle stages.</p><p>A young man stepped out from each of them.</p><p>One of them had purple hair and a heroic spirit. He was the number one genius of the South God Palace, Zi Wuji.</p><p>The other person carried a combat sword on his back. He was like a divine sword that had been unsheathed, and his sword Qi soared to the sky. This person was the strongest heaven’s favorite of the Western deity Palace, Jian Zhan.</p><p>The most powerful heaven’s favorites of the four divine palaces had all appeared on their respective battle platforms. It was obvious that their space passages did not converge in the first round.</p><p>In the void passage, Lu Ming continued to avoid the black-robed young man’s attacks. At the same time, he was thinking of a way to break the attack.</p><p>“The surroundings, those carvings on the stone walls …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The carvings on the stone walls were very intriguing. Upon closer inspection, it seemed to be a spear technique.</p><p>It was an extremely wondrous spear technique.</p><p>As Lu Ming dodged the black-robed youth’s attacks, he studied the carvings in detail. In Lu Ming’s eyes, the carvings started to change. Slowly, there seemed to be a figure practicing spear techniques.</p><p>this spear technique can break this young man’s spear technique!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up after a while.</p><p>He finally knew what this test was about. It was about one’s comprehension.</p><p>The purpose of suppressing one’s cultivation, intent, and bloodline was to allow the participants to comprehend a spear technique from the carvings on the stone wall so that they could break the opponent’s spear technique.</p><p>Of course, not everyone was skilled in spear techniques. Some people were skilled in sword techniques, and they might encounter sword techniques.</p><p>Once the key point was discovered, it was not difficult for Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s comprehension was already very amazing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming shook the long spear in his hand. A sharp spear ray shot out like lightning and collided with the black-robed young man’s long spear.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>A series of violent sounds rang out, and in the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>as expected, he can break the opponent’s martial technique!</p><p>The more Lu Ming used it, the faster his speed became. The long spear was like a Black Dragon, dancing in the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After a dozen more moves, the long spear in Lu Ming’s hands turned into a Black Lightning, breaking through the opponent’s heavy spear screen and stabbing his heart.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black-robed youth exploded.</p><p>The first stage, passed!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out. After crossing the passage, there was a bright light in front of him. It was a fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and walked onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s still me alone. Looks like I’ll have to wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he sat cross-legged on the fighting ring.</p><p>Outside, the onlookers had also seen Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming is indeed impressive. He’s the sixth to clear the first level!”</p><p>for an elite of the divine wilderness continent to be able to do this, it’s truly shocking.</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Just now, after the four most powerful heaven’s favorites of the four directions divine Palace stepped onto the battle stage, the number one heaven’s favorite of the blood Sun continent, the second-ranked continent in the continent group of the divine Ruins, followed closely behind them.</p><p>The number one heaven’s favorite of the blood Sun continent was the fifth to step into the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming was the sixth to step into the fighting ring.</p><p>After a while, more and more light spots appeared in the void.</p><p>The other powerful heaven’s favorites of the four directions divine Palace, such as ice cold, Ji hongchen, Wang Zhen, and so on.</p><p>Long Chen also stepped into the fighting ring around the same time as the other geniuses.</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and the others also appeared.</p><p>As long as the key point was discovered in the first stage, it would not be too difficult.</p><p>Although many people were eliminated, there were even more people who succeeded.</p><p>“There’s a convergence of space passages!”</p><p>Someone said,</p><p>Sure enough, a spot of light flashed, and a hole appeared on the side of the fighting ring. A young man stepped out of it.</p><p>There were two people in the fighting ring.</p><p>The two of them had to fight. The winner would continue, and the loser would be eliminated.</p><p>The two of them soon engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>After that, more and more space passages started to merge.</p><p>Of course, they were all successful. It was impossible for them to fail.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged when the fighting ring suddenly shook. A tunnel entrance appeared on one side of the fighting ring. A young figure appeared from the tunnel.</p><p>The man walked out of the passage and stepped into the fighting ring. His expression changed drastically when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>He had witnessed Lu Ming’s shocking combat strength when he fought young master Lin.</p><p>His combat ability was worlds apart from Lu Ming’s.</p><p>what bad luck! I’ve met this freak in the first round!</p><p>The young man’s mouth was filled with bitterness and helplessness.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked toward the young man.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know I’m not your match, but I’ll do my best to fight you!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>This was not an ordinary battle. It was a major sect in the yuanlu continent recruiting disciples. He could not admit defeat. No matter what, he had to fight.</p><p>As long as he displayed himself to his heart’s content, perhaps he would be noticed by the powerhouses of the major sects in the yuan continent.</p><p>After all, the major sects of the yuanlu continent did not recruit disciples. They only recruited disciples based on combat strength. No one knew the criteria for recruiting disciples.</p><p>What if he was chosen?</p><p>“Do what you want, I’ll give you the chance to attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The other party cupped his fists. Then, he performed the blood Meridian fusion and burst out with his strongest combat strength, attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Although the young man’s cultivation was not bad, he was still far from Lu Ming’s level. Lu Ming did not defeat him in a single blow. Instead, he let the young man display his strongest combat strength before he defeated him.</p><p>The other party was extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
