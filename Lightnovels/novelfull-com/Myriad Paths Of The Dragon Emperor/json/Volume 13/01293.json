At this time, his eyes had regained their clarity. The killing intent in his eyes had completely disappeared. There was only calmness and peace.</p><p>...</p><p>The people around him were still attacking Lu Ming. Lu Ming took a step forward and his essential core burst forth, condensing into an endless spear light. He pierced through the people and killed them all.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming’s heart did not waver at all.</p><p>On this path filled with killing, he would no longer be controlled by killing and become a killing machine.</p><p>In the hall, Earth One, gold one, and the others smiled when they saw this.</p><p>“He passed the first test!”</p><p>Earth One said with a smile.</p><p>“Although I passed the first stage, the later stages are even more difficult!”</p><p>Gold one sighed.</p><p>“Don’t rush, take it one step at a time!” Earth One said.</p><p>The others nodded and continued to watch.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not stop. Endless spear radiance burst forth from his body. He traveled dozens of miles with each step. With every step he took, everything that stood in his way was turned into ashes.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the surrounding environment changed again. Lu Ming was back in the passageway.</p><p>“Congratulations on passing the first stage!”</p><p>A voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>After that, there was no more sound.</p><p>“This is only the first stage? It’s really difficult!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>After entering this passage, there would be endless killing intent that would suddenly descend on them. Then, they would enter the illusion and lose themselves in the killing. Initially, Lu Ming thought that this was already the second stage. He did not expect that it was only the first stage.</p><p>The first stage was already so difficult. Who knew what they would face in the future?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with confidence and fighting spirit. He strode forward.</p><p>The passage was very long and seemed to have no end. Lu Ming walked for half an hour and the passage in front suddenly became wide, like a stone room.</p><p>The stone room was filled with dense and mysterious carvings. One could faintly feel the aura of the earth.</p><p>In front of the stone room, there was a yellow light curtain blocking the way.</p><p>on the walls, there is the earth essence martial technique, the earth Aeon technique. Only those who have successfully cultivated the earth Aeon technique can break through the light curtain. You can only pass this stage if you have successfully comprehended the earth Aeon technique on the walls. You only have half a year!</p><p>The voice from before rang in Lu Ming’s mind again.</p><p>“Martial skill of earth essence, earth origin technique? To successfully cultivate it in half a year?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The assessment this time was a martial arts technique of the creation of the earth. Furthermore, it would take half a year. Lu Ming was absolutely confident.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the carvings on the wall and he began to comprehend them in detail.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, the carvings seemed to come to life. They were like tiny snakes slithering on the wall, turning into wonderful martial arts techniques.</p><p>Earth concept martial technique!</p><p>“How wonderful!”</p><p>As soon as he looked at it, Lu Ming felt that this martial arts technique of creation was extremely wonderful and mysterious. It seemed to contain the truth of heaven and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming had previously cultivated the martial arts technique, Thundergod strike, with the concept of Thunder.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the Thundergod strike was already astonishingly high. It was a hundred times more difficult than ordinary martial arts techniques.</p><p>However, the difficulty level of the earth Aeon technique was much higher than that of the Thundergod strike.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there and observed it carefully for three days, but he still could not find any clues.</p><p>It was no wonder that he would be able to pass the test as long as he succeeded in cultivating it within half a year. The difficulty of cultivation was simply too great.</p><p>In the hall, Earth One, gold one, and the others watched quietly.</p><p>“I wonder if this kid can successfully comprehend it within half a year!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“If you really need half a year to successfully comprehend it, then there’s no hope for the later stages.”</p><p>Gold one said.</p><p>that’s right. Based on past experience, the shorter the time used, the greater the chances of success. Some people only managed to comprehend it in half a year, or even five months. This shows that their potential is limited, and they will definitely fail in the later stages!</p><p>Earth One sighed.</p><p>The shorter the time he took to pass this checkpoint, the greater the hope he would have in the future.</p><p>in the past, the person who used the shortest time was three months and fifteen days, but he still didn’t reach the end. In my opinion, only if he successfully comprehended it within three months will he have the hope of passing the test!</p><p>Gold one said.</p><p>Everyone fell silent, and the atmosphere seemed a little heavy.</p><p>It was already quite good to be able to comprehend it in half a year. To comprehend it in three months was simply too difficult.</p><p>In the stone room, Lu Ming was still motionless, carefully sensing the carvings around him.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, those marks seemed to have turned into tiny people who were practicing the martial arts technique of the creation of the earth and the earth Aeon technique.</p><p>the core of the martial technique of conception is the conception. The potential and power of the conception can be fully exerted. The power can be exerted by ten times or even a hundred times. Therefore, to practice the martial technique of conception, one must start from the conception!</p><p>Slowly, Lu Ming closed his eyes. The tiny figures formed by the marks disappeared, leaving only the will of the earth in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>Slowly, the earth essence realm and the marks began to overlap.</p><p>In this place, one could not use the path-understanding ancient tree to comprehend. One could only rely on oneself.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>Five days, ten days, a month …</p><p>After a month and a half, Lu Ming suddenly moved. He took a step forward and the ground let out a dull roar. At the same time, he threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was as heavy as a mountain and as powerful as a Thunderbolt. It seemed to suppress everything and had a feeling of the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>“Yes, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He kept swinging his fists and the void rumbled and exploded.</p><p>In the main hall, Earth One, gold one, and the others ‘eyes lit up.</p><p>that’s fast! It’s only been half a month, and he’s already grasped the technique!</p><p>amazing. It’s too amazing. Although he has only touched the door, it has only been one and a half months. He really has a chance to succeed in the training in three months!</p><p>“Hahaha, there’s hope!”</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the others exclaimed excitedly, their eyes revealing a strong sense of hope.</p><p>They had waited for too long and did not want to wait any longer.</p><p>In the stone room, Lu Ming was practicing non-stop, seemingly without stopping.</p><p>Time continued to pass.</p><p>The power of Lu Ming’s punches grew stronger and stronger, and the world trembled with his punches.</p><p>Two and a half months had passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the earth concept burst forth with the fist force. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>The earth element technique. This was the earth element technique. Lu Ming had successfully cultivated it.</p><p>Although they were both artistic conception martial skills, the earth Aeon skill was obviously at a higher level than the Thundergod strike, and it was more powerful as well. Although it was only at the first level, its power was equivalent to the second level of the Thundergod strike.</p><p>two and a half months. I don’t know what level he’s at. Let’s get through this first!</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled to himself. He then stepped forward and came before the khaki-colored light screen. He threw a punch.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The khaki-colored light screen shattered like glass, turning into light spots and dissipating. Lu Ming walked over and continued forward.</p><p>Behind the light screen, there was still a passage, but not long after, Lu Ming came to another stone room.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
