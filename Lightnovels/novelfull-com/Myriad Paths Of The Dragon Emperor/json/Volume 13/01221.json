It was completely golden, just like gold, but it gave off a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>...</p><p>The earth Emperor’s essence was one of the main spiritual materials to refine the Nirvana elixir. Lu Ming had never expected that he would find it in an ancient mine in the divine Ruins.</p><p>How could Lu Ming not be happy?</p><p>After obtaining this piece of earth Emperor’s essence, he was only missing one of the seven main ingredients to refine the Nirvana elixir. As long as he gathered all seven main ingredients, the other supplementary ingredients would be easy to find.</p><p>At that time, he would be able to start refining the Nirvana pill.</p><p>“That’s an earth Emperor Goblin!”</p><p>it’s really a piece of Emperor earth essence. We’ve made a huge profit. A piece of Emperor earth essence is worth tens of millions of raw stones!</p><p>my luck is too good. It’s only the first piece, and I’ve already found a treasure!</p><p>The people around the square also recognized the earth Emperor Goblin, and they all exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>damn it, this Lu Ming. How can he be so lucky? he actually got a treasure!</p><p>Mujue’s face was gloomy and his eyes were cold.</p><p>He was very clear in his heart that every piece of these Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines had been carefully sensed by the MU family’s experts before they took it out after examining it. As long as there was a possibility of obtaining a treasure from the divine Ruins’ ancient mine, the MU family would keep it.</p><p>There might be fish that slipped through the net among the thousands of Divine Ruins ancient mines here, and there might be treasures contained within, but there were very few. There might not even be a few of them even if the thousands of them were added up.</p><p>However, Lu Ming managed to cut out a piece of it at once. Moreover, it was worth tens of millions of raw stones. Mujue felt a little heartache. He had only earned a few million raw stones by selling dozens of useless Divine Ruins ancient mines just now.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade box in joy and put the earth Emperor essence away carefully. Then, his eyes lit up and he scanned the other ancient mines in the divine Ruins. He laughed at the same time. hahaha, I’m so lucky today. It seems like I have to choose another one!</p><p>After saying that, he began to wander around the pile of old mines.</p><p>Hmph, you’re just lucky. Choose, choose. I don’t believe you can still choose!</p><p>Mujue thought.</p><p>Lu Ming wandered around for a while and randomly picked up an old mine.”This is it!”</p><p>After grabbing it, he walked to the MU family and paid a hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>“Let’s cut it open and see!”</p><p>Someone jeered.</p><p>Many people were very curious about Lu Ming’s ability to obtain a treasure on the first piece. They wanted to know if he would be able to obtain a treasure on the second piece.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He condensed his essential core and started to cut.</p><p>it’s impossible to get another treasure this time. The first piece just now was just luck. In stone gambling, very few people can get it right twice in a row.</p><p>Someone said. But the next moment, his mouth was wide open and he was dumbfounded.</p><p>That was because the old mine in Lu Ming’s hand was emitting a ray of Crimson light that was extremely dazzling.</p><p>Many people were stunned, and then there was a burst of noise.</p><p>“Treasure, another treasure has appeared!”</p><p>he actually managed to obtain two treasures in a row. This is really rare. This person’s luck is too heaven-defying!</p><p>a drop of blood, a drop of blood essence. What a strong power of blood essence!</p><p>“It’s actually a drop of blood essence!” Lu Ming himself was a little stunned. He carefully cut open the ancient mine. A drop of sparkling and resplendent blood essence that was like a blood-colored gem appeared in Lu Ming’s palm. It exuded an extremely rich power of blood essence.</p><p>This was absolutely an extremely powerful existence. After death, under a lucky coincidence, the blood essence was sealed into the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, and was passed down from there, its value immeasurable.</p><p>If this was used to refine pills and unleash the energy within the blood essence, it would definitely be of great help to a cultivator’s cultivation.</p><p>“It’s actually a drop of blood essence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes also shone.</p><p>He was currently lacking blood essence to improve his Blood Meridian. Lu Ming had a feeling that if he refined this drop of blood essence, his Blood Meridian would definitely improve greatly.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Mujue’s eyes widened and he subconsciously crushed a purple jade teacup in his hand.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Mujue roared in his heart.</p><p>This drop of blood essence was even more valuable than the earth Emperor essence. He felt that he had made a huge loss. How good would it be if they could cut it out themselves?</p><p>Now, it was chosen by someone else and it was Lu Ming. Mu Jue was so angry that he gritted his teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud. He took out a Jade bottle and kept the drop of blood essence. He muttered,”Luck, luck, I’m really lucky today. Haha, let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze started to dart around the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine again.</p><p>Mu Jue and the rest of the MU family could not help but feel their hearts skip a beat. They were a little nervous, worried that they would be selected by Lu Ming to the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine that contained treasures again.</p><p>Mu Jue wanted to stop Lu Ming from continuing to choose. However, they were doing business. Under the watchful eyes of the public, what reason did they have to stop Lu Ming from continuing to choose?</p><p>He could only hope that Lu Ming was just lucky the first two times and that he would not be able to pick any more.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming picked faster. After a few casual glances, he picked an old mine and paid a hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>“Cut, cut it open and see!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, take a look!”</p><p>Many people shouted in excitement.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained treasures twice in a row. Would he obtain treasures three times in a row?</p><p>Mu Jue and the other members of the MU family were also staring at the scene with their eyes wide open.</p><p>impossible, it’s impossible that there’s still more. All of the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines here don’t have that many treasures either!</p><p>Mujue kept praying in his heart.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming’s essential core was like a knife and he began to cut. After a few consecutive cuts, the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine cracked open. A faint brilliance was emitted, and along with the brilliance, there was also an extremely strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>The crowd was stunned. After a while, they burst into a loud noise.</p><p>Another treasure appeared. Another treasure actually appeared. Three times in a row. This was too shocking.</p><p>Could it be that this time, the MU family really found their conscience and took out so many high-quality Divine Ruins ancient mines?</p><p>As Lu Ming continued to cut it open, the treasures in the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine also revealed their true colors.</p><p>It was a spiritual herb, purple in color like a lotus flower. An indescribable fluctuation was emitted from it, and the medicinal fragrance was extremely strong.</p><p>“This … ‘This …’ Could it be a Saint herb?”</p><p>A white-haired old man exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>“Sacred medicine? How is that possible?”</p><p>“Heavens, that’s impossible!”</p><p>The others followed suit and exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>What was a sacred medicine? It was a Supreme treasure that had surpassed level nine spirit herbs, and even Saints could use it. Even emperors would go crazy and kill each other when they saw it.</p><p>Many people’s eyes shone with a fiery light as they stared at the purple Lotus in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>that’s not right. It’s not a sacred medicine. It hasn’t fully evolved. It’s a half-sacred medicine. Furthermore, it’s been sealed for many years. Most of its spiritual essence has been lost. What a pity!</p><p>The white-haired old man carefully identified it, shook his head, and sighed.</p><p>“So it’s not a sacred medicine!” Some people let out a long breath, but many people’s eyes were still shining.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t a Saint herb, but a half-Saint herb, and it had lost most of its spirituality, it was still a Supreme treasure. Its value was immeasurable, and it was at least in the units of hundreds of millions of raw gemstones.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
