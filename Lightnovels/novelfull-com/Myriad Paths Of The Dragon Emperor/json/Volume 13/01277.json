Some of them were from the other big families and forces of the South God Palace. They were not afraid of the sea suppressing Marshal.</p><p>Hai Tian rolled his eyes and pondered for a moment. He said, alright, you can all attack together. After breaking the poison gas formation, the pure spirit bodies can fight for the map with their own abilities!</p><p>He had brought five Supreme martial artists with him and was confident in his ability to suppress the crowd.</p><p>“Haha, count me in!”</p><p>“Add me!”</p><p>At this moment, a few more voices could be heard as a few figures appeared. Each of them had a terrifying aura, and they were all Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Lu Ming was standing not far away. A thousand miles behind him, the martial artists of the perfected spiritual God Realm, ninth level spiritual God Realm, and eighth level spiritual God Realm were watching from afar.</p><p>so many Supreme martial artists! I really don’t know how many Supreme martial artists have been attracted this time!</p><p>there are more than ten people in front. There are definitely more!</p><p>“With so many Supreme martial artists, the hundred poisons Supreme won’t be able to keep his map!”</p><p>Some of them were discussing among themselves as they stared ahead in excitement.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Supreme martial artists who came later all exploded one by one. Their terrifying auras soared into the sky, stirring up huge holes in the sky. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>A bright light flashed, and all kinds of terrifying attacks burst out, blasting towards the poison gas formation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky was shattered like tofu under the attack of the Supreme martial artist. All kinds of attacks, accompanied by spatial storms, fell on the poison gas array.</p><p>With so many Supreme martial artists taking action, they were going to use powerful means to break the poison gas formation.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The poisonous gas of the poisonous gas formation was also extremely terrifying. When it came into contact with those attacks, it gave off a sizzling sound, as if it was corroding those attacks.</p><p>However, although the poison gas formation was powerful, there were a total of eight Supreme martial artists attacking.</p><p>The power of the eight Supreme martial artists ‘attack was too astonishing. It could destroy the heavens and earth. Although the poison formation was strong, it couldn’t withstand such a powerful attack.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The poisonous gas rolled and was annihilated by the terrifying attack, turning into nothing.</p><p>The multi-colored poisonous gas in front of him slowly faded and was slowly annihilated.</p><p>Then, some of the inscriptions crumbled one by one under the terrifying power.</p><p>The inscriptions collapsed and the formation collapsed even faster. The poisonous gas dissipated even faster.</p><p>The poison gas formation was about to be broken.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure wrapped in black poisonous gas broke through the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>“Hundred poisons Paragon! It’s hundred poisons Paragon! Stop him!”</p><p>Hai Tian shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, the eight Supreme martial artists executed extremely fast movement techniques and chased after the hundred poisons Supreme. All kinds of attacks were launched at the hundred poisons Supreme.</p><p>Hundred poisons Supreme was helpless and could only try his best to Dodge. As a result, his speed was greatly reduced, and he was surrounded by the eight Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Bai du, hand over the map of the pure spirit body. Otherwise, you won’t be able to escape death!</p><p>Hai Tian shouted as he rushed over with the two Supreme martial artists beside him.</p><p>hahaha, what a joke. Why should I give it to you? I paid a huge price to get the map for the pure spirit body. Why should I give it to you? ”</p><p>Hundred poisons master laughed crazily.</p><p>“Hmph, if you don’t give it to me today, you’ll die!”</p><p>Hai Tian sneered.</p><p>Hmph, you’re just a piece of trash. If you didn’t have a powerful father, I could kill you with a single breath!</p><p>Hundred poisons master looked at Hai Tian with disdain.</p><p>“You’re looking for death. Attack and kill this person!”</p><p>Hai Tian’s face was flushed red as he roared.</p><p>Hai Tian’s talent was very ordinary. He had only awakened an eighth-rank divine bloodline, which was far inferior to the top geniuses. He was not even qualified to participate in the disciple selection of the heavenly God sect. This was a sore point in his heart.</p><p>He was proud and arrogant, and he hated it the most when people said that his talent was inferior to others. If they said anything about him, they would die.</p><p>Hundred poisons master dared to call him trash, which was a big taboo for him.</p><p>The three Supreme martial artists who took orders from Hai Tian immediately attacked hundred poisons Supreme.</p><p>Three terrifying attacks enveloped hundred poisons Supreme.</p><p>A hint of ruthlessness appeared on hundred poisons Supreme’s face as he cut off one of his arms. As soon as the arm fell, it turned into a seven-colored poisonous gas and spread on the spot.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The faces of those Supreme martial artists turned green as soon as they were hit by the poisonous gas.</p><p>The other Supreme martial artists also retreated.</p><p>Hundred poisons master wanted to take this opportunity to break out of the siege.</p><p>“Attack! Don’t let him escape! Attack!”</p><p>Hai Tian roared.</p><p>The Supreme martial artists who were under Hai Tian’s command did not care about the poisonous gas and attacked with all their might to stop hundred poisons Supreme.</p><p>The other Supreme martial artists also reacted and attacked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A violent boom rang out between heaven and earth. The Supreme-beings were exchanging blows with astonishing power.</p><p>However, the hundred poisons Paragon was only one person, after all, and there was no way he could escape. After a few moves, he was severely injured and spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>the map of the pure spirit bodies. Here you go!</p><p>In the end, hundred poisons Supreme had no choice but to take off the storage ring on his finger and throw it to one of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>This Supreme martial artist was not Hai Tian’s subordinate.</p><p>When he saw the storage ring, he was overjoyed. He grabbed it in his hand and retreated.</p><p>“Hand it over!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The other paragons roared as they cast aside Paragon hundred poisons and charged toward the Paragon.</p><p>The hundred poisons Paragon retreated far away, his body seething with poisonous gas as he tried his best to recuperate. However, he didn’t leave just like that. It was obvious that he was unwilling to hand over the map and was waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>you dare to snatch from me? I’ll kill whoever snatches from me. Kill them!</p><p>Hai Tian roared.</p><p>The eight Supreme-beings were engaged in a chaotic battle. The battle was extremely intense, and the terrifying energy swept in all directions.</p><p>The hundred poisons Paragon’s storage ring could be taken by one person or another, and no one could keep it for themselves. Whoever got it would be surrounded.</p><p>“I’d like to see what this map looks like.”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered as he stepped forward, heading towards the battlefield of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>“That kid, what does he want to do? He actually walked forward, he’s really looking for death!”</p><p>does he also want to fight for the map? what a joke! He’s overestimating himself!</p><p>In the distance, the martial artists who were watching the battle were stunned at first, but then they sneered.</p><p>Hai Tian was also slightly stunned. Then, he revealed a ferocious expression and said, ” “Brat, you’re looking for death. Kill him!”</p><p>At the edge of the sea and sky, a Supreme-being nodded and waved his palm. A saber-light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Hai Tian. He suddenly sped up to avoid the saber Light and rushed toward the Supreme martial artist battlefield.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>On the battlefield, a Supreme martial artist who took orders from Hai Tian threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw a punch at his opponent.</p><p>“Haha, this brat actually dares to exchange blows with a Supreme martial artist …”</p><p>Someone sneered, but before he could finish his sentence, he was stunned.</p><p>At the scene, the others were also stunned and tongue-tied.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
