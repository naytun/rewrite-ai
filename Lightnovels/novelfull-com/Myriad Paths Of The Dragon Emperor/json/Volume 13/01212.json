He felt as if his entire body was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Long Chen!”</p><p>Mujue gritted his teeth. This time, their losses were too great. They had lost more than a dozen eighth and ninth level spiritual God experts, and two perfected spiritual God experts.</p><p>They were all advanced spiritual gods. Even if there were many experts in the divine Ruins, he would be punished by his father if he lost so many of them at once.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The space suddenly split open and a middle-aged man stepped out.</p><p>“Elder rain, is that you?”</p><p>Seeing this middle-aged man, mu Jue’s eyes lit up and he became excited.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist. The MU family’s Supreme martial artist had arrived.</p><p>He finally knew why Lu Ming and the rest had fled in a hurry. They must have sensed the arrival of the Supreme-being and fled.</p><p>“Young master, what’s going on?”</p><p>Supreme Dancing Rain frowned when he saw the sorry state mu Jue and the others were in.</p><p>“Someone killed a member of the MU family! Elder rain, they’re right in front of us. They didn’t get far. Let’s chase after them and kill them!”</p><p>Mujue shouted.</p><p>“Who dares to kill my Mu family’s people? Young master, I’ll take you with me!”</p><p>Supreme Dancing Rain swept mu Jue with her vital essence and tore the space apart. She stepped into the space with mu Jue and chased after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Long Chen Ran at top speed.</p><p>“A Paragon is coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Long Chen’s expression changed drastically. Although he had no idea how Lu Ming was able to sense the presence of a Supreme-being, with their current strength, they would definitely die if they were to face a Supreme-being.</p><p>The two of them were extremely fast, like two bolts of lightning cutting through the void.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already transformed into Nine Dragons. The nine Dragons stomped in the air at an astonishing speed.</p><p>As for the Archean dragonesque elephant that Long Chen had transformed into, although it was huge and had immense strength, its speed was also terrifyingly fast. As the elephant’s legs stomped down, the void exploded. One step was a thousand miles.</p><p>The direction the two of them were heading was the core direction of the divine Ruins.</p><p>“Not good! Hurry up! That Supreme martial artist is catching up!”</p><p>Dandan anxiously urged.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. Together with Long Chen, they used all their strength to rush forward.</p><p>When Lu Ming heard that the Supreme-being was coming, he flew towards the core of the divine Ruins without hesitation.</p><p>If they had tried to escape in any other direction, they definitely wouldn’t have been able to escape. Supremes could tear through space, and no matter how fast they were, they wouldn’t be able to outrun Supremes. They would definitely be caught.</p><p>The only way to survive was the divine Ruins core.</p><p>Although the divine Ruins ‘core was rumored to be very dangerous, he could only take a gamble.</p><p>“We’re almost there!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The area in front of them was filled with a blood-colored mist. From afar, it looked misty.</p><p>That was the core region of the divine Ruins, the legendary forbidden area, where anyone who entered would die.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Long Chen had no choice but to hide in there for the time being.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them were decisive people. Without any hesitation, they rushed into the blood-red area and disappeared.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Just as the two of them entered the core region, the space outside the core region split open. Supreme Dancing Rain stepped out of the spatial crack with mu Jue.</p><p>young master, they’ve entered the core area!</p><p>Supreme bath frowned.</p><p>Humph, even emperors will die if they enter the core area. If they go in, they’ll be dead for sure. It’s a pity that they died like this. It’s too good for them!</p><p>Mujue’s face revealed a ferocious expression as he gritted his teeth.</p><p>He had wanted to take down Lu Ming and Long Chen and make them wish they were dead.</p><p>And that Xie nianqing, such a beauty, he originally wanted to take her down and enjoy her, but now, he could only let them die.</p><p>The divine Ruins ‘core region, they naturally did not dare to enter, because even emperors would die if they entered. It was too strange and too dangerous.</p><p>However, mujue was still worried. “Elder rain, please guard this place for half a month. Since ancient times, no one has been able to survive in the core region for more than half a month. If they still don’t come out after half a month, it means that they’re dead!”</p><p>alright, young master. Don’t worry!</p><p>Supreme Dancing Rain nodded.</p><p>After that, mu Jue waited there for a day. After a day, Lu Ming and the others still did not come out, so mu Jue went back alone, leaving Supreme Dancing Rain to guard the place.</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Long Chen rushed into the core area of the divine Ruins, it was as if the stars had shifted, and the environment behind them suddenly changed.</p><p>“Eh? What’s going on?”</p><p>The two of them stopped at the same time and looked back. Behind them, there was a blood mist, and they couldn’t see the specific situation at all.</p><p>Logically speaking, even though there was a blood-colored mist here, they should still be able to see some things with their eyesight. But now, it was all hazy.</p><p>“Could this place be inside a great formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed.</p><p>“Hu, we’re safe. We can’t sense that Supreme martial artist anymore!”</p><p>Dandan patted her chest with her claws and let out a long breath.</p><p>The bodies of the nine Dragons shrank. Lu Ming and Long Chen transformed into human forms.</p><p>“The Supreme martial artist didn’t chase us. Let’s recover first!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming descended.</p><p>The area was still in ruins. Below them was the wreckage of an ancient Hall. Lu Ming landed and sat cross-legged on a huge rock. With a wave of his hand, a large pile of raw gemstones appeared. He devoured them and began to refine them.</p><p>After the battle just now, his primeval essence was severely depleted and he needed to recover.</p><p>Long Chen did the same. He took out a pile of raw gemstones and began to recover.</p><p>Half an hour later, their true Yuan recovered to its peak.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The cold wind howled, the only sound in this silent land.</p><p>The blood-colored mist seemed to have become thicker.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we have to leave this place as soon as possible. I feel that this place is very strange. It’s very dangerous if we stay here for too long!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes rolled as she said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. His glabella glowed and Xie nianqing’s figure appeared.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes swept across the room and he was slightly stunned.</p><p>Little Qing, this is the core of the divine Ruins …</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the matter in a few sentences.</p><p>Then, they chose the direction they came from and walked in that direction. However, after walking for a while, they realized that they couldn’t get out at all. It was as if they didn’t come from this direction at all.</p><p>“Is it really a great formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>no, it’s more advanced than a large array. There’s an unknown force that has changed the energy of the field, making it impossible to tell the direction in this place. Right now, we may look like we’re going out, but there’s a possibility that we’re going in!</p><p>Dandan frowned and analyzed.</p><p>“Dandan, you can’t see the flaws and find the way out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“If I was at my peak, this would be nothing. But now, I can only try my best.”</p><p>Dandan smiled awkwardly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a huge bluestone not far away from Lu Ming suddenly emitted a bright light.</p><p>The endless runes glowed and formed chains that were filled with flames.</p><p>Within the light was long Chen.</p><p>The moment he stepped onto the bluestone, the bluestone immediately burst out with chains of flames.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
