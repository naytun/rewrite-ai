Martial techniques of intent that were unheard of in the divine wilderness continent could be inherited here.</p><p>...</p><p>Perhaps the four great divine palaces all had the inheritance of martial arts techniques of creation. Most of the strongest geniuses of the four great divine palaces had come into contact with them and cultivated for many years. Their power must be extraordinary.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the Ice Dragon must have cultivated the ice concept martial arts technique to the second level.</p><p>I didn’t expect seven days to pass so quickly. It’s time to go out. I wonder how little Qing is doing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried.</p><p>He had unknowingly fallen into his previous state of enlightenment. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have chosen this time to attain enlightenment. He would have definitely found Xie nianqing first.</p><p>This place was too dangerous. All the elites were killing each other to take each other’s keys and opportunities. Even with Xie nianqing’s cultivation and combat strength, he was still in danger.</p><p>Without further hesitation, Lu Ming walked out.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>When Lu Ming came to the door, the door opened automatically and he stepped out.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, the door closed automatically.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blood-red key flew out of the nine keyholes on the stone tablet and floated above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s sword. The other eight swords had disappeared.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a few figures flew out from the mountains below.</p><p>“Someone has indeed entered the palace.”</p><p>“Stop him, don’t let him go!”</p><p>so it’s him. I recognize him. He’s from the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>A series of voices rang out. Lu Ming recognized one of them. It was the number one heaven’s favorite of the Shen ‘e continent, e Kuang.</p><p>After this period of time, e Kuang’s cultivation had also broken through the bottleneck and entered the sixth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>A total of three people surrounded Lu Ming from three directions.</p><p>When they came here some time ago, they found nine keyholes on the stone tablet in front of the gate. They had the keys and knew that someone had gone in. The few of them waited in the mountains below and saw Lu Ming coming out.</p><p>this person can’t be underestimated. His combat strength isn’t weak!</p><p>E Kuang’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? With the three of us joining hands, do we still need to fear him …”</p><p>Another youth said.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death! Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>A young man shouted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch. The man’s body was torn to pieces.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged at e Kuang and the other man.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>E Kuang roared in fear.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With two loud bangs, there were two more corpses on the scene. Three keys appeared above Lu Ming’s head, and there were four keys again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and flew in one direction at top speed. At the same time, he spread out his spiritual sense to search for Xie nianqing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was like a bolt of lightning, extremely fast.</p><p>In a short while, they had flown more than a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming saw more than ten halls in the sky.</p><p>There were indeed many palaces in this world.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming looked in front of him. There was a blood-red pillar of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>It was obvious that someone had obtained more than six keys, which was why the blood-red light pillar was activated.</p><p>“I don’t know if little Qing is there, let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He took a step forward and flew in that direction.</p><p>After flying for a while, Lu Ming saw that there were other paragons flying in that direction from other directions. Clearly, the others had also seen the light pillar.</p><p>someone has obtained more than six keys. Kill them!</p><p>“Quick, don’t let others get there first!”</p><p>A series of voices rang out. Lu Ming took a casual glance and saw no less than ten young men flying towards the blood-red light pillar.</p><p>“Lion City!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Among these people, he saw Shi du.</p><p>Shi DU’s aura was at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. It was obvious that he had also broken through to the first level during this period of time.</p><p>In front of them, on the peak of a mountain, everyone saw a young man in blue robes. Above his head, there were seven blood-red keys.</p><p>“It’s him! This is the person!”</p><p>he’s only at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. This person is mine!</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>As soon as they sensed the young man’s cultivation, many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This time, nearly a thousand young geniuses had entered. The ones with the weakest cultivation were even at the second and third level of the spiritual God Realm. This person was at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. If he was lucky, he would really obtain Seven Keys. Their eyes were naturally burning with desire.</p><p>If they could kill this person and obtain his Seven Keys, they would be able to easily obtain the nine keys and enter the palace in the sky to obtain the Fortune.</p><p>The blue-robed youth’s expression changed drastically when he saw so many people. He turned around and fled.</p><p>“Where should we go?”</p><p>“It’s too late to escape!”</p><p>A series of cold shouts rang out, and more than a dozen figures chased after the blue-robed young man.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He could vaguely sense that something was not right. However, he was not afraid and chased after them from a distance.</p><p>A moment later, the young man in blue escaped into a Valley.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>whoosh, whoosh, whoosh …</p><p>Seven to eight young men in blue suddenly flew out of the valley. Each of them had a powerful aura and a cold gaze.</p><p>Many of them had five or four blood-colored keys floating above their heads.</p><p>“Haha, so many big fish!”</p><p>“I’m rich!”</p><p>These people laughed loudly.</p><p>“Not good, we’ve been tricked!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The faces of those young men who were originally chasing changed greatly. They knew that they had fallen into a trap.</p><p>The peak fourth level spiritual God Realm youth in blue was only bait. He had deliberately obtained the Seven Keys to lure others to kill him, and then be led into his trap.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>A few blue-shirted youths sneered. Their bodies revealed a powerful aura. Two of them had even reached the terrifying level of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>They were very fast. They stepped into the air and surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>seventh level spiritual God Realm. It’s over. We’re dead!</p><p>Some people were terrified.</p><p>The lion City was in the same state. It was terrified and wanted to escape, but it was surrounded by the young man in blue from all directions.</p><p>“Ah? Lu Ming!”</p><p>Shi du turned around and saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, his attention had been on the young man in blue and he did not see Lu Ming. Now, he finally saw him.</p><p>A look of shock flashed in his eyes. Seven days ago, he saw with his own eyes that Lu Ming was surrounded by Silver Wings and brutal wind. He thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. He did not expect that Lu Ming was still alive and well.</p><p>However, there was no time to be surprised. Escaping was more important.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The seven young men in blue attacked, and sword light burst out.</p><p>???!</p><p>Instantly, a series of screams rang out as five young men were killed in an instant.</p><p>The remaining few tried their best to resist and finally managed to block the attack.</p><p>Shi du quivered a little, and he dodged a move.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his palm and destroyed one of the sword Qi.</p><p>“Kill! Kill!”</p><p>kill! two cold shouts rang out. The two seventh level spiritual God Realm blue-robed young men made their moves. The sword light was like lightning, instantly killing another two young men.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
