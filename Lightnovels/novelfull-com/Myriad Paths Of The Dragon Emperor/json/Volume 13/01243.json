He was a little shocked.</p><p>The power of thunder and lightning around this Hill was at least dozens of times, even hundreds of times more than that of other places.</p><p>A small hill actually had such a shocking amount of lightning power. It was truly too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully and finally found the reason.</p><p>There was a small tree on the hill. It was about half a meter tall and had three leaves. However, the three leaves looked exactly like the Phoenix in the legends.</p><p>They were like three small phoenixes hanging on the branches, looking very lifelike.</p><p>In the sky above the small tree, a Phoenix made of lightning was dancing. It flew around the small tree and let out crisp cries.</p><p>The incomparably dense power of lightning in the surroundings was all because of this small tree.</p><p>“What a wondrous spiritual tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If he could use this small tree to cultivate, the cultivation speed of the Thundergod strike would definitely increase dramatically. It was indeed a Supreme treasure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The lightning cauldron on top of Lu Ming’s head shook continuously as if it was extremely excited.</p><p>“This is the Spirit Tree. Now, I can go, right?”</p><p>The one-eyed man looked at Lu Ming carefully.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually.</p><p>It didn’t matter whether he killed this one-eyed man or not.</p><p>The one-eyed man was overjoyed and quickly retreated. At the same time, his eyes looked around, as if he was waiting for something.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, not far from the small hill, a terrifying aura burst out. A figure rushed up and appeared not far from Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>There was actually a Supreme martial artist hiding near this small hill.</p><p>it’s dark lightning Supreme! Haha! This brat is dead for sure. How dare he injure me!</p><p>The one-eyed man’s eyes brightened. He laughed in his heart, and a ferocious look flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He had known that there was a Supreme martial artist here and had brought Lu Ming here on purpose. He was sure that the Supreme martial artist would attack Lu Ming’s lightning cauldron.</p><p>As expected, a Supreme martial artist had appeared.</p><p>It was a black-robed old man with a terrifying aura that was as deep as the ocean. He was staring at the lightning cauldron above Lu Ming’s head with a burning gaze.</p><p>haha, with this lightning cauldron, I will definitely be able to enter and obtain the Thunder Phoenix Tree!</p><p>hahaha! the black-robed elder laughed and said, ” kid, I’m dark lightning Supreme. Hand over your lightning cauldron.</p><p>“He wants the lightning cauldron again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>However, this was the world of martial arts where the strong were respected. It was normal for the strong to snatch the treasures of the weak when they were out adventuring. Lu Ming was not too surprised.</p><p>However, did the other party really think that he was stronger than him?</p><p>that person and the others said the same thing to you before, but now, they’re all dead!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the one-eyed man in the distance.</p><p>“Oh? How many great circle spiritual gods can you kill? It seems like he’s a heaven’s favorite. However, do you think that a great circle spiritual God can compare to a Supreme?”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder’s eyes flickered slightly, and then he sneered again.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming could kill a few perfected spiritual gods?</p><p>How could a great circle spiritual God be compared to a Supreme?</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming licked his lips and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>So what if he was a Supreme martial artist? Lu Ming wanted to test his abilities and see if he could fight against a Supreme-being.</p><p>“Brat, if you still want to fight with this old man, then this old man will fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Sensing Lu Ming’s fighting spirit, Dark Thunder Supreme’s face darkened, and the aura on his body became even more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying force suddenly pressed down on Lu Ming’s body, causing him to tremble slightly.</p><p>“Burst!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and the nine streams of dragon energy burst forth. At the same time, his vital essence circulated wildly. The five concepts of heaven and earth also burst forth completely, forming a battle suit that covered his entire body.</p><p>“Dark Thunder hand!”</p><p>Endless black Lightning emanated from Dark Thunder Supreme’s body. He stretched out his hand, forming a huge black Lightning palm that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Black Lightning flashed and was filled with destructive power. Within the destructive power, there was also a sense of corrosion.</p><p>The black Lightning was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The third bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head. A surge of energy surged into his body, turning his hair blood red.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>An incomparably strong killing intent rushed out. Lu Ming took a step forward and activated the destructive prison heaven technique. He threw a punch and it landed on the black Lightning palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion rang out. At the point where the fist and the black palm met, a black hole appeared at first, then suddenly exploded, and a terrifying energy scattered in all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he took three steps back. However, the black Lightning palm was also shattered by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>“The battle prowess of a Supreme martial artist is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his fist was slightly numb. There were even thin black Lightning bolts flashing. They tried their best to drill into Lu Ming’s fist but were blocked by him.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, but he did not know that Dark Thunder Supreme was even more shocked.</p><p>“He actually blocked it!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder’s heart jolted in disbelief.</p><p>He had never heard of a mere seventh level spiritual God blocking his attack.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can take from this old man!”</p><p>Dark Thunder venerable’s killing intent bloomed, and he struck out with his palm again.</p><p>The power of this palm was stronger than the previous one, and it was even more shocking.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>With a Dragon’s Roar, the nine Dragons ‘bloodline appeared. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons and stepped out with his dragon claws, crushing the black palm print again.</p><p>“Dammit, kill! Dark lightning domain!”</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme’s killing intent grew even more intense. He turned his palm into a fist and punched.</p><p>In this punch, another black domain bloomed and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is the embryonic form of a domain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He could sense a dangerous aura.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the prison suppressing heaven technique to its maximum. At the same time, the devouring power burst forth. The five-colored concept circulated and the strongest power burst forth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them clashed again.</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘bodies trembled violently, and their dragon claws stepped in the air as they retreated.</p><p>However, Dark Thunder Supreme had retreated as well. Moreover, the distance he retreated was not shorter than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“This … How is this possible?”</p><p>In the distance, the one-eyed man was still watching the battle. At this time, his only eye almost burst, and his mouth was wide open with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>Lu Ming, a young man who was not even thirty years old, was actually able to fight a Supreme-being with his cultivation at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. Furthermore, he was able to force a Supreme-being to retreat. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>How could there be such a powerful Young heaven’s favorite in the world?</p><p>Could he be the strongest heaven’s favorite of the four great divine palaces?</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Dark Thunder Supreme roared and was truly enraged. He had been famous for thousands of years, but he was actually forced to retreat by a seventh level spiritual God Realm brat. If word of this got out, he wouldn’t be able to live anymore.</p><p>He activated the embryonic form of the domain and continued to launch a storm-like attack on Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
