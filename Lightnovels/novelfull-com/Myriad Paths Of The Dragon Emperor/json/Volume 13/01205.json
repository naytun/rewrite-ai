Next, others went up and took out their treasures to exchange.</p><p>...</p><p>I also have two Divine Ruins ancient mines here. I wonder who needs it? I’ll buy it with raw stones!</p><p>After a while, another young man went up and took out two pieces of glistening yellow Divine Ruins ancient mine.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>When the young man took out the two ancient mines of the divine Ruins, Xie nianqing raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I feel that there’s something in one of the old mines!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little Qing, you can sense it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s indeed something in one of the old mines. It’s quite suitable for this chick. That’s why she sensed it. However, it’s not too precious!”</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and planned to buy it.</p><p>Just like before, buying the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine was like gambling, and almost no one made a bid.</p><p>I’m new here, and I’m very curious about the divine Ruins ‘ancient mines. These two ancient mines, I’ll offer 100 thousand pieces of raw stones to buy them and study them!</p><p>Lu Ming said casually. He seemed to have bought two pieces purely out of curiosity.</p><p>After Lu Ming spoke, no one else spoke.</p><p>That young man was somewhat depressed. Those three pieces of Divine Ruins ancient mine previously were raised to a high price of five million, while his two pieces could only be sold for a hundred thousand?</p><p>After waiting for a while and seeing that no one else was bidding, he could only sell Lu Ming at a price of one hundred thousand.</p><p>Lu Ming handed the rough stone to the young man and kept the two pieces of the old mine. He did not go down.</p><p>Instead, he swept his gaze across the entire place and said,”Lu Ming would like to purchase the emperor’s Bloodstone, nine-leaf Ganoderma, Goblin, and octagonal mysterious ice grass. If you have these four spiritual herbs, you can state your conditions. Lu Ming will try his best to fulfill them!”</p><p>“Emperor’s Blood Stone, earth Emperor’s essence …”</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>these four items are all very precious. Their value is no less than the fire spirit root. In fact, the octagonal mysterious ice grass is even more expensive!</p><p>that’s right. I’ve only heard of these four spiritual herbs and materials, but I’ve never seen them before!</p><p>The others were all discussing, and almost everyone shook their heads, indicating that there was no such thing.</p><p>“Emperor’s Blood Stone, I do have one!”</p><p>Right at this moment, a clear and melodious voice sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>The one who spoke was the stunning woman in the fiery red dress.</p><p>“It’s Ji hongchen!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This woman was indeed Ji hongchen.</p><p>He was one of the three strongest heaven’s favorites of the younger generation in the South God Palace. Ye Chuan had mentioned him before.</p><p>“Miss Ji, you have the emperor’s Bloodstone?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Ji Hong Chen’s palm glowed and a dark red stone appeared. This stone was like blood jade. The strange thing was that there was a sweet fragrance coming from the stone. It was very pleasant to smell.</p><p>“It really is the emperor’s Bloodstone!” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Miss Ji, what treasure do you need to exchange for the emperor’s Blood Stone? see if I have it on me. If I don’t, I’ll find a way to get it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>brother Lu, it’s your first time in the divine Ruins. You’re a guest, so I don’t need to exchange for any treasures. Brother Lu can just buy it with raw stones. En, 30 million raw stones it is then!</p><p>Ji hongchen said.</p><p>“Thirty million?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>It was not because it was too expensive, but because it was too cheap.</p><p>A rare treasure like the Emperor Bloodstone was at the peak of level nine and was extremely rare. Its true price was definitely not just thirty million.</p><p>“Miss Ji, I’ve already gotten a huge bargain with thirty million raw stones.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you are a guest. I’ll take it as hongchen befriending you.”</p><p>Ji hongchen laughed in a forthright manner.</p><p>Everyone was clear that Ji hongchen’s attitude was due to Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s combat strength was low, Ji hongchen would not have bothered with him. But now, Lu Ming’s strength had attracted Ji hongchen’s attention. That was why he wanted to befriend him.</p><p>“Then thank you, miss Ji!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not a bashful person. He took out a storage ring, stored thirty million raw stones in it, and handed it to Ji hongchen.</p><p>Ji hongchen handed the emperor’s Blood Stone to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the emperor’s Bloodstone and returned to his seat. He was in a good mood.</p><p>Today’s harvest was not bad.</p><p>After that, more people took out their treasures to exchange, but Xie nianqing and Lu Ming were not interested.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood up and left. They went to the fifth floor and said goodbye to ye Chuan. They left the treasure Exchange Tower and returned to their residence on general peak.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing entered the mountain and river diagram and sat cross-legged on a mountain peak.</p><p>Between the two people, a piece of Divine Ruins ancient mine was suspended.</p><p>This piece was the one that Xie nianqing had sensed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s vital essence on his finger condensed into a blade of vital essence and he cut it down at the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>The divine Ruins ‘ancient mine was very hard, even harder than many metals. However, under Lu Ming’s blade of quintessential essence, it was still easily cut open.</p><p>Instantly, a wisp of black demonic Qi filled the air.</p><p>“There’s really something!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. This Divine Ruins ‘ancient mine was really intriguing. There was something sealed in the ancient mine.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>In the end, the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine split open, and a drop of dark red blood appeared. A beam of dense demonic light shot up into the sky.</p><p>this is a powerhouse’s fresh blood, sealed inside the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly surprised.</p><p>Legend had it that ores like the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine did not come from the divine Ruins continent. Some people guessed that it came from beyond the heavens. When experts fought, treasures, fresh blood, essence blood, and other things splashed onto the divine Ruins’ ore, they landed on the divine Ruins continent through the spatial cracks. For various reasons, some treasures, fresh blood, and other things were sealed by the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, and after a long time, they were preserved.</p><p>the owner of this drop of blood is an expert who cultivates the demonic path. Although many years have passed and this drop of blood no longer has much power, it is still very useful to me. If I refine it, my cultivation will definitely increase!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“En, little Qing, then quickly refine it, before the energy dissipates!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. The blood vessels appeared on his head. He formed a seal with his hands and sucked a drop of blood into his hands. He began to refine it.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that Xie nianqing would need at least a few days to refine a drop of demon blood. Lu Ming went to a nearby mountain peak and took out the remaining few ancient mines in the divine Ruins.</p><p>Three of them were bought by mu Jue, but his storage ring was taken by Lu Ming. The three Divine Ruins ancient mines naturally fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>One of them was the one that he sensed a treasure in. Lu Ming put it aside first and cut open the other three Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines one by one.</p><p>As expected, there was nothing inside. There were only three ores that were useless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the last piece of old mine. He used the blade of quintessential essence and cut it.</p><p>Immediately, a scorching aura spread out from the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy and completely cut open the old mine.</p><p>“This is … A weapon fragment!”</p><p>In the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, Lu Ming discovered a piece of weapon fragment that emitted a scorching aura, as if there was a flame burning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
