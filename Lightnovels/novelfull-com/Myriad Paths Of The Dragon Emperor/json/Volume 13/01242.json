Boy, give this lightning cauldron to this old man and you can get lost!”</p><p>...</p><p>The Azure-robed elder said coolly.</p><p>His body emitted a powerful aura. It was the aura of a great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It turned out that the other party had his eyes on his lightning cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. A mere perfect stage spiritual God. Lu Ming did not care about him at all. Since the other party was seeking death, he did not mind sending him on his way.</p><p>“Brat, didn’t you hear me talking to you? Hand over the lightning cauldron and get lost. Otherwise, you won’t be able to leave when this old man makes his move!”</p><p>The Azure-robed elder berated.</p><p>“You can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>you don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. You’re only at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. Do you think you can compete with me? Since you’re so stubborn, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>The green-robed elder’s expression turned cold, and his body began to exude a cold killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, a few more powerful auras rose up from that large mountain.</p><p>A total of three people flew out from the mountain and appeared around Lu Ming, surrounding him.</p><p>All of them were at the great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>“Old monster Qing, how can you keep such a treasure for yourself?”</p><p>A one-eyed man shouted.</p><p>“Everyone, this old master discovered this first!”</p><p>The Azure-robed old man’s expression became even gloomier when he saw the one-eyed man’s group of three.</p><p>“You discovered it first? What a joke, I was only cultivating just now, but my spiritual sense had already discovered it!”</p><p>The one-eyed man sarcastically said.</p><p>The other two also said that they had already noticed it.</p><p>The four of them completely ignored Lu Ming and actually started to fight over it.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. He did not pose any threat.</p><p>“Are you done with your nonsense?”</p><p>Just as the four of them were fighting and confronting each other, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>The four of them quieted down immediately and looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>“Enough nonsense, then I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a murderous aura.</p><p>“What? What did this kid just say? Hahaha!”</p><p>The one-eyed man laughed.</p><p>Under such circumstances, surrounded by four perfected spiritual God experts, Lu Ming actually said that he would send them on their way. Was this kid crazy?</p><p>“Brat, I’ll send you on your way first!”</p><p>Killing intent flashed in the one-eyed man’s only eye. At the same time, a battleaxe appeared in his hand. The power of thunder and lightning bloomed all over his body as he swung the battleaxe at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a single thought, the lightning cauldron above his head trembled. Then, a bolt of lightning as thick as a water tank burst out and struck the one-eyed man.</p><p>With a sizzling sound, the one-eyed man was drowned by the lightning. The power of the lightning emitted from his body was like a mouse meeting a cat under the lightning of the lightning cauldron. It instantly vanished.</p><p>The one-eyed man wailed as his protective Zhen Yuan was also shattered by the lightning. His skin and flesh were split open, and smoke rose from his body.</p><p>“What a powerful force, what a powerful treasure!”</p><p>The green-robed elder exclaimed. At the same time, the blazing light in his eyes became even more brilliant.</p><p>this treasure is extremely powerful. Why don’t we join forces and seize the treasure first? then, we can discuss how to divide it!</p><p>The green-robed elder said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>The other two agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>The power of the lightning cauldron’s attack had shocked them, but at the same time, it also made them even more excited.</p><p>In an instant, the three of them attacked. Three terrifying attacks fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>With the three of them working together, even a perfected spiritual God would be severely injured or even killed, let alone an existence at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body, and nine streams of dragon energy burst out instantly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and destroyed the attack of one of the gray-robed elders. His palm did not stop and continued to slash at the gray-robed elder’s body.</p><p>The grey-robed old man let out a blood-curdling screech as his body caved in. His body was sent flying like a cannonball as he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>A great circle spiritual God expert was severely injured in one move.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>From the lightning cauldron, a huge lightning bolt flew out and drowned the grey-robed old man. He wailed in pain. When the lightning bolt disappeared, the grey-robed old man’s body was already charred black, without any signs of life.</p><p>An expert at the great circle of the spiritual God stage was killed by Lu Ming in two moves.</p><p>At the same time, the attacks of the two elders landed on Lu Ming’s body. However, Lu Ming’s muscles tensed up and he used the prison suppressing heaven technique, easily nullifying their attacks.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Their eyes widened in disbelief, and then they were shocked.</p><p>A perfected spiritual God was killed by Lu Ming in just a few moves. This was too terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. After killing the gray-robed elder, he went after another person.</p><p>That person frantically tried to block, but under Lu Ming’s attack, everything seemed so fragile. Lu Ming’s palm pierced through his heart, and the spiritual God did not manage to escape. It was struck into nothingness.</p><p>“Ah, what a freak!”</p><p>” ah! the Azure-robed elder was so frightened that he screamed and screamed as he frantically fled.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took a step forward. He appeared above the elder’s head and stomped down continuously. The elder’s body exploded under the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>Three perfected spiritual God powerhouses were killed by Lu Ming in a few breaths.</p><p>There were still a few people on that mountain, but their cultivation had not reached the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. When they saw the four great circle spiritual gods attack, they knew that they had no fate with the treasure. Therefore, they did not attack and sighed inwardly.</p><p>At this moment, all of them were so scared that their faces turned pale. They felt a chill in their hearts as they tried their best to restrain their aura and hide in the mountains.</p><p>Now, they were glad that they didn’t go out. Otherwise, they would be dead.</p><p>he’s a monster! He’s a god of death!</p><p>They thought in fear.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. It opened its mouth and swallowed all the blood essence energy of the few people. Then, it took a step forward and chased after one person.</p><p>That person was none other than the one-eyed man. He had been struck by the lightning cauldron in the beginning, but he was only severely injured and not dead. When he saw Lu Ming display his divine might and kill a perfected spiritual God expert as if he was chopping vegetables, he had long been scared out of his wits and was running for his life. When he saw Lu Ming, he shrieked in fear,”Spare me, young hero, spare me! I know there’s a peerless treasure here!”</p><p>“A peerless treasure?”</p><p>With a flash of light, Lu Ming appeared in front of the one-eyed man, deep in thought.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not kill him and seemed to be moved, the one-eyed man was overjoyed and shouted, ” there’s a treasure there that’s nurtured by the power of Thunder. It’s very useful for cultivating the power of Thunder or martial techniques. As long as you promise not to kill me, I’ll Take You There!</p><p>The one-eyed man looked at Lu Ming with hope. He felt uneasy, afraid that Lu Ming would kill him.</p><p>“If that treasure can satisfy me, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Alright, alright. I’ll Take You There now. You’ll definitely be satisfied.</p><p>The one-eyed man nodded again and again, grasping at the last life-saving straw.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
