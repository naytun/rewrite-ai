Naturally, they missed each other and snuggled up to each other, chatting.</p><p>...</p><p>Half a day later, a voice was heard in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you will be teleported back to your original place in half a month!”</p><p>This was Earth one’s voice.</p><p>“In half a month?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Initially, he wanted to cultivate here for a longer period of time. It was because a few years of cultivation here would only be a short time in the outside world. It would be a pity to miss such a good place.</p><p>But now, Earth One had transmitted a message that there was only half a month left.</p><p>Lu Ming told Xie nianqing about this and exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Earth one’s figure was nowhere to be seen in the huge stone chamber. Earth One must have sensed something and sent him a voice transmission.</p><p>“Senior Earth One, why is it only half a month?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard. He knew that Earth One should be able to hear him.</p><p>the time here is accelerated extremely fast, but to maintain the time acceleration, it requires a huge amount of energy. Every time, only when the qualified participants come here will the time acceleration be activated. Now, you have successfully cultivated the chaos will, so the time acceleration here naturally has to stop. Otherwise, there won’t be so much energy consumption!</p><p>Earth one’s voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Although he felt that it was a pity, it was normal.</p><p>Time acceleration was too heaven-defying, so it naturally couldn’t be maintained indefinitely. It required a terrifying amount of energy.</p><p>If it could be easily maintained, then it would be too terrifying. Cultivating in there for thousands of years was only equivalent to how much time had passed in the outside world. If they let a group of people in to cultivate, wouldn’t that be heaven-defying?</p><p>That was impossible.</p><p>Even with the primal Chaos Palace’s Foundation, they wouldn’t be able to maintain it for long.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll leave in half a month!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Earth one’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Next, I’ll increase my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Now, his intent had already transformed into chaos intent and was at the full circle of level four.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level could also be raised to the perfected spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Half a month’s time was enough for Lu Ming to devour and refine the rough stone to improve his cultivation.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a large pile of raw gemstones appeared. The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. With one gulp, ten million raw gemstones were devoured and refined.</p><p>A huge number of raw gemstones were being refined and converted into essential core, helping Lu Ming to break through to the next realm.</p><p>After refining ten million, he swallowed another ten million.</p><p>Ten million and ten million.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. Lu Ming had devoured and refined a total of one hundred million raw gemstones.</p><p>Such an astonishing amount of raw gemstones transformed into an astonishing amount of true essence and began to break through.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura in Lu Ming’s body surged. The spiritual God in his dantian bloomed with multicolored light and became solid and heavy, just like a real person.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had also broken through from the peak of the ninth level spiritual God Realm to the perfected spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Great circle of the spiritual God Realm. Lu Ming had finally cultivated to the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. The next step would be to start breaking through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>Everything was in preparation for the Emperor.</p><p>In the process of breaking through to the Emperor realm, one could comprehend the embryonic form of a domain and become a Supreme.</p><p>The great circle of the spiritual God Realm was already at the peak of the three spiritual God realms.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the extremely rich vital essence in his body. He had a confident smile on his face.</p><p>Now, how strong was his combat strength?</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out and was very curious.</p><p>“Time to go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked towards the door of the stone room. The stone door opened automatically and Lu Ming walked out. Outside, he saw the same fighting ring.</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the others were still on the fighting ring.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming come out, Earth One, gold one, and the rest smiled and suddenly bowed to Lu Ming, calling out in unison, ” “This subordinate greets the young master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He hurriedly helped Earth One and the rest up and said, ” “Seniors, what are you all doing? Please get up!”</p><p>young master, you’ve obtained the inheritance of the chaos Emperor and successfully cultivated the chaos will. You’re our young master!</p><p>Tu Yi spoke and insisted on kowtowing to Lu Ming.</p><p>What was the cultivation base of Earth One and the rest? Lu Ming could not stop them at all. He could only let them bow down to him.</p><p>After paying their respects, Earth One and the rest stood up.</p><p>“Seniors, are you all the only ones left in the primal Chaos Hall?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>sigh, all the experts of the primal Chaos Palace were killed in the battle that year. We are the only puppets left, but there aren’t many of us left!</p><p>Earth One sighed.</p><p>“Then, can you all come out with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>The cultivation of Earth One and the others was unfathomable. If they could go out with him, it would be easy to kill Di Yi and even wipe out the continent group of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming was disappointed.</p><p>“We can’t!”</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the rest shook their heads.</p><p>young master, the venerable sovereign left behind his last words. We can only leave if the inheritor of the venerable sovereign has reached the Saint realm. Before that, we can’t leave and can’t help you much!</p><p>Tu Yi explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly disappointed. It seemed that the chaos Thearch was afraid that his inheritor would rely too much on the power of tu Yi and the others and lose the will to improve. Thus, he set such a rule.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s look of disappointment, Earth One muttered to himself for a moment and said, ” “Young master, it’s not that there’s no reward at all. Because you performed exceptionally well during the test, you’ll be rewarded.”</p><p>With that said, Earth One waved his hand, and a figure appeared beside him.</p><p>It was a figure that was similar to tu Yi’s, also in a khaki color. One look and one could tell that it was a puppet.</p><p>young master, this puppet’s name is tu Qian. It has the strength of a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert. It can follow you out temporarily and help you!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>That’s fine. A peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert would be the strongest in the divine wilderness continent, comparable to Di Yi.</p><p>“Greetings, young master!”</p><p>Tu Qian bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, tu Qian, you will temporarily enter the treasure!”</p><p>Lu Ming summoned the mountain and river diagram and kept tu Qian in it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a token flew over and suspended above Lu Ming’s head. It was the primordial chaos token.</p><p>young master, you have to keep this primordial chaos token well. In the future, you might be able to compete for the throne of the primordial chaos sect’s successor!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>“Hunyuan sect’s successor?” Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>that’s right. Anyone who obtains a primordial chaos token will have a great opportunity in the future to compete for the position of the successor of the primordial chaos sect and have the chance to inherit the sect. At that time, not only the primal Chaos Hall, but the other eight halls will have to listen to the orders of the successor of the primordial chaos sect.</p><p>Tu Yi explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He did not expect the primordial chaos token to have such a use.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly put away the primordial chaos token.</p><p>“Young master, we’ll send you back!”</p><p>Earth One Dao. Then, he joined hands with gold one and the rest to open a void channel. Lu Ming felt his body tighten and his vision turned black. He was plunged into darkness.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, there was a bright light. At the same time, Lu Ming heard a loud voice. It was dandan’s voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
