The eastern deity Palace was slightly stronger than the southern and Western deity palaces, and the strongest was undoubtedly the northern deity Palace.</p><p>That was because the second-ranked continent in the divine Ruins ‘continent cluster was in the North.</p><p>In the direction of the North divine Palace, a group of proud sovereigns stood upright. Powerful auras emanated from their bodies. There were nearly three hundred of them.</p><p>At this moment, sharp gazes pierced through the void around the thirty-six peaks. They were like sharp swords, clashing in the void and sizing each other up.</p><p>The strongest heaven’s favorites from the continent of the divine Ruins were gathered there. There were nearly 1000 of them.</p><p>Nearly 1,000 heaven’s favorites. What a huge number. All of them were experts who had awakened ninth level divine bloodline.</p><p>Each one of them was a proud son of the heavens and had great luck.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent’s Lion Capital, Kong Lin, yang potian, Ming Zi, and the rest had extremely grave and ugly expressions. In the depths of their eyes, there was a look of shock.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, they were undoubtedly existences that stood at the peak. All of them were destined to step into the Emperor realm, receiving worldwide attention and being invincible among those of the same level.</p><p>All of them were extremely proud. They believed that even if they left the divine wilderness continent, they would not be weak. They would be the cream of the crop.</p><p>But at this moment, their confidence was shaken.</p><p>This was because every single one of the 1000 heaven’s favorites here was as talented as them. In fact, they were even more talented.</p><p>“There are so many chosen here. This is what makes it interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He could feel the blood in his body boiling and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>On the side, Long Chen was the same, full of fighting spirit.</p><p>They stood at the peak of the divine wilderness continent. They were unrivaled and almost unrivaled. But now, there were so many opponents. This made their blood boil once again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, more than a dozen figures moved. In a flash, they flew toward the 36 mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming saw three people from the South God Palace.</p><p>They were Ji hongchen, Wang Zhen, and the purple-haired youth.</p><p>The Western deity Palace also had three people, while the eastern and Northern deity palaces had four people each.</p><p>There were 14 of them, and they were the strongest 14 geniuses of the four great divine palaces. Their names had long shaken the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>The fourteen of them landed on the peak of a mountain, looking down on the other heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Only the strongest heaven’s chosen could enter the 36 Tiangang peaks. It was a symbol of one’s status.</p><p>The fourteen unparalleled geniuses from the four great divine palaces clearly had the qualifications.</p><p>Looking at the 14 heaven’s favorites, many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, one figure after another flew up to the remaining mountains.</p><p>Of the remaining twenty-two peaks, more than twenty-two people had leaped onto them. Naturally, there were some peaks where more than one person had leaped onto.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost. What qualifications do you have to occupy this mountain?”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a fierce battle broke out.</p><p>Those who wanted to climb up the mountain were all very powerful heaven’s favorites. They had enough confidence in themselves. Otherwise, they wouldn’t dare to go up.</p><p>Most of them were the strongest heaven’s favorites from the top ten continents in the divine Ruins.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky was rumbling, and the battle was extremely intense. All kinds of lights flickered, and it was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Oh my God, are these the strongest heaven’s favorites of the divine Ruins? It’s too shocking!”</p><p>“Such combat strength is comparable to a great circle spiritual God, right? Even an ordinary great circle spiritual God isn’t this terrifying!”</p><p>Many people were discussing and were shocked.</p><p>As for Dark Child, Lion Capital, and the others, their eyes were filled with horror. These people were too strong, far stronger than them.</p><p>seventh level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The youths fighting were all at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, and their combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>In the end, the winner was still decided. Someone was sent flying back while spitting blood. Then, a youth stood on each of the 36 Phecda peaks.</p><p>However, the fight was obviously not over yet.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>“This is not a place you can stand!”</p><p>From four directions, more young experts flew up, each of them choosing their target and launching a fierce attack.</p><p>On the South God Palace’s side, other than Ji hongchen’s group of three, there were three other people from the White Feather continent, one from the ping Dong continent, and another young man from another continent.</p><p>This continent was called the flame billow continent. This young man was wearing a long robe with a flame pattern. He was the number one genius of the flame billow continent.</p><p>At that moment, a short-haired young man flew out and attacked the geniuses of the yanlan continent.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The short-haired young man who was evenly matched with the yanlan continent shouted coldly. His Iron Fist was like a mountain as he attacked the yanlan continent’s heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The eyes of the Yan LAN continent’s heaven’s favorites turned cold. The flames on their bodies soared into the sky as they fought with the short-haired young man.</p><p>Both of them were at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. The two of them fought fiercely and exchanged dozens of moves. In the end, the short-haired young man, who was evenly matched with the continent, had a stronger cultivation and sent the genius of the yanlan continent flying.</p><p>the ping Yang continent is indeed the eighth-ranked continent. This person is called Lu Chengzhou. He is the second-ranked genius of the ping Yang continent, but his strength is still so shocking!</p><p>the top ten continents are indeed amazing. There are so many experts that the other continents can’t compare!</p><p>Around Lu Ming and the others, the paragons of some small continents were discussing. Their words were filled with respect and sighs.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites who stood at the peak of their respective continents. However, compared to these heaven’s favorites, there was a huge gap.</p><p>However, many people clenched their fists again.</p><p>They were confident that their talent would not be worse than others. It was just that their resources were not as good as those of the top-ranked continents, which was why their cultivation levels were lagging behind. As long as they were given time, they were confident that they would be able to catch up.</p><p>Lu Chengzhou stood on the peak of a mountain and looked down at his surroundings. When his gaze fell on Lu Ming, his eyes were very cold.</p><p>“You, get down too!”</p><p>Unfortunately, before Lu Chengzhou could even stand there for a minute, a sovereign from the eastern God Palace rushed out and charged toward Lu Chengzhou.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely, but after a dozen moves, Lu Chengzhou was sent flying far away, spitting out blood.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lu Chengzhou let out a roar and revealed a look of unwillingness. However, his eyes were filled with terror.</p><p>The sovereign of the eastern God Palace had defeated him in a dozen moves. He was too strong.</p><p>The fierce battle and competition continued. However, none of the 14 strongest heaven’s favorites from the four divine palaces, as well as the heaven’s favorites from the second, third, and fourth-ranked continents, dared to challenge them.</p><p>This was because these people gave off a feeling of danger.</p><p>The fight went on for more than ten minutes before it stopped.</p><p>There was a heaven’s favorite standing on each of the 36 peaks of the Big Dipper.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
