They had no idea how long they had been walking, but they still hadn’t gotten out. The blood mist around them was getting thicker and thicker.</p><p>“Dandan, can we get out or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Cough, cough! Don’t be impatient, you have to believe me!”</p><p>Dandan coughed a few times and said.</p><p>Hearing dandan’s dry coughs, Lu Ming felt even more uncertain. This fellow’s dry coughs were definitely not good news.</p><p>As expected, they continued to move forward but there were no signs of them leaving. Instead, there were more and more broken formations around them. Lu Ming judged that they were getting stronger and stronger, so they had to be more careful.</p><p>there’s a Palace up ahead!</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Long Chen looked over, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>A Palace appeared in front of them. It was an intact Palace, black in color, and extremely huge. It was thousands of meters tall, magnificent and full of the traces of time.</p><p>Ever since they entered the divine Ruins, they had not discovered an intact building, let alone an intact Palace. But in front of them, an intact Palace appeared.</p><p>an intact Palace. There must be treasures inside!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“With treasures, it also means more danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the end, after some discussion, they decided to explore.</p><p>Since he was here, it would be a pity not to explore.</p><p>The three people and one turtle carefully approached the huge Palace.</p><p>He could see that there was a huge door in the center of the palace. The door was open, but it was dark inside, and he could not see clearly.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, a series of rumbles came from the palace, as if a huge creature was walking.</p><p>“It seems like something is coming!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes solemn.</p><p>“Let’s retreat first!”</p><p>Dandan swallowed a mouthful of saliva, feeling a little scared in her heart.</p><p>The few of them retreated for a while and then found a huge rock to hide. Dandan carved a formation to conceal their aura for them and then secretly observed.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sound became louder and louder, one after another, very rhythmical, as if there really was a huge creature walking.</p><p>“It’s out. That’s … A Dragon!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed in shock.</p><p>“A Dragon with a Broken Head … Also …”</p><p>Long Chen said. This heaven’s favorite who had been calm and expressionless all this time suddenly changed his expression. His voice was very shocked and hoarse.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>At the gate of the palace, a huge creature finally showed its true form.</p><p>It was a Dragon with five claws under its belly. It was a true dragon, a five-clawed true dragon.</p><p>However, the shocking thing was that this true dragon didn’t have a head. Its head seemed to have been chopped off, and its whole body was covered with black scales, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there was a Knight sitting on the back of the true dragon.</p><p>A Knight in black armor held a Dragon Spear that was several meters long.</p><p>This black-armored knight was like a true dragon, without a head.</p><p>A headless knight, riding a headless true dragon, walked out of the palace, exuding a powerful and terrifying aura.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The headless true dragon actually let out a deafening Dragon’s Roar, causing Lu Ming and the others ‘eardrums to hurt.</p><p>Then, the Headless Horseman, riding on the headless true dragon, was actually walking in their direction.</p><p>The true dragon stomped, and the earth rumbled.</p><p>“Not good, they’ve found us!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>Dandan exclaimed and turned to run.</p><p>But-</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The headless true dragon Riders exuded a terrifying wave of energy. This wave of energy was more powerful than any Emperor that Lu Ming had met. The space around them seemed to have turned into a physical substance. Their bodies were suppressed by the space and they could not move at all. It was as if they were fixed in place.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength but it was of no help. He could not even use his blood Meridian.</p><p>Too powerful, this headless true dragon Rider was too powerful, its battle strength was terrifying.</p><p>“Dandan, you bastard, you’ve really screwed me up this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“I … I don’t know!”</p><p>Dandan maintained her running posture and was fixed in the air, her mouth crooked.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The headless true dragon Rider stepped forward, getting closer and closer to them. Its powerful aura shattered the huge rocks in front of them, and they were directly exposed to the headless rider.</p><p>“Trespassers will be killed!”</p><p>A cold and emotionless voice came from the Headless Horseman.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing. This time, he was most likely doomed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, as long as I’m with you, what’s the harm in dying?”</p><p>Xie nianqing sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, his eyes filled with affection.</p><p>“It can’t be, could it be that this King didn’t die in that earth-shattering battle, but I’m going to die Here? No way, don’t!”</p><p>Dandan shouted, her voice full of unwillingness.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Headless Horseman stood in front of them and pointed the Dragon Spear in his hand. A cold killing intent covered the few people.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The cold voice came from somewhere unknown.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s body glowed. A purple-gold token floated out of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Mixed essence token!</p><p>This was the mixed-essence token that Lu Ming had obtained in the battle of Providence. He did not know how to use it, but it floated in the air of its own accord at this moment.</p><p>At the same time, a purple-gold token also appeared on Long Chen’s body. It was also a mixed-essence token.</p><p>Long Chen had also obtained a mixed-essence token when he participated in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Two mixed essence tokens flew out, emitting a bright light.</p><p>The headless true dragon Knight stopped in his tracks, as if he was looking at the two mixed energy tokens.</p><p>Hunyuan token. You’re Hunyuan sect disciples. It’s been countless years. I didn’t expect to see Hunyuan sect disciples again. Since you’re Hunyuan sect disciples, you’re one of us. Come in!</p><p>A cold and dry voice came out of the headless true dragon Knight’s mouth. The pressure on Lu Ming and the rest was relieved and disappeared without a trace. Lu Ming and the rest immediately regained their freedom.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s little hand and looked at the headless true dragon Knight cautiously.</p><p>“It’s been so many years. I’ve finally met a Hunyuan sect disciple again. How’s Hunyuan sect now? Is it still resisting, or has it already been destroyed?”</p><p>A leisurely voice came from the headless true dragon Rider.</p><p>Then, the headless true dragon Knight turned around and left. Step by step, it walked into the pitch-black Palace and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“You guys can come in. What kind of opportunities you can get will depend on your luck!”</p><p>The voice of the headless true dragon Knight came from the palace, and then it became completely silent.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Long Chen, and the others were all stunned and confused.</p><p>The headless true dragon Knight’s attitude changed drastically when he saw Lu Ming and Long Chen’s primordial chaos tokens. He left immediately and even allowed them to enter the palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
