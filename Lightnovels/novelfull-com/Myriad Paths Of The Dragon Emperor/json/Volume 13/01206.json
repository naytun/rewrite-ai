It contains intense fire power. If I can extract it and refine it, my fire concept will definitely improve greatly!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and was tempted. He then circulated his essential core to wrap the weapon fragment and began to extract it.</p><p>As Lu Ming continued to condense, a flame was extracted from the weapon fragment and jumped on his fingertips.</p><p>“Refine!”</p><p>His quintessential essence wrapped around the flames and began to refine them.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and carefully sensed the fire energy in it to improve his own fire concept.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed.</p><p>After more than ten days, Lu Ming had completely refined the ball of flame.</p><p>fire concept, the peak of level four upper tier!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and a flame flashed past his eyes.</p><p>The peak of level four upper tier was only a step away from the great circle of level four.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>From a nearby mountain peak, demonic might was vast and mighty, and a stream of demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. Little Qing’s cultivation has also improved greatly!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>When he first met Xie nianqing in the abyss demon territory, Xie nianqing had just broken through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm. After receiving Xie Luan’s inheritance and cultivating for a while, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>However, he was only at the early stage of the fourth level spiritual God Realm. Clearly, in the past half a month, Xie nianqing had refined that drop of demon blood and his cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Although the energy from the drop of demonic blood had been refined, Xie nianqing was still cultivating. Lu Ming could feel that the heavenly demon will was stirring in Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>little Qing wants to take this opportunity to break through the heavenly demon will in one go!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He knew Xie nianqing’s plan.</p><p>That drop of demonic blood also contained a strong demonic will. It was very touching for Xie nianqing, so it was normal for him to have a breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming did not disturb Xie nianqing. A piece of sky Thunder wood appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the sky Thunder wood to continue cultivating and comprehend the concept of Thunder.</p><p>It was very similar to the refining of the weapon fragment earlier. Lu Ming first extracted a wisp of lightning from the sky Thunder wood and then refined this wisp of lightning to improve his Thunder concept.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another dozen days had passed.</p><p>In total, Lu Ming had been in closed-door cultivation for a month.</p><p>The wisp of lightning had also been refined by Lu Ming. His lightning concept had also reached the peak of level four upper tier.</p><p>The sky Thunder wood that he had bought with five million orirocks could help his Thunder concept reach the peak of level four upper tier. It was worth it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure stepped through the air and appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’ve broken through your intent realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>yes, my heavenly demon will has reached the peak of level four upper tier. It’s a pity that I’m only one step away from reaching the full circle of level four!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>This time, she had gained a lot. Her cultivation was just one step away from breaking through to the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>That Divine Ruins ancient mine is truly wondrous. I reckon that there must be Supreme powerhouses who cultivated The Fiend path being killed, their flesh and blood scattered. Some were sealed inside the divine Ruins ancient mine!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was also very curious about the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine.</p><p>Wuwuwu …</p><p>At this moment, a cry sounded in the sky.</p><p>The cry sounded very sorrowful, very sorrowful.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>This cry definitely did not come from within the mountain and river diagram, but from the outside world.</p><p>However, the mountain and river diagram was a treasure of the heavenly abode. It was isolated from the outside world, and sound could not enter at all. But how did this sound enter?</p><p>Obviously, Xie nianqing had also thought of this, and his expression changed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dandan flew over from afar and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder. She said, ” what’s this crying? it’s so unpleasant to hear. How did it even reach here? ”</p><p>“It’s coming from outside. Let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and dandan exited the mountain and river diagram together.</p><p>As soon as he got out of the mountain and river diagram, the crying sound became even clearer. It was coming from the east.</p><p>The two of them left the room and went to the courtyard.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked to the East, their eyes wide in shock.</p><p>It was night time, and the world was dark. The moon and stars were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>But on the east side, the sky was blood red.</p><p>It was like the sunset, but it was definitely not the sunset. The light rushed out from the ground and dyed the horizon red.</p><p>And that sorrowful cry was coming from that direction.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing flew out of the courtyard and into the sky, where they could see more clearly.</p><p>At this moment, the sky above the South God Palace was filled with people, all looking toward the east.</p><p>“Tuoba Shi, do you know what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked as Tuoba Shi was beside them.</p><p>“General Lu!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi cupped his fists and said, ” this period of time, I specially inquired about it. According to what I know, that direction is the direction where the divine Ruins are located. I heard that every year in the divine Ruins, such an abnormal phenomenon will happen. Blood light will dye the horizon red, and there will be cries coming out!</p><p>“Divine Ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were both slightly taken aback. They did not expect such a phenomenon to come from the divine Ruins.</p><p>the divine Ruins is very mysterious. Inside contains treasures like the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine, but it’s also very dangerous. There’s not much danger outside the divine Ruins, but inside, it’s very dangerous, especially the core region. Even if emperors enter, they’ve never seen anyone come out.</p><p>Tuoba Shi said.</p><p>This made Lu Ming and Xie nianqing even more shocked. It was indeed shocking that even an Emperor could not come out.</p><p>At this moment, the crying suddenly disappeared, but what came after was the sound of worship.</p><p>It was Grand and solemn. If one listened carefully, it sounded like a battle song.</p><p>cultivate my war spear, kill the nine Heavens, slaughter the alien races, return my mountains and rivers …</p><p>Vaguely, Lu Ming seemed to have heard these few sentences. They were filled with sorrow and were not afraid of death.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Vaguely, Lu Ming seemed to hear a Dragon’s Roar that shook the world.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. What on earth was in the divine Ruins? Lu Ming was extremely curious.</p><p>This strange phenomenon lasted for an entire night. It only disappeared when the sun rose the next day.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming saw many people flying toward the east.</p><p>“Eh? Could they be going to the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>It’s said that every year, an unusual phenomenon will happen in the divine Ruins, but for a period of time after the unusual phenomenon, the divine Ruins is the safest!</p><p>the divine Ruins are divided into the outer region, inner region, and core region by the people of the South God Palace!</p><p>normally, there’s no danger in the outer area, but the inner area is full of danger. Even a Supreme martial artist can die if they’re not careful. As for the core area, even emperors can’t come out!</p><p>however, for a period of time after the phenomenon, the inner region will become much safer. As long as one’s luck isn’t too bad, there won’t be any great danger. One can enter to search for treasures and Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi explained in detail. Clearly, he had found out a lot during this period of time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
