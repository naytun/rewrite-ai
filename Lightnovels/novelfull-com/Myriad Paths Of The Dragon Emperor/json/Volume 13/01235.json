They were too strong and could crush them.</p><p>“No, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>Shi du roared in his heart. He was extremely anxious and his mind was rapidly thinking of countermeasures.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>Seven days ago, Lu Ming was surrounded by Silver Wings and brutal wind. However, he was still alive and well. Lu Ming might be able to save him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, save me! Save me!” He quickly rushed toward Lu Ming and shouted:</p><p>“Why should I save you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a youth at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm made his move. A sword light shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and dispersed the sword light. The seventh level spiritual God Realm youth in blue frowned, while Shi DU’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming could block the attack of a seventh level spiritual God.</p><p>At this moment, it was as if Shi du had grabbed onto a life-saving straw.</p><p>“We come from the same place, the same continent. At this moment, we must work together!”</p><p>Lionheart shouted.</p><p>“United? Seven days ago, when I was trapped, why didn’t I see you working together?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Seven days ago, Lu Ming had also caught a glimpse of Shi DU’s figure from the corner of his eye. At that time, Shi du had escaped faster than anyone else and even gloated at his misfortune. Now, he needed his help? Wouldn’t that be laughable?</p><p>“I, I’m weak!”</p><p>Lionheart shouted.</p><p>“What’s the point of keeping trash with low strength in this world?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He moved and left Lion City.</p><p>“No, please save me!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming leave, the lion was so scared that it almost peed its pants. It wailed,”Lu Ming, save me. As long as you save me, I’m willing to be your Mount!”</p><p>“I’m not interested in a useless Mount like you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At that moment, a youth in blue at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm approached Lion City and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The lion roared unwillingly and fought with all its might, but it was useless. Its head was cut off by a sword.</p><p>Lion City, dead!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was the only one left among the youths who were surrounded.</p><p>let’s join forces. This person’s combat strength doesn’t seem weak!</p><p>A seventh level spiritual God Realm blue-robed youth spoke.</p><p>“Get lost, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not see Xie nianqing. He was a little disappointed and wanted to leave.</p><p>“Since you’ve seen us attack, you still want to leave? You’re really naive!”</p><p>A seventh level spiritual God Realm blue-robed youth sneered.</p><p>They came from a famous continent. However, if they used such an act to kill other geniuses and word got out, it would be bad for their reputation. Therefore, Lu Ming had to die.</p><p>“Why are you talking nonsense with him? let’s attack together, kill this person, and leave this place quickly!”</p><p>Another person coldly spoke.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Eight sword gleams shot toward Lu Ming, covering his entire body.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with eight streams of dragon energy and threw eight punches in a row.</p><p>The eight fist forces struck out and the eight sword lights instantly collapsed. However, the fist forces did not stop and continued to attack.</p><p>Two young men with weak cultivation were directly penetrated by the fist force.</p><p>The remaining four people spat out mouthfuls of blood and retreated with heavy injuries. Even the two seventh level spiritual God Realm geniuses retreated frantically, their expressions changing.</p><p>“Not good, this person is too strong. Let’s retreat!”</p><p>run! one of the seventh level spiritual God Realm geniuses shouted in fear, trying to escape.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, and the radiance of his fist enveloped the remaining six people.</p><p>A few consecutive screams were heard, and the remaining young men in blue were all killed. Even the two seventh level spiritual God Realm existences could only withstand a few more moves before they were killed.</p><p>In just a few moments, more than a dozen heaven’s favorites had died in this place.</p><p>These heaven’s pride experts stood at the peak of their respective continents. They looked down on their peers and looked down on invincible figures. They had awakened ninth level divine level bloodlines. In the future, it was a sure thing that they would become emperors.</p><p>But here, their lives were like grass, constantly being reaped.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more worried about Xie nianqing’s safety.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, nine blood-red keys were suspended. A beam of light shot into the sky.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in the mood to pay attention to it. He did not have the time to open a Hall and obtain the opportunities inside. He only wanted to find Xie nianqing first.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a step forward and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to the extreme as he flew into the distance.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, like a graceful swan, like a bolt of lightning, flashing through the air.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“A blood light?”</p><p>it looks like a blood-red light pillar!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, there was a blood-red light beam. As Lu Ming flew at high speed, it was like a huge blood-red iron rod sweeping across the void, attracting the attention of many people.</p><p>However, many people had only just seen it when the blood-red light pillar had already gone far away. It was simply too fast.</p><p>Lu Ming activated his spiritual sense to the maximum and spread it out in all directions, looking for Xie nianqing’s whereabouts.</p><p>Fortunately, this small world was not very big. Very soon, Lu Ming reached the end. There was a chaotic void in front of him. Lu Ming changed his direction and continued his search.</p><p>In the sky above a Lake, an intense battle was taking place.</p><p>Two experts in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm were fighting a beautiful woman together. The woman was Xie nianqing.</p><p>There were five blood-colored keys above Xie nianqing’s head.</p><p>As for the two youths at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, they each had five blood-colored keys.</p><p>The two seventh level spiritual God Realm experts couldn’t take down Xie nianqing for a while.</p><p>After more than seven days, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had improved again and reached the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm. However, her combat strength was extremely terrifying and she could fight two seventh level spiritual God Realm geniuses alone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Demonic Qi seethed from Xie nianqing’s body and formed terrifying demonic palm prints that blasted toward the other seventh level spiritual God Realm expert. The battle between the two of them was difficult to determine.</p><p>Not far from the battlefield, there were three other figures.</p><p>One of them was a burly young man with a huge golden ring on his nose. He crossed his arms and watched quietly.</p><p>On the side, two other young men stood respectfully beside him.</p><p>I didn’t expect that a woman who didn’t master martial techniques of creation would have such combat strength. It’s rare!</p><p>The young man with a pair of round nose rings said as he looked at Xie nianqing’s beautiful face. His eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“This woman is indeed powerful. If young master Niu can capture her, you can take her as your concubine!”</p><p>On the side, a young man revealed a flattering smile and flattered.</p><p>The young man with a pair of round nose rings seemed to be moved.”Yes, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>damn it, who is this woman? she actually has such combat strength. We have to take her down as soon as possible. We can’t be underestimated by young master Niu!</p><p>One of the young men who was attacking Xie nianqing growled in his heart.</p><p>The two of them gritted their teeth and attacked Xie nianqing with all their might.</p><p>For a moment, the demonic Qi around Xie nianqing was suppressed and he was at a disadvantage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
