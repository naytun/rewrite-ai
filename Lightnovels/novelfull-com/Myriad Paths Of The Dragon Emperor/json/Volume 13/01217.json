Once one’s control of the intent of heaven and earth reached the completion, the power of the intent would increase by a huge margin.</p><p>...</p><p>within seven days, I’ve managed to improve my fire concept from level four upper tier to level four complete tier. This place is a great opportunity for me!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Although it was only a step away from the peak of Level 4 upper tier to the perfected Level 4, the difference was like the difference between heaven and earth. Many geniuses would need at least half a year, or even a few years, to break through.</p><p>Some people might not even be able to break through in their entire lives.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s cultivation speed, he would need at least half a year to break through if he did not encounter any opportunities. However, he had broken through in seven days.</p><p>“Next, Thunder concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he began to comprehend the concept of Thunder.</p><p>Similarly, in seven days, Lu Ming’s Thunder concept had broken through to the full circle of level four.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the sky was filled with lightning. Bolts of lightning circled around Lu Ming.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Just as his Thunder mentality broke through to the complete stage of level four, the Thunder cauldron in his spiritual ocean, which had been silent for a few years, suddenly moved and vibrated slightly.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming felt that he had established a connection with the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained this lightning cauldron from the hundred deities slope. When he first saw it, the lightning cauldron was undergoing a Heavenly Tribulation, so Lu Ming put it away.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming had used it a few times. Although it would absorb Lu Ming’s life essence, it helped Lu Ming to overcome difficulties a few times.</p><p>Unfortunately, after being hit by Di Yi in the battle of ninedragons, it flew back to Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and fell silent. No matter how Lu Ming tried to sense or call, he could not get in touch with it.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming’s Thunder concept had broken through to the complete stage of level four, he was in contact with the Thunder cauldron again.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the Thunder concept and sensed the lightning cauldron carefully.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Thunder cauldron shook even more violently. In the end, it flew out from between Lu Ming’s brows and hovered above his head, exuding a Supreme might of Thunder.</p><p>“This pressure is so strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the lightning cauldron and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>The pressure coming from the lightning cauldron was even stronger than the pressure of an Emperor.</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>Lu Ming tried to control the lightning cauldron. He did not expect to be able to do it. The lightning cauldron flew up and down according to Lu Ming’s thoughts. It was many times stronger than before.</p><p>In the past, he could only activate the lightning cauldron when he was in a desperate situation. The lightning would absorb his true essence and also his life essence. Only then could he launch an attack. He couldn’t control it as freely as he could now.</p><p>however, I still feel that this lightning cauldron is unfathomable. I don’t know how much power I can unleash. However, even if I can unleash a little bit of power, it will be of great help to me!</p><p>“Let’s find an opportunity to try it out!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the lightning cauldron back into his consciousness.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to comprehend the other concepts.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Lu Ming’s essence realm of heaven and earth was improving rapidly.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly heard a sound not far away from him.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and quickly opened his eyes. There were other living creatures here. If they were to harm them, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>He opened his eyes and saw a ball of white hair wriggling not far away.</p><p>No, on closer look, it was actually a creature that looked very similar to a squirrel. It was chubby, round, and very meaty.</p><p>Moreover, its entire body was covered in white hair, each strand of white hair was sparkling and translucent, without the slightest impurity. Coupled with its chubby body, it was very cute.</p><p>It was not big, only the size of two fists. At this moment, it blinked its big black eyes and looked at Lu Ming curiously, chirping.</p><p>“There’s actually such a creature here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this place filled with enemies and no living creatures? On their way in, other than the headless true dragon Rider, Lu Ming and the rest did not encounter any other living creatures. Strictly speaking, the headless true dragon Rider was not considered a living creature.</p><p>“Could this be a spirit mouse? Strange, why would he appear here? And you’re not afraid of the endless killing intent here?”</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The white spirit mouse looked at Lu Ming curiously. It squeaked and wriggled its chubby body, wandering around Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully and realized that this white spirit mouse looked very ordinary.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and walked toward the white spirit mouse.</p><p>The white spirit mouse was shocked and ran away quickly. After running for a while, it stopped and turned around to look at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Little guy, what’s your name?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Demonic beasts that had reached the king’s realm could speak.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>However, the white spirit mouse only chirped and did not speak.</p><p>“Is he not in the king’s realm yet? However, how can one resist the endless killing intent here if they’re not King-level?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s curiosity was piqued and he chased after the white spirit mouse. The white spirit mouse turned around and ran. Its speed was unbelievably fast. In a flash, it had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“This … Is this the space mentality?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned and dumbfounded.</p><p>A white spiritual mouse could actually cast the space will. Moreover, it seemed more mysterious than the space will cast by yang potian and the Emperor God.</p><p>What kind of spirit mouse was this? What demonic beast?</p><p>Lu Ming had never heard of it.</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming shook his head and continued to sit cross-legged to comprehend the concept.</p><p>However, it didn’t take long for the chirping to start again.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and saw the white spirit mouse lying on its stomach not far away, looking at him.</p><p>“This guy!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He suddenly moved and pounced toward the white spirit mouse.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The white spirit mouse was shocked. It turned around and ran. With a flash of white light, it was far away in an instant. Lu Ming did not even see how it left.</p><p>isn’t his use of space a little too strong? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was really in a daze.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming continued to sit cross-legged.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming only closed his eyes and did not cultivate. Instead, he spread out his spiritual sense and paid attention to the situation around him.</p><p>As expected, not long after, there was a flash of white light and the white spirit mouse appeared not far from Lu Ming again. It sized him up curiously.</p><p>“Let’s see where you can run to this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile. The essential core in his body suddenly exploded, forming a essential core light shield that enveloped a radius of a thousand meters. Even the space was sealed by Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly moved. Like a ray of light, he pounced toward the white spirit mouse.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp …”</p><p>The White spiritual mouse squeaked, but there was no panic in its big eyes. It spat out a bubble from its mouth.</p><p>Yes, it was a bubble. The bubble expanded rapidly and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed into the bubble, he realized that his body had suddenly slowed down and he became as slow as a turtle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
