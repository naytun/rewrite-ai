The power of the fusion and explosion of five types of intents alone was already very shocking, not to mention the other intents.</p><p>...</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could easily crush the ordinary prodigies of the same level, even if they had awakened a ninth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>The scimitar exploded, and Lu Chengzhou’s body was sent flying far away. His entire body was almost torn apart, and he was covered in blood. Blood was also spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>“How could this be? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>He roared in his heart and was extremely frightened.</p><p>To be able to rank eighth among the 42 continents of the divine Ruins ‘continent cluster, he had many heaven’s favorites. To be able to rank second among the many heaven’s favorites, he was definitely below one person and above millions of people. He was invincible among his peers.</p><p>But now, he was seriously injured by Lu Ming in a few punches when they were at the same level. It was unbelievable.</p><p>All he could think of now was to escape. The further he ran, the better. However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch. A violent force was directed at Lu Chengzhou.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>Lu Chengzhou screamed hysterically, but in the next moment, his body exploded and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>The power of his blood gathered toward the keys. In the next moment, six blood-colored keys appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the six blood-red keys trembled as if they were resonating with each other and gave off dense blood-red light. The light from the six keys then gathered, forming an incredibly powerful blood-red pillar of light that shot into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, even though they were very far away from Lu Ming, they could see the blood-colored light pillar.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>what a dense blood light. Is there a rare treasure? ”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>One after another, figures pounced in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the light pillar above his head and was dumbfounded.</p><p>Could it be that gathering six keys would cause such a phenomenon?</p><p>It would be too difficult to gather all nine keys. Wouldn’t it be strange if other experts weren’t attracted by such a phenomenon? There was no place to hide.</p><p>It was too difficult to obtain the opportunity mentioned by the heavenly Divine sect.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then I’ll kill whoever tries to touch me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>He decided not to leave. He stood in the void and waited quietly.</p><p>Not long after-</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of breaking the air rang out continuously.</p><p>Seven or eight young men wearing feather clothes appeared first.</p><p>“It’s him. It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>One of them was mu Jue. He shouted as soon as he saw Lu Ming, his eyes gleaming coldly.</p><p>six keys. A piece of trash from the divine wilderness continent actually managed to gather six keys. It seems like his luck is pretty good. The moment he arrived, he encountered a pile of even more trash!</p><p>A young man with black wings sneered.</p><p>How strong could a person from the divine wilderness continent be? for him to be able to gather six keys, he must have encountered an even trashier continent, which was why Lu Ming had six keys.</p><p>“Kill him and I can gather the nine keys!”</p><p>A young man in silver feather clothes licked his lips and sneered.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, let’s see how you’re going to die this time! You were lucky last time!”</p><p>Mu Jue laughed.</p><p>There were seven prodigies from the White Feather continent. One of them was the young man in the White Feather robe who had stepped onto the 36 Phecda peaks. He was high and mighty, and he stood above all the other prodigies.</p><p>With the paragons of the White Feather continent around, he was sure that Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of air being torn continued to ring out. A group of young men appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>The one in the lead had a green beard and an extremely powerful aura.</p><p>“There are six keys. Haha, these six keys are mine!”</p><p>The green-bearded young man’s eyes glowed with a scorching light when he saw the six blood-colored keys above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>There were four keys above his head. Including Lu Ming’s, he had nine keys.</p><p>“Brutal wind, it’s you!”</p><p>On the White Feather continent, the expression of the young man in silver feather clothes changed slightly.</p><p>The green-bearded young man came from the yellow mang continent and was ranked fifth in the continent group of the divine Ruins. He was also an expert who had reached the 36 Phecda peaks.</p><p>haha, Silver Wing, what a coincidence!</p><p>The green-bearded youth grinned.</p><p>“Man Feng, I found this kid first. You’d better leave as soon as possible!”</p><p>Silver Wing said coldly.</p><p>hahaha, this is ridiculous. This is the test of the tianshen sect. Who told you that first come, first served, it all depends on your ability. The key will belong to whoever kills him first!</p><p>Man Feng grinned and laughed. He looked very simple and honest, but the cruel killing intent in his eyes made people’s hearts turn cold.</p><p>At this moment, from other directions, there were also sounds of flying. Another young genius had arrived.</p><p>However, when they saw man Feng and silver Wing, their expressions changed.</p><p>not good, it’s the heaven’s favorites who have reached the 36th peak. Retreat!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The people who came later all retreated with a change in expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming is dead!”</p><p>One of them was the divine wilderness continent’s proud Son of Heaven, Shi du. At that moment, his eyes flickered with a gloating light as he fled far away.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the silver Wings suddenly burst out. A pair of Silver Wings appeared on his back. He pounced at Lu Ming like a bolt of silver lightning. His sharp claws could tear through everything as he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Silver Wing, you’re despicable. You actually sneak attacked him. This kid is mine!</p><p>Man Feng roared in anger, and a beast’s roar came from his body. He took a few steps in the air and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them had completely regarded Lu Ming as their prey, their key provider.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming’s fate was already set. He was dead. They had to be on guard against the other party.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>Silver wing’s eyes were cold. He had killed Lu Ming in one move. In that case, he would kill Lu Ming first and Lu Ming’s blood-red key would naturally belong to him.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re just ignoring me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He shifted his feet slightly and dodged the silver wing’s grasp.</p><p>“Brat, you still dare to Dodge? die!”</p><p>The silver Wing bellowed and its claws swiped at Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to Dodge. He was furious. He had seized the opportunity with great difficulty. If Lu Ming dodged, would he not lose it?</p><p>In his heart, he would not even consider the fact that he wanted to kill Lu Ming. Was it not normal for Lu Ming to Dodge?</p><p>He was only thinking that if Lu Ming dodged, he would destroy his opportunity.</p><p>“Then I won’t Dodge!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Then-</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely shocking aura burst out from his body. The aura of the seventh level spiritual God Realm was completely released. The five-colored concept surrounded him as he punched out.</p><p>This punch landed on one of Silver wing’s claws.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking was heard. Silver Wing screamed and retreated quickly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
