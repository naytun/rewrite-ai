He looked into the distance and muttered, ” “divine ruins!”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>at that moment, the middle-aged man from the heaven God sect spoke and stepped forward. The space in front of him split open and he brought young master Lin into the space and disappeared.</p><p>The master of the MU family and mu ye also tore the space apart and chased in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had left.</p><p>In a flash, the space above the divine Ruins split open, and the figures of the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect, the master of the MU family, and the others appeared.</p><p>“They escaped into the divine Ruins!”</p><p>The master of the MU family spoke with a grave expression.</p><p>“Why aren’t you chasing?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>This place is the divine Ruins, it’s very dangerous. Even emperors who enter have the risk of dying!</p><p>The MU family’s master said.</p><p>“Even emperors are in danger? Hehe, I think you’re exaggerating. I’ve just carefully scanned this place with my spiritual sense. It’s just a ruin without any living creatures, so how could it be dangerous?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect smiled faintly.</p><p>He was confident enough that there was nothing in the divine Ruins continent that could threaten him.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>The MU family’s master and mu ye were a little hesitant.</p><p>The legends of the divine Ruins throughout history made them very fearful.</p><p>“A dignified Emperor is actually afraid of this and that, afraid of his head and feet, how can he achieve great things? Fine, if you don’t go, I’ll go myself!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect said indifferently with a hint of disdain in his voice.</p><p>Not to mention that he didn’t believe that this place could bring him any danger, even if there was a little danger, he would still try.</p><p>Lu Ming’s Thunder cauldron was suspected to be a holy weapon, which made him drool.</p><p>Furthermore, dandan and bubbles might very well have the bloodline of one of the top ten combat beasts, which was even more tempting to him. If he could capture them and nurture them well, they would be of great help in the future.</p><p>He was determined to get all of this.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect stepped out and headed into the divine Ruins, followed by young master Lin.</p><p>The MU family’s master and mu ye looked at each other, their eyes uncertain. Finally, they gritted their teeth and followed the middle-aged heavenly deity in large strides, walking towards the divine Ruins.</p><p>It was not easy for them to curry favor with the other party. The other party had the Tian Shen sect behind him. This was a once in a thousand years opportunity, and they did not want to miss it.</p><p>The few of them passed through the divine Ruins ‘periphery very quickly and entered the inner region.</p><p>He passed through the inner area and appeared outside the core area.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect did not hesitate at all. He stepped into the core area with the master of the MU family and the others following behind him.</p><p>There were some broken formations in the core area. Some of them were very powerful, but they were not much of a threat to a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“Just these broken formations scared you so much that you don’t dare to come in?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect laughed.</p><p>The MU family’s master did not say anything and was still on guard.</p><p>He had never entered the core of the divine Ruins before. He only knew that it was very dangerous here. Even emperors would die if they entered. As for what kind of danger it was, he did not know.</p><p>Soon, they passed through a large area and arrived in front of an intact Palace.</p><p>“There’s actually an intact Palace here?”</p><p>The MU family’s master revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming and the others are in this Palace. They can’t escape.”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect laughed casually.</p><p>The MU family’s master and mu ye nodded. They sensed carefully and could only sense the auras of Lu Ming and the others in the hall. There were no auras of any other living creatures other than Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“I’ll go chase them out!”</p><p>Mu ye took the initiative to ask.</p><p>Previously, he was actually injured by Lu Ming and the rest. This made him feel embarrassed. At this moment, he was anxious to prove himself.</p><p>With that, mu ye stepped forward. The pressure of an Emperor emanated from his body.</p><p>“Do you think that hiding in a run-down Hall is useful? I’m going to destroy this broken Hall and have you all get the hell out!”</p><p>Mu ye said coldly. His claw pressed down in the air, and a withered claw as large as a mountain formed. It grabbed at the palace, trying to tear it apart.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a jet-black spear radiance shot out of the palace and shattered the withered claw into pieces.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a second spear light appeared in the palace, and its target was mu ye.</p><p>The speed of the spear ray was unimaginably fast. In a flash, it had arrived in front of mu ye.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Before mu ye could even react, his body was pierced by the spear light. A hole appeared in his dantian.</p><p>No matter what territory or spirit body it was, they were as fragile as tofu in front of this spear light.</p><p>Mu ye’s eyes were wide open. His eyes were filled with unwillingness and disbelief.</p><p>Slowly, the vitality in his eyes dissipated and completely disappeared.</p><p>Mu ye had fallen!</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The MU family’s master and the middle-aged man from the heaven God sect had a drastic change in their expressions as they roared in disbelief.</p><p>They had clearly not sensed any signs of life in the palace, so why would there be an attack? furthermore, it was so shocking. One move had killed an Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The next moment, their eyes widened.</p><p>They saw two figures holding hands as they walked out of the Hall’s entrance. It was Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“So it’s you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at young master Lin and the middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect. His face was gloomy.</p><p>I really didn’t expect that the deity sect, a great sect in the yuan continent, would be so despicable. They were not my opponent, but they attacked me in the dark. Hehe, it’s a good thing I didn’t join such a sect!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his voice filled with mockery.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>young master Lin scolded and his face was really ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming was obviously talking about him.</p><p>“How dare you! When did it become your turn to judge the actions of my Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled disdainfully. He could not be bothered to look at the two people from the deity sect. His gaze fell on the master of the MU family.”I want to know who you are. Why did you send people to kill me?”</p><p>It was obvious that the six great Supremes and the Emperor had been sent by this person.</p><p>“You killed my son mujue. Do you think I should kill you?”</p><p>The MU family’s master’s gloomy voice rang out. He took off his black hat, revealing a gloomy face.</p><p>“The MU family, it’s the MU family indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had already guessed that it would be either the MU family or the Wang family.</p><p>“Since you want to kill me, then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The MU family’s master and the middle-aged man from the heaven God sect changed their expressions. They looked at the palace with fear.</p><p>The spearlight just now had killed a Lv 1 martial Royal realm martial artist with one move. Its combat strength was no weaker than that of a Lv 3 martial Royal realm martial artist.</p><p>Hmph, who cares who he is? since he doesn’t dare to show himself, he can’t be that strong either. Let’s attack together and take down Lu Ming. We’ll leave quickly!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The master of the MU family nodded.</p><p>The MU family had lost an Emperor because of this. This was a huge loss. It was impossible for him to stop now. He had to kill Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
