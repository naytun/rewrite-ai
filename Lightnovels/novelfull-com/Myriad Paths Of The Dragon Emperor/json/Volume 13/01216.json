The feeling was countless times stronger than when he was facing Xie Luan.</p><p>“This is … Saint heart? No, it doesn’t seem like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>At first, he thought that it was a saint’s heart left behind by a Saint. Lu Ming had seen a saint’s heart left behind by a mysterious sky Saint before, but upon closer inspection, it did not look like it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black bead buzzed, and then, as if it had a mind of its own, it shot into the sky.</p><p>“I knew it!”</p><p>As he spoke, inscriptions appeared all around him. A large formation was formed, forming countless dense silk ribbons that blocked the black bead like an inescapable net.</p><p>The black bead didn’t manage to charge out, so it immediately changed direction and charged, but it was still blocked by the formation.</p><p>The black bead dashed left and right, and the demonic Qi was monstrous. Unfortunately, it didn’t rush out. Dandan was prepared and set up the formation just in case. Naturally, it was not that simple.</p><p>At this moment, the demonic Qi around Xie nianqing’s body became even more intense. Her bloodline was glowing as if it was resonating with the Black Pearl.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, the black bead seemed to have no choice but to turn around and fly directly towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he wanted to stop her.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re being too concerned. This is a great opportunity for this girl!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he stopped. He knew that his concern had made him confused.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black bead flew into Xie nianqing’s forehead and disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want to cultivate here for a while!” He said.</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, Xie nianqing sat down cross-legged and a layer of demonic light enveloped him like a cocoon formed from demonic Qi.</p><p>dandan, could that be the saint’s heart left behind by a Saint? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“It’s not the Saint heart!”</p><p>Dandan shook her head, her small eyes shining, and said, ” that’s the core left behind by someone who’s even more powerful than a Saint, and it’s a hundred times more precious than a saint’s heart. That’s why I said that this girl has obtained a great opportunity. Fortunately, the owner of this thing died in battle long ago, and after countless years, the killing intent and thoughts on it have long dissipated. There’s not much energy left. Otherwise, we would all be dead, let alone this girl getting the inheritance!</p><p>“Even stronger than a Sage?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Right now, even emperors were insurmountable mountains to him, while Saints were countless times stronger than emperors. Furthermore, there were existences even stronger than Saints.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s move on. No one else can enter this place. Your little lover will be fine. I have a feeling that there’s an opportunity waiting for us ahead!”</p><p>Dandan looked forward, her eyes shining.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s move forward and see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, the human and turtle continued on their way.</p><p>In front of them was still a ruin, but the outline could still be seen. It should also be a Palace, but it was broken and fell here, so it was already in a state of ruin.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a huge creature lying in front of him.</p><p>It was the headless true dragon Rider.</p><p>The black headless true dragon lay on the ground, while the headless rider sat quietly on the true Dragon’s body. He held the Dragon Spear in his hand and remained motionless.</p><p>Beside the headless true dragon Knight, there was a piece of land with all sorts of weapons stuck upside down. However, they seemed to have been corroded and were in tatters.</p><p>He could even see all kinds of battle armors, which, like the weapons, were rotten.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, there were many skeletons under the weapons and armors.</p><p>Could these be the burial grounds of the powerhouses who had died in battle? The headless true dragon Riders were guarding this place?</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed in his heart.</p><p>“That is … Ten thousand spirit crystals? I’m rich, I’m rich!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes suddenly lit up, and she ran forward madly, rushing into the land full of bones, and then dug out a colorful crystal the size of a human head from the center.</p><p>This guy hugged the Jingshi and actually began to gnaw on it. Ka Cha ka Cha, he ate with great relish.</p><p>During this process, the headless true dragon Knight didn’t move and didn’t stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode forward.</p><p>When he entered the field of bones, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Countless roars filled with murderous intent suddenly exploded in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>It was an extremely powerful killing intent. It was the killing intent of those powerhouses who were unwilling to die.</p><p>One by one, they were too powerful. If it was anyone else, they would have been instantly drowned by this endless killing intent and turned into an idiot.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was different. The killing intent in his third bloodline was countless times stronger than the killing intent here. Lu Ming was often faced with such killing intent and had long learned how to resist it. He could keep his mind clear in the face of endless killing intent.</p><p>what a strong killing intent, but it’s useless against me. But dandan is too unreliable. He didn’t even warn me. If it were anyone else, they would be in danger!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Dandan was still holding that piece of crystal and nibbling on it, her eyes narrowed, a very enjoyable expression on her face.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>The killing intent was filled with an intense unwillingness and unyielding battle intent, as if it wanted to kill the world and kill the enemy.</p><p>“Eh? What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he closed his eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the surrounding environment seemed to have changed. Lu Ming came to a vast land with countless light pillars soaring into the sky.</p><p>The light pillars were the auras of the essence realm of heaven and earth. No, in essence, they were countless times stronger than the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>“This is … Left behind by those experts? It’s about intent, or is it an understanding that’s even stronger than intent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he was overjoyed.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming could sense auras similar to the fire concept, Thunder concept, and so on in the light pillars. He could find all five concepts that he had comprehended.</p><p>if I can comprehend here, I can quickly increase my domain of heaven and earth!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This was a great opportunity for him.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to comprehend quietly.</p><p>Dandan, on the other hand, quickly finished eating the ten thousand spirit crystal and lay there, motionless, her whole body glowing.</p><p>“Fire concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming first comprehended the concept of fire.</p><p>Currently, his fire and Thunder concepts were the strongest and had already reached the peak of level four upper tier. He was only one step away from completing level four.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s fire concept was rapidly improving.</p><p>Just like that, time passed day by day. Seven days later, Lu Ming broke through his fire concept in one fell swoop, making him the first to reach the full circle of level four.</p><p>The full completion of level four intent realm was already the highest level. The next step would be the domain Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On Lu Ming’s body, there was a layer of flames jumping and burning through the space.</p><p>Grand completion of level four, so strong!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with joy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
