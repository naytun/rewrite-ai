You barely qualify for the test. However, whether you can get the chaos Scripture and successfully cultivate it will still require a series of tests!</p><p>...</p><p>Earth One looked at the five intents surrounding Lu Ming and nodded slightly. There was a glimmer of hope in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He was amazed by the insane conditions for cultivating the chaos Scripture.</p><p>First of all, he had to comprehend the concepts of five completely different attributes.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s earth, wind, fire, Thunder, and water concepts were five completely different concepts.</p><p>If Lu Ming cultivated the earth concept and the other one was the mountain concept or the earth concept, it would not work.</p><p>This was because the mountain concept, earth concept, and earth concept had the same attributes.</p><p>Or, it would be impossible even if one cultivated the water concept, ice concept, swamp concept, and so on, because the fundamental attributes were the same.</p><p>Only the intent of five completely different elements had been cultivated to the full circle of level four. This condition was hard to find even one in a billion geniuses.</p><p>Furthermore, he had to successfully merge all five intents. This was even more difficult and harsh.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline, he would not have been able to achieve it.</p><p>Lu Ming could not imagine who else in the world could meet such a requirement other than him.</p><p>And this was only the preliminary requirements of the test. If he wanted to cultivate, he still needed to go through the test.</p><p>well, that’s all I have to say. Now, take the test. Go through that passage and keep going. If you can walk to the end, you will get the chaos Scripture and cultivate the chaos will. If you fail halfway, you will be teleported out, and I will send you back!</p><p>also, in this place, time is accelerated many times. Even if you stay here for a few years, only a moment will pass in the outside world. So, you can rest assured and accept the test!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>“A few years here is only a short while in the outside world?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was overjoyed.</p><p>What he was worried about was that if he stayed here for too long, there would be changes in the outside world, like dandan and bubbles, or the situation in the divine wilderness.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming did not need to worry.</p><p>A few years here was only a short while in the outside world. What was there to worry about?</p><p>At the same time, he marveled at Hunyuan sect’s strength.</p><p>Hunyuan sect. What kind of power was that? it was truly unfathomable and unimaginably powerful.</p><p>I must get the chaos Scripture!</p><p>With his worries gone, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He clenched his fists.</p><p>If he could successfully cultivate the legendary chaos will, his combat power would increase by a terrifying amount. It would become his most powerful trump card.</p><p>More importantly, the help it would bring in the future would be unimaginable.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze slowly became determined.</p><p>“Senior Earth One, this junior will be going!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at tu Yiyi and stepped forward, walking towards the passage. His figure slowly disappeared into the passage.</p><p>how many years has it been? I’ve finally waited for someone. This time, I must succeed!</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s disappearing back, tu Yi’s eyes were filled with hope and anticipation.</p><p>He had already waited for countless years. Over the long years, there were also outstanding heaven’s favorites who met the requirements and were brought here.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one had been able to make it to the end, pass all the tests, and cultivate the chaos will.</p><p>Therefore, he could only wait.</p><p>Every time someone came, it was a ray of hope. He was filled with anticipation and hoped that someone would succeed in cultivating it.</p><p>Earth One stood quietly in the hall and waited.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the passage. At first, everything was calm. However, after walking for a while, the surrounding environment suddenly changed.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, roars filled with killing intent were heard. Endless killing intent suddenly enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned red. It was as if countless wild beasts had been triggered in his heart. Lu Ming’s heart was filled with endless murderous intent.</p><p>This kind of killing intent was too cold and too strong. An ordinary person would turn into an idiot if they were struck by this kind of killing intent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes only flickered for a moment at the beginning. He immediately calmed down.</p><p>it’s another test of killing intent. However, it’s far inferior to the endless killing intent of the third bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. His gaze became calmer and calmer, not affected by his killing intent.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming also understood why there was a test of killing intent.</p><p>This was because in a warrior’s life, if he wanted to reach the peak, he had to kill his way out from mountains of corpses and seas of blood. This path was destined to be a bloody one, a path filled with killing intent. Those who were not determined would be influenced by the killing intent.</p><p>Therefore, some of the more powerful inheritances would set up a test to test the killing intent.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming’s third bloodline had endless killing intent. These tests were child’s play compared to the third bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming remained unmoved despite the killing intent enveloping him. His eyes were calm as he walked forward step by step, determined.</p><p>Suddenly, the surrounding environment changed again.</p><p>The endless killing intent disappeared without a trace.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>A melodious chirping of birds rang in Lu Ming’s ears. It was crisp and pleasant.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew, bringing with it waves of fragrant flowers that refreshed one’s mind.</p><p>It was completely different from the endless killing intent just now. Lu Ming could not help but calm down.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up and realized that he was outside a small mountain village.</p><p>In front of them was a small mountain village.</p><p>The small village was surrounded by green grass and colorful flowers. Birds were flying and chirping, making the village look like a paradise.</p><p>Ding Ling Ling!</p><p>A melodious voice rang out. It was a six or seven-year-old girl. She was very pink and had a red face. She was very cute. There was a string of bells on her wrists and ankles. When she walked, they made melodious sounds.</p><p>The little girl jogged to Lu Ming’s side and looked at him curiously. She whispered, ” “Big brother, are you an outsider? Are you lost? Come to my house, Lingling will treat you to milk tea!”</p><p>With that, the little girl pulled Lu Ming’s big hand and walked towards the village. She was so innocent and cute that Lu Ming could not bear to reject her.</p><p>“Hello, young man!”</p><p>An honest-looking man was carrying a bunch of firewood. When he saw Lu Ming, he smiled and greeted him.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming knew that this was an illusion, he could not help but be influenced by this simplicity. A smile appeared on his face and he nodded at the burly man.</p><p>“Mother, this big brother is lost. I brought him here as a guest to treat him to milk tea!”</p><p>The little girl pulled Lu Ming and walked into the village. They came to a wooden house.</p><p>In front of the wooden house, there was a young woman in her thirties. When she saw Lu Ming, she flashed a clean smile and patted the little girl’s head lovingly. since you’re Ling Ling’s friend, you’re also mother’s friend. Wait here, I’ll go get the milk tea!</p><p>The young woman walked into the house and quickly took out a tea brick to make tea for Lu Ming. Very soon, the strong fragrance of milk tea wafted in front of the wooden house.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
