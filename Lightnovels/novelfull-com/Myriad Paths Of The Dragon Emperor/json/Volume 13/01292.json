Can you buy me a drink too?”</p><p>...</p><p>A white-haired old man walked over and smiled.</p><p>“Fifth Grandpa, of course you can!”</p><p>The little girl said with a smile.</p><p>The small mountain village was very simple. No one was scheming and their smiles were clean. Lu Ming could not help but be infected. He picked up the milk tea and took a sip. It was very sweet.</p><p>“Big brother, is it good?”</p><p>The little girl blinked her big eyes and asked.</p><p>“It’s good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Thank you, big brother!”</p><p>The little girl revealed a happy smile and jumped around. The bells on her wrists and ankles rang with a pleasant sound.</p><p>The people in the small mountain village were all very simple. Lu Ming’s arrival attracted many people to watch. However, most of them were very simple and honest. They smiled at Lu Ming, and their smiles revealed their sincerity.</p><p>“I wonder what this illusionary realm will test?”</p><p>Lu Ming sipped his milk tea and a thought flashed across his mind.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a slight sound of the air being cut. It was very light, like a child holding a sharp blade and stabbing it at Lu Ming. The sound was very light.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming’s cultivation level, he could still hear it clearly.</p><p>It was Lingling, the little girl. A dagger appeared in her hand and she stabbed it at Lu Ming’s stomach.</p><p>At this moment, the little girl was not naive at all. Her face was filled with ferocity.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The little girl shouted and stabbed the dagger straight at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated slightly and dodged the little girl’s attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A cold shout came from behind. The little girl’s mother, the kind young woman, was also holding a sword and stabbing at Lu Ming with a ferocious expression.</p><p>Following that, the old man on the right, the little girl’s fifth Grandpa, who was simple and honest earlier, also took out a knife and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Their strength was very small and weak, just like an ordinary villager. However, each of them seemed to have a deep hatred for Lu Ming and wanted to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated casually and dodged all the attacks.</p><p>However, they did not give up and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Other than the little girl and the rest, the other villagers also took out their weapons and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>However, no one said a word. They charged at Lu Ming with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>When Lu Ming retreated, they continued to charge at him.</p><p>All around the small mountain village, the originally simple and honest villagers rushed towards Lu Ming as if they had gone mad. They wanted to kill Lu Ming, and all kinds of weapons were thrust and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged the attack. He wanted to soar into the sky and leave this place, but he realized that he could not. He was blocked by a force.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More and more villagers charged at Lu Ming with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>Ding Ling Ling!</p><p>The little girl, Lingling, was at the forefront. She aimed a dagger at Lu Ming’s stomach.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged continuously but the number of villagers increased and they surrounded him in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned colder and colder.</p><p>I don’t kill innocent people, but if you want to kill me, then I’m not innocent. Since we’re enemies, then I’ll kill you!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming uttered the word ‘kill’, a cold killing intent burst out from his body. A long spear appeared in his hands. With a flash of the long spear, the sky was filled with spear shadows.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The spear was thrust out, and the first to bear the brunt was the little girl. The spear ray pierced through the space between her eyebrows, nailing her to the ground.</p><p>After that, it was the young woman and the simple-minded fifth grandfather …</p><p>An originally kind and simple person had been assassinated by Lu Ming.</p><p>At first, Lu Ming’s heart trembled. However, his gaze was soon replaced by a cold look.</p><p>On the path of martial arts, since he had to kill, he would kill them thoroughly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The spear ray howled. How could these villagers resist it? they were killed one by one. Corpses covered the mountain village and blood dyed the Paradise Red.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and walked out of the mountain village.</p><p>There were still villagers charging at Lu Ming from all directions. In the end, they all turned into corpses.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming stepped out of the village and saw a town that was even bigger than the previous village.</p><p>Many people saw Lu Ming and shouted with red eyes, ” murderer! He’s killing the innocent! Kill him!</p><p>In the town, more and more people were charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have a choice. He could only kill his way out.</p><p>Blood Qi filled the air, and millions of corpses lay on the ground.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming went, everyone who saw him would want to kill him. Lu Ming had no choice but to kill them.</p><p>Slowly, Lu Ming’s eyes turned red. He exuded a cold killing intent and his gaze became colder and colder.</p><p>……</p><p>Outside, in the Great Hall, Earth One was staring at a round ball in front of him.</p><p>The image on the ball was the one where Lu Ming was.</p><p>Suddenly, a ripple appeared in the space, and a golden figure appeared beside Earth One.</p><p>“Gold one!”</p><p>Earth One nodded.</p><p>“How is it? You can’t even pass the first stage, right?”</p><p>Gold one said.</p><p>I don’t know. The first stage is very difficult. A martial arts expert can’t be soft-hearted. If he meets an enemy, he must kill them no matter what. This is necessary. If he’s soft-hearted, he’ll only die in the hands of the enemy!</p><p>however, in the endless slaughter, in the mountains of corpses and seas of blood, you have to stay clear-headed and keep your heart unchanged. Some people’s hearts will slowly change in the endless slaughter and eventually turn into killing machines. But that’s useless!</p><p>Dao tuyi’s brows furrowed slightly.</p><p>that’s right. Humans are easily lost!</p><p>Gold one said.</p><p>Suddenly, the space moved again, and a few more figures appeared. They were puppets like tu Yi, but their colors were different.</p><p>They were lightning one, wood one, water one, and so on.</p><p>The moment these figures appeared, they all stared at the round ball without blinking.</p><p>“It’s been so many years. I hope this kid can pass!”</p><p>Gold one sighed. Everyone looked on silently.</p><p>Lu Ming’s massacre continued.</p><p>His eyes were getting redder and redder, and the killing intent on his body was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill! Kill everything!”</p><p>There was a voice in his mind that kept roaring, as if it wanted to drown Lu Ming in endless slaughter.</p><p>This kind of killing intent, this kind of killing intent, was born in Lu Ming’s heart, not from the outside world. Even the third bloodline could not help Lu Ming.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>It was the voice from the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Lu Ming shivered and his mind regained a trace of clarity.</p><p>that’s not right. I, Lu Ming, have only killed my enemies and not the innocent. No matter how many enemies I kill, they are still my enemies and have nothing to do with others. Even if I have to kill, I’ll kill those who deserve to be killed!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and his eyes slowly regained clarity.</p><p>In the end, he simply sat down cross-legged and his mind entered a state of emptiness.</p><p>In the outside world, the attacks landed on Lu Ming’s body and dissipated one after another, unable to hurt him at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
