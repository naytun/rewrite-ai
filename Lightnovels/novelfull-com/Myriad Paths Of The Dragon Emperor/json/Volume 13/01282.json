He used his left hand to exert the devouring power and enveloped the monster. The fingers on his right hand grew longer and became like dragon claws. He clawed out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the monster’s head with his right hand and tore it apart with all his might. The monster’s head was directly torn off, and blood gushed out wildly, but it was all devoured by Lu Ming’s devouring power.</p><p>what dense blood essence power! The demonic power in it is even more shocking!</p><p>After devouring the monster’s blood essence and demonic energy, Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>This monster was also a type of demonic beast. However, the demonic power in its body was astonishing. The power of its blood essence was also extremely dense, far exceeding that of ordinary human warriors.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation had already reached a bottleneck. Devouring and refining would not be of much help to him.</p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p>A brutal fight was taking place in the depths of the ocean.</p><p>Although the dozens of underwater monsters were powerful, the Supreme-being of the human race was still able to kill them easily.</p><p>In the end, dozens of humans died, but the dozens of monsters were all killed one by one.</p><p>Then, everyone continued to dive, but they were more careful.</p><p>As expected, they were attacked again not long after.</p><p>It was a strange fish. It wasn’t big and looked exactly like a rock. Even its aura was the same as a rock, as if it had no life.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming and the rest approached, the stone-like fish suddenly launched an attack.</p><p>This type of fish wasn’t particularly strong, but there were many of them and they were extremely poisonous.</p><p>If a great circle spirit God expert was bitten by this fish, they would be poisoned and paralyzed, unable to fight back.</p><p>In this battle, another dozen powerhouses died.</p><p>In the end, he had to rely on the strength of a Supreme martial artist to kill the group of fish that were as hard as rocks.</p><p>However, no one retreated. The temptation of a pure spirit body was too great. Since they had already come this far, no one wanted to return empty-handed.</p><p>Everyone continued to dive.</p><p>In total, they had already reached a depth of three hundred thousand meters. The water pressure here was simply unimaginable.</p><p>Moreover, it was pitch black. With Lu Ming’s vision, he could only see a radius of a thousand meters. The others might be able to see even closer.</p><p>“We’ve reached the bottom!”</p><p>Someone said. Everyone was relieved. They had finally reached the end. Was the pure spirit body cultivation method here?</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s a crack!”</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>Everyone quickly gathered over and found a crack. It seemed to be a space tunnel.</p><p>this is a Space Channel. The cultivation method of a pure spirit body must be hidden inside!</p><p>The same thought appeared in everyone’s mind, and their eyes couldn’t help but light up.</p><p>Just as someone was about to rush in, in the distance, the sea water churned and an angry roar came.</p><p>“How dare you invade my ancestral land! All of you must die!”</p><p>The roar was like a Dragon’s Roar, passing through the rolling sea and rumbling.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a large group of black behemoths charging toward them.</p><p>Demonic beasts, they were all demonic beasts, and they were all ocean demonic beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming saw huge octopuses, ferocious-looking sharks, and slender eels.</p><p>The one in the lead was covered in black scales. It had dragon horns and four claws under its belly. It was a flood Dragon.</p><p>It was a black water dragon.</p><p>Moreover, the flood Dragon’s body had a strong true Dragon’s pressure. It obviously contained a strong true dragon’s bloodline. Its terrifying aura could make people feel frightened even from far away.</p><p>Supreme, this flood Dragon is a Supreme-being expert. It contains 90% of the true dragon’s bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank slightly.</p><p>A Supreme flood Dragon with 90% of the true dragon’s bloodline would definitely have terrifying combat strength.</p><p>Behind the flood Dragon sovereign, the auras of many ocean demonic beasts were extremely astonishing. Many of them were at the Supreme-being level.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>“Charge into the spatial tunnel!”</p><p>Many of the human experts cried out in shock as they turned around and charged into the spatial tunnel.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>With a loud roar, the flood Dragon sovereign extended his Black Dragon Claw, which rapidly expanded in size as it clawed towards the humans.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In an instant, more than a dozen high-level spiritual gods were crushed by the dragon’s claws, their bodies and souls destroyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon Claw didn’t stop as it clawed at one of the Supreme martial artists.</p><p>The Supreme-being’s expression changed, and a snow-white saber appeared in his hand. The saber radiance was astonishing, and it broke through the sea water to grab the Dragon Claw.</p><p>With a bang, the blade-light collapsed. The body of the human race’s Supreme-being trembled violently. His face turned pale, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood as he was sent flying.</p><p>The gap was too great. They were both Supremes, but the human race’s Supremes were no match for him.</p><p>This was the bottom of the ocean, which was an advantage for flood Dragons. Furthermore, the flood Dragon Supreme contained 90% of the true dragon’s bloodline, which was similar to the human race awakening a ninth level divine bloodline. He was a genius among geniuses and was extremely powerful.</p><p>At that moment, some of the human powerhouses had already rushed into the space tunnel and disappeared.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>Seeing this, the flood Dragon sovereign became even more furious. He roared again and again and struck out with his dragon claws.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The space was torn apart, and the seawater gushed into the space crack and disappeared.</p><p>A Dragon Claw swiped at Hai Tian and the others.</p><p>“Protect the young master!”</p><p>On the edge of the sea and sky, a few Supreme martial artists roared and attacked the Black Dragon Claw together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying explosion instantly evaporated over ten thousand tons of seawater, creating a vacuum.</p><p>A few Supreme martial artists joined forces and blocked the Black Dragon Claw.</p><p>“So many experts, die!”</p><p>Hai Tian’s group attracted the black water Dragon’s attention. Its eyes were cold as it stared at Hai Tian and the others. It let out a dragon roar and pounced toward them.</p><p>At the same time, a few Supreme-being marine demonic beasts followed the flood Dragon and pounced toward Hai Tian and the others.</p><p>Under the sea, the ocean demonic beasts already had the advantage. At this moment, the Supreme martial artists joined forces and their might was astonishing. Hai Tian’s expression changed greatly, and he was incomparably frightened.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Even the Joint Forces of a few Supreme-beings could not stop the flood Dragon Supreme-being and were sent flying.</p><p>“Big brother, save me!”</p><p>Hai Tian shouted in fear.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Hai Yu stepped forward and appeared beside Hai Tian. He activated his domain and a huge battle-axe appeared in his hand. He swung the axe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The axe and the black flood dragon’s claws collided, creating a shocking force that formed a storm. Some of the weaker Supreme-beings couldn’t even stand still.</p><p>Hai Yu was also an existence who had awakened a ninth level divine rank bloodline. His combat strength was extremely shocking and was not any weaker than the flood Dragon sovereign. Even if he was at the bottom of the sea, he would not be much weaker.</p><p>As the two of them collided, the bodies of the flood Dragon sovereign and Hai Yu swayed slightly, and they were forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>there’s actually an expert like you. But this is the bottom of the sea. Stay here!</p><p>The black water dragon roared and attacked Hai Yu again.</p><p>“Bring Hai Tian into the spatial tunnel. I’ll stop them!”</p><p>Hai Yu ordered the other Supremes before he used his bloodline fusion to fight with the flood Dragon.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The sea water churned, and the terrifying force stirred up the sea water within a radius of tens of thousands of meters.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
