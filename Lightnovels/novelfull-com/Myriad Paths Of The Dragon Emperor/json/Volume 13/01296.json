I wonder if he can succeed!</p><p>Gold one sighed, his eyes full of hope but also a little worry.</p><p>the last stage is the key. In history, there have been people who have reached this stage, but they all failed at the last step. If they can’t merge the five martial techniques of intent into one, it’s impossible to successfully cultivate the chaos intent.</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>this kid’s results are the best in history. I hope he can succeed!</p><p>A fiery red figure spoke.</p><p>“I hope so!”</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>……</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming had just gone up when he was blasted down.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not discouraged at all. He rushed up to the fighting ring again. The five puppets attacked at the same time. They fused five wills and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual senses were constantly scanning how the five puppets had integrated the five martial arts techniques of the five concepts. He was also constantly analyzing in his mind.</p><p>The power of the fusion of five martial arts techniques of intent was too strong. In less than two moves, Lu Ming was blasted out of the fighting ring and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not discouraged. He went up to the fighting ring and continued to fight, regardless of his injuries.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming could only block one or two moves. As time went on, the number of moves he could block increased and the time he could last grew longer.</p><p>After another half a year, Lu Ming could already withstand more than ten moves.</p><p>At this point, there were still nine months to go before the two years were up. However, Lu Ming had yet to comprehend the fusion of five martial arts techniques of creation.</p><p>Each of the five martial techniques had its own system. Each of them was a profound exploration of their own martial techniques. They were all unique. It was too difficult to merge them into one.</p><p>it seems that when I fused the five kinds of will before, I only had a superficial fusion. It was not a true and complete fusion. If it was a complete fusion, the five kinds of will would not be separated, but would become a new kind of will!</p><p>After this period of time, Lu Ming also understood that his so-called fusion of the five concepts in the past was only a superficial fusion. He was still a long way from a complete fusion.</p><p>the fusion of five martial techniques of intent realm still needs to start from the fusion of intent realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was analyzing all kinds of possibilities in his mind. He then went up to the fighting ring to verify his thoughts.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming’s five-colored conception surrounded him and he instantly used five kinds of conception martial arts techniques-flame, Thunder, and wind … It whistled through the fighting ring and blasted towards the five puppets.</p><p>However, under the fusion of the five martial arts techniques of the five puppets, the powerful attack instantly fell apart. It was completely outmatched.</p><p>It was like steel striking tofu.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming continuously struck out five types of martial arts techniques of creation, trying to merge them.</p><p>yes, this is the feeling. As long as we continue down this path, we will eventually succeed.</p><p>Although he still failed, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He finally felt that he had found the right direction.</p><p>As long as he found the right direction, he would eventually succeed.</p><p>The great battle continued. Half a month later, Lu Ming threw out a series of punches. This time, only four martial arts techniques of intent were unleashed. It was not that he was short of one, but that Lu Ming had successfully fused two of them.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve finally succeeded in the first step!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After such a long time, he had finally taken the first step.</p><p>If he fused two, then fusing three, four, or even five would be a matter of time.</p><p>“Continue, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was excited and continued to fight.</p><p>In the hall, Earth One, gold one, and the others were so excited that they almost jumped up.</p><p>he’s succeeded! He’s successfully fused two! He’s not far from success!</p><p>number one in history, number one in history! In the past, no one has ever been able to reach this stage. There’s hope!</p><p>hahaha, the inheritance of venerable sovereigns, is there finally a successor? ”</p><p>Gold one and the others laughed. They were extremely happy and excited.</p><p>In the beginning, it would be relatively easy to merge the two. However, it would become more and more difficult to merge the three, four, and five types.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had found the right direction. He had a clear goal. He was improving at every moment and was approaching his goal.</p><p>Time passed day by day, one month, one month.</p><p>It was getting closer and closer to the two years.</p><p>Lu Ming had also made a major breakthrough.</p><p>He had successfully fused three types and then four types. When there was still a month left until the two years were up, Lu Ming had finally successfully fused five types of martial arts techniques of creation into one martial arts technique of creation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Primal Chaos energy filled the air, and the terrifying power scattered the attacks of the five puppets, and the powerful energy continued to blast out.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The five puppets were sent flying by Lu Ming and fell outside the fighting ring.</p><p>Although the five puppets had also fused five martial arts techniques of creation, they were, after all, separated by five people. Lu Ming was alone, so the fusion was purer and the power was greater. Naturally, the combat power he unleashed was stronger.</p><p>hahaha, he succeeded, he succeeded!</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the rest roared excitedly. Then, their figures moved and they all disappeared from the hall. The next moment, the space on the battle stage where Lu Ming was at cracked open and earth One and the rest stepped out.</p><p>“Senior Earth One!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned when he saw Earth One. He then cupped his fists and saluted, looking at gold one and the rest.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, there’s no need to be so polite. Congratulations on passing all the levels and gaining the right to cultivate the chaos Scripture. Let me introduce you. This is gold one, Thunder one …</p><p>Earth One laughed heartily and was extremely excited. He introduced gold one and the rest to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets all the seniors!”</p><p>Although he knew that gold one and the rest were puppets, Lu Ming still bowed respectfully.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Once you’ve successfully cultivated the chaos Scripture, you’ll be the successor of the venerable sovereigns and our master!</p><p>Gold one laughed so hard that he could not close his mouth.</p><p>“Venerable sovereign?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming, let me make it clear to you. This is the chaos Hall of the primordial chaos sect. The hall Master is the chaos Thearch. The chaos Thearch is one of the most powerful experts in the primordial chaos sect. His combat strength is unparalleled and he dominates the world. He is the strongest expert in the world!</p><p>as long as you successfully cultivate the chaos Scripture, you’ll be the successor of the chaos Thearch. Naturally, you’ll also be our master!</p><p>Tu Yi explained.</p><p>“The primal Chaos Hall is part of the primordial chaos sect. Senior, may I know if there’s a space-time spiritual Hall in the primordial chaos sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“You know about the time and space spiritual Hall? The time and space spiritual Hall is one of the nine halls of Hunyuan sect. The hall Master of the time and space spiritual Hall is the time and space spiritual rat, one of the top ten war beasts. It is also a top expert in the world, but it is still slightly inferior to the chaos Supreme Emperor!”</p><p>Earth One explained. When he spoke of the chaos Thearch, his face was filled with pride.</p><p>the chaos Thearch is so powerful. He’s even stronger than the top ten warbeasts!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He was looking forward to the chaos Scripture even more.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
