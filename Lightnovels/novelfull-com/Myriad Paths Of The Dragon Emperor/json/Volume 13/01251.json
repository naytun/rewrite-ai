Spiritual sense spread out and seemed to form a void passage, but it was difficult to see with the naked eye.</p><p>here, each light door represents the entrance to a void passage. There will be various tests in these void passages.</p><p>furthermore, every two of these void passages can converge randomly. The point of convergence will be your battlefield, and only the winner can continue forward!</p><p>moreover, we can see the battle at the intersection point. So, you must perform to your heart’s content!</p><p>The white-haired old man explained.</p><p>“What an amazing screening method!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Each of the 500 people entered a void passage. After passing the round, there would be an opportunity for two void passages to converge. The two people in the converging void passages would fight. The winner would continue to pass the round, and the loser would be eliminated.</p><p>Until the strongest one was decided.</p><p>Moreover, the people of the tianshen sect could observe from the outside. Therefore, they could choose suitable disciples by observing the performance of the crowd.</p><p>“Alright. Now, all of you can randomly choose a light door and enter …”</p><p>The white-haired old man announced, but before he could finish his words, his expression suddenly changed and he looked up into the sky.</p><p>Nine ancient altars were floating in the sky.</p><p>Legend had it that in the distant past, the nine altars had been connected to the nine superpowers of the yuan continent. They were the space paths that connected the nine superpowers.</p><p>The Tian Shen sect had come from one of the ancient altars.</p><p>One of the other eight altars was glowing.</p><p>This scene shocked everyone.</p><p>The ancient altar glowed. Could it be that another big sect of the yuanlu continent was coming?</p><p>don’t tell me there are really other big sects coming over? Oh my God, it’s already a surprise that the tianshen sect could come.</p><p>not bad! This is a great opportunity!</p><p>Many people were discussing excitedly. Even the sovereigns were excited as they stared at the altar.</p><p>“What’s going on? Which force is it?”</p><p>Behind the white-haired old man, a burly man frowned and said.</p><p>The white-haired old man frowned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The altar trembled slightly, and many inscriptions glowed. The light grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>Finally, a few figures emerged from the altar.</p><p>There were a total of five people. Two of them were young men, and the other three were two middle-aged men and a middle-aged woman. However, it seemed that the middle-aged woman was the leader.</p><p>All five of them carried long swords on their backs and wore purple robes with strange patterns embroidered on them.</p><p>“Jiuxiao sword sect!”</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect changed his expression slightly.</p><p>it seems like I’m not late. I’ve finally arrived!</p><p>The middle-aged woman carrying a long sword said.</p><p>“Jiuxiao sword sect, what are you doing here?”</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect said coldly.</p><p>“Of course, I’m here to select young talents to join my jiuxiao sword sect. I don’t welcome you?”</p><p>The middle-aged woman smiled.</p><p>Hmph, the deity sect was the first to arrive at the continent group of the divine Ruins. All of this was also arranged by us!</p><p>The white-haired old man said coldly.</p><p>“You’re just one step ahead. Besides, how much energy would it take to set up these? The continent group of the divine Ruins does not belong to the tianshen sect alone. Naturally, our jiuxiao sword sect can also come!”</p><p>The middle-aged woman said indifferently.</p><p>On the side, the people from the continent of the divine Ruins group were extremely excited when they saw this scene.</p><p>Another big sect of the yuanlu continent had come to recruit disciples. This way, the probability of being selected would undoubtedly be higher.</p><p>The young men were especially overjoyed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, the altar above them began to tremble again, and it began to glow.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>it’s moving again. Could it be another big sect of the yuanlu continent? ”</p><p>“What’s going on? In the past, for countless years, there has never been a major sect that came to the continent group of the divine Ruins to select disciples. Why are there so many major sects coming this time?”</p><p>“This is a good thing, a good thing!”</p><p>The crowd discussed excitedly, but in the next moment, their pupils dilated sharply.</p><p>That was because, apart from that altar, there was another altar that was emitting light.</p><p>The people in the divine Ruins continent group were stunned.</p><p>There were many great sects in the yuanlu continent.</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect and the others looked extremely gloomy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two altars let out two light hums, and a few figures appeared on each of them.</p><p>On one of the altars, five figures appeared. They were all men, and they exuded a mighty pressure, as if they were the Kings of all beasts.</p><p>On the other side, six figures appeared. Each of them had monstrous demonic Qi and demonic might that shook the world.</p><p>Both sides had young men following them, curiously looking around.</p><p>Dragon God Valley, Tianyu demon sect!</p><p>The white-haired old man muttered, his eyes flashing with solemness.</p><p>hahaha, it seems that I’m not too late. The Tian Shen sect has not succeeded yet!</p><p>On the side full of the aura of the king of ten thousand beasts, a burly man laughed. They were people from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“It’s fine as long as you’re not late!”</p><p>One of the people from the Tian Yu demon sect, a tall and thin old man, spoke.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Dragon God Valley sect stepped out, forming a square with the people of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“It’s too cheap for you to come here now. Everything here was set up by us.”</p><p>The white-haired elder said.</p><p>it’s just a few arrangements. We’ll compensate you according to their value!</p><p>The middle-aged woman from jiuxiao sword sect said.</p><p>“That’s right, these are all trivial matters!”</p><p>The tall elder from the Tian Yu demon sect sneered.</p><p>In the end, the white-haired elder had no choice but to agree to the other three forces participating in the selection of disciples.</p><p>Because in the yuan continent, these three forces were not weaker than the tianshen sect. They were forces of the same level.</p><p>At the scene, more than 500 young powerhouses ‘eyes shone with a burning light. They were extremely excited.</p><p>The four major sects of the continent had come to recruit disciples. This was an unparalleled opportunity. They were full of anticipation and secretly vowed to grasp it.</p><p>alright, you can start now!</p><p>The white-haired elder looked at Lu Ming and the rest again.</p><p>let’s go. This is my chance. I must join a major sect in the yuanlu continent. In the future, I will break through the Emperor level and become a saint. I will step onto the peak!</p><p>“No one can stop me!”</p><p>The eyes of the paragons glowed as they charged toward the doors of light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>One by one, the elites rushed into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing, who nodded. The two of them flew towards a door of light.</p><p>“You, stop right there!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>It was young master Lin, a heaven’s favorite from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Young master Lin’s face was very gloomy. Originally, if there was only one deity sect, he had a way to prevent Lu Ming from joining the deity sect and then find an opportunity to kill Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
