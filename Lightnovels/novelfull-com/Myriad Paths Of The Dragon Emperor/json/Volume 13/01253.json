Release him!”</p><p>At that moment, a burly man from the heaven God sect spoke. He was the expert that Lu Ming suspected to have been bribed by young master Lin.</p><p>As he spoke, a terrifying aura bloomed and enveloped Lu Ming. It was as if Lu Ming was enveloped by a mountain, and he could not move at all.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong. Lu Ming felt that he had no way of resisting this middle-aged man.</p><p>This middle-aged man was definitely stronger than the black-robed middle-aged man from the South God Palace.

You’re an Emperor. Why are you interfering? ”</p><p>On the Dragon God Valley’s side, a burly man laughed. A stream of aura rushed out and collided with the middle-aged man’s aura, knocking it away. Lu Ming’s body relaxed, and he took a step back and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“You … What do you mean by that?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the tianshen sect looked at the people from the Dragon God Valley with a grave expression.</p><p>“Nothing, I just can’t stand it!”</p><p>The burly man from Dragon God Valley laughed.</p><p>“Let him go.
