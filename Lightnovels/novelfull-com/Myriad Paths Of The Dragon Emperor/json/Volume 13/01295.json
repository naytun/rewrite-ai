His third bloodline emerged and a surge of energy surged into his body, increasing his strength once again.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s strength increased, the khaki-colored puppet’s strength would increase as well.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming cast the prison suppressing heavenly art to increase its power. Correspondingly, the other party’s strength also increased rapidly.</p><p>It was useless. No matter how Lu Ming increased his strength, the other party would also increase his strength.</p><p>it’s indeed useless. In the end, we must use martial techniques of creation!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and put away his bloodline and dragon power. As expected, the other party’s strength had weakened as well. His basic strength was still at the same level as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Then I’ll fight with martial arts techniques of creation!”</p><p>Lu Ming only used his essential core and cast the earth Aeon technique to fight the other party.</p><p>Unfortunately, his opponent’s martial arts technique of creation was more powerful than Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming tried his best to resist, but he was still no match for his opponent. In less than ten moves, he was blasted off the fighting ring.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming got off the fighting ring, the other party stopped attacking.</p><p>this trial seems to be very difficult. Only one khaki-colored puppet has made a move. There are still four other puppets who haven’t made a move. I wonder if the other five puppets will join forces. If they join forces, the difficulty will be even more terrifying. No wonder it took two years!</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking quickly.</p><p>it seems that I can only pass this stage by quickly improving the level of my martial arts techniques. Then, let’s continue the battle!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He took a step forward and returned to the fighting ring.</p><p>The martial arts technique of creation that the other party used was exactly the same as his. The continuous battle would be of great help to Lu Ming’s understanding of the martial arts technique of creation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, it wasn’t the khaki-colored puppet that attacked. Instead, it was a fiery-red puppet that attacked. It used the fire elemental technique and was filled with an explosive attack.</p><p>Lu Ming also cast the fire elemental technique to fight it.</p><p>The other party’s fire elemental technique was obviously more powerful than Lu Ming’s. Even if Lu Ming tried his best, it would be difficult for him to resist.</p><p>how exquisite! So the fire elemental technique can be used in this way!</p><p>As he fought, Lu Ming sensed the fire elemental technique cast by the other party. At the same time, it matched with his own cultivation and increased his understanding of the fire elemental technique.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming was struck down from the fighting ring.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not discouraged. He went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>This time, it was a green puppet that attacked. The opponent used the wind elemental technique.</p><p>Just like that, once Lu Ming was knocked off the fighting ring, he would immediately go up and fight with his opponent. As he fought, he comprehended martial arts techniques of creation, making rapid progress.</p><p>Every time, he would only stop devouring the rough stones to replenish his essential core when Lu Ming’s essential core was exhausted.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time, and time flew by quickly.</p><p>One month, two months, three months …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.</p><p>In the past half a year, apart from recovering his essential core, Lu Ming had been fighting the five puppets. His understanding of the five martial arts techniques of creation had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Lu Ming had made major breakthroughs in all five types of martial arts techniques. He had entered the third stage and his power had increased greatly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used the earth Aeon technique to fight the khaki-colored puppet. Lu Ming’s fist force was powerful and heavy, and the earth concept was integrated into it. Every punch seemed to be suppressing the opponent with the earth. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>The two fists collided, and the khaki-colored puppet’s body was sent flying far away, falling at the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged toward the khaki-colored puppet.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, at that moment, a green figure flashed. The green puppet pounced at Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning. With a wave of its hand, the wind element technique cut open the space and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, a blazing aura filled the air and a fiery red figure pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, it was the blue puppet, and the purple puppet.</p><p>The khaki-colored puppets rose as well. The five puppets pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Indeed, as Lu Ming had guessed, the five puppets had joined forces.</p><p>The combined might of the five puppets was shocking. Lu Ming was forced to retreat continuously.</p><p>Most importantly, when Lu Ming cast one of the martial arts techniques of creation, he would be restrained by the corresponding puppet and would not be able to unleash his full power.</p><p>Lu Ming could only constantly change the martial arts techniques of creation, casting five types of martial arts techniques in turns to block the opponent’s attacks.</p><p>However, it took time for the five intents to rotate. Even if it was only for a moment, it was still a flaw. Lu Ming was forced to retreat continuously and was thrown off the fighting ring after a few moves.</p><p>the five puppets are too powerful and flawless when they join forces. I’m no match for them when I use only one martial technique of intent. If I can perfectly transform all five martial techniques of intent, there might be hope!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then went up to the fighting ring.</p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the fighting ring, the five puppets charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could only do his best to continuously switch between the five martial arts techniques of creation and fight the five puppets.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was no match for him at all. This was because there would always be gaps in the transition between the five martial arts techniques of creation. It was not perfect and the opponent would seize the opportunity to defeat him.</p><p>However, as time passed, Lu Ming became more and more skilled at switching between the five martial arts techniques of creation. A few months later, Lu Ming could easily switch between the five martial arts techniques of creation perfectly. He could cast any martial arts technique of creation with ease. He could even separate his left and right hands to cast different martial arts techniques of creation. At this point, Lu Ming had finally blocked the attacks of the five puppets.</p><p>“Fuse!”</p><p>However, at this moment, the khaki-colored puppet spoke indifferently. Then, the five puppets ‘figures changed and five martial arts techniques of intent were blasted out. They fused together and formed a chaotic color that blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The five martial arts techniques of creation were actually fused together, and their power increased crazily. With just one move, Lu Ming was sent flying out of the arena.</p><p>“No way! You can play like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in his heart.</p><p>The difficulty of this trial was simply too high. The techniques of the five puppets were becoming more and more powerful, and now, they were actually able to fuse five martial techniques of intent together?</p><p>Fusion? Right, fusion!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Could this be the prerequisite for cultivating chaos will?</p><p>Only by fusing five martial techniques of intent together would one be qualified to cultivate chaos intent?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but guess.</p><p>These checkpoints were not only tests, but also tempering.</p><p>Only those who could break through under such training could walk to the end and successfully cultivate the chaos will.</p><p>The chaos will was the king of the will between heaven and earth. It was absolutely terrifying. However, it was not hard to imagine that the difficulty of cultivating it was absolutely terrifying. The conditions for cultivating it were also extremely harsh.</p><p>Not everyone could successfully cultivate it.</p><p>Only when certain conditions were met would one be able to successfully cultivate it.</p><p>The tests along the way were probably to prepare for the cultivation of the chaos will. If he could not pass all the tests along the way, he would not be qualified to cultivate the chaos Scripture, nor would he be able to successfully cultivate the chaos will.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit again.</p><p>come on! I don’t believe that I can’t fuse five martial techniques of creation!</p><p>Lu Ming hollered and rushed up to the fighting ring to fight the five puppets.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
