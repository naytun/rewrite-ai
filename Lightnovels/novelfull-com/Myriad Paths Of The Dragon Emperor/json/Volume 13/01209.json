Lu Ming actually wanted him to leave behind his storage ring?</p><p>...</p><p>friend, don’t go too far. There are even stronger heaven’s favorites on the continent. If we go too far, it won’t do anyone any good!</p><p>The bald man said. The storage ring was all he had.</p><p>“Nonsense, if you don’t hand him over, leave him behind!”</p><p>Lu Ming rebuked and strode towards bald Lu Ming. His cold killing intent covered the bald man’s body, causing his bald head to break out in cold sweat.</p><p>“Puppet fighter, leave the ring!”</p><p>The other young man who fought evenly with the others from the continent spoke.</p><p>In the end, the bald young man had no choice but to take off his storage ring and throw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>After fighting evenly with one of the young men on the continent, the three of them left with their tails between their legs after leaving behind some harsh words.</p><p>“Tuoba, this ring is for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw the bald young man’s storage ring to Tuoba Shi.</p><p>“This … I can’t accept this!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi waved his hands frantically.</p><p>“No need to be so polite with me. This is compensation for your injuries!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Tuoba Shi was the last to put it away, and he was touched.</p><p>After that, they dug out the few pieces of Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines.</p><p>There were a total of five Divine Ruins ‘ancient mines. They were all the same-glistening yellow, like gold ore, but the material was not gold, and was hundreds of times more valuable than gold.</p><p>Of course, to them, even if it was tens of thousands of times more valuable than gold, it was of no use to them, unless it was a precious material for refining weapons. However, this kind of glistening yellow ore seemed to have no other use except for its unique sealing ability.</p><p>Little Qing, you have a reaction to this Divine Ruins ancient mine, indicating that it contains items that are useful to you. You keep it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and kept the five ancient mines.</p><p>Then, the few of them carefully surveyed the area and left after finding nothing else.</p><p>Following that, the three of them searched many places. Unfortunately, they did not discover any other Divine Ruins ancient mines.</p><p>You guys follow me, there might be a Divine Ruins ancient mine ahead!</p><p>Dandan ran forward madly. In front of her was a huge stone Forest, and at a glance, there were stone pillars.</p><p>Some of the stone pillars were as thick as a mountain peak, while others were as thin as a stick.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two followed dandan into the Stone Forest to sense it carefully.</p><p>Dandan’s pair of eyes swiveled around, and finally, she sensed something in a place. The few of them dug a large pit, and indeed, they discovered a few more Divine Ruins ancient mines.</p><p>this place is very magical. Let’s take a look again!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The group continued to venture deeper into the Stone Forest.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>With a boom, a huge explosion was heard. Then, the three of them saw the stone pillars in front of them explode one by one. Gravel flew everywhere as a figure flew over at high speed.</p><p>This figure had clearly been sent flying by someone and crashed into the stone pillars, which was why the stone pillars had exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the figure crashed into a stone pillar that was as large as a mountain not far away from Lu Ming and the rest. It only stopped after half of the stone pillar was destroyed.</p><p>“This is … Long Chen!”</p><p>The three men’s gazes froze and their hearts skipped a beat. This figure was actually Long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen spat out a mouthful of blood and saw Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Long Chen shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Their figures flickered as they arrived one after another, their powerful auras covering the entire Stone Forest.</p><p>Among these people, there were middle-aged men and white-haired old men. The aura they emitted was very shocking.</p><p>The worst was at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, some were at the ninth level, and some were even at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Long Chen, let’s see how you die today!”</p><p>An arrogant voice rang out.</p><p>The two young men stepped out.</p><p>“Mu Feng, mu Jue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>These two young figures were Mu Feng and mu Jue. The one who had just spoken was Mu Feng.</p><p>At that moment, Mu Feng and mu Jue turned their eyes and saw Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, it’s you guys. What a coincidence! I was planning to kill Long Chen before looking for you guys. I didn’t expect to meet you here. Haha, I’ll kill you guys as well. It saves me the trouble of looking for you!</p><p>Mujue laughed hysterically when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and could roughly guess what had happened.</p><p>It seemed like Mu Feng and mu Jue harbored a grudge against them and led experts to kill them in the divine Ruins.</p><p>The first person they encountered was long Chen. They planned to kill Long Chen before killing Lu Ming and the others, but they did not expect Lu Ming and the others to come here as well.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all!”</p><p>Mu Jue roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An elder appeared above Lu Ming and the other two. A vast aura burst forth and a huge fireball appeared in his palm. No, it was not a fireball, but a huge meteorite.</p><p>great circle of the spiritual God Realm! Not good! Retreat!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. This elder’s aura was too shocking. He was an existence at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, they frantically retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment they retreated, the meteorite crashed down at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At that moment, the eight streams of dragon energy in Lu Ming’s body erupted. His third bloodline emerged. In an instant, Lu Ming threw dozens of punches, each of which was powerful, hoping to weaken the meteorite’s power.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s demonic force field was also weakening the meteorite’s power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The meteorites fell and exploded, and the violent power spread out in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing retreated thousands of meters at top speed. They only stopped after they crashed through a dozen stone pillars.</p><p>“Little Qing, are you okay?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with concern.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head. She was surrounded by the sky demon force field, which weakened the power of the meteorite. It was not a big deal.</p><p>“Not good, Tuoba Shi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He did not see Tuoba Shi at the side.</p><p>Soon, the smoke and dust dissipated, and the scene in front of them became clear.</p><p>Tuoba Shi had also blocked the force, but he was sent flying in another direction. That direction was closer to mu Jue and the others.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Tuoba Shi stood up from the rubble with blood spurting from his mouth. Although he had managed to block the force, he was clearly injured.</p><p>“Tuoba, quickly leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Haha, we can’t escape!”</p><p>Mu Jue laughed heartily. In a flash, he pounced towards Tuoba Shi with lightning speed.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s cultivation base was two stages lower than mu Jue’s. In addition to his injuries, mu Jue grabbed his throat without any resistance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kneel down and beg me. Otherwise, I’ll kill your friend immediately!”</p><p>Mu Jue laughed and looked at Lu Ming smugly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave quickly. Don’t worry about me!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
