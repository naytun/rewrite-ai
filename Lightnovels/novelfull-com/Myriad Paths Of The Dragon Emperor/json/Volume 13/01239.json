I didn’t expect that my bloodline would appear immediately after I got it and swallow it. I could only start refining it. I didn’t expect that this cultivation would last seven days!</p><p>...</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. No wonder Xie nianqing had stayed in the hall for seven days.</p><p>“Little Qing, your cultivation …”</p><p>Lu Ming studied Xie nianqing carefully. He could feel that Xie nianqing’s true essence fluctuation was extremely strong.</p><p>after refining the demonic vitality pill, my cultivation has broken through from the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm to the seventh level spiritual God Realm in one go!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>seventh level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The seventh level of the spiritual God Realm was the pinnacle of all the geniuses present.</p><p>Xie nianqing was able to break through to the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. With his own combat strength, he had no worries about protecting himself.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>There was less than a day to go before the half-month deadline. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing went around. If they ran into anyone, Lu Ming did not mind killing them and snatching the key.</p><p>However, after flying for a while, they didn’t meet a single person.</p><p>Many of those with lower cultivations had gone into hiding during this period of time, and it was hard to find them.</p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the space trembled, and Lu Ming felt the space around him tighten. He disappeared from there, and the next moment, he appeared in the ancient city of the divine Ruins, on top of the thirty-six Phecda peaks.</p><p>Xie nianqing also appeared beside him.</p><p>Countless people were watching from all directions.</p><p>he’s out! The first round is over!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>In the sky above the 36 Tiangang peaks, people kept appearing and disappearing. Soon, more than 500 people appeared in the sky.</p><p>But after that, no one else appeared.</p><p>There were only five hundred people left!</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. Needless to say, the remaining people would definitely be left inside forever.</p><p>Out of nearly a thousand people, only five hundred came out. The death rate was close to half. Such a death rate was really too high.</p><p>It was shocking.</p><p>thunderbull, you lost an arm. Who has the strength to do that? ”</p><p>A voice rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and saw a young man with a ring on his nose. One of his arms was missing and his face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Many heaven’s favorites, including the sovereigns, also looked at the lightning bull.</p><p>“Lei Niu is one of the three most powerful experts of the Western deity Palace, but one of his arms was actually broken by someone. Who was it? Do you have such strength?”</p><p>“Could it be the strongest person from the other three divine palaces? Or the ones who are ranked second on the continent?”</p><p>he’s really powerful. The Thunder bull’s combat strength is already terrifying. I once saw him easily kill three great circle spiritual God existences. He could even contend with a Supreme-being for a while, but one of his arms was actually cut off!</p><p>The surroundings were filled with discussion and shock.</p><p>This made the lightning bull’s face even gloomier. He swept his gaze around and finally landed on Lu Ming. A cold killing intent flashed in his eyes. Then, he snorted coldly and walked towards the Western deity Palace.</p><p>The others glanced at each other and flew in four different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing came to the South God Palace.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s gaze swept across them, and his face turned gloomy.</p><p>The number of heaven’s favorites from the South God Palace had been reduced by half.</p><p>The losses were too great. One should know that as long as these heaven’s pride experts didn’t die, they would definitely become emperors in the future, and not ordinary emperors at that.</p><p>“So many people died!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also observing in secret.</p><p>Almost every continent had people dying in battle.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, Lu Ming saw Long Chen, Xie nianjun, yang potian, the heartless monk, the moonless Bodhisattva, and Ming Zi.</p><p>Like the three-headed hell hound, Kong Lin was no longer there. Clearly, he had already died in battle.</p><p>Including Lion City, the divine wilderness continent had lost three elites.</p><p>Such losses were considered small.</p><p>Some continents were almost completely extinct.</p><p>For example, the eighth-ranked genius, tie mainland, had lost 70% to 80% of his people. Even the second-ranked genius had died.</p><p>As for the Shen ‘e continent, it was even more miserable. Only two or three people were left, looking at each other.</p><p>As for the White Feather continent, they had also suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, two silhouettes in feather cloaks appeared on both sides of Lu Ming. Their cold killing intent enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The monk chanted the name of Buddha.</p><p>The rest of the people from the South God Palace also looked at the two young men in feather clothes.</p><p>Of the two young men, one was wearing a golden feather coat and the other was wearing a pair of black wings.</p><p>“Goldwing, godwing, what are you two doing?”</p><p>Ji hongchen furrowed his brows and asked.</p><p>he killed Silver Wing. Silver Wing left a special aura on him. Only the wings can feel it!</p><p>The young man in the Golden feather clothes said coldly.</p><p>“What? He killed Silver Wing?”</p><p>he actually managed to kill Silver Wing? ”</p><p>On the side of the South God Palace, many geniuses were puzzled.</p><p>Silver Wing was one of the top three heaven’s favorites of the White Feather continent. He had reached the 36 Phecda peaks and had a high cultivation level and powerful combat strength. How could this person from the divine wilderness continent kill him?</p><p>Ji hongchen frowned and did not continue to speak.</p><p>On the other hand, Wang Zhen and Xie nianjun were gloating.</p><p>that’s right. I killed Silver Wing!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>Since he had been discovered, there was nothing to hide.</p><p>how dare you kill the pride of the White Feather continent? tell me, what despicable method did you use to sneak attack? I don’t believe that a piece of trash from the divine wilderness continent like you can kill Silver Wing!</p><p>shut up! Golden Wing coldly rebuked.</p><p>“We’re all on the side of the South God Palace, but you actually fought among yourself and killed the geniuses of the White Feather continent to weaken the strength of the South God Palace. Also, who is your helper? Could it be someone from another divine wilderness continent!”</p><p>The Black-winged divine wing spoke as his cold gaze swept across the rest of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Xie nianjun, Ming Zi, yang potian, and the others ‘faces turned ugly.</p><p>“I have nothing to do with him. I have always been with young master Wang Zhen!”</p><p>Xie nianjun explained.</p><p>“Yes, I can testify that miss nianqing has nothing to do with this matter!”</p><p>Wang Zhen opened his mouth and explained.</p><p>“I also have nothing to do with him!”</p><p>“I have a grudge against him!”</p><p>Yang potian and Ming Zi spoke one after another, trying to draw a clear line between them and Lu Ming.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk and moonless Bodhisattva did not say anything.</p><p>Xie nianqing stood close to Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Long Chen took a step forward and stood beside Lu Ming. Xie nianjun, yang potian, and the others ‘faces changed. Long Chen was actually standing beside Lu Ming.</p><p>we don’t need anyone else to kill Silver Wing. We can kill him with a flip of our hands!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a calm expression, also, you guys need to be clear on one thing. Silver Wing was the one who wanted to kill me first. You guys don’t need to slander me for no reason. It’s useless!</p><p>nonsense. Don’t try to quibble. Since you’ve admitted that you killed Silver Wing,! life for! life. Now, kneel down and admit your crimes. Your accomplices are all guilty. Kneel down and destroy your cultivation. When the selection of disciples of the deity sect is over, I will take you back to the White Feather continent and sentence you!</p><p>Golden Wing announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
