I have some top-grade wine here that goes well with this roasted meat!”</p><p>...</p><p>The heartless monk walked over and with a wave of his hand, seven to eight jars of wine appeared on the ground.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Long Chen were all stunned.</p><p>How could there be such a monk in the Buddhist sect?</p><p>“Haha, then this little monk won’t be polite!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk laughed, and his eyes lit up. He rolled up his sleeves and tore off one of the bird’s wings, then began to gnaw.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and picked up a jar of wine. He opened it and took a big gulp. The wine was thick and sweet, and it felt warm and comfortable in his stomach. Even his vital essence could be circulated more smoothly.</p><p>This was truly a top-grade wine. This unscrupulous monk really knew how to enjoy himself.</p><p>Then, Li Huo gulped down the wine and ate the meat.</p><p>In two hours, seven or eight jars of wine were finished, and the two giant birds with level nine divine beast bloodline were only left with bones.</p><p>What made people even more stunned was that the unscrupulous monk didn’t even let go of the bones and began to gnaw on them.</p><p>this is a good thing. It’s a pity to miss it. You don’t have to be polite!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk mumbled as he stuffed the food into his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two looked at each other.</p><p>……</p><p>After another half an hour, the monk left reluctantly.</p><p>Little Qing, a million miles away from the ancient city of the divine Ruins, there’s a Thunder region. I plan on taking advantage of this half a month to go to the Thunder region to cultivate intent realm martial techniques!</p><p>Lu Ming told Xie nianqing his plan.</p><p>yes, I’m going to choose a martial arts technique of creation to practice. I’ll practice in the mountain and river diagram for the time being!</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing entered the mountain and river diagram. Xie nianqing sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>A chubby meatball flew over and rushed into Lu Ming’s arms, rubbing vigorously.</p><p>It was bubbles!</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had placed the bubbles in the mountain and river diagram. Now that he saw Lu Ming, the bubbles were very sticky.</p><p>“Little guy, I’ll bring you along!”</p><p>Lu Ming rubbed the bubbles and then exited the mountain and river diagram. He left the South deity Palace mansion and headed to the West of the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>The Thunder region was to the West of the ancient city of the divine Ruins.</p><p>……</p><p>In a room in the Western deity Palace, Lei Niu’s face was extremely gloomy. He looked at his empty arm and was even more furious. His killing intent was cold.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm could not regrow a broken arm. Only by breaking through to the martial Royal realm could one regrow an arm.</p><p>This wasn’t a big deal. Lei Niu was just worried that this selection by the deity sect would affect the views of the experts of the deity sect on him.</p><p>At this time, a black shadow flashed, and a thin-looking old Man in Black appeared in the room.</p><p>“Young master Niu, do you have any orders for me?”</p><p>The black-robed old man bowed and asked.</p><p>“Send a message back and ask my master to send some experts over. I’m going to find an opportunity to kill that brat!”</p><p>The lightning bull was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The black-robed old man bowed and accepted the order. Then, his figure moved and he left the place.</p><p>I need to find a place to recover. The Thunder region to the West of the ancient Divine Ruins city is a place where lightning congregates. It just so happens to be suitable for me!</p><p>The lightning bull muttered to itself.</p><p>……</p><p>To Lu Ming, the distance of a million miles was covered in a moment.</p><p>In front of him, black clouds covered the sky. The endless black clouds were rolling, and terrifying lightning bolts fell from the thunder and lightning, covering the entire sky like silver Snakes.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Thunder boomed, and all living things were dormant. This was a vast and boundless domain of lightning.</p><p>This was the Thunder region, known as the boundless Thunder region, because its scope was extremely vast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming paused for a moment before he stepped out and entered the lightning territory.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped into the lightning zone, nine bolts of lightning as thick as an arm shot toward him.</p><p>“Thunder God strike!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and condensed bolts of lightning out of thin air, negating the few bolts of lightning that struck him.</p><p>what a strong power of lightning! What a strong lightning concept!</p><p>Lu Ming extended his spiritual senses and felt the space around him. It was filled with extremely dense lightning energy.</p><p>this place is still too weak. Let’s continue deeper!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to venture deeper into the lightning territory.</p><p>Along the way, there were lightning bolts striking at Lu Ming but they were easily blocked by Lu Ming’s Thundergod strike.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also used the power of the lightning here to comprehend the Thundergod strike.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly. He could feel the lightning cauldron in his sea of consciousness shaking slightly. Then, the space between his brows glowed and the lightning cauldron appeared on its own.</p><p>The lightning cauldron trembled slightly and produced a powerful suction force. The surrounding lightning bolts were attracted by the lightning cauldron and flew into it, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>“This works too!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned for a moment, then he revealed a look of joy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming executed his movement technique and sprinted towards the depths of the lightning territory at top speed.</p><p>The deeper one went into the Thunder region, the stronger the power of the thunder and lightning would be. The strength of the Thunder mentality would also be stronger, and it would be easier to comprehend.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming also noticed a few auras. Clearly, there were other people cultivating here.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to a Valley. The power of lightning here was extremely strong. Endless lightning bolts rained down with a shocking aura.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the valley and sat cross-legged, quietly comprehending the power of lightning between heaven and earth and cultivating the Thundergod strike.</p><p>The lightning cauldron hovered above his head, occasionally absorbing a few huge bolts of lightning. Wisps of lightning swam around the body of the cauldron and sparkled.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Paopao lay lazily on Lu Ming’s body, squinting its eyes and sizing up the surroundings.</p><p>lightning is destruction. It is the punishment of the heavens!</p><p>Lu Ming carefully comprehended and muttered.</p><p>He was experiencing the essence of the power of lightning.</p><p>The power of thunder and lightning was the power of divine punishment. It feared everything and its power was extremely terrifying. However, it was also extremely difficult to comprehend its essence.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had only used it roughly and did not explore it in depth.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating in the valley for three days.</p><p>He had learned a lot in the past three days. He was very close to the second level of Thundergod strike and could break through at any time.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming felt that the lightning in the valley was not powerful enough. He needed stronger lightning power to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked out of the valley, continuing to venture deeper.</p><p>Two hours later, Lu Ming arrived in front of a majestic mountain. In the sky above the mountain, there were endless lightning and thunder. The power of the lightning was extremely rich.</p><p>However, Lu Ming sensed that many cave abodes had been opened up in the mountains, and there were auras entrenched there. It was obvious that experts were cultivating there.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and was about to turn around and leave. He did not want to stay any longer.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightning shot out from the mountain. An elder in green appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>At the same time, he stared at the lightning cauldron above Lu Ming’s head with a burning gaze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
