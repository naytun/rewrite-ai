Terrifying forces swept in all directions, spreading out casually, cutting open the space and destroying the earth.</p><p>In the distance, the one-eyed man’s face was pale and his body was trembling.</p><p>“Supreme dark lightning will definitely be able to kill this brat! He still has a bloodline he hasn’t used yet! Once he does, this brat will definitely die!”</p><p>The one-eyed man prayed in his heart, but he did not leave. He wanted to see Dark Thunder Supreme kill Lu Ming before he could feel at ease.</p><p>Lu Ming and dark Thunder Supreme exchanged hundreds of moves, but neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>your bloodline power is about to be used up, but my bloodline is still useless. Let’s see how you die!</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder’s cold voice rang out.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s faint voice was heard. At that moment, the light of the nine Dragon bloodline dimmed. The power of the nine Dragon bloodline was almost exhausted.</p><p>However, before dark Thunder Supreme could rejoice, a stone tablet rushed out from the bloodline of the nine Dragons. The stone tablet rapidly enlarged, and the words on it shone with a brilliant light. Like an ancient divine mountain, it pressed down on Dark Thunder Supreme with an all-suppressing force.</p><p>“This … That’s impossible!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder roared in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had two types of divine level bloodlines. Furthermore, their levels were so high.</p><p>Although the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was only at the eighth level of the divine level, the aura it emitted was extremely terrifying, Shocking Dark lightning Supreme.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison suppressing stele’s bloodline clashed with dark lightning Supreme, and the terrifying suppressive force caused him to stagger back.</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme was actually at a disadvantage. This made the one-eyed man, who was watching the battle from a distance, almost bite his tongue, and his body was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>A martial artist at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm was actually able to suppress a Supreme-being with his own combat power. This was simply like a fantasy that he had never heard of.</p><p>He thought he was dreaming!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled, and the light became even brighter. The word on the stele seemed to have a magical power. A mysterious power was activated by Lu Ming, and it emitted an aura that could suppress thousands of worlds. It was so oppressive that even dark Thunder Supreme’s heart was trembling.</p><p>At this moment, he unleashed his bloodline power without any hesitation.</p><p>His bloodline was a hammer with Black Lightning and six golden chakra. It was a divine level rank 6 bloodline.</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme turned into a beam of light and rushed into the hammer. The hammer rapidly grew in size, becoming as big as the prison suppressing stele bloodline. Black Lightning surrounded it, and it blasted towards the prison suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A dull sound rang out, as if the stars had shifted, and the world shook.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and was sent flying.</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme’s battle-power had indeed increased by a large margin after using bloodline fusion.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The huge thunder hammer, like the hammer of the primordial God of Thunder, brought with it thousands of Thunderbolts and smashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming, the lightning cauldron floating in the air trembled slightly. Thousands of lightning bolts exploded, turning into the laughter of a mountain that crashed toward the huge hammer.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>There was another muffled bang. This time, they were evenly matched.</p><p>The lightning cauldron and the giant hammer both retreated, but the Furious and shocked roar of Dark Thunder Supreme rang out from the lightning Hammer.”What the hell is this?”</p><p>The lightning cauldron had actually absorbed some of the black Lightning from the hammer during the collision.</p><p>This lightning was the essence of Dark Thunder Supreme’s bloodline. If it was absorbed, it would have a great impact on his future cultivation. It would even reduce his chances of breaking through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline and the lightning cauldron shot toward dark lightning Supreme.</p><p>Two more booms rang out. This time, the giant hammer formed by Dark Thunder sovereign was knocked flying, and some of the lightning from it was absorbed by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After absorbing dark lightning Supreme’s lightning, the lightning cauldron seemed to be very excited. It trembled slightly, and Lu Ming could feel its excitement.</p><p>“Then let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron and continued to bombard the giant hammer.</p><p>This time, a large amount of Black Lightning was absorbed by the lightning cauldron. Dark lightning sovereign let out an angry roar, and in the end, he couldn’t maintain the shape of his bloodline and dissipated.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll remember this!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder transformed into a Thunderbolt and fled. He transformed into a bolt of lightning, piercing through the void and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A Supreme-being was sent running away by Lu Ming, a seventh level spiritual God Realm youth. If this were to spread, no one would believe it.</p><p>Supremes were synonymous with invincibility when emperors weren’t present. They were known as Supreme Venerables who had comprehended the embryonic form of a domain and could be called half-step emperors. They were much stronger than ordinary great circle spiritual gods.</p><p>But now, he was beaten away by a youth in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. He was beaten until he could only run for his life. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed it.</p><p>Even though he had seen it with his own eyes, it still felt like a dream. At this moment, the one-eyed man seemed to be in a dream. His eyes were wide open, and he only reacted after a long time. He immediately turned around and ran away in fear.</p><p>“You’re quite fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction that Dark Thunder Supreme had fled in and secretly felt that it was a pity.</p><p>He didn’t give chase. The speed of a Supreme martial artist was too fast, and they could tear through space. Even if he gave chase, he wouldn’t be able to catch up.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>On his shoulder, the chubby Bubble chirped and waved its little claws. The bubbles on its nose, one big and one small, followed its breath.</p><p>“Are you saying that if you help him, he won’t be able to escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming tried to guess what bubbles meant.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles nodded and waved her claws.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll ask for your help next time!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched the bubble’s round body. Then, he looked in the direction where the one-eyed man had left. He sneered.”You dare to scheme against me, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and turned into a stream of light, chasing after the one-eyed man.</p><p>Not long after, a blood-curdling scream was heard. The one-eyed man was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing the one-eyed man, Lu Ming returned to the vicinity of the small hill. He looked at the Thunder Phoenix Tree inside but did not enter immediately.</p><p>The lightning around the Thunder Phoenix Tree was too strong. It was extremely terrifying and filled with destructive power.</p><p>Furthermore, Dark Thunder Supreme was standing guard in the vicinity, yet he didn’t enter to take away the Thunder Phoenix Tree. This showed that the Thunder Phoenix Tree was definitely extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Let’s try it first!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming decided to give it a try.</p><p>Since he had come here and encountered the Thunder Phoenix Tree, there was no reason for him to retreat. He would not be satisfied if he did not give it a try.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron to float above his head. He stepped into the area with a radius of a hundred miles around the small hill.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As soon as he stepped into that area, the sky and earth rumbled and endless lightning struck wildly at Lu Ming.</p><p>That kind of power was countless times more terrifying than Lu Ming’s heavenly lightning tribulation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, at this moment, the lightning cauldron trembled as if it was very excited. A powerful suction force erupted and absorbed the power of the lightning in an instant. Lu Ming was safe and sound.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
