However, this pair of lovers had been arranged to fight each other.</p><p>Everyone was very curious. What would be the outcome of the two?</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming touched his nose, feeling rather helpless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you want to admit defeat?”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled cheekily and squinted his big eyes, revealing a sly look.</p><p>“I admit defeat? Sure, but …”</p><p>As Lu Ming spoke, he looked at Bing Kong and the rest at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>In a battle with Xie nianqing, it didn’t matter whether he won or lost. If Xie nianqing wanted him to admit defeat, he would. He was worried that if Xie nianqing won, he would have to face Bing Kong and the others.</p><p>With Xie nianqing’s current cultivation, he was no match for Bing Kong and the others.</p><p>hehe, silly, I’m just joking with you. I can’t deal with those guys, so I’ll leave them to you. You have to get first place, or I won’t let you off!</p><p>Xie nianqing laughed, then looked around and said, ” “I admit defeat!”</p><p>Xie nianqing admitted defeat. The space twisted, and Xie nianqing was teleported out.</p><p>Lu Ming was teleported to the platform at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>Everyone was speechless. Lu Ming had won too easily.</p><p>There were a total of five people on the platform below the stairs.</p><p>Lu Ming, Eden, Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji.</p><p>The five strongest paragons of the divine Ruins ‘continent group had been born.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the five of them.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired elder of the heaven God sect stepped out and his voice spread throughout the entire place, next, the final battle will begin. It’s very simple. All of you will climb the stairs. The first person to do so will be first, the second will be second, and so on!</p><p>“On the stairs, you can use any method!”</p><p>As soon as the white-haired old man finished speaking, Bing Kong, Eden, and the others ‘eyes lit up. They sized each other up and were on guard.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, the five of them stepped forward at the same time, heading up the stairs.</p><p>As he stepped down, the stairs rumbled, as if a mountain had landed on the stairs.</p><p>“What a strong pressure!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped onto the stairs, he felt an immense pressure on his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This flight of stairs was indeed not that simple.</p><p>Standing on the first step, the five of them were on guard against each other, preventing each other from attacking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what right do you have to be with us? get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, Bing Kong’s cold gaze was directed at Lu Ming as he berated him coldly.</p><p>When the Ice Dragon was defeated by Lu Ming back then, he had always harbored a grudge in his heart. He had secretly begged Bing Kong to take revenge for him when he had the chance. At that moment, Bing Kong immediately made his move.</p><p>Moreover, the five people on the field-Eden, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji-were the strongest heaven’s favorites of the four corners divine Palace. They were on par with him. As for Lu Ming, what was he? How could they stand together with them and compete with them?</p><p>He wanted to blast Lu Ming down first.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He threw an icy palm at Lu Ming. The icy cold air seemed to be about to freeze Lu Ming’s blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he struck out with his palm, clashing with Bing Kong’s palm force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bing Kong’s body swayed slightly and he took a step back. Lu Ming’s body did not move, but a cold current flowed along Lu Ming’s arm and seeped into it.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked it with his five-colored concept. A layer of white frost covered his arm and crackling sounds could be heard.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming circulated his essential core and shook it violently, dispersing the cold air.</p><p>“What a terrifying cold Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the cold air was several times stronger than the Ice Dragon. In a battle of the same level, the Ice Dragon was no match for Bing Kong. Moreover, Bing Kong’s cultivation was higher.</p><p>“You have some strength. Let’s see how many moves you can take!”</p><p>Bing Kong’s eyes darkened and his aura became even colder.</p><p>“Extreme Ice seal!”</p><p>The icy palm continued to strike at Lu Ming. The extremely cold palm energy was aimed at Lu Ming. The entire space was frozen wherever the palm energy passed. Everything in the space was frozen.</p><p>The martial technique of creation and its maturity were definitely not at the third level. It should have reached the fourth level.</p><p>On the side, Eden, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji all had grave expressions.</p><p>The Dragon energy roared in Lu Ming’s body. The nine streams of dragon energy burst out completely. At the same time, the third bloodline emerged. The blood-red energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, and a terrifying killing intent rushed towards the ice.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and punched out with both fists.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The terrifying cold air turned the entire staircase snow-white. Eden, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji retreated as they released their Zhen Yuan to block the cold air.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bing Kong exchanged nine moves in a row. In the end, Lu Ming broke through Bing Kong’s palm force and attacked him.</p><p>“If you want me to go down first, then I’ll let you go first!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, his aura soaring. With the prison-suppressing heavenly art in his left hand and lightning flashing in his right hand, he cast the Thundergod strike.</p><p>The lightning Phoenix danced in the air as it pounced towards the ice. At the same time, the prison suppressing heaven art also suppressed the ice.</p><p>Bing Kong’s face was dark and his cultivation was pushed to the extreme.</p><p>The middle stage of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm was slightly higher than Zi Wuji’s and Jian Zhan’s. His true essence was as vast as the ocean. Combined with martial techniques of intent, the power was even more terrifying.</p><p>“Absolute zero, ice-sealing world!”</p><p>Bing Kong’s Black hair turned snow-white and carried a terrifying cold current. He launched a storm-like attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought fiercely and exchanged dozens of moves in a row. However, Lu Ming still had the upper hand.</p><p>At the moment, there were nine streams of dragon energy in Lu Ming’s body. When they burst out, they were extremely powerful, just like long Chen. Even if his cultivation level was not high enough, he could make up for it.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through the endless cold currents and continued to attack the ice.</p><p>In the end, Bing Kong was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s punch. Blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to step forward and punch the air, constantly blasting the ice.</p><p>Bing Kong was completely outmatched and was suppressed by Lu Ming. His body shook violently and he finally retreated down the stairs and landed on the platform below.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength is so strong. Even Bing Kong is being suppressed by him!</p><p>he’s indeed powerful. He’s only at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, a full level behind Bing Kong, but he managed to defeat someone stronger than him. He’s really powerful. It seems that he was delayed by something when he was clearing the trial. Otherwise, with his combat strength, he would not be so slow!</p><p>“That’s right, we’ve underestimated him!”</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming was the tenth person to succeed, he took more than two hours. Many people thought that Lu Ming’s combat strength was not strong and that he might have used some secret skill to fight with young master Lin.</p><p>Now, it seemed that it was not the case at all. Lu Ming’s combat strength was extremely shocking. He was stronger than they had imagined.</p><p>Even Bing Kong, who had reached the middle stage of the ninth level spiritual God Realm, was suppressed by Lu Ming. Such combat strength was truly shocking.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Bing Kong let out an angry roar. The bloodline appeared above his head. It was an Ice River that emitted an icy aura.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
