The power of the fourth level was already very amazing.</p><p>His dragon claws were covered in lightning. When he stepped out, the sky was filled with lightning.</p><p>“Nine strikes of the iron sword!”</p><p>An iron sword streaked across the sky, cutting through the space and slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“East-rising purple Qi!”</p><p>The sky was filled with purple light. A purple spear, extremely sharp, was aimed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Ice Aeon!”</p><p>An Ice River made of cold air swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Phoenix dance!”</p><p>A zither appeared above Eden’s head. A Phoenix pattern was carved on the zither. This was Eden’s bloodline, the Phoenix zither.</p><p>The Phoenix zither and the ancient zither in Eden’s hands merged into one. Sonorous zither notes burst out. This time, seven phoenixes flew out at the same time toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The four strongest paragons attacked at the same time, unleashing their strongest attack that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heavens, he’s too strong!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is definitely no match for him. He’s going to be defeated!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>But even more people had their eyes wide open as they stared at the stairs. They didn’t even blink and even forgot to breathe.</p><p>They didn’t dare to blink as they were afraid that the moment they did, the situation would change. They stared at the battle intently.</p><p>“Lu Ming, can you block it?”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing clenched her fists tightly. She was extremely nervous.</p><p>lose, quickly lose. It’s best if you’re killed by this attack. You’d better be annihilated!</p><p>Those who had a grudge against Lu Ming, such as Ice Dragon, Wang Zhen, Xie nianjun, and young master Lin, were praying silently.</p><p>“Look, Lu Ming can’t hold on any longer. His Blood Meridian is collapsing!”</p><p>“It’s true, he’s finished!”</p><p>Lu Ming is too high-profile. He’s fighting the top four alone. He’s doomed to lose!</p><p>Exclamations of shock could be heard.</p><p>At this time, under the joint attack of the four strongest heaven’s favorites, the nine Dragon bloodline collapsed inch by inch. It seemed to be unable to withstand it and dissipated into light.</p><p>The crowd saw Lu Ming’s body in the light from the collapse of the nine Dragon bloodline. However, in the next moment, Lu Ming’s body was drowned in endless light and the attacks of the four powerful experts.</p><p>Lu Ming was dead for sure!</p><p>Many people thought to themselves.</p><p>His Blood Meridian had collapsed. How could Lu Ming withstand such an attack?</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>At this critical moment, Eden pressed his hands on the zither and forced the seven phoenixes back. However, Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and Zi Wuji didn’t stop their attacks. Instead, they became even more violent.</p><p>Lu Ming was too strong and they were jealous of him. They wanted to take this opportunity to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>A huge stone tablet rushed out of the light, emitting a bright light. It quickly became the size of a mountain.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice came from the stone tablet. The words on the stone tablet shone with a brilliant light. With a shake, all the attacks were destroyed.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all stunned and only reacted after a long time.</p><p>another bloodline, a divine level rank 8 bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming actually has two types of blood vessels. One is divine level level eight and the other is divine level nine. How is that possible? ”</p><p>“And what’s with his eighth ranked divine bloodline? How could he be so powerful? It can destroy the attacks of Bing Kong and the others in one fell swoop.”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>At first, they thought that Lu Ming would be killed by this attack. However, at the critical moment, Lu Ming actually burst out another kind of Blood Meridian and blocked the attacks of several powerful experts. It left them dumbfounded.</p><p>the prison-guarding stele! This is the bloodline of the prison-guarding stele!</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>it really is the bloodline of the prison-guarding stele. One is the nine Dragons, and the other is the legendary prison-guarding stele. It’s incredible!</p><p>“The legendary nine heaven suppressing steles!”</p><p>The experts from Dragon God Valley, jiuxiao sword sect, and Tianyu demon sect all exclaimed in shock.</p><p>It was as if seeing the prison-suppressing stele bloodline was more shocking than seeing the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>As Lu Ming’s voice rang out, the prison-suppressing stele trembled and pressed down on the icy sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge prison-suppressing stele pressed down on the ice River, causing a scream to come out of the ice River.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>There was a layer of blood-red light on the prison-suppressing stele, which was the power of the third bloodline. Lu Ming had borrowed more power from the third bloodline to make the power of the prison-suppressing stele even stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed down again and hit the ice River. This time, the ice River shook violently and collapsed, turning into energy and dissipating. Bing Kong’s figure appeared, blood spurting out of his mouth. He flew far away and hit the platform below the stairs, spitting out a few more mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>This change was too sudden. From the appearance of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline to its fierce attack on Bing Kong, it had only taken a breath’s time to severely injure him.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At this moment, in the sword battle, Zi Wuji attacked at the same time. His iron sword and long spear were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and directly hit the iron sword and the long spear.</p><p>The part below the bloodline was the original body of the prison-suppressing stele, which was indestructible. The iron sword and the spear hit the stele with only two clangs before they were flicked away by the bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele suppressed the two of them. With two loud bangs, the two of them were forced to retreat.</p><p>Up until now, in the sword battle, Zi Wuji and the others had used up a lot of their bloodline power. Lu Ming had just used the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and his bloodline power was still abundant. He kept attacking the two of them.</p><p>Eden didn’t do anything during this process.</p><p>In the sword battle, Zi Wuji and Lu Ming could not withstand many moves. Their blood vessels were also destroyed by Lu Ming, and their bodies were sent flying while vomiting blood.</p><p>The three powerhouses were all injured by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the prison-suppressing stele and continued to suppress the ice.</p><p>Bing Kong’s eyes flashed with fear as he shouted, ” “I admit defeat!”</p><p>Then, the space flashed, and Bing Kong was teleported out.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly and aimed the prison-suppressing stele at Jian Zhan and Zi Wuji. The two of them were helpless. Now that their Blood Meridian power had been exhausted, they were no match for Lu Ming and could only admit defeat.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Eden were left on the stairs.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk and transformed into Lu Ming’s appearance.</p><p>“Do you still want to continue?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Eden.</p><p>Just now, Eden had withdrawn its attack at the critical moment. This made Lu Ming’s impression of him improve slightly. He did not launch an attack.</p><p>“Is there still a need? I’m not your match!”</p><p>Eden forced a smile and shook his head. He put away his zither and stepped out of the staircase, appearing in the void outside.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming was the only one left on the stairs.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was the center of attention.</p><p>There was no doubt about the assessment this time. Lu Ming was in first place.</p><p>This result was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming had single-handedly fought four of the strongest geniuses. If anyone had said this before, no one would have believed it. They would definitely have been called a lunatic.</p><p>Even now, some people were still in a daze and felt that this was very unreal.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
