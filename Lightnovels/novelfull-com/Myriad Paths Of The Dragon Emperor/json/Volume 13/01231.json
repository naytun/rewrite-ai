However, he suddenly saw that Silver wing’s claw was injured by Lu Ming’s punch and it was forced to retreat.</p><p>He was a little stunned. In his imagination, this was not the case at all. He was still worried that Lu Ming would be killed by Silver Wing in two moves and was silently praying that Lu Ming would be able to Dodge and withstand a few moves. He had never expected that it would actually be such a scene.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his killing intent extremely strong.</p><p>Enveloped by Lu Ming’s killing intent, Silver wing’s entire body turned cold and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Didn’t you want to kill me? why are you retreating now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and caught up with the silver Wing in an instant. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>The power of this palm made Silver wing’s hair stand on end and his muscles tremble in fear.</p><p>“Gah!”</p><p>With a sharp cry, Silver Wing transformed into a big silver Bird, emitting silver light all over his body.</p><p>It turned out that Silver Wing wasn’t a human, but a demon. This was his true form.</p><p>He transformed into his original form and folded his Silver Wings to block in front of him in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck down and destroyed the silver wing’s protective demonic energy. His palm hit the silver wing’s wings and with a clang, the wings exploded. Silver feathers flew all over the sky.</p><p>arghh! Silver Wing screamed and retreated like a mad man. He was like a silver lightning.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. The power of each step was stronger than the previous one. The power of each step landed on Silver wing’s body.</p><p>With every step, Silver wing’s body trembled violently. When Lu Ming took the eighth step, Silver Wing let out a shrill scream and its body was torn to pieces.</p><p>Silver blood scattered in the air.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>On the other side, man Feng was dumbfounded and dumbfounded. Then, he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>It was too shocking. Silver wing’s combat strength was about the same as his, but he was killed by Lu Ming in a few moves. This was too terrifying.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>The first thing that flashed through his mind was this sentence. Then, he turned and ran.</p><p>“Didn’t you want my key? Why is he running away now?”</p><p>A cold voice sounded in man Feng’s ears.</p><p>you’re courting death! man Feng roared in fear. He exploded with all his strength and threw a punch at Lu Ming, but what greeted him was Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two fists collided. Man Feng felt a sharp pain in his arm. The bones in his hand were broken by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s attacks were like a storm. The shadows of his fists were like mountains, enveloping the brutal wind.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Man Feng roared, but in the next moment, he was drowned. Then, with a scream, man Feng was killed.</p><p>The two top powerhouses who could ascend the 36 Phecda peaks were killed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“What … How did this happen?”</p><p>Not far away, the paragons of the White Feather continent and the yellow mang continent watched this scene in shock, their mouths agape.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Especially mujue, he couldn’t stop mumbling. He couldn’t accept what was happening.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was very strong. He had long known that Lu Ming had killed so many experts in the divine Ruins. Even a perfected spiritual God was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>However, the geniuses who were able to ascend the 36 Phecda peaks all had combat strength that could suppress those in the great circle of the spiritual God stage. They could even kill those in the great circle of the spiritual God stage. Their combat strength was extremely close to that of a Supreme-being and were definitely above Lu Ming’s back then.</p><p>He had thought that Silver Wing would be able to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>But now? Lu Ming played it down. He casually slashed Silver Wing and brutal wind in succession without even activating his Blood Meridian. This kind of combat strength was too shocking and terrifying.</p><p>“Mujue, it’s your turn now!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked at mu Jue.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>Mujue almost peed his pants in fear. He screamed and ran back frantically.</p><p>The others also dispersed in an uproar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was like lightning as he rushed towards mu Jue.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me, help! Help me!”</p><p>Mujue shouted madly, he didn’t have the courage to resist.</p><p>“Didn’t you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, I beg you, let me go!”</p><p>Mujue was about to cry.</p><p>Back then in the divine Ruins, why didn’t you consider letting me off? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His killing intent was extremely cold. He had to kill mu Jue.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’m the young master of the MU family. My father is the master of the MU family, a King. If you kill me, no one can save you. You’re dead too!</p><p>Mu Jue shouted. Seeing that begging for mercy wasn’t going to work, he began to threaten.</p><p>“That’s my business, you don’t have to worry about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, unmoved.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Mujue trembled in fear and only knew to scream.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with mu Jue. He struck with his palm and mu Jue was killed without any resistance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the light above Lu Ming’s head was even more dazzling. The blood-red light pillar was even more brilliant.</p><p>That was because there were a total of nine blood-colored keys floating above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Why are there only nine?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>Earlier, he had killed Silver Wing and brutal wind. Logically speaking, he should have obtained more than Ten Keys from them. However, there were only nine keys above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“It seems that I can only get nine at a time. Any more than that would be a waste!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Let’s open the palace first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the palace.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end as he sensed danger approaching him rapidly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, a sword-light descended from the sky and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Before the sword gleam arrived, a terrifying chill descended, as if it was going to freeze Lu Ming completely.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming threw a punch at the sword gleam.</p><p>With a bang, the sword light exploded and turned into ice fragments that scattered in all directions. This was an ice sword.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he took three consecutive steps back.</p><p>“So cold, such a terrifying cold Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his fist was a little numb. He lowered his head and saw that a layer of ice crystals had formed on his fist.</p><p>His fist was covered with five different concepts of heaven and earth, as well as the essential core. Under his skin, there was also the Dragon power due to the explosion. However, the cold air had actually passed through his multiple defenses and was about to freeze Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen such a cold air before.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky and saw a young man in white, walking toward him.</p><p>Five keys were floating above the man’s head.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This person was one of the four most powerful geniuses of the North deity Palace. He was on par with Ji hongchen, Wang Zhen, and the others.</p><p>“Ice Dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming murmured. The black-robed man had specially compiled a list of the most terrifying geniuses of the four divine palaces and the top-ranked continents. Lu Ming had seen them before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
