Lu Ming hasn’t appeared yet. What’s going on? ”</p><p>“Could he have died inside?”</p><p>it can’t be. If Lu Ming died inside, the experts of the heavenly God sect would definitely know. Now that the experts of the heavenly God sect have not said anything, it means that Lu Ming is not dead!</p><p>“Then why do you need so long?”</p><p>It had been a long time. Even those who had high hopes for Lu Ming were wavering.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had won against young master Lin. This made some people think highly of him. They felt that even if Lu Ming could not get first place, he would most likely be in the top three.</p><p>But now, many people were wavering.</p><p>Some people even guessed that Lu Ming might have used some kind of secret skill in his battle with young master Lin, which increased his combat strength in a short period of time. However, there were huge aftereffects. At this moment, his combat strength was probably not enough and he was struggling to hold on.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people accepted this view.</p><p>Lu Ming was unaware of all this. He was still in the void channel, resisting the attacks from all directions.</p><p>Right now, he was continuously weakening the power of the prison subduing heaven technique, mainly using his intent to resist and train his intent. As time passed, his comprehension of the water intent became stronger and stronger, and the feeling of a breakthrough also became stronger.</p><p>A few hours passed. Suddenly, the blue light from the five-colored concept that surrounded Lu Ming’s body suddenly brightened.</p><p>The blue light represented the concept of water.</p><p>His water concept had broken through and reached the full circle of level four.</p><p>Now, he was only left with the earth will, which had not reached the completion of level four.</p><p>If his earth concept had also broken through to the great circle of the fourth level, Lu Ming would only need to find time to continuously devour and refine the rough stones. His cultivation would continue to break through until he reached the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that easy to reach the Supreme level. One had to transform their intent into a domain.</p><p>The breakthrough in the water concept had slightly increased Lu Ming’s combat strength. Although it was not by much, it was better than nothing.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and pressed his palm down. With the support of the five-colored concept, the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique skyrocketed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a prison-suppressing stele, suppressing the heavens.</p><p>All around, the figures and the attack power formed by the formation were destroyed one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was getting faster and faster. There was no way to stop him.</p><p>In less than three minutes, Lu Ming had covered a distance of more than ten miles. There was a platform in front of him and Lu Ming stepped onto it.</p><p>he passed. It’s Lu Ming. He passed!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, there was a clamor all around.</p><p>“It took me more than two hours to clear it, hehe!”</p><p>Some people sneered and scoffed.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>When Lu Ming’s figure appeared, the light spots that appeared in the first and second stages dispersed one by one like bubbles.</p><p>In the end, only ten people passed this round.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped onto the platform, he saw Xie nianqing, Long Chen, Eden, Bing Kong, and the others.</p><p>He and Xie nianqing looked at each other and smiled tacitly. Then, they nodded to Long Chen.</p><p>Eden, Bing Kong, Jian Zhan, and the others also looked at Lu Ming one by one. Some were solemn, some were contemptuous, and there were many others.</p><p>In the air, the ten of them formed a circle and floated in the air, looking at each other.</p><p>At this moment, a light spot floated out from the center of the 10 people. Slowly, a fighting ring condensed and floated in the center of the 10 people.</p><p>It seemed that the battle between the ten of them was about to begin on this battle platform.</p><p>Suddenly, two of the platforms flew toward the fighting ring.</p><p>“Eden and tiehong!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart skipped a beat. The two people flying towards the fighting ring were Eden and tie Hong.</p><p>After the two of them flew to the fighting ring, the platform under their feet automatically disappeared. The two of them automatically landed on the fighting ring and stood opposite each other.</p><p>It seemed that the duels were random. Whichever two people flew to the fighting ring would fight.</p><p>“Eden, let’s fight!”</p><p>Tie Hong’s eyes were filled with battle intent. His muscles and skin were like divine metal, emitting a cold light.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Eden opened his mouth. It was very simple. He clenched his fist in the air, and his vital essence condensed into a nine-string zither.</p><p>“You’re not going to use a real spirit weapon?”</p><p>Tie Hong’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“I’ll use it when I need it!” Eden said. His voice was calm, but it revealed his great confidence in himself.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re really arrogant. Don’t you regret it!”</p><p>Hong tie snorted coldly. The muscles on his body wriggled, and his body swelled up. The metallic luster became even more intense.</p><p>A pair of gloves appeared in his hands. He stomped on the fighting ring and turned into a black light, rushing toward Eden.</p><p>With a single punch, the entire fighting ring shook violently.</p><p>“Chi, Chi …”</p><p>The nine-string zither in Eden’s hand floated in front of him. He played the zither with one hand, and sonorous notes spread out like golden Spears and iron horses, as if thousands of troops were on the expedition.</p><p>The zither music was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Tie Hong’s expression changed. With a loud roar, he punched the air with his fists.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Tie Hong’s fist struck the air, producing a series of metal clanging sounds. Sparks flew from his fist.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Around the fighting ring, there was an endless amount of sharp Qi shooting out.</p><p>Fortunately, there was a layer of light around the fighting ring that blocked these attacks.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Tie Hong’s body trembled in mid-air as he took a few steps back.</p><p>The nine-string zither in Eden’s hand also buzzed and vibrated, and he slid back a meter.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>The short exchange of blows allowed them to see the strength of the two.</p><p>Tie Hong’s cultivation had actually reached the astonishing peak of the eighth level spiritual God Realm. He was even stronger than Bing Leng, Ji hongchen, and the others. He was no weaker than young master Lin.</p><p>Eden, on the other hand, was even more unfathomable. In the exchange just now, many people couldn’t see through Eden’s depths at all.</p><p>“Again, divine metal breaking the heavens!”</p><p>Tie Hong roared, his entire body turned into metal, like an invincible God of War. He rushed towards Eden and unleashed his martial technique.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The zither music of Eden started to become more and more rapid. It was as if hundreds of millions of experts were fighting, and the murderous aura was shocking.</p><p>This kind of attack could kill without a trace. It was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Bursts of rumbling sounds continuously rang out in the air, even more concentrated than iron forging.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of sounds rang out.</p><p>Tie Hong’s voice was like a great Bell. The more he fought, the fiercer he became. Sometimes, he completely disregarded defense and launched a crazy attack.</p><p>His body was a Supreme spiritual weapon with unparalleled defense and attack power.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Tie Hong’s eyes revealed a malevolent look.</p><p>He was the number one genius of the godly metal continent. He was confident that he would not be weaker than anyone. He would even defeat the geniuses of the divine Ruins continent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
