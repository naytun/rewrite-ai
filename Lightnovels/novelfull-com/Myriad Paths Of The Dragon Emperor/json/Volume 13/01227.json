They stood high up and looked down on the other heroes.</p><p>...</p><p>For a moment, no one went up to challenge anymore.</p><p>Of course, it didn’t mean that these 36 were the strongest out of the 1000 heaven’s favorites. There were also some who didn’t want to go up.</p><p>For example, Long Chen.</p><p>Now that Long Chen’s cultivation had reached the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm, he would definitely be able to occupy a mountain peak with the terrifying power of his immemorial Dragon elephant bloodline.</p><p>There was also Lu Ming. Now that his nine Dragon bloodline had advanced to the ninth level of the divine level, his combat strength had become even stronger. It would not be much of a problem for him to occupy a mountain peak.</p><p>Among the remaining geniuses, how could there not be a heaven’s favorite with terrifying strength? It was just that due to various reasons, he didn’t make a move.</p><p>After all, the Tian Shen sect had not started the selection process yet. There was no need for some people to reveal their strength.</p><p>hahaha, it seems like your South God Palace can’t hold on any longer. You’ve only occupied seven mountain peaks!</p><p>A loud laugh was heard from an Emperor of the Western deity Palace.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s expression was somewhat unsightly. There were a total of thirty-six mountain peaks, and the southern deity Palace’s side only occupied seven of them. Their strength was clearly on the weaker side.</p><p>The strength of the Western deity Palace and the southern deity Palace had always been similar. The competition between them was naturally very strong, and they would often compare themselves with each other.</p><p>Moreover, in this selection of disciples by the Tian Shen sect, the party that successfully joined the Tian Shen sect would naturally receive more rewards from the sect.</p><p>Hmph, the geniuses of our South God Palace are just not that high-profile!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man snorted.</p><p>haha, so you’re saying that there are many heaven’s favorites who can reach the Phecda peak in your South God Palace? ”</p><p>The Emperor of the Western deity Palace sneered.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s face was cold and he didn’t say anything. He wasn’t confident either. He was just trying to hold on by saying that.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, one of the altars in the sky suddenly trembled slightly. Countless inscriptions flashed and light filled the air.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled as they looked at the altar with hope.</p><p>Legend had it that the nine ancient altars were the spatial path that led to the major forces of the yuan continent. A long time ago, the continent of the divine Ruins was able to communicate with the nine major forces of the yuan continent.</p><p>That was why there were nine altars.</p><p>But now, the divine Ruins continent had long lost contact with the nine major forces, and the nine ancient altars had not been activated for a long time.</p><p>Some time ago, one of the forces, the tianshen sect, suddenly got in touch with the divine Ruins continent and issued an order to select disciples.</p><p>Now, was the expert from the tianshen sect, a major power of the yuan continent, about to arrive?</p><p>That was a major power of the yuan continent. Most of the People’s eyes were burning as they stared at the altar above.</p><p>The yuan continent was the core of the yuan realm. It was the place that all cultivators yearned for, the Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>Over there, there were experts who truly stood at the peak!</p><p>Legend had it that there were unparalleled mighty people who had survived from ancient times.</p><p>There were countless paragons there.</p><p>That place was extremely prosperous.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one had ever been there, not even many emperors.</p><p>Now, he was finally going to meet the strong cultivators of the major forces of the yuan continent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The light grew brighter and brighter. Finally, a door of light appeared on the ancient altar. Then, everyone saw figures emerging from the door of light.</p><p>There were a total of six figures. The one in the lead was a silver-haired old man, and behind him were two middle-aged men.</p><p>The three of them were just standing there casually, but they exuded an unparalleled pressure. The pressure was like a divine mountain weighing hundreds of millions of pounds, pressing down on everyone’s hearts and making it difficult for them to breathe.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. The pressure that these three people gave off was far above that of the black-robed middle-aged man. In other words, these three people were all above the third level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Behind the three of them were three youths.</p><p>Two men and one woman, the men were handsome and the woman was beautiful.</p><p>The three young men and women looked around with a hint of curiosity in their eyes. However, there was more arrogance and disdain in their eyes. It was as if they were high and mighty emperors facing some beggars.</p><p>“Greetings, emissary of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>The emperors of the four great divine palaces hurriedly saluted with great respect.</p><p>“Greetings, emissary of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>The others, including the emissaries of the ancient city of the divine Ruins, also saluted respectfully one after another.</p><p>Are all the paragons of the divine Ruins ‘continent group here? ”</p><p>The leading silver-haired old man spoke. His voice was melodious and resounded in everyone’s ears. No matter how far away they were, they could hear it clearly.</p><p>reporting to the emissary, all the strongest paragons of the divine Ruins continent group are here!</p><p>An Emperor from the North God Palace said respectfully.</p><p>good. From now on, my heavenly God sect will choose a group of heroes to join the heavenly God sect. There is no limit to the number. The main thing is your performance. If your performance is good, you will naturally be able to join the heavenly God sect!</p><p>therefore, you will have to go through a series of examinations. There will be two rounds in total. Now, we will be setting up the venue for the first round of examinations. It will take seven days. So, the first round of examinations will be held in seven days. You can come back here in seven days!</p><p>The silver-haired old man announced.</p><p>“Yes, we will take our leave!”</p><p>The emperors of the four divine palaces saluted and left with the geniuses.</p><p>The four divine palaces had branches in the ancient city of the divine Ruins, and they all had their own stations. Very soon, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at a huge mansion. Inside the mansion, there were many halls and many buildings.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest each had a spacious room.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing entered the room together and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Xie nianqing sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, quietly comprehending.</p><p>In the divine Ruins, Xie nianqing had obtained the inheritance of an unparalleled powerhouse who cultivated the demonic path. He needed time to comprehend it carefully. The Dao Comprehension ancient tree could help Xie nianqing improve quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on another mountain peak. He waved his hand and a pile of raw gemstones appeared in front of him. There were millions of them.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s various concepts of heaven and earth had been greatly improved, far exceeding his current cultivation. It was time to use the rough stone to improve his cultivation.</p><p>In this selection, there were many geniuses in the divine Ruins continent. Lu Ming’s current cultivation of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm was obviously not enough.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged and swallowed the millions of raw gemstones in one gulp. Then, it began to refine them.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline had advanced to the ninth level of the divine level, and the power of devouring and refining had reached a terrifying level. The refining of origin stones had also reached an astonishing level.</p><p>Millions of raw gemstones were continuously refined and transformed into essential core, which rolled around in Lu Ming’s body like a tide.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>His essential core circulated and rumbled continuously. Lu Ming’s spiritual God became more and more solid and dazzling.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was also getting stronger.</p><p>Not long after, millions of origin stones were refined. Lu Ming took out another few million and continued to devour and refine them.</p><p>At his current realm, the number of raw gemstones that Lu Ming needed was even greater.</p><p>Just like that, the number of refined raw gemstones that Lu Ming refined reached an astonishing twenty million.</p><p>At this moment, a violent whistling sound came from Lu Ming’s body. The aura on his body suddenly soared.</p><p>Sixth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>After devouring and refining twenty million raw gemstones, Lu Ming’s cultivation finally advanced to the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, and his strength increased greatly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
