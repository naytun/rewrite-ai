He can’t win and left us behind to run away!”</p><p>...</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, he heard dandan shouting and shouting, as well as a rumbling sound.</p><p>But the next moment, all the sounds disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void. Dandan, bubbles, Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others all looked at him.</p><p>They were still in the ancient city, where they had fought with Hai Yu and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming, you didn’t leave. I thought you had left us behind and took the opportunity to escape!</p><p>Dandan shouted and ran toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble cried out and its body glowed. It flashed in the air and appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder in the next moment.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Figures flickered. Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I told you that you can’t run away. Hand over the cultivation method for the pure spirit body!”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted coldly. He was holding an Emperor spiritual weapon battleaxe, and his aura was terrifying.</p><p>the cultivation method of a pure spirit body belongs to the sea demon race! let’s go! said the flood Dragon sovereign. The Dragon vein sword floated above his head, and sword Qi seeped out of it, cutting open the space.</p><p>“Dandan, how long have I been away?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with Hai Yu, the flood Dragon sovereign, and the others. He turned to ask dandan.</p><p>“Not long, just a dozen breaths, but do you know how dangerous that was? Fortunately, I have many tricks up my sleeve and managed to escape with my life. Otherwise, I would have died long ago!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Only a dozen breaths!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Even though he knew that time was accelerated in the primal Chaos Palace and that a few years in the primal Chaos Palace was only a few moments in the outside world, he still felt that it was unbelievable to experience it for himself.</p><p>In just a dozen breaths, his strength had undergone a tremendous change.</p><p>“Hmph, you dare to ignore us? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was ignoring them, Hai Yu’s eyes turned cold. He held the battleaxe and swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this axe had completely reached the level of an Emperor. It was terrifyingly strong.</p><p>“Dandan, bubble, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed. Then, his figure emitted the aura of the concept of wind.</p><p>Chaos intent could transform into other intents at will.</p><p>“Wind elemental technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure swayed slightly. His body was like a Phantom. He dodged Hai Yu’s axe in a flash and headed toward the other Supreme-beings behind Hai Yu.</p><p>The wind elemental technique was a martial technique of creation that focused on movement techniques. When performed, one’s body would become ethereal and traceless.</p><p>After avoiding Hai Yu’s attack, Lu Ming appeared in front of the other Supreme martial artists from the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming hollered as the essential core in his body burst out. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch.</p><p>“Attack, attack together!”</p><p>One of the Supreme-beings roared. He was shocked by the power of Lu Ming’s punch and immediately used the fusion of blood meridians to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the Supreme-being’s bloodline was scattered. His true form appeared with a horrified expression on his face. Then, his body split into pieces and exploded in the air.</p><p>“Heavens, heavens!”</p><p>“He killed a Supreme martial artist with one punch!</p><p>In the distance, the other spectators were almost scared to death as they started to shout incoherently.</p><p>It was too shocking and too terrifying. Killing a Supreme martial artist with a single punch, what kind of battle prowess did this require? Could it be that Lu Ming was an Emperor?</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>When the other Supreme martial artists saw this, they were simply scared out of their wits. They frantically shouted and retreated.</p><p>“You can’t leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning, emitting a cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the wind elemental technique and moved as fast as lightning. He appeared in front of another Supreme-being in an instant and threw a punch.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill scream was heard. Although the Supreme-being tried his best to block the attack, it was still useless. Under Lu Ming’s punch, all his defenses were as fragile as tofu. Lu Ming destroyed them as easily as breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. He was killed in the air.</p><p>“The second one!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then charged towards the third person.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the chaos will. However, his current cultivation had already broken through to the perfected spiritual God Realm. His combat strength had improved greatly. Killing these ordinary Supremes was as easy as killing chickens and dogs.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered continuously as he swung his fists. Every punch killed a Supreme-being.</p><p>This scene was too terrifying, causing the surrounding people to feel a chill.</p><p>This was a Supreme martial artist. Even in the divine Ruins continent, he was an expert and high and mighty. But now, he was like a fragile chick that was killed by Lu Ming without any power to fight back.</p><p>“Beast, don’t go! Fight me!”</p><p>Hai Yu roared. His eyes were red. These were the Supreme martial artists of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion. His heart was bleeding after seeing so many of them being killed.</p><p>He controlled the Emperor spiritual weapon to slash at Lu Ming continuously, but Lu Ming’s figure flashed. He did not fight Hai Yu head-on at all. Instead, he avoided Hai Yu and focused on killing the ordinary Supreme-beings.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another punch, and another Supreme martial artist was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming had already killed five of the Supreme-beings that Hai Yu had brought with him. In addition to the ones that had been killed earlier, there were more than five of them.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Hai Tian, who was watching the battle from a distance, was in disbelief. He rubbed his eyes hard, hoping that all this was fake.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect that your cultivation would suddenly improve so much after not seeing you for a while. You’ve reached the perfected spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and laughed heartily. She felt extremely carefree and proud.</p><p>“It’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered as he looked at the Supreme flood Dragon and the other sea demons.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, follow behind me!”</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign’s expression changed. The sword Qi from the Dragon vein sword soared into the sky as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming cast the wind element technique, and his figure was like a Phantom, untraceable. With a few flashes, he dodged the flood Dragon sovereign and attacked the other sea demon sovereigns.</p><p>join forces! Let’s gather together and join forces!</p><p>One of the sea demons roared. The other sea demon Supreme-beings gathered together, hoping to join forces to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a pity that Lu Ming’s current combat strength had far surpassed them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force crushed down, breaking through everything. A Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele pressed down on the body of a Supreme sea demon. The Supreme sea demon screamed as his body was pierced through, and he died on the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming was like an invincible God of War, invincible in every battle!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. At the same time, his third bloodline appeared, and its power was even more shocking.</p><p>The Dragon claws continued to slash out, tearing through everything and killing several of the Supreme sea demons.</p><p>In just the space of a few breaths, four of the Supreme sea demons had been killed.</p><p>join forces! Join forces to kill him!</p><p>Hai Yu arrived with his battle axe.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign also roared in anger and charged towards Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>The two of them joined forces to surround Lu Ming and attack him.</p><p>“It’s time to settle the score with you guys!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not Dodge. Instead, he looked coldly at Hai Yu and the flood Dragon sovereign.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
