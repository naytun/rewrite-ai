You actually dare to enter?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted. Everyone looked over and saw a young man Walking in the Air, heading toward the swamp.</p><p>This young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s true. This kid really doesn’t want to live. He actually dares to rush in.</p><p>“Such great courage!”</p><p>“In my opinion, it’s not that he’s gutsy, but that he’s overestimating his own abilities. He’s blinded by greed. When paragons fight, it’s incredibly dangerous. If he gets caught in the middle of it, he’ll definitely die. This kid should’ve died long ago!”</p><p>“That’s right, he’s too overconfident. How old does he look? How strong can his cultivation be?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked towards the swamp, causing a commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming could hear all these discussions clearly, but he could not be bothered with them. He flew forward and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“But then again, it’s rare to see so many Supreme martial artists fighting. It’d be a pity to miss it!”</p><p>you’re right. Do you want to go in and watch? that’s too dangerous!</p><p>we’ll hide in the distance and watch. If the situation doesn’t look right, we’ll retreat immediately. There shouldn’t be a problem!</p><p>Someone said, showing an expression of interest.</p><p>It was rare to see a battle between sovereigns, especially between many sovereigns. For some ninth level spiritual God Realm martial artists, especially those in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm, it would have a great boosting effect.</p><p>Seeing how a Supreme-being used the embryonic form of a domain might inspire some great circle spiritual God martial artists, allowing them to comprehend the embryonic form of a domain and step into the Supreme-being realm.</p><p>Many people were moved by his words.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll watch from a distance. There shouldn’t be any problems. That kid just now probably had the same idea!</p><p>Someone said, then flew into the swamp.</p><p>After the first one, the second one followed. Then, many people flew into the swamp.</p><p>Some of the eighth, ninth, and perfected spiritual God Realm experts rushed into the swamp.</p><p>Of course, no matter how low one’s cultivation was, they really didn’t dare to enter. If the difference was too great, if a battle broke out, they wouldn’t even be able to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. He was surrounded by endless swamps.</p><p>However, along the way, he could see traces of a big battle from time to time. Lu Ming followed these traces and continued his pursuit.</p><p>An hour later, a few figures appeared in the air.</p><p>There were three of them, an old man and a middle-aged man. All of them had strong auras and were Supreme-being experts.</p><p>However, these three people were standing around a young man, protecting him in the middle. It was obvious that this young man was their leader.</p><p>“Only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm!”</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual senses, Lu Ming discovered that the youth was only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. It could be said that his cultivation was very low and Lu Ming did not take him seriously at all. However, the other party’s identity was obviously not ordinary. He had a few Supreme-beings protecting him.</p><p>The other party also saw Lu Ming. The young man cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Hmph, you overestimate yourself. You actually dared to chase me here. You’re really looking for death!</p><p>The young man snorted, a disdainful sneer on his face.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure flew over from the distance. It was a white-haired elder, who was also a Supreme-being expert.</p><p>The white-haired old man came to the young man’s side and bowed, ” young master, we’ve found out that the hundred poisons master is hiding in the dark swamp in front of us. He’s using the poisonous gas in the dark swamp to set up a poisonous gas array!</p><p>“Hmph, does the hundred poisons Paragon think that he can stop us with mere poisonous gas? How naive! Let’s go, let’s attack together and break the poison array, then kill the hundred poisons master!”</p><p>let’s go! the young man ordered as he led the Supreme martial artists forward.</p><p>They did not even look at Lu Ming and completely ignored him.</p><p>In their eyes, Lu Ming was just a curious person who came to watch the show. He was not a threat to them and could be completely ignored.</p><p>Not long after, a dull roar came from the front. It was obvious that someone had made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes. He took a step forward and flew toward the source of the sound.</p><p>At this moment, a large group of people appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>They were all experts at the eighth, ninth, and even the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. They had also come here.</p><p>“There are fluctuations of a great battle ahead. It must be a Supreme martial artist. Let’s advance carefully and hide in the distance to watch the battle!”</p><p>Someone suggested. Everyone nodded and headed towards the source of the voice.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at his destination.</p><p>In front of them was a pitch-black Swamp. On the swamp, there was a thick black poisonous gas floating. It looked extremely terrifying.</p><p>In the black poisonous gas, there were runes shining. Poisonous gas of various colors spread out and combined with the black poisonous gas to exert even more power.</p><p>The young man was standing in the void with two Supreme martial artists guarding him.</p><p>In front of him were three paragons, who were constantly bombarding the black mist.</p><p>The terrifying power caused the black mist to roil continuously, but it couldn’t be broken through at the moment.</p><p>Hmph, the poison array of the master of hundred poisons is quite powerful. The two of you, attack together and break the array!</p><p>The young man instructed the two Supreme martial artists beside him.</p><p>young master, we can’t do that. It’s too dangerous here. If we leave and something happens to you, we won’t be able to explain it to the Marshal!</p><p>One of the Supreme martial artists shook his head.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was too vast. The southern deity Palace ruled over a large area of the southern region of the divine Ruins continent, but it was also difficult to completely control it. Therefore, the southern deity Palace would mobilize a few commanders and lead the Army to guard all sides.</p><p>This young man’s father was the commander of the South God Palace’s coastal area. He held a high position and power, and his cultivation base was unfathomable.</p><p>This time, for the sake of the pure spirit bodies, he had brought a total of five Supreme martial artists. It could be said to be a big deal.</p><p>“In this coastal area, who would dare to touch this young master? You don’t have to worry. Go and help break the poison array of the hundred poisons master!”</p><p>The young man instructed. His tone was filled with confidence.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>The two Supreme martial artists were still hesitant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Right at this moment, there was a ripple in space, and two figures appeared not far away.</p><p>The auras of the two figures were extremely dense. They were clearly Supremes.</p><p>I’m the son of the sea suppressing Marshal, Hai Tian. The master of hundred poisons is hiding in this poison formation. If you help me break the formation, I’ll reward you handsomely! the young man was delighted.</p><p>“The son of the sea suppressing Marshal?”</p><p>The two Supreme martial artists ‘expressions changed slightly. They revealed a trace of fear, but it was only a trace.</p><p>we can attack together, ” one of them said. if there’s really a map for pure spirit bodies later, we’ll fight for it with our own abilities!</p><p>“You’re negotiating with me?”</p><p>Hai Tian’s face turned cold.</p><p>hehe, of course! Although you are the son of the sea suppressing Marshal, we are also from the South God Palace. The sea suppressing Marshal can’t suppress us!</p><p>One of the Supreme martial artists sneered.</p><p>They were all Supreme martial artists with extraordinary backgrounds. Although they were slightly afraid of Hai Tian, they were not afraid.</p><p>Hai Tian’s expression turned ugly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
