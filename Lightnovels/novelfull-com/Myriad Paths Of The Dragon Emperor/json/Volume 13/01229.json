He was far inferior to his opponent. In addition, he was in a hurry and could not block it at all.</p><p>...</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood gushed out as the black-robed youth’s head flew high into the air. Even his spiritual God was crushed.</p><p>“If we could seize your key, then there wouldn’t be a need for nine people!”</p><p>The sixth level spiritual God Realm young man’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Then, a strange scene appeared. The bloodline power of the black-robed young man who was killed began to gather towards the blood-colored key. The blood-colored key was resplendent and filled with blood-colored light. Then, it flew towards the sixth level spiritual God Realm young man and appeared above his head.</p><p>Two blood-colored keys appeared above the sixth level spiritual God Realm youth’s head.</p><p>hahaha, it was just a guess. I didn’t expect that I could really seize it. As long as I gather the nine keys, I can open this Palace alone and obtain the opportunities inside!</p><p>The sixth level spiritual God Realm young man laughed and immediately looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>you didn’t run away just now. Now, you’ll be my key!</p><p>The young man in the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm revealed a ferocious expression and cold killing intent.</p><p>it’s a blood-colored key formed by the power of the bloodline. How amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the other party. He muttered to himself with a curious look on his face.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had directly ignored him, the sixth level spiritual God Realm youth’s eyes bloomed with killing intent. He took a step forward and his figure charged toward Lu Ming like lightning. A blade light slashed toward Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>Just now, he had killed the black-robed young man with the same move. Now, the power of this move was even stronger than that.</p><p>The blade was about to hit Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>“Three keys!” He said.</p><p>The young man in the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm sneered as if he had already obtained three keys.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his pupils suddenly widened, and his eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>A Spear’s gleam had appeared out of nowhere and pierced through his dantian. It went straight through his body and crushed his spiritual soul into pieces.</p><p>Fast, the spear light was too fast and terrifyingly powerful. The true essence that covered his body was pierced through by the spear light as if it was paper.</p><p>“You … You … Don’t!”</p><p>He opened his mouth with difficulty, wanting to beg for mercy.</p><p>The spear light shook, and the sixth level spiritual God Realm youth’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>As soon as the young man died, the power of the blood in his body gathered towards the blood-red key. In the end, the two keys, which were glowing with a blood-red light, floated above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>There were three blood-colored keys floating above Lu Ming’s head, including his own.</p><p>there are three keys. It seems like I can kill one person and take the other party’s key. As long as I gather all nine of them, I’ll be able to open that Palace and obtain the Fortune inside!</p><p>I just don’t know if there are many of these palaces. If there are, then it would be a bloody massacre!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>In order to obtain the opportunities left behind by the sky god sect in the palace, those heaven’s favorites would definitely hunt others down like crazy to obtain the key.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried about Xie nianqing.</p><p>“First, we have to find little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and was about to leave.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two streaks of light streaked through the air and appeared not far away.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized both of them because they were geniuses who had fought evenly with the continent. One of them was one of the people who had been defeated by Lu Ming in the divine Ruins. He was at the sixth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The other one had short hair and looked strong and capable. It was Lu Chengzhou, who had fought evenly with the number two heavenly pride of the continent.</p><p>There were two blood-colored keys on top of Lu Chengzhou’s head, and one on the other.</p><p>The two of them first glanced at the palace, then at Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s him! It’s that divine wilderness continent kid!</p><p>“Three blood-colored keys!”</p><p>When the two of them saw Lu Ming, their eyes lit up and they were overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Chengzhou’s eyes were burning with excitement. He laughed and said, ” it’s actually this brat who dares to provoke me to fight to a draw with the people of the continent. Haha, give me your key!</p><p>Lu Chengzhou laughed heartily. He dashed towards Lu Ming in a flash, as if he was afraid that Lu Ming would escape.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>A scimitar appeared in Lu Chengzhou’s hand. The blade glowed like the moon and was aimed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his feet and his body swayed slightly, avoiding Lu Chengzhou’s Saber Light.</p><p>“Brat, don’t even think about running!”</p><p>Lu Chengzhou shouted coldly.</p><p>“Me? run? I’m just afraid you guys will run away!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He took a step forward and instantly closed in on the young man who had fought equally with the other young man on the continent.</p><p>“You … Get lost!”</p><p>The young man shouted and used the fusion of blood meridians to launch his strongest attack in an attempt to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then in the divine Ruins, although he was not Lu Ming’s match, he could still exchange a few moves with him. The difference would not be too ridiculous. Now, he had the confidence to stop Lu Ming for a while.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on his Blood Meridian. Instantly, the person’s Blood Meridian exploded. Even his physical body turned into dust under the punch.</p><p>The power of his bloodline gathered on the blood-colored key above his head and appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>There were a total of four blood-colored keys above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Chengzhou’s eyes narrowed slightly. Lu Ming’s punch had made him feel a little frightened.</p><p>However, he was still confident.</p><p>it’s not bad for a mere divine wilderness continent to have a Paragon like you. But you still have to die. Kill!</p><p>Lu Chengzhou shouted coldly. His blade light tore open the void and left a hideous crack in the space.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sharp gleam of the knife was aimed at Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>you want to kill me after fighting to a draw with the number two genius of the continent? let’s see what you’ve got!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and eight streams of dragon energy burst out of his body as he activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>The void seemed to be groaning under Lu Ming’s fist. The space within a radius of a thousand miles was shaking violently, creating ripples.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist collided with Lu Chengzhou’s blade light. Lu Chengzhou’s expression changed drastically, and his body was sent flying like a cannonball. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, but how can a seventh level spiritual God be so strong? ”</p><p>Lu Chengzhou shouted in his heart.</p><p>He could sense that Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the early stage of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. He was already shocked that there was an expert at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>However, his cultivation was at the late-stage of the seventh level spiritual God Realm, which was higher than Lu Ming’s. It was shocking that he was seriously injured by a single punch.</p><p>He was afraid.</p><p>“This is a monster, let’s go!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Chengzhou turned around and ran for his life.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. With a few steps, he crossed the void and chased after Lu Chengzhou.</p><p>In a few breaths, he was close to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Lu Chengzhou roared as he merged his bloodline and transformed into a scimitar.</p><p>The scimitar emitted a blinding light and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the scimitar shook violently before it flew far away.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw another punch.</p><p>With a bang, the scimitar exploded. It was no match at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
