He stepped on the air with his dragon claws and appeared in front of a huge octopus in an instant. He stretched out his dragon claws and grabbed the eight tentacles of the octopus. He tore them apart with all his might. The Supreme octopus screamed in pain as its body was torn into pieces and it died on the spot.</p><p>After killing another Supreme-being, Lu Ming didn’t stop and continued to kill the next one. This time, Lu Ming had his eyes on the flood Dragon Supreme as he charged towards him.</p><p>Behind them, Hai Yu and the others ‘attacks had arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron and hurled it at Hai Yu and the rest.</p><p>“The world in the mouth!”</p><p>At the same time, dandan also made her move. Her body became taller than a mountain, and she spat out a ball of chaotic light that seemed like a real world.</p><p>Dandan, together with the Thunder cauldron, successfully blocked Hai Yu and the Supreme-beings from the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, while Lu Ming continued to attack the flood Dragon Supreme.</p><p>He had to end the battle as soon as possible. The power of the spacetime imprisonment was limited, and it wouldn’t be able to hold on for long with so many Supremes trapped at once.</p><p>The claws of the nine Dragons were about to grab the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>“Dragon vein sword!”</p><p>At this moment, the flood Dragon sovereign let out a loud roar and spat out a black combat sword. This black combat sword had a true dragon coiling around its body, and there were dragon patterns on it.</p><p>As soon as the combat sword appeared, the sword Qi rushed into the sky. With a slight shake, it slashed at the transparent bubble. With a pop, the transparent bubble burst.</p><p>As soon as the transparent bubble burst, the terrifying sword Qi seemed to have broken free from its restraints and slashed violently at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good, it’s an Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He did not dare to face the attack head-on. He used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and retreated at top speed, avoiding the terrifying sword Qi.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The flood Dragon Supreme controlled the Dragon vein sword and continued to attack Lu Ming. The sword Qi swept across and surged in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming could only control the lightning cauldron to resist. With a clang, the lightning cauldron shook and the lightning in the sky was cut in half. The lightning cauldron was sent flying.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword used by the flood Dragon sovereign was an Emperor spiritual weapon. It was the Emperor of spiritual weapons, the highest level of existence, and its might was terrifying.</p><p>Most importantly, the king spiritual weapon contained a domain. If a Supreme-being used their own prototype domain to activate the domain in the king spiritual weapon, the power would be even more shocking.</p><p>Back then, Yan kuangtu’s Supreme-being position, coupled with the Emperor spirit tower, had displayed combat strength comparable to the weakest Emperor.</p><p>As for Yan kuangtu, he had only awakened an eighth grade divine bloodline. He wasn’t even comparable to the flood Dragon sovereign, so his battle prowess was naturally inferior to the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>In other words, the power unleashed by the flood Dragon sovereign with the Emperor spiritual weapon had completely reached the level of an Emperor, and even exceeded that of an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>As the bubbles rang out, a transparent bubble appeared, enveloping the flood Dragon sovereign and the others within. They were once again frozen in place.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The flood Dragon sovereign manically maneuvered his dragon vein sword in an attempt to break the transparent bubble’s restraint. However, no matter how powerful he was, he would still need some time to break the bubble. This little bit of time was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming charged towards a Supreme shark. The shark could not move at all as it was enveloped by the transparent bubble. Lu Ming’s dragon claws tore its body apart and it died on the spot.</p><p>He had killed another Supreme martial artist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the flood Dragon sovereign finally broke the transparent bubble and charged towards Lu Ming with a roar.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated and did not want to fight head on with the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>you guys spread out. If anyone is trapped, help each other!</p><p>stop! sovereign flood Dragon shouted.</p><p>The other sea demon sovereigns spread out and attacked Lu Ming from a distance.</p><p>One attack after another streaked across the void and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice was heard. A terrifying attack was launched at Lu Ming. The terrifying attack completely enveloped him.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end as he felt the threat of death.</p><p>Hai Yu had used the bloodline fusion to turn into a battle-axe, but now, another battle-axe appeared beside it, exuding an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p>‘Emperor spiritual weapon, it’s an Emperor spiritual weapon again!</p><p>Hai Yu also had an Emperor spiritual weapon. With his cultivation, he could activate it, and its power was no weaker than that of the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>Before this, he had been holding back and did not use the Emperor spiritual weapon. He was waiting for the right moment to launch a fatal attack.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming with this attack.</p><p>This attack was indeed very well grasped.</p><p>In a hurry, Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron to block it. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still weak. Although the lightning cauldron was strong, it could not unleash much of its power. He was struck by the battle-ax and was sent flying far away.</p><p>The battleaxe did not stop and continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest, watch me!”</p><p>Dandan shouted loudly, her four limbs retracted into the turtle shell. The turtle shell glowed and flew out, blocking in front of the battle axe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The battle-ax struck the turtle shell and sent dandan flying far away. However, dandan’s block gave Lu Ming an opportunity. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and retreated like a stream of light, avoiding Hai Yu’s fatal blow.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles opened his mouth and a transparent bubble appeared, enveloping Hai Yu.</p><p>Hai Yu roared and controlled the Emperor spiritual weapon to attack the transparent bubble.</p><p>At the same time, the attacks of the flood Dragon sovereign and the other sea demons also arrived.</p><p>With so many Supreme-beings and two of the most powerful people with Emperor spiritual weapons, Lu Ming was exhausted and at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>Moreover, the other party had learned their lesson. Everyone was spread out. Bubbles ‘spacetime intent couldn’t cover such a large area. It could only cover one or two people at once.</p><p>Seeing that one of them had been trapped, Lu Ming wanted to kill him, but the others immediately came to his rescue. More than ten terrifying attacks pierced through the void and attacked Lu Ming, leaving him no time to kill anyone else.</p><p>In that case, even if Lu Ming, dandan, and bubbles joined forces, they were very passive and were not a match at all. The situation was very critical.</p><p>There were too many people on the other side. In total, there were nearly 20 Supreme-beings, and two of them were top-notch Supreme-beings. Their combat strength was already extremely terrifying. With the addition of the Emperor spiritual weapon, it was completely two emperors.</p><p>With so many people working together, it was normal that Lu Ming and the rest were no match for them.</p><p>If other people were here, even an ordinary Emperor, they might not be a match for him. He was seriously injured, but Lu Ming was still able to barely resist. It was already extremely shocking.</p><p>However, it would be more and more disadvantageous to Lu Ming if this continued.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged a dozen moves.</p><p>The light on the nine Dragon bloodline started to dim.</p><p>“His bloodline power is almost exhausted!”</p><p>“Kill! He’s dead!”</p><p>Hai Yu and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the bloodline of the nine Dragons crumbled. However, before Hai Yu, the flood Dragon sovereign, and the others could smile, a stone tablet appeared. It rapidly grew in size and appeared in the sky.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
