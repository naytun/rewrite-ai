The lightning around his body grew even more powerful, and a huge single-horned rhinoceros formed from lightning rushed towards dandan.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Dandan’s palm collided with the giant rhinoceros, making a loud noise. The lightning rhinoceros was defeated.</p><p>“Watch my world and kill!”</p><p>Dandan shouted as mysterious patterns appeared on his turtle shell. These patterns would make people dizzy just by looking at them, as if they were peerless patterns that had existed since the beginning of the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>These runes converged together, forming a beam of light that shot towards Supreme lightning rhinoceros.</p><p>At the same time, dandan’s huge body soared through the air and charged towards Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p><p>Supreme Thunder rhinoceros let out a long roar and erupted with all his strength as he fought with dandan.</p><p>However, dandan was clearly stronger and was suppressing Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron to collide with the giant hammer that Dark Thunder Supreme had transformed into.</p><p>Just like the last time, the lightning on the hammer was sucked away by the lightning cauldron.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder roared in his heart. He felt that the situation wasn’t good.</p><p>In the previous battle with Lu Ming, he was stronger than Lu Ming in terms of pure strength. However, he was restrained by Lu Ming’s lightning cauldron, which was why he had been defeated and fled. That was why he had joined forces with Supreme lightning rhinoceros.</p><p>At first, he had thought that if he joined forces with Supreme Thunder Rhino, they would be able to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, he had never expected that Lu Ming would have such a terrifying turtle with him. A turtle could actually suppress the lightning rhinoceros Supreme and gain the upper hand. This made him apprehensive, and at the same time, he began to think of retreating.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had transformed back into his human form. He controlled the lightning cauldron to attack Dark Thunder Supreme while forming a seal with both hands.</p><p>Suddenly, three sealing gates appeared around Dark Thunder Supreme.</p><p>The gate of sealing shone with boundless radiance as the power of sealing burst forth, pressing down on Dark Thunder Supreme.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme’s face changed slightly. He felt that not only his body, but even his true Yuan and soul were about to be sealed under the sealing gate.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder roared as his true Yuan exploded forth, madly attacking the sealing gate.</p><p>Immediately, the three sealing gates began to tremble violently from the terrifying impact.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming called out.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble chirped and stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder, full of energy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, bubbles charged out and disappeared in a flash. The naked eye was unable to capture bubbles ‘figure as he was travelling through space.</p><p>suddenly, a massive transparent bubble appeared, enshrouding Dark Thunder Supreme within it.</p><p>At this moment, the giant hammer that Dark Thunder Supreme had transformed into stopped in the air.</p><p>“Time and space, impossible?”</p><p>An extremely shocked voice came from the giant hammer.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and transformed into the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. He raised his combat strength to the extreme and pressed down on the giant hammer. At the same time, the Thunder cauldron also struck the giant hammer.</p><p>Clang! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, the giant hammer exploded, revealing a shocked Dark Thunder Supreme who spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold as he continued to charge toward Dark Thunder Supreme.</p><p>At this moment, Dark Thunder desperately attacked and finally broke out of the transparent bubble. He wanted to escape.</p><p>However, at this moment, the space trembled and four transparent bubbles appeared, surrounding Dark Thunder Supreme.</p><p>Dark Thunder Supreme’s body stopped moving again.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder roared in shock.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The lightning cauldron crashed into his forehead, forcing Dark Thunder Supreme to swallow his words. His head was bleeding from the impact, and a large part of it caved in, almost bursting apart.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming arrived. At this moment, Lu Ming had transformed into his human form and wielded the Blood Sword formed by his third bloodline. He slashed out with the sword and struck the area between Dark Thunder Supreme’s eyebrows.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>An ear-piercing sound rang out. In the end, Dark Thunder Supreme was split into two by Lu Ming’s sword. Even the spiritual God did not manage to escape.</p><p>Supreme Dark Thunder was dead!</p><p>A Supreme-being powerhouse was killed in one fell swoop with the cooperation of Lu Ming and bubbles.</p><p>There was a time when the Supreme-being was so high and mighty, and Lu Ming was like an ant in front of him.</p><p>But today, Lu Ming had personally killed a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The bubble flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder, chirping triumphantly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and touched the little fellow. Fortunately, bubbles had helped him. Otherwise, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation and combat strength, he could not kill a Supreme-being.</p><p>If Autarchs were focused on fleeing, they would be far too difficult to kill.</p><p>However, the bubble had imprisoned Dark Thunder Supreme. He could not even resist, let alone escape. He was killed by Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>as expected of the space-time spirit rat, one of the top ten war beasts. It looks so young, but it’s so powerful. I wonder how terrifying it will be when it fully grows and reaches its peak!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He could not help but look forward to it.</p><p>Lu Ming cooperated with bubbles and killed Dark Thunder Supreme. It did not take long. In less than a minute, the scene fell into the eyes of the lightning bull and lightning rhinoceros Supreme, and they were horrified.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The Thunder bull roared, its eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>He stood not far away and wanted to see Lu Ming killed with his own eyes. However, he did not see it. Instead, he saw Lu Ming kill a Supreme-being, which almost scared him to death.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the lightning bull turned around and ran.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. Then, his figure flashed and he appeared beside the Thunder bull.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? I’m the young master of the Western deity Palace, and my father is an invincible Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert. If you kill me, you’ll end up in a miserable state!”</p><p>The Thunderbolt bull threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out softly. The bubble’s body darted out and a transparent bubble appeared.</p><p>This transparent bubble had appeared so suddenly that even dark Thunder sovereign hadn’t been able to avoid it, much less Lei Niu. He had been completely enveloped by the bubble, and his body had been frozen in place, unable to move at all.</p><p>This transparent bubble contained the intent of time and space, and it could imprison everything.</p><p>“No, don’t!”</p><p>The lightning bull roared in its heart and almost cried.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. He slashed with his sword and the head of the lightning bull flew high into the air. Its spiritual God was also strangled and destroyed.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros roared, his voice filled with anger, but even more so with shock.</p><p>He had wanted to save her before, but he was held back by dandan and couldn’t leave at all.</p><p>“I want to leave this place! This person is a monster!”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros roared in his heart as he madly charged forward, wanting to leave.</p><p>Unfortunately, dandan’s methods were endless. Let alone seeing them, Supreme Thunder Rhino had never even heard of them. These methods, under dandan’s control, displayed immense power, completely suppressing him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
