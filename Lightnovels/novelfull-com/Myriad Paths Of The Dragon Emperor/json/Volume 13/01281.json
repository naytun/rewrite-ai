Plop!</p><p>Many experts jumped into the sea and headed in the direction of the pure spirit bodies according to the map.</p><p>Lu Ming followed suit and jumped into the sea.</p><p>They were already in the open sea. The water was very deep. They kept diving, 100 meters, 1000 meters, and finally, they were more than 100000 meters deep.</p><p>At this depth, the pressure of the sea water had reached a terrifying level. Even a high level spirit weapon would be crushed into a ball under such water pressure.</p><p>The terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming. He circulated his essential core to protect his body and at the same time, he circulated the concept of water. A wonderful aura circulated around his body, and the sea water automatically separated itself from him.</p><p>Lu Ming looked very relaxed, but the others were not so relaxed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A first level spiritual God Realm martial artist’s body trembled, and his face turned pale. In the end, he spat out a mouthful of blood and no longer dared to continue down. Instead, he swam up rapidly.</p><p>At this point, it was already very difficult for an ordinary low-rank spiritual God ancient martial art practitioner to resist. They would be crushed to death by the huge pressure.</p><p>No matter how unwilling he was, he had no choice but to leave. This place was not the bottom yet. He still had to continue down, and he didn’t know how deep it would be.</p><p>It was pitch black all around, but those who could reach this place were all experts with strong eyesight. They could still see tens of thousands of meters around them.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The group continued to dive, occasionally checking the map.</p><p>Soon, they had reached a depth of more than two hundred thousand meters. The water pressure here was even more terrifying, and many people’s protective Zhen Yuan started to creak as if it would collapse at any time.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming discovered the underground mountain range. However, the rocks here were shockingly hard due to the terrifying water pressure all year round. They were harder than many strange metals outside, a hundred times harder than ordinary steel.</p><p>“It’s under that Valley!”</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and pointed at an underwater Valley below.</p><p>From a distance, it was pitch black, as if it led to the abyss of hell.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked toward the valley.</p><p>Obviously, the others had also noticed it and were swimming towards the valley.</p><p>The number of people who could make it here was much less than before, but there were still about a thousand people.</p><p>The one thousand people were like a thousand tiny fish, swimming towards the dark valley.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the sea water churned. From a pitch-black cave on the edge of the valley, a huge creature suddenly pounced out. It opened its bloody mouth and tried to swallow the powerhouses.</p><p>The berserk aura was shocking.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Someone bellowed, and a beam of sword Qi slashed out, slashing towards the behemoth.</p><p>The person who attacked was an expert in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. However, they were in the deep sea, and his strength was greatly suppressed. The sword Qi slashed out at the bloody mouth, but it was immediately bitten by the mouth. The sharp teeth bit off the sword Qi, and a Scarlet tongue rolled out, wrapping around the expert in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm and pulling him into its mouth.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The great circle spirit God Realm expert unleashed all sorts of terrifying attacks.</p><p>However, he was more than two hundred thousand meters deep in the ocean, and his strength was greatly suppressed. The aura of the monster that had suddenly pounced out was only equivalent to that of a great circle spiritual God. However, the strength that the monster displayed here was far above that of an ordinary great circle spiritual God.</p><p>The human great circle of the spiritual God Realm was no match for it. The Scarlet tongue pulled it into its mouth and with a crack, it was bitten in two.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>ah! the perfected spirit God Realm expert let out a blood-curdling screech. However, in the next moment, his screeching came to an abrupt end. He had been bitten into pieces by the monster and swallowed into its stomach.</p><p>“What kind of monster is this?”</p><p>Only then did everyone see the monster’s appearance clearly.</p><p>Its body was like a Python, and it looked like an eel at the same time. It was very long, and its tail was in a cave in the valley. Only the upper part of its body could be seen. Its body was covered in scales, and its eyes were blood red. It looked extremely ferocious.</p><p>Its mouth moved as if it was eating with great relish. Its blood-red eyes stared at someone else, flashing with greed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The next moment, he pounced again, opening his bloody mouth and biting at the human masters.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a Supreme-being shouted coldly and stepped out. With a wave of his hand, a prototype domain spread out and enveloped the monster.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The monster’s scales started to sizzle as it was enveloped by the domain.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Grandmaster took a step forward and appeared on top of the monster’s head. He punched the monster’s head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a boom, the monster roared and retreated. A part of its head caved in and blood flowed, but it was not killed.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>This monster was too powerful.</p><p>From his aura, he was only at the great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>If it was outside, a Supreme-being’s attack would be enough to kill a perfect-stage spiritual God. However, here, the monster was only injured and not killed.</p><p>Clearly, this monster lived at the bottom of the sea all year round. Here, the monster could display its strength, while the human warriors ‘strength was suppressed.</p><p>The human sovereign’s face darkened as he failed to kill the monster with a single strike. A snow-white saber appeared in his hand, and he slashed out. An astonishing Saber Light split the seawater apart and slashed at the monster’s neck.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood dyed the seawater red, and the monster’s head was cut off.</p><p>However, the monster didn’t die immediately after its head was cut off. Its lower body retreated frantically, trying to retreat back into the cave. However, when it was only halfway back, its life force was extinguished, and it became limp and motionless.</p><p>there’s actually a sea monster in such a deep sea. We have to be careful!</p><p>Someone muttered and increased their vigilance.</p><p>Once a living being appeared in such a deep part of the ocean, it would definitely not be simple and would be very dangerous.</p><p>Everyone continued to dive. The valley was really too deep. They dove another 10000 meters, but they still didn’t reach the bottom.</p><p>Whoosh! Huala!</p><p>Suddenly, the sea water churned, and there was a roar around the valley.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>At the same time, there was a screech. The sound was terrifying and made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>Then, to everyone’s horror, they saw dozens of huge creatures on the walls of the valley pouncing at them.</p><p>“Monster, it’s that kind of monster!”</p><p>Someone shouted in fear.</p><p>This giant creature that suddenly pounced was exactly the same as the one that had appeared before. Its body was like a Python, slender and long. Its eyes were blood red, its mouth was like a basin, and its body was covered in scales. It was ferocious and terrifying.</p><p>There were dozens of them here, and each one of them had a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Caught off guard, more than a dozen human masters were bitten by the monster without being able to fight back. The monster’s sharp teeth chewed them into pieces and they died on the spot.</p><p>An exceptionally huge monster pounced at Hai Tian and the others.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At the edge of the sea, a Supreme martial artist roared in anger. A long spear appeared in his hand. The long spear broke through the water and fought with the monster. After three moves, the monster was nailed to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>Although the monster was strong, there was still a gap between it and a Supreme-being.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
