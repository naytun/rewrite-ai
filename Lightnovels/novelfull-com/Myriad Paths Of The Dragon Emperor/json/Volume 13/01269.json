The other five Supreme-beings ‘expressions changed drastically, and they were almost scared to death. They retreated frantically.</p><p>...</p><p>In the sky, the burly man from the heavenly God sect, young master Lin, and the others also looked gloomy, especially the burly man from the heavenly God sect. His eyes revealed a fiery light, ” “This lightning cauldron … It’s beyond the category of spirit weapons, could it be a holy weapon?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect muttered to himself and roared in his heart: hahaha, I’m so lucky. I didn’t expect a holy weapon to exist in a remote place like the divine Ruins continent. I must get it!</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. Instead, he went to Xie nianqing’s side and said, ” “Little Qing, let’s leave this place quickly!”</p><p>This matter wasn’t simple at all. Six Supreme martial artists had been dispatched to besiege him at once. The force behind this must be extremely powerful. Perhaps an Emperor would come in person. Now, leaving was the best option.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and was about to leave with Lu Ming.</p><p>mu ye, ” the MU family’s master said coldly in the sky, ” attack and make them stay!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Beside the master of the MU family, a figure wrapped in a black robe bowed and acknowledged the order. Then, he stepped down.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were about to return to where they came from, an extremely terrifying aura burst forth. The terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“The Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically and he exclaimed in shock.</p><p>As expected, there was an Emperor behind this matter. When the Supreme martial artist was defeated, the Emperor appeared.</p><p>A black-robed figure appeared in the air. His face was obscured. He extended a withered claw and grabbed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. Suddenly, a huge claw as large as a mountain reached out to grab them.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made Lu Ming feel suffocated even though he was far away.</p><p>An Emperor was too terrifying. Although Supreme-beings were known as half-step emperors, their combat strength was far inferior to a true Emperor.</p><p>The withered claws covered the sky and completely enveloped Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, making them unable to escape.</p><p>“Little Qing, you enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. At the same time, he poured his quintessential essence into the lightning cauldron. The aura on the lightning cauldron grew stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The lightning cauldron expanded to the size of the withered claw, and it crashed toward it.</p><p>“No, I’m not going into the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook her head stubbornly. Her glabella glowed, and a black bead appeared. A terrifying demonic Qi rippled out. The demonic Qi gathered and formed a demonic light beam, which shot towards the withered claw.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two earth-shaking rumbles resounded, and a terrifying force swept across tens of thousands of miles, alarming countless people.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s happening?”</p><p>someone’s fighting. Who’s fighting? it’s so terrifying!</p><p>it seems to be an Emperor. There’s a battle between emperors!</p><p>A series of clamors rang out in the night sky, but no one dared to approach and watch.</p><p>What a joke. In a battle between emperors, if one was too close and accidentally drawn into it, only death would await them.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The lightning cauldron shook violently and was sent flying back to Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he was sent flying back thousands of meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Xie nianqing was in a similar situation. The demonic light beam was destroyed and she was forced to retreat a few thousand meters. However, the Black Pearl between her brows released a layer of light to protect Xie nianqing. Hence, Xie nianqing was in a better state than Lu Ming. Her delicate body trembled but she did not vomit blood.</p><p>This made Lu Ming heave a sigh of relief. Xie nianqing’s Black bead was obtained in the divine Ruins, and its mystery was beyond imagination.</p><p>Although the two of them were pushed back, they had successfully blocked the withered claw.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>This scene made the middle-aged man of the heavenly God sect sigh.</p><p>It was just two juniors, yet they were able to block an attack from an Emperor. This was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>This made the MU family’s master’s face turn gloomy and ugly, feeling that he had lost face.</p><p>Muye, go all out. Don’t show mercy. Just don’t kill him!</p><p>The master of the MU family sent a message to mu ye.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Upon receiving the order, mu ye roared and his aura became even more violent. He stretched out his withered hands and grabbed two claws in succession. Two huge claws formed and grabbed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two claws were much more powerful than the previous one. Shockingly, the two claws merged into one in the middle of the attack. It turned into a claw that exuded a withered aura and grabbed at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The power of this claw was even more shocking.</p><p>“Dandan!”</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and dandan and bubbles appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming, I knew you would come to me. My life is hard …</p><p>It flew out of Lu Ming’s shoulder while cursing and swearing. Its body size began to grow rapidly, and its aura also increased rapidly.</p><p>“Mouth-world!”</p><p>Dandan let out a loud roar and opened its mouth. A ball of chaotic light flew out from its mouth, and there seemed to be a world inside the light.</p><p>A world flew toward the giant withered claw.</p><p>At the same time, a huge transparent bubble appeared from within bubbles ‘mouth and surrounded the withered claw. The moment the transparent bubble appeared, the withered claw was frozen in mid-air, unable to move.</p><p>“This is … The space-time concept?”</p><p>Mu ye exclaimed in disbelief, then he shouted, ” “Break!”</p><p>The dried-up claw started to glow and the transparent bubble started to shake.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out, its snow-white fur emitting a milky white light, as if it was using all its strength.</p><p>At this moment, dandan’s attack had already arrived. It passed through the transparent bubble and landed on the withered claw. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s attacks also arrived.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The withered claw fell apart under the continuous attacks.</p><p>Mu ye’s body trembled, and he actually took a step back, causing the void to rumble.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>“What are those two things?”</p><p>Young master Lin and the head of the MU family exclaimed.</p><p>The power that dandan and bubbles had unleashed was too terrifying.</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect also widened his eyes and stared at dandan and bubbles. He muttered in disbelief, ” “This … It’s extremely similar to two of the legendary top ten Battle Beasts.”</p><p>His heart began to beat wildly. His eyes were burning with passion and disbelief.</p><p>Didn’t the legends say that the top ten warbeasts had all fallen? How could it reappear in the world? Could it be that it had the bloodline of one of the top ten Battle Beasts, but not pure?</p><p>Even so, it was still worth a fortune.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Below, Lu Ming shouted as he controlled the lightning cauldron. The sky was filled with lightning as he charged towards mu ye.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was going to retaliate.</p><p>So what if he was an Emperor?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Pearl between Xie nianqing’s eyebrows shot out a ray of demonic light. The demonic light turned into a combat sword and cut through the air.</p><p>At the same time, dandan and bubbles also made their moves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
