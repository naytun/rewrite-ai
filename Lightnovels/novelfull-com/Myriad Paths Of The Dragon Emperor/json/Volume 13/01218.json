His eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>The bubble earlier had slowed down Lu Ming’s speed. There was no other reason other than the fact that the flow of time in the bubble had slowed down. Hence, Lu Ming’s speed had slowed down.</p><p>That was clearly the time concept.</p><p>With thousands of intent realms, time and space were the Kings!</p><p>The time and space concepts were the Kings of all other concepts.</p><p>But in fact, time concept was stronger, more mysterious, and rarer than space.</p><p>That was the concept of the legends, and almost no one could comprehend it.</p><p>But now, a white spiritual mouse had actually mastered the time concept.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that this white spiritual mouse had not only mastered the concept of time, but also the concept of space.</p><p>To control time and space at the same time was unheard of. It was too shocking and terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there in a daze and only came to his senses after a long time.</p><p>“This spiritual mouse’s origin is absolutely shocking!”</p><p>however, it doesn’t seem to have any ill intentions towards me. It’s just curious and as timid as a mouse. No, it’s a mouse!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. After a moment, he continued to sit cross-legged.</p><p>As expected, not long after, the white spirit mouse came again. It was not far from Lu Ming, blinking its big eyes and sizing him up curiously.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming ignored him. He closed his eyes and pretended to cultivate.</p><p>The white spirit mouse wandered around Lu Ming and sized him up. After half an hour, it ran away.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and continued to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>The next day, the white spirit mouse came again, still sizing Lu Ming up.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and focused on his cultivation.</p><p>This time, the white spirit mouse seemed to be more courageous and moved closer to Lu Ming.</p><p>After half an hour, it left again.</p><p>But the next day, the white spirit rat came again.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered and focused on his cultivation.</p><p>On the other hand, the white spirit mouse would come every day and size Lu Ming up carefully. It became more and more daring and slowly approached Lu Ming. Seven days later, it simply climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>After a few days, it decided not to leave. It curled up at Lu Ming’s feet and actually fell asleep. A bubble appeared on its nose. As the white spirit mouse breathed, it grew bigger and smaller. It was unusually cute.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and could not help but reach out to touch it.</p><p>The white spirit mouse was suddenly jolted awake. It instinctively wanted to escape but it immediately realized that Lu Ming only stroked it gently. Then, it looked comfortable and continued to lie down.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>After a while, the white spirit mouse actually fell asleep again, and it was even making chirping sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. What a cute little guy.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming cultivated every day. The white spirit mouse seemed to be attached to him and stayed by Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“This … Is this a space-time spirit mouse?”</p><p>Suddenly, a shocked voice was heard. Lu Ming opened his eyes and saw dandan looking at the white spirit mouse in shock.</p><p>“Space-time spirit mouse? Dandan, you know her?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Dandan carefully sized up the white spirit mouse, her eyes revealing a complicated look, as if she was reminiscing, but also a little sad.</p><p>of course I do. The space-time spirit rat is one of the top ten war beasts. How can I not know it? ”</p><p>Dandan said slowly.</p><p>“One of the top ten Battle Beasts?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>the space-time spirit mouse can control time and space. It’s so terrifying. Even I would have a headache when I was at my peak. Boy, you’re really lucky. It seems that this space-time spirit mouse is counting on you!</p><p>Dandan said, her tone full of envy.</p><p>“Didn’t they say that the top ten warbeasts are unique in the world? Could this be the one from ancient times?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>He had already determined that this was a real space-time spirit mouse. Lu Ming had seen it use the space-time will with his own eyes.</p><p>I don’t think so. The space-time spirit mouse died in battle. If I’m not wrong, this one is the descendant of that one. I don’t know what method it used to seal it until now. This space-time spirit mouse should have been born not long ago.</p><p>I know. This is the time and space spirit Hall. The time and space spirit Hall was once an important place in the Hunyuan sect, the residence of the time and space spirit rat. Moreover, the Archean dragonesque elephant and the time and space spirit rat were good friends, so there was a statue of the Archean dragonesque elephant here. Unfortunately, this place has been destroyed!</p><p>Dandan kept muttering and revealed many secrets.</p><p>“Dandan, you look like you’ve recovered a lot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, of course! I refined the ten thousand spirit crystal. The ten thousand spirit crystal is the essence of countless Masters. Now that my cultivation has improved greatly, I can protect you in the future!</p><p>Dandan said proudly.</p><p>“Oh? Can you deal with an Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>cough, cough. I haven’t fully digested the 10000 spirit crystals yet. I can’t deal with the Emperor for the time being!</p><p>Dandan said a little awkwardly.</p><p>“If you can’t deal with an Emperor, what are you so proud of?”</p><p>Lu Ming was full of disdain.</p><p>“Kid, you …” Dandan glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“If we can’t deal with emperors, what about Supreme martial artists?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>cough, cough, I should … It can barely deal with a Supreme-being, right?” Dandan said with a lack of confidence.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. This guy was most likely unreliable and did not have any confidence in his words.</p><p>“Boy, what’s with your expression? I haven’t digested the 10000 spirit crystals yet. Once I’ve digested them, I can kill a Supreme-being with a single slap!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s disbelief made dandan very depressed. She stayed at the side alone and continued to refine.</p><p>Xiao Qing and Long Chen haven’t finished their cultivation yet. I’ll continue to comprehend the intent realm!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then continued to comprehend the concept of heaven and earth.</p><p>Time passed day by day. In a blink of an eye, there were still three days left before the day they set off for the ancient Divine Ruins city.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had ended his cultivation. They had to think of a way to get out.</p><p>A few days ago, Xie nianqing and Long Chen had finished their cultivation and arrived at this place.</p><p>In the beginning, Long Chen and Xie nianqing also wanted to enter the land of bones, but they both retreated in shock. It was difficult for them to resist the killing intent, so they could only give up.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step out of the land of bones.</p><p>During this period of time, each of them had great gains.</p><p>Cultivating under the Archean dragonesque elephant, Long Chen seemed to have comprehended a terrifying combat technique. Moreover, his cultivation also broke through in one fell swoop, from the peak of the fifth level spiritual God Realm to the sixth level spiritual God Realm, and even to the peak of the sixth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation improved the most. She was originally at the peak of the fourth level spiritual God Realm, but now, she had stepped into the sixth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Yes, the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, and he had already reached the middle stage of the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Xie nianqing had obtained the inheritance of a terrifying demonic existence. In the future, her cultivation would soar to the dream realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
