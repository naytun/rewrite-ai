He had cultivated his attack and defense to the extreme. He continued to advance, breaking through the zither music of Eden and killing his way toward Eden.</p><p>...</p><p>“Phoenix cry!”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice came from Eden’s mouth. At the same time, his zither music suddenly changed. It was like a phoenix soaring into the sky, and the cry of a Phoenix resounded through the sky.</p><p>A Phoenix could be seen flying out of the nine-string zither of Eden.</p><p>A blazing Phoenix bathed in Phoenix Flames flapped its wings and pounced towards tie Hong.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Tie Hong’s fists continued to swing out in an attempt to defeat the Phoenix. However, in the end, not only did he fail to defeat the Phoenix, he was also pushed back by the Phoenix. He was pushed back a hundred meters and his fists were burned red by the flames.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Phoenix continued to screech as it flew towards tie Hong.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! tie Hong shouted as his true Yuan boiled and a metal man appeared above his head.</p><p>In ancient times, there was a legend that the human Emperor had cast iron Men and shook the world. Tie Hong’s bloodline was this kind of Iron Man. There were nine major acupuncture points on his body, like nine small Suns, emitting ten thousand rays of light.</p><p>Tie Hong transformed into a man of iron and became even more powerful. He kept attacking the flaming phoenix and punching out with both his fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After dozens of explosions, the blazing Phoenix and tie Hong were evenly matched.</p><p>but at this moment, the cry of a Phoenix rang out, and a Green Phoenix flew out.</p><p>The Green Phoenix was bathed in the power of wind.</p><p>It worked together with the blazing Phoenix. With a flap of its wings, the wind boosted the flames and the flames filled the sky, spreading towards tie Hong.</p><p>Tie Hong was shocked and tried his best to defend, but he was still no match for the two phoenixes.</p><p>so powerful! Eden’s strength is truly unfathomable!</p><p>that’s right. Tie Hong’s cultivation has reached the peak of the eighth level spiritual God Realm. His combat strength is at most a little weaker than young master Lin’s, but he’s no match for Eden. Eden is too strong!</p><p>he hasn’t even used his bloodline yet. He hasn’t even used the zither on his back!</p><p>The onlookers stared at the fighting ring and the battle between the two, their eyes full of amazement.</p><p>He was just a member of the younger generation. With such battle prowess, he could definitely fight against a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>He could be called a Supreme youth.</p><p>After a few more moves, tie Hong finally lost and was completely suppressed. In the end, his bloodline body was defeated and he had no choice but to admit defeat.</p><p>After Hong tie admitted defeat, he was teleported out. A stone staircase suddenly appeared in front of the fighting ring. Below the stone staircase was a platform, and Eden’s figure was teleported to the platform.</p><p>He tried, but he couldn’t get up the stairs. So, he stood on the platform below the stairs and watched the battle.</p><p>As expected, two more platforms flew towards the central platform. This time, it was the beautiful woman and the other person was Bing Kong.</p><p>The stunning woman’s combat strength was also very terrifying. She was not weaker than tie Hong. Unfortunately, Bing Kong was even stronger. With a wave of her hand, she could freeze everything. Her martial arts techniques had reached an unfathomable level.</p><p>It didn’t take long for him to defeat the beautiful woman.</p><p>The stunning woman was teleported out, and Bing Kong, like Eden, appeared on the platform below the stairs.</p><p>Then, two more platforms flew to the fighting ring.</p><p>“Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. One of them was long Chen, while the other was sword warrior.</p><p>This battle had stunned everyone.</p><p>It wasn’t because of the sword battle, but because of Long Chen.</p><p>Jian Zhan’s cultivation was unfathomable, and his battle power was unparalleled. His sword light was shocking, and the power of his sword way was something everyone had long prepared for.</p><p>However, Long Chen’s combat strength was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Long Chen’s cultivation was only at the middle seventh level spiritual God Realm. However, his combat strength was so strong that even the experts of the major sects in the yuan continent were dumbfounded.</p><p>Long Chen transformed into the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline. With his bloodline martial techniques as the main force and his intent martial techniques as the secondary force, he unleashed a terrifying combat power. It was as if the Archean dragonesque elephant had come into being and was sweeping the world.</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant was one of the top ten Battle Beasts. It was famous for its combat strength, and few existences in the world could compare with it. It was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>It was obvious that Long Chen had gained a lot in the divine Ruins, and his combat power had become stronger. In a situation where his cultivation was far behind, he had fought with Jian Zhan for more than fifty moves and was finally defeated.</p><p>This caused Jian Zhan’s expression to turn extremely gloomy.</p><p>It was just a martial artist in the middle stage of the seventh level spiritual God Realm. With his combat strength, he actually spent more than 50 moves to defeat Long Chen, which made him feel very embarrassed.</p><p>the divine wilderness continent is truly amazing!</p><p>Many people sighed again.</p><p>In the top ten, three people from the divine wilderness continent had made it in. Furthermore, Long Chen’s combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>the Dragon God Valley wants this kid. He is a match for our Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The Dragon God Valley expert said, his eyes burning.</p><p>what a joke. Although the Archean Dragon-elephant, with the word ‘Dragon’ in its name, has nothing to do with a real Dragon. Don’t think too highly of yourself, Dragon God Valley. I think he’s very suitable to join my jiuxiao sword sect!</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect sneered.</p><p>“In my opinion, he is the most suitable person to enter my Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>Only the Tianyu demonic sect did not speak. After all, the Tianyu demonic sect cultivated the demonic path. No matter how talented they were, it would be useless to choose the wrong person.</p><p>After six consecutive battles, there were only four left.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Zi Wuji, and Xue Mingyang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two of the platforms flew toward the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned because these two people were Zi Wuji and Xue Mingyang.</p><p>The only ones left were him and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Finally, it was his turn to fight against Xie nianqing?</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>Xie nianqing flashed his pearly white teeth and waved his little fist at Lu Ming, causing him to smile bitterly.</p><p>The battle between Zi Wuji and Xue Mingyang had broken out. This was the most intense battle so far.</p><p>Zi Wuji was the strongest heaven’s favorite of the South God Palace, while Xue Mingyang was the number one heaven’s favorite of the blood Sun continent, which was ranked second. The two’s combat strength was almost the same, and their battle was extremely intense.</p><p>The two of them fought for more than 500 moves. In the end, Zi Wuji was the one who won and obtained the victory with great difficulty.</p><p>This battle had made everyone clearly realize how terrifying Supreme talents like Zi Wuji and Xue Mingyang were.</p><p>Early ninth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Zi Wuji and Xue Mingyang’s cultivation bases were both at the early stage of the ninth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>To be able to achieve such a cultivation at such an age was truly shocking.</p><p>Needless to say, Jian Zhan, Eden, Bing Kong, and Zi Wuji were equally famous, and their cultivation had definitely reached the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>This made the few young men from the four major forces of the yuan continent look solemn. It was obvious that they had not expected to see a young genius with such a cultivation in the mere continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>After the battle between Zi Wuji and Xue Mingyang ended, Xue Mingyang was teleported out, while Zi Wuji appeared on the platform below the stairs, just like the previous victors.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s platform flew to the middle of the fighting ring. The platform collapsed and the two of them landed on the fighting ring, facing each other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
