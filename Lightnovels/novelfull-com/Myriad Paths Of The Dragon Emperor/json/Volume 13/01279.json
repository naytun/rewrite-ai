There were no changes.</p><p>“There are two maps, strange!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Generally speaking, there would only be one such precious map. How could there be two? Could it be fake?</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m the son of the sea suppressing Marshal. I advise you to hand over the map so that you don’t get into trouble!” He said.</p><p>Not far away, Hai Tian said, staring at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming was talented? He was just a young man from the divine wilderness continent. In the coastal regions of the divine Ruins, he had to listen to him obediently.</p><p>Otherwise, he could have easily killed Lu Ming with just one emperor.</p><p>No matter how strong one’s talent was, if one didn’t grow up, one would still be just an ordinary martial artist.</p><p>The five Supreme-beings under Hai Tian surrounded Lu Ming and glared at him like tigers eyeing their prey.</p><p>The other Supreme-beings were also staring at the map in Lu Ming’s hands with burning eyes. They could not wait to take it for themselves.</p><p>There was really a map. It seemed like the matter of the pure spirit body was true.</p><p>The temptation of a pure spirit body to them was too strong.</p><p>Most of them would be stuck at the Supreme-being realm for the rest of their lives. It was too difficult for them to take another step and break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>But with a pure spirit body, there was hope.</p><p>As long as they could cultivate a pure spirit body, they would be able to form a true spirit body and step into the Emperor realm.</p><p>The temptation of becoming an Emperor who could live for ten to twenty thousand years and dominate the world was too strong.</p><p>They would not give up easily even though they knew that Lu Ming was very powerful.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into an inexplicable smile. He looked at Hai Tian and said,”You want the map? sure, I’ll give it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming flung the map to another Supreme-being, who was not the one who took orders from Hai Tian.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. They did not expect Lu Ming to hand over the map so easily.</p><p>“It seems that Lu Ming is still afraid of Hai Tian!”</p><p>Everyone had the same thought.</p><p>Hai Tian’s lips curled into a cold smile. He also thought that Lu Ming was afraid of him.</p><p>“So what if he’s talented? Without any backing, you still have to listen to me, don’t you?”</p><p>Hai Tian sneered.</p><p>Although he knew that Lu Ming had been accepted as a disciple by the Dragon God Valley, a major sect in the yuanlu continent, he was not afraid at all since Lu Ming had not officially joined the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Hmph, he didn’t even give me the map. When my big brother arrives, I’ll definitely teach him a good lesson!”</p><p>Hai Tian thought to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming threw out the map and it led to another chaotic battle.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming transformed into his human form. He took a step forward and suddenly appeared beside Hai Tian.</p><p>Hai Tian’s expression changed slightly as he chided,”Lu Ming, what are you doing?”</p><p>“Nothing much? It’s just that your face makes me very unhappy. Moreover, you have the intention to kill me. You wanted to kill me before. I’m a person who holds grudges!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You … You dare?”</p><p>Hai Tian’s expression changed.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his hand and slapped Hai Tian’s face, causing him to spin dozens of times. One side of his face was swollen and he was completely stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to hit him?</p><p>Didn’t lu Ming hand over the map just now because he was afraid of him? How dare she hit him now?</p><p>Hai Tian felt that his brain couldn’t process this.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Hai Tian’s Supreme-being subordinates roared and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a step forward. His figure disappeared and he was nowhere to be seen in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill Hai Tian not because he was afraid of the forces behind him, but because he wanted to use them to crack the map and find the pure spirit body.</p><p>The map was very complicated, and the more people there were, the higher the chance of cracking it.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, Hai Tian came to his senses. He covered one side of his face and shouted madly, ” ”</p><p>He screamed hysterically, but Lu Ming could no longer hear him. He walked out of the swamp and soon, he was out of the endless swamp.</p><p>“That guy is out.”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming came out of the swamp, many eyes turned to him.</p><p>I was certain that he was going to come out. He must have seen the shocking battle between Supreme martial artists inside. He must have been scared and ran out!</p><p>“That’s right, that’s definitely the case!”</p><p>“He’s just a clown, why bother with him?”</p><p>A series of voices rang out, some of which were filled with disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered. He left the place and returned to the city.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming left, a group of people came out. It was the group of people who were watching the battle.</p><p>“How is it? How’s the battle inside?”</p><p>“Did a great battle break out between the Supreme martial artists? is there any news about the pure spirit bodies?”</p><p>Many people began to ask.</p><p>the map with the pure spirit body has appeared. The battle between the Supreme martial artists …</p><p>A great circle spirit God expert explained.</p><p>When he mentioned that the young man was Lu Ming and that Lu Ming had displayed his might and fought against the ten great masters, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>“You … You mean? That young man was Lu Ming, the most powerful youth? He even fought with the ten great Supremes, seized the map, and finally handed it over on his own accord?”</p><p>Someone asked in disbelief.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The person from before nodded.</p><p>The people outside the swamp were dumbfounded. Some of their faces were flushed red from shame.</p><p>Just now, they had laughed at Lu Ming and said that he was afraid. However, the fact was that Lu Ming could fight against ten great Supremes alone and snatch the map from them. His combat strength was beyond their imagination.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored them just now because he did not care about them at all. They were the real clowns in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>When they thought of this, their faces turned red.</p><p>Not long after, Hai Tian and the others also appeared.</p><p>In the end, Hai Tian’s side was stronger in this battle. He had brought five Supreme martial artists with him, and one of them had even awakened a seventh level divine bloodline, which made him stronger than ordinary Supreme martial artists. The five of them joined forces and seized the map.</p><p>After Hai Tian seized the map, he disappeared with the experts. Many people guessed that they were studying the map.</p><p>Many experts had secretly sent people to keep an eye on Hai Tian and the others ‘movements. As long as Hai Tian and the others discovered something, they would be able to find some clues by following them.</p><p>Lu Ming was also studying the map.</p><p>Of course, he asked dan dan to come along. Dan dan was an old antique and was proficient in all kinds of inscriptions. It was most appropriate to ask her to study this kind of map.</p><p>The two of them studied the map for two days.</p><p>all the lines on this map actually lead to some places when they come together. It’s a pity that I’m not familiar with the nearby geographical locations. Otherwise, I would definitely be able to find the destination by matching the geographical locations!</p><p>Dandan said slowly as she walked around the map with her claws behind her back.</p><p>“Oh? Then I’ll go and buy a few maps of the continent of the divine Ruins!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>sigh, even if we compare it to the map, it won’t be that easy to find it. After all, the map won’t be so detailed!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
