The heaven’s favorites from the other three divine palaces all looked over as if they were watching a show.</p><p>...</p><p>a beast is a beast. His brain really doesn’t work well!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Jin Yi shouted. His eyes were cold. The other paragons of the White Feather continent were all filled with killing intent, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Golden light burst forth from the Golden wings. It formed a claw with its fingers and clawed at Lu Ming, making a sharp sound as it tore through the air.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianqing and Long Chen’s auras burst forth.</p><p>“You don’t need to do anything, they’re just a few beasts!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the Golden wing’s claw, causing the sound of bones breaking to ring out. The Golden Wing cried out in pain and retreated continuously.</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but widen their eyes and look at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>The Golden-winged one was an expert who had reached the 36 Tiangang peaks. It was unbelievable that his finger bone was broken by Lu Ming with a single punch.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man from the South God Palace had been standing quietly in the void, watching indifferently without saying a word.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Golden wing’s finger bone was broken by Lu Ming’s punch. It flew into a rage out of humiliation and transformed into its true form, a huge Golden Eagle. It flapped its wings and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, divine wing’s eyes turned cold. He transformed into his true form and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two paragons who had stepped onto Phecda peak had actually joined forces to attack Lu Ming. How despicable.</p><p>that’s good. Bird meat that contains the bloodline of a divine beast is perfect for my meal!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The Dragon power in his body burst out and he threw two punches.</p><p>The space was compressed into a ball wherever the fist passed, and the fist flew toward the Golden wings and the divine wings.</p><p>Two wails were heard, and the sky was filled with golden and black feathers. With one move, Golden Wing and divine wing were heavily injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming struck the necks of the Golden-winged and divine-winged birds with two consecutive palm strikes. The terrifying power exploded and the two bird heads were blown to pieces.</p><p>The Golden wings and the divine wings were instantly killed.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Many people gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Those two were prodigies who could ascend the Phecda peak. They were killed by Lu Ming just like that. It was a piece of cake.</p><p>The black-robed man’s eyes lit up with a flash of surprise.</p><p>He had some impression of Lu Ming. Back in the divine wilderness continent, Lu Ming only had an eighth level divine level bloodline, but he had easily defeated Mu Feng and caught his attention. Hence, he made an exception and allowed Lu Ming to come to the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s abilities were even more shocking. Even he was shocked.</p><p>As for Wang Zhen, Ji hongchen and the purple-haired young man, their eyes were filled with shock, astonishment, and solemness. Lu Ming’s abilities had caught their attention.</p><p>Many people from the other three divine palaces were also quite shocked.</p><p>“Who is this person? Your combat strength is pretty good!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect that the South God Palace had hidden such a character other than those three guys.”</p><p>Someone spoke. He clearly regarded Lu Ming as an opponent.</p><p>Among them, the lightning bull and the Ice Dragon snorted coldly, their expressions ugly.</p><p>“You … You killed Golden Wing and Holy Wing?”</p><p>A sovereign of the White Feather continent said in a trembling voice.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the bodies of the divine wings and the Golden wings. He said,”What’s wrong? You want to make a move too?”</p><p>“No… No… ”</p><p>The young man from the White Feather continent turned pale.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice was heard.</p><p>Wang Zhen stepped forward, his gaze landing on Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, you’re too vicious. Golden wings and divine wings only said a few words about you, and you killed them!”</p><p>furthermore, Golden Wing and divine wing are the two generals of our Southern deity Palace. You have killed them so ruthlessly. It is obvious that you are weakening the strength of our Southern deity Palace. With such a temperament, you are not qualified to participate in the selection of the heavenly deity sect!</p><p>In the depths of Wang Zhen’s eyes, there was a glint of ruthlessness.</p><p>Xie nianjun had told him that she didn’t get along with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. He had to seize the opportunity to impress Xie nianjun and win his favor.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Wang Zhen and sneered,”are you blind?” They wanted to kill me just now. Can’t I fight back and kill them? How about this, if I want to kill you, you just stand still and let me kill you!”</p><p>“You’re quibbling!”</p><p>Wang Zhen said.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? I don’t need to quibble with you. Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him and berated him directly.</p><p>This caused Wang Zhen’s expression to turn incomparably gloomy.</p><p>Who was he?</p><p>The three strongest heaven’s favorites of the South God Palace. The Wang family’s influence in the South God Palace was even greater than the MU family’s.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in this manner?</p><p>kid, don’t think you can do whatever you want just because you killed the Golden wings and the divine wings. I’ll let you know that there’s always someone better than you!</p><p>Wang Zhen said coldly, a cold killing intent rising from his body.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed middle-aged man’s voice rang out, causing Wang Zhen to stop in his tracks.</p><p>the Golden wings and the divine wings were at fault in this matter. They wanted to kill others, but they didn’t have the ability and were killed instead. They can’t blame others!</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>Wang Zhen wanted to continue.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man stretched out his hand, and Wang Zhen could only swallow his words.</p><p>“Brat, you’re lucky today!”</p><p>Wang Zhen glared at Lu Ming coldly, then turned and walked to Xie nianjun’s side.”Don’t worry, I’ll find an opportunity to kill that brat!”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianjun nodded casually.</p><p>At this moment, a powerful fluctuation spread out in the sky, and a few figures appeared.</p><p>It was the silver-haired old man from the heavenly God sect and two middle-aged men.</p><p>As for the three young men, they were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>alright, that’s the end of the first round. Next, we’ll set up the venue for the second round. It’ll take half a month. Those who survived the first round, come back here after half a month!</p><p>After the silver-haired old man finished his announcement, he turned around and left.</p><p>Half a month later, the second round of the competition would begin.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with anticipation. After half a month, they might be able to join the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>After that, the crowd dispersed and flew off in different directions.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s roast some meat!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the White Feather continent trembled and looked terrible.</p><p>Soon, everyone returned to their residence.</p><p>Half an hour later, a strong meaty aroma wafted from Lu Ming’s courtyard and spread throughout the entire Southern deity Palace.</p><p>“Then … Lu Ming, you really roasted the Golden wings and the divine wings!”</p><p>The youths from the other continents were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Brother long, let’s eat together!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out to Long Chen’s room.</p><p>The door opened, and Long Chen stepped in.</p><p>“Almsgiver Lu, I wonder if I have the Fortune to eat a piece?”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk appeared. When he saw the two big birds that were roasted to a golden yellow, his eyes lit up and he almost drooled.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
