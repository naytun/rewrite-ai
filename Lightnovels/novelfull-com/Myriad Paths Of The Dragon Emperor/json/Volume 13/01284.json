They strode forward and passed through the many streets.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward as well. However, the strange thing was that he did not see any corpses along the way.</p><p>Screams could be heard from time to time, but there was no corpse.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but look at the mansions and halls on both sides of the street.</p><p>The doors of these palaces were tightly shut, and they were filled with a sense of mystery.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed up the high wall of a Hall, looking inside.</p><p>At a glance, Lu Ming’s brows suddenly raised.</p><p>There was a small courtyard inside the palace, and the small courtyard was filled with skeletons.</p><p>There was also a corpse lying in the courtyard. Its eyes were wide open, and there was still fear in its eyes, but it had long since lost its vitality.</p><p>“As expected, there’s a problem with these palaces!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the door in front of the courtyard. The door was open. It was dark inside and he could not see what was going on. It seemed that a terrifying demon was lurking.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming growled in a low voice and blasted his palm at the air in front of him.</p><p>This was because at this moment, Lu Ming sensed a dangerous aura descending.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s palm, the illusionary image of the prison-suppressing stele appeared, as if it could suppress everything.</p><p>The space trembled and a Black Phantom appeared in front of Lu Ming. It seemed to be suppressed by the power of the prison-suppressing stele and was twisting rapidly.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>It was a black shadow that seemed to have no physical body. It was just a Phantom with a ferocious face. Under the power of the prison defending monument, it twisted crazily and even squeaked.</p><p>The black shadow twisted and screamed, as if it wanted to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Resentment! This is resentment!”</p><p>Dandan spoke, her brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>“What is resentment?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>according to my guess, the owner of this ancient city must have died very unwillingly and had a very strong cultivation. Before he died, he developed a terrifying resentment. Later, some people who came here later were killed by this resentment, which created even more resentment. This resentment is extremely terrifying and invisible, making it very difficult to kill.</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“There’s actually such a strange thing in this world!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. The power of the prison-suppressing heavenly art was strengthened, and the prison-suppressing stele shook. The black shadow twisted and then collapsed.</p><p>“It’s not that strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t be so smug. It’s because you have the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele and a fragment of it. The prison-suppressing stele can suppress everything, especially some evil things. It has a strong restraining power, which is why you can suppress and kill them. If you use other means, it’ll be very difficult to kill a wisp of resentment!</p><p>Dandan cast a disdainful glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I see!” Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful. That wisp of resentment just now was generated by someone who came after you. If you encounter the resentment generated by the owner of this place, it won’t be so easy to deal with!”</p><p>Dandan reminded.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He did not stop there and continued to walk deeper into the ancient city.</p><p>From time to time, one could hear screams.</p><p>Such a strange thing had scared many people. Many experts had gathered together to help each other and join forces.</p><p>This way, the situation was much better, and the screams were much less.</p><p>The group continued forward and soon arrived at the center of the ancient city.</p><p>In the center of the ancient city, there was a large group of palaces. It was like an Imperial Palace, and it was unknown how many palaces there were.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light shot out from the depths of the palace. Everyone saw a jade talisman in the light.</p><p>could that be the cultivation method of a pure spirit body? ”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>it must be, it must be. The cultivation method of the pure spirit body is mine!</p><p>“Get lost, it’s mine!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes burned with a fiery light as they charged toward the group of halls.</p><p>“Hahaha, a pure spirit body is ultimately mine!”</p><p>A black-robed old man’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>He had been waiting for this day for far too long. He was the one who had distributed all the maps. His goal was to find the cultivation method for the pure spirit body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His body moved and he scuttled out like a ghost.</p><p>the cultivation method of the pure spirit body belongs to our sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion!</p><p>Hai Tian, Hai Yu, and the others also rushed toward the group of palaces.</p><p>“The treasures of the ancestral land belong to our sea demon race!”</p><p>“Let’s go!” Sovereign Wyvern roared as he led the experts of the sea demon race into the depths of the palace.</p><p>Lu Ming did not rush in immediately.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful. The resentment in this group of palaces is very strong! It’s extremely terrifying!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He followed behind the crowd and rushed in slowly.</p><p>???!</p><p>As expected, many people let out shrill screams as soon as they rushed into the palace.</p><p>“What the hell is this? kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The palace complex was in a mess.</p><p>the embryonic stage of the domain is useful to him. Use the embryonic stage of the domain to kill him!</p><p>A Supreme martial artist shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that a Supreme-being had cast a prototype domain and covered the area. In the prototype domain, the black shadow formed by the resentment appeared and was eventually destroyed by the prototype domain.</p><p>After discovering this secret, the Supreme martial artists all used their domains to cover the area and erase the resentment.</p><p>In an instant, the situation reversed. Many Supreme-beings rushed toward the place where the Jade token was.</p><p>Lu Ming followed behind. He did not act rashly.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>A black-robed elder was the fastest among the palaces and he was the first to approach the Jade token.</p><p>He stepped on one of the palaces and flew up to the sky to grab the Jade token.</p><p>“You dare? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>kill! sovereign flood Dragon roared.</p><p>The other Supreme-beings also rushed over at top speed.</p><p>haha, the map was given out by me. The cultivation method of the pure spirit body belongs to me!</p><p>The black-robed old man laughed, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Without a doubt, the black-robed elder was a Supreme-being, and not an ordinary one at that. The bloodline he had awakened was definitely not low.</p><p>The black-robed old man’s claw was about to grab the Jade token.</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed old man’s eyes suddenly widened in shock. He finally let out an angry roar, ” “Get out!”</p><p>“Ah, get lost!”</p><p>Then, the black-robed elder let out a shrill roar and his power exploded. Some of the palaces in the ancient city were destroyed by this power and turned into dust.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people were shocked and stopped in their tracks, not daring to move forward.</p><p>Even the flood Dragon sovereign, Hai Yu, and the others frowned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
