They were like countless terrifying sharp blades that kept slashing at Lu Ming. Lu Ming circulated his quintessential essence and covered his body to resist the spatial storms.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spatial storm slashed at Lu Ming’s protective Zhen Yuan with a clanging sound. However, Lu Ming’s Zhen Yuan contained the five-colored will and the spatial storm could not break through his protective Zhen Yuan.</p><p>If an ancient martial art practitioner below the spiritual God Realm were to enter this place, they would be crushed into pieces by the spatial storm in just a few moments. Even an ancient martial art practitioner above the spiritual God Realm would not be able to hold on for long. Only a Supreme martial artist would be able to walk smoothly in the spatial storm.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and walked through the space storm, moving forward quickly.</p><p>They were in an alternate dimension, and their speed was extremely fast. With a single step, who knew how much distance they had traveled in the outside world?</p><p>A moment later, the space trembled and Lu Ming reappeared in the outside world. He was in the air above a Lake.</p><p>In just a short while, Lu Ming had crossed at least a hundred million kilometers.</p><p>However, the divine Ruins continent was really too vast, and its range was too wide. A hundred million miles was nothing at all.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to tear open the space and travel. Half a day had passed. He had no idea how far he had covered. When he appeared in the outside world again, he could smell the sea breeze.</p><p>it seems like we’ve reached the seaside. Let’s rest and recover before we set off!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and found a place. He took out the rough stone and devoured it to recover.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming’s essential core had fully recovered. He then flew forward.</p><p>There was a large city in front of them. From afar, it looked very majestic.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to buy a Sea Map of the divine Ruins ‘continents in the big city. After all, the continents in the divine Ruins were very far away from each other. The area of the ocean was much larger than the land. Furthermore, the weather in the ocean was ever-changing and unpredictable. It was very easy to get lost. He needed to identify the sea Map to find the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>the population of this city is really large. Moreover, the number of experts is shockingly high!</p><p>After flying into the city, Lu Ming realized that the city was bustling with people.</p><p>On the streets, experts could be seen passing by from time to time. Some of them had extremely deep auras, and their powerful auras were released without restraint.</p><p>There was another person who looked like an ordinary person without any aura. However, with Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could still sense it.</p><p>Supreme martial artist!</p><p>A few of them were actually Supreme martial artists!</p><p>On the street, Lu Ming actually ran into a few Supreme martial artists, which made him extremely shocked.</p><p>Even in the divine Ruins continent, Supremes were high and mighty experts, and they were rarely seen. Now, they had actually encountered a few Supremes while walking around the streets, which was somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Lu Ming felt that something was amiss. It was impossible for a Supreme-being to appear so casually. Something must have happened here.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming entered a restaurant.</p><p>In a restaurant, one could often get a lot of information.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming heard an important piece of news not long after.</p><p>Some time ago, a piece of shocking news spread near the southern coast of the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>It was said that on the south coast, a heaven-defying secret technique, pure spirit body, would be born.</p><p>If a warrior wanted to break through to the martial Royal realm, he had to form a spirit body. Every warrior had a different bloodline. The spirit body formed would be different, and its power would be different.</p><p>A spirit body had already transcended the mortal body. There was a world of difference between a spirit body and a mortal body. There was no way to compare.</p><p>Not only did a spirit body contain terrifying power, but it could also greatly increase one’s combat power. Moreover, the strength, defense, and recovery of a spirit body had reached an unbelievable level. It was not something that a normal body could compare with.</p><p>Even if an Emperor’s limbs were cut off, they could grow back quickly. It was said that even if a small piece of flesh was left of an existence at the peak of the Emperor realm, they could recover it. They were simply immortal.</p><p>However, it was too difficult to form a spirit body. It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>Many Supreme-beings had comprehended the embryonic form of their domains. They no longer had any problems with their domains. However, the reason why they were stuck and could not break through for the rest of their lives was because they could not form a spirit body.</p><p>If he could not form a spirit body, he would not be a Martial Emperor and would never be able to break through to the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Furthermore, when condensing a spirit body, one would also face heavenly tribulations, and the difficulty would only increase with each tribulation.</p><p>It was said that this secret technique, ” pure spirit body “, was not a true spirit body.</p><p>This was because the spirit body was transformed from the bloodline and had some attributes and functions of the bloodline. However, the pure spirit body only had the strength of the body and no attributes. It only allowed the martial artist’s body to have part of the power of the Spirit body.</p><p>For example, strength, defense, recovery, and so on.</p><p>Furthermore, a pure spirit body did not have any attributes. It would not hinder the cultivation of a true spirit body in the future. Successfully cultivating a pure spirit body was equivalent to having a solid foundation. In the future, the difficulty of cultivating a true spirit body would be greatly reduced.</p><p>This kind of secret skill was too amazing. For martial artists below the Emperor realm, the temptation was beyond imagination.</p><p>Therefore, when this news was spread, it caused a huge commotion, and countless experts rushed to the southern coast of the continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Even many Supreme martial artists were tempted and rushed over.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming could see so many experts in this city.</p><p>A secret skill like pure spirit body was too shocking. As long as he could successfully cultivate it, the difficulty of breaking through to the Emperor realm would be greatly reduced. The success rate would also be greatly increased. Even Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery glow after hearing it.</p><p>there is actually such a mysterious secret technique in this world. If I succeed in cultivating it, I will have another powerful method to deal with Di Yi when I return to the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Once he returned to the divine wilderness continent, he would definitely have to face Di Yi.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength had greatly improved, it was still difficult for him to fight against an Emperor, not to mention a strong person like Di Yi. He had to continue to improve his combat strength so that he would be more confident.</p><p>As for the pure spirit body, it was undoubtedly a powerful secret skill that could close the distance between him and an Emperor. If Lu Ming successfully cultivated it, he would not be too far away from an Emperor.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s true or not, but I don’t care. I’m not in a hurry to go back, so I’ll just stay here and observe.”</p><p>After making up his mind, Lu Ming found an Inn nearby to stay and gather information.</p><p>The next day, a piece of news was spread. There might be news about the ” pure spirit body ” in the red Devil mountains thousands of miles away.</p><p>As soon as the news spread, countless people rushed to the red fiend mountain. Lu Ming followed the crowd and rushed to the red fiend mountain.</p><p>The Red Devil Mountain was thousands of miles wide and boundless. It was filled with a red demonic Qi, so it was called the Red Devil Mountain.</p><p>The huge crowd rushed into red fiend mountain like sand scattered in the sea, not causing a single wave.</p><p>Lu Ming began to follow the crowd and made a big circle around the Red Devil Mountain. But after half a day, Lu Ming stopped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
