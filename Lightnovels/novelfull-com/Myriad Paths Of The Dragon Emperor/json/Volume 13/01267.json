This caused most of the heaven’s favorites who were not chosen to panic.</p><p>...</p><p>“Senior, junior is willing to join the Tian Shen sect!”</p><p>senior, I’m willing to join the jiuxiao sword sect. Please grant me my wish!</p><p>……</p><p>One by one, the young men knelt down, hoping to join the four sects.</p><p>you guys can’t. You don’t have enough talent and potential!</p><p>The expert from the jiuxiao sword sect waved his sleeves and rejected him directly.</p><p>Following that, Dragon God Valley, tianshen sect, and other sects also rejected him one by one.</p><p>“Senior, please grant me my wish!”</p><p>Some heaven’s favorites shouted.</p><p>alright, coming to the divine Ruins continent group to recruit disciples is already an exception. You don’t have to say anything more!</p><p>The voice of the white-haired elder from the heaven God sect turned cold. A faint pressure emanated from his body, causing many people’s faces to change.</p><p>Many young geniuses sighed and looked disappointed. They knew that they had no fate with the major sects of the yuanlu continent.</p><p>alright, this trip is considered a great success. Hahaha!</p><p>The experts of Dragon God Valley laughed, which made the experts of the other three sects look down on them.</p><p>Without a doubt, Dragon God Valley had gained the most this time. They had recruited Lu Ming and Long Chen, two heaven’s favorites with endless potential. Of course, it was a great success.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Long Chen, we’re going back to the yuan continent soon. Are you going to the Dragon God Valley with us now or after a while? I can tell you that the cultivation environment of the yuan continent is not something that the cultivation conditions of the continent group of the divine Ruins can compare to. It is countless times better. Cultivating in the yuan continent, your cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds!”</p><p>The Dragon God Valley expert continued to speak in a tempting tone.</p><p>Some of the heaven’s favorites who joined the Dragon God Valley had their eyes lit up.</p><p>“Senior, I’m willing to go with you!”</p><p>“I’m also willing!”</p><p>The young men nodded.</p><p>senior, I still have matters to attend to in the divine wilderness continent. I might have to wait for a while!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, Long Chen also said that he would go there after a while.</p><p>good. Lu Ming, Long Chen, take these two tokens, which means you are disciples of the Dragon God Valley. There is some information about you in them. I will give you two years. Two years later, you can come here with the tokens, and the disciples of the Dragon God Valley will come to pick you up!</p><p>The Dragon God Valley experts threw two tokens at Lu Ming and Long Chen. Lu Ming caught them and put them away.</p><p>my Tian Yu demon sect is the same. If you want to go, you can follow me to the yuan continent. If you have something to do, come back after two years!</p><p>The expert from the Tian Yu demon sect said.</p><p>“The same goes for the heavenly God sect …”</p><p>the jiuxiao sword sect is the same …</p><p>The conditions of the other three sects were the same as that of Dragon God Valley. Those who were willing to go to the yuan continent could leave now. Those who were unwilling could come here with their disciple tokens two years later and someone would come to pick them up.</p><p>Naturally, most of the young people said that they would head to the yuan continent immediately.</p><p>People like Eden, Bing Kong, Xie nianjun, and yang potian also expressed that they would leave for the yuan continent immediately.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, he naturally shook his head. He would wait for two years before heading to a big sect in the yuan continent.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, just stay in a broken place like the continent group of the divine Ruins. When we meet again in two years, I’ll definitely surpass you!</p><p>Xie nianjun gritted her teeth in her heart. She was very happy that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were going to stay in the divine Ruins continent group, but she also despised them.</p><p>In fact, most of the geniuses were disdainful. They couldn’t figure it out. Cultivators placed cultivation as the most important thing. Furthermore, geniuses like them were at the golden age of cultivation. It was the time for them to advance by leaps and bounds. Two years was enough to reverse this situation.</p><p>They were confident that two years later, they were fully confident that they would be able to trample on Lu Ming, who was ranked first this time.</p><p>In the end, only five or six people decided not to go for the time being.</p><p>The divine wilderness occupied three continents. Surprisingly, Ji hongchen did not go either. Clearly, she also had important matters to attend to and would only leave after two years.</p><p>alright, that’s it for this time. You can all leave now. For the four great divine palaces, my Tian Shen sect will naturally reward you according to your merits!</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect said.</p><p>Then, the experts of the other three sects also said the same thing. The emperors of the four divine palaces were overjoyed.</p><p>The assessment of the major sects in the yuanlu continent came to an end. Many onlookers slowly dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest followed the black-robed middle-aged man from the South God Palace back to their residence. They were ready to return to the South God Palace, where they would send a cross-sea flying ship to send them back to their respective continents.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that the black-robed middle-aged man and the other powerhouses of the South God Palace were very nice to Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Long Chen. They had a sense of respect for them.</p><p>It was not difficult for the crowd to understand. Lu Ming and the rest were now disciples of a big sect in the yuanlu continent. Their status was completely different from before.</p><p>The next day, everyone returned to the South God Palace.</p><p>When the South God Palace found out that Lu Ming had obtained first place and that he was from the divine wilderness continent, it naturally caused a wave of shock and envy.</p><p>Lu Ming, Long Chen, and Xie nianqing were staying at general peak for the time being. Ming Zi, the heartless monk, and moonless Bodhisattva, who were not selected, were also staying at general peak. They were waiting for the South deity Palace to arrange a cross-sea airship to send them back.</p><p>It would take a long time to arrange for a ship to cross the sea. They had to wait for two days.</p><p>Time passed quickly, and night fell.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, is miss nianqing here?”</p><p>After the sky darkened, a voice suddenly rang out outside the general peak.</p><p>Lu Ming, who was in the middle of cultivating, ended his cultivation and walked out of his room. He saw Xie nianqing walking out of his room as well. The two of them looked at each other in surprise, wondering who was looking for them.</p><p>After the two of them walked out of the courtyard, they saw an amiable-looking old man standing in the air.</p><p>“I’m ji Fu. Greetings, young master Lu Ming and miss nianqing!”</p><p>The old man hurriedly saluted Lu Ming and Xie nianqing when he saw them.</p><p>“Senior doesn’t need to be so polite. May I know why senior is looking for the two of us?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and asked.</p><p>“My family’s young miss asked me to come. She said that she’s acquainted with the two of you and will be bidding farewell in a few days. She wants to invite the two of you to a banquet!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“May I know who your young lady is?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“My young lady is Ji hongchen!” The old man smiled.</p><p>“So it’s miss Ji hongchen!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>“It seems like there’s a beauty who’s interested in you!”</p><p>At the side, Xie nianqing pouted and muttered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and sent a voice transmission to Xie nianqing, ” “Didn’t I also invite you?”</p><p>“I think I’m just taking advantage of you!” Xie nianqing continued to pout.</p><p>“Then forget it, I’m not going!” Lu Ming transmitted his voice to Xie nianqing helplessly.</p><p>“Of course I’m going. Am I a petty person?”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming and said,”Senior, please lead the way!”</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming could only sigh. He really could not keep up with the way girls thought.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, miss nianqing, please follow me!”</p><p>The old man was overjoyed and turned around to lead the way.</p><p>When the old man turned around, a cold glint flashed across his eyes. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not notice it at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
