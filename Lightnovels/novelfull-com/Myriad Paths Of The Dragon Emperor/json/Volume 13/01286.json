They screamed with all their might. Ear-piercing sounds rang out as they rushed toward Lu Ming with no regard for their lives.</p><p>In particular, some of the black shadows were extremely powerful and could pose a fatal threat to Supreme-beings. Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing heavenly art could not force them back for a while.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spine glowed. As the blood-red light spread, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline emerged.</p><p>Lu Ming performed the blood fusion and transformed into the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline. The word on the stele glowed with a brilliant light and its suppression power was greatly enhanced.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline enlarged to the size of a mountain and pressed down on a black shadow.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>With a shrill scream, the black shadows twisted rapidly under the cover of the prison-guarding stele, then collapsed and disappeared into black smoke.</p><p>Even the black shadows that could pose a threat to Supreme-beings were the same. Under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline, they could not resist for long and also turned into black smoke and dissipated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled, and its power of suppression burst forth. A large number of black shadows were turned into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming was not hindered at all and he flew toward the Jade card.</p><p>In a few breaths, Lu Ming was close to the Jade card.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk and turned back into Lu Ming’s appearance. He reached out his palm and grabbed the Jade card.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the Jade token exploded and turned into green smoke.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he looked gloomy.</p><p>Could it be that everything was fake? the cultivation method of the pure spirit body was all fake? It’s all a scam? Tricking them into coming here and getting nothing?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s expression turned uglier.</p><p>It was wrong!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked at a Hall below.</p><p>There, in the courtyard of a Palace, there was a figure sitting cross-legged.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man who looked like a living person.</p><p>However, with a sweep of his spiritual sense, Lu Ming knew that this person was dead. He had been dead for many years.</p><p>However, this person’s cultivation level was too high, and his body was so strong that even after so many years, his body still did not rot.</p><p>“This person might be the master of this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he made a guess.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming descended and landed in the courtyard. However, he did not dare to let his guard down and was on his guard. At the same time, he summoned the bubble and squatted on his shoulder. If anything went wrong, he could use the space-time power of the bubble to escape quickly.</p><p>However, after careful observation, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Moreover, when Lu Ming landed in the courtyard, the black shadows above him all stopped and did not continue to pursue him.</p><p>there’s no storage ring. Nothing was left behind!</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and was disappointed.</p><p>Clearly, even the storage ring of this expert had been taken away after his death. Nothing was left behind. Lu Ming initially thought that he could obtain the cultivation method for the pure spirit body. It seemed that it was impossible.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was stunned. The middle-aged man’s glabella began to glow. Then, a Jade card emerged from the middle-aged man’s glabella and floated above his head.</p><p>When the Jade token appeared, the middle-aged man’s body exploded with a bang and turned into a pile of ashes. The ashes scattered with the wind and disappeared from the world.</p><p>There was only a Jade tablet floating in the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He condensed his essential core and formed a large hand. He grabbed the Jade token and held it in his hand.</p><p>“Is it the cultivation method for a pure spirit body?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart started to beat wildly. He scanned the Jade token with his spiritual sense and was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>That’s right, there was a secret technique recorded in the Jade token. It was the cultivation method of a pure spirit body. By cultivating a pure spirit body, one would have part of the power of a spirit body. With the foundation of a pure spirit body, it would be much easier to cultivate a true spirit body in the future.</p><p>It was exactly as the rumors said.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. If he could cultivate a pure spirit body, his combat strength would definitely increase greatly. It would be much easier for him to break through to the Emperor realm in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultivation method of the pure spirit body could be regarded as an important inheritance. In the future, his family and friends could all cultivate it. That way, the chances of breaking through to the Emperor realm would be much higher.</p><p>“This trip was not in vain!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and read the cultivation method of the pure spirit body in detail again. He memorized the contents and put the Jade card away carefully.</p><p>He then scanned the hall and did not discover anything else. Lu Ming soared into the sky, planning to leave this place.</p><p>When the middle-aged man’s body turned into ashes, the black shadows in the sky also turned into wisps of black smoke and disappeared as if they had never been there.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and landed on the roof of a temple. He then ran wildly out of the ancient city.</p><p>Not long after, he had covered half the distance and was getting closer and closer to the exit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the sound of air being torn could be heard. Figures appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>There were a total of ten people. One of them was Hai Tian, the other was Hai Yu, and the other eight were all Supreme-beings who had been brought here by Hai Tian and Hai Yu.</p><p>The nine great Supremes blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the cultivation method for the pure spirit body!”</p><p>Hai Tian stared at Lu Ming greedily.</p><p>If the cultivation method of the pure spirit body fell into the hands of a big force like the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, it would definitely play a terrible role. It would bring more experts and even cultivate more emperors.</p><p>who said that I have the cultivation method of a pure spirit body? ”</p><p>yes, ” Lu Ming replied indifferently. He did not admit that he had obtained the cultivation method for the pure spirit body.</p><p>“Hmph, is there any use in quibbling? I clearly saw you rush towards that Jade token, so you must have taken it. Hand it over now, or we’ll kill you, take off your storage ring, and check it for ourselves. It’s the same!”</p><p>Hai Tian shouted coldly.</p><p>As for the fact that they had the chance to escape because Lu Ming had attracted a large number of shadows, he did not take it to heart at all. In his opinion, it was Lu Ming’s duty to attract the shadows and let them escape. It was Lu Ming’s honor.</p><p>Now, it was Lu Ming’s duty to hand over the cultivation method of the pure spirit body. Otherwise, he would die.</p><p>the cultivation method of the pure spirit body belongs to us, the sea demon tribe!</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard. Many tall figures rushed over and appeared behind Lu Ming, surrounding him.</p><p>It was the Supreme flood Dragon and the other Supreme powerhouses of the sea demon race. There were ten of them.</p><p>Now, the sea demon tribe had all taken human form, but the brutal aura on their bodies was frightening.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Hai Yu and the others growled as they looked at the flood Dragon sovereign and the others with fear.</p><p>this man is a human. The cultivation method of the pure spirit body he obtained should belong to us humans!</p><p>Hai Yu said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
