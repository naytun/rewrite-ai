Even if the tianshen sect didn’t choose Lu Ming, he might join the other three sects. Young master Lin would never allow that to happen.</p><p>Therefore, he stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>many people looked at young master Lin in shock and didn’t understand what had happened.</p><p>However, some people were enlightened as they knew about the conflict between Lu Ming and young master Lin.</p><p>half a day ago, Lu Ming had a conflict with young master Lin. They even fought. In the end, young master Lin couldn’t do anything to Lu Ming. I knew that this matter wouldn’t end like this.</p><p>“What? There was such a thing? Lu Ming is so powerful that even the heaven’s pride experts of the tianshen sect can’t do anything to him?”</p><p>I don’t think young master Lin has used his full strength. However, Lu Ming’s combat strength is truly terrifying. If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it either!</p><p>Many people were discussing. Many people were shocked when they found out about the conflict between Lu Ming and young master Lin.</p><p>The eyes of the white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect and the others moved, but they did not say anything.</p><p>The people from the other great sects watched with interest.</p><p>“You, what is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said coldly.</p><p>you are not qualified to Enter the Void passage and participate in the test!</p><p>Young master Lin said.</p><p>“Laughable. Just because you say I’m not qualified, I’m not qualified?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Deacon!”</p><p>At this moment, young master Lin cupped his fists towards the white-haired old man and said, ” “Deacon, Lu Ming has no respect for the deity sect at all. He thinks that he has some talent, but he actually looks down on the deity sect. If such a person were to join the deity sect, he would be an unruly person and not worthy of being trained by the deity sect. Please disqualify him from the assessment!”</p><p>“Oh? There’s such a thing?”</p><p>The white-haired old man frowned.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re really making irresponsible remarks. When have I ever been disrespectful to the Tian Shen sect? if I don’t grovel and grovel to you, then I’m being disrespectful to the Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t quibble anymore. You’re speaking arrogantly and looking down on my deity sect. I heard it with my own ears. Also, the Ice Dragon can testify!”</p><p>Young master Lin said.</p><p>“Yes, this is true!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon coldly spoke.</p><p>“Not only that, vice Deacon Zhao can also be a witness!”</p><p>young master Lin looked at the middle-aged man behind the white-haired old man.</p><p>this middle-aged man was the one who had appeared and taken young master Lin away.</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded and said, ” “There is indeed such a thing!”</p><p>The white-haired old man frowned even more when he saw two people pointing fingers at him. He pondered for a moment and said, ” “If that’s the case, then there’s no need for him to take part in the assessment!”</p><p>Young master Lin was overjoyed, while Lu Ming burst out laughing.</p><p>This was blatant slander. From the beginning to the end, Lu Ming only targeted young master Lin and did not say a single bad word about the divine God sect. This was purely false.</p><p>also, that middle-aged man was obviously in cahoots with young master Lin. Who knew what benefits young master Lin gave him?</p><p>No one from the other three major sects said anything. In their eyes, Lu Ming was just a dispensable minor character. They did not take him to heart at all.</p><p>“Ridiculous, really ridiculous. This is the disciple of a big sect in the yuanlu continent? His talent is average, and his character is even worse!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, his eyes filled with mockery.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? Who are you calling average?”</p><p>Young master Lin was furious.</p><p>of course, I’m talking about you. If everyone in the Tian Shen sect is like you, then I don’t even want to enter the Tian Shen sect!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the heaven God sect and young master Lin shouted in an overbearing manner.</p><p>“Brat, you managed to escape last time. This time, you’re dead!”</p><p>Young master Lin’s eyes were cold and filled with killing intent. He enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“I managed to escape last time? Are you sure you didn’t escape? Well then, I’ll challenge you in public and I’ll defeat you within ten moves. Do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His voice, which was filled with fighting spirit, spread far away.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming challenged young master Lin and even said that he would defeat him in ten moves. He’s crazy, he’s crazy!”</p><p>he’s definitely crazy. He’s the heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect!</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused a commotion.</p><p>The tianshen sect was a big sect in the yuan continent. In the hearts of the people in the continent of the divine Ruins, it was a high and mighty existence, an unfathomable and powerful force.</p><p>In everyone’s hearts, the heaven’s pride sect’s prodigies were unparalleled and powerful existences. Now, Lu Ming actually said that he wanted to challenge young master Lin. What was even more ridiculous was that he wanted to defeat young master Lin within ten moves. How was this possible?</p><p>No one would believe it.</p><p>At this moment, the heaven’s favorites who didn’t fly through the door stopped. They were not in a hurry to go in. Instead, they watched from the outside.</p><p>this Lu Ming is strong in the divine wilderness continent, but he still dares to be so arrogant here. Now, he even dares to offend the elites of the tianshen sect. He’s really seeking his own death!</p><p>Dark Child stood in the void and sneered.</p><p>“What do you know? I don’t think so!”</p><p>A voice rang out. It was long Chen.</p><p>Dark child’s expression changed slightly. He was very afraid of Long Chen, but he was disdainful in his heart.”Just wait and see. This Lu Ming will die a terrible death!”</p><p>at this moment, everyone’s eyes landed on young master Lin.</p><p>A heaven’s pride expert from a small continent was challenging a heaven’s pride expert from the heavenly God sect. Would young master Lin accept the challenge?</p><p>If he didn’t accept the challenge, he would lose all his face. If this news were to spread back to the heavenly Divine sect, he would not be able to continue living.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>young master Lin hollered in his heart and his eyes were really cold, ” “Alright, since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>When he fought with Lu Ming earlier, he did not use his full combat strength. He was confident that if he did, he would be able to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Moreover, it was impossible for Lu Ming to defeat him within ten moves.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>young master Lin was filled with killing intent and a green light spread out.</p><p>Above his head, his bloodline emerged.</p><p>He used all his strength as soon as he made his move. He performed the blood fusion and the martial technique of creation to the extreme as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. Nine streams of dragon energy burst out in an instant, and at the same time, the third bloodline emerged.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed towards young master Lin. As he rushed out, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s nine-Dragon bloodline appeared, the Dragon God Valley experts ‘eyes widened in shock.</p><p>“This is … The bloodline of the nine Dragons!”</p><p>it’s really the bloodline of the nine Dragons. There’s actually someone in the world who can awaken the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>The experts of Dragon God Valley were in disbelief.</p><p>“Dragon God Valley wants this kid!”</p><p>The leader of the Dragon God Valley team, a burly man, revealed a blazing light.</p><p>Dragon God Valley, as its name suggested, was related to Dragons. Now, they had seen the bloodline of Nine Dragons, which was really shocking.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>the nine Dragons stepped in the air and clashed with young master Lin. An earth-shaking explosion sounded out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
