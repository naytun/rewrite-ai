It blocked the attack of the Dragon vein sword. Although it was sent flying, it was not broken.</p><p>yes, my earth essence is about to break through!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Originally, when he entered the depths of the sea, he was closer to the earth and resonated with it. This caused the earth mentality to show signs of loosening. After the continuous battle, Lu Ming had circulated the five kinds of mentality to the extreme. In addition, Lu Ming had activated the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele, which made him feel closer to the earth mentality. It seemed that he could make a breakthrough at any time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled. Together with bubbles, dandan, Hai Yu, Supreme flood Dragon, and the others, Lu Ming exerted all his skills to the extreme. While they were fighting, Lu Ming was also comprehending the earth essence realm.</p><p>As long as he successfully comprehended the earth concept and broke through to the complete fourth-level, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase slightly. He would have more confidence in breaking out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Mountain and sea slash!”</p><p>Hai Yu roared. He had completely lost his patience. He exerted his combat strength to the maximum and was eager to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, he had returned to his human form. He held the giant axe, the Emperor spiritual weapon, and slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The main intent that Hai Yu had comprehended was the earth intent.</p><p>As the battle-ax slashed out, the terrifying pressure of the earth concept acted on Lu Ming’s body, as if it was going to break his body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed!</p><p>“I’ll use you to help me break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with ruthlessness. He controlled the lightning cauldron and charged at Hai Yu.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not choose to retreat. Instead, he fought head-on with Hai Yu.</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>Hai Yu was overjoyed when he saw Lu Ming charging at him. The power of the battleaxe in his hand increased a little.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The battle-ax collided with the lightning cauldron, causing a violent tremor.</p><p>A terrifying force gushed over. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>dandan, bubble, help me block those sea demons for now!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan and bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Pao Pao waved her hands and nodded repeatedly, indicating that there was no problem.</p><p>On the other hand, dandan was full of resentment. She mumbled and wanted Lu Ming to compensate her after the event.</p><p>However, dandan and bubbles were indeed worthy of being in the top 10. Although they had yet to fully mature, they were able to unleash their full strength and coordinate with each other. Their various techniques were extremely profound. Although they couldn’t defeat the flood Dragon sovereign, they were still able to delay him for a short while.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, was focused on the battle with Hai Yu.</p><p>He wanted to make use of the vast ocean to break through the earth essence realm.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming used the Thunder cauldron as a shield to block the opponent’s Emperor spiritual weapon and engaged in a great battle with Hai Yu.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage, Hai Yu could not kill Lu Ming in a short time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Soon, soon!”</p><p>With the help of Hai Yu’s earth concept and his own, Lu Ming felt that his understanding of the earth concept was deepening and he could make a breakthrough at any time.</p><p>earth, earth, all-encompassing, able to breed life, breed all things, inclusive of everything, profound and vast …</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was filled with thoughts.</p><p>At that moment, many figures appeared in the distance where Lu Ming and the rest were fighting.</p><p>They were all people who had entered this place. They looked from afar and saw that there were high-level spiritual God experts and Supreme-being experts.</p><p>At this moment, they were all extremely shocked.</p><p>“Is that Lu Ming’s combat strength? This is really shocking!”</p><p>isn’t the youth Champion a little too strong? even after Hai Yu and Supreme flood Dragon used their Emperor spiritual weapons, they still couldn’t take him down!</p><p>terrifying. It’s too terrifying. Moreover, Lu Ming’s two pets are also extremely terrifying!</p><p>The onlookers gasped in surprise and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Of course, there were also Supreme martial artists who had other ideas.</p><p>it seems like the cultivation method of the pure spirit body has fallen into Lu Ming’s hands. The stronger Lu Ming is, the better. It would be best if he, Hai Yu, and the others are both injured. Then, I can just sit back and reap the benefits!</p><p>Some Supreme martial artists thought.</p><p>In fact, this Supreme martial artist wasn’t the only one who thought this way. The other Supreme martial artists also thought the same way.</p><p>Each of these sovereigns had come in alone. At most, two of them would join forces. They were no match for Hai Yu or the flood Dragon sovereign. If the cultivation method of the pure spirit body fell into the hands of Hai Yu or the flood Dragon sovereign, they would have no hope at all.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming could fight with them and both of them would suffer, they would have a little hope.</p><p>“How is that possible? How could Lu Ming be so powerful? How can there be such a strong person in the younger generation? I can’t accept this!”</p><p>Hai Tian muttered to himself not far away. His eyes were filled with jealousy.</p><p>He was the most shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his imagination again and again.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, the ninth Island was packed with people.</p><p>Many Warriors who had low cultivation and couldn’t go deep into the sea were waiting here.</p><p>They couldn’t enter the bottom of the sea, so they just waited here to see if there was a cultivation method for pure spirit bodies and who could get it.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the space suddenly split open, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>It was an old man with gray hair, wearing a purple and gold robe. The moment he appeared, an earth-shattering aura spread out, making it difficult for people to breathe. It was as if a mountain was pressing on their bodies.</p><p>“The Emperor, it’s the Emperor!”</p><p>judging from the clothes, it’s the Emperor of the Sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion. The eldest young master of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, Hai Yu, is fighting in person. Now, even the Emperor is here!</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm as they looked at the elder in purple and gold with fear.</p><p>Even the Emperor had been mobilized.</p><p>After the old man in the purple-gold robe appeared, he looked around casually and then stood calmly in the void. He did not go to the bottom of the sea.</p><p>……</p><p>In the depths of the sea, in the ancient city, Lu Ming and Hai Yu exchanged a few more moves.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we have to think of a way to break out of the encirclement. We can’t hold on much longer!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and waved her claws. All kinds of inscriptions formed a large array in the air.</p><p>At the same time, dandan also displayed all kinds of martial arts techniques, all of which were extremely profound and dazzling.</p><p>“I’ll be done immediately!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Suddenly …</p><p>Among the five colored essences on his body, the khaki essence suddenly increased in power and surpassed the other four essences.</p><p>He had finally made a breakthrough in his earth will, and it had reached the full circle of level four.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s five intents had all reached the full circle of level four.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The five intents combined with the lightning cauldron clashed with Hai Yu. There was a loud boom and Lu Ming retreated, but this time, he retreated even less than before.</p><p>so what if I’ve broken through? I’ll still die!</p><p>Hai Yu bellowed and continued to charge at Lu Ming with his battle axe in hand.</p><p>dandan, bubble, alright, get ready to break out!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan and bubbles. He was prepared to let bubbles cast the space-time Tunnel and break out of the encirclement.</p><p>However, at this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
