They won’t be able to figure it out in a short time. I don’t have time to wait anymore. I might as well release a large number of maps. There are so many people, someone must be able to find it. I must find the cultivation method of the pure spirit body. This is my only hope!</p><p>The black-robed elder said in a cold voice. Then, a bunch of maps appeared in his hands. He took one out and opened it. It was exactly the same as the one Lu Ming had. It was a map of pure spirit bodies.</p><p>There were not just one or two pieces of the map. There were many pieces, and they were all copied by the black-robed elder.</p><p>A day later, another pure spirit body map appeared, which led to an intense fight. In the end, it was taken by a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>But after that, there were more and more maps regarding pure spirit bodies.</p><p>In the beginning, the competition was still very intense, and whenever a Supreme martial artist appeared, he would take action.</p><p>But later, it seemed that all the Supreme martial artists had appeared, and the map appeared, but only the spiritual God Realm Masters took action.</p><p>Later on, there were more and more maps. By a rough estimate, there were hundreds of maps.</p><p>Could the map be fake?</p><p>Such a situation made many people speculate.</p><p>Perhaps it was true. Someone had obtained the map first but couldn’t figure it out, so he threw out so many copies of the map. He wanted to use the power of others to find the cultivation method of a pure spirit body.</p><p>After that, such remarks were thrown out, causing many people to be skeptical.</p><p>However, no one would give up easily. After all, a pure spirit body was too tempting. Even if there was only a one in ten thousand chance, no one would give up.</p><p>Many people were holding the map and studying it carefully.</p><p>Later on, some people even joined together and started to study it.</p><p>A few days later, someone had indeed made some progress and flew out of the sea.</p><p>“The location indicated on the map should be overseas!”</p><p>Dandan also came to a conclusion.</p><p>In an instant, countless people gathered together and flew toward the ocean.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The sea breeze whistled and blew against their faces. When they arrived at the seaside, they could see the boundless ocean.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One figure after another rode the wind and broke through the waves, flying toward the ocean.</p><p>Some of them had extremely powerful auras and were extremely terrifying. They were all Supreme-being experts.</p><p>look, that’s Hai Tian! The sea suppressing Marshal has sent more experts!</p><p>Some people looked at the sky.</p><p>Everyone saw that there were a total of nine people on the edge of the sea and sky. All of them had terrifying and powerful auras, and they were all Supreme-beings.</p><p>However, this time, Hai Tian was not the leader. He followed behind a man in his forties with a respectful expression.</p><p>that’s Hai Tian’s big brother, Hai Yu. He’s a terrifying existence. It’s said that he has awakened a ninth level divine level bloodline. He’s already in his forties and can enter the Martial Emperor realm at any time. His combat strength is terrifying!</p><p>Hai Yu has also come out. With his combat strength, he can easily kill ordinary Supreme-beings!</p><p>Some people were discussing with fear when they mentioned Hai Yu.</p><p>a Supreme Being with a ninth level divine bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>A ninth level divine bloodline was absolutely terrifying. Such a person would definitely become an Emperor, and their battle prowess could not be measured with common sense.</p><p>Hai Yu, if he was not over thirty years old, he could participate in the selection of disciples of the tianshen sect.</p><p>It was easy to imagine how powerful a chosen like him would be once he reached the Paragon level.</p><p>Even Lu Ming might not be confident if he were to face them now.</p><p>Hai Yu, Hai Tian, and the others flew toward the ocean. Then, more and more people followed.</p><p>Lu Ming mixed in with the crowd and flew together.</p><p>After flying for an entire day, they had no idea how far they had traveled before a small island appeared in front of them.</p><p>“Could it be on this Island?”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>no, this Island is only the first location. It’s a point of reference!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>They had completely understood the map and the positions of the stars in the sky, and they were looking for the answer.</p><p>This Island was not the final destination. It pointed to the next location.</p><p>Some of them took out the map and studied it together. In the end, they found the right path and continued to fly overseas.</p><p>A day later, they found the second island.</p><p>Unfortunately, after some research, it was still not the final destination, but a guiding place.</p><p>By eliminating this Island, he could find the next location.</p><p>Everyone studied and calculated together before continuing to fly.</p><p>Another day passed, and they arrived at the third Island.</p><p>This Island was still not the final destination.</p><p>However, at this point, everyone encountered some difficulties.</p><p>They found a ruin on the island, all of which were abandoned stone pillars. Some people guessed that this was a key point in studying the map, but it seemed to be missing something, and they couldn’t figure out the final route.</p><p>there’s really something missing. The ruins should give us a hint!</p><p>Dandan frowned and pondered seriously.</p><p>Everyone studied it for an entire day, but they found nothing.</p><p>“These ruins are similar to the stone plate that was passed down in my family!”</p><p>At this moment, an old man walked into the ruins and took out a stone plate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone plate trembled and emitted light. At the same time, the ruins also trembled and emitted light.</p><p>The ruins and the stone plate resonated with each other.</p><p>“There’s a reaction!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Look, there are some routes!”</p><p>Everyone could see that the stone plate and the ruins were reacting to each other. As the light shone, some patterns were formed. These patterns seemed to be some kind of route.</p><p>Everyone hurriedly combined the route with the map and began to deduce.</p><p>“I got it, I found the route!”</p><p>Someone shouted in excitement.</p><p>In the end, everyone worked together to find the next route and continued to fly toward the ocean.</p><p>as expected, my choice was correct. I could only reach this far by myself!</p><p>In the crowd, an old man in a black robe had an excited expression on his face.</p><p>The old man was the one who had given him the map. He had obtained the map a long time ago, but after decades of research, he could only find the third Island. He had no idea what to do next.</p><p>Therefore, he had made a large number of copies of the map, hoping to find the method of the pure spirit body with the help of others.</p><p>Sure enough, this method worked. It had only been a few days, but the gains were greater than what he had gained from decades of research.</p><p>Then, they found the fourth island, and then the fifth Island …</p><p>Ten days later, the group found a total of nine islands.</p><p>The nine islands seemed to have a mysterious connection. They had to find one before they could find the next.</p><p>However, the ninth Island seemed to be the end.</p><p>Everyone studied it and discovered that the ninth Island was the last island. The next step would be to find the location of the pure spirit body cultivation technique.</p><p>Everyone was excited.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
