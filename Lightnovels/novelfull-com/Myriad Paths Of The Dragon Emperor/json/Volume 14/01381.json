He also stretched out his palm to grab Long Chen.</p><p>The two huge palms grabbed Long Chen at the same time, and their power exploded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying palm force landed on Long Chen’s body.</p><p>Although Long Chen’s Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline was abnormal and his combat strength had increased greatly, he was still far from being a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant roared and then collapsed, revealing Long Chen’s true body.</p><p>At that moment, Long Chen was extremely weak, and his eyes were filled with intense unwillingness.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite of his generation, but he ended up being manipulated by others. How could he be willing?</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he pondered about the possibility of saving her.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming shook his head and did not make a move.</p><p>There were too many powerhouses here. There were more than a dozen Lv 4 martial Royal realm powerhouses.</p><p>If he attacked, even if he could catch Long Chen by surprise and capture him, he would not be able to escape the pursuit of more than a dozen Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts. At that time, he would not be able to save anyone, but he would also be killed.</p><p>“Take long Chen away!”</p><p>The other experts all pounced toward Long Chen. Most of them were from the northern divine Palace.</p><p>As long as they could take long Chen away, they could break out of the encirclement.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The experts of the South God Palace would not give up so easily, and they also pounced toward Long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen was in the center of the storm, as if he would be torn apart at any moment.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a strange fluctuation spread out in the sky.</p><p>This fluctuation wasn’t very strong, but it enveloped the entire South God Palace as soon as it appeared.</p><p>A shocking scene happened.</p><p>All the people from the southern and northern divine palaces, including the experts in the fourth level martial Royal realm, who were in the middle of a great battle, seemed to have been frozen in the air.</p><p>Not only that, Lu Ming and the rest, as well as the entire South God Palace, seemed to have been frozen in place. They could not move at all.</p><p>Time and space seemed to have stopped at this moment.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked. He felt that the space around him had turned into a material substance and wrapped around him, making him unable to move at all. Even the mental energy fire in his sea of consciousness seemed to have frozen.</p><p>The rest of the people were similar to Lu Ming. Their eyes were filled with fear and disbelief.</p><p>“Hahaha, I didn’t expect to meet such a talent on this remote island!”</p><p>A loud laugh came from the sky. A burly old man as strong as an elephant leisurely stepped through the air and walked to Long Chen.</p><p>His small eyes were sizing up Long Chen.</p><p>he has actually awakened the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline. He’s just right to be the successor of my divine elephant sect. It’s really a waste of talent to stay on this wild island!</p><p>The burly old man reached out his hand, and a surge of energy poured into Long Chen’s body. All of a sudden, all of Long Chen’s injuries were healed.</p><p>Long Chen had also regained his freedom.</p><p>Long Chen looked at all the powerhouses who were frozen in the air in shock. His eyes were full of horror.</p><p>All of this was clearly the work of this burly old man!</p><p>He didn’t see how the old man made his move, but he was able to freeze so many experts in the air, and even countless people in the entire South God Palace. Such a method was simply unheard of and unimaginable.</p><p>kid, I’m the Grand Elder of the divine elephant sect in the yuan continent. How about you take me as your master? your bloodline can only be fully displayed in my sect!</p><p>The tall and sturdy old man said.</p><p>“Yuan continent’s divine elephant sect?”</p><p>Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. Without hesitation, he knelt down and said, ” “Disciple Long Chen greets master!”</p><p>This was obviously an unrivaled figure. If he didn’t acknowledge him as his master now, when would he?</p><p>As for Dragon God Valley, Long Chen had also heard that it seemed to have been destroyed.</p><p>“Haha, good, get up!”</p><p>The burly old man was overjoyed and laughed towards the sky. His long beard fluttered in the wind. After a while, he said,”Disciple, let’s go. Follow me back to the yuanlu continent!”</p><p>Without waiting for Long Chen’s reply, he waved his hand and disappeared with Long Chen.</p><p>As soon as the old man left, the pressure disappeared, and everyone regained their ability to move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as everyone regained their mobility, the South and North God palaces gathered together and looked at each other.</p><p>It was obvious that the tall and sturdy old man was a Supreme Almighty from the yuan continent. His strength was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>Moreover, their target, Long Chen, had already been taken away by this old man. He had even taken him in as a disciple. It could be said that they had used a wicker basket to draw water.</p><p>Since Long Chen was gone, there was no need for them to continue fighting.</p><p>“Wang Sheng, get lost to the North deity Palace!”</p><p>Someone coldly shouted.</p><p>Wang Sheng’s expression was unsightly. This time, the one who suffered the greatest loss was Wang Sheng, the Wang family.</p><p>Now, the Wang family and the southern deity Palace had already shed all pretenses of cordiality, so they could only move to the northern deity Palace.</p><p>Originally, if the North God Palace could seize Long Chen this time and enter the divine Ruins with the mixed energy token, the Wang family would have a share of the treasures they obtained, and they could even make up for it.</p><p>But now, Long Chen had not been captured. If they moved to the North God Palace, it would be a great loss.</p><p>After all, the Wang family had been in the South God Palace for countless years and was one of the top ten families. Moving to the North God Palace meant that they couldn’t enter the center of power in the North God Palace. The losses they would suffer were unimaginable.</p><p>Wang Sheng was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must take down that Lu Ming. Only then can I make up for my losses!”</p><p>Wang Sheng’s eyes flashed with a sinister look.</p><p>After that, the people of the North divine Palace left, and the battle ended.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming retreated silently.</p><p>What happened this time was beyond his expectations. However, it was a great fortune for Long Chen to be accepted as a disciple by a big sect in the yuanlu continent.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming’s second body met up with his main body.</p><p>Soon, the news that Long Chen had been taken in as a disciple by a Supreme Almighty of a major sect in the yuan continent and left the continent of the divine Ruins spread like wildfire.</p><p>After long Chen left, the remaining people naturally targeted Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was the only one left with the primordial chaos token.</p><p>North, South, East, West, the four divine palaces, and experts from other continents joined in the search for Lu Ming.</p><p>There were all kinds of means. Even if Lu Ming had the illusionary breath technique, he was almost discovered.</p><p>Another time, Lu Ming appeared to attract the attention of others and was besieged by a group of experts. He only managed to break out of the encirclement after a big battle.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in an area filled with demonic Qi and met up with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming, in a few months, there will be strong cultivators from the major sects of the yuanlu continent coming to pick us up. Although Dragon God Valley has been destroyed, you can come with me to the Tianyu demonic sect. I don’t think the people from the continent of the divine Ruins will dare to do anything to you!</p><p>Xie nianqing suggested.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. even so, I can protect myself. But I have not joined a major sect in the yuan continent. I have no power to deter the people from the divine Ruins. After I leave, some people might make a move on the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked, frowning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
