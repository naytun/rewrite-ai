Today is not only the day of your death, but also the day of Lu Ming’s death!</p><p>...</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming is also in your hands?”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang said in a deep voice, a little worried.</p><p>“Not really, but it’ll be soon!”</p><p>of course! the horse-faced Emperor smiled and continued, ” I heard that Lu Ming is a man who values friendship and loyalty. If he knows that you will be executed today, will he come to the holy city to save you? ” As long as he comes, he’ll be dead!”</p><p>“You guys … Despicable!”</p><p>despicable! You’re using us! Don’t even think about it!</p><p>When Xia Jiuyang, Bai Shijin, and the rest heard the horse-faced Emperor’s words, how could they not know the plot of the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace? they were clearly using them to lure Lu Ming here. They roared in anger.</p><p>“Scream, no matter how loudly you scream, it’s useless!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor sneered. Seeing the anxious looks on Xia Jiuyang and the others ‘faces, he felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>Whoosh! * Whoosh! *</p><p>In the distance, a series of violent air-rending sounds came from the distance. Before the sound even faded, figures had already appeared around them.</p><p>They were all from The Fiend clan. Their demonic Qi soared to the sky as they glared at horse-faced Emperor and the others with cold eyes.</p><p>The aura of these Mosha clan members was very terrifying. They were more powerful than any Mosha clan that Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>The one in the lead had a particularly burly body. His demonic Qi soared to the sky, and his vast demonic might was unfathomable.</p><p>The demon Emperor!</p><p>The leader of the group was a demon Emperor, the Emperor of the demon clan.</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor’s expression also changed.</p><p>“Mo Sha clan, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor shouted.</p><p>“To kill you, of course!”</p><p>The demon Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“You dare? Do you want to exterminate the entire clan?”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor shouted.</p><p>“Annihilate the entire clan? If your Xie clan could do it, my Mo Sha clan would have been exterminated a long time ago. Would you still be so kind as to spare us?”</p><p>The Emperor mocked.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this time, the sound of chains breaking came from under the volcanoes. Then, five powerful auras rushed out of five of the volcanoes. Then, five people rushed out of the volcanoes.</p><p>It was Xia Jiuyang and the others.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang’s body was burning like a sun. The terrifying power of flames caused the temperature in the surrounding tens of thousands of miles to rise rapidly.</p><p>“The Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Supreme Being of nine suns had actually broken through to the position of the Emperor. Now, he should be called the Emperor of nine suns.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It seemed that they were not trapped at all. They had rushed out of the volcano on their own.</p><p>“You guys … How did you escape?”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor was shocked.</p><p>of course it’s because of my help. Now, you can stay here!</p><p>The emperor’s voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Let’s go quickly and spread the news!”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor suddenly shouted and turned to leave.</p><p>“Stay!”</p><p>The Emperor had been staring at the horse-faced Emperor for a long time. As soon as the horse-faced Emperor moved, the devil Emperor moved as well. He clawed at the horse-faced Emperor with his sharp claws.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The rest of the mo Sha clansmen also charged towards the Xie clan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, Xia Jiuyang and the others also made their moves. Xia Jiuyang threw a punch, and his fist force was like a sun, blasting toward horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor was shocked and tried his best to Dodge. He did not dare to take it head-on. Xia Jiuyang’s punch made him tremble in fear.</p><p>At the same time, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other two also launched an attack on the Xie family.</p><p>Inscriptions appeared, and killing formations glowed. Bai Shijin and the other three attacked, and the void was filled with terrifying killing formations. A few people were killed in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reveal his true face immediately. Anyway, Xia Jiuyang and the others had the upper hand now. He was not in a hurry. His figure swayed randomly in the void, and he dodged some attacks silently.</p><p>“Nine yang divine fist!”</p><p>The flames on Xia Jiuyang’s body became more and more turbulent. Vaguely, there were even the shadows of nine suns that appeared around his body.</p><p>He threw a punch that was like the explosion of the sun, blocking all the horse-faced Emperor’s escape routes.</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor had no choice but to fight back.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow. The horse-faced Emperor’s body trembled and he retreated. He spat out a mouthful of blood. He was no match for Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>As soon as he retreated, the emperor’s attack arrived.</p><p>He could only try his best to resist.</p><p>As for the people that horse-faced Emperor had brought, they were constantly being killed, and none of them could escape.</p><p>“Escape, I must escape!”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor roared in his heart. His Zhen Yuan seemed to be burning. His domain covered his whole body, blocking Xia Jiuyang’s attack. Although he was hit and spat out a large mouthful of blood, and his body was almost burned, he successfully broke out of the encirclement with this attack, and flew crazily toward the exit of abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>“Not good, we can’t let him escape!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang hurriedly chased after him.</p><p>The demon Emperor of the Mosha clan also gave chase.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. His figure flashed and he disappeared from the crowd.</p><p>“Not good, one of them ran away!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and du songjue’s faces changed.</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor’s speed was astonishing. He was running for his life, so it could be said that he was performing exceptionally well.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had traveled a thousand miles.</p><p>However, before he could run 100000 miles, inscriptions suddenly flashed in front of him. A large array appeared, and eight huge chains appeared in the array, winding around the horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor’s expression changed. He struck at the chain, but when his attack landed on the chain, it only caused a vibration. It did not break the chain.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor was shocked.</p><p>Even he could not break it. This formation was clearly set up by an Emperor.</p><p>Why would another Emperor stop him?</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared in front of horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>“Zhao po, is that you? No, you’re not Zhao po!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor was stunned for a moment before he roared.</p><p>He was very familiar with Zhao po. It was impossible for him to set up a formation that even he could not break. This person was not Zhao po at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind them, Xia Jiuyang and the Emperor of the Mosha clan had already caught up.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor roared and wanted to rush over from the other side, but there was also a large array there. Chains crossed the sky and blocked the horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>At that moment, Xia Jiuyang and the Emperor of the Mosha clan had caught up and surrounded the horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>“Dammit! Who are you?”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor bellowed and glared at Lu Ming with murderous intent. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not stopped him, he would definitely have been able to escape.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang and the Emperor of the Mosha clan looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming with horse-face Emperor? He didn’t expect to be able to stop horse-faced Emperor. More surprisingly, he was able to block it. He was obviously an Emperor.</p><p>If they were enemies, it would not be good.</p><p>“Didn’t you just mention me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, the shape of his face started to change and he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>“You … You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Horse-face Emperor shouted in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
