This man is at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm!</p><p>let’s go, ” a sovereign said solemnly. The middle-aged man behind di Xian was a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie Luan, the old general, and the others released their auras. All the emperors of the Dragon Alliance gathered their auras and pressed down on di Xian and the others. Cold killing intent burst out of their bodies.</p><p>“How dare you kill people in Dragon Emperor City? all of you will be killed today!”</p><p>The old General’s voice was cold.</p><p>“No matter who you are, you will pay the price today!”</p><p>Xie Luan said. A terrifying blade light flickered on his body.</p><p>“Stay? The price? Hahaha, how laughable, ignorant, I’d like to see how you can make me stay today!”</p><p>Di Xian laughed and waved his hand.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Behind di Xian, auras burst out from the remaining people.</p><p>Each wisp of Qi was like a wisp of smoke. Each wisp of Qi was boundless and formed a powerful pressure, which pressed on the Imperial Dragon City and the hearts of the people.</p><p>The pupils of Xie Luan, the old general, and the others rapidly enlarged, revealing shock and disbelief.</p><p>The aura of these people was too strong.</p><p>Including the middle-aged man who had attacked earlier, there were a total of six people. All of them were at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>The other two had even more terrifying auras. They were much stronger than the peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Third level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>It was the aura of a Lv 3 Martial Emperor!</p><p>Six of them were at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm, and two of them were at the third level.</p><p>There was also a silver-haired old man who stood closely behind di Xian. He did not give off any aura, but the feeling he gave off was even more dangerous.</p><p>In Dragon Emperor City, everyone’s heart sank.</p><p>What kind of tremendous power was this?</p><p>Now, in the divine wilderness continent, the strongest was only at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm. Furthermore, there were only a few people who were at the peak of the realm.</p><p>Not a single one of them was at the third level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>But now, there were six peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts and two Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts behind di Xian. How could they fight?</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, aren’t you very arrogant? Today, the experts of my di family have arrived, and you will all die!”</p><p>Di Yi laughed. His eyes were full of ferocity and his voice was full of hatred.</p><p>Today, he wanted Lu Ming to suffer a fate worse than death!</p><p>Di Yi’s voice made many people tremble.</p><p>Could it be that the Dragon Alliance was going to be destroyed before it was officially established?</p><p>“Lu Ming, how is it? Hurry up and hand over the Emperor spiritual weapon and come here to admit your guilt. Maybe you can keep your dog life!”</p><p>Di Xian sneered and continued to look down at Lu Ming, as if he was certain that he would win.</p><p>Emperor spiritual weapons were the spiritual weapons that only peak Emperor experts could unleash their strongest power. Even to di Xian, they were precious. Those two Emperor spiritual weapons were one of the few he had.</p><p>Out of the nine experts he had brought, only one or two of them had an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>“Ming ‘er!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian and Li Ping looked at Lu Ming with worry.</p><p>“Father, mother, don’t worry. It’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. His smile was filled with confidence. For some reason, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping felt at ease when they saw Lu Ming’s smile.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming ignored di Xian and looked at Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi, you escaped last time. You should have hidden well. That way, you might have been able to survive. But you came here to die. You brought this on yourself!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke slowly, causing many people to be stunned.</p><p>In such a situation, Lu Ming was still thinking about killing Di Yi? He couldn’t even protect himself.</p><p>Only the eyes of a few people, such as Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and Yan kuangtu, lit up.</p><p>They knew Lu Ming very well. Lu Ming would not do anything without a reason.</p><p>Di Yi himself was also stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming still wanted to kill him under such circumstances? Where did Lu Ming’s confidence come from?</p><p>Di Xian’s face darkened.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to ignore him?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Di Xian stepped forward step by step, his body releasing a powerful aura.</p><p>Supreme martial artist!</p><p>Di Xian’s cultivation base was at the Supreme-being realm!</p><p>This shocked many people in Dragon Emperor City.</p><p>Because di Xian didn’t look very old. He was definitely not more than thirty years old. He might even only be in his early twenties.</p><p>To reach the Supreme level in his early twenties was too shocking. This had never happened before in the history of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve heard that you’re very powerful. I’d like to experience it today!”</p><p>Di Xian spoke, his aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>Behind di Xian, Di Yi’s eyes flickered, but he did not speak.</p><p>He knew that some of the Supreme talents in the Emperor family had shocking combat strength and were extremely terrifying. They were far from what some of the so-called Supreme talents in the continent of the divine Ruins could compare to.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was strong, he might be able to fight di Xian. Even if he could not fight di Xian, Lu Ming would offend di Xian even more and it would be beneficial to him.</p><p>“Not bad, do you dare to accept the challenge?”</p><p>Di Xian said.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for a beating, of course I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward, facing di Xian from a distance.</p><p>Lu Ming, I heard that you’re a rare genius in the divine wilderness continent, but I’ll let you know that the so-called geniuses of a desolate Island like yours are just a joke!</p><p>Di Xian sneered. His body started to shine like wisps of sword Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A combat sword appeared in di Xian’s hand. He strode toward Lu Ming and shouted, ” “Kill!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi split the sky and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and activated the prison suppressing heavenly technique.</p><p>The fist force and the sword Qi collided.</p><p>The space was twisted into pieces. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he actually took three steps back. Di Xian, on the other hand, stood still in the air.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>The Imperial Dragon City was filled with gasps.</p><p>Lu Ming was forced to retreat by a single sword?</p><p>In the battle of the holy city, everyone still remembered Lu Ming’s shocking combat strength. Even a peak second level Martial Emperor with an Emperor spiritual weapon was killed by Lu Ming. Now, Lu Ming was forced to retreat by a single sword. Moreover, the opponent was a young man who was not even thirty years old. This was shocking.</p><p>“His body?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was secretly shocked.</p><p>Although he had not used his full strength and had only revealed his cultivation at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm, he had still unleashed nine streams of dragon power and executed the prison suppressing heaven technique. Even an ordinary Emperor would not be a match for him. However, his opponent was only a Supreme-being, and the battle prowess he had unleashed was astonishing.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming the most was the body of the other party. It was a spirit body.</p><p>That’s right, the other party was only a Supreme martial artist, but he had a spiritual body. This was inconceivable.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense very clearly that the other party’s spirit body was not a pure spirit body like his. It was a real spirit body with special attributes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
