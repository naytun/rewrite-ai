One should know that in the divine Ruins ‘continent group, Lu Ming’s chaos sky-turning seal could injure a fourth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>In this place, Lu Ming was not even a match for the two brawny men at the early stage of the third level Martial Emperor realm, let alone the ones at the fourth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>...</p><p>Moreover, this was only an ordinary Martial Emperor. What if he encountered a heaven’s favorite? How strong would he be?</p><p>looks like I was really looking at the sky from the bottom of a well when I was trapped in a corner of the divine Ruins continent cluster in the past.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. While he felt the immense pressure, he was also filled with anticipation. His blood was boiling with excitement.</p><p>The yuan continent was the real stage. It was colorful and far from what the continents of the divine Ruins could compare to.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the two of them fought fiercely for hundreds of moves. In the end, both of them were injured and left the place.</p><p>However, after the two of them left, another two went up to fight.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming watched five battles in total, all of which were battles between Kings.</p><p>As expected, most of the emperors here had a much stronger combat strength than the emperors of the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>Lu Ming more or less had some idea.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying and the rest returned to their residence.</p><p>After returning to his residence, the first thing Lu Ming did was pour the life potion on his clone. As expected, the clone glowed and its recovery speed greatly increased.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to cultivate.</p><p>In the yuan continent, the cultivation of those below the Martial Emperor realm was too low.</p><p>Only by breaking through to the Emperor realm as soon as possible would he be able to gain a firm foothold.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Lu Ming came to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>During this period, Lu Ming would occasionally go out and buy some books to read. They were all about the yuan continent.</p><p>Since he was new, he naturally had to understand the world he was in.</p><p>On this day, the sound of drums suddenly rang out from outside.</p><p>It was the sound of a summoning drum. Someone was summoning them.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and went out of the cave abode. He saw long Yuanchuan standing in the valley.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Young men flew out of the ice caves and stood in the valley. There were more than a thousand of them.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that some of the youths who came with him were progressing very quickly. Some of them were originally at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, but now they had broken through and reached the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm, or even the perfected spiritual God Realm.</p><p>These people were the top geniuses of their respective continents, and their talents were definitely not weak. After coming here, they were naturally like fish in water, and their cultivation progress soared.</p><p>alright, you newcomers have been here for a month and have gotten used to it. Now, there are three months left before your assessment.</p><p>now, I’ll tell you the details of your assessment mission in three months. In three months, your assessment mission is to explore a secret realm!</p><p>Long Yuanchuan said.</p><p>“Explore a secret realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were stunned.</p><p>yes, only those who come out of the secret realm alive can be considered to have passed the test and become an official disciple of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Long Yuanchuan said.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed. It seemed that this secret realm was quite dangerous.</p><p>As if he could see through everyone’s thoughts, long Yuanchuan smiled and said, ” although this secret realm is dangerous, let me tell you, it’s also a Supreme opportunity. Many martial Royal realm experts and even Saints have tried to enter but failed.</p><p>“Because this mystical realm … It’s the great Emperor’s Secret realm!”</p><p>When he said the last sentence, long Yuanchuan deliberately emphasized it.</p><p>“What? The great Emperor’s Secret realm? The great emperor?”</p><p>Everyone, including Lu Ming, was stunned. They could not help but widen their eyes.</p><p>The great Emperor’s Secret realm? Could it be a secret realm left behind by the great emperor?</p><p>The great emperor was a peak expert of the primordial realm. He dominated the world and ruled the firmament.</p><p>What kind of treasures would there be in a secret realm left behind by such a person?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were burning.</p><p>Even Saints were unreachable existences to them, let alone a great emperor who was above Saints.</p><p>this is the first time that this great Emperor’s Secret realm has been discovered. After investigation, only those below the Emperor realm can enter. Those above the Emperor realm can’t enter. Even Saints can’t enter!</p><p>therefore, you must make good use of this time to raise your cultivation to the Supreme realm. According to the Saints ‘speculation, martial emperors and above are not allowed to enter the great emperor secret realm, but it will be no problem for you to break through after entering.</p><p>therefore, if some Supreme martial artists enter the great emperor secret realm to break through to the martial Royal realm, they will be able to gain the upper hand and obtain treasures!</p><p>also, this time, all of the top powers of the Azure continent will be sending people in. This is a dangerous place, so in the next three months, you guys should try your best to increase your strength!</p><p>“Opportunities are things that you have to grasp on your own!”</p><p>Long Yuanchuan continued to explain.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>After hearing this information, some of the doubts in Lu Ming’s heart were finally answered.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew why the Dragon God Valley, the deity sect, and other sects would cross endless distances to the continent of the divine Ruins to select disciples.</p><p>It was all because of the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>In every continent, they recruited heaven’s favorites to enter the Emperor’s secret realm.</p><p>The yuan continent was divided into many continents.</p><p>The Azure region was a large region in the southern part of the continent.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley was one of the most powerful forces in the Azure region.</p><p>The Azure continent was home to countless factions of varying sizes. However, there were a total of thirteen factions that stood at the very top of the continent.</p><p>These thirteen powers were the overlords of the Azure continent.</p><p>Dragon God Valley was one of the 13 forces.</p><p>Other than that, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, the jiuxiao sword sect, and even the Heavenly King Hall, which had caused chaos in the divine wilderness mainland because of a Heavenly King token, were all part of the 13 great powers.</p><p>This time, all the major forces would send people into the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>Therefore, these major forces all sent people to the small continents overseas to recruit disciples.</p><p>“The DI clan, if they’re not in the Azure continent, where are they?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>The yuan continent was too vast and the Azure continent was only a small part of it. The books that Lu Ming bought mostly introduced the Azure continent. He was not too sure about anything else outside of the Azure continent.</p><p>After the announcement, long Yuanchuan left the place. However, these young men couldn’t calm down.</p><p>After that, they all returned to their cave abodes and began cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>It was obvious that one could break through to the Emperor realm after entering the great emperor secret realm. Therefore, if they raised their cultivation to the limit of the Supreme-being realm and broke through to the Emperor realm after entering the great emperor secret realm, they would have an absolute advantage.</p><p>Lu Ming began to focus more on the embryonic form of the chaos realm.</p><p>Now, the primal Chaos Domain was getting closer and closer to its limit.</p><p>As long as the primal Chaos Domain was cultivated to its limit, he could begin to break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>On this day, there was a sudden violent boom outside. It was the sound of drums.</p><p>The summoning drum sounded again.</p><p>However, didn’t they just gather three days ago and announce the matter of the great Emperor’s Secret realm? Why are they gathering again?</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the cave abode with doubts in his mind.</p><p>Three young men stood outside the cave.</p><p>The three young men had a faint sense of pride on their faces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
