Before I leave, I have to make everyone tremble in fear. It’s best if I can kill all the sovereigns above the third level of the martial Royal realm. Only then can I ensure that the divine wilderness continent is safe. Only then can I go to the yuan continent in peace!</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes grew colder and colder. In the end, there was a flash of madness.</p><p>Kill! Lu Ming wanted to kill all the experts above the third level Martial Emperor realm on the divine Ruins continent. If others heard this, they would definitely think that he was crazy.</p><p>The entire continent of the divine Ruins was filled with experts. There were many Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts. How could Lu Ming kill them with his cultivation?</p><p>Even Xie nianqing was shocked by Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>right now, I’m no match for a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert. Therefore, I’ll need to cultivate in seclusion during this period of time. Also, when the time comes, I’ll set up a fatal formation in advance. There might be a chance!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He decided to take a gamble.</p><p>With his current combat strength, even if his main body and secondary body joined forces, he was not a match for a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>He needed to increase his strength!</p><p>After this period of cultivation, his pure spirit body had reached 90% completion and was only a step away from 100% completion.</p><p>As long as the pure spirit body reached perfection, its power would increase even more.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s strongest killing move was the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had already cultivated all five types of martial arts techniques to the sixth highest level.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had already begun to cultivate the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>As long as he could successfully cultivate the primal Chaos sky-turning seal, its power would be extremely astonishing.</p><p>At that time, he would be able to set up the killing formation in advance and kill the LV 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Xie nianqing knew that Lu Ming was a decisive person. Since he had already made up his mind, he would definitely do it. She did not say much but secretly decided to strengthen her cultivation and increase her strength so that she could help Lu Ming as soon as possible.</p><p>Now, there were still four months left before the two-year agreement with the major sects of the yuanlu continent.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming’s main body entered the mountain and river diagram. Xie nianqing kept the mountain and river diagram and turned around to enter the place filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>As for Ming Lian’s second body, he had left.</p><p>In the days that followed, Ming Lian would occasionally appear to attract the attention of others, but he would always disappear as soon as he appeared. He would hide his identity and inscribe inscriptions in a secret place, inscribing a killing formation.</p><p>As for the main body, it had always been cultivating arduously.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the second month of his closed-door cultivation, Xie nianqing’s cultivation broke through to the Supreme-being level.</p><p>Not long after Xie nianqing’s breakthrough, dandan and bubbles woke up one after another.</p><p>Furthermore, the aura that dandan and bubbles revealed when they woke up was extremely shocking.</p><p>They were both Emperor realm auras.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Dandan and bubbles were genuine top ten Battle Beasts with extremely terrifying combat strength. Although they had just broken through to the Emperor realm, their combat strength was hard to estimate.</p><p>When dandan heard that a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert was chasing after Lu Ming, she even declared that she would kill him with a single slap. She was extremely arrogant.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe it. After fighting with dandan, he realized that he was not her match at all.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, let’s see how you can be so arrogant in front of me in the future. In the future, you’d better listen to me obediently!”</p><p>Dandan was very proud of herself, with a pair of front claws behind her back.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The next moment, he was kicked over by bubble and rolled dozens of times on the ground.</p><p>“You, little guy, you dare to attack me …”</p><p>Dandan’s arrogance did not last for more than three seconds. She got up from the ground and glared at bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and looked at dandan with her dark eyes. The bubbles on the tip of her nose were one big and one small, as if she was telling dandan,’come at me if you have the ability.’</p><p>Dandan was fuming with anger, but bubbles was a space-time spirit mouse that could control space-time. He was really helpless against bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble cried out, curled up its body, and rolled around on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>sigh, it seems that I should give all the spiritual herbs to Papao in the future. He’s so obedient!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Dandan immediately cowered, revealed a flattering smile, and called out, ” “Lu Ming, don’t. I … No, I was just joking with you.”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored dandan. He looked into the distance and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.”Then this time, let’s make it bigger!”</p><p>Dandan’s battle strength was above his. She was definitely not weaker than the LV 4 martial Royal realm, or even stronger.</p><p>In addition to the bubbles ‘space-time concept, no, it should be the wonder of the space-time domain. Lu Ming planned to go all out.</p><p>After that, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>When there was still half a month before the arrival of the major sect emissaries, Lu Ming finally mastered the martial technique comprehended by the chaos, the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>“It’s time to act!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left the area and came to a huge Lake.</p><p>Previously, he had secretly carved a killing formation near the lake and spent several months to finally complete it.</p><p>This was a killing formation that had been passed down from a profound sky Saint, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>With the cultivation of the inscription clone, it took several months to complete the inscription, which showed its power.</p><p>“It’s time to spread the news!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, Ming Lian stepped into the air and left.</p><p>Not long after, an explosive piece of news spread throughout the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>Someone had discovered the place where Lu Ming had been secretly cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>Once this piece of news was released, the divine Ruins continent was in an uproar.</p><p>“Let’s go and capture Lu Ming!”</p><p>“This time, we can’t let him escape!”</p><p>“Seal that part of the world!”</p><p>The experts spoke one after another. The southern divine Palace, Northern divine Palace, Eastern divine Palace, Western divine Palace, and the blood Sun continent, which was ranked second and third, and so on.</p><p>Countless experts gathered at the lake where Lu Ming was.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged on the surface of the lake. At this moment, he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“They’re here?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Si la! “Hiss!”</p><p>The space around them cracked continuously, and one figure after another stepped out of the space.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying aura spread out.</p><p>Powerhouses were all powerhouses, and even the worst of them were martial emperors.</p><p>There were more than five hundred people.</p><p>This was a shocking number. There were more than 500 emperors.</p><p>All four divine palaces had come, along with some experts from other continents.</p><p>Lu Ming was surrounded by people. The space seemed to have frozen. Lu Ming did not have the slightest chance of escaping.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where can you run to?”</p><p>From the North, a person spoke, but it was Wang Sheng.</p><p>“Who said I’m running?”</p><p>Lu Ming got up and stood on the lake, looking around coldly.</p><p>Most of the third level martial Royal realm powerhouses in the divine Ruins ‘continent group had arrived, right?</p><p>“You’re not running? Hehe, it seems like he knows he can’t escape!”</p><p>Wang Sheng sneered.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and directly ignored Wang Sheng. His eyes swept across the room and his voice was heard, You guys coming here is nothing more than wanting the primordial chaos token to enter the divine Ruins and obtain treasures, that’s all!</p><p>I can tell you all that the divine Ruins ‘core indeed has countless treasures!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
