Go down and accompany your two nephews!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard as the prison-suppressing stele flew towards the green-haired middle-aged man.</p><p>Lu Ming, I am the second brother of the sea suppressing Marshal. If you dare to kill me, the entire divine wilderness continent will be buried with you!</p><p>The Azure-haired man roared threateningly.</p><p>“I’ve already killed Hai Tian and Hai Yu. You’re not one of them!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You … Let me tell you, I’m not only a member of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, I’m also an elder of the South God Palace. If you kill me, you’ll be going against the South God Palace!”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man continued to shout. Seeing that the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion was not going well, he moved out of the South God Palace.</p><p>“South God Palace? I will make a trip there sooner or later!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was still as cold as a knife.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man was already panicking.</p><p>Lu Ming was not threatened at all. He was extremely bold. He had never met such a person.</p><p>He was at a loss.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In his panic, a Phoenix Feather flying sword flew past his neck, leaving a bloody mark and almost chopping his head off.</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man shivered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I beg you to spare me. As long as you let me go, I’ll definitely plead for you in front of big brother when I return. I’ll beg him to let you off!”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man started to beg for mercy when he saw that threats didn’t work.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Let me go, I beg you. As long as you let me go, I’ll just be your slave …”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man became more and more afraid. In the end, he didn’t care about his face anymore and begged bitterly. He didn’t look like a high and mighty Emperor at all.</p><p>Emperors were also humans. They were just people who had great power. They also had seven emotions and six desires, and they were also afraid of death.</p><p>Emperors, in particular, were more afraid of death than ordinary people.</p><p>They had great power and could destroy the world. They had long lifespans and could live freely in the world. What kind of enjoyment was that?</p><p>Therefore, they were even more afraid of death.</p><p>Clearly, the green-haired middle-aged man was such a person.</p><p>When he was stronger than others, he was high and mighty, looking down on others as if they were ants. But once he faced the threat of death, he often acted worse than ordinary people.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was unmoved. He said coldly and pressed the prison-suppressing stele down. At the same time, he attacked with his second body.</p><p>The result was already without any suspense.</p><p>Although the green-haired middle-aged man’s cultivation had reached the peak of the third level martial Royal realm, how could he be a match for Lu Ming’s main body and second body when they joined forces?</p><p>Not long after, the green-haired middle-aged man was killed by Lu Ming, unwilling to accept the outcome.</p><p>At this point, more than 20 powerhouses at the second level martial Royal realm and above were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>These twenty-odd experts, in addition to the five that Lu Ming had killed in the Imperial Dragon City, could be said to be the peak experts of all the continents in the southern part of the continent cluster of the divine Ruins.</p><p>In this battle, the peak experts of these continents had suffered heavy losses, and there would be a period of void. The situation of these continents would also change greatly, and there would probably be a shocking war between many forces.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming could not be bothered with all these.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, more than twenty storage rings were put away by Lu Ming.</p><p>Also, the bodies of more than 20 emperors had all been put into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>These were all emperors, and both their blood and essence were priceless treasures. Xie Luan and the others would be able to put them to great use.</p><p>After putting it away, Lu Ming headed towards the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>Outside the Imperial Dragon City, more than ten figures were waiting anxiously.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the others.</p><p>They were all the higher-ups of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming’s combat strength was powerful and he had created miracles time and time again, they could not help but worry when they were facing powerhouses from many other continents.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing’s eyes lit up and he looked forward.</p><p>A rainbow light flashed and Lu Ming’s figure appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing quickly stepped forward, full of worry.</p><p>During this period of time, Xie nianqing had been in seclusion to break through to the Supreme-being realm. However, when he heard the news, he immediately came out of seclusion.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alliance master, how are the experts from the other continents?”</p><p>Xie Luan asked.</p><p>The others also looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a wave of his hand, the dead bodies of the sovereigns, complete or incomplete, appeared in the air, emitting shocking fluctuations.</p><p>Even after death, an Emperor’s body would still emit extremely shocking fluctuations.</p><p>“This … What is this?”</p><p>Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the other emperors were all petrified.</p><p>These emperors had died not long ago, and they could clearly sense their cultivation base from their corpses.</p><p>All of them were at the second level martial Royal realm and above. There were as many as five of them at the third level martial Royal realm.</p><p>So many experts had died.</p><p>It was obvious that he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Their hearts were twitching, and they were gasping.</p><p>At the same time, they could not see through Lu Ming anymore.</p><p>you can keep these corpses. You can plan how to use them!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>Xie Luan and the others put away the Emperor corpses in a storage ring.</p><p>also, I’ll keep the storage rings of the emperors that are useful to me. As for the useless ones, I’ll give them to you and store them in the Treasury. I’ll reward you according to your contributions in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie Luan and the others nodded.</p><p>Then, they all bade farewell and left.</p><p>Only Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were left in the sky.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>Xie nianqing suddenly asked.</p><p>“Little Qing, I still can’t hide it from you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He held Xie nianqing’s hand and gazed into the depths of the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>after this battle, although the continents in the South of the divine Ruins have suffered heavy losses, this matter will not end just because of this!</p><p>behind me are the experts from the four great divine palaces of the divine Ruins continent, as well as the experts from the continents in the West, North, and East of the divine Ruins continent. These experts will also rush over later. If I continue to stay in the divine wilderness continent, it will be a disaster for the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Lu Ming said solemnly.</p><p>The strongest person who appeared now was only at the peak of the third level Martial Emperor realm. If a fourth level Martial Emperor appeared later, how would Lu Ming deal with it?</p><p>The fourth level Martial Emperor realm was much stronger than the third level.</p><p>Although it was not difficult for Lu Ming to kill an ordinary peak Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert with the help of his main body and secondary body, he was not a match for a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>If a fourth level martial Royal realm expert came to the divine wilderness continent, the Dragon Alliance, the Imperial Dragon City, and even the entire divine wilderness continent would be in trouble.</p><p>This was not what Lu Ming wanted to see.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re leaving the divine wilderness continent? Head to the continent of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked. She seemed to have guessed Lu Ming’s thoughts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
