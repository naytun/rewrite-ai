However, Mu Lan and the two black-robed men’s cultivation levels were far above his, so he could not interfere at all.</p><p>“Mu Tian, you should worry about yourself!”</p><p>Saber Heng sneered and charged at mu Tian.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in today’s battle. As long as the two black-robed men could take down Mu Lan, it would be easy to deal with the others.</p><p>As the battle continued, the situation became more and more disadvantageous for Tianxuan city. Mu Lan was slowly falling into a disadvantageous position.</p><p>“Hehe, this little girl is really beautiful. I’ve lived for so many years, but I’ve never seen such an alluring woman!”</p><p>The second black-robed man sneered. His attacks were like a violent storm, pouring down on Mu Lan. Mu Lan was panting heavily and sweating profusely. She couldn’t hold on much longer.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, an extremely terrifying aura suddenly descended from the sky.</p><p>This aura was like the ruler of the universe, vast and unfathomable, like the abyss and the sea.</p><p>A terrifying pressure instantly enveloped the entire Tianxuan city.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Everyone from the black knife region, including Dao Heng and the two black-robed men, let out a blood-curdling screech. It was as if they had been hit by hundreds of mountains, and blood spurted out of their mouths.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that mu Tian, Mu Lan, and the rest of the Tianxuan city people were completely fine.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Everyone looked up into the sky and discovered that there was a blurry figure in the distant sky. It was shrouded in a Halo, like a god in the sky.</p><p>“He’s the one …”</p><p>Mu Lan’s expression changed. A complicated look flashed across her eyes. She bit her lip and flew down, disappearing from Tianxuan city.</p><p>“Then … Who was that? So strong! He’s too strong!”</p><p>“A heavenly deity?”</p><p>The martialists of Tianxuan city looked up at the sky and spoke with dazed expressions.</p><p>That aura made them look up to it and worship it.</p><p>However, the aura only appeared for a very short time. As soon as it appeared, it was immediately retracted and disappeared.</p><p>Then, the figure in the sky descended.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>Mu Tian was the first to exclaim when he saw the figure.</p><p>Yes, the figure that had suddenly appeared was Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, as soon as he arrived at Tianxuan city, he found that there was a great battle going on there. In a fit of anger, he released his aura and injured the black-robed man and the people from the black knife region.</p><p>He had been merciful. Otherwise, the black-robed man and the others would have been reduced to ashes under Lu Ming’s aura. Not even a trace of them would have been left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really you!”</p><p>Mu Zheng saw Lu Ming and flew over.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is back. Oh my God, that terrifying aura just now was actually emitted by Lu Ming. What realm has Lu Ming reached now?”</p><p>The rest of the people in Tianxuan city exclaimed in disbelief when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>They could not believe that the god-like aura just now was emitted by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at mu Zheng and mu Tian.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why did you come back so suddenly?”</p><p>Mu Zheng was extremely happy to see Lu Ming.</p><p>“The Dragon Alliance is currently taking over the territory and forces of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. I happened to be in ninedragons before, so I came back to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, huh? What? The Dragon Alliance!”</p><p>Mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the others started to nod. They suddenly thought of something and exclaimed.</p><p>Mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the rest looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Lu … ‘Lu Ming. I heard that there was a world-shaking war in the holy city of the central continent. The one who dominated the war was called Lu Ming. Also, the Dragon Alliance has swept the world. I heard that the leader of the Dragon Alliance is called Lu Ming. Then …’ Was it … You?”</p><p>Mu Tian stammered as he spoke.</p><p>Mu Yi, mu Zheng, and the rest were also staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cough, cough, that was indeed me!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed dryly.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the others gasped and were stunned.</p><p>Even though they had such a guess before, they still found it hard to believe after it was confirmed. It was as if they were dreaming.</p><p>The Alliance master of the Dragon Alliance, the Overlord of the divine wilderness continent, was actually Lu Ming, the Lu Ming who had come from the Tianxuan region.</p><p>It was too shocking.</p><p>They were stunned for a moment before they reacted. Then, they were overjoyed.</p><p>They were certain that it was Lu Ming.</p><p>That was because the aura that Lu Ming had just released was too shocking. He was like a god, like the master of the world. Compared to him, they were simply ants, or even worse.</p><p>However, one of them had a complicated look in his eyes. He was filled with anxiety.</p><p>That was mu Yi.</p><p>In the past, he had targeted Lu Ming in every way. Now, if Lu Ming wanted to settle the score with him …</p><p>He didn’t dare to continue thinking.</p><p>“Seniors, let’s take a look at these people first!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and sucked with his palm. The two black-robed men and Dao Heng were sucked over.</p><p>“Spare me, Lu Ming, no, Alliance Master Lu, spare me!”</p><p>Dao Heng shouted in shock.</p><p>The two black-robed men were also trembling and begging for mercy.</p><p>They had also heard the conversation between Lu Ming and the group just now. They were almost scared to death.</p><p>This young man who had suddenly appeared was the newly established Alliance master of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Why would such an important figure suddenly appear in the tiny Tianxuan city? it seemed like he was acquainted with mu Tian and the others. Dao Heng and the others thought that they were dreaming, a terrible nightmare.</p><p>“Speak! Who ordered you to do this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold as he berated them. Dao Heng and the rest were so frightened that they trembled all over.</p><p>It was obvious that there was someone else behind the two black-robed men.</p><p>“It’s the blood Vulture sect. We’re disciples of the blood Vulture sect. The blood Vulture sect wants to take advantage of the destruction of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to secretly plunder a batch of treasures and strengthen their strength!”</p><p>The black-robed man who appeared first called out and told everything, not daring to hide anything.</p><p>“So it’s the blood Vulture sect!”</p><p>Mu Tian’s expression changed.</p><p>The blood Ridge sect was the most powerful force in the surrounding dozens of large domains. It was said that it had a spiritual God expert. In the past, it had always relied on the Emperor heaven divine Palace and was a subsidiary sect of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Now that the news of the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s destruction had spread, the blood Ridge sect could no longer sit still and wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to make a fortune.</p><p>“The blood Ridge sect no longer needs to exist!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge crack appeared in the space under Lu Ming’s palm, revealing a pitch-black void passage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space passage trembled. Everyone could see that the other side of the space passage also cracked open, revealing an incomparably majestic mountain. Blood mist permeated the mountain.</p><p>The blood Ridge sect. This was the blood Ridge sect.</p><p>He!</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he flipped his hand and pressed down. Everyone watched in horror as a huge palm formed above the blood Ridge sect. It covered the sky and pressed down on the blood Ridge sect.</p><p>One after another, figures from the blood Ridge sect flew out of the giant mountain in fear, trying to escape. However, they all collapsed under the palm, their bodies and souls destroyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
