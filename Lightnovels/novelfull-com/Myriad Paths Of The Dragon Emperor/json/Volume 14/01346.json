He had many mysterious and unpredictable techniques. That was why di Yi had launched a sneak attack. Even so, Lian Cang had left a trace of his imprint and escaped into the ground. The all formation illustration was severely damaged.</p><p>...</p><p>Over the years, Ming Lian’s clone had been cultivating hard in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. At the same time, with the improvement of his cultivation, he had also repaired the all formation diagram. Now, the all formation diagram had been repaired by eighty to ninety percent. Under the control of the clone, its power was amazing.</p><p>Minglian’s second body already had the combat strength of a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert. With the five Phoenix Feather flying swords, it was even more powerful. Now that he had taken out the all formation picture, his combat strength was almost the same as Di Yi’s.</p><p>Di Yi could only focus all his attention on dealing with Ming Lian’s clone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele shook and suppressed Di Yi.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Di Yi roared in his heart. He split a part of his mind to resist Lu Ming’s main body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele weighed hundreds of millions of pounds, which made Di Yi’s body shake. At the same time, Ming Lian’s second body seized the opportunity to launch a storm of attacks.</p><p>“Get sleepy!”</p><p>There were at least 100 trapping formations in the formation picture. They all tried to trap Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi shouted angrily and tried his best to fight. Unfortunately, he was at a disadvantage in the end.</p><p>After the Ming Lian clone took out the all formations diagram, the combat power of the main body and the clone had surpassed Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi tried his best to resist, but after dozens of moves, he was completely suppressed and had almost no power to fight back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Five Phoenix Feather flying swords pierced through the void. They were so fast that even ordinary emperors could not see them clearly. They were aimed at Di Yi’s five vital points.</p><p>Di Yi wielded his sword to block it. Although he managed to block it, the prison-guarding stele pressed down again. Di Yi shouted angrily and could only cover his body with his territory and vital essence.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The realm and genuine vitality shook violently and were destroyed by the prison-suppressing stele. Di Yi’s body shook violently. Even though he had cultivated the spirit body of ten thousand meridians, he could not withstand it. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Di Yi’s myriad meridians spirit body was very terrifying. If he cultivated it to perfection, its power would be amazing. Unfortunately, he had not cultivated it perfectly and had not completely succeeded. Therefore, he had always wanted to get Lu Ming’s nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>“Di Yi is injured!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>Di Yi was injured and he was not Lu Ming’s match. Was the winner going to be decided this time?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Di Yi was injured. Lu Ming launched an even more intense attack.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A Phoenix Feather flying sword almost pierced through Di Yi’s heart and went through his shoulder, bringing out a stream of blood.</p><p>Di Yi’s face turned even paler. Although the Phoenix Feather flying sword did not hit his vital parts, the terrible sword Qi and destructive power still made him more seriously injured.</p><p>The more serious his injuries were, the more difficult it would be for him to resist Lu Ming.</p><p>Under the pressure of the prison-suppressing stele, he spat out a mouthful of blood, staggered, and his breath was weak.</p><p>“I’m sleepy!”</p><p>The second body shouted, and the all formations diagram glowed. Large formations emerged one after another, enveloping Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi roared and tried his best to fight back, but this time, he could not rush out.</p><p>On his body, all kinds of true dragons and phoenixes were trembling, as if they would collapse at any moment.</p><p>Di Yi, today is the day you die!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice came from the prison defending monument’s bloodline.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a Dragon’s Roar, the nine Dragon bloodline flew out of the prison-suppressing stele. It opened its mouth and roared. The devouring power burst out and enveloped Di Yi and Martial Emperor.</p><p>nine dragon blood essence, strip!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and his devouring power increased rapidly.</p><p>One of the unusual signs on Di Yi’s body was a nine Dragon. At this time, the nine Dragons were swallowed by the devouring power and involuntarily flew to the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to take away a drop of Nine Dragons Blood essence from Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi tried his best to resist.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Five Phoenix Feather flying swords shot out. Di Yi blocked four of them, but he was stabbed by one, which almost cut off half of his body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this time, the nine Dragon bloodline roared. The nine Dragon phenomenon on Di Yi’s body flew toward the nine Dragon bloodline. At the same time, a drop of blood essence appeared on Di Yi’s body. The Dragon roared and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The blood essence of the nine Dragons was extracted.</p><p>Di Yi was unwilling, but he could only watch helplessly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The blood essence of the nine Dragons flew into the mouths of the nine Dragons and disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons let out a shocking roar as if it was very satisfied, and its aura bloomed.</p><p>“Xie Qitian, if you don’t make a move now, when will you?”</p><p>Suddenly, Di Yi let out an angry roar.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Nine Heavens bronze man, come out!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s loud voice came from the sky.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>As soon as Xie Qitian’s voice fell, violent tremors suddenly came from nine different directions in the sacred city. Nine powerful auras soared into the sky.</p><p>Then, everyone saw nine golden rays of light rush up and fly into the sky.</p><p>“That’s a bronze man!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw that the nine beams of light were clearly nine bronze men. They were golden all over and cast in brass. They were more than three meters tall and dense inscriptions appeared on their bodies.</p><p>Their auras were extremely powerful, and each of them was an Emperor, equivalent to a first level Martial Emperor.</p><p>The nine bronze men flew up into the sky and joined the battle, forcing the nine sovereigns back.</p><p>“Combine with the bronze man!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s voice was heard again.</p><p>At this moment, from the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, nine sovereigns flew towards the nine bronze men. It was as though they were performing a bloodline fusion. The nine sovereigns directly fused into the bronze men and disappeared.</p><p>The auras of the nine bronze men began to rise rapidly.</p><p>He broke through the LV 1 martial Royal realm and stepped into the LV 2 martial Royal realm. He continued to improve until he reached the peak of the LV 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Peak of the second level martial Royal realm, nine peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>……</p><p>The nine bronze men roared and charged towards the heaven suppressing divine Army and the Emperor of Northern Plains.</p><p>A peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert was too powerful. An ordinary Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert would not be able to resist him.</p><p>Instantly, screams were heard. Lu Ming saw that five sovereigns were killed in an instant.</p><p>On the side of Northern Plains, there were mountain breaking Martial Emperor, heavenly wind Martial Emperor, and the heaven suppressing divine Army was even worse off, three martial emperors were killed at once.</p><p>Five martial Royal realm experts were killed just like that.</p><p>The other four bronze men were blocked by tu Qian, Xia Jiuyang, and the baizhan Martial Emperor. Otherwise, the losses would have been even greater.</p><p>“Not good! That’s the nine Heavens bronze man of the Xie clan! The nine Heavens bronze man of the Xie clan is still here!”</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Legion and Northern Plains ‘experts all shouted in fear.</p><p>It was said that when the ancient Saint dynasty was first established, the first Saint Emperor had gathered all the experts in the world and used countless precious materials to create nine bronze men. Each bronze man was extremely mysterious and powerful.</p><p>However, it was said that the nine bronze men of the Xie clan had been destroyed in countless Wars over the years. It was unexpected that they were still here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
