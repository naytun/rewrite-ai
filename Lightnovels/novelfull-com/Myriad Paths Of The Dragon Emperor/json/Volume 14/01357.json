Then, he looked to the East.</p><p>...</p><p>There was a place that he had to visit, and that was the remains of Nine Dragons.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had refined the drop of Nine Dragons ‘blood essence that he had obtained from Di Yi and integrated it into the blood of the nine Dragons. He had obtained more memory fragments of the nine Dragons.</p><p>It was time to go to the ruins of Nine Dragons.</p><p>He took a step forward and the space cracked automatically. Lu Ming’s figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The relic of the nine Dragons was located at the border between the East barren and the central continent, in the chaotic area.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure appeared in the chaotic realm silently and headed toward the nine Dragons ruins.</p><p>As Lu Ming flew, the area in front of him became more and more desolate. There was not a single blade of grass in the vast mountains. It was a barren land, as if all the vitality had been devoured by something.</p><p>Further ahead, the Lonely Mountain turned into a desert, even more deathly silent.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the center of the desert, he saw a cave.</p><p>It was an unfathomably deep cave, pitch-black, and it led to the depths of the earth.</p><p>At the edge of the cave, there was a dark yellow stone tablet with a line of words written on it: Those above the Emperor level would die if they entered!</p><p>Each word was filled with killing intent. It was as if there was a terrifying killing intent in them, making people feel cold all over.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>There had always been a legend that no one above the Emperor level could enter the ruins of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Entering meant death!</p><p>That was why Martial Emperor Di Yi didn’t dare to enter himself, but let nine suns Supreme enter.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and he appeared next to her.</p><p>The second body had already broken through to the Emperor realm and could not enter.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body did not hesitate and rushed into the dark cave. As soon as he entered, a terrifying force came from the cave, causing Lu Ming’s body to sink as if he was carrying tens of thousands of mountains on his back.</p><p>Moreover, the speed of his descent was getting faster and faster.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>In Lu Ming’s body, the essential core burst forth to resist the force. Although there was some effect, the effect was not very good. It was just that the speed of decline had slowed down a little.</p><p>It was only when Lu Ming used the chaos concept that he was able to resist the force and control his body freely.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled himself and descended at an even speed.</p><p>The cave was unfathomably deep. Lu Ming could feel that he had descended a few hundred miles but he was still going deeper.</p><p>Moreover, at the edge of the cave, Lu Ming felt a terrifying murderous intent more than once. It was as if a wave of energy swept across his body and then retracted.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that if his cultivation level surpassed the Emperor level, he would be attacked.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that he had finally reached the bottom after descending for about a thousand miles.</p><p>With a sweep of his gaze, the bottom of the cave was covered in a thick layer of bones.</p><p>Some of the bones were crystal clear, as if they were made of fine jade.</p><p>Some of the bones were golden as if they were made of gold. It was easy to imagine that the owners of these bones must have been extremely powerful people, or even emperors, but they were buried here in the end.</p><p>One could imagine how dangerous the nine Dragon ruins was.</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the ground of the cave and still felt a strong pressure. His movements were greatly affected. His movements slowed down and it became difficult for him to fly.</p><p>In front of the cave, there was a straight cave that was still dark.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and walked a hundred meters with each step. He passed by the skeletons and walked towards the cave ahead.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>But before he could go far, a Dragon’s Roar sounded.</p><p>A Blood Dragon that seemed to be formed from blood mist pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“A true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. This Blood Dragon had five dragon claws on its abdomen. It was a five-clawed true dragon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The five-clawed Blood Dragon pounced at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Supreme martial artist!</p><p>This five-clawed Blood Dragon had the combat strength of a Supreme-being.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on the blood dragon’s claw. The powerful force crushed the blood dragon’s claw. Then, the fist force crushed the blood Dragon’s body and it collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>He had just walked about a thousand meters when another Dragon’s Roar was heard. This time, there were two.</p><p>Two five-clawed Blood Dragons appeared and charged toward Lu Ming. They were also at the Supreme-being level.</p><p>Naturally, it was easily defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward, but not long after, three Blood Dragons appeared. As he continued, more and more Blood Dragons appeared.</p><p>In the end, nine five-clawed Blood Dragons appeared together.</p><p>It was equivalent to nine Supremes besieging Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, it was not difficult for him to defeat them one by one.</p><p>However, after passing through the siege of the nine Blood Dragons, Lu Ming was attacked again when he continued to move forward.</p><p>This time, only three Blood Dragons appeared.</p><p>However, the difference was that each of the three Blood Dragons had six dragon claws on their abdomens.</p><p>The combat strength of a six-clawed Blood Dragon was much higher than a five-clawed Blood Dragon.</p><p>However, they were still no match for Lu Ming. As Lu Ming charged through, the number of six-clawed Blood Dragons increased.</p><p>After Lu Ming broke through the siege of nine six-clawed Blood Dragons, another seven-clawed Blood Dragon appeared.</p><p>The difficulty level was getting higher and higher.</p><p>Lu Ming arrived at an underground stone room after he passed through nine Blood Dragons with seven claws.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were a few boxes in the stone room. However, the boxes had been opened and there was nothing inside.</p><p>“This Must Be the Place senior Jiuyang came to in the past!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had asked Xia Jiuyang about the nine Dragon ruins before, and Xia Jiuyang had told him in detail.</p><p>Back then, Xia Jiuyang had passed through nine seven-clawed Blood Dragons to come to this stone chamber.</p><p>The two drops of nine dragon blood essence, the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, and the true war Dragon technique Foundation establishment chapter were all obtained from here. They were all placed in these boxes.</p><p>Back then, the nine suns Supreme had reached his limit. If he continued, he would have to face the eight-clawed Blood Dragon, whose combat strength was even more amazing. Xia Jiuyang was no match for him at all.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and walked to the cave in front of the stone room.</p><p>As expected, the blood Dragons that appeared in front of him each had eight dragon claws and shocking combat strength.</p><p>The combat strength of one was equivalent to a human Supreme who had awakened a ninth level divine bloodline. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, it still could not stop Lu Ming. Lu Ming continued to pass through the levels.</p><p>After defeating the nine eight-clawed Blood Dragons, a deafening Dragon’s Roar was heard. A gigantic nine-clawed Dragon appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, it was Nine Dragons, Nine Dragons with nine dragon claws.</p><p>Although his aura was also at the Supreme-being level, Lu Ming felt that he was extremely dangerous.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head and he transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two Nine Dragons pounced on each other.</p><p>The nine Dragons here were so powerful that even an ordinary martial Royal realm expert would not be their match. They were at least equivalent to a second level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was not his match. He only started to suppress his opponent after he cast the chaos will.</p><p>one of them is already so strong. If there are more, or even nine of them, how can we fight them? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
