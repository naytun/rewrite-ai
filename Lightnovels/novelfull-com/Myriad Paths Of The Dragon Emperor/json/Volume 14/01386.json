Lu Ming rushed into the void channel and appeared thousands of miles away, avoiding the attack.</p><p>don’t stop, continue to pursue him. No matter how heaven-defying his pet is, it can’t use that kind of technique continuously. It’ll exhaust its energy!</p><p>“He can’t escape!”</p><p>One after another, the Overlord figures called out to the crowd to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>They had to kill Lu Ming today. Otherwise, if Lu Ming escaped, they would not be able to gather together every day. They had to split up. Once they split up, it would be more dangerous to face Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>Therefore, he had to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots today!</p><p>They chased after Lu Ming tightly.</p><p>Lu Ming flew forward at high speed.</p><p>After flying for a million miles, Lu Ming suddenly stopped. He turned around and looked at the experts who were chasing after him. The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Seeing that the experts were slowly approaching, Ming Lian appeared. The mental energy fire between his eyebrows jumped and he shouted, ” “Rise!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In the void, countless inscriptions appeared, and a huge array appeared in the sky.</p><p>This formation covered a radius of 30000 miles, and everyone was trapped inside.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s killing move!</p><p>Lu Ming’s ultimate killing formation was not inscribed at the lake, but here. The lake was just a bait, and so was he.</p><p>He knew that the cultivators of the four divine palaces wouldn’t be fooled easily. Everything he had done before was for this moment, to lure these people here.</p><p>“Not good, I’ve been tricked!”</p><p>“There’s a killing formation here!”</p><p>“Hurry up and charge out!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>it’s too late. God-killing sword formation, kill!</p><p>Ming Lian’s second body roared.</p><p>Countless sword lights appeared in the killing formation. Each sword light emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>This was a clone inscription formation that had taken several months to set up, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi swept down.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The sovereigns at the first, second, and third levels of the martial Royal realm were unable to block it at all. As the sword radiance slashed across, their bodies and spirits were destroyed.</p><p>Only those at the fourth level martial Royal realm could barely withstand it.</p><p>In just a few minutes, there were only dozens of Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts left in the void.</p><p>These people were virtually the divine Ruins continent group’s peak powerhouses already.</p><p>But these powerhouses were also struggling to hold on.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>With a shrill scream, Lu Ming saw hai pengtian’s heart being pierced by ten thousand swords and he died on the spot.</p><p>He was already injured, and now he was the first to die.</p><p>After the fall of hai pengtian, some of the weaker overlord figures were also killed one by one.</p><p>The number of people was decreasing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let us go. I’m willing to join you!”</p><p>“I’m also willing to do so. Please spare my life …”</p><p>Some people started to shout and beg for mercy.</p><p>you guys should just die. I’d rather believe in the dead!</p><p>kill them! Lu Ming said coldly. The formation was activated, and countless sword lights were unleashed. People were killed one after another.</p><p>These were the overlords of the divine Ruins ‘continent group, but at that moment, their lives were like grass, and they had fallen on this land.</p><p>A few minutes later, there were only five or six people left in the air, barely holding on.</p><p>These five or six people were the top experts of the divine Ruins ‘continent group. Each of them was only one step away from the fifth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>They tried their best to break through, but the formation covered a radius of 30000 miles. The sword Qi was endless, and they couldn’t break out at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>The last few people begged for mercy, but it didn’t work, so they started to curse.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>However, in the end, they were all killed by the formation.</p><p>There were more than 500 martial Royal realm experts who came to kill Lu Ming this time, but they were all massacred by Lu Ming. Not a single one was left.</p><p>Such a thing had never happened before in the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>After killing the last person, Lu Ming’s mind was completely at ease. He heaved a long sigh of relief and prepared to put away the storage ring.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly felt a sense of danger. This sense of danger made Lu Ming’s hair stand on end and he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying attack was launched at Lu Ming from behind.</p><p>It was too fast. It was so fast that Lu Ming could not react.</p><p>Almost subconsciously, it was a kind of instinct. With a thought, Ming Lian moved his secondary body and stood behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>It was a sword light that pierced through the Ming Lian clone’s chest. The terrifying sword Qi suddenly exploded, and half of the Ming Lian clone’s body exploded. Even half of his head exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ming Lian’s body flew far away, his aura extremely weak.</p><p>The second body was in mortal danger. The main body trembled and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, this delay had also bought Lu Ming some time.</p><p>The energy of the air-frozen bead gushed in. Lu Ming cast the wind element art and his figure was like a Phantom, retreating backward rapidly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, the sharp blade that attacked him advanced and charged toward Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>It was a sword light with a world-shaking sharpness that could kill everything.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen such a sharp sword.</p><p>At this moment, dandan and bubbles also reacted. A piece of tortoiseshell blocked Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>A creak …</p><p>The turtle shell blocked some of the sword light, but it was still pierced through.</p><p>At this moment, the bubble opened a void channel. Lu Ming’s figure disappeared into the void channel and he appeared tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>He had finally avoided the fatal blow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword-light flashed, and a middle-aged man appeared in the void.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted when he saw this person.</p><p>This middle-aged burly man was the middle-aged burly man from the deity sect. Back then, he had chased after Lu Ming together with the master of the MU family and young master Lin. Later on, in the core of the divine Ruins, he was injured by the headless true dragon Rider and had to retreat in embarrassment.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming thought that the other party had already returned to the yuan continent. He did not expect that not only did the other party not return to the yuan continent, but he had also been hiding at the side. When Lu Ming was at his most relaxed, he launched a fatal blow.</p><p>If he had not blocked the attack, Lu Ming would have been dead.</p><p>However, the other party’s condition was not right.</p><p>His entire body was filled with a black mist, which was like a poisonous snake. It wrapped around the burly man of the heavenly God sect, making him look extremely ferocious. His breath was also unstable.</p><p>it’s equivalent to a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert!</p><p>Lu Ming estimated in his heart.</p><p>The other party’s cultivation should have been above the seventh level of the martial Royal realm, but because of the snake-like mist, his cultivation had dropped to the sixth level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>However, the sixth level of the martial Royal realm still far surpassed Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
