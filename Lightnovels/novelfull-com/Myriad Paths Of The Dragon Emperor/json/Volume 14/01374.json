Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a group of figures rushed out from below and stood behind hai pengtian. There were more than ten of them, and they were all emperors.</p><p>Those below the Emperor realm didn’t even dare to come up. Just that aura alone was enough to suffocate even Supreme martial artists.</p><p>“Who the hell are you? Who sent you to attack the sea suppressing Marshal?”</p><p>Hai pengtian’s gaze was cold as he stared at Lu Ming. He did not make a move immediately.</p><p>On the divine Ruins continent, not many forces dared to come here so brazenly. The sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion belonged to the South God Palace.</p><p>In the divine Ruins continent, only the other three great divine palaces would dare to do so. Thus, hai pengtian was slightly apprehensive and decided to ask clearly first.</p><p>“Me? Didn’t you send your second brother to catch me? I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up slightly as he spoke. His clear voice spread throughout the entire ancient city and rang in everyone’s ears.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>the number one person among the younger generation, the Lu Ming who holds the primordial chaos token? ”</p><p>he actually came to the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>The ancient city was in an uproar.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Hai pengtian’s eyes focused, and a cold killing intent flickered in them.</p><p>that’s right. He’s Lu Ming. I’ve seen him before when the major sects of the yuanlu continent were selecting their disciples!</p><p>A voice came from the ancient city.</p><p>Obviously, someone had recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>After receiving confirmation, hai pengtian’s eyes shone brightly, ” “That second brother of mine actually failed. Lu Ming, I really admire your guts. Coming to the divine Ruins, you actually dare to come to my sea suppressing Marshal’s Manor to kill people. Today, don’t you leave!”</p><p>The aura on hai pengtian’s body became more and more vigorous. He was about to make his move.</p><p>“Marshal, you don’t need to do anything to deal with a little kid. I’ll take him down and avenge the two young masters!”</p><p>A Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm elder stepped out from behind hai pengtian and bowed.</p><p>“Alright! Cripple his cultivation first, but don’t kill him!”</p><p>Hai pengtian instructed.</p><p>“Yes, don’t worry, Marshal!”</p><p>yes, ” the LV 3 martial Royal realm elder replied. He then walked toward Lu Ming and locked his aura onto him.</p><p>this Lu Ming, second master went to the divine wilderness continent to look for him, but he actually hid in the divine Ruins continent. But he’s also stupid to come to the Marshal’s Manor to vent his anger. He probably suffered a lot from second master. That’s good, it should be my credit!</p><p>The LV 3 Martial Emperor realm old man thought to himself as he revealed a ferocious look.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A metal rod appeared in his hand and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Perfect, kill them one by one!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a cold light. If hai pengtian had attacked him, it would have been troublesome. Now that this elder had volunteered, it had given Lu Ming a chance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and threw a punch.</p><p>The fist and the metal rod collided heavily. Lu Ming’s entire body’s strength suddenly exploded.</p><p>The third-level Martial Emperor realm elder’s expression changed drastically. His eyes were filled with disbelief. He had not expected Lu Ming’s strength to be so terrifying.</p><p>Then, his body staggered backward.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and appeared in front of the elder in an instant. He threw a punch.</p><p>The old man gathered all his energy into the long staff and swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed. He took a step forward and waved his hand. The martial arts Phoenix Feather flying sword whizzed out and attacked the old man.</p><p>This time, it was too sudden, and he was caught off guard.</p><p>The elder’s attention was on Lu Ming. He did not expect another Lu Ming to appear between Lu Ming’s brows. It was too late for him to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>The five Phoenix Feather flying swords pierced through the old man’s five vital points and killed him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After killing the elder, Lu Ming did not stop at all. He controlled the air-frozen bead and a green energy surged into Lu Ming’s body. Then, he cast the wind element art and his speed reached its maximum.</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the other sovereigns. The Dragon vein sword appeared and he slashed at them.</p><p>Two first level martial emperors were killed by Lu Ming with a single slash.</p><p>All of this had happened too quickly. Only now did the ROC King react.</p><p>The main thing was that everything was too unexpected.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was clearly that of a Supreme. A third level martial Royal realm expert was killed by a Supreme in an instant. By the time he reacted, Lu Ming had already killed two more people.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Hai pengtian was furious. He roared and sent a palm towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Hai pengtian furiously struck out with this palm, its might incomparably shocking.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the myriad array diagram appeared. In an instant, dozens of defensive arrays appeared to block hai pengtian.</p><p>But …</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as these formations crumbled under the force of hai pengtian’s palm.</p><p>The strength of a Lv 4 Martial Emperor was too strong!</p><p>The all formations diagram was an Emperor spiritual weapon. The formations inside would become more powerful as the cultivation of the second body increased.</p><p>With his current realm, activating these formations would be extremely useful against Lv 3 martial emperors. However, under hai pengtian’s palm, they all exploded.</p><p>The second body’s expression changed slightly. He didn’t want to make any mistakes, but he wanted to avoid them. The mental energy fire between his brows lit up, and more formations appeared in the million formation illustration.</p><p>They were all defensive and trapping type. His goal was to block hai pengtian for a period of time.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took the lead and cast the wind element technique to attack the other sovereigns.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming was unrivaled as the Dragon vein sword slashed across. Regardless of whether they were at the first or second level of the martial Royal realm, they were all killed in one move.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few more people died under Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was too fast. These people did not even have time to escape.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Hai pengtian roared in anger. A pair of golden wings appeared on his back, like the wings of a great ROC.</p><p>Of course, these weren’t real wings. They were spiritual weapons, Emperor-level spiritual weapons!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A pair of golden wings, like two heavenly swords, swept across. The great formation activated by the million formation illustration was continuously being destroyed. Hai pengtian rapidly attacked the second body.</p><p>He took a few steps forward, and runes and arrays appeared in the air to coordinate with the all array diagram.</p><p>In the end, the second body even used the inscription scrolls. With a wave of his hand, hundreds of inscription scrolls flew out. All kinds of energy poured out towards hai pengtian.</p><p>For a moment, hai pengtian was unable to break through the defense of his second body.</p><p>The main body continued to kill!</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword slashed out, and another two people were killed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there was only one emperor left in the void.</p><p>A third level Martial Emperor!</p><p>This Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm old man had long been scared out of his wits. He did not dare to resist at all and hid behind hai pengtian, thus escaping this calamity.</p><p>Lu Ming had almost killed all the martial emperors in the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
