Also, you think you’re great just because you’re an Emperor? in my eyes, you’re not even worth mentioning!”</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Qu Luo was furious. He stood up from his seat and his Emperor power burst out. A terrible pressure pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was as calm as a Buddha’s face. He sat there without moving.</p><p>“Quluo, sit down!”</p><p>Xie Luan berated.</p><p>ancestor devil, you’ve seen it for yourself. This man is so arrogant that he doesn’t even put an Emperor in his eyes. I used to think that he was the number one figure, but now it seems that I’ve completely misjudged him!</p><p>Qu Luo said.</p><p>“I’m not looking down on the Emperor, I’m looking down on you!” Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You’re looking down on me? Good, good, good, I’d like to see how much you’ve improved after your trip to the divine Ruins continent. Today, I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of The Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>Qu Luo was furious. He said ” good ” three times in a row and stepped out of his seat. His aura grew stronger and stronger. Some of the Supreme-beings at the side had a change in expression and found it difficult to breathe.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then go out and fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward. In a flash, he was out of the hall and in the sky above the hall.</p><p>Many people were stunned. What did Lu Ming say? He was going to fight with quluo? Did he really dare to fight with quluo?</p><p>Many people thought they had heard wrong.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had concealed his aura, they could still sense that he was only at the spiritual God Realm. A young man at the spiritual God Realm was actually going to fight with an Emperor?</p><p>Lu Ming was not crazy. He was really arrogant.</p><p>hahaha, you’ve all seen it. This kid is arrogant and ignorant. I’ll teach him a lesson!</p><p>Qu Luo laughed in anger, his eyes full of anger.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to challenge him. A spiritual God challenging an Emperor was a great insult to him.</p><p>He had to teach Lu Ming a lesson.</p><p>He did not think that all this was the result of him provoking Lu Ming.</p><p>Qu Luo also came out of the hall and flew to the sky.</p><p>“Let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The experts in the hall all rushed out of the hall and stood in the void.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Yan kuangtu also rushed out of the hall with a worried look on his face.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A strange look flashed across Xie Luan’s eyes. Based on his understanding of Lu Ming, he knew that Lu Ming was not an arrogant person. On the contrary, Lu Ming would never fight a battle that he was not confident in. Could Lu Ming really create a miracle and fight against an Emperor?</p><p>A look of anticipation appeared in Xie Luan’s eyes, and he also left the hall.</p><p>“Look, who’s that?”</p><p>“That’s demon Emperor quluo. The other one is commander Lu Ming!”</p><p>“What’s this for? From the looks of it, demon Emperor quluo is going to fight general Lu!”</p><p>that can’t be. Demon Emperor quluo is an Emperor. How can general Lu be his match? ”</p><p>With so many experts gathered in the sky, their auras were vast and the commotion was huge. Within the hundred beasts tribe, many people sensed the commotion and looked over. Some people were discussing in disbelief.</p><p>High up in the sky.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I admit that although you’re talented, you’re too arrogant and condescending. Today, I’ll teach you a good lesson and make you come to your senses and recognize yourself!”</p><p>Quluo’s voice rang out as he stepped forward. With every step he took, heaven and earth seemed to resonate with him, rumbling and trembling. The powerful aura belonging to a Martial Emperor burst out and filled the world, making many people shiver and break out in cold sweat.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones were forced to their knees. It was as if they were facing the heavenly Dao. They were unable to resist.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood still in the void. He did not move at all and did not even lift his eyelids.</p><p>this world is much bigger than you can imagine. The divine wilderness continent is just a small piece of land. In the entire primordial realm, a first level Martial Emperor is just the lowest level of existence. A mere first level Martial Emperor is already so high and mighty. Your achievements will stop here!</p><p>A calm and indifferent voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>“Shut up! How can you judge my achievements?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words infuriated qu Luo. He was the first to move. He stepped forward and clenched his claw in the air. A Dark Claw condensed from demonic Qi grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Even a Supreme-being would be seriously injured by this claw.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not move in the face of this claw. It was as if he did not see it and allowed the huge claw to claw him.</p><p>“Why didn’t lu Ming retaliate?”</p><p>could he be scared? or is he confined? the power of an Emperor is too terrifying. He can confine the world. Lu Ming might want to attack but he can’t move!</p><p>Seeing this scene, many people made guesses.</p><p>“Lu Ming, quickly run!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu grew anxious.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still did not move.</p><p>Hmph, a mere spiritual God Realm ant dares to preach to me. I’ll teach him a good lesson. As long as I don’t kill him and break a few bones, I don’t think The Fiend ancestor will blame me!</p><p>Qu Luo sneered, and his demonic Qi intensified.</p><p>In an instant, The Giant Claw was about to grab Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally moved.</p><p>Lu Ming’s action was very simple. He simply threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The space exploded like tofu. The claw that quluo had condensed also exploded and disappeared under Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s seemingly casual punch had destroyed the claw condensed from quluo demonic Qi.</p><p>Although qu Luo did not use his true abilities, he could still injure a Supreme-being, but Lu Ming had defeated him so easily.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Had Lu Ming’s combat strength already reached this level? It was too shocking.</p><p>what a powerful punch. It’s full of power, especially the power of the physical body. It’s amazing. Why do I feel like my spirit body is going to explode? ”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor said, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>“I have the same feeling!”</p><p>The other sovereigns also spoke out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s eyes were even brighter.</p><p>you have some skills. Take another move from me!</p><p>Qu Luo roared. He felt humiliated after being blocked by Lu Ming, and the anger in his heart grew.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The demonic domain spread out from his body and enveloped Lu Ming. At the same time, his muscles swelled up and he suddenly threw a punch.</p><p>This punch contained the power of the territory and the power of the Spirit body. It was ten times stronger than the previous move.</p><p>Quluo had used his real power and displayed the power of an Emperor.</p><p>Roarrrr!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded within Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, his third bloodline appeared and a wisp of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
