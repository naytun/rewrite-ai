He had finally killed di hongcheng.</p><p>...</p><p>Xie Luan had naturally been paying attention to the battle this entire time, so he knew everything that was happening.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and decide the winner!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s voice rang out, his killing intent as sharp as a blade.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor, quluo, barbarian Emperor, and the others were all filled with fighting spirit as they charged towards the remaining sovereigns of the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>As for the remaining sovereigns of the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they didn’t have any fighting spirit at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming is invincible. Run!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The sovereigns of the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were almost scared out of their wits. At this moment, they no longer had any intention to fight and turned to run.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook and suppressed all directions, blocking the way.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi suddenly rushed in one direction.</p><p>The battle was over, and Di Yi was ready to escape.</p><p>Di Yi, where are you going? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, and the two Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons pressed down on Di Yi.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Di Yi blocked it with his King spiritual weapon, but it was not of much use. The sword hummed and Di Yi spat out a mouthful of blood. Cracks appeared on his body and he almost exploded.</p><p>“Burn!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi roared, and the true dragons, phoenixes, and other phenomenons around him suddenly burned. His aura suddenly soared several times.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi turned into a rainbow light and rushed out of the encirclement, flying into the distance.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and chased after Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>At the same time, he secretly instructed tu Qian to bring men to kill the remaining emperors of the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan.</p><p>After being surrounded by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, the remaining sovereigns of the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were surrounded by tu Qian, the baizhan Martial Emperor, and the others.</p><p>He didn’t need to worry about this place anymore. The overall situation had already been set.</p><p>Although there were still some sovereigns left in the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, they were not too strong. Xie cangqiong was being held back by the old general, but the two of them were still fighting.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, there were experts like tu Qian, Xie Luan, the warring Martial Emperor, and Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The two of them instantly left.</p><p>In the Imperial City, another battle broke out, but there was no suspense in this battle.</p><p>The sovereigns of the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were all killed here.</p><p>Lu Ming and Di Yi, one chasing and one escaping, traveled tens of thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p>The second body took a step forward and disappeared between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. At the same time, runes appeared on Lu Ming’s main body. These were all auxiliary runes that increased his speed. Lu Ming’s speed increased greatly and he began to catch up with Di Yi and Martial Emperor.</p><p>Di Yi, you’ve lost. Where do you want to go? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out. He activated the wind element technique and his speed increased.</p><p>Di Yi’s face was pale, and his eyes were cold and full of killing intent. Without saying a word, he gritted his teeth and fled.</p><p>His body was burning with flames, which made him move at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Di Yi was burning his spirit body of ten thousand meridians.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be happy too soon. I’m going to tear you into pieces this morning!”</p><p>Di Yi roared in his heart. His desire to kill Lu Ming was extremely strong.</p><p>He had cultivated for 10000 years, plundering all kinds of bloodlines and using the essence blood of various experts to cultivate the spirit body of 10000 meridians. He was just a little bit away from completing his cultivation.</p><p>But now, all his previous efforts were in vain.</p><p>In order to escape, he had burned the ten thousand Meridian spirit body, turning all his hard work over the years into nothing.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and the other fleeing, broke through the void at an astonishing speed and travelled through the alternate dimension.</p><p>Not long later, he crossed central continent and arrived in Northern Plains, after that, he flew towards the endless ocean.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi roared in his heart and became more and more anxious. He was already seriously injured, and after the long journey, his injuries had worsened.</p><p>At this rate, Lu Ming would catch up to him.</p><p>He was not willing to die Here. He wanted to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and revealed a determined expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>Di Yi let out a roar, and the flames on his body suddenly rose.</p><p>“Explode! Burn!”</p><p>Di Yi roared. Then, his speed suddenly skyrocketed. He passed through layers of space and went far away at a high speed. The distance between him and Lu Ming was rapidly widening.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming also admired Di Yi’s decisiveness. He could see that Di Yi had completely burned his spirit body. His ten thousand meridians spirit body could be considered to have been cultivated in vain. Even if he escaped, Di Yi’s realm might not be able to maintain it and would regress.</p><p>In the future, it would even be difficult to improve. In order to save his life, Di Yi had to give it his all.</p><p>The distance between the two of them grew wider and wider. In the end, Lu Ming could barely see Di Yi’s shadow.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming could no longer see or sense Di Yi’s existence.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to stop.</p><p>“This fellow managed to escape. However, this fellow is seriously injured and has completely burned his spiritual body. His cultivation level will definitely decline and he will no longer be a threat to me in the future. However …”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He thought of di hongcheng and the red-robed elder.</p><p>Where did these two people come from? And he was using a unified Emperor spiritual weapon. Could it be that there was a powerful force behind Di Yi?</p><p>Lu Ming was not worried about Di Yi himself. He was more worried about the possible forces behind Di Yi.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll deal with it when the soldiers come, and I’ll deal with it when the water comes!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming turned around and headed toward the holy city.</p><p>When Lu Ming returned to the holy city, the war had already ended.</p><p>There was no suspense.</p><p>With tu Qian and Xie Luan around, the battle was almost one-sided.</p><p>Almost all of the emperors of the Empyrean divine Palace had been killed. Only a few emperors from the Overlord forces of the central continent had surrendered to Di Yi and were controlled by Xie Luan and the others. They had to obey them obediently after the formation was set up.</p><p>As for the Xie family’s emperors, only a few were left. The rest had all been killed.</p><p>Xie Qitian, the old divine Emperor, Xie cangqiong, and a white-haired elder were surrounded by Xie Luan and the others.</p><p>Xie Luan and the rest knew about the relationship between Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. They also knew that Xie nianqing was a member of the Xie family. Therefore, they did not kill these people. They deliberately waited for Lu Ming to return.</p><p>Xie Qitian and the others stood on the platform, their eyes listless and full of despair.</p><p>He was defeated, utterly defeated.</p><p>This time, the Xie clan was even more miserable than when Xie Luan had thrown the world into chaos and betrayed the Xie clan thirty thousand years ago.</p><p>Last time, they had at least suppressed Xie Luan and preserved some of their strength. There was still hope for them to slowly recover.</p><p>But this time, they had been completely defeated. All of their experts had died, and there was nothing they could do to reverse the situation.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>In the sacred city, countless disciples of the Xie family, such as Xie Yan and others, were lying on the ground, their eyes listless.</p><p>The Xie clan had been defeated, and even the Emperor had been defeated. The others were simply powerless to reverse the situation. If they made a move, they would only be courting death.</p><p>The other martial artists also had complicated looks in their eyes.</p><p>Was the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty, which had been around for millions of years, going to be destroyed?</p><p>From now on, who would be the master of the divine wilderness continent’s rise and fall?</p><p>At the same time, many people’s gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
