From the looks of it, the sea suppressing divine ape was very respectful beside Lu Ming. It was obvious that it had been subdued by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although the crowd was amazed that even an existence like the sea suppressing divine ape had been subdued by Lu Ming, the appearance of the sea suppressing divine ape could not change the outcome of the battle.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape was only equivalent to an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His glabella glowed again and another figure appeared beside him.</p><p>This time, tu Qian appeared.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze landed on tu Qian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out from tu Qian’s body.</p><p>“This is … A puppet?”</p><p>it’s really a puppet. What a terrifying aura. It’s equivalent to the peak of Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>heavens, it’s really … The strength of his aura isn’t any weaker than the chaotic sky Emperor’s!</p><p>Tu Qian’s appearance caused the entire place to go into an uproar. Everyone was shocked.</p><p>When everyone looked at Lu Ming, the respect in their eyes grew.</p><p>Not only was Lu Ming’s combat strength strong, but he also had such a powerful expert by his side. When they added up, his strength was terrifying.</p><p>he’s Tu Qian. Everyone can see that he’s a puppet with a cultivation equivalent to the peak of the second level martial Royal realm. He’s strong enough to resist an expert at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“But the other party has an Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Who said he doesn’t have any?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His palm glowed and a huge axe appeared in his hand. He then flew towards tu Qian.</p><p>“This … An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Some people’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>Lu Ming’s methods were endless. First, he had experts like the sea suppressing divine ape and tu Qian. Now, he could even take out an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Some of them knew that the Emperor spirit tower in Yan kuangtu’s hands belonged to Lu Ming. Now, Lu Ming had taken out another Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Many people had nothing to say. It was normal for something unbelievable to happen to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, tu Qian can deal with a second level Martial Emperor expert. I can deal with one, but there’s still one left …” He said.</p><p>Xie Luan spoke, his eyes still somewhat grave.</p><p>“Leave the other one to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice full of confidence.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie Luan was slightly taken aback.</p><p>The others were stunned as well. Although Lu Ming was strong and not weaker than a peak second level Martial Emperor, he was no match for the other party after he had an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Moreover, it was obvious that Lu Ming did not have a suitable Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon had to be compatible with one’s attribute in order to unleash its power.</p><p>Most importantly, even if Lu Ming had a suitable Emperor spiritual weapon, it would be useless. The reason why the Emperor spiritual weapon was so powerful was that the user had activated the domain in it.</p><p>In order to activate the domain of an Emperor spiritual weapon, one had to at least comprehend the early stage of the domain. Lu Ming’s cultivation had not reached the Supreme level, so even if he had a suitable Emperor spiritual weapon, he would not be able to unleash its power.</p><p>Then, how could Lu Ming block a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming raised his head and looked in the direction of the door.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the entrance, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>It was a young man with a slender figure and a handsome face. He was wearing a white robe with strange patterns. He had an ethereal temperament, like a god.</p><p>“Lu … General Lu?”</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>Most of the people were stunned as they looked at the figure at the gate.</p><p>That’s right. At the entrance was Lu Ming’s Ming Lian clone.</p><p>Everyone’s spiritual sense swept over Ming Lian’s body and they were even more shocked.</p><p>That was because the aura of the Ming Lian clone was exactly the same as Lu Ming’s. They were clearly the same person.</p><p>Other than Yan kuangtu and a few others, everyone else had a dumbstruck expression.</p><p>Why were there two Lu Mings?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s aura was too shocking. A vast pressure filled the hall and put everyone under great pressure.</p><p>An Emperor, this was the pressure of an Emperor.</p><p>That’s right, Lu Ming’s inscription clone had received the inheritance of the mysterious sky Saint. After cultivating hard every day, he had finally broken through to a ninth-level inscription master not long ago and became an Emperor.</p><p>The Ming Lian clone had just broken through not long ago. Lu Ming had planned to let the Ming Lian clone stabilize for a while, but now, he had no choice but to recall the clone in advance.</p><p>“He’s me, I’m him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body smiled.</p><p>The clone nodded at Lu Ming and took a step forward. Its body shrunk rapidly and rushed into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. It sat cross-legged in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>Many people were flabbergasted and had yet to react.</p><p>Could this be Lu Ming’s clone?</p><p>Lu Ming actually had a clone that was equivalent to an Emperor?</p><p>Lu Ming was becoming more and more mysterious in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>leave the other peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>However, Xie Luan and the others still looked solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming, the holy city is the Xie family’s base camp. They have a deep and unfathomable Foundation. No one knows what tricks they have up their sleeves, but according to my speculation, there will definitely be a lot of King spiritual weapons. There might even be people at the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Thirty thousand years ago, Xie Luan had fought against the Xie clan, so he was well aware of the Xie clan’s methods.</p><p>Back then, Xie Luan had swept across the world with his cultivation at the peak of the third level martial Royal realm. No one could defeat him. However, he was still suppressed by the Xie family in the end.</p><p>Although the Xie family seemed to have declined, they could not be underestimated.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This battle was of utmost importance. It concerned everyone’s lives and the future of the divine wilderness continent. It had to be taken seriously.</p><p>moreover, even if we’re not weak in terms of high-end combat strength, there are many emperors when the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace join forces. We’re no match for them in this aspect!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>The others also fell into deep thought.</p><p>That was indeed the case. Their overall combat strength was still far from that of the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>in terms of high-end combat strength, I still have a trump card. It’s not a problem for me to fight against two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts. As for overall strength, we need to find allies. Don’t forget that the heaven suppressing divine Army is more anxious than us!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and seemed to be very confident.</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes lit up. that’s right. If that’s the case, we’ll have a chance with the heaven suppressing divine Army. Alright, Lu Ming, I’ll go with you to the heaven suppressing divine Army after a while. We’ll decide the outcome of this battle with one battle!</p><p>“We will definitely win this battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s confident voice was heard.</p><p>“We will definitely win!”</p><p>The others were infected and also shouted.</p><p>Next, they discussed some specific details. After half a day, the crowd dispersed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
