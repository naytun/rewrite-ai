Not only did it have the effect of trapping the enemy, but it also had a terrifying offensive technique.</p><p>Existences below the Emperor level, once trapped within the domain, would not have the slightest strength to fight back, and would be at the mercy of others.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard from within Lu Ming’s body as nine streams of dragon energy burst forth. At the same time, he borrowed the power of his third bloodline, giving Lu Ming terrifying strength.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was as sharp as a knife. He used the prison-suppressing heavenly art and struck out.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>This palm was like a heavenly blade that appeared in the world. With one slash, the sky and earth split open. An extremely powerful force exploded. The earth territory of the elder in the purple-gold robe trembled violently as Lu Ming forcefully tore a hole in it.</p><p>The expression of the elder in the purple-gold robe changed. His figure flashed and he appeared in the territory. He pointed a finger at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’d like to experience the strength of an Emperor!”</p><p>The true vitality in Lu Ming’s body boiled. His cultivation of the great circle of the spiritual God Realm was exerted to the extreme. Lu Ming struck out with his palm again, and this palm collided with the other party’s finger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a deafening boom and the earth domain shook violently. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. He stepped in the air and retreated.</p><p>However, the elder in the purple-gold robe also took a few steps back.</p><p>that’s a spirit body! What a powerful force!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a breath of turbid air and pondered in his heart.</p><p>A Martial Emperor was indeed extraordinary. The elder in the purple-gold robe was at the first level Martial Emperor realm, but his combat strength was considered strong even among the first level martial emperors. Lu Ming was at a slight disadvantage in the previous move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was still far from being fully displayed.</p><p>Even so, the elder in the purple-gold robe was shocked.</p><p>what terrifying power. Is he still a martial artist in the great circle of the spiritual God stage? ”</p><p>The eyes of the elder in the purple-gold robe became serious.</p><p>On the side, the others were already dumbfounded and stood there in a daze.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually fight an Emperor. He was shrouded in the emperor’s territory and could still fight head-on with the Emperor. It was unbelievable.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step back and stomped in the air, shattering the void. He continued to pounce on the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>In the process of pouncing forward, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. Lu Ming performed the blood Meridian fusion and transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>After transforming into the nine Dragons, he struck out with his dragon claws and executed all kinds of martial techniques of creation.</p><p>he’s using so many martial techniques of creation at the same time!</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe had a serious expression on his face. His hands glowed and a pair of spirit weapon gloves appeared on his hands.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t an Emperor weapon, but an ordinary ninth-level spiritual weapon.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon, the Emperor of spiritual weapons, wasn’t something an ordinary person could possess. Many emperors didn’t have one.</p><p>with the spirit weapon gloves on, the elder’s body began to swell, and his muscles began to squirm. A layer of earthen yellow light appeared on the surface of his muscles as he pushed the power of his spirit body to the limit and punched out a few times.</p><p>The power of each punch was stronger than the power of the previous finger.</p><p>The fist force collided with the nine Dragons ‘Dragon Claw.</p><p>But this time, as soon as the two came into contact, the elder’s expression changed drastically. His body trembled, and the earthen yellow light around him trembled.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few rumbles, the body of the elder in the purple-gold robe was sent flying. He retreated a few thousand meters in the air, leaving a space crack that was a few thousand meters long.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body did not move an inch.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>At the scene, everyone was once again stunned.</p><p>The Emperor was actually at a disadvantage and was sent flying thousands of meters.</p><p>the strength of an Emperor is only so-so. Since you want to make a move, I’ll send you on your way first!</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. He twisted his dragon body and charged toward the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The purple-and-golden-robed elder was shocked as he forcefully suppressed the boiling blood in his body.</p><p>His combat strength was considered strong even among the first level martial emperors. However, he was not a match for a young man in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. This was simply like a fantasy.</p><p>How could a martial artist in the great circle of the spirit God Realm possess such powerful combat strength?</p><p>If it were an ordinary great circle spiritual God, he would be able to kill them with a single slap.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was coming for him again, the elder in the purple-gold robe could only use all his strength to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. However, Lu Ming had transformed into the nine Dragons and his strength had increased greatly. On his dragon claws, he used different martial arts techniques of different concepts in turns. The power was shocking. Some of the Dragon claws could also use the prison suppressing heaven technique, giving the elder in the purple-gold robe a lot of pressure.</p><p>Although the elder in the purple-gold robe had used all his strength, he was no match for the other party. He was at a disadvantage as soon as they exchanged blows.</p><p>After a few moves, he was scratched by Lu Ming.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he had cultivated the spiritual body of the earth, which was more defensive and had amazing defensive power, he would have died. Even so, he still felt the burning pain all over his body and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>At this time, the sea churned and many figures rushed out.</p><p>They were the experts who had entered the ancient underwater city. They had all rushed out.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out, they were shocked to see Lu Ming and the elder in the purple-gold robe fighting.</p><p>“That’s an Emperor!”</p><p>Oh my God, Lu Ming has completely suppressed the king. The king is injured!</p><p>Cries of alarm rang out.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ming’s combat strength in the ancient city. However, when they saw Lu Ming injure an Emperor with their own eyes, the impact was still very strong.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battle continued, and in just a dozen moves, the elder in the purple-gold robe was beaten to the point where he spat out large mouthfuls of blood. His hair was disheveled and he looked extremely pathetic.</p><p>He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming. Even though he had his territory and spirit body, it was useless. Lu Ming was too powerful and had completely surpassed him.</p><p>“It’s time to end this!”</p><p>attack! Lu Ming shouted and struck out with his claw. This claw was a fusion of five martial arts techniques of creation and there was a flash of chaotic light.</p><p>This claw made the elder in the purple-gold robe feel a fatal threat.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! the elder in the purple-gold robe roared. A battle-axe suddenly appeared in his hand. The battle-axe quickly grew larger and turned into a giant axe that held up the sky. It stood between the sky and the earth, and an extremely terrifying Imperial pressure spread out.</p><p>Emperor spiritual weapon. This battleaxe was the same one that Hai Yu had used before.</p><p>It seemed that Hai Yu had given the Emperor spiritual weapon to the purple-and-golden-robed elder. No wonder Hai Yu was so confident and stayed here.</p><p>An Emperor using an Emperor spiritual weapon and a Supreme Being using an Emperor spiritual weapon were two completely different things.</p><p>When a Supreme martial artist used an Emperor spiritual weapon, he would not be able to unleash its true power. When an Emperor used an Emperor spiritual weapon, its power would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>The old man in the purple-gold robe controlled the battle-ax as if he could split the sky and the earth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle-ax struck down, and the huge ax radiance collided with the nine Dragons ‘claws.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
