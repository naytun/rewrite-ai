His skin was covered with a thick layer of dirt, which were all impurities.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed his body and realized that it was filled with explosive power. It was pure physical strength and not the power of vital essence.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming could feel that his body was full of qi and blood. With a single thought, his qi and blood would rush out of his body and burn like a furnace, full of strong vitality.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how is it?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked, blinking his big eyes.</p><p>“About 10%!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>A pure spirit body could not be achieved overnight. One had to take it one step at a time and slowly cultivate to perfection.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could be considered to have cultivated the initial stage of a pure spirit body. He was about ten percent done.</p><p>“Little Qing, you’re next. I’ll help you guard!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. She began to cultivate the pure spirit body. 108 paths appeared in her body.</p><p>The cultivation process was similar to Lu Ming’s. He absorbed the origin Energy from the origin stone and tempered his body.</p><p>A few days later, Xie nianqing finished his cultivation. Like Lu Ming, he had also reached 10%.</p><p>“Come, let’s go out and clean ourselves up!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>His body was covered in a layer of dirt and it was really uncomfortable.</p><p>The two of them left the mountain and river diagram and jumped into the sea to wash up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sea, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>This punch didn’t use true Yuan, nor did he use the power of his bloodline. It was purely physical strength.</p><p>In the sea, it was as if an ancient giant beast was going berserk. In front of Lu Ming’s fist, the sea water suddenly exploded. The powerful force of the fist created a hundred-mile long passage in the sea.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the pure physical strength of this punch could kill an eighth or even ninth level spiritual God expert.</p><p>This was only a pure spirit body at ten percent maturity. If it was cultivated to one hundred percent perfection, the power would be terrifying.</p><p>At that time, it would be easy to kill a Supreme martial artist with one punch.</p><p>Of course, the higher the level of attainment, the harder it would be to cultivate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not far away from Lu Ming, Xie nianqing also waved his palm, stirring the sea water and forming a wave that was a thousand meters high.</p><p>“As expected of a pure spirit body!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a smile on his face.</p><p>With a stronger physical body, Lu Ming’s combat ability would naturally be stronger as well.</p><p>a pure spirit body. It’s not a true spirit body yet. It’s not as amazing as a true spirit body, but its power is already very shocking. No wonder the Emperor is so powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>After washing up, the two of them returned to the back of Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p><p>Thunder Rhino Supreme continued on his way, while Lu Ming and Xie nianqing continued their cultivation.</p><p>Xie nianqing entered the mountain and river diagram and focused on cultivating his pure spirit body.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he would cultivate his pure spirit body for a period of time every day. He would also take some time to cultivate five types of martial arts techniques of creation.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s various aspects were slowly improving.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>With the lightning rhinoceros Supreme’s speed, it would take at least four months to fly from the divine Ruins continent to the divine wilderness continent. Only 20 days had passed, so there was still a long distance to go.</p><p>Dandan and bubbles would rush into the depths of the ocean from time to time in search of natural treasures. During this period of time, their mouths had not been idle at all. They had swallowed countless spirit herbs and their entire bodies were filled with a strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>In half a month, Lu Ming’s pure spirit body had already reached thirty percent.</p><p>With just his physical body, even a great circle spiritual God stage expert would be injured with a single punch.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming temporarily stopped cultivating.</p><p>my current cultivation is at the great circle of the spiritual God stage, and my Foundation is solid. I can try to break through to the Supreme level. However, to break through to the Supreme level, I need to comprehend an embryonic domain. To comprehend an embryonic domain, I need to spread the runes of intent and integrate them into the spiritual God. I still have no clue.</p><p>“Let’s see if the domain solidifying pill can help me!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and a Jade bottle appeared in his hand.</p><p>It was the domain solidifying pill that he had obtained when he had participated in the selection of the disciples of the major sects in the yuanlu continent.</p><p>A martial artist in the great circle of the spirit God stage would be able to greatly increase their chances of forming a prototype domain if they consumed the domain solidifying pill, allowing them to step into the Supreme-being stage.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming swallowed the solidifying domain pill and began to refine it.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming opened his eyes, a look of disappointment on his face.</p><p>“It’s useless. It’s completely useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>He had refined a domain solidifying pill, but it was completely useless.</p><p>Originally, the domain solidifying pill could help Lu Ming to open up the concept runes and integrate them into the spiritual God to form the embryonic form of the domain.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming refined the entire domain consolidation pill earlier, the intent runes did not move at all.</p><p>it’s said that the stronger the intent, the harder it is to form a domain. It seems like it’s true!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He knew that it was because the chaos concept was too powerful. One domain solidifying pill did not have much effect. It was tens or even hundreds of times more difficult for Lu Ming to refine the embryonic form of the chaos Domain than other concepts.</p><p>“Let’s take it slow!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He gave up on the idea of breaking through to the Supreme-being level for the time being and focused on cultivating the pure spirit body and martial arts technique of creation.</p><p>Time passed day by day. Two months had passed since Lu Ming went out to sea.</p><p>After two months of hard work, he had reached the peak of the fourth level. Of course, it would be more difficult for him to break through the fourth level.</p><p>He was a pure spirit body, and he had cultivated to 40%, almost reaching 50%.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was also constantly improving.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s pure spirit body was about the same as Lu Ming’s. It was close to fifty percent. It was worth mentioning that Xie nianqing’s cultivation was also improving due to the continuous breakthroughs of his pure spirit body. He entered the great circle of the spirit God Realm in one go.</p><p>Her cultivation had already reached the peak of the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm after being in the primal Chaos Palace for more than three years. Now that she had cultivated a pure spirit body, it was completely natural for her to enter the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly sensed movement outside. His body flickered and he exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“WOWO, didn’t you just steal a few spiritual herbs? If you dare to chase after this Lord, I’ll remember this!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and together with the bubble, they rushed out of the ocean and flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The sea water churned and the sea water within a thousand miles was stirred up. Then, a big furry hand stretched out from the sea and grabbed at dandan and bubbles.</p><p>The furry hand was a thousand miles long and was covered in long, sparkling blue hair. It exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>An Emperor, this was the aura of an Emperor!</p><p>“How dare you steal medicine in my territory! Die!”</p><p>A furious roar came from the bottom of the sea. The giant hand sped up and grabbed at dandan and bubble.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Papa spat out a transparent bubble and opened up a spatial passageway. It and dandan rushed into the spatial passageway and instantly appeared on Supreme lightning rhinoceros ‘back.</p><p>The giant hand turned and grabbed at Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
