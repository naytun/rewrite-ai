What business do you have with the Alliance master?”</p><p>...</p><p>Qu Luo was stunned and asked.</p><p>“Alliance master? It seems that Lu Ming’s status here is not low. Tell me, where is Lu Ming now?”</p><p>The green-robed man said.</p><p>“Why are you looking for the Alliance master?”</p><p>Qu Luo said cautiously.</p><p>“Nonsense, I told you to speak and you just said it. You really have a lot of nonsense!”</p><p>The green-robed man shouted impatiently. A powerful aura rose from his body and pressed down on qu Luo.</p><p>Quluo’s body trembled and he couldn’t help but take a few steps back. His face changed dramatically and he exclaimed, second level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>This green-robed man was actually a Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“Why are you looking for the Alliance master? Otherwise, don’t expect me to tell you!”</p><p>Quluo roared.</p><p>“Still not speaking, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>The green-robed man’s eyes turned cold as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Qu Luo’s figure retreated rapidly, and he put up layers of defense in front of him.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>However, qu Luo’s defense was shattered by the green-robed man’s palm. Qu Luo spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body flew out like a cannonball.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, quluo turned around and ran.</p><p>“Hmph, do you think that I won’t know if you run away?”</p><p>die! the green-robed man shouted coldly and did not pursue. He appeared under ninedragons and grabbed the head of a spiritual God Realm master. Green mist then shrouded the man.</p><p>ah! the spiritual God Realm master let out a shrill scream, and the people nearby trembled in fear.</p><p>“Speak. Where is Lu Ming?”</p><p>The green-robed man asked coldly.</p><p>“Alliance head, it’s in Dragon Emperor City, Dragon Emperor City!”</p><p>That person shouted.</p><p>“Dragon Emperor City? give me the map!”</p><p>The green-robed man shouted coldly. The man did not dare to disobey. He took out a map from his storage ring and handed it to the green-robed man.</p><p>The green-robed man flung the spiritual God Realm master away and opened the map. He sneered, ” hehe, Lu Ming, I’ve finally found you. It’s no wonder that I rushed over from the green rich continent!</p><p>A cold light flashed in the green-robed man’s eyes. He took a step forward and walked towards the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely know that the Lufeng continent was a continent in the southern part of the divine Ruins ‘continent cluster. It was adjacent to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>As soon as the green-robed man left, the spiritual God Realm master caught by the green-robed man gasped for breath and broke out in a cold sweat. Just when he thought he had escaped, a cloud of green mist suddenly emerged from his body and enveloped him.</p><p>A shrill scream sounded again.</p><p>After a while, when the mist dispersed, the spiritual God Realm master was only left with a skeleton.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>The people nearby all gasped.</p><p>A similar scene appeared in Southern nether and Northern Plains.</p><p>The emperors of both places were attacked.</p><p>In the Imperial Dragon City, Lu Ming had also received the news.</p><p>“An expert who fought to a draw with the continent has appeared in the southern underworld!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>All sides were attacked. The ones who appeared were all emperors with profound cultivation. Even the weakest one was a Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Only Nanming was able to confirm that he was the Emperor who had fought evenly with the continent.</p><p>a draw with the continent? then, based on the information, it’s highly possible that they came from several different continents. Strange!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>They came from different continents and suddenly came to the divine wilderness continent. Furthermore, all of them had the same goal, to find him, Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with doubts. Why did these experts from different continents come to the divine wilderness continent to find him at the same time?</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming received another message.</p><p>Someone is attacking Northern Plains ‘Demon God Valley.</p><p>The demon God Valley was the place where Xie Luan was in charge. Xie Luan showed his power and severely injured his opponent. Then, he took that man to the Imperial Dragon City through the inter-territory teleportation formation.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It was a good time to interrogate him.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and tore open the space. The next moment, he appeared at the border teleportation formation and saw Xie Luan.</p><p>There was also a skinny old man, his aura was weak and his face was pale. He lay on the ground with a face full of shock.</p><p>I’m from the White Feather continent. You’d better let me go. Otherwise, you’ll all die without a burial place!</p><p>The skinny old man roared, threatening Xie Lun.</p><p>The old man was at the second level of the martial Royal realm, but he was no match for Xie Lun.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and landed a footprint on the old man’s face, causing the old man’s face to come into close contact with the ground.</p><p>nonsense. Speak, why did you come to the divine wilderness continent to find me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The skinny old man’s eyes lit up and he stared at Lu Ming with a greedy look.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming exerted force on his feet. The old man struggled madly. However, his cultivation was sealed and it was useless to struggle.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’d better hand over the primordial chaos token and let me go. Otherwise, not only will you die, the entire divine wilderness continent will be buried with you!</p><p>The skinny old man roared.</p><p>“Mixed essence token? You’re here for the mixed essence token? Tell me, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming had not expected that these people would come for the primordial chaos token. He was even more curious.</p><p>“Quickly let me go …”</p><p>The skinny old man shouted.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the skinny old man’s legs twice. The skinny old man’s legs exploded and turned into dust.</p><p>The skinny old man gasped, and his eyes almost popped out. He then let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>To an Emperor, having his legs burst was nothing. With the exuberant vitality of a spirit body, he could recover very quickly. However, that heart-piercing pain was real.</p><p>tell me, tell me the truth. Tell me the ins and outs of the matter. Otherwise, the next kick will be your dantian!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>The skinny old man’s heart tightened. If Lu Ming stepped on his dantian, his spiritual God would be in danger.</p><p>In the end, the skinny old man helplessly told him everything he knew.</p><p>It turned out that a few months ago, a piece of shocking news had spread from the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>It was said that the South God Palace had captured a heaven’s favorite who had a primordial chaos token. With the token, one could freely enter and exit the divine Ruins and obtain the treasures inside.</p><p>The news caused a huge commotion.</p><p>Later on, there was more news that the Paragon with the primordial chaos token came from the divine wilderness continent. And there was another person in the divine wilderness continent who also had a primordial chaos token. His name was Lu Ming.</p><p>The entire news spread like a whirlwind across the divine Ruins continent, even to other continents.</p><p>The divine Ruins were too mysterious. Inside, it contained boundless treasures.</p><p>There were a few Divine Ruins in the divine Ruins continent, but it was very dangerous inside, especially the core. Even emperors would die if they went in.</p><p>But now, by using the mixed element token, one could actually enter the divine Ruins freely and obtain the treasures inside. This caused the continent group of the divine Ruins to go into a frenzy.</p><p>Since one piece was in the hands of the South God Palace, the others could only go and snatch the other piece, the one in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why the sovereigns of the various continents would travel such a long distance to the divine wilderness continent. Their goal was the mixed energy token he had.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
