Now, Lu Ming’s pure spirit body had been cultivated to perfection. Furthermore, the embryonic form of the chaos Domain was getting bigger and bigger. The combat strength of his main body had indeed improved greatly compared to before.</p><p>Right now, the combat strength of Lu Ming’s main body could be said to have reached a peak, a peak that was difficult to improve.</p><p>The overlords of the four great divine palaces had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>They could not probe Lu Ming’s actual situation by sending these people to the battlefield.</p><p>If they wanted to find out the truth, they had to send out a fourth level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>However, who among the overlords at the LV 4 martial Royal realm was willing to take the risk?</p><p>“I’ll make my move!”</p><p>After a while, hai pengtian spoke.</p><p>He had a deep hatred for Lu Ming, and he could not wait to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Hai pengtian stepped forward. The powerful aura of the fourth level Martial Emperor realm was fully released.</p><p>At the same time, a pair of golden wings appeared on his back, and the sharp energy cut open the space.</p><p>hai pengtian, that’s good. Today, I’ll send you to accompany your two sons and your second brother!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard from the nine Dragons.</p><p>“Little bastard, I’ll first cripple your cultivation and make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>Said hai pengtian. The wings on his back flapped and his figure disappeared as he pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>A pair of golden wings, like two extremely sharp blades, slashed at the nine Dragons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual consciousness to control the Dragon vein sword and blocked one of the sharp edges. At the same time, he used Nine Dragons steps to blast another sharp edge.</p><p>Clang! BOOM!</p><p>With a few rumbles, the nine Dragons ‘bodies trembled violently. They stepped on the void and retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Hai pengtian shouted coldly and continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>Beams of sharp light poured toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist, but he was still at a disadvantage. He was completely outmatched. The nine Dragons ‘bodies were covered with cracks.</p><p>The fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm was much stronger than the third level. Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure rushed out of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Second body inscription!</p><p>Ming Lian waved his hand, and five Phoenix Feather flying swords pierced through the void, heading towards hai pengtian. At the same time, the myriad formation diagram flew out, and endless great formations enveloped hai pengtian.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Hai pengtian’s golden wings flapped, knocking away the five Phoenix Feather flying swords and destroying a large area of the formation.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared in anger, and together with Ming Lian’s second body, they charged towards hai pengtian. The two of them began a great battle.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage, the main body and secondary body cooperated seamlessly and he could barely resist the attacks.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is really a genius!”</p><p>Even though they were enemies, a hegemon-level character couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>that’s right. I don’t know what kind of secret technique this kid is cultivating. His clone is a pure inscriber and has reached the Emperor realm. Unbelievable!</p><p>“Could it be a powerful puppet technique?”</p><p>The various hegemons spoke.</p><p>With their knowledge, it was naturally impossible for them to know about the secret skill of twin, so they all made guesses.</p><p>since we’ve already offended him, we can’t let him live. At the very least, we have to cripple his cultivation at any cost!</p><p>Wang Sheng opened his mouth. His heart was somewhat cold.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too terrifying. If they let him escape, he would be their nightmare when he grew up.</p><p>The other overlords all nodded.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and hai pengtian had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Hao pengtian, is this all you’ve got? How can you avenge your son?”</p><p>Lu Ming mocked and ridiculed as he fought.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Hai pengtian roared in his heart. He was shocked.</p><p>He had already tried his best but he still could not take down Lu Ming.</p><p>Although his cultivation was only at the early stage of the LV 4 martial Royal realm and his combat strength was considered weak among the LV 4 martial Royal realm experts, it was not difficult for him to kill a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. However, he could not take down a young junior even after a long time.</p><p>He started to feel a little anxious.</p><p>“Now is the time …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up. The nine Dragons bloodline suddenly collapsed, revealing Lu Ming’s true form.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands formed seals rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, a huge seal formed. It looked like the Imperial Jade seal used by emperors in the mortal world, but it was as large as a mountain. On it, chaotic light permeated.</p><p>This was the chaos sky-turning seal!</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal descended from the sky and pressed down on hai pengtian. Its terrifying power caused hai pengtian’s expression to change.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Hai pengtian shouted. The pair of golden wings on his back flapped rapidly, forming an infinite sharp Qi that blasted toward the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the primal Chaos sky-turning seal and hai pengtian’s attack collided.</p><p>At this moment, hai pengtian’s expression changed. The attacks he had sent out were constantly exploding and disappearing.</p><p>The chaos Empyrean seal was like a divine mountain from the primordial era, suppressing everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, hai pengtian’s attack was defeated, and the primal Chaos sky-turning seal landed on hai pengtian’s body.</p><p>Hai pengtian’s body trembled violently as he screamed. His body fell to the ground as blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Hai pengtian was no match for the primal Chaos sky-turning seal and suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>At this moment, Ming Lian seized the opportunity and charged towards hai pengtian. The million formation illustration covered hai pengtian, and at the same time, five Phoenix-feathered flying swords pierced through hai pengtian’s five vital points.</p><p>Hai pengtian tried his best to resist, but he had just been struck by the chaos sky-turning seal. His breath had not calmed down, and his whole body was in pain as if it was being torn apart. He could not exert much combat power at all.</p><p>He tried his best to resist, but his body was still pierced by the two Phoenix Feather flying swords, almost cutting his body apart.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>In the end, a piercing golden light bloomed. One of hai pengtian’s wings exploded, forming a terrifying storm that tore through the seal of the Ming Lian clone. He rushed out and flew into the group of people from the South God Palace. He continuously spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, his face as pale as paper.</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>A fourth level martial Royal realm Overlord had almost been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>It was too shocking.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. His combat strength was still insufficient after all. He had suddenly used the chaos sky-turning seal just now, but he had not been able to kill hai pengtian.</p><p>If sea ROC world had been a little more careful, it would have been even harder to kill.</p><p>His strength was still a little lacking compared to a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“The consumption of true essence is truly terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. A huge pile of raw gemstones appeared. Lu Ming activated his nine Dragon bloodline to devour the raw gemstones and refine them.</p><p>The primal Chaos sky-turning seal had consumed nearly 50% of Lu Ming’s quintessential essence.</p><p>In other words, given Lu Ming’s essential core, he could only use the chaos sky-turning seal twice before his essential core was exhausted.</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>A hegemon-level figure spoke.</p><p>Even hai pengtian could not find out if Lu Ming had set up a killing formation here. What would happen next?</p><p>“We’ll be able to probe it out if we send a few more people.”</p><p>Someone suggested.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
