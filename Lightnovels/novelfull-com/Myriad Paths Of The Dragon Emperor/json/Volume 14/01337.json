When he checked, he could not find any trace. He thought that he was hallucinating. Now, it seemed that Lu Ming had sneaked in at that time.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a corpse flew out. It was Zhao po.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing here?”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang was the most surprised. He looked at Lu Ming in surprise and disbelief.</p><p>He could not believe that Lu Ming would appear here. What was even more unbelievable was Lu Ming’s cultivation level.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was that of a ninth-level Alchemist and an Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming had already broken through to the Emperor realm?</p><p>No matter how much he valued Lu Ming, he still found it hard to believe.</p><p>It had only been a short while and Lu Ming had broken through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you should not have come!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang seemed to have thought of something and sighed.</p><p>“Let’s just kill this person first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>“You want to kill me? don’t even think about it. Lu Ming, you’re going deep into the holy city today. You’re dead for sure!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor roared and soared into the sky, trying to escape.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. At the same time, his body glowed and a large array appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out two fingers, put them together like a sword, and slashed.</p><p>A beam of sword Qi appeared out of thin air and soared into the sky in an instant, slashing at the horse-faced man.</p><p>Horse-faced Emperor was shocked and tried his best to block, but his domain couldn’t withstand a single blow from the sword Qi. The sword Qi didn’t stop and continued to slash at horse-faced Emperor.</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor screamed as his body was cut in half.</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor had fallen!</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others, who happened to catch up to them, as well as some other powerhouses from The Fiend clan, saw this scene. They immediately gasped.</p><p>He killed an Emperor with a single strike. What kind of battle prowess was this?</p><p>Not only Bai Shijin and the others, but even Xia Jiuyang and the Emperor of the Mosha clan were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming himself looked very calm.</p><p>Although he had just broken through to the Emperor realm, his battle-power couldn’t be calculated with common sense.</p><p>The second body of inscription was the cultivation of the Dao of inscription. Every level was perfect, and they all had ten spirit lamps lit.</p><p>Not to mention this, the second body had also inherited the inheritance of the profound sky Saint, who was a Saint.</p><p>Lu Ming took a second look. Regardless of whether it was his control of mental energy or the inscription formation, the power was shocking.</p><p>The killing formation that he had carved into his body was even more powerful.</p><p>Therefore, although the second clone had just broken through to the martial Royal realm, its combat strength was not weaker than the main body’s. It could fight with a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>With such combat strength, it was easy for him to kill an ordinary Lv 1 Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Sect … Zongzi?”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest stammered as they looked at Lu Ming. They were completely speechless and thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>It was already unbelievable enough to see Lu Ming here all of a sudden. The combat strength that Lu Ming had displayed was even more unbelievable. It was no wonder that they were stunned for a while.</p><p>“Senior white, senior du!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and gave them a fist salute.</p><p>“Zongzi, zongzi, it’s really you. You’ve broken through to become a ninth-rank Alchemist? Haha, great, great!”</p><p>“Our Talisman Amulet sect has finally given birth to a ninth-grade Alchemist!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others trembled with excitement and almost burst into tears.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing here? Di Yi and the Xie family were trying to lure you here!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang’s sudden words made Bai Shijin and the others ‘hearts skip a beat. Their expressions changed drastically, and the joy in their hearts disappeared without a trace. What was left was only worry.</p><p>of course I know that. However, it’s still unknown who will win today!</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained his plan.</p><p>“Alright, seniors, let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out. It was the Emperor of the Mosha clan.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Emperor of the Mosha clan, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The emperor’s expression changed. He was a little frightened by Lu Ming, but he still gritted his teeth and pointed at Xia Jiuyang and the others.”They can’t leave. This is the condition they promised me!”</p><p>“Eh? What are your conditions?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s like this …”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang started to explain.</p><p>It turned out that Xia Jiuyang and the others had been able to escape because of the conditions they had reached with the devil clan.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang, Bai Shijin, and the others had agreed to join The Fiend clan and help The Fiend clan fight against the Xie clan for five hundred years. In return, The Fiend clan would release the seal on Xia Jiuyang and the others.</p><p>That was the reason for the earlier scene.</p><p>Lu Ming roughly understood after listening to it.</p><p>The devil clan was trapped here by the Xie clan, and they were constantly being hunted down. The overall strength of the devil clan was far inferior to the Xie clan, so they could only hide in the abyss demon domain. Every second, a devil clan member was killed.</p><p>They had their eyes on the strength of Xia Jiuyang and the others. As long as they joined, their strength would increase greatly. In the future, they would have some confidence to fight against the Xie family, and the days of the devil clan would be better.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said, so, it’s because of this. Hehe, your devil clan is so passive that you’ll never be able to regain your freedom. You’ve heard it just now. I’m going to fight the Xie family. This is a chance for your devil clan. Why don’t you fight with me? as long as we destroy the Xie family, you’ll be free forever!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was full of temptation.</p><p>The emperor’s eyes flickered as if he was moved, but in the end, he gritted his teeth and said, ” although your combat strength is strong, the Xie family has a deep foundation. You will die if you fight the Xie family!</p><p>It was obvious that the Emperor of the Mosha clan did not believe that Lu Ming could fight the Xie family.</p><p>Xie Luan, the chaotic heavens divine warrior. I believe you know him. He’s my ally. I was the one who saved him from the abyss demon territory!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“What? Xie Luan is your ally? Will you also participate in the battle this time?”</p><p>The emperor’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Why should I believe you!”</p><p>The Emperor said. He had to be careful because this concerned the life and death of the entire clan.</p><p>If they followed Lu Ming to the final battle, it would be equivalent to putting the fate of the Mosha clan on the line.</p><p>“Her, do you believe her?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and Xie nianqing walked out.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming. Lu Ming transmitted his voice to Xie nianqing and explained the general situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
