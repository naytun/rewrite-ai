According to the task given to you by the family back then, if you could unify the continent group of the divine Ruins by yourself, you could return to the DI family and become a direct descendant of the DI family. Unfortunately, it seems that you have no hope!</p><p>...</p><p>Di Xian sneered.</p><p>Di Yi lowered his head even more, and his eyes flashed with raging anger.</p><p>It was all Lu Ming’s fault. It was all because of Lu Ming that he had ruined his plan.</p><p>The DI family originated from the yuan continent and was a powerful force there.</p><p>As for Di Yi, he was a branch disciple of the DI family, so his status was low.</p><p>However, there was a rule in the DI family.</p><p>As for those from the branch family, if they wanted to join the direct line, obtain the status of the direct line, and even obtain the cultivation conditions and resources of the direct line, they had to complete a task assigned by the DI family.</p><p>Di Yi’s mission was to unify the continent group of the divine Ruins with his own power.</p><p>This mission wasn’t considered to be very difficult among the missions of the DI family.</p><p>However, Di Yi’s talent was limited. He had come to the continent group of the divine Ruins ten thousand years ago.</p><p>However, at that time, his cultivation level had just broken through to the Martial Emperor realm. That was why he chose the divine wilderness continent, which was not very strong, to set up the Emperor sky divine Palace and begin his plan.</p><p>At the same time, he would strengthen his cultivation and cultivate the spirit body of ten thousand meridians.</p><p>Now, his plan was slowly maturing.</p><p>His cultivation had already reached the peak of the LV 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>He had obtained the myriad meridians spirit body by chance and was just one step away from perfection.</p><p>He was confident that as long as he obtained one more drop of the nine Dragons ‘blood essence, he would reach perfection.</p><p>At that time, he would be able to break through to the LV 3 martial Royal realm with the help of the myriad spiritual veins body.</p><p>By then, with his combat power, he could easily unify the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Even if he spent some more time, as long as his cultivation broke through to the fourth level of the martial Royal realm, it would not be a problem for him to unify the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>At that time, he would be able to return to the DI family and become a direct descendent of the DI family. His status would be greatly improved, and with the support of all kinds of resources, not only would his cultivation base improve by leaps and bounds, but even his bloodline’s status would also be different.</p><p>Unfortunately, everything was ruined by Lu Ming.</p><p>He had not been able to obtain Lu Ming’s nine dragon blood essence, so he had started the war rashly. He wanted to unify the divine wilderness continent first and use the entire divine wilderness continent’s power to help him cultivate the myriad meridians spiritual body.</p><p>However, in the end, Lu Ming still ruined everything. Even the ten thousand meridians spirit body that he had cultivated for ten thousand years was destroyed in a day.</p><p>He had no hope!</p><p>It was all Lu Ming!</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes turned red at the thought of Lu Ming.</p><p>“I also sent di hongcheng and di Honglei to help you. Where are they now? Do you know how much it costs to teleport from the yuan continent to a wild island like the continent group of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Di Xian shouted coldly again.</p><p>In his words, the divine Ruins ‘continent cluster became a Savage Island.</p><p>“Di hongcheng … They are dead!”</p><p>Di Yi stuttered.</p><p>“What? Where are the two Emperor spiritual weapons?”</p><p>Di Xian’s eyes widened, and his cold killing intent filled the air. Di Yi’s heart trembled.</p><p>Di Xian was the true direct descendant of the DI family. His status was much higher than his. If he was angered, not only him, even his own branch in the DI family would be in danger.</p><p>young master Xian, please calm down. It’s all that Lu Ming’s fault. If not for him, I would have been able to unify the continent group of the divine Ruins before long!</p><p>Di Yi quickly asked for forgiveness.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>Di Xian’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Yes, Lu Ming …”</p><p>Di Yi immediately told him about the previous battle and Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re saying that his cultivation hasn’t reached the Emperor realm? I didn’t think that a mere barbarian Emperor’s Island would have such a prodigy. This person must have some secrets. Hehe, take him down and I’ll study him!”</p><p>Di Xian’s eyes were cold.</p><p>let’s go. Di Yi, you lead the way. We’ll go to the divine wilderness continent and meet that Lu Ming!</p><p>Di Xian ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Di Yi nodded repeatedly and led the way. His face was ferocious.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming was still cultivating in the nine Dragon ruins.</p><p>As the days passed, the spirit God in Lu Ming’s dantian gradually calmed down. There was a faint glow, as if it was nurturing something.</p><p>On a certain day!</p><p>the spiritual God suddenly trembled, and a chaotic light flashed.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with ecstasy.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming put away the prison-suppressing stele and the third bloodline.</p><p>After such a long time, Lu Ming felt that the embryonic form of the chaos Domain had finally been condensed successfully.</p><p>He waved his hand and piles of raw gemstones appeared around Lu Ming.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared. It opened its mouth, and piles of raw gemstones were devoured by the bloodline of the nine Dragons and began to refine.</p><p>The energy of the origin stone was constantly transformed into true essence and integrated into the spiritual God.</p><p>The chaotic light in the spiritual God became more and more obvious.</p><p>After a few more days, Lu Ming had devoured three hundred million raw gemstones. The aura on his body was getting stronger and stronger, and his essential core was getting more and more abundant.</p><p>At a certain moment!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A circle of light spread out from the spiritual God and grew larger and larger. It covered a radius of a hundred meters from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Domain, the embryonic form of the domain had finally taken shape.</p><p>This was the embryonic form of the chaos Domain.</p><p>Right now, it was only an embryonic form. There was still a long way to go before it could form a real domain. In the future, Lu Ming would need to continuously comprehend and nurture it. Slowly, the embryonic form of the domain would become bigger and more mature. In the future, when he broke through to the Emperor realm, it would naturally become a complete domain.</p><p>With a single thought, the embryonic form of the domain shrank and covered the surface of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming casually threw a punch and the space collapsed, revealing a dark space cave.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the power of the embryonic Chaos Domain was much stronger than the pure chaos concept.</p><p>“Is this the power of an Autarch?”</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the majestic energy in his body and a confident smile appeared on his face.</p><p>After condensing the embryonic form of the domain, Lu Ming had naturally stepped into the Supreme-level.</p><p>His current strength was at least several times stronger than before.</p><p>He was confident that he could easily kill a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert with a King spiritual weapon, such as di hongcheng, without the help of his second body.</p><p>there’s less than a month before the Alliance establishment ceremony. It’s time to go back!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming immediately returned.</p><p>There were no obstacles on the way back. Lu Ming left the nine Dragons ruins easily. He tore open the space and soon returned to Northern Plains.</p><p>At that moment, the Imperial Dragon City was completed. The first thing Lu Ming did when he returned to the Northern Plains was to give the order to start moving to the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>Dragon Emperor City was very magnificent and vast. Many people could live there. Additionally, the cultivation conditions in Dragon Emperor City were very good. Of course, many people wanted to move there.</p><p>Regarding this, Lu Ming had already discussed with the various emperors and decided on the candidates to move to the Imperial Dragon City.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
