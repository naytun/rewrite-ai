They suffered heavy losses and could only retreat to this place.</p><p>In front of them, there were mountains that looked like divine swords. They rose from the ground and formed a barrier.</p><p>It was obvious that these mountains were pulled up from the ground by a peerless expert.</p><p>Between each sword-shaped mountain peak, there were huge chains that connected them. On the chains and the mountain peaks, there were dense inscriptions.</p><p>There were a few huge arrow towers on the peak of each mountain, and there were powerhouses guarding the towers.</p><p>This kind of arrow tower was not an ordinary one. It needed a raw stone as a Foundation and was activated by a martial arts master. When combined with a large array, it was extremely powerful and could even kill a spiritual God Realm master.</p><p>The space outside the sword-shaped mountain cracked open, and two figures appeared.</p><p>the heaven suppressing divine Army is indeed not simple. They can build such a huge project in just a few months!</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead and sighed.</p><p>the heaven suppressing divine Army has been fighting against the Xie family for tens of thousands of years. They must have their own reasons!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>At this moment, an explosive shout came from the sword-shaped mountain peak. Then, the air was torn apart. A few figures appeared in front of Xie Luan and Lu Ming, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The three figures that appeared were all Supremes, and their powerful auras locked onto Lu Ming and Xie Luan.</p><p>“You … You are the chaotic heavens divine warrior, Xie Luan!”</p><p>The three men’s expressions changed drastically upon seeing Xie Lun, and they cried out in alarm.</p><p>I have something to discuss with the hundred battles Martial Emperor. Please inform him!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Yes, please wait a moment!”</p><p>In the face of an Overlord like Xie Luan, the Supreme martial artists did not dare to show the slightest neglect. They quickly took out their voice transmission Jade talismans and sent out a message.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the time it took to brew a cup of tea, a few beams of light shot out from the depths of the sword-shaped mountain peak and appeared in front of Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Their auras were vast and unpredictable. They were all emperors.</p><p>The person in the lead had an even more vast and powerful aura, far stronger than an ordinary Martial Emperor. It was the baizhan Martial Emperor that Lu Ming had met before.</p><p>“Haha, brother Xie, what brings you here?”</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor laughed and looked at Xie Luan. Then, he shifted his gaze away from Xie Luan and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, his face changed, and he said, ” “You … Lu Ming?”</p><p>His words shocked the other members of the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>The young man in front of him was Lu Ming?</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s reputation was like the sun in the sky.</p><p>At such a young age, he was able to kill an Emperor and battle a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert. Such a prodigy had never appeared in the divine wilderness continent since ancient times.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current combat strength was already at the peak of the divine wilderness continent. He was the Overlord of a region.</p><p>How could the people of the heaven suppressing divine Army not be shocked?</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets the hundred battles Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists slightly.</p><p>you’re welcome, you’re welcome. Little brother Lu, you’re welcome!</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor quickly waved his hand and continued, ” it’s rare for little brother Lu and brother Xie to come here today. It’s really an honor. Come, please come in!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan nodded and followed the warring Martial Emperor and the others into the sword-shaped mountain.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the sword-shaped mountain peak, they saw that it was a mountain with rich spiritual Qi and all kinds of buildings.</p><p>In the vast mountains, Lu Ming could sense powerful auras. They were all experts.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Legion and some of their allies gathered together, so naturally, there were many experts.</p><p>Furthermore, there were many soldiers in iron armor patrolling everywhere. The military was in high spirits.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could see one thing in the strong and prosperous Army. It was the low morale.</p><p>Yes, their morale was low!</p><p>Not long ago, the heaven suppressing divine Army had suffered a crushing defeat. Even a few emperors had fallen. Their morale was naturally not very good.</p><p>Everyone came to a large hall and sat down in their respective positions.</p><p>Soon, more people came to the hall, all high-level figures of the heaven suppressing divine Army, at least Supreme figures.</p><p>There were even nine emperors.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army itself did not have that many emperors. That was because some of the Overlord forces had formed an alliance with the heaven suppressing divine Army. With the current situation in the divine wilderness, they would naturally gather together.</p><p>I didn’t expect that brother Lu and brother Xie would come here today. Come, let me toast to you two!</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor raised his wine cup and drank it in one gulp. He was quite forthright.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan also took a sip symbolically.</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor drank a cup of wine with a smile on his face. He then turned to Lu Ming and Xie Luan and said, If I’m not wrong, the two of you are here today for the holy city’s matter that will happen in seven days, right? ”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. The warring Martial Emperor went straight to the point, and Lu Ming also spoke frankly.</p><p>“Oh? I wonder what’s the purpose of you two coming to the heaven suppressing divine Legion?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor asked.</p><p>our purpose is simple. We invite the heaven suppressing divine Legion to fight against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family in the sacred city seven days later. We will decide the winner in one battle!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in a sonorous and powerful voice.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone in the heaven suppressing divine Army changed their expressions. The hall suddenly became silent.</p><p>After a long while, someone finally spoke.</p><p>“Fight against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan? It’s really laughable. Even if you all join us, you’re still far from being the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie family’s match. You’ll only be courting death if you go!”</p><p>An Emperor in armor sneered.</p><p>if we don’t fight with them, when the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and Xie clan form an alliance, they will attack the heaven suppressing divine Army and Northern Plains. At that time, we will still die, we will only be able to survive for a few more days!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>but seven days later, when we go to the holy city, we will die immediately. If we delay for a while longer, there might be a chance for us to turn things around!</p><p>The armor Emperor said.</p><p>The other members of the heaven suppressing divine Army did not say anything, but their eyes told Lu Ming that they had the same thoughts as the armor Emperor.</p><p>you’re just afraid of Di Yi and the two masters beside him. Let us deal with Di Yi and the two masters. You only need to deal with the Xie family. How about it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Are you going to deal with the three experts?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor’s eyes flickered with suspicion. He obviously didn’t believe it.</p><p>“Can you deal with those three experts? “Hehe, do you think we’re fools? I believe that the chaotic heavens divine warrior can deal with one person, but who can deal with the other two? Lu Ming, you?”</p><p>The king of armor looked at Lu Ming with disdain.</p><p>although it’s rumored that you can fight a Lv 2 Martial Emperor, the opponent has an Emperor spiritual weapon. Moreover, the rumors are exaggerated. Can you really fight a peak Lv 2 Martial Emperor? or do you really have the combat strength of an Emperor? ”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor said with a cold smile.</p><p>The others, including the battle Martial Emperor, looked at Lu Ming with suspicion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
