With a wave of his hand, the sky and earth collapsed. His power was much stronger than that of the armored Martial Emperor.</p><p>The combat strength of a Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert far exceeded that of a Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. He fused the five concepts and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the two fists collided, Lu Ming felt an immense force surge towards him. He could not help but be pushed back. The qi and blood in his body churned and he felt a sharp pain in his fist.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor stomped on the ground and continued to charge toward Lu Ming like an invincible God of War.</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor was also known as the hundred battles Martial Emperor. He had fought countless battles and had rich combat experience. His moves were simple, but they were extremely powerful. He could kill with one strike.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out the nine Dragons bloodline and performed the bloodline fusion to fight against the warring Martial Emperor.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought fiercely, from the ground to the sky, from the sky to the ground, and even to the other dimension.</p><p>Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage. He was no match for the warring Martial Emperor.</p><p>Although the baizhan Martial Emperor’s cultivation had not reached the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm, he was still at the middle stage. When Lu Ming used the chaos will, he could fight with a peak second level Martial Emperor if he used his full strength. However, when he did not use the chaos will, his combat strength was not as good as a baizhan Martial Emperor.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is this your full combat strength? If that’s the case, how can my heaven suppressing divine Army fight with you against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor’s voice rang out.</p><p>The Emperor sky divine Palace and the Xie clan had formed an alliance, so their next target would definitely be the heaven suppressing divine Army or Northern Plains. How could the battle Martial Emperor not know this?</p><p>However, if he wanted to fight with Lu Ming and the rest, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and the Xie family, he had to see hope.</p><p>Lu Ming was the hope!</p><p>If Lu Ming was really as powerful as the rumors said, what was the harm in making a bet?</p><p>if you want to see my full battle strength, there’s no hurry. You can’t defeat me now!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar and kept stepping out with his nine dragon claws. The power of the five martial arts techniques of creation was unleashed to the extreme, and there were even signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming’s five types of martial arts techniques were already at the peak of the fourth level. He was only a step away from the fifth level.</p><p>A battle-hardened Martial Emperor was a good training partner. After the battle with a battle-hardened Martial Emperor, Lu Ming’s five types of martial arts techniques seemed to show signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>“Then I’ll see how long you can hide it for?”</p><p>die! the warring Martial Emperor shouted coldly as a long spear appeared in his hand. The spear pierced through the air with even more astonishing power. An ordinary first level Martial Emperor would probably be killed in two moves.</p><p>The two of them crossed paths and exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>All of a sudden, one of the nine Dragons ‘claws grabbed the Spear’s tip, producing a clanging sound. The nine Dragons retreated, but the battlefields Martial Emperor’s burly figure also trembled and retreated a few steps.</p><p>“You’ve made a breakthrough in your martial technique?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor’s voice was filled with disbelief.</p><p>hahaha, thank you, Martial Emperor, for helping me make another breakthrough in my martial technique!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily, feeling extremely carefree.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>During the battle between Lu Ming and the warring Martial Emperor, he had a breakthrough in his martial arts technique.</p><p>This talent was too abnormal, right?</p><p>it’s just a martial technique that has broken through to a new level. Its power is limited!</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor’s voice was heard and he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and stretched out his Dragon Claw.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>After another exchange of blows with the warring Martial Emperor, Lu Ming retreated, but the latter also retreated, much more than before.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can its power increase so much?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor was in disbelief.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming was completely suppressed by the hundred-battle Martial Emperor. He had to Dodge most of the attacks and did not face them head-on. However, Lu Ming’s martial technique had only been upgraded by one level. How could its power increase so much?</p><p>Of course, he did not know that Lu Ming had not improved one martial arts technique but five.</p><p>Lu Ming had combined the five martial arts techniques. Therefore, when he broke through, he would break through with all five martial arts techniques at the same time. Naturally, his power would increase.</p><p>He wasn’t a match at all earlier, but now, he could barely hold his ground.</p><p>thanks for your help, Martial Emperor. It’s time to end this battle!</p><p>Lu Ming said. As soon as he finished speaking, a chaotic aura emanated from the nine Dragons.</p><p>Chaos intent!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>die! the nine Dragons used the prison suppressing heavenly art and swiped out with their claws, which were surrounded by chaos intent.</p><p>“Hundred-Battle God fist!”</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor put away his spear and performed his strongest unique skill.</p><p>In an instant, the baizhan Martial Emperor punched out 100 times. Each punch contained a monstrous combat power that could penetrate the earth and destroy mountains and rivers.</p><p>100 dazzling fist forces gathered in the air and merged into one fist force. Its power increased sharply.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force collided with the Dragon claws of the nine Dragons.</p><p>However, as soon as they came into contact, the battle Martial Emperor’s fist force was instantly crushed and exploded like a firework.</p><p>The Dragon Claw didn’t stop, crushing the void.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>As if struck by lightning, baizhan Martial Emperor vomited blood and was sent flying thousands of miles away, leaving a long dark space tunnel in the space.</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming in shock and then spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>The others were not any better.</p><p>Dumbfounded!</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor had been defeated. Was this Lu Ming’s true strength? He was so powerful that he had injured a hundred battles Martial Emperor with one move!</p><p>With such combat strength, he could really fight with a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert. The rumors were not exaggerated at all.</p><p>“Martial Emperor, do you want to continue?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice came out of the nine Dragons ‘mouths.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor sighed and shook his head. your combat strength is definitely comparable to the peak of the LV 2 martial Royal realm. If we continue fighting, I won’t be your match. Why are you embarrassing yourself? ”</p><p>After saying that, the aura of the hundred battles Martial Emperor was retracted.</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘bodies shrank, and Lu Ming returned to his original form.</p><p>“Good, good, good!”</p><p>Suddenly, an old voice rang out, saying “good” three times.</p><p>In the distant sky, a hunched old man stepped through the air.</p><p>The old man was very old. The White hair on his head was almost all gone. His skin was shriveled, and his face was full of wrinkles.</p><p>However, all the members of the heaven suppressing divine Army, including the battle Martial Emperor, hurriedly saluted the old man when they saw him, ” “Greetings, general!”</p><p>“General!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he sized up the old man with a hint of solemness in his eyes.</p><p>Although this old man looked very old, Lu Ming did not dare to underestimate him.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming could sense a terrifying aura in the old man’s body.</p><p>Peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>The old man was actually a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>I’ve long heard that there’s an old general in the heaven suppressing divine Army who has unparalleled battle strength. I’ve never seen him before. Today, I finally see him!</p><p>Xie Luan walked out, a smile on his face.</p><p>“I pay my respects to the chaotic sky Emperor!”</p><p>The old general saluted the chaotic sky Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
