A burly monk who was three meters tall appeared in front of him.</p><p>...</p><p>“Halt, this is the Holy Land of Buddhism!”</p><p>The burly monk was like a Buddhist Vajra. He stretched out his hand and blocked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Master, I’m lu Ming. I would like to pay a visit to your sect’s heartless master and the moonless female Bodhisattva!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said politely.</p><p>“Lu Ming? You’re the leader of the Dragon Alliance?”</p><p>The burly monk’s pupils shrank and a look of surprise flashed through his eyes.</p><p>“I’m currently under you!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So it’s Alliance Master Lu, but recently, Wu Liang and Wu Yue are both in closed-door cultivation, I’m afraid it’s not convenient to meet them!”</p><p>The tall and sturdy monk said.</p><p>“Still in seclusion?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. master, can you pass on the message? Lu Ming only wants to ask a few questions. I’ll leave after I’m done!</p><p>Alliance Master Lu, I’ve said that Wu Liang and Wu Yue are in seclusion. I’m afraid it’s difficult for them to meet!</p><p>The burly monk was very domineering.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened slightly.</p><p>It was just a meeting. Furthermore, with Lu Ming’s current status, he could be said to be the Overlord of the divine wilderness. However, the other party still wanted to stop him. There must be something fishy behind this.</p><p>Lu Ming was considering whether he should force his way in. Although the burly monk was at the first level Martial Emperor realm, he could not stop Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kong Jian, Let Alliance Master Lu in!”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice came from Bodhi temple. Then, Buddhist light filled the air and a kind-looking old monk appeared beside the burly monk.</p><p>A Halo of Buddhist light appeared above the old monk’s head. The powerful aura made Lu Ming’s pupils contract.</p><p>Third level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>This old monk’s cultivation was at the third level of the martial Royal realm. Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, there were still third level martial Royal realm experts other than Xie Luan.</p><p>The Western Desert really shocked Lu Ming.</p><p>If such an expert were to participate in the fight for hegemony in the divine wilderness continent, what would Di Yi have to do?</p><p>“Kong Jian greets Abbot Kong hai!”</p><p>The tall and sturdy monk greeted the old monk.</p><p>It turned out that this person was the abbot of Bodhi temple.</p><p>“Amitabha. I am Kong hai. Greetings, Alliance Master Lu!”</p><p>Master Kong hai said, paying his respects to Buddha.</p><p>you’re welcome, master. Lu Ming greets you! Lu Ming returned the greeting.</p><p>“Alliance Master Lu, please come in. I already knew that Alliance Master Lu would come this morning. I have already informed Wu Liang and Wu Yue to come out and see you!”</p><p>Master Kong hai said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. Without saying anything, he, Kong hai, and Kong Jian entered Bodhi temple. They sat down in an elegant courtyard and waited.</p><p>I have no hair. Lu Ming, long time no see. I knew you wouldn’t die!</p><p>Not long after, he heard a nondescript Buddhist chant. The monk and the moonless female Bodhisattva walked over.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At this moment, Kong hai and Kong Jian had left, leaving Lu Ming and the rest to chat.</p><p>“Heartless, what happened in the divine Ruins continent back then? The people from the South God Palace came to the divine wilderness continent and said that I was killed by a heaven’s pride expert of the deity sect because I offended him. Why didn’t any of you say anything?”</p><p>Lu Ming went straight to the point and asked the question in his heart.</p><p>“Hey, Lu Ming, you can’t blame me!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk cried out in injustice. back then, the ones who sent us back were experts from the great family, the Wang family, of the South God Palace. When the Wang family experts arrived in the divine wilderness continent, they ordered us not to speak nonsense.</p><p>as you know, the South God Palace is extremely powerful. They even have a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert. I don’t dare to disobey them. Moreover, that old monk Kong hai is also a timid person. So, he asked us to cultivate in seclusion and not pay attention to the outside world!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk had an exaggerated expression on his face. This guy called Abbot Kong hai as old monk Kong hai. What a weirdo.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>On the side, the moonless female Bodhisattva chanted the name of Buddha and pretended not to hear it.</p><p>“Also, Lu Ming, were you being hunted down in the South God Palace? At that time, I really thought you were dead!”</p><p>The monk continued.</p><p>“Oh? I can’t be bothered to pursue this matter, but what about Long Chen? Didn’t he come back with you? where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>sigh, Long Chen is probably dead too. He was taken away by the Wang family!</p><p>The monk sighed.</p><p>“The Wang clan?”</p><p>“Do you know why they took Long Chen away?” Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>The monk shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows were tightly knitted together. Could it be that he had offended the Wang family’s prodigy, Wang Zhen, and that was why the Wang family had taken their anger out on Long Chen?</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming. That’s all I know. You came at the right time. If you were a few days later, you wouldn’t have seen us!”</p><p>The monk said.</p><p>“Oh? You’re leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>that’s right. In a few days, moonless and I will go to the yuan continent and join a Buddhist sect there. Haha, I’m indeed the darling of the heavens, the reincarnation of a Buddhist Emperor. Lu Ming, I’ll catch up with you soon.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk laughed triumphantly.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It seemed that the waters of the Western Desert ran deep. They could actually contact the Buddhist sects in the yuanlu.</p><p>“Then we’ll meet in the yuan continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming took his leave.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>Over the past few days, Lu Ming had received news that an unknown expert had appeared on the shores of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and ordered the guards to be on high alert.</p><p>……</p><p>On the shore of the divine wilderness continent’s Eastern wilderness, a figure suddenly appeared. A terrifying aura emanated from his body, like the aura of an Emperor.</p><p>we’ve finally arrived at the divine wilderness continent. That Lu Ming should be there!</p><p>This figure was wearing a green robe and had narrow and sharp eyes. At this moment, there was a hint of greed in his eyes. With a shake of his body, he flew into the depths of the East continent.</p><p>Soon, he arrived outside ninedragons.</p><p>what a majestic city. There’s an Emperor here. I can ask around about Lu Ming’s whereabouts!</p><p>The green-robed man sneered and rushed into ninedragons. He appeared in the depths of ninedragons, exuding a vast aura that pressed down on ninedragons.</p><p>“What’s going on? It’s so strong!”</p><p>“Emperor, that’s the Emperor. Which Emperor from the Dragon Alliance has descended?”</p><p>In ninedragons, many people were suppressed by this aura and almost knelt down. Some of the weaker ones even vomited blood.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A loud shout came from the depths of ninedragons, and a burly man rushed out.</p><p>This burly man was qu Luo, who had been ordered to guard ninedragons.</p><p>When qu Luo saw the green-robed man, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Because he didn’t know the other party.</p><p>Now, the divine wilderness continent’s emperors, with the exception of those from the Western Desert, had all joined the Dragon Alliance. Qu Luo was familiar with every one of them, but he did not know this person. Clearly, he was not the divine wilderness continent’s Emperor and had come from overseas.</p><p>hehe, you’re finally out. Let me ask you a question. You’d better answer honestly. Otherwise, you’ll suffer!</p><p>The green-robed man chuckled.</p><p>“What do you want to ask?”</p><p>Qu Luo said.</p><p>“Have you ever heard of Lu Ming?”</p><p>The green-robed man said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
