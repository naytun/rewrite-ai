Among the younger generation, other than Lu Ming, brother Ming is the most powerful!</p><p>...</p><p>A voice suddenly rang out among the compliments.</p><p>The scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming’s name had a magical power that made everyone shut up.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, but no one spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name was like a huge mountain, pressing down on everyone’s hearts.</p><p>He was of the same generation as them, but with his current combat strength, he was able to kill an Emperor. He was able to fight against a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert. He was already standing at the peak of the divine wilderness continent, looking down on the world.</p><p>Among his peers, no one could compare to Lu Ming. The so-called geniuses here were far too inferior when compared to Lu Ming. The difference was too great.</p><p>Dark child’s face also darkened, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The young man who had just spoken turned pale and broke out in a cold sweat. He knew that he had said the wrong thing.</p><p>He had wanted to flatter Ming Zi but he subconsciously added Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>“Brother Ming. please forgive me, I … I didn’t mean to …”</p><p>The young man quickly apologized and stuttered.</p><p>It would have been better if he didn’t explain. The moment he did, Dark child’s face turned even gloomier.</p><p>“What an idiot, get lost!”</p><p>Xie Zhen berated, and the young man hurriedly took his leave.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming may be strong, but he doesn’t know how to judge the situation. He won’t live for long. He’ll die eventually. When that time comes, who in the world can compete with brother Ming?”</p><p>Xie Zhen continued.</p><p>Hearing this, Dark child’s face looked a little better.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming won’t be able to live for long!</p><p>he still wants to go against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan. He’s simply courting death!</p><p>even if such a brainless person has some combat strength temporarily, he’s still a brainless boor. In my opinion, he’s far inferior to brother Dark Child!</p><p>The others immediately followed suit and started to flatter him.</p><p>Dark child’s face revealed a smile again.</p><p>you’re right. Lu Ming’s talent is average. It’s just that he’s lucky, so his combat power is slightly stronger than mine. However, because of this, he’s arrogant and condescending. Back in the divine Ruins continent, he even dared to offend the pride of the yuan continent’s big sect, the tianshen sect. Such a brainless person will definitely have limited achievements!</p><p>even if he doesn’t die in the divine wilderness continent, he will be killed by the experts of the tianshen sect!</p><p>Dark Child said disdainfully.</p><p>“Brother Dark Child is right!”</p><p>“Brother Ming is right!”</p><p>The others were full of compliments.</p><p>“Brother Ming, how about I invite you to watch a good show?”</p><p>Xie Zhen said with a smile.</p><p>“Oh? What good show?”</p><p>Dark Child revealed an interested expression.</p><p>“Brother Ming, please wait!”</p><p>Xie Zhen laughed, and then his voice spread far and wide, ” “Bring the person up!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>yes! someone replied in the distance. Not long after, a group of Imperial Dragon guards led a dozen people over.</p><p>“Sun Lin, tie Xing …”</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed coldly.</p><p>The dozen or so people who were brought here were actually the law-enforcement officers that Lu Ming had met when he joined the law-enforcement Army in the holy city.</p><p>Tie Xing, the black Gorilla Man, Sun Lin, the middle-aged man who had been transferred to the law enforcement Army from the Imperial Dragon Guard with him by Xie Zhen …</p><p>At this moment, tie Xing and the others were in a sorry state. Their breathing was shallow and their faces were pale. It was obvious that they had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>Very quickly, tie Xing and the rest were brought to Xie Zhen and the others.</p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>Ming Zi was slightly stunned. He didn’t understand why Xie Zhen had brought more than a dozen burly men here.</p><p>“Brother Ming, these people are on very good terms with Lu Ming. They were his subordinates in the past!”</p><p>Xie Zhen said.</p><p>Xie Zhen, you’re despicable and shameless. You actually want us to slander the commander. You’re dreaming!</p><p>Tie Xing roared.</p><p>“Shut up, what slander?”</p><p>Xie Zhen berated. His eyes were cold as he said,”I’ll give you one more chance. Tell me, did Lu Ming use despicable means to kill others to cultivate his martial arts? also, did he specifically harm young girls and take their Yin to supplement yang? that’s why his cultivation improved so quickly. You’re his subordinates, so you should be very clear about it.”</p><p>“Let me remind you, before you speak, you’d better think carefully. Don’t forget the fate of your companions!”</p><p>Xie Zhen said coldly as he scanned tie Xing’s body with his cold eyes.</p><p>The expressions of tie Xing and the others were ugly, and a few of them looked terrified.</p><p>Bullsh * t! Don’t even think about slandering the commander. The commander is a man of indomitable spirit. Why would he do such a thing? ”</p><p>Tie Xing roared.</p><p>that’s right. The commander would never do such a thing. Don’t even think about using us to ruin the commander’s reputation!</p><p>“You’ve killed so many of our brothers. The commander will definitely come back to avenge us!”</p><p>Someone else also shouted.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming’s gaze turned colder.</p><p>He roughly knew what was going on.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming was on good terms with the law enforcement Army. It was obvious that Xie Zhen had taken down the law enforcement Army and wanted to force them to slander Lu Ming, saying that Lu Ming had done evil things like gathering Yin to supplement yang. That was why his cultivation level had progressed so quickly.</p><p>In that case, not only could he ruin Lu Ming’s reputation, but he could also enrage Lu Ming. There would be a higher chance of Lu Ming appearing at the Alliance ceremony in a few days ‘time, and he could then kill him.</p><p>However, the law enforcement Army did not obey.</p><p>Furthermore, from the conversation of the crowd, the other members of the law enforcement Army had already been killed by Xie Zhen. There were only a dozen or so people left.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s heart was as cold as a knife.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s expression was extremely gloomy as he berated, ” “I’ll give you one more chance. Tell me or not. If you don’t, die!”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it, I’d rather die than do such a despicable thing!”</p><p>Tie Xing roared.</p><p>The others also glared at him angrily, as if they were not afraid of death.</p><p>The law enforcement Army had a low status in the Imperial City and lived a miserable life. In order to survive, they had to please both sides and lived without dignity.</p><p>It was Lu Ming. Lu Ming was the one who made them hold their heads high and puffed out their chests.</p><p>After Lu Ming joined the law enforcement Army, they could finally hold their heads up high and enforce the law on behalf of the sage Emperor. They returned to the time thirty thousand years ago when the law enforcement Army dominated the world.</p><p>Therefore, they were very grateful to Lu Ming. They could not slander Lu Ming.</p><p>Xie Zhen, as a Prince, you did such a dirty thing. You’re really a disgrace to the imperial family and the Xie family!</p><p>Tie Xing continued to shout.</p><p>“Shut up! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Xie Zhen was furious. A saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at tie Xing’s neck.</p><p>He had brought tie Xing and the others over to curry favor with Dark Child, but he had not expected them to bite him back and damage his reputation. He wanted nothing more than to cut them into pieces.</p><p>The blade light was cold and as fast as lightning as it slashed towards tie Xing.</p><p>At this moment, tie Xing’s cultivation was sealed and his breathing was shallow. It was impossible for him to Dodge. In a moment, tie Xing’s blood was about to splatter and he would die under Xie Zhen’s saber.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At that moment, a wine cup flew out from the crowd and hit Xie Zhen’s saber.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>An inscription flashed on the wine cup, and it collided with the saber.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle saber trembled and hummed as it flew far away. Xie Zhen’s expression changed drastically as he retreated seven or eight steps and fell on his butt.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
