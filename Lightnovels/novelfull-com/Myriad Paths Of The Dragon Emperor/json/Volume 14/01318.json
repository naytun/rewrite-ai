What a terrifying sword Qi!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>He transformed into Nine Dragons and performed a martial technique that combined five types of concepts. Other than the chaos concept, this was Lu Ming’s strongest combat power. However, he still could not withstand it. He was pushed back a thousand miles by a sword gleam and three dragon claws were cut off.</p><p>The power of the golden sword radiance was truly terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the depths of the sky, a golden light flashed, and a figure appeared.</p><p>It was an old man with thick bone armor and a burly figure. He wore a long golden robe that fluttered in the wind, and his body exuded endless majesty.</p><p>The Golden-robed old man released a terrifying aura, causing the sky to shake.</p><p>peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>The Golden-robed old man’s cultivation was at the same level as Xie Luan and Di Yi’s Martial Emperor. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>There was a huge gap between each level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>The difference between the second level and the first level of the Martial Emperor realm was very obvious. It would not be too difficult for a second level Martial Emperor to kill a first level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Not to mention the peak of the second level martial monarch realm.</p><p>“Elder di hongcheng!”</p><p>The third underworld Emperor and the mountain breaker Martial Emperor were overjoyed to see the old man.</p><p>“Di?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Xie Luan had mentioned before that Di Yi suddenly had two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts with Emperor spiritual weapons. Lu Ming had a lot of questions.</p><p>It was not easy to find a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, on the surface, there were only two people, Xie Luan and Di Yi.</p><p>Where did the two people at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm beside Di Yi come from? moreover, they both had King spiritual weapons.</p><p>And now, he knew that one of them had the same surname as di? What was going on?</p><p>It was rumored that the Ditian divine Palace was founded by Martial Emperor Diyi. At that time, there was only one Martial Emperor Diyi, and no one had heard that he had any clansmen with the same surname.</p><p>Later on, did Martial Emperor Di Yi have descendants, which led to the DI family?</p><p>Could this old man be a descendant of Di Yi?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>This was because Lu Ming felt that the old man was older than Di Yi.</p><p>Lu Ming had more questions in his heart. He felt that Di Yi was more mysterious than he had imagined.</p><p>Di hongcheng stood high up in the sky and looked down at Lu Ming. However, it was not difficult to see that there was a hint of surprise and disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>He seemed to be in awe of Lu Ming’s age and combat ability.</p><p>“So, you’re Lu Ming. Lu Ming, it’s not bad for you to have such cultivation and combat strength at your age. I think you’re a talent. Join our di family. As long as you perform well, the DI family will not treat you badly!”</p><p>Di hongcheng said in a condescending tone.</p><p>This wasn’t di hongcheng’s intention. It seemed that he was born with the ability to look down on others.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled but did not answer. He stared at di hongcheng and said after a while, ” “You’re not from the divine wilderness continent, are you? Or are you not from the continent of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Lu Ming had seen all the paragons in the divine Ruins continent group, and there was no one with the surname di.</p><p>Di hongcheng was slightly stunned as if he did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly ask this question. Then, he sneered, ” “You don’t have to worry about this question. Now, just tell me, are you going to surrender or not?”</p><p>“Surrender? That’s fine, but I have a condition. Give me Di Yi’s head and I’ll surrender!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Di hongcheng’s face darkened, and his killing intent bloomed. He said in a cold voice, ” “Lu Ming, I see that you’re quite talented. I wanted to give you a chance, but you didn’t grasp it. I can only send you on your way!”</p><p>Di hongcheng clenched his fist in the air, and a golden combat sword condensed in the air. The sword Qi soared up into the sky.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! di hongcheng shouted. He swung his golden sword, and a terrifying sword Qi, thousands of miles long, split the sky and went toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was even more powerful than the previous one.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>The nine Dragons stomped in the air, and chaos Qi filled the air around them. The chaos will was unleashed.</p><p>In the face of an expert like di hongcheng, Lu Ming no longer hid his strength and unleashed it with all his might.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the prison-suppressing heaven technique and a Dragon Claw swiped at the golden sword radiance. The Dragon Claw was covered in the chaos concept.</p><p>Only when the chaos intent was combined with the prison suppressing heavenly art could its power be unleashed to its maximum.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon Claw collided with the golden sword radiance. It was as if the entire world was shaking as if the end of the world had arrived.</p><p>Half of the sky was filled with golden sword light, while the other half was in chaos.</p><p>Di hongcheng and Lu Ming’s figures were agitated by an invisible force and they retreated at the same time.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The mountain breaker Martial Emperor and the third hell-Emperor were dumbfounded by this scene. They could hardly believe their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked di hongcheng’s attack. Not only that, but they seemed to be on par with each other as they both retreated at the same time.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming could compete with di hongcheng. Lu Ming had not used his full strength when he was fighting with them.</p><p>At the thought of this, the two of them felt a chill down their spines. If Lu Ming had used his full strength earlier, they would have been dead for sure!</p><p>Gulu! Gulu!</p><p>In the White jade Palace of the Tianxia Academy, Kong Xin, goddess Tan Xiang, the two emperors of the Tianxia Academy, and other Masters all swallowed with difficulty. Their throats moved, and their eyes were wide open as they stared into the distance.</p><p>“AI! The gap between us and Lu Ming is getting bigger and bigger!”</p><p>After a while, Kong Xin sighed, her voice full of helplessness.</p><p>Lu Ming is not on the same level as us to begin with. He is destined to be more glorious and go further in the future!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>indeed, he is already standing at the peak of the divine wilderness continent at such a young age. I really do not know how high his future achievements will be!</p><p>An Emperor from the Tianxia Academy also sighed.</p><p>In the northern sky, Xie Luan and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Quluo’s body trembled, and he couldn’t say a word.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming’s ability to defeat quluo and crush ordinary sovereigns was already earth-shattering enough. However, they now realized that they had underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually fight with a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming’s combat strength was already on par with Xie Luan.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Among the crowd, Yan kuangtu was the most excited. He clenched his fists tightly and was extremely excited.</p><p>“I didn’t misjudge you!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He knew that he had made the right bet.</p><p>“Emperor’s sword, break the world!”</p><p>Di hongcheng’s angry voice was heard. He was actually forced to retreat by Lu Ming. This shocked him, but at the same time, it aroused his killing intent.</p><p>The golden sword radiance surged. Di Hong became one with the sword and turned into a dazzling sword radiance, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
