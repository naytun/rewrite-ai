It’s not an ordinary spirit body!</p><p>...</p><p>yes, Xia Jiuyang’s spiritual body is the rare nine yang divine body. It’s not an ordinary spiritual body!</p><p>Some of the emperors were discussing.</p><p>In the sky, Martial Emperor Di Yi and Xia Jiuyang had exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye. It was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>The more Martial Emperor Di Yi fought, the colder his eyes became, and the stronger his killing intent became.</p><p>“Evil disciple, die!”</p><p>Suddenly, Di Yi roared. A golden combat sword appeared in his hand, and the sword Qi suddenly soared.</p><p>“An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>The sword in Di Yi’s hand was undoubtedly an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Di Yi finally took out his King spiritual weapon.</p><p>What shocked Lu Ming was that the Emperor spiritual weapon in Di Yi’s hand was very similar to the one di hongcheng had taken out. They seemed to be the same type of Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Di Yi’s sword hit the Royal spirit tower and sent it flying.</p><p>Then, the sword slashed toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>After all, Xia Jiuyang’s cultivation was far inferior to Di Yi’s. After Di Yi took out his King spiritual weapon, he was no match for him at all. He was sent flying by the sword and spat out a large mouthful of blood. He was seriously injured.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was shocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Di Yi held the emperor’s spiritual weapon sword in his hand. His killing intent was as cold as a knife as he charged toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>He wanted to take Xia Jiuyang’s life.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming rushed out. As he rushed out, the nine streams of dragon energy in his body exploded. At the same time, the nine Dragon bloodlines and the third bloodline appeared at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into Nine Dragons. He twisted his body and pounced at Di Yi, clawing at him.</p><p>The Dragon Claw was covered in chaos intent.</p><p>Lu Ming almost used all his strength in this move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you want to save him, I’ll have to kill you first!”</p><p>Di Yi shouted coldly. His combat sword did not stop and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Dragon Claw grabbed the combat sword.</p><p>Lu Ming could sense a terrifying sword aura. It was extremely sharp and seemed to be able to destroy everything in the world.</p><p>The chaos will of the Dragon Claw shook violently and was finally cut open. The terrifying sword Qi pierced through the chaos will and landed on the nine Dragons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘huge bodies were sent flying hundreds of miles away. They stopped, and their bodies were covered with sword marks.</p><p>Di Yi controlled the king spiritual weapon and wielded it with all his strength. The power was really terrifying. Lu Ming could barely hold it down with all his strength, but his body with the nine Dragon bloodline was covered with wounds and almost collapsed.</p><p>The power of the bloodline circulated, and the wounds on the nine Dragons ‘bodies quickly healed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I told you. You can’t save him!”</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes were cold. He held his sword and continued to attack Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and wanted to save him again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A red-robed elder appeared in front of Lu Ming and slashed his sword at him.</p><p>“I’m your opponent!”</p><p>The red-robed old man was another expert at the peak of Lv 2 martial Royal realm beside Di Yi. His first move was extremely powerful.</p><p>“If you want to win by numbers, kill!”</p><p>On the other side, the Barbarian Emperor, qu Luo, and the others shouted as they charged toward the red-robed elder.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The emperors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace also moved, charging towards the Barbarian Emperor and the others.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s go and fight!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A chaotic battle broke out. The emperors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and Northern Plains started fighting. Each of them chose an opponent and flew into the sky, fighting.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Xie Luan and di hongcheng also made their moves. A blade light and a sword light almost tore the sky apart. The two of them fought high up in the sky, while the others stayed far away.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>On the other side, the Emperor of the Xie family and the heaven suppressing divine Army also started to fight.</p><p>The old general and Xie cangqiong engaged in a fierce confrontation.</p><p>As for the hundred battles Martial Emperor, he was fighting the old sage Emperor.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky above the sacred city was in chaos. Dozens of emperors attacked, and their destructive auras spread out for millions of miles.</p><p>In the sacred city, if it wasn’t for the protection of the endless inscription formation, and those emperors flying into the sky to fight, deliberately avoiding the sacred city, the sacred city would have long been reduced to ashes.</p><p>Even so, the destructive aura was too terrifying. It made countless people in the sacred city tremble and kneel down.</p><p>Even some of the Supreme martial artists ‘faces turned pale.</p><p>This kind of battle was too shocking. Even a Supreme martial artist couldn’t interfere. Once they were involved, they would be instantly turned into ashes.</p><p>Yan kuangtu, Xie nianqing, and the others looked up with worried expressions.</p><p>They wanted to interfere, but they realized that they couldn’t do so at all. They could only watch.</p><p>The Supreme-beings from all sides didn’t make a move. They just looked up into the sky.</p><p>They understood that the battle between the emperors in the sky was the battle that would determine the situation in the divine wilderness continent. Whichever Emperor won would be the winner.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘dragon claws struck out and exchanged a blow with the red-robed old man. They were evenly matched.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill Xia Jiuyang first, then you. No one can save you today!”</p><p>Di Yi sneered.</p><p>The situation was clear. Their peak combat strength had the advantage.</p><p>He and the red-robed old man were invincible.</p><p>Di Yi took a step forward and charged toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>“A battle to the death!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang shouted. He intended to fight Di Yi with his injured body.</p><p>“Tu Qian!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed. A burly figure appeared, holding a huge battleaxe, and chopped at Di Yi and Martial Emperor.</p><p>The power was shocking.</p><p>Di Yi’s pupils shrank. He had no time to deal with Xia Jiuyang. He waved his sword and hit the giant axe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Tu Qian and Di Yi’s bodies trembled and they retreated.</p><p>“Peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm? An Emperor spiritual weapon? No, it’s a puppet. Lu Ming, how do you have such a powerful puppet?”</p><p>Di Yi’s spiritual sense swept over tu Qian and he roared in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had such a powerful puppet with him.</p><p>Without a word, tu Qian raised his battle axe and charged at Di Yi.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Di Yi could only fight with tu Qian.</p><p>Tu Qian also controlled an Emperor spiritual weapon and was no weaker than Di Yi. The two strong people engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang’s entire body was covered in flames. The power of the divine Sun Stone continued to flow into his body, and his injuries were quickly recovering.</p><p>“Damn it, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The red-robed elder shouted as a golden combat sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>It was an Emperor spiritual weapon, and this sword was almost exactly the same as the one in Di Yi’s and di hongcheng’s hands.</p><p>This kind of Emperor spiritual weapon seemed to come in a set. Lu Ming was even more certain that Di Yi’s background was extraordinary.</p><p>Di Yi’s origin had always been mysterious. It seemed that he had suddenly appeared 10000 years ago.</p><p>“Who can you kill?”</p><p>Just as the red-robed elder took out his Emperor spiritual weapon and was about to attack Lu Ming, a clear voice came from behind him. A terrifying sword Qi slashed at the red-robed elder.</p><p>The red-robed old man was shocked. He turned around quickly and slashed out with his sword, dispersing the sword Qi.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The red-robed old man’s eyes narrowed and his expression changed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also behind him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s second body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
