His eyes were cold and his face was ferocious. He looked to the South and roared, ” “That damned b * stard. I’m going to tear that Lu Ming into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>It was fine if he was in the yuan continent, but in the divine wilderness continent, on this Savage Island, he actually suffered such a huge loss. Not only did he lose several Emperor spiritual weapons, he even fled in defeat. This was a huge humiliation.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core!</p><p>As for his dead subordinates, di Xian didn’t care at all.</p><p>In his eyes, those people were just dispensable ants.</p><p>In the DI family, such ants were too many to count.</p><p>The silver-haired old man’s eyes revealed a trace of sadness, but it disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“Young master, what should we do now?”</p><p>The silver-haired old man asked.</p><p>“What else can we do? Of course, we’re going back to the yuan continent!”</p><p>Di Xian gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Go back to the yuan continent and find experts to take revenge?”</p><p>The silver-haired old man asked carefully.</p><p>“Idiot, do you know how much it costs to transport some people from the yuan continent to this remote and desolate Island? The clan has already made an exception for me to teleport once. When I return this time, the clan will definitely not let me teleport again in a short period of time!”</p><p>however, it won’t be long. When I return and break through to the Martial Emperor realm, I will gain a certain status in the clan and come back again. Ten years, at most ten years. I will destroy the entire divine wilderness continent with that kid!</p><p>you’re courting death! di Xian roared ferociously. After a long while, he finally calmed down and flew toward white feather continent with the silver-haired elder.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming’s life had completely calmed down.</p><p>Every day, other than his own cultivation, he would be teaching his two disciples.</p><p>At times, he would also teach his parents, Hua Chi, and the others.</p><p>As for his second body, other than cultivating, he would occasionally open a forum and preach.</p><p>He had refined his second body, obtained a saint’s inheritance, and broken through to the Emperor level. His knowledge of the Dao of refinement was the best in the divine wilderness.</p><p>Therefore, every time the second clone of inscription opened a forum to preach, people who cultivated the Dao of inscription would swarm over.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others did not fall behind even once. There were even emperors who went to listen.</p><p>Lu Ming did not keep anything to himself. He shared his cultivation experience with her.</p><p>At the same time, Dragon Emperor City was also growing more and more prosperous.</p><p>The entire divine wilderness continent, the entire Dragon Alliance, was full of life. They were developing and growing.</p><p>Although, it could be said that the divine wilderness continent had the least emperors in history.</p><p>Other than Western Desert, there were also a few people from Xie clan, the Emperor of the entire Dragon Alliance was not even twenty.</p><p>However, given the current situation, it wouldn’t take too long for the number of emperors to slowly increase.</p><p>Now that the Dragon Alliance had unified the world, they had access to all kinds of resources and opened all kinds of cultivation Holy Lands to the public. The treatment that the top talents could enjoy was many times better than before.</p><p>In the past, the various Overlord forces had their own territories and their resources were extremely limited.</p><p>But now, he could choose any resources he wanted.</p><p>The cultivation speed of the young heaven’s pride experts had increased greatly.</p><p>The various emperors also shared their cultivation experiences with each other. He believed that this would increase his chances of breaking through to the Emperor realm in the future.</p><p>A month after the establishment of the Alliance, Yan kuangtu successfully broke through and became an Emperor. The Dragon Alliance now had another Emperor.</p><p>Two months after the establishment of the Alliance, Xie Luan had finally taken a step forward with Lu Ming’s help. His origin had been greatly restored, and his cultivation had finally recovered to the third level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>He had become the most powerful person in the Dragon Alliance after Lu Ming.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed since the founding ceremony.</p><p>In the past three months, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had steadily increased.</p><p>The early stage of the domain was growing day by day.</p><p>All sorts of martial arts techniques were also constantly improving.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that Lu Ming had fused nine drops of Nine Dragons Blood essence and absorbed the cultivation experience of the nine Dragons. He had finally cultivated the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps to the ninth step and achieved perfection.</p><p>As for the pure spirit body, he had also cultivated it to 70%.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also cultivating hard. He was improving quickly and was only one step away from the Supreme-being level.</p><p>However, dandan and bubbles were still in a deep sleep and had yet to wake up.</p><p>At this time, there was less than a year left before the two-year agreement to head to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“What happened to Long Chen and the others back then? Why did Long Chen disappear and only dark Child, the heartless monk and the other two returned? now that Dark Child is dead, only the heartless monk and moonless know. It seems that it’s time to make a trip to the Western Desert!”</p><p>In the Alliance master’s residence in the Imperial Dragon City, Lu Ming was drinking tea in a Pavilion in the courtyard, his thoughts flying.</p><p>He decided to find out where Long Chen was.</p><p>Long Chen was a good person and could be considered a friend of Lu Ming’s. Back in the divine Ruins continent, Lu Ming was also the one who implicated him. If Long Chen were to be harmed because of Lu Ming, Lu Ming would not be at ease.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>…..</p><p>The Western Desert had always been the domain of the Buddhist sect.</p><p>Almost everyone in Western Desert believed in Buddha.</p><p>Furthermore, the Western Desert had always been mysterious. It had never participated in the divine wilderness continent’s conflicts and stayed out of it.</p><p>But no one dared to underestimate Western Desert.</p><p>There was once an Emperor of an Overlord force that led an Army to attack Western Desert, but in the end, he never returned, not causing any commotion.</p><p>Even this time, when the divine wilderness continent entered a rare state of chaos, Western Desert remained uninvolved.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the Western Desert border, Lu Ming’s figure appeared.</p><p>Looking into the distance, Lu Ming’s figure was like a rainbow as he flew towards the depths of the Western Desert.</p><p>In the vast territory of Western Desert, there were countless temples and ancient temples.</p><p>Lu Ming’s target this time was the most ancient and oldest temple in the Western Desert, the Bodhi temple!</p><p>It was said that the unscrupulous monk and the moonless female Bodhisattva were both from the Bodhi temple and were cultivating in seclusion in the temple.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that it did not take long for him to cross more than half of the Western Desert.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming discovered many powerful auras.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered no less than twenty Supreme-being auras.</p><p>He even discovered two Emperor auras.</p><p>Lu Ming was flying in a straight line and he had already discovered so many experts. It was unbelievable.</p><p>Sometimes, there would be a Supreme martial artist in a small, dilapidated temple. It was truly astonishing.</p><p>It was said that Western Desert was second only to central continent in the five territories, it seemed that the rumors were true.</p><p>Not long after, a temple on a majestic mountain appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>They had arrived at the Bodhi temple!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
