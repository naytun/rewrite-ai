He slashed at the long sticks.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The staff hit Wu chengkong’s sword, which shook violently. In a few seconds, the sword collapsed and turned back into a human.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>run! Wu chengkong shouted in fear. He kept spitting out blood and tried to escape.</p><p>However, the long staff surrounded him from all directions, sealing off all his escape routes.</p><p>A few hundred sticks were thrown at Wu chengkong. Wu chengkong was completely drowned in the shadows of the sticks.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>A shrill scream reverberated throughout the drunken immortal garden.</p><p>Everyone who was watching the battle looked at each other.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>This result was completely different from what they had expected.</p><p>Wu chengkong was the strongest heaven’s favorite below the Big Shot heaven’s favorites. His cultivation had even reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm. How many people in the younger generation of the divine wilderness continent could be his match?</p><p>Furthermore, it was Lu Ming, a kid that she did not know at all? It was a matter of killing him in one move.</p><p>However, the result was completely beyond everyone’s expectations. Lu Ming had cast the same array.</p><p>But wasn’t the formation weak at the beginning? it couldn’t stop Wu chengkong at all. Why did it suddenly become so powerful? the staff became so powerful that even Wu chengkong couldn’t stop it.</p><p>The shrill screams were still echoing. After the time it took to brew a cup of tea, the hundreds of sticks disappeared, revealing Wu chengkong’s figure.</p><p>Tragic, it was really too tragic.</p><p>Everyone who saw Wu chengkong’s figure could not help but think of the word ‘tragic’.</p><p>Wu chengkong was lying on the ground like a dead dog. He had been hit so many times that his clothes were in tatters. His body was covered with rod marks. His face was like a pig’s head, his nose was broken, and his teeth were all gone.</p><p>If no one had said that it was Wu chengkong, no one would have recognized him.</p><p>Most importantly, Wu chengkong’s aura was extremely weak. His cultivation had been crippled.</p><p>The attack had destroyed Wu chengkong’s cultivation. He was now a cripple.</p><p>Many people gasped and shivered.</p><p>In particular, some second and third-grade geniuses could not help but step back. They looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>Who was this person? Where did he come from? how could he be so strong?</p><p>Furthermore, this person cultivated in the Dao of inscription. In the divine wilderness continent, there were countless geniuses in the Dao of inscription. There was no one who could defeat Wu chengkong.</p><p>They racked their brains but couldn’t figure out who this person was.</p><p>Could this person be Lu Ming? he had never heard of Lu Ming having such deep attainments in the Dao of inscription.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Dark child’s gaze was sinister as he stared at Lu Ming, trying to figure out something from Lu Ming’s expression. However, he was disappointed. Lu Ming’s expression was very calm and he could not figure out anything at all.</p><p>“Who am I? You don’t have the right to know!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>hehe, how arrogant. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you defeated Wu chengkong. I can kill him with a snap of my fingers!</p><p>Dark Child glanced at Wu chengkong and smiled disdainfully.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Dark Child stepped forward, his aura rising crazily.</p><p>Today was a banquet that was specially held for him, but Lu Ming had continuously attacked him, injured Xie Zhen, and crippled Wu chengkong. This was a complete slap to his face. He could not let Lu Ming leave alive.</p><p>The aura on his body was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Third level spiritual God Realm, fourth level spiritual God Realm, peak fourth level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>Even at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, he still did not stop.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dark child’s aura had reached the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>Dark Child, as expected of a giant-level prodigy. Your cultivation has actually reached the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Dark Child has awakened a ninth level divine rank bloodline. His combat strength is unparalleled. At the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm, he should be able to kill a high-level spiritual God!</p><p>“This is too shocking!”</p><p>Dark child’s body was filled with dark Qi. He smiled confidently and said, ” “Kid, I don’t care who you are. Today, I will die without a doubt!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A pitch-black scimitar appeared in Dark child’s hand. He moved and pounced at Lu Ming, slashing at him.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there, unmoving. This time, no inscriptions or formations appeared.</p><p>In an instant, Dark child’s scimitar was about to slash Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stretched out two fingers and gently cut at Dark Child.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword aura appeared between Lu Ming’s fingers.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The saber in Dark child’s hand was easily cut in half. The sword Qi didn’t stop and continued to cut toward Dark Child.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Dark child’s expression changed drastically. He could feel the threat of death from Lu Ming’s sword aura.</p><p>At this moment, his heart was trembling, and even his soul was trembling.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>he roared in his heart and retreated like crazy. At the same time, he used all his techniques to defend.</p><p>However, he immediately fell into despair.</p><p>The sword aura on Lu Ming’s finger could break through anything. All of his defenses were cut open like tofu. Then, he felt a chill between his eyebrows. The next moment, he fell into boundless darkness and lost consciousness.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The surrounding onlookers were baffled.</p><p>At first, they saw Dark Child attacking Lu Ming. Then, they saw a sword Qi burst out from Lu Ming’s finger. Then, they saw Dark Child retreating frantically. However, he had only retreated a few meters when his body stopped. He stood there, motionless.</p><p>Many people were confused and didn’t understand what had happened.</p><p>But immediately, everyone’s pupils enlarged.</p><p>Because at that moment, a blood mark appeared on Dark child’s glabella. The blood mark quickly grew longer, and then everyone saw Dark child’s body split into two and two halves.</p><p>He was dead. Dark Child was dead. He had been cut in half by a sword.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Dark child’s cultivation was at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm and he was also a Big Shot’s pride. With his combat strength, killing an existence at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm would be easy.</p><p>How could such a prodigy be killed by Lu Ming’s sword Qi as easily as killing a chicken? How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>“Who are you? Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Xie Yan and Xie Zhen were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they started to roar madly.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips slightly and the sword aura on his fingers disappeared.</p><p>This was a formation carved with his own body. With his Emperor cultivation, the formation he carved was naturally terrifying. Using it against Dark Child was really overkill.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An inscription flashed beneath Lu Ming’s feet. In the next moment, Lu Ming appeared in front of Xie Zhen.</p><p>“Ah, what do you want to do? This is the holy city, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Xie Zhen was so frightened that he shouted.</p><p>“I’ll search your soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. He stretched out a finger and pointed at Xie Zhen’s glabella.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming, Xie Zhen felt as if he was being crushed by ten thousand mountains. He could not move at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
