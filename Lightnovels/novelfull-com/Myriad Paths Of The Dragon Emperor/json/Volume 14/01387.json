But this place is extremely far from the divine Ruins. Let’s see how you’re going to escape? ”</p><p>...</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect glared at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with malevolence and cold killing intent.</p><p>“You didn’t return to the yuan continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, his mind highly focused.</p><p>The other party was right. This place was too far away from the divine Ruins. Even if he borrowed the bubbles to open a spacetime tunnel, he would most likely not be able to escape the other party’s pursuit.</p><p>Before he could even run into the divine Ruins, he was already chased and killed by the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>“It’s all because of you!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect seemed to have been stabbed in the heart by Lu Ming’s question. He roared in anger and said ferociously, it’s all because of you that I’ve been cursed and my cultivation has dropped. If I take the teleportation array in this state, the void will shake and the curse will penetrate deep into my bones. It’ll be difficult to get rid of it!</p><p>“How can I be satisfied if I don’t kill you?”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect became angrier and angrier as he spoke, and his killing intent grew colder.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that the other party should have been injured by the headless true dragon Knight in the core of the divine Ruins and suffered from the power of the curse.</p><p>A headless true dragon Rider was not a living being, but was formed from the undying battle intent of a Supreme expert.</p><p>Every move contained the power of the curse, which would constantly corrode one’s body and soul.</p><p>The burly man of the tianshen sect had been affected by the power of the curse, which was why he had not returned to Yuan continent.</p><p>it seems like you were the one who spread the news of me having a mixed essence token in the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he suddenly spoke.</p><p>He had always felt that this matter was strange.</p><p>If the people from the South God Palace had searched Long Chen’s soul and found out that he had the mixed energy token, they would definitely have sent experts to capture him. Why would it be so popular?</p><p>Now that he saw the burly man from the divine God sect, Lu Ming’s heart suddenly moved as he thought of a possibility.</p><p>It was very likely that the burly man from the heavenly God sect had fanned the flames and spread the news, hoping to kill Lu Ming with the help of others.</p><p>“Haha, that’s right, it’s me!”</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect laughed. He took a step forward and covered a hundred miles, approaching Lu Ming at an extreme speed.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated quickly, thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>the destruction of Dragon God Valley is also fake!</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>If the tianshen sect wanted to borrow the hands of others to get rid of Lu Ming, the first thing they had to do was to make Lu Ming’s identity no longer a deterrent.</p><p>Ji hongchen said that the tianshen sect had sent the news that Dragon God Valley had been destroyed. It was very likely that this burly man from the tianshen sect had also told them.</p><p>He had spread false news with the purpose of getting rid of Lu Ming with the help of others.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect said coldly.</p><p>“What a good scheme!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, it was all because of the scheme of the burly man from the divine God sect that Lu Ming had come to this point and was being hunted down by the entire continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Unfortunately, the burly man from the heavenly God sect had underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, he had no choice but to take action personally.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The burly man from the divine heaven sect was getting faster and faster. He surpassed Lu Ming and approached him at an extreme speed.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to let bubbles open a space-time Tunnel and head north. Tens of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, the burly man from the heavenly God sect was extremely fast. With a flash of light, he quickly chased after Lu Ming. The distance between the two of them was getting closer and closer.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>The other party was too powerful. There was too much of a difference between Lu Ming and the other party.</p><p>Any means would be useless in the face of Lu Ming’s absolute power.</p><p>Moreover, now that his second body was seriously injured and on the verge of death, his strength had also dropped greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming, run. Let’s see how you’re going to escape. And let me tell you, after I kill you, I’ll still go to the divine wilderness continent and destroy it. I’ll kill everyone in the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect spoke coldly, causing Lu Ming’s killing intent to surge.</p><p>Human lives were like ants in the other party’s eyes.</p><p>Today, even if Lu Ming was lucky enough to escape, the other party would still attack the divine wilderness continent. No one in the divine wilderness continent would be spared.</p><p>This was a lunatic!</p><p>“Dandan, is there any way?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming, I knew it. You would have designs on me again. I’m really sinful. I’m always implicated by you!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>“Is there any way?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>this person is cursed and his cultivation is only at Lv 6 Martial Emperor realm. If Xiao Budian cooperates with me with all his strength, we might have a chance to severely injure him. However, we will suffer heavy losses …</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m telling you, you have to compensate us in the future …”</p><p>Dandan mumbled to herself and then to bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At that moment, bubbles suddenly flew out. A layer of blood-red light suffused bubbles ‘milky-white fur and burned like flames, greatly increasing bubbles’ aura.</p><p>“Space-time spirit mouse, I’ll take you down first!”</p><p>Greed flashed in the eyes of the burly man from the heaven God sect. He waved the long sword in his hand and dozens of sword lights burst out. Like a cage, they enveloped the bubble.</p><p>Bubbles ‘two small claws grabbed at the air.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>The space trembled violently and split apart like pieces of crystal. In the end, it formed a spatial sword and slashed toward the man from the divine God sect.</p><p>The expression of the man from the heaven God sect changed. He did not dare to be careless. He changed the momentum of his sword and slashed horizontally.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>A total of nine space swords were cut open by the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>At this moment, dandan also made her move.</p><p>Like bubbles, dandan’s body was suffused with a blood-red light, raising her aura by a notch.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that dandan and bubbles were going all out. They had burned the power of their blood essence in their bodies to increase their strength in a short period of time. However, the repercussions were not small.</p><p>Dandan’s body became bigger than a mountain. Her two front claws slapped toward the burly man from the heavenly God sect. In the process of slapping, dandan’s claws were covered with inscriptions, forming a terrifying killing array that suppressed the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two extremely sharp sword lights flew out from the hands of the burly man from the heavenly God sect and slashed at dandan’s claws.</p><p>The array on dandan’s claw trembled and then collapsed. Dandan’s body flew out.</p><p>However, at the same time, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared around the burly man from the heavenly God sect and enveloped him.</p><p>“This is a good opportunity!”</p><p>Dandan let out a loud cry and opened her mouth. A ball of chaotic mist was blasted towards the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Within the chaotic mist, it was like a world. Mountains and rivers could be vaguely seen.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Just as dandan’s attack was about to land, ten thousand sword lights burst out from the transparent bubble and destroyed it in one fell swoop. The sword lights slashed at the world projection that dandan had spat out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The illusionary world that dandan spat out shook crazily and finally dissipated.</p><p>“Nest, kill!”</p><p>Dandan roared loudly. Her whole body was shining with a dazzling blood-red light. Between heaven and earth, nine huge turtle shells appeared and pressed down on the burly man from the tianshen sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
