It included the knowledge of many natural treasures and most importantly, the cultivation experience of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Jiu long was a powerhouse at the peak of the martial Supreme realm. How precious was his cultivation essence experience?</p><p>Lu Ming slowly digested the information.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed. Lu Ming finally opened his eyes.</p><p>There was a hint of solemness in his eyes.</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘memories also contained information regarding the chaos intent.</p><p>In the nine Dragons ‘memories, the chaos intent was the king of all intents in the world. It was extremely powerful, but it was also extremely difficult to cultivate.</p><p>Especially when it came to breaking through, it was extremely difficult to turn intent into a domain.</p><p>Lu Ming had known about this for a long time. When he used the domain solidifying pill back then, it did not have much of an effect.</p><p>Even if a normal martial artist did not have a domain solidifying pill, he could slowly dissolve the intent runes and merge them into his spiritual spirit in one or two years.</p><p>However, the difficulty of cultivating the chaos concept was more than a hundred times that of ordinary concepts. In other words, if Lu Ming cultivated step by step, he would need at least a hundred years to cultivate a prototype domain and step into the Supreme-level.</p><p>A hundred years was too long. It was too long for Lu Ming.</p><p>no, these 100 years are the golden years for me to practice. If I spend more than 100 years practicing the chaos will, it’ll be equivalent to killing my potential. Not only will the other geniuses leave me far behind, but my potential will also be exhausted, and my future achievements will be limited!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming gritted his teeth, a hint of ruthlessness in his eyes.</p><p>“Go all out! Let’s go all out!”</p><p>According to the cultivation experience of the nine Dragons, Lu Ming found a way.</p><p>This method could allow Lu Ming to condense an embryonic stage of the domain in a short period of time. However, it was very risky. If he was not careful, his cultivation would regress and it would be difficult for him to improve.</p><p>In the worst case, both his body and soul would be destroyed!</p><p>However, Lu Ming still decided to give it a try.</p><p>Any peak expert had experienced many difficulties and tribulations. No one had ever heard of anyone who could reach the peak smoothly.</p><p>Fight!</p><p>Lu Ming made his decision.</p><p>Moreover, it was right here.</p><p>Other than him, no one else should be able to break into this place. It was the best place to cultivate in seclusion and break through.</p><p>He closed his eyes. After a long time, Lu Ming’s heart sank into an empty state and he adjusted his condition to the best.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. With a loud roar, it rushed into Lu Ming’s glabella and appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Somewhere in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, a concept rune was suspended and it was filled with a chaotic radiance.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s chaos concept rune.</p><p>suddenly, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged near the chaos intent rune.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, the bloodline of the nine Dragons roared and pounced toward the chaos intent rune. A Dragon Claw grabbed the intent rune.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The intent runes let out a loud rumble. Lu Ming felt as if the entire world had been turned upside down, and a tearing pain came from his mind.</p><p>He only recovered after a long time.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted angrily. The nine Dragons continued to claw at the chaos concept runes.</p><p>Yes, this was Lu Ming’s method.</p><p>He used a brutal method to blast open the chaos runes and then used a brutal method to merge them into the spiritual God.</p><p>Such a method was absolutely crazy. If others were to find out about it, they would be scared to death.</p><p>But without a doubt, it was the most effective and time-saving method.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the nine Dragons were constantly attacking the chaos runes.</p><p>In the beginning, the nine Dragons only used one dragon Claw. Slowly, the number of dragon claws increased, and they used two, then three.</p><p>Ten days later, the nine dragon claws of the nine Dragons attacked the chaos runes together. The runes shook violently.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>At some point, the chaos intent rune made a cracking sound, and a crack appeared on it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, there was no panic in Lu Ming’s eyes. Instead, there was joy.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>The nine Dragons continued to bombard the runes.</p><p>As time passed, more and more cracks appeared on the runes.</p><p>Another ten days passed.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The chaos concept rune exploded, and blood spurted out of Lu Ming’s mouth. A crack even appeared between his eyebrows, and blood flowed out.</p><p>But Lu Ming could not care about that.</p><p>“Melt!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming roared. The spiritual God in his dantian emitted a strong suction force that attracted the chaos concept rune fragment to the spiritual God.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>all of the chaos intent fragments flew into the spiritual God.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual God swelled up and emitted thousands of rays of light, almost exploding.</p><p>This step was the most dangerous. If he was not careful, his spiritual spirit would explode, his physical body would collapse, and his soul would be destroyed.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>With a thought, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline appeared in his dantian. It floated above the spiritual God and suppressed him.</p><p>At the same time, the third bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Waves of energy enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the complete plan.</p><p>Lu Ming had no cultivation experience in the nine Dragons sect. He combined it with his own conditions and set up a complete plan. He used his three bloodlines to complete this step.</p><p>The spiritual God that was on the verge of collapse was finally suppressed and was fusing with the chaos intent fragment to form a domain.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and focused on cultivation.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>……</p><p>An endless distance away from the divine wilderness continent, in a hidden place on the White Feather continent, there was a messy Stone Forest. In the Stone Forest, there was an old stone platform.</p><p>Di Yi stood by the stone platform, waiting anxiously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, the stone platform began to glow. The glow grew brighter and brighter until it formed a vortex on the stone platform.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared from the Black Vortex. One, two, and in the end, a total of ten figures appeared and flew out of the vortex.</p><p>As soon as the ten figures flew out, the vortex on the stone platform disappeared.</p><p>As soon as he saw the ten people, Di Yi’s face immediately showed respect.</p><p>The leader of the ten people was dressed in luxurious clothes. His eyes were long and narrow, and when he opened and closed them, a sharp light flashed.</p><p>Behind the young man, there were nine people. There were old men and burly men. All of them had powerful auras, giving off an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>“Di Yi from the DI family’s side branch pays his respects to young master di Xian!”</p><p>Di Yi quickly bowed to the young man.</p><p>“You are Di Yi?”</p><p>The young man glanced at Di Yi with a faint disdain.</p><p>I am Di Yi! Di Yi said hurriedly.</p><p>Humph, Di Yi, you are really useless. You can’t even take down a divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Di Xian scolded coldly.</p><p>Di Yi’s face was ugly, but he did not dare to refute.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
