He was heading toward the elder in the purple-and-gold robe.</p><p>What was he doing? Was he trying to commit suicide?</p><p>Countless people were filled with doubts.</p><p>“I don’t care what you want to do. Go to hell!”</p><p>The purple-gold robed elder roared in his heart. He held the giant axe with both hands and poured his true Yuan into it. At the same time, he controlled his domain and activated the domain power within the giant axe, pushing its power to the extreme.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The huge axe, bigger than a mountain, came down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm in the face of the axe. He had no intention of using the lightning cauldron to resist.</p><p>“Prison suppression!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and the muscles in his body squirmed. The air of chaos permeated his body, especially at his fists, where the air of chaos was the densest.</p><p>The chaos will. Lu Ming had finally used the chaos will.</p><p>Lu Ming used his vital essence, nine streams of dragon energy, and the power of his third bloodline as the foundation to cast the prison-suppressing heaven technique. With the support of the chaos concept, he threw a punch.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist seemed to be moving slowly, but in reality, it was flying towards the elder in the purple-gold robe at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“What does Lu Ming want to do? He’s using his body to fight against an Emperor spiritual weapon?”</p><p>crazy, he’s crazy. He’s looking for death? ”</p><p>“A proud Son of Heaven has fallen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s action caused a commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming had abandoned the lightning cauldron and removed the blood fusion. In the end, he actually used his body to fight against an Emperor spiritual weapon. If he was not crazy, what was?</p><p>No one could figure out why Lu Ming would do such a thing.</p><p>haha, I don’t care what madness you’re going to have. Go to hell!</p><p>Hai Yu’s eyes were filled with excitement. His face was ferocious, but he was laughing in his heart.</p><p>In the entire place, only one person, no, only one turtle, saw through the trick, and that was dandan.</p><p>“Then … That’s the chaos will. When did Lu Ming master the chaos will?”</p><p>Dandan’s mouth was agape and tongue tied, her pair of turtle eyes wide open, full of disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Lu Ming’s fist collided heavily with the Emperor spiritual weapon battleaxe.</p><p>Everyone had imagined that Lu Ming would be crushed like dried weeds and rotten wood, that he would be severely injured by the axe, or even killed. However, the scene did not appear. Instead, it was an unbelievable scene.</p><p>The fist and the battle-ax collided. The battle-ax actually made a violent roar and kept shaking.</p><p>At this moment, the elder in the purple-gold robe seemed to have suffered a terrible blow. His arms and even his body trembled with the giant axe. Then, his face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant axe trembled. The old man in the purple-gold robe could no longer hold the giant axe. The giant axe left his hand and flew into the sky.</p><p>There was complete silence between heaven and earth.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Their eyes were wide open, and their mouths were agape. It was as if something was stuck in their throats, and they couldn’t make a single sound.</p><p>chaos will. It really is the chaos will!</p><p>Only dandan was mumbling to herself.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles was harmless. She blinked her innocent eyes and seemed to be cheering for Lu Ming.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Xie nianqing said softly. Even though he knew that Lu Ming had successfully cultivated the chaos concept, he was still shocked by the power.</p><p>As for Supreme Thunder Rhino, he was completely petrified.</p><p>the power of Chaos intent is indeed shocking!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>It was said that the heaven and earth were evolved from chaos. There was chaos Qi in the heaven and earth, which was the most original and most precious treasure. It was said that a wisp of chaos Qi could collapse the sky and destroy mountains.</p><p>The chaos will also had the characteristics of the chaos Qi. It was extremely heavy and powerful. Combined with the prison suppressing heaven skill, they complemented each other well. With a punch, he sent the elder’s giant axe flying and injured him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. He stepped forward, surrounded by chaos intent, and punched again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky began to collapse wherever Lu Ming’s fist passed, as if a black hole had appeared in the sky.</p><p>Chaos intent spread out and completely locked onto the elder in purple and gold.</p><p>the violet-gold robed elder’s expression changed as he roared and punched with all his strength, hoping to block it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment the two fists met, the purple-and-golden-robed elder’s domain shattered under the terrifying pressure.</p><p>Then, it broke through the fist force of the elder in the purple-gold robe and landed on his fist.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking could be heard. Even though the elder in the purple-gold robe had cultivated a spirit body, it was useless. His palm was deformed, and his entire arm was twisted.</p><p>The old man in the purple-gold robe screamed as he was sent flying hundreds of miles away. His face was pale and he spat out blood.</p><p>However, the old man in the purple-gold robe did not dare to stay. He turned around and ran.</p><p>“Wind elemental technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and his figure was like a Phantom. In a flash, he approached the elder in the purple-gold robe at extreme speed. From a hundred miles away, he threw a punch.</p><p>As the fist force pressed forward, the space within a few hundred miles in front of Lu Ming was smashed. The terrifying fist force surged towards the elder in the purple-gold robe like a raging flood.</p><p>This was the suppression of power. It was simple and direct, but there was no way to Dodge.</p><p>The old man in the purple-gold robe could only counterattack with all his might.</p><p>However, he had lost his Emperor spiritual weapon. Even if Lu Ming did not use the chaos will, he could still suppress him. He was not Lu Ming’s match at all.</p><p>The fist force crushed over, and the old man in the purple and gold robe rolled in the air like a little chick. His body made a crackling sound, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“It’s time to end this!”</p><p>A deep voice came from Lu Ming’s mouth. He cast the wind element technique and appeared in front of the elder in the purple-gold robe in an instant. He held the void in his hand and the chaos concept condensed into a long spear. The long spear was like lightning as it pierced toward the elder’s dantian.</p><p>“No, spare my life …”</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe roared, but Lu Ming was not moved at all. He thrust his long spear down.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear condensed by the chaos will was extremely sharp. It easily broke through the opponent’s spiritual body and pierced through the dantian, piercing through the opponent’s spiritual God.</p><p>The power on the spear exploded, and the elder in the purple-gold robe let out a miserable scream. However, after only a breath, there was no more sound, and his life force disappeared.</p><p>The old man in the purple-gold robe, the Emperor of a generation, was dead!</p><p>“The heavens …”</p><p>When the surrounding people saw this scene, they already felt numb and were completely unable to say a word.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Hai Yu roared. His eyes were bloodshot and he couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“It’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on Hai Yu. He moved and headed toward him.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Hai Yu’s body turned cold and he ran away like a madman.</p><p>However, even the Emperor could not escape from Lu Ming’s hands. Furthermore, Lu Ming’s wind element technique had extreme speed. He caught up with Hai Yu in an instant and threw a punch. The chaos will suppressed Hai Yu. Hai Yu screamed in pain. His body was torn apart and his spiritual God exploded.</p><p>A Supreme Being like Hai Yu, who had awakened a ninth level divine level bloodline, could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
