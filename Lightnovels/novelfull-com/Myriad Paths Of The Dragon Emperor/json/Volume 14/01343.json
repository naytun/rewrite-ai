Then, a lightning cauldron appeared and enlarged rapidly, smashing toward the red-robed elder.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons twisted their bodies, and chaos intent permeated the air. They used the prison suppressing heavenly art, and their nine dragon claws clawed at the red-robed elder.</p><p>At the same time, Ming Lian moved. He took a step forward and countless inscriptions appeared in the air. More than a dozen formations appeared at the same time. More than a hundred giant chains formed and wrapped around the red-robed elder.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The red-robed elder struck out with his palm and sent the lightning cauldron flying. At the same time, he slashed horizontally with his golden sword, cutting off more than a hundred chains.</p><p>But at this moment, the nine Dragons attacked.</p><p>The nine dragon claws were suffused with a chaotic light and crushed the space. The red-robed elder was shocked by the power.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi whistled and mysterious runes appeared on minglian’s body, forming a terrifying killing formation. In a flash, he shot out nine rays of sword Qi. Each ray of sword Qi was terrifyingly powerful, causing the red-robed old man to be afraid.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body had the same consciousness. When they worked together, it was seamless.</p><p>The red-robed elder’s pupils contracted as he controlled his Emperor spiritual weapon to release dozens of sword Qi that covered his entire body.</p><p>Although the power of the Emperor spiritual weapon was strong, the power of the dozens of sword Qi was greatly reduced after the energy was dispersed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘dragon claws slashed down, and more than a dozen sword Qi were destroyed.</p><p>On the other side, the sword Qi that the second body slashed out also collided with the dozen sword Qi and dissipated.</p><p>However, as soon as the sword Qi disappeared, another formation appeared in the sky.</p><p>This time, there were both trapping and attacking formations. The dense light flooded towards the red-robed elder.</p><p>The red-robed elder could only counterattack with all his might.</p><p>For a moment, the red-robed elder was completely passive.</p><p>The combat strength of Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body was equivalent to the peak of the second level martial Royal realm, which was on par with the red-robed elder. However, when the main body and secondary body worked together, it was not as simple as one plus one equals two.</p><p>The combination of the two, one martial Dao and the other inscription Dao, was seamless. All kinds of trapping and attacking techniques poured down on the enemy like a storm, leaving the enemy no chance to breathe.</p><p>Even though the red-robed elder was controlling the Emperor spiritual weapon, he could not form an effective counterattack at the moment. Under Lu Ming’s storm-like attacks, he could only protect himself.</p><p>This caused many of the spectators to be shocked.</p><p>The two Lu Mings had joined forces to suppress a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert who had an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>On the other side, tu Qian completely disregarded his life and launched a crazy attack, firmly entangling Di Yi.</p><p>At this time, Xia Jiuyang’s injury had almost recovered. He joined the battle and attacked Di Yi with tu Qian.</p><p>The battle had entered a state of anxiety.</p><p>The two sides fought intensely, and it was hard to tell who would win.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the red-robed elder were engaged in an intense battle, a faint air-piercing sound was heard behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, a black sword light broke through the space and suddenly appeared behind the nine Dragons, stabbing at them.</p><p>This time, it was very sudden. When the sword light stabbed, there was almost no fluctuation, and its speed was amazing.</p><p>The nine Dragons wanted to Dodge, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The black sword light pierced into the bodies of the nine Dragons, and the terrifying sword Qi surged wantonly.</p><p>At the same time, a black-robed figure appeared.</p><p>This person was skinny and his face was pale. His face was filled with ferocity.</p><p>die, Lu Ming! Die! How dare you kill my son, Dark Child! Die!</p><p>The man roared with a ferocious expression.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The bodies of the nine Dragons collapsed.</p><p>but before the black-robed man could celebrate, a stone stele appeared, and an aura even more powerful than the nine Dragon bloodline exploded.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline shook and hit the black-robed man. At the critical moment, the black-robed man blocked it with the black sword in his hand, but his body was still shaken and he was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“First hell-Emperor, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s murderous voice came from the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline.</p><p>The black-robed man was the first underworld Emperor of the southern underworld. He was very powerful and had reached the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>However, he was only at the early phase of the second level of the martial Royal realm and did not have an Emperor spiritual weapon. Lu Ming did not take it to heart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the red-robed old man finally seized the opportunity and slashed out with his sword. The sword Qi slashed at the bottom of the prison suppressing stele bloodline. There was the remnant body of the prison suppressing stele bloodline, which was indestructible.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele vibrated. With the help of the power of the red-robed old man, it flew far away in the direction of the first emperor of the dead.</p><p>The first hell-Emperor was shocked and wanted to escape.</p><p>However, a formation suddenly appeared in the void in front of him. Hundreds of chains wrapped around him.</p><p>Ming Lian made his move.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>The first emperor of the dead shouted as he slashed out with his thin black sword, trying to cut the chains apart.</p><p>However, his cultivation was far inferior to the red-robed elder’s, and he didn’t have an Emperor spiritual weapon. He only managed to cut off a few chains, and more chains wrapped around him.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele had already arrived. It was filled with the chaotic will and was about to suppress the first emperor of the dead.</p><p>he dares to be distracted. Just in time to get rid of one. Kill!</p><p>On the other side, the red-robed old man was overjoyed, and his eyes emitted a ferocious light.</p><p>The sword Qi of the combat sword in his hand surged and he attacked Ming Lian’s second body.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming’s decision to kill the first emperor of the dead was foolish.</p><p>This way, he could kill the second one first. As long as he killed one, the other one would not be a threat.</p><p>A terrifying sword light slashed towards the second body.</p><p>However, the second figure’s expression was calm. He took a few steps back, and wherever he passed by, a formation appeared.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>The red-robed elder slashed out with his combat sword. It was as if he was breaking dry weeds and smashing rotten wood. He split apart the great formations and attacked them one after another.</p><p>The killing formation on the second body glowed even brighter. Sword Qi shot out, but they were all split apart by the red-robed elder’s combat sword.</p><p>The red-robed elder approached Lu Ming’s side rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, Ming Lian’s clone’s glabella lit up. Two sword lights suddenly appeared and shot toward the red-robed elder at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Moreover, the cry of a Phoenix could be heard from the two sword lights.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The red-robed elder’s heart trembled. These two sword lights gave him a sense of danger, and all the hair on his body stood up.</p><p>At the critical moment, he could not be bothered to chase after Lu Ming. He retracted his combat sword to defend and slashed at the two sword gleams.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions as the two sword radiances were sent flying by the red-robed elder. However, his arm was also slightly numb.</p><p>“What a powerful force. This is …”</p><p>The red-robed old man was secretly shocked. When he saw the true body of the two sword lights, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p>They were two small swords, about the length of a palm, and they looked like two Feathers.</p><p>The faint cry of a Phoenix could be heard.</p><p>That’s right, these two small swords were made from Phoenix Feathers.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
