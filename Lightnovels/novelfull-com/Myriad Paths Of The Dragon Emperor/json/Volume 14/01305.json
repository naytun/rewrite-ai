The people who were watching the battle only reacted now. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>The Emperor had been killed by Lu Ming. This outcome was beyond everyone’s expectations and it was too shocking.</p><p>He was an Emperor!</p><p>In history, there were also peerless geniuses who could jump levels to fight. It wasn’t rare to see someone in the Supreme-being realm jump levels to fight against an Emperor.</p><p>However, it was only a great battle. It was only a resistance, not a suppression.</p><p>There were very few Supremes who could suppress emperors.</p><p>Not to mention killing an Emperor.</p><p>Even if an Emperor couldn’t defeat it, they would still have a good chance of escaping. Moreover, Supreme martial artists cultivated spirit bodies and had extremely strong vitality, making them very difficult to kill.</p><p>There were only a few cases of Supremes killing emperors in the divine Ruins continent since ancient times.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm. A great circle of the spiritual God Realm could kill an Emperor. Such an example had never happened in the continent group of the divine Ruins. There were no records of it and it was unheard of.</p><p>Lu Ming had already created history!</p><p>Countless pairs of eyes were looking at Lu Ming, filled with shock and fear.</p><p>“Which one of you still wants to stop me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p>All the powerhouses, including the Supreme-beings, lowered their heads immediately after meeting Lu Ming’s eyes. They did not dare to look him in the eye.</p><p>The powerhouses who entered the underwater ancient city knew that Lu Ming had obtained the cultivation method of the pure spirit body, but none of them dared to say anything.</p><p>What a joke. Lu Ming had even killed an Emperor. Whoever spoke up would be courting death.</p><p>“In that case, Lei Xi, let’s go!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming stored the corpse of the elder in the purple-gold robe into the mountain and river diagram, then returned to the back of the lightning rhinoceros Supreme.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros let out an excited roar, and lightning crackled around his body. He spread his four legs apart and sprinted toward the ocean.</p><p>He was excited!</p><p>Now, he was full of admiration for Lu Ming. He had no second thoughts. He had already made up his mind to follow Lu Ming for the rest of his life. Even if Lu Ming chased him away, he would follow Lu Ming shamelessly.</p><p>A great circle of the spiritual God Realm was able to kill an Emperor. Such a genius had never appeared in history.</p><p>In the future, becoming an Emperor was a sure thing. It would even be easy for him to dominate the continent group of the divine Ruins and become the strongest expert.</p><p>He could even cause a wave in the yuan continent and become an important person.</p><p>Supreme Thunder Rhino would be an idiot if he didn’t follow a genius with such boundless prospects.</p><p>As long as he stayed by Lu Ming’s side obediently, he would definitely benefit from Lu Ming’s rise in the future.</p><p>Originally, he had no hope of breaking through to the Emperor realm, but now, a glimmer of hope appeared in his heart.</p><p>Thump thump thump …</p><p>Supreme Thunder rhinoceros ran with all his might, his body crackling with lightning. He streaked through the air like a bolt of lightning, piercing through the ocean and heading deeper into the ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing sat cross-legged on the back of the Thunder Rhino Supreme, as steady as a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve cultivated the chaos will. Amazing, really amazing. I know. In the ancient city in the deep sea, you disappeared for more than ten breaths. At that time, a primordial chaos token appeared. Were you brought to the chaos Hall by the primordial chaos token? ”</p><p>Dandan jumped onto Lu Ming’s shoulder and mumbled a bunch of questions.</p><p>Dandan was worthy of being an existence at the level of an old monster. She was experienced and knowledgeable, so she guessed the general situation right at once.</p><p>“That’s right, you didn’t guess wrong!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>impressive, Lu Ming. I was right about you. It seems that you have already obtained the legacy of that guy, chaos!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“Dandan, you know the chaos Thearch?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course I do. That guy is very powerful. He is on the same level as me!</p><p>Dandan placed her claws behind her back and said proudly.</p><p>“You can continue bragging!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>He had learned from Earth One that the chaos Thearch was one of the peak existences in the world and few could compare to him. Even the hall Master of the time and space spiritual Hall, time and space spirit rat, was slightly inferior to the chaos Thearch.</p><p>Dandan and the space-time spirit rat were equally famous. They were one of the top ten war beasts. How could they be compared to the chaos Thearch?</p><p>who’s bragging? I’m the head of the top ten Battle Beasts, the peak existence in the world!</p><p>Being looked down upon by Lu Ming once again, dandan shouted unhappily.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not argue with dandan any further. With a wave of his hand, a pile of corpses appeared on the back of the lightning rhinoceros Supreme.</p><p>They were the bodies of the Supreme-beings that Lu Ming had killed and the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about you leave these corpses to me? This is a rare tonic that can help this Lord recover a portion of his strength!”</p><p>Dandan looked at the corpses, especially the emperor’s corpse, and almost drooled.</p><p>“For you?”</p><p>“I have use for the blood essence. I can give you the rest!” Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline was only at divine level level level eight. It needed blood essence to level up. As for the rest, they were not of much use to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was at the great circle of the spiritual God stage. The next step would be to comprehend the embryonic stage of the domain and step into the Supreme stage.</p><p>This step could not be improved by devouring with the nine Dragon bloodline. It had to be comprehended by oneself.</p><p>In fact, his future cultivation could not be improved by devouring. Comprehension was the most important.</p><p>Therefore, other than the blood essence, the blood of a Supreme Emperor, vital essence energy, and so on were useless to Lu Ming. He might as well give them to dan dan.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out some Jade bottles and directed them with his vital essence. The blood essence from the Supreme-beings ‘corpses flew out and into the Jade bottles.</p><p>There were a total of seven Supreme martial artists. Each Supreme martial artist had nine drops of blood essence, which were stored in different Jade bottles.</p><p>Finally, it was the blood essence of the old man in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>As an Emperor, the elder’s blood essence was like a blood-colored Pearl, filled with endless energy. As it flew out, a vast and boundless Imperial pressure was emitted.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s fault. If it was an ordinary martial artist below the spiritual God Realm, they would have been shaken to death by this kind of Imperial pressure.</p><p>An ordinary spiritual God Realm warrior would be seriously injured.</p><p>Only those at the advanced spiritual god level and above could get close and collect the blood essence of the Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming used a Jade bottle to store the blood essence of the Emperor.</p><p>As for their storage rings, Lu Ming naturally did not let them go. He had already kept them.</p><p>“Dandan, you can have it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Dandan laughed and opened her mouth. The corpses of the Supreme martial artists and emperors were all sucked into her mouth and disappeared.</p><p>“I’ll keep it and slowly digest it!”</p><p>Dandan grinned, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>Then, dandan’s eyes started to size up the sea again.</p><p>the treasures in the ocean are more than ten times more abundant than those on land. There are countless rare treasures. I can’t miss this trip!</p><p>Dandan muttered.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles called out in response to dandan.</p><p>haha, good. We’ll work together to get more treasures!</p><p>Dandan grinned and pulled bubbles to the side to discuss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
