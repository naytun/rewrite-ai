He had killed the first emperor of the dead, the red-robed elder, and fought Di Yi. Slowly, the situation changed and they slowly gained the upper hand.</p><p>After that, the Xie clan summoned the nine Heavens bronze man, and the situation changed drastically. At that time, they thought that they were going to lose, that there was no hope for this battle.</p><p>However, at the critical moment, Lu Ming turned the tide and destroyed the nine Heavens bronze man in one fell swoop. He killed the nine emperors of the opposing side. This time, the situation was completely reversed. They had secured victory.</p><p>Without Lu Ming, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>Hearing the commotion, Xie Qitian, the old divine Emperor, and the rest trembled slightly. They also looked at Lu Ming with complicated gazes.</p><p>It was all because of this young man that the Xie clan had fallen to such a state.</p><p>Back then, it was Lu Ming who had rescued Xie Luan. Xie Luan had thrown out the Heavenly King’s token and changed the situation in the divine wilderness continent. It had also disrupted the Xie family’s plans, directly leading to the Great War that followed.</p><p>And this time, the Xie family had been completely defeated because of Lu Ming.</p><p>were we wrong? was it worth it because of the purity of the bloodline? ”</p><p>The old divine Emperor seemed to have aged even more. He let out a long sigh, and when his voice fell into Xie Qitian’s ears, it caused him to feel even more complicated.</p><p>Yes, was it worth it?</p><p>Speaking of which, he was not the cause of all this. If he had treated Xie nianqing well, Lu Ming might have been with the Xie family and even become one of them.</p><p>Then, it was not impossible for the Xie family to rule the divine wilderness again.</p><p>It was all because of him.</p><p>He had personally turned Lu Ming into an enemy. At this moment, he did not know what to feel.</p><p>“Lu Ming, where’s Di Yi?”</p><p>Xie Luan walked toward Lu Ming and asked him telepathically.</p><p>“He escaped!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“He escaped?”</p><p>Xie Luan was slightly stunned. it doesn’t matter. Di Yi’s vitality has been greatly damaged. He can’t cause any more trouble!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“General Lu, how should we deal with these people from the Xie family? Kill or not?”</p><p>An Emperor asked Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming’s position in the hearts of the crowd had become very important, even surpassing that of Xie Luan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Xie nianqing.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing was looking at Xie Qitian and the others. What was he thinking?</p><p>“Little Qing, I’ll leave them to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to Xie nianqing and said.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with hesitation.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He had already guessed this outcome.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression was cold and ruthless, like a demoness, but deep down, he was still very emotional.</p><p>Xie Qitian was her father, after all. The old divine Emperor was her grandfather, her family.</p><p>Although the Xie family was heartless to her, she couldn’t bring herself to do it.</p><p>general Lu, miss nianqing, the Xie family has a long history, deep foundation, and many masters. It’ll be a disaster if we keep them!</p><p>“That’s right. I suggest that we kill them to avoid any future trouble!”</p><p>……</p><p>The other sovereigns also voiced their suggestions.</p><p>“You don’t need to do anything!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Xie Qitian spoke, as if he had made a decision. He stepped forward, exuding a powerful aura and dignity.</p><p>This was the dignity of a Sage Emperor.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s gaze swept across the crowd, and his voice rang out from afar, ” I am the Saint Emperor, the Saint Emperor of the ancient Saint dynasty. Even if I die, I will not die in your hands, and I will not die in the hands of anyone else.</p><p>After saying that, Xie Qitian pointed his finger at his dantian.</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from his body, but it quickly weakened.</p><p>At first, it was a Martial Emperor, then it dropped to a Supreme martial artist, and then it continued to drop to a spirit God, a spirit embryo …</p><p>In the end, Xie Qitian’s body did not have any true energy or true Qi fluctuations, and he became an ordinary person.</p><p>He had actually crippled his own cultivation.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xie Qitian spat out a mouthful of blood and fell limply to the ground.</p><p>He, as the sage Emperor, had to die with dignity. Even if he died, he couldn’t die at the hands of others.</p><p>Finally, Xie Qitian looked at Xie nianqing with a complicated expression, as if he was reminiscing. After a while, he said, ” nianqing, I’ve let you down in this life. I’ve let your mother down!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body trembled at his words.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s age had long surpassed that of an ordinary person. Now that his cultivation had been crippled, he did not have much time left.</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s small hand and he slowly calmed down.</p><p>sigh, forget it, forget it. In this world, there is no eternal dynasty, and there is no family that will exist forever!</p><p>The old divine Emperor sighed, then looked at Lu Ming, Lu Ming, the Xie family is willing to make a blood oath. All direct descendants of the Xie family are willing to seclude themselves in the palace. The palace will be sealed and they will not take a single step out of the palace for ten thousand years. From then on, we will no longer be involved in the divine wilderness. Can you spare the Xie family? ”</p><p>“Seal yourself in the palace for ten thousand years and never step out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Xie clan was no longer a threat, not to mention that they had sealed themselves for ten thousand years.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that he could destroy the Xie family with a flip of his hand in ten years, let alone ten thousand years. After ten thousand years, Lu Ming’s realm would be beyond imagination. Why would he care about the Xie family?</p><p>The other emperors didn’t say anything.</p><p>It was a given that Lu Ming would become an Emperor. He would have a lifespan of ten to twenty thousand years. After ten thousand years, Lu Ming would not care about the Xie family. What could the Xie family do?</p><p>Immediately, the old divine Emperor, Xie cangqiong, and the others all took blood oaths.</p><p>The other higher-ups of the Xie family, such as the Supreme-beings and the spiritual God Realm experts, all made a blood oath.</p><p>“Disciples of the Xie family, follow me into the Imperial Palace!”</p><p>As the old divine Emperor’s voice rang out, all of the Xie family’s direct descendants followed the old divine Emperor into the palace. After that, a light screen appeared outside the palace, enveloping it within.</p><p>The Xie family would seal themselves for ten thousand years and would not be allowed to step out of the palace.</p><p>The battle had finally come to an end.</p><p>In this battle, more than half of the divine wilderness continent’s sovereigns had fallen. More than sixty to seventy percent of the various Overlord factions had been wiped out.</p><p>It could be said that the divine wilderness continent had never been so weak, with so few sovereigns.</p><p>“Go! Let’s go back to the hundred beasts tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, pulled Xie nianqing, and left.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Legion, the Emperor of Northern Plains, followed Lu Ming and headed to Northern Plains.</p><p>And news of this battle spread from the holy city to the entire divine wilderness continent at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent was shaken!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
