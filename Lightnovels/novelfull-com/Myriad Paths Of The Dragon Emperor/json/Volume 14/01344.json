Lu Ming called them the Phoenix Feather flying swords.</p><p>The Phoenix Feather flying sword was incomparably sharp and indestructible. Its power was astonishing.</p><p>Just now, he had used two swords to force the red-robed old man to defend himself.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>On the other side, a scream was heard.</p><p>The first emperor of the dead was no match for Lu Ming. Under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline, the first emperor of the dead’s body cracked and blood spurted out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed down for the second time. The first emperor of the dead’s body was torn into pieces, and his spiritual spirit was also blown apart. His body and spirit were destroyed.</p><p>The strongest Emperor of the southern underworld became the first emperor to be killed after the battle began.</p><p>The one who killed him was Lu Ming!</p><p>In the sacred city, countless martial artists who saw this scene could not help but gasp.</p><p>The number one emperor of the underworld of the southern underworld. In the past, he was definitely an unrivaled figure who could move unhindered in the world. With a stomp of his foot, not just the southern underworld, but the entire divine wilderness continent would be shaken by him.</p><p>In the past, such a figure was like a legend, weighing down on the hearts of countless Warriors. He was a figure that made everyone tremble with fear when mentioned.</p><p>However, such a peerless figure had died just like that. He had been killed by an even stronger expert.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After killing the first emperor of the dead, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele trembled and suppressed the red-robed elder.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The red-robed old man roared in his heart. His sword Qi madly slashed towards the second body.</p><p>However, his second body cultivated the Dao of inscriptions and had many methods. All kinds of formations appeared continuously, some to trap the enemy, some to disturb the enemy, some to defend, some to attack, and all sorts of attacks.</p><p>At the same time, the second body’s killing formation and the two Phoenix Feather flying swords were shockingly powerful. The red-robed elder did not dare to be careless. For a moment, although he forced the second body to retreat, he could not do anything to the second body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele had arrived and was pressing down on the red-robed old man. Above it, the chaos will crushed over and the void was collapsing, making it difficult for the red-robed old man to breathe.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The red-robed old man held the sword with both hands and slashed at the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled, and it was sent flying.</p><p>However, the terrifying power of the prison-suppressing stele also made the red-robed old man’s expression change. It was as if he had been hit by hundreds of mountains, and his body was forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>On the other side, the second body had also arrived.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The two Phoenix Feather flying swords were extremely sharp and as fast as lightning. They were almost invisible to the naked eye as they stabbed at the red-robed elder. The red-robed elder used 120% of his energy to block them.</p><p>The space fluctuated, and the second body walked in the air, approaching the red-robed elder step by step. With every step, a large array appeared in the void.</p><p>“He’s too difficult to deal with!”</p><p>The red-robed old man’s heart was trembling. His eyes were filled with anger and he felt extremely aggrieved.</p><p>Lu Ming was too difficult to deal with.</p><p>In terms of combat strength, he had an Emperor spiritual weapon and was definitely stronger than Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body were no match for him. He would be suppressed or even killed.</p><p>However, when the two of them were used together, their power would increase by several times and they would have endless means. Even if he had combat strength, he would not be able to use it. If he was not careful, he would be in danger.</p><p>die! he roared and burst with genuine vitality. He madly slashed out with the combat sword in his hand. Golden sword light kept slashing out in all directions, forming a terrible storm of sword Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>One after another, the formations were broken and destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body sneered coldly. They did not attack. Instead, their secondary body inscribed arrays and bombarded the red-robed elder.</p><p>Controlling an Emperor weapon was an extremely taxing task, and his true essence would not last long under the red-robed elder’s ferocious attacks.</p><p>Sure enough, a moment later, the red-robed old man began to pant heavily as his true essence was severely consumed.</p><p>no, we can’t go on like this. I’ll meet up with Di Yi first. We’ll work together and cooperate. The situation will be much better!</p><p>The red-robed elder thought to himself. He realized that he would be too passive if he were to fight Lu Ming alone. He would not be able to unleash his full power. If he were to cooperate with the others, he would be able to kill Lu Ming with lightning speed.</p><p>Thinking of this, he was about to rush toward Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body had cold glints in their eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele that Lu Ming’s main body had transformed into glowed brightly. It was as large as a mountain and was surrounded by a chaotic artistic conception. A powerful force surged into his third bloodline.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele unleashed the prison-suppressing heavenly art and launched a powerful attack at the red-robed elder.</p><p>At the same time, he shouted and two Phoenix Feather flying swords flew toward the red-robed elder.</p><p>As for the second body, the patterns on its body formed a terrifying killing formation. The second body was the core of the killing formation, and endless sword Qi surged and gathered into one.</p><p>The second body turned into a beam of sword Qi and attacked the second body.</p><p>Lu Ming launched his most powerful attack at the red-robed elder.</p><p>“Emperor sword, destroy the firmament!”</p><p>The red-robed elder madly circulated his true essence and slashed out two times. Two sword Qi as large as mountains slashed at the main body and the second body.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The prison-guarding stele collided with a sword Qi. The sword Qi dissipated, and the prison-guarding stele flew out.</p><p>On the other side, it was a battle of sword Qi. Sword Qi whistled and shot out in all directions.</p><p>The two Phoenix Feather flying swords and the second body were also blocked.</p><p>However, at this moment, three more sword lights shot out from the second body’s glabella.</p><p>There were three more Phoenix Feather flying swords.</p><p>The three Phoenix Feather flying swords were beyond the red-robed elder’s expectations.</p><p>The two sword strikes just now were at the moment when he was exhausted and needed time to catch his breath. However, Lu Ming had long calculated the timing and grasped it perfectly. At this moment, he launched a fatal blow.</p><p>The red-robed elder’s pupils rapidly contracted as he roared in his heart, ” “No…”</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The three Phoenix Feather flying swords pierced through the red-robed elder’s body.</p><p>One was from his glabella, one was from his heart, and the other was from his dantian.</p><p>All three places were vital points.</p><p>The red-robed elder’s eyes widened in disbelief. He could not believe that he would die in this battle, killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the red-robed old man’s corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>A peak Emperor at the second level of the martial Royal realm with an Emperor spiritual weapon had been killed.</p><p>The sacred city was in an uproar.</p><p>This was a battle that could turn the tide of the battle. The Empyrean heaven divine Palace had lost a peak expert in battle. Who could stop Lu Ming next?</p><p>High up in the sky, the battle between the sovereigns was getting more and more intense.</p><p>There were also casualties among the emperors.</p><p>Some of the sovereigns were injured, and there were even sovereigns who died on the spot, their blood spraying through the sky.</p><p>The battle was extremely tragic.</p><p>The usually high and mighty Emperor was going to be bathed in blood and killed today. If he was not careful, he would die.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
