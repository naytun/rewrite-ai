Their combat strength reached the peak of Lv 2 martial Royal realm, instantly turning the tide of the battle.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Di Yi took advantage of Lu Ming’s distraction to burst out. His body was burning like a flame. He broke out of the encirclement and flew high into the sky.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the ones who will die today. You’re no match for me!”</p><p>Di Yi roared, his body filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Gather, gather together!”</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor gathered everyone.</p><p>The Xie family’s Foundation was too shocking. No wonder it was said that the holy city had never been breached in the history. Who could rival such a powerful Foundation?</p><p>Under the control of the nine martial emperors, the nine bronze men were equivalent to the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm. Nine peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm … How powerful was their combat power?</p><p>Baizhan Martial Emperor, tu Qian, Xia Jiuyang, barbarian Emperor, Yuexin Martial Emperor, and the others gathered together and looked at the nine bronze men cautiously.</p><p>“Kill, exterminate them!”</p><p>Xie Qitian gave the order.</p><p>Kill! Kill!</p><p>The nine bronze men were three meters tall. They stepped in the air, and the air they stepped on exploded continuously. They formed an arc and headed toward the baizhan Martial Emperor and the others.</p><p>Beside them were Xie Qitian and the rest of the sovereigns.</p><p>“They’ve won. The Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace will definitely win!”</p><p>there is no longer any suspense in this battle. From now on, the divine wilderness continent will be the world of the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!</p><p>In the sacred city, many people who were watching the battle sighed. They felt that there was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>The Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would definitely win. With the appearance of the nine bronze men, the outcome of the battle was set.</p><p>Some people sighed. This battle was too exciting. In the battle of the emperors, even the lives of emperors were like grass. Up until now, more than ten emperors had fallen.</p><p>This battle would be recorded in history and spread throughout the ages.</p><p>“A battle to the death!”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tu Qian held a battle axe in his hand as he charged towards a bronze man and chopped down with his axe.</p><p>As for the bronze man, he punched out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Tu Qian controlled the Emperor spiritual weapon, and his battle strength was even stronger. He sent one of the bronze men flying with his axe.</p><p>“I’m not injured!”</p><p>The hearts of the warring Martial Emperor and the others trembled.</p><p>Although tu Qian had sent one of the bronze men flying and had the upper hand, the bronze man was completely fine. Only a shallow mark had appeared on his fist.</p><p>It was too hard. Even an Emperor spiritual weapon couldn’t damage it, so how could they fight it?</p><p>A hint of despair flashed in the eyes of the warring Martial Emperor and the others.</p><p>three of us will deal with this puppet. The others, kill them all. Don’t let a single one of them go!</p><p>A voice came from one of the bronze men.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A few of the bronze men started to surround tu Qian, while the others attacked the baizhan Martial Emperor and the others.</p><p>Suddenly, two figures appeared in front of the warring Martial Emperor and the others.</p><p>They were Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s main body had already returned to its human form.</p><p>“Leave these nine bronze men to me. You guys go deal with the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Ah? What?”</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor and the others were stunned.</p><p>The nine bronze men were given to Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to deal with the nine bronze men alone? How was this possible?</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong and he might be able to deal with two or even three of them, how could he be a match for so many Nine Heavens bronze men?</p><p>These were nine bronze men at the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm. They were so hard that even an Emperor spiritual weapon could not break them. Even a third level Martial Emperor might not be able to do anything to them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if we work together, there might still be hope!”</p><p>“That’s right. It’s too dangerous for you to be alone!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor, Martial Emperor Yuexin, and the others chimed in.</p><p>“Kill, kill Lu Ming first. Since he’s looking for death, then kill him first!”</p><p>High up in the sky, Xie Qitian shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine bronze men charged at Lu Ming one after another. When the nine bronze men attacked together, they seemed to be able to shatter some of the metal.</p><p>“Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, suppress!”</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head. They opened their mouths and roared. Nine huge cauldrons appeared from the mouths of the nine Dragons. As soon as the cauldrons appeared, they grew rapidly and were as large as mountains. They smashed toward the nine bronze men.</p><p>the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron! You brought the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>In the sky, Martial Emperor Di Yi shouted in fear.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which had never moved, was refined by an ancient expert to suppress the nine dragon veins.</p><p>In history, Lu Ming was the only one who had made the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron move once, and he had done so by relying on his nine-Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Even Di Yi, who had obtained a drop of nine dragon blood essence, had refined it into his body in order to practice the spiritual body of ten thousand meridians. Therefore, he could not touch the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Moreover, if the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was too far away from the nine dragon veins, the Dragon veins would riot, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron would fly back.</p><p>Most importantly, why didn’t anyone in ninedragons tell Lu Ming that he had taken the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron?</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron pressed down on the nine bronze men.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The nine bronze men attacked at the same time and punched out.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>It was as if two metal mountains had crashed into each other. The sound waves from the collision of metal made some ordinary emperors pale, and the true essence covering their bodies trembled.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the nine bronze men were sent flying far away like a cannonball.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>Xie Qitian and the others were stunned.</p><p>The nine bronze men fell to the ground. They were no match for Lu Ming and were sent flying. How was this possible?</p><p>On the other hand, the expressions of the warring Martial Emperor and the others were completely different. They were all ecstatic.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as the nine Cauldrons continued to press down on the nine bronze men.</p><p>Back when Lu Ming was still in the spiritual ocean realm and his nine Dragon bloodline was only at the second level of the divine level, he could control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to fight against a Supreme. In the end, the nine Cauldrons gathered and he could even fight against Di Yi’s avatar.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was many times stronger than it had been in the past. His nine Dragon bloodline had also reached the ninth level of the divine level. Naturally, the power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron he controlled was many times stronger.</p><p>He completely crushed the nine bronze men.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron pressed down on the nine bronze men. The bodies of the nine bronze men trembled violently. The patterns on them emitted a brilliant light, as if they were burning.</p><p>However, in just a few breaths, it seemed to have been completely burned out, and the light on the bronze man’s body quickly dimmed.</p><p>Then, with nine consecutive bangs, the nine bronze men exploded.</p><p>The nine Heavens bronze men, the nine bronze men forged by the first Saint Emperor of the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty, finally exploded into pieces under the bombardment of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The nine sovereigns who had fused with the bronze men and controlled them didn’t even have time to scream before they were turned into ashes.</p><p>The nine bronze men had been destroyed.</p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent. Everyone seemed to be in disbelief at the scene they had just seen.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a corpse fell from the sky.</p><p>Di hongcheng, it was di hongcheng, he was killed.</p><p>A figure flickered and Xie Luan appeared, his demonic Qi soaring to the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
