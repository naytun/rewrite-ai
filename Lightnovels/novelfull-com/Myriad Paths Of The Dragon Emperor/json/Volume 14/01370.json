With his cultivation at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm, it was enough to dominate the divine wilderness.</p><p>But now, he realized that the divine wilderness continent was a Dragon’s pool and a Tiger’s Den. It was a hell.</p><p>“Spare me!”</p><p>The Holy sky Emperor begged for mercy.</p><p>I’ve said it before. Since you’ve come to take my primordial chaos token, you should be prepared to be killed. Do you really think that the divine wilderness continent is your back garden? do you think that I, Lu Ming, can be toyed with by you as you please? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He appeared behind the Holy sky Emperor and slashed his dragon vein sword mercilessly.</p><p>The Holy sky Emperor remorsefully tried to resist, but the result was difficult to change.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Holy sky Emperor was defeated and killed in the air.</p><p>The five sovereigns who had come to attack had all died!</p><p>“Lu Ming, send out the order to gather all the sovereigns to guard the Imperial Dragon City. I’m afraid that there will be more powerful people coming!”</p><p>Xie Luan suggested.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and said, ” if we defend passively, there will be no end to it. Now, we need to take the initiative and beat them until they are afraid. Spread the news to every corner of the divine wilderness continent. Do not put up any resistance against the experts from the other continents. Tell them directly that I, Lu Ming, am at Emperor Fall Mountain!</p><p>“You’re going to be in Emperor Fall Mountain …”</p><p>Xie Luan asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“That’s right, Emperor Fall Mountain, kill the emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Do you need our help?” Xie Luan said. He could not help but secretly admire Lu Ming’s decisiveness.</p><p>“No need. Thank you, senior, you’re in charge of Dragon Emperor City!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he took a step forward and headed for the fallen Emperor mountain.</p><p>Emperor-falling mountain was only 600000 miles away from Dragon Emperor City. It was a huge peak that reached into the sky.</p><p>It was said that in the distant past, an Emperor had fallen here, so it was called Emperor Fall Mountain.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming appeared at the peak of the fallen Emperor mountain. He sat cross-legged and waited quietly.</p><p>The Dragon Imperial City had also spread the news to every corner of the divine wilderness continent, saying that Lu Ming was at the Emperor Fall Mountain.</p><p>As time passed, more and more powerful cultivators from other continents arrived in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Lu Ming is at the fallen Emperor mountain!”</p><p>“Let’s go to Emperor Fall Mountain!”</p><p>I want to be one step ahead and get the primordial chaos token!</p><p>One figure after another headed towards Emperor Fall Mountain.</p><p>At the edge of Northern Plains, the sky rumbled, a huge ship crossing the sea appeared on the coastline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>three figures appeared in the ship, each of them exuding vast and powerful auras.</p><p>Two of the three figures were at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm. The one in the middle was even more terrifying, having reached the peak of the third level martial Royal realm.</p><p>This person had long green hair and looked to be in his forties.</p><p>In the distance, a beam of light flashed and a middle-aged man appeared in front of the three of them. He bowed to the green-haired middle-aged man in the middle and said, ” “Second master, I’ve found out that Lu Ming is in seclusion at the fallen Emperor mountain!”</p><p>“Oh? I got it!”</p><p>The blue-haired middle-aged man nodded and sneered. this Lu Ming is really audacious. He even dares to kill the young master of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion. This time, my big brother sent me here to kill Lu Ming first to avenge my two nephews and to take the mixed energy token!</p><p>“This subordinate will definitely do his best!”</p><p>The others on the side quickly said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man was the first to step forward.</p><p>……</p><p>In the fallen Emperor mountain, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, casually scanning his surroundings.</p><p>Seven or eight experts had already appeared around the fallen Emperor mountain.</p><p>They were all powerhouses from different continents, and each of them was a Lv 2 martial Royal realm powerhouse.</p><p>This power was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, these people did not make a move. It was not because they were worried about Lu Ming, but because they were worried about each other and were in a stalemate.</p><p>the mixed essence token is mine. I was the first to arrive!</p><p>“What a joke. You came first, so it’s yours? That’s bullshit!”</p><p>“Could it be that you all want to fight me to a draw against the continent?”</p><p>One voice after another rang out as the auras of the powerful sovereigns burst forth. They stood in the air and faced each other, not giving in.</p><p>Two more experts had arrived after the draw with the continent. One of them was at the third level martial Royal realm, while the other was at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>As expected of one of the top ten continents in the continent group of the divine Ruins, it was very powerful.</p><p>All the experts were in a confrontation. They were all wary of each other, and no one made a move.</p><p>A faint smile appeared at the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth. He did not try to break the balance.</p><p>Now was not the time to make a move. It would not be too late to make a move when there were more people.</p><p>As time passed, more and more emperors came.</p><p>Behind them, there were sixteen more.</p><p>Even the White Feather continent, which was ranked fourth in the continent group of the divine Ruins, had sent a few.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, four figures flew over from the distance.</p><p>The one in the lead was the green-haired middle-aged man.</p><p>I’m working in the sea-suppressing Marshal’s mansion of the South God Palace of the divine Ruins continent. All unrelated people, please leave!</p><p>A person beside the green-haired middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>The other people’s expressions changed.</p><p>“What? Even the people from the South God Palace are here!”</p><p>doesn’t the South God Palace have a primordial chaos token? why are they still involved? ”</p><p>The others spoke up one after another, their expressions grave.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was too powerful, far stronger than the other continents.</p><p>However, it was impossible for them to give up just like that.</p><p>“Sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, don’t try to oppress us with your power. We have so many people here, so we’re not afraid of you!”</p><p>that’s right. If it was the sea suppressing Commander-in-Chief, we might be a bit afraid. But you want us to retreat? impossible!</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>The people who had appeared here were all peak experts from the various continents. Although the green-haired middle-aged man had a strong cultivation, he was only at the peak of the LV 3 martial Royal realm. He could not scare these experts.</p><p>Humph, you really don’t know what’s good for you. Do you want to go against the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion and the South God Palace? ”</p><p>The Azure-haired middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with a cold light as he coldly rebuked.</p><p>But the others sneered, and none of them retreated.</p><p>Most of the experts from the southern continent of the divine Ruins had gathered here. With so many experts gathered, why would they be afraid of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion? At most, he could hide after getting the mixed essence token. What could the experts of the South God Palace do?</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man’s face darkened.</p><p>Everyone present was an expert. There were no less than five third level martial Royal realm experts. Although none of them were at the peak of the third level martial Royal realm, he was still afraid of the joint attack of so many experts.</p><p>“We’re finally almost there!”</p><p>At this moment, on the fallen Emperor mountain, Lu Ming spoke indifferently.</p><p>Many of the sovereigns looked at Lu Ming in unison.</p><p>Lu Ming, how dare you kill the people of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion! Hand over the mixed element token now and come with me to the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion to accept your punishment!</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>Hai Tian, Hai Yu, those two pieces of trash. It’s fine if you kill them. If you want revenge, then do it!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
