Li Ping’s tears were flowing uncontrollably.</p><p>When the experts of the gate of God came and announced Lu Ming’s death, Lu Yuntian and Li Ping naturally heard the news as well. It was as if they had been struck by lightning, and the two old men almost could not take it.</p><p>However, they had a feeling that Lu Ming was not dead. He should still be alive.</p><p>Indeed, they had heard the news that Lu Ming had returned and that his cultivation had reached an unbelievable level. He could stand shoulder to shoulder with the top experts of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The old couple was extremely confident and excited.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the two elders were fine. He chatted with them for a long time before he bade them farewell and left.</p><p>In a secret room, Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body sat opposite each other.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body waved his hand and various mystical materials flew out.</p><p>Fire spiritual root, Emperor’s Blood Stone, earth Emperor essence …</p><p>They were all spirit herbs and rare treasures for refining Nirvana pills.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to let his second body refine the Nirvana pill.</p><p>Lu Ming had already collected all the supplementary spiritual herbs for the Nirvana elixir. The most difficult ones to collect were the seven main spiritual materials. When he was in the continent of the divine Ruins, Lu Ming had already collected six of them. He was still short of the last one, the eight-pointed frozen grass.</p><p>However, he did not expect that during the fight for the pure spirit body, Lu Ming would kill the purple-and-golden-robed elder from the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence and find an eight-pointed frozen grass in his storage ring.</p><p>With that, he had gathered all the seven main spiritual ingredients and could start making the Nirvana elixir.</p><p>Ming Lian waved his hand and a pill furnace appeared. Then, all the materials for the Nirvana pill flew towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body moved and appeared at the side. He sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to cultivate.</p><p>As his fingers moved rapidly, countless inscriptions appeared and wrapped all the mystical materials. He began to refine the body.</p><p>The profound sky Saint was a being who had become a saint through the Dao of inscription. He had profound attainments in formations, refining weapons, and alchemy. Lu Ming had obtained the inheritance of the profound sky Saint and became an Emperor. Naturally, his alchemy skills were also profound.</p><p>The Golden flames of inscription appeared and wrapped around the various mystical materials, and the process began.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>In these three days, the entire divine wilderness continent was in an uproar because of the two pieces of news.</p><p>On the first day, Lu Ming, the unparalleled genius who was said to have died in the divine Ruins, returned.</p><p>The moment he returned, he participated in the battle of Tianxia Academy.</p><p>In this battle, Lu Ming had displayed shocking combat strength.</p><p>With his spiritual God Realm cultivation, he could easily kill an Emperor and fight with a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>This news was like a magnitude 10 earthquake, causing a huge wave.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, countless cultivators were dumbfounded. They could not believe it.</p><p>Then, another piece of news came out.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace would form an alliance with the ancient Saint dynasty’s Xie clan in the sacred city a month later. At that time, they would kill Supreme nine suns, Bai Shijin, and the others, and use their blood as a sacrifice to the flag.</p><p>Once this news spread, it also caused a Thousand Waves.</p><p>Some people who knew the inside story could even see that something was unusual.</p><p>The nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others had a close relationship with Lu Ming. Since the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie family had spread this news at this time, it was obviously related to Lu Ming.</p><p>Some people speculated that this move was most likely to lure Lu Ming to the holy city and then kill him.</p><p>This was an Open Conspiracy, not a conspiracy. Even if the whole world knew the motive of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family, Lu Ming still had to go if he had to, unless he didn’t care about the life and death of nine suns Supreme and the others.</p><p>it looks like the divine wilderness continent is about to change!</p><p>there’s going to be an earth-shattering battle in the holy city!</p><p>Someone sighed, paying attention to the situation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming received a voice transmission that someone was paying him a visit.</p><p>Lu Ming came out of the secret chamber to meet the people who had come to visit him.</p><p>They were Bai chixue, Huan Zhen, Ji mai, and the other paragons of the talisman sect.</p><p>“Your subordinate greets you, zongzi!”</p><p>As soon as they saw Lu Ming, Huan Zhen, Bai chixue, and the others, they bowed their heads and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Chi Xue, brother Huan, what are you doing? We’re all friends, there’s no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and an invisible force lifted Huan Zhen and the rest, making them unable to bow down.</p><p>The few of them had complicated feelings. They knew that Lu Ming’s current cultivation level had far surpassed theirs. The gap between them was huge.</p><p>Among them, Huan Zhen, who had the strongest cultivation, was only a level-seven Alchemist. He had yet to break through to level-eight.</p><p>Bai chixue had received the inheritance of a level nine Alchemist and had made great progress in the past few years. However, she was still not as good as Huan Zhen.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re here to beg you. You have to save master and the others!”</p><p>Bai chixue’s eyes were filled with tears, and her face looked miserable.</p><p>“Sigh, Lu Ming, we’re useless. We can’t save master and the rest. We can only rely on you now!”</p><p>Huan Zhen sighed.</p><p>Ever since the news that the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family had formed an alliance to kill Bai Shijin and the others spread, Huan Zhen, Bai chixue, and the others had panicked. At this critical moment, they could only think of Lu Ming. That was why they had come to find him together.</p><p>Although they knew that it would be dangerous to save Bai Shijin and the others, they had no choice.</p><p>“Chi Xue, brother Huan, don’t worry. Lu Ming is greatly indebted to all the seniors. He will definitely not let anything happen to them!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a determined look.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words seemed to be infectious. Bai chixue and the others ‘anxious hearts calmed down a little.</p><p>Soon, Bai chixue and the others left.</p><p>Before leaving, Bai chixue cast a glance at Lu Ming. Her heart was filled with complicated feelings.</p><p>She used to have some feelings for Lu Ming, but now, the distance between them was extremely far apart. They were people from two completely different worlds. She could only bury those feelings deep in her heart.</p><p>After Bai chixue and the rest left, Lu Ming received news that someone had come to visit him.</p><p>“Fatty, Tingting, senior mo Tian.”</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, fatty Kong Jin, ruan Tingting, and the devil-Sky King were the ones who came.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Ever since the war of Providence ended and fatty and ruan Tingting left with the devil Sky Emperor to cultivate, there had been no news from them for many years. Lu Ming did not expect that fatty and the rest would come here to look for him.</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, long time no see. I really missed you!</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, the fatty laughed and gave Lu Ming a bear hug.</p><p>“Fatty, your figure is even more well-developed!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Fatty’s figure was indeed fatter than before.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Fatty laughed awkwardly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re amazing now. You can even kill an Emperor. The gap between us is getting bigger and bigger!”</p><p>Fatty quickly changed the topic.</p><p>“You’re not bad either!”</p><p>Lu Ming punched the fatty.</p><p>After not seeing each other for a few years, fatty had also made great progress. He had already reached the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. His progress could be said to be divine.</p><p>One had to know that fatty had only awakened an eighth level divine rank bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming then greeted ruan Tingting and the devil Sky King.</p><p>“Oh right, fatty, where have you been all these years?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
