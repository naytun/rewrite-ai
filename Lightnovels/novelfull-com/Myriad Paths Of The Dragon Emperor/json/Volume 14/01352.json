He ruled the world and was invincible. With a wave of his hand, the sky would collapse and the earth would crack. With a thought, he could kill hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>...</p><p>They had never seen such a figure in their entire lives. However, more than 20 of such figures had died in a single battle. They simply couldn’t imagine it.</p><p>Lu Ming is the one who is leading all of this!</p><p>Mu Tian suddenly let out another sigh.</p><p>Mu Yi and mu Zheng fell silent.</p><p>“Big brother, the Lu Ming You mentioned, is he the Lu Ming that walked out of our place?”</p><p>Mu Yi muttered to himself for a moment before asking. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>It was said that the one who dominated that battle was a young genius named Lu Ming. He had killed more than Ten Sovereigns and was terrifyingly powerful. That young man was called Lu Ming.</p><p>Furthermore, after the war, almost all the emperors and powerful factions in the divine wilderness continent formed an alliance called the Dragon Alliance. The leader of the Dragon Alliance was also Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m not sure. We’re at the border and the information I received is not very detailed. I only know that Lu Ming was born in the East continent!</p><p>Mu Tian said, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>“From the East continent? Could it be the same person?”</p><p>Mu Yi and mu Zheng let out a long breath.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a violent rumble was heard outside Tianxuan city.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Mu Tian stood up abruptly and his voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared and quickly reported, ” “Palace Master, things are bad. The palace Master of the Emperor heaven divine Palace branch in the black knife region has led people to attack!”</p><p>“What? The black knife region!”</p><p>Mu Tian’s expression changed.</p><p>“Damn it, the black knife region is taking advantage of a burning house!”</p><p>Mu Zheng shouted angrily.</p><p>When the news of the Emperor heaven divine Palace being exterminated spread, all the branch palaces were in complete chaos. Some of the branch palaces directly seized the treasures belonging to the Emperor heaven divine Palace, and even seized the treasures of the other branch palaces.</p><p>For example, the palace Masters of the black knife region’s sub-palaces were like this, leading people to plunder everywhere.</p><p>In any case, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had already been destroyed, and no one cared about it. These people wanted to plunder a batch of treasures before escaping far away and hiding to cultivate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another rushed into Tianxuan city, and powerful auras filled the air.</p><p>“Men, welcome the enemy!”</p><p>Mu Tian shouted and soared into the sky.</p><p>Mu Yi and mu Zheng followed closely behind. At the same time, figures flew out from various parts of Tianxuan city and gathered with mu Tian and the others.</p><p>As soon as they gathered, a group of people flew over. They were all wearing black robes and carrying black sabers on their backs.</p><p>The person in the lead had a fierce-looking face, a beard, and a burly body.</p><p>“Dao Heng, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Mu Tian shouted angrily.</p><p>“Haha, what do you want? It’s very simple. Hand over all the spiritual herbs, materials, and treasures of the profound sky sub-Palace, and I’ll spare your lives!”</p><p>The big man, also known as Dao Heng, laughed.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. Dao Heng, how dare you. Although the Emperor heaven divine Palace has been destroyed, the Dragon Alliance has been established and is ruling the world. They will definitely come to take over the original power of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. If you do this, you will be hunted down by the Dragon Alliance!”</p><p>Mu Tian shouted.</p><p>haha, what a joke. The Dragon Alliance is such a huge organization. How could they notice our desolate land so quickly? even if they did, we’re just a small fight in their eyes. They won’t pursue the matter. Cut the crap and hand over the treasure!</p><p>Dao Heng said maliciously.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Mu Tian’s attitude was unyielding.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, kill!”</p><p>kill! Dao Heng shouted and took the lead in charging towards mu Tian. The people he brought with him also charged towards mu Yi and the rest.</p><p>The aura of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm bloomed from mu Tian’s body. After all these years of cultivation, mu Tian’s cultivation had improved a little, reaching the third level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>Mu Yi and mu Zheng had also broken through their limits and entered the spirit sea realm. They were at the first level of the spirit sea realm.</p><p>In addition, Tianxuan sub-Palace still had two martial artists at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm. However, the black knife region had even more experts, with a total of eight martial artists at the spiritual ocean realm. Dao Heng’s cultivation was also at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>For a time, the Tianxuan region was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The battle between the two sides was very intense. People were constantly killed, and their corpses fell to the ground in Tianxuan city.</p><p>However, although the black knife region had the advantage, this was Tianxuan city after all. The Tianxuan region had the home ground advantage and could still fight with the black knife region by using various formations.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Mu Tian and Dao Heng kept clashing with each other. After dozens of moves, neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>mu Tian, I didn’t expect that you actually broke through to the third level of the spiritual ocean realm without a sound!</p><p>Dao Heng’s anxious voice was heard.</p><p>In the past, the black knife region’s strength was stronger than the Tianxuan region’s, especially Dao Heng, who had a cultivation at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. He was considered strong even among the palace Masters of the nearby large regions.</p><p>He didn’t expect that mu Tian’s cultivation had also reached the third level of the spiritual ocean tier without a sound and could contend with him.</p><p>The battle situation had suddenly turned into a state of anxiety.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, went to the hundred deities slope.</p><p>The hundred deities slope was filled with grey mist, just like it was in the past.</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual senses, Lu Ming discovered that there were still people guarding outside the hundred deities slope. However, they were only at the king’s level and were miles away from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed into the hundred deities slope. The guards did not notice him at all.</p><p>As soon as he flew into the gray fog-filled area, Lu Ming felt a force acting on his body, preventing him from flying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was much stronger than it had been in the past. By circulating his essential core, Lu Ming was able to offset this force and continued to fly in.</p><p>The deeper he went, the stronger the power became. It was suppressing Lu Ming and trying to suppress his cultivation completely.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming came in, his cultivation level was completely suppressed and he became an ordinary person.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that the suppressive force from the outside world was not to be underestimated. It was very shocking.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s cultivation level, he had a feeling that he was about to be suppressed.</p><p>Furthermore, the deeper he went, the stronger the feeling of suppression became.</p><p>the intent realm floating here is also not simple!</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings with his spiritual senses.</p><p>Initially, when he entered, he was lucky and encountered many different types of intent. He used them to comprehend and increase the level of his intent. Those were all left behind by experts after they died.</p><p>However, from Lu Ming’s point of view, he saw something different. The artistic conception that floated between heaven and earth was indeed left behind by an expert after his death. However, Lu Ming could feel a terrifying pressure from it.</p><p>Legend had it that the hundred deities slope was formed when the sky split open countless years ago and corpses fell down.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that those corpses were definitely above the level of an Emperor. They were most likely the corpses of Saints.</p><p>Therefore, even though so many years had passed, he had to suppress his cultivation base when he entered with his current realm.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and the chaos concept surrounded his body.</p><p>As soon as the chaos concept was released, Lu Ming felt his body lighten. The pressure disappeared without a trace.</p><p>the chaos intent is so mysterious!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
