His figure flashed and he turned into a rainbow light, traversing the hundred deities slope.</p><p>...</p><p>The reason why he came to the hundred deities slope was because he had obtained the lightning cauldron here. In addition, he had also seen a round bead here.</p><p>There might be good stuff in the hundred deities slope. That was why Lu Ming came to explore.</p><p>However, after a round, Lu Ming was disappointed. Other than the floating concept, Lu Ming did not find anything, let alone any treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little disappointed. After all, the hundred deities slope had been around for too many years. Furthermore, some treasures, such as holy weapons, were sentient and would fly away by themselves.</p><p>There might have been some treasures in the hundred deities slope in the distant past, but it had been too long. Some of them might have lost their spirituality and turned into yellow soil, while others might have flown away by themselves.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming was really lucky to have obtained the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a strong wind blowing in front of him. In the strong wind, there was a round bead floating up and down. Outside the round bead, there was a small green bird flying.</p><p>“It’s that bead!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He did not expect to encounter the round bead again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he pounced toward the round bead.</p><p>The bird on the bead seemed to be frightened. With a cry, it flew into the bead, and the bead flew away with a green light.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and moved like lightning, closing the distance between him and the bead in an instant.</p><p>The bead was shocked again. It shook and with a whoosh, its speed increased greatly, pulling away from Lu Ming.</p><p>“How can it be so fast?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, then overjoyed.</p><p>This bead was not ordinary. Even if it was not as amazing as the lightning cauldron, it was at least better than an Emperor spiritual weapon. Since Lu Ming had seen it, how could he return empty-handed?</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed and chased after the round bead at top speed.</p><p>Like two bolts of lightning, one chased and the other escaped. In a short while, they had circled the hundred deities slope several times.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and stretched out his hand.</p><p>A huge claw that was ten miles wide and wrapped in chaos intent took shape and grabbed at the Pearl.</p><p>The large hand immediately enveloped the bead.</p><p>The bead buzzed and charged in one direction. However, when the bead came into contact with the chaos will, it suddenly stopped. It did not continue to escape. Instead, it approached the chaos will and trembled slightly.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the round bead was clearly enjoying it.</p><p>Lu Ming sucked and grabbed the bead with his claws.</p><p>Then, he wrapped the bead with the chaos concept. As expected, the chaos concept resonated with the bead and a message appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Air-frozen bead!</p><p>The bead was called air-frozen bead, a wind-attribute treasure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The air-frozen bead shook and flew into Lu Ming’s glabella. It stopped not far from the Thunder cauldron in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>With a single thought, a green energy surged into Lu Ming’s body from the air-frozen bead. Lu Ming cast the wind element art and disappeared from his original spot with a single step, reappearing thousands of miles away.</p><p>what a fast speed! The wind power in this bead can greatly increase my speed when I use the wind elemental technique!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>An increase in speed meant that his ability to survive would be stronger.</p><p>the air-frozen bead is more powerful than an Emperor spiritual weapon. There must be other mysteries to it. I’ll study it slowly in the future. I’ll go to Tianxuan city first!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He then left the hundred deities slope and headed towards Tianxuan city.</p><p>……</p><p>The Tianxuan city’s Grand array was extremely intense, and there were constant casualties.</p><p>Even mu Tian, mu Yi, and mu Zheng were injured. The Tianxuan city had suffered a great loss.</p><p>However, the black knife region’s losses were not small either.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Dao Heng roared in his heart. He didn’t expect that Tianxuan city would be so difficult to deal with.</p><p>what a piece of trash! You can’t even take down Tianxuan city after such a long time!</p><p>At this moment, a cold shout came from the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a powerful aura descended from the sky, causing mu Tian and the others to turn pale.</p><p>“Seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm!”</p><p>Mu Tian exclaimed and looked up.</p><p>In the air, a figure wrapped in a black robe appeared. The shocking aura was coming from his body.</p><p>“My Lord, you’ve come!”</p><p>Seeing this person, Dao Heng was overjoyed.</p><p>The hearts of mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the others sank.</p><p>Dao Heng addressed the other party as “Sir.” It was obvious that the other party was in Dao Heng’s group. Who was it that even Dao Heng addressed him as “Sir”?</p><p>Could it be that a higher-up of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was taking the opportunity to plunder treasures?</p><p>All sorts of thoughts flashed through mu Tian and mu Zheng’s minds.</p><p>leave this person to me. You deal with the others and end the battle quickly!</p><p>The black-robed man’s voice rang out. A thin and long black sword appeared in his hand, and he thrust it at mu Tian.</p><p>The speed of this sword was shocking.</p><p>Mu Tian’s expression changed drastically as he quickly retreated.</p><p>However, his body was not as fast as the sword light.</p><p>The other party was at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier. His strength was much stronger than his.</p><p>“Don’t hurt my father!”</p><p>At this moment, a delicate shout came from Tianxuan city. A fiery red sword light flew out and collided with the sword light of the black-robed man.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The black-robed man’s sword light was blocked, and the fiery red sword light was also sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure rushed out from below and stood in front of mu Tian.</p><p>“LAN ‘er!”</p><p>Mu Tian called out.</p><p>Mu Lan. The figure that appeared behind her was Mu Lan.</p><p>Mu Lan stood in the air, a powerful aura exuding from her body. She was also at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>“Father, why didn’t you call me?”</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, you were in closed-door cultivation, so I didn’t call you!”</p><p>Mu Tian said.</p><p>hehe, I didn’t expect that there would be such a beautiful girl here. What luck!</p><p>The black-robed man’s eyes were scanning Mu Lan’s body with a fiery gaze.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Mu Lan shouted coldly. With the Battle Sword in hand, he charged towards the black-robed man.</p><p>The two of them began to fight.</p><p>For a moment, Mu Lan had the upper hand.</p><p>After exchanging more than ten moves, the black-robed man was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>Although their cultivation bases were similar, Mu Lan’s combat strength was obviously above his. The more they fought, the more frightened the black-robed man became.</p><p>sixth brother, you’ve seen enough. Why aren’t you attacking? let’s end this battle quickly. If we delay, there will be changes!</p><p>The black-robed man suddenly shouted towards the sky.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>A second black-robed man appeared behind a cloud in the sky.</p><p>This black-robed man’s aura was even more shocking, reaching the eighth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Mu Tian and the others were shocked.</p><p>The other party actually had so many experts.</p><p>“This little Girl Is Mine!”</p><p>The black-robed man who appeared from behind looked at Mu Lan with a fiery gaze and spoke coldly.</p><p>“Alright, it’s yours then!”</p><p>The black-robed man in front gritted his teeth.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The second black-robed man turned into a black light and charged toward Mu Lan.</p><p>With the two black-robed men working together, in addition to the second black-robed man’s cultivation at the eighth level of the spiritual ocean tier, the pressure on Mu Lan increased greatly, and she was at a disadvantage for a moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
