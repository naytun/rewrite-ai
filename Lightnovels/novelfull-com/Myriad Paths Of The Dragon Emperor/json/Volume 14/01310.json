Also, why do they all say that I died in the divine Ruins continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, full of questions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s a long story. Let’s go back to the hundred beasts tribe first and I’ll tell you in detail!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the group headed towards the inner area of the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>After arriving at the hundred beasts tribe, Lu Ming felt that the atmosphere was even more off.</p><p>Inside and outside the hundred beasts tribe, there were all kinds of formations. Every corner was guarded by powerful warriors and many armored soldiers. The atmosphere was very heavy, as if a great battle was about to start.</p><p>When Lu Ming left the divine wilderness continent, although the divine wilderness continent was also in the midst of a war and the Northern Plains had just experienced a war, the atmosphere then was not as heavy as it was now.</p><p>Now, it seemed like a life-and-death battle was about to happen at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious but he could only suppress his doubts and ask later.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s return quickly spread throughout the hundred beasts tribe, causing a huge commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group arrived at a meeting hall in the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>In the meeting hall, everyone was seated on both sides. There were two seats at the head of the table, and Xie Luan was seated in one.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please!”</p><p>Xie Luan raised his hand and motioned for Lu Ming to take a seat.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and sat down beside Xie Lun. He did not notice the displeasure in the eyes of qu Luo, Mo Ye, and the other sovereigns.</p><p>After everyone sat down, more and more people came in. They were all high-ranking officials, and even the weakest was a Supreme-being expert. In a moment, there were dozens of people sitting in the hall.</p><p>Senior Xie, why did those armored soldiers say that I died on the continent of the divine Ruins the moment I came back? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but ask.</p><p>Lu Ming, not long ago, the sea-crossing ship that took you to the continent of the divine Ruins returned. The experts of the gate of God of the continent of the divine Ruins said that you, Lu Ming, offended the Paragon of the yuan continent’s big sect, the deity sect. You angered the deity sect, and they killed you!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The experts of the gate of God were obviously the ones who had sent Long Chen, Ming Zi, and the others back from the South God Palace. But why did the people of the South God Palace say so? They said that he had been killed.</p><p>Could it be that the people from the South God Palace were experts from the MU family?</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>When Long Chen, Ming Zi, and monk Wuliang set off to return to the divine wilderness continent, it should be the time when Lu Ming and the rest were being pursued by the MU family’s head and the rest. This was why the people from the South deity Palace believed that Lu Ming was dead for sure. They only said that Lu Ming had been killed when they arrived at the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess in his heart!</p><p>“Then what about Long Chen, Dark Child, and the Western Desert’s Saint monk? No one came out to speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, and only three people came back. They’re Dark Child and the two Holy monks of the Western Desert. Long Chen is nowhere to be found. After dark Child and the other two came back, they released the news that they were in seclusion and didn’t say a word to the outside world!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Long Chen didn’t come back?”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Could it be that Long Chen had also been assassinated like them?</p><p>Moreover, looking at the situation, Ming Zi and the rest should have been warned by the South God Palace and did not say a word. In this case, the matter of Lu Ming being recruited as a disciple by another big sect in the yuan continent, Dragon God Valley, was naturally not revealed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you really offend a heaven’s favorite of the yuan continent’s big sect, the tianshen sect?”</p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the voice and looked over. It was quluo, who was staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows slightly. In the past, quluo had always addressed him as general Lu. But now, he was calling Lu Ming by his full name, and his tone was questioning.</p><p>The others ‘gazes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Given his intelligence, he naturally knew what was going on.</p><p>In the past, they had taken a fancy to Lu Ming’s talent and thought that he could join a major sect in the yuanlu continent and lead them in the future. However, the people from the South God Palace came and said that Lu Ming had offended a genius of a major sect in the yuanlu continent and had been killed by him.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was still alive, he had offended a genius of a major sect in the yuanlu continent. Naturally, he could not join a major sect.</p><p>They could not join the major sects of the yuanlu continent and had even offended the geniuses of the major sects. Naturally, their attitude towards Lu Ming changed.</p><p>“That’s right, I have offended the heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered honestly.</p><p>Lu Ming, I don’t want to criticize you, but even though you have some talent, you still need to know your place and know your limits. Your talent is not bad in the divine wilderness continent, but in the yuan continent, it’s nothing. How dare you offend the yuan continent’s elites? it’s fine if you offend them, but don’t drag us down with you!</p><p>Quluo said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming, I want to know if the major sects in the yuanlu continent know that you’ve returned this time.</p><p>Mo Ye also spoke.</p><p>“Quluo, Mo Ye, that’s enough. Lu Ming is my ally!”</p><p>On the side, Xie Luan frowned and scolded.</p><p>“Ancestor devil, but …”</p><p>Qu Luo wanted to say more.</p><p>“I said enough!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Qu Luo shut his mouth and did not dare to say another word. However, he looked at Lu Ming with a faint disdain.</p><p>Since Lu Ming could not join a major sect in the yuanlu continent, he was just a junior. He was only a spiritual God Realm martial artist and he looked down on him from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and did not bother to explain. He had defeated the heaven’s pride expert of the tianshen sect and won first place in the test. He had also joined another major sect of the yuanlu continent, the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Senior Xie, what is the situation in the divine wilderness continent? Why do I feel that the hundred beasts tribe is heavily guarded, and that all the seniors are gathered at the hundred beasts tribe?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the other question in his heart.</p><p>In the past, the experts had been guarding different places in Northern Plains, but now, they seemed to be gathered in the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming, the situation in the divine wilderness continent has changed greatly!</p><p>Xie Luan frowned at the mention of this.</p><p>“The situation has changed? What’s the reason?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Because of Di Yi!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Di Yi?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Di Yi had such a great ability to change the situation of the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>yes, it’s because of Di Yi. When you left, the Heavenly King token was also taken away by the experts of the gate of God. However, the enmity between the ancient Saint dynasty and the heaven suppressing divine Army has run deep. It’s difficult to stop the battle! the elder said.</p><p>the other Overlord forces are also at war. The central continent is still in chaos, but the situation is still good. But a few months ago, Di Yi suddenly launched an attack …</p><p>Xie Luan explained in detail the major events that had happened during this period, especially those related to Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>It turned out that for so many years, everyone had been deceived by Martial Emperor Di Yi. Not only was he powerful, but he had also secretly developed his forces.</p><p>No one knew when Nan Ming had been subdued by Martial Emperor Di Yi and joined him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
