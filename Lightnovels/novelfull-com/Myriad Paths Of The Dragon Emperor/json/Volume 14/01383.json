Now, he was even more amazing, killing martial sovereigns as if he was chopping vegetables.</p><p>This was too inconceivable. Everyone attributed all of this to the divine Ruins ‘core.</p><p>It was definitely so. Lu Ming must have obtained a treasure in the core of the divine Ruins to have such results.</p><p>“Mixed essence token!”</p><p>Everyone was staring at Lu Ming, wishing they could eat him up.</p><p>However, no one made a move for the time being. There were so many people here, and the four divine palaces had gathered. Everyone wanted the mixed-essence token, so they were all apprehensive about each other.</p><p>“Who should I give the mixed essence token to? How about this, I surrender and join one of your sides, helping you all enter the divine Ruins ‘core!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile as he spoke.</p><p>The eyes of the people from the four great divine palaces lit up.</p><p>However, everyone immediately became wary of each other. If Lu Ming really joined one of them, he would definitely be attacked by the other three.</p><p>“Don’t fall for this brat’s ploy to sow discord. He’s trying to incite us to make the first move!”</p><p>A loud shout rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and realized that the one who spoke was the sea suppressing Marshal of the southern deity Palace, hai pengtian.</p><p>Hai pengtian looked at Lu Ming with a face full of hatred.</p><p>“That’s right, he wants us to fight so he can find a chance to escape!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>These people were old monsters who had lived for thousands of years or even tens of thousands of years. They were very sharp and could read Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>I suggest that we take down Lu Ming first and cripple his cultivation. Then, the four great divine palaces will jointly manage it. Anyway, there are Divine Ruins near the four great divine palaces. We can take turns to use Lu Ming and enter the divine Ruins to explore. Won’t that do? ”</p><p>Wang Sheng opened his mouth and gave a suggestion.</p><p>“I think we can!”</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>The others also spoke up and reached an agreement.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, your little scheme is useless in front of us. You’d better surrender obediently. This is your fate!”</p><p>Hai pengtian sneered.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression remained calm as his plan to sow discord had failed. He glanced at hai pengtian and said,”Then make your move, come and take me!”</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s confident look, hai pengtian almost made a move. However, he held back at the crucial moment.</p><p>this kid is full of tricks. Since he’s so calm, maybe there’s a trap here. He has a clone who’s good at the Dao of inscription. Maybe he’s set up a killing formation here!</p><p>Hai pengtian analyzed after calming down.</p><p>“That’s right, we must guard against this!”</p><p>The other Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert said.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t dare to make a move? What a useless piece of trash, as timid as a mouse!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>This caused hai pengtian and the other overlords of the four divine palaces to have ugly expressions.</p><p>They were really afraid of the ultimate killing formation that Lu Ming had set up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was so strong that he could kill a third level Martial Emperor.</p><p>This was very strange in the first place. What they were afraid of was that Lu Ming might have obtained some treasure from the core of the divine Ruins and set it up in the large array. Whoever made the first move would most likely be in danger.</p><p>However, they could not attack together and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>The primordial chaos token had already fused with Lu Ming. Even if they killed Lu Ming, they would not be able to obtain the primordial chaos token.</p><p>The only way was to take down Lu Ming or cripple his cultivation.</p><p>This way, they would have some scruples when they made a move.</p><p>“Still not attacking? What Overlord? they’re all trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely arrogant. He was not worried at all.</p><p>This made everyone even more certain that Lu Ming had cast a big array at this moment.</p><p>“We’ll know if there’s a formation after we send someone to try!”</p><p>An Overlord-level character spoke.</p><p>In the divine Ruins continent, only a fourth level Martial Emperor could be called an Overlord.</p><p>“That’s right, send someone to try!”</p><p>Another hegemon-level figure spoke out.</p><p>But who should they send?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes flickered, and no one was willing to step forward and try!</p><p>If Lu Ming had really set up a fatal formation there, the people who went up to test him would most likely be in danger.</p><p>This made the four great divine palaces unwilling to send people up first.</p><p>“Since these people from the small continent have followed us here, they should at least contribute a little …”</p><p>Someone said slowly.</p><p>The powerhouses from the other continents were shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In a flash, the overlords of the four divine palaces appeared beside the cultivators from the other continents. Their cold eyes sent chills down the spines of the cultivators from the other continents.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>Someone from the other continents shouted.</p><p>“What are you doing? If you want to fish in troubled waters here, you have to put in some effort. Go up and take down that kid!”</p><p>A hegemon-level character coldly spoke.</p><p>“You guys are too overbearing!”</p><p>Some people were unwilling.</p><p>nonsense. Go up. If you don’t, I’ll destroy you all now, including your continent!</p><p>The hegemon-level character berated, incomparably tyrannical.</p><p>In the end, other than the second-ranked Blood Sun continent, all the experts from the other continents had no choice but to step forward.</p><p>There were dozens of them.</p><p>They were both at the second or third level martial Royal realm.</p><p>These people were forced to slowly approach Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, surrender!”</p><p>A Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm expert berated.</p><p>nonsense. If you want to do it, do it quickly. Don’t waste time.</p><p>Lu Ming retorted.</p><p>“You … We’ll attack together!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s attack together!”</p><p>In the end, dozens of second and third level martial emperors charged at Lu Ming together.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming suddenly shouted. A Dragon’s Roar resounded in his body, and his third bloodline appeared. The Dragon vein sword appeared in his hand. He took a step forward and slashed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sword light destroyed the attacks and killed the three peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his leg out and a third level martial Royal realm expert was sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his combat sword and killed as if he had entered a no-man’s land.</p><p>The second level martial Royal realm experts were unable to block the Dragon vein sword’s attack. They were all killed in one strike. Only those at the third level could block a few attacks.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>All of a sudden, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged and Lu Ming transformed into the nine Dragons. The chaos Domain covered him and the Dragon claws of the nine Dragons kept slashing out, tearing a third level martial Royal realm expert apart.</p><p>The others gasped and retreated in fear.</p><p>Dozens of people attacked. In a few breaths, Lu Ming had killed more than ten people. They were of no threat to Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“This kid’s combat strength has increased again!”</p><p>Hai pengtian thought to himself.</p><p>Among the overlords here, he was the only one who had fought with Lu Ming before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
