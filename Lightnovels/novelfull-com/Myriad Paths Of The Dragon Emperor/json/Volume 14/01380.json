They deliberately let Wang Sheng and the others in, and they were caught red-handed outside.</p><p>...</p><p>Wang Sheng faced the sky and laughed loudly, his gaze sweeping across the entire place, saying: “What do you mean? Long Chen was captured by the Wang family, and he’s also an expert of the Wang family. After searching Long Chen’s soul, we found out the use of the token. It was you guys who joined forces to force me to hand over Long Chen and share the token with him. Now, I’m just taking back what I deserve!”</p><p>“Ridiculous, Wang Sheng, if we didn’t jointly control it, do you think that your Wang clan alone could protect the mixed energy token? It would have been taken away by the other three divine palaces!”</p><p>One of the patriarchs shouted coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’d rather the mixed energy token fall into the hands of the other three divine palaces than share it with you. So what if you cowards get the mixed energy token? They can only seal it up, but they don’t dare to take it out to use. What’s the use of such a primordial chaos token to enter the divine Ruins and obtain treasures?”</p><p>Wang Sheng sneered.</p><p>“Nonsense, it’s just not the right time. Wang Sheng, hand over Long Chen. Otherwise, the Wang family will be eliminated from the top ten families today!”</p><p>A white-haired old man shouted coldly. The aura on his body was extremely shocking as it pressed towards Wang Sheng.</p><p>He was a peak Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm expert.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, the experts of the other clans also burst out with powerful auras. The auras combined, and like a storm, they rushed towards Wang Sheng and the others.</p><p>The dozen or so people of the Wang family were like a lonely boat in the ocean, ready to sink at any moment.</p><p>The commotion here had naturally alarmed the surroundings. The inscription Masters who were guarding the periphery retreated far away and watched everything in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming was mixed in the crowd, waiting for an opportunity to make a move.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the northern sky.</p><p>There, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure. This pressure was approaching him rapidly.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>In the next moment, the space cracked open. Hundreds of figures stepped out from the crack. Each figure stood proudly in the sky and earth. Each one of them was a terrifying expert.</p><p>Emperors, all of them were emperors.</p><p>All of a sudden, over a hundred emperors came!</p><p>As soon as these sovereigns appeared, their auras burst out and pressed down on the cultivators of the South God Palace. Between heaven and earth, auras intersected, and a muffled Thunder-like sound rang out.</p><p>“North God Palace!”</p><p>“Wang Sheng, you are colluding with the North deity Palace!”</p><p>Suddenly, several angry roars burst out in the South God Palace.</p><p>The experts who arrived later were the experts of the North divine Palace.</p><p>haha, what do you mean by colluding? this is cooperation!</p><p>Wang Sheng laughed and brought Long Chen to break out of the encirclement and join the people of the North God Palace.</p><p>don’t even think about it! Leave Long Chen behind!</p><p>“The Wang clan must be exterminated!”</p><p>The experts of the South God Palace were all furious. They attacked together, and a terrifying attack was blasted towards Wang Sheng.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The experts from the North God Palace didn’t waste any words. At this moment, they also made their move and attacked the experts from the South God Palace.</p><p>On the side of the South God Palace, they could only send out their experts to block the North God Palace.</p><p>At this moment, hundreds of powerhouses were in a chaotic battle.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A wisp of energy hit the mountain below, causing it to explode and turn into ashes.</p><p>“Not good, run, quickly run!”</p><p>The inscription Masters and the martial artists below the Emperor realm were all running for their lives.</p><p>The scene of hundreds of emperors fighting together was too terrifying.</p><p>Bright lights lit up all over the South God Palace. They were inscriptions that formed into inscription formations.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At the same time, people from all over the South God Palace were also rushing toward the battlefield. They were all Emperor-level experts.</p><p>After all, this was the territory of the South God Palace. There were many experts who were constantly rushing over to gather.</p><p>Slowly, the South God Palace gained the upper hand.</p><p>Although the North divine Palace was the strongest of the four great divine palaces, it was impossible for the North divine Palace to come in full force. Facing the frenzied counterattacks of the South divine Palace, they began to fall into a disadvantage.</p><p>In the sky, there was a bloody rain and a foul wind. Corpses kept falling down. They were all the corpses of emperors.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying fluctuation spread out. It was a battle between Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Wang Sheng, hand over Long Chen!”</p><p>A clan head was staring at Wang Sheng and fighting with him.</p><p>“Ji Feng, you think you can stop me? get lost!”</p><p>Wang Sheng erupted, and his entire body was covered in Saint light. A sword of Saint light forced Ji Feng back, and he brought Long Chen with him as he continued to attack. He wanted to meet up with the people from the North deity Palace, but Ji Feng and his men blocked Wang Sheng’s path.</p><p>The other patriarchs of the South divine Palace led their men and fought against the experts of the North divine Palace.</p><p>you guys take long Chen and rush out of the South God Palace. I’ll hold them off!</p><p>Wang Sheng ordered his subordinates. At the same time, holy light spread out from his body. It was extremely dazzling, turning into countless swords of holy light. In an instant, they enveloped Ji Feng and the other experts.</p><p>He wanted to stall his opponent by himself and let his men break out with Long Chen.</p><p>Among the ten great clan leaders of the South God Palace, Wang Sheng’s battle strength was enough to rank in the top three.</p><p>Ji Feng roared and exploded with all his strength. However, for the time being, he was unable to break through Wang Sheng’s obstruction.</p><p>Wang Sheng’s subordinates were about to rush out with Long Chen.</p><p>No one noticed that Long Chen’s eyes were getting redder and redder, revealing a ferocious look.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Long Chen let out an angry roar. It didn’t sound like a human’s roar, but more like an ancient beast awakening.</p><p>An Archean dragonesque elephant the size of a mountain appeared above Long Chen’s head, bursting with a terrifying aura.</p><p>All of a sudden, Long Chen broke free from the man’s grasp and transformed into an immemorial Dragon elephant.</p><p>“How did he recover his cultivation?!”</p><p>An Emperor of the Wang family exclaimed.</p><p>Long Chen’s cultivation had been sealed, but how did it recover now?</p><p>While they were stunned, the Archean dragonesque elephant roared and stomped on a Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert with its leg, which was like a heavenly pillar.</p><p>The Emperor was caught off guard and let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was torn apart by the stomp. His body and soul were both destroyed.</p><p>He had killed a first level Martial Emperor in one move.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Dragon Star seemed to be undergoing some kind of mutation.</p><p>Lu Ming could see clearly that Long Chen’s cultivation should be at the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm. Although he had made great progress since the initial screening, it was impossible for Long Chen to kill a first level Martial Emperor with one move given his combat strength.</p><p>The reason might be that Dragon city’s immemorial Dragon elephant bloodline was in an abnormal state, and its combat power had been greatly improved.</p><p>After killing a first level martial Royal realm expert with a single move, the Archean dragonesque elephant charged forward and knocked back the other two martial Royal realm experts. It then fled into the distance.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>A third-level martial Royal realm expert from the Wang family attacked the Archean dragonesque elephant with a cold expression.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant was forced back, and its body exploded.</p><p>Hmph, you still dare to resist? then I’ll cripple your cultivation. As long as you don’t die, you can still use the primordial chaos token!</p><p>The LV 3 martial Royal realm expert from the Wang family had a cold expression as he charged toward Long Chen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
