This is not Yuan continent!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed.</p><p>On the side, the Dragon Guard also smiled. Lu Ming’s reaction was within their expectations.</p><p>“What? This isn’t the yuan continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank and he was shocked.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan waved his hand and the painting in the air disappeared, ” this is just a small island near the yuan continent. In your eyes, this is a continent. If we are really in the yuan continent, the pressure from the outside world will be stronger than this. Everything in the world will be more stable than this!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This place was not the yuan continent, but an Island near the yuan continent.</p><p>He was just close to the yuan continent, but everything in the world was so stable. The pressure from the outside world was so strong. How terrifying would the true Yuan continent be?</p><p>However, Lu Ming immediately thought of something.</p><p>The cultivation environment here was already dozens of times better than the continent of the divine Ruins. How good would the cultivation environment of the yuan continent be?</p><p>The pressure from the outside world was nothing. He would get used to it after some time. The cultivation environment was the most important thing. It could allow him to break through continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with even more anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is a transit point for outsiders to get used to it. Otherwise, I’m afraid you won’t be able to handle it if you enter the yuan continent at once!</p><p>Longyuan Shan explained with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded to express his understanding.</p><p>let’s go. There should be other people here. We’ll be staying here for half a month!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said before walking forward.</p><p>After crossing a huge mountain, he saw some attics in front of him. Lu Ming noticed that there were also some young people living there.</p><p>The cultivation of these youths was very strong. There were those at the eighth, ninth, and even the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the most powerful ones at the Supreme level.</p><p>He learned from Longyuan mountain that these young men were disciples recruited from various ‘continents’ by Dragon God Valley. Like Lu Ming, they had stayed in their original continents because of some matters and had only gone to Dragon God Valley now. Therefore, there were not many of them, only about a hundred.</p><p>Lu Ming was assigned to a room.</p><p>The next half a month was mainly to adapt to the environment here.</p><p>That was because the environment of the continent cluster of the divine Ruins and the yuan continent were too different.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>In the pavilion’s courtyard, Lu Ming performed a set of fist techniques and his body was flying around.</p><p>He allowed his body to slowly adapt to the environment here. At the same time, he also allowed the speed and frequency of the true essence in his meridians to adapt to this place.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming stopped. He felt very comfortable.</p><p>His body had also adapted to it slightly.</p><p>In the beginning, when Lu Ming took action, he would either use more or less force.</p><p>Now, he was much better.</p><p>“The origin Qi here is really dense. Also, the intent realm of the heaven and earth is really clear …”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully.</p><p>Here, the intent realm of heaven and earth was dozens of times clearer than the divine Ruins continent group. In other words, it was many times easier for Warriors to comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth here than in the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.</p><p>Lu Ming and more than 100 other young men stepped into the teleportation array and headed to the yuan continent.</p><p>It was the same feeling as riding in the space passage. After an unknown amount of time, that feeling disappeared, and they reappeared on a huge altar.</p><p>“This place … It’s a Snow Mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and realized that he was in a Snow Mountain.</p><p>little guys, welcome to the Dragon God Valley of the yuanlu!</p><p>Longyuan Shan’s deep voice resounded and he stepped out of the altar, ” “Come out, you’d better be prepared!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. He understood what Longyuan mountain meant. The laws of heaven and earth in the yuan continent were perfect, so the pressure between heaven and earth might be greater.</p><p>On the altar, because of the protection of the formation, he could not feel it.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“Yuanlu, I’ve finally arrived!”</p><p>These young men were extremely excited as they flew out of the altar.</p><p>However, after these young men flew out of the altar, their bodies trembled. A few of the weakest ones almost lost their balance.</p><p>“What a strong pressure!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew out of the altar as well. He instantly felt a terrifying pressure acting on his body. His body weight was also extremely shocking.</p><p>The pressure here was probably several hundred times, even a thousand times that of the divine Ruins continent cluster.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>“Also, it’s so cold!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt his body turn cold.</p><p>This was a Snow Mountain, and the temperature was shockingly low.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation, he could not feel the usual cold. However, the temperature here made him feel chilly.</p><p>“This Heaven Earth Yuan Qi …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath. In an instant, rolling original Qi between heaven and earth flowed into him. It was unimaginably dense.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that if he breathed casually, the amount of original Qi would be equivalent to the amount of a low-grade raw stone.</p><p>In the world, the original Qi was rich, while the spiritual Qi was extremely thin.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the distance, a burly elder wearing a short-sleeved shirt with his arms bare flew over and landed in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Longyuan mountain and the others greeted the old man.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll take my leave first. This Deacon long Yuanchuan will arrange your accommodation!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, Longyuan mountain and the others who had gone to the other continents to pick up people like him left one after another.</p><p>alright, come with me. I’ll take you to your living quarters!</p><p>After long Yuanchuan said that, he flew forward.</p><p>Everyone quickly followed. However, they had just arrived and the pressure from the outside world was too strong. They were not used to it yet.</p><p>This was after adapting to the transition station for half a month. Otherwise, it would have been even more difficult.</p><p>After flying down the snow Mountain, their field of view widened.</p><p>In front of them, a huge Glacier Valley appeared.</p><p>This Ice Mountain Valley was formed by the separation of two mountain ranges.</p><p>In the sky, snow was falling, and the world was covered in white.</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the distance and realized that there were also snow mountains in front of the huge Glacier Canyon. However, they were far away and in the vast snow, they could not see clearly.</p><p>Dragon Qi, so much Dragon Qi. What a strong Dragon Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming felt his nine Dragon bloodline heating up. He was shocked when he sensed it through his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Through the nine Dragon bloodline, he seemed to be able to see countless Dragon Qi rising into the sky from the glacier Valley and the snow Mountain in the distance.</p><p>In the huge Canyon, there was a lot of weak Dragon Qi. However, behind the canyon, in the vast Snow Mountain, there was some shocking Dragon Qi. Lu Ming was like an ant in front of it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming. His expression changed drastically, and he could not help but take a few steps back. He quickly retracted his senses.</p><p>so powerful! That aura far surpasses that of an Emperor. Is that the aura of a Saint? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>There were definitely Saints in Dragon God Valley, and there was more than one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
