I will let you know how useless you are!</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. For a moment, no one stepped out.</p><p>The silver flying badge’s combat strength was too strong. No one was confident.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>After a while, a young man in a yellow robe stepped out.</p><p>“Good, good, you have guts. Then I’ll ‘teach’ you a good lesson!”</p><p>Yin feizhang looked at the yellow-robed young man with a sharp and cold light.</p><p>The crowd retreated, leaving a large open space.</p><p>The silver flying badge and the yellow-robed youth stood opposite each other.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The yellow-robed young man didn’t hold back at all. A Dragon’s Roar resounded throughout the valley, and a yellow true dragon appeared above his head.</p><p>The nine golden chakra glittered. This was the bloodline of the yellow-robed young man.</p><p>The yellow-robed youth immediately used bloodline fusion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, a mountain peak appeared above the yellow true dragon’s head, exuding a powerful pressure.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>“Hehe, so it’s an Emperor spiritual weapon. You think it’s useful just because you have one? You’re really naive!”</p><p>Silver flying badge sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, with a flash of his body, his entire body was filled with a green radiance as he pounced toward the khaki-colored true dragon.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The yellow Dragon roared and pounced at the silver flying badge with its claws. At the same time, the mountain expanded rapidly and pressed down on the silver flying badge.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Silver flying badge’s figure flickered and suddenly multiplied into 18 figures. Each figure waved its hand and a Green Chain flew toward the yellow Dragon.</p><p>The eighteen chains were extremely fast. They instantly wrapped around the body of the yellow true dragon and wrapped around it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The yellow Dragon struggled with all its might, but the green chains were too strong to break free.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>The khaki-colored true dragon roared, and the Emperor spiritual weapon in the shape of a mountain peak pressed down on the other party.</p><p>“Heavenly wind Divine Art!”</p><p>Silver flying badge sneered. A green domain spread out and then turned into a huge palm print, hitting the mountain.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>With a huge explosion, the green palm print was destroyed, but the mountain also flew back.</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon was sent flying by the silver flying badge.</p><p>“What a powerful domain martial technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming could see clearly from the crowd that silver flying badge had been performing the domain martial art technique from the beginning to the end.</p><p>This was a domain martial skill that could change in thousands of ways. It pushed the power of the silver flying badge’s wind domain to the extreme. It was very mysterious and its power was shocking.</p><p>The yellow-robed youth’s bloodline fusion and his Emperor spiritual weapon would definitely be powerful.</p><p>On the continent of the divine Ruins, the yellow-robed young man was definitely able to fight against an Emperor, and he was even slightly stronger than an ordinary first level Martial Emperor.</p><p>However, he was still no match for Yin feizhang, which showed how strong Yin feizhang’s combat strength was.</p><p>Then, with a flash, the silver flying badge appeared on top of the yellow true dragon’s head and slapped it with its palm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The yellow Dragon let out a wail and then exploded, revealing the yellow-robed young man’s body.</p><p>Silver flying badge stomped on the face of the young man in yellow robe, directly pushing him to the ground, blasting a big hole.</p><p>Hmph, you want to fight me with this bit of combat power? you’re simply courting death!</p><p>you’re courting death! silver flying badge shouted coldly. He suddenly exerted more force on the young man’s face. The young man screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Many people looked indignant.</p><p>On the side, Yin Feng and another young man looked on coldly as if they were watching Yin feizhang stomping on a little chicken.</p><p>“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge this young master? just step forward!”</p><p>Silver flying badge said loudly.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>Hmph, since no one says anything, I’ll take it that you’ve all tacitly agreed to join young master yinfeng. Alright, then sign the blood oath contract now!</p><p>A scroll appeared in silver flying badge’s hand. When he unfurled it, it was covered in inscriptions.</p><p>“What? You still want us to sign a blood oath contract?”</p><p>no, we can’t sign a blood oath contract. If we do, we’ll really become your slaves and be under your control!</p><p>Instantly, the scene burst into an uproar, and many people shouted.</p><p>The blood oath contract was unique to the yuan continent. Once signed, it was the same as a blood oath that could not be violated.</p><p>In this case, wouldn’t they have to listen to Yin Feng’s control for the rest of their lives? how could these proud and ambitious heaven’s favorites from the various continents accept this?</p><p>“What’s with the noise? I’m telling you, you have to sign it today even if you don’t want to. Moreover, this blood oath isn’t for a lifetime. It’s only limited to the exploration stage of the secret realm, understand?”</p><p>Silver flying badge said, but everyone was still resentful. No one would sign.</p><p>“What a bunch of f * cking idiots!”</p><p>Silver flying badge started to lose his patience and scolded, ” do you think you are heaven’s pride experts? let me tell you, in the yuan continent, you are nothing. You are just a bunch of trash. If you don’t submit to young master yinfeng, I guarantee that you will not have a good life in the future!</p><p>danger lurks in every corner of the yuan continent. Ferocious beasts are everywhere. I guarantee that you won’t even know how you died. If young master yinfeng protects you, you will have a good cultivation environment!</p><p>This was already a blatant threat.</p><p>However, the power of his words was indeed strong. It made many young men hesitate.</p><p>That’s right. There were many experts in the yuan continent. While there were opportunities, there was also a high level of danger. They couldn’t stay in Dragon God Valley to cultivate their entire lives. They had to go out and temper themselves. If that happened, it would be really dangerous if Yin Feng and the others did anything.</p><p>Moreover, in a large sect like Dragon God Valley, having a backer was indeed much better than cultivating alone.</p><p>Some of the young men were tempted.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll sign it!”</p><p>“I’ll sign it too!”</p><p>Finally, someone spoke up and agreed to sign the blood oath contract.</p><p>Only then did a smile appear on Yin feizhang’s face.”This is more like it. Come up and sign!”</p><p>More than a dozen young men stepped forward and signed their names on the blood oath contract with their own blood.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man under Yin feizhang’s feet also signed the contract obediently.</p><p>“What about you guys?”</p><p>With the blood oath contract in hand, Yin feizhang walked to the young women and looked at them coldly.</p><p>The young women’s expressions kept changing. In the end, they gritted their teeth and signed the contract.</p><p>“You guys?”</p><p>Then, silver flying badge held the contract and looked at the others.</p><p>They had no choice but to lower their heads. They gritted their teeth and signed the contract.</p><p>Very quickly, about 50 people had signed the blood oath contract.</p><p>“We won’t sign it!”</p><p>Suddenly, a deep voice rang out.</p><p>Everyone looked over and found that the person who spoke was a simple and honest young man. Beside him, there were two people who looked exactly the same as this young man.</p><p>The triplets!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
