Behind him was a young man.</p><p>On the third altar, there were two strong cultivators from the Tian Yu demon sect. They were both middle-aged.</p><p>“Deacon, Deacon, save me! This Lu Ming wants to kill me!”</p><p>As soon as he saw the white-haired old man of the heavenly God sect, the burly man of the heavenly God sect was ecstatic and shouted madly as if he had found his Savior.</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly Divine sect shouted and people from several sides looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, How dare you!”</p><p>The white-haired elder of the heaven God sect reacted and shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the same time, the prison-suppressing stele shook and pressed down on the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>There was no time to lose. The major sects of the yuanlu continent had arrived early, which was out of Lu Ming’s expectations. However, he had to kill the burly man from the deity sect. Therefore, Lu Ming took action directly.</p><p>He was straightforward and decisive!</p><p>“No, no, you …”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect cried out in despair. He had not expected that Lu Ming would still have the guts to attack him after seeing the arrival of the white-haired elder from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele did not stop. As it pressed down, the burly man from the heavenly God sect was torn into pieces and his body and soul were destroyed.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A cold shout came from the sky. The white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect emitted an extremely terrifying aura. The strength of this aura far exceeded that of the burly man from before. In front of him, Lu Ming was like an ant.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Under this pressure, Lu Ming could not maintain the form of the prison-suppressing stele and it collapsed. Lu Ming’s real body appeared, pale and almost spitting out blood.</p><p>“What do you want to do? Do you think the disciples of Dragon God Valley are easy to bully? Get lost!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to give in, a loud shout was heard. The burly man from the Dragon God Valley shouted and an aura that was not weaker than the white-haired elder’s burst forth, blocking the white-haired elder’s aura.</p><p>Lu Ming then felt his body lighten and the pressure disappeared. He could not help but let out a long breath.</p><p>His heart was heavy.</p><p>Strong, they were too strong. Whether it was the white-haired elder of the tianshen sect or the middle-aged man of the Dragon God Valley, they were all too strong. They had surpassed Lu Ming by many times.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be very strong in the continent group of the divine Ruins, but compared to the experts of the yuan continent, he was much weaker.</p><p>He felt that if the white-haired elder of the tianshen sect and the middle-aged man of the Dragon God Valley wanted to kill him, they could do it with a flip of their hands.</p><p>“You want to stop me? This little b * stard killed the people of my Tian Shen sect in front of me. He must die!”</p><p>The white-haired old man looked at the burly man from Dragon God Valley coldly.</p><p>“Must die? How laughable. With me here, how are you going to kill him?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from Dragon God Valley stared at the white-haired elder.</p><p>“Are you deliberately going against my Tian Shen sect?”</p><p>The white-haired old man’s face was gloomy, and the burly man from Dragon God Valley sneered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, the white-haired elder moved and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“I knew you would sneak attack!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Dragon God Valley followed suit and punched the white-haired elder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, and the world rumbled.</p><p>However, the two of them condensed their power and did not release it. Otherwise, the ancient city of the divine Ruins would be in danger.</p><p>“If you want to fight, go up and fight!”</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>The brawny man from Dragon God Valley and the white-haired elder from the tianshen sect rushed into the sky and started a fierce battle.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying pressure came from the sky. A terrifying palm force was pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the young man from the heavenly God sect. At this moment, he suddenly made a move and launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming threw a punch at the sky.</p><p>When the fist and the palm collided, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could feel waves of energy surging towards him continuously. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure landed in front of Lu Ming. It was the young man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Brat, with your Supreme martial artist cultivation, you can take one of my palm strikes. Not bad, but I only used 30% of my power in that palm strike just now. Try taking another palm strike!”</p><p>The young man from the tianshen sect sent another palm strike at Lu Ming. The power of this palm strike was much stronger than the previous one.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. He exerted all his strength and cast the prison-suppressing heaven technique. The embryonic form of the chaos Domain covered his fist and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist collided with the palm print for the second time.</p><p>Just like the last time, Lu Ming felt an irresistible force surging toward him. He could not help but retreat.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and in disbelief.</p><p>That was because he could clearly see that his opponent’s realm was not ridiculously strong.</p><p>Second level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Moreover, he was at the early stage of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>At this level, if it was a martial artist from the divine Ruins continent group, he could kill them at will.</p><p>But now, except for the chaos sky-turning seal, he had used all his strength, but he was still no match for his opponent.</p><p>Moreover, he felt that the other party had not used his full strength at all. There was an unfathomable feeling about him.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that even if he used the chaos sky-turning seal, he might not be able to do anything to the other party.</p><p>The other party’s combat strength was too strong!</p><p>Could it be that the other party was a heaven’s chosen from the tianshen sect?</p><p>Lu Ming had all sorts of guesses in his heart!</p><p>interesting. If you can take my second palm, what about my third palm? ”</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect felt embarrassed after failing to kill Lu Ming with two consecutive palm strikes. His face turned cold.</p><p>The aura on his body was even stronger.</p><p>“You’re just putting on an act here. If you have the ability, fight me!”</p><p>At this time, a loud shout was heard. A burly young man suddenly appeared behind the young man from the heavenly God sect and attacked him.</p><p>The young man from the heavenly God sect turned pale. He could not be bothered with Lu Ming and turned around to fight with the burly young man.</p><p>The burly young man was the young man who had come with the burly man from Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The two of them fought, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>The cultivation of the burly youth from Dragon God Valley was similar to that of the youth from the tianshen sect. They were both in the early stage of the second level Martial Emperor realm. However, their combat strength was unusually amazing. Lu Ming felt that some of the weaker fourth level martial emperors on the continent group of the divine Ruins were not their opponents.</p><p>“Yuan continent is indeed not simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. His eyes shone with stronger anticipation.</p><p>Without a doubt, there were many experts in the yuan continent, far more than the continents of the divine Ruins. This made Lu Ming look forward to it.</p><p>And now, Lu Ming knew that it was very likely that the deity sect had a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele, which made him look forward to it even more.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he gathered all the fragments of the prison-suppressing stele, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele would definitely undergo a shocking change.</p><p>The battle between the two sides was extremely intense, but their combat strength was equal. It was difficult to determine the victor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
