Some people fled outside, while some people came towards Lu Ming and the others. When they sensed the fluctuations of the battle, they also retreated frantically in fear.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had a thought and Xie nianqing appeared.</p><p>...</p><p>“Xie nianqing!”</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing appeared, the eyes of the two middle-aged men from the Tian Yu demon sect lit up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s going on?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked around with a puzzled expression.</p><p>Previously, in the mountain and river diagram, she saw that her second body was severely injured while dandan and bubbles were unconscious. She could not help but feel very worried. Now that she saw that Lu Ming was fine, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the situation.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned as he saluted the two middle-aged men from the Tian Yu demon sect. The two men sized up Xie nianqing and nodded with a smile as if they were very satisfied.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation had reached the Supreme-being level, which surprised them but also satisfied them.</p><p>Two years ago, they had seen Xie nianqing. At that time, they were very clear about Xie nianqing’s cultivation. In the continent of the divine Ruins, he was able to break through to the Supreme-being realm in just two years. This kind of talent made them value Xie nianqing even more.</p><p>Following that, Xie nianqing mumbled to the two middle-aged men.</p><p>One of the middle-aged men nodded and flew into the sky. He joined forces with the burly man from Dragon God Valley to fight the white-haired old man.</p><p>“Tian Yu demon sect, you …”</p><p>The white-haired old man let out a furious roar. However, he was no match for the two experts ‘joint attack. He was suppressed and could only retreat quickly, flying out of the battle circle.</p><p>“Old man, if you want to fight, I don’t mind killing you today!”</p><p>The burly man from Dragon God Valley sneered.</p><p>“Good, very good. Do you really think that our Tian Shen sect is easy to bully? Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said angrily, but he didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>The white-haired old man stopped, and the two young men also stopped and retreated.</p><p>people of the continent of the divine Ruins, listen up. I am a Deacon of the deity sect in the yuan continent. Tell those disciples of the deity sect who have not gone to the yuan continent to get their asses here!</p><p>The white-haired elder’s voice spread far and wide.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from Dragon God Valley sneered and walked to Lu Ming’s side. He sized Lu Ming up and his eyes lit up. as expected of a prodigy who has awakened the nine Dragon bloodline. His talent is amazing. It’s only been two years, and his cultivation has already reached the Supreme level. It’s really rare in a place like the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>“Thank you for your help, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed.</p><p>“Haha, you’re a disciple of my Dragon God Valley. I’m long Yuanshan, a Deacon of Dragon God Valley. You can just call me Deacon long!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan said heroically. Then, he introduced the young man to the Dragon Guard.</p><p>“Right, what happened?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain’s eyes looked at the corpse of the burly man from the God of heaven sect and revealed a puzzled look.</p><p>He was well aware of the cultivation base of the burly man from the heavenly God sect. However, he found it unbelievable that he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and explained the matter roughly.</p><p>From two years ago, he was besieged by the burly man of the heavenly God sect and the others to the recent events.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not mention anything important. For example, he did not mention his entry into the chaos Hall, his cultivation of the chaos will, dandan, and bubbles.</p><p>It was only said that the burly man from the heavenly God sect was injured by the headless true dragon Knight at the core of the divine Ruins. He was killed because he was seriously injured.</p><p>damn it, the tianshen sect is so despicable. They secretly besieged and killed the disciples of my Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Longyuan Shan shouted in anger and looked at the white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect unkindly. He seemed to be thinking whether he should attack the white-haired elder or not.</p><p>The white-haired old man revealed a wary expression.</p><p>In the end, Longyuan mountain also had some apprehensions and did not make a move.</p><p>it’s good to kill such trash. It’s a pity that Long Chen was accepted as a disciple by the divine elephant sect’s experts. However, his bloodline is more suitable for the divine elephant sect!</p><p>Longyuan Shan mumbled. He then looked at Lu Ming and asked,”Lu Ming, did you really obtain a mixed-essence token in the battle of Providence?”</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He did not hide the fact that he had a primordial chaos token.</p><p>“Haha, that’s amazing. Who knows, you might have a fortuitous encounter in the future?”</p><p>Longyuan Shan’s eyes flashed with joy.</p><p>Then, he didn’t ask further.</p><p>In actual fact, there were many things that did not make sense in Lu Ming’s words. Longyuan mountain could naturally tell that but he also knew that it was Lu Ming’s Secret.</p><p>Lu Ming was so young and he had such a cultivation. It was normal for him to have some secrets.</p><p>however, some people from the divine Ruins continent are quite bold. They actually dared to attack the disciples of my Dragon God Valley. They should be taught a lesson. Dragon Guard, go and knock some sense into those who are still alive. Let them remember that our Dragon God Valley is not destroyed. Lu Ming is our disciple. If they want to deal with Lu Ming’s family and friends in the future, then they don’t need to exist anymore!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Dragon Guard nodded, then stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“Many thanks, Deacon long!”</p><p>Lu Ming expressed his thanks.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Longyuan mountain was doing this to appease him. Lu Ming really needed this favor.</p><p>Although most of the sovereigns in the divine Ruins ‘continent group had been killed by Lu Ming in the previous battle, Lu Ming was still very powerful.</p><p>However, the major forces still had some experts left.</p><p>Although there were not many experts left, Lu Ming was still worried that these people would cause trouble for the divine wilderness continent after he left.</p><p>However, with the help of the powerhouses of Dragon God Valley, these forces should be more obedient.</p><p>Not long after, a genius arrived. It was Ji Hong Chen.</p><p>Ji hongchen’s father, Ji Feng, did not participate in the capture of Lu Ming due to Ji hongchen’s advice. Hence, he was spared.</p><p>There weren’t many heaven’s favorites left in the heavenly God sect. There were only two of them. Soon, the two of them arrived. The white-haired elder of the heavenly God sect led them onto the ancient altar and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to go too!”</p><p>Xie nianqing came to Lu Ming’s side and said reluctantly.</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect had only come to pick up Xie nianqing. Now, they were about to set off.</p><p>little Qing, don’t worry. I’ve asked the seniors of Longyuan mountain. Dragon God Valley and the Tian Yu demon sect are in the same territory and not too far apart. I’ll visit you in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and said.</p><p>“Mm, okay!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and suddenly kissed Lu Ming on the lips.”Lu Ming, you have to work hard. Don’t let me surpass your cultivation the next time we meet!”</p><p>With that, she smiled brightly and turned to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled as he watched Xie nianqing and the two powerhouses from the Tian Yu demon sect leave. There was a hint of reluctance in his eyes.</p><p>“Little Qing, don’t worry. This separation is only temporary. When we both have the strength to move unhindered in the world, there will be no need to separate anymore!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His gaze became determined again.</p><p>A few days later, the news of Lu Ming’s battle with the powerhouses of the four great divine palaces spread wildly throughout the divine Ruins continent and to other continents.</p><p>In this battle, Lu Ming had killed the four divine palaces and all the top powerhouses from the other continents in one fell swoop. Countless people who had heard the news were dumbfounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
