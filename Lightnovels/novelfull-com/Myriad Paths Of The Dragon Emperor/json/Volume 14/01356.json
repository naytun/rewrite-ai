He had all sorts of esoteric crystals, elixirs, and other things.</p><p>Therefore, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou’s cultivation had also progressed very quickly. Now, they had both broken through to the sea of Souls realm.</p><p>Xiao Shan, although you’ve made rapid progress in your earth intent realm by using intent crystals, you haven’t excavated enough of it. In the future, you have to comprehend more and excavate more. It’ll be of great help to your future cultivation. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>“Understood, master!”</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan quickly nodded.</p><p>The two siblings looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of admiration.</p><p>Although the two of them were only Lu Ming’s in-name disciples, Lu Ming did not have any true disciples at all. He only had two in-name disciples. Hence, they had a very special status in the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Many experts, even emperors, would be very polite to them.</p><p>In the past, they would not have dared to imagine this. But now, it was happening right before their eyes. They understood that all of this was because of Lu Ming. Without Lu Ming, they would be nothing. Even spirit embryo realm martial artists would regard them as ants, let alone emperors.</p><p>But now, they only needed to say a word, and countless spirit embryo realm and even spiritual God Realm experts would risk their lives for them.</p><p>In fact, even the Emperor would help them.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>They also understood that they were not very talented. In the divine wilderness continent, there were many people who were more talented than them. They were lucky to become Lu Ming’s in-name disciples. It was a blessing that they had cultivated for several lifetimes. Therefore, they cultivated very hard.</p><p>Xiao Shan, I’ll display the earth concept for you to comprehend carefully!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice interrupted Zhuang Xiaoshan’s complicated thoughts. He quickly focused.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura of the will of the earth bloomed from Lu Ming’s body. The thick and heavy will of the earth enveloped Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>Zhuang Xiaoshan immediately closed his eyes, sat cross-legged, and quietly comprehended.</p><p>Xiao Rou, come over here and feel the water concept!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>yes, ” Zhuang xiaorou replied obediently. She blinked her big eyes and looked at Lu Ming with admiration.</p><p>In comparison, Zhuang xiaorou was more talented than Zhuang Xiaoshan.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the concept of water spread out. Like a river, it enveloped Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou quickly sat down cross-legged and began to comprehend.</p><p>Throughout the journey, Lu Ming only had time to teach these two disciples because he was free during this period of time.</p><p>In the past two months, everything had been developing in an orderly manner.</p><p>Some time ago, Lu Ming had invited nine sovereigns to cleanse Li Ping’s meridians and marrow with the serum as the foundation. Li Ping had been reborn from an ordinary mortal who could not cultivate and had become an extremely talented martial arts genius. During this period of time, she had been cultivating with Lu Yuntian and her cultivation had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had also helped Lu Yuntian, Hua Chi, and the others to improve their physiques and talents. Their cultivation base had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming sent out a purchase order to the entire divine wilderness continent. He was willing to purchase the seven main spiritual ingredients for the Nirvana elixir at a high price, hoping to refine another batch of Nirvana elixir.</p><p>The progress was rather smooth. During this period of time, he had already collected five out of the seven main mystical materials. It was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>The greater part of the construction of Dragon Emperor City had been completed. Zhang tie believed that it would be fully completed in two months.</p><p>Therefore, the higher-ups of the Dragon Alliance decided to hold an Alliance ceremony in the Imperial Dragon City three months later to announce to the world that the Dragon Alliance was officially established. At the same time, they would give each of the powerful figures and each of the major forces their own territory.</p><p>The entire divine wilderness continent was looking forward to that day. When that day came, the world would celebrate.</p><p>……</p><p>In the Western part of the divine wilderness continent, across the vast ocean, there was a continent called the White Feather continent.</p><p>This continent was the strongest continent in the southern divine Palace of the divine Ruins continent group. It was ranked fourth in the divine Ruins continent group.</p><p>In the eastern part of the White Feather continent, in a wild Valley, there was a cloud of blood mist surging wildly. It kept rolling and rolling. It was terrifying.</p><p>The valley was filled with the bones of demonic beasts.</p><p>Judging from the aura emitted by the skeletons, they were all extremely powerful existences. Most of them were advanced spiritual gods, and there were even quite a few Supreme-level ones.</p><p>After a while, the blood mist disappeared, revealing a figure.</p><p>It was Di Yi!</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming, I’ll definitely tear you into pieces!”</p><p>Di Yi roared, full of murderous intent.</p><p>Now, his aura was several times weaker than before. He was only at the first level of the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Also, the ten thousand meridians spirit body that he had cultivated for 10000 years had been completely burned away when he was escaping for his life.</p><p>damn it. My myriad meridians spirit body was about to succeed and become an earth grade spirit body. By then, my cultivation speed and combat strength would definitely increase greatly. I would definitely be valued by the family. It’s all Lu Ming’s fault!</p><p>Di Yi kept roaring and was extremely agitated. After a long time, he calmed down a little.</p><p>“The clan should have received the news that I’ve sent to them. The experts in the clan should be here soon. Lu Ming, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>……</p><p>Divine wilderness continent, Northern Plains.</p><p>Three hours later, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou woke up from their enlightenment.</p><p>alright, go back and comprehend it well. I’ll test you after a while and see the results of your cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming instructed.</p><p>“Yes, Master. Disciple will take my leave!”</p><p>Zhuang xiaorou and Zhuang Xiaoshan bowed and left.</p><p>“Let’s take a look in Dragon Emperor City!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, took a step forward, and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>More than half of the Imperial Dragon City had been built.</p><p>The construction of the Imperial Dragon City was done by martial arts and inscription Masters, selected from all the major forces, and even with the help of emperors. However, it still took such a long time, which showed how vast and majestic the project was.</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky above the Imperial Dragon City. He could not see the end of the city.</p><p>At the four gates of the Imperial Dragon City, there was a 10000-feet-tall statue. The owner of the statue was Lu Ming.</p><p>Entering from the South Gate, there was a passage called the path of the divine Dragon. It led to a square paved with white jade. There were countless seats around the square, which were prepared to receive guests from all directions.</p><p>The entire Imperial Dragon City was built on the original long Yue mountain. Long Yue mountain originally had a huge eye of Dao. Cultivating here would help one comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth much faster.</p><p>After that, several emperors moved a few more Taoist eyes from other places with great super powers, making the artistic conception of the Imperial Dragon City even clearer.</p><p>Moreover, the emperors had worked together to transfer a few spiritual eyes over. In addition, the emperors who cultivated the Dao of inscription had inscribed the energy-gathering formation here, so the spiritual Qi here was so dense that it was almost impossible to disperse.</p><p>The entire Dragon Emperor City became a Holy Land for cultivation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
