She continued to display terrifying techniques.</p><p>...</p><p>Bubbles was in a similar state. The blood-red light around its body was blinding as it chirped. The space where it stood was like water ripples that constantly trembled. It was as if it was the master of this world, and it was using terrifying killing techniques.</p><p>However, the burly man from the heavenly God sect was terrifyingly strong. He was engaged in a great battle with dandan and bubbles.</p><p>what powerful combat strength. Something is wrong with this combat strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely grave. The combat strength of the burly man from the deity sect was beyond his imagination.</p><p>The cultivation of the burly man from the heavenly God sect was equivalent to the sixth level of the martial Royal realm. However, his combat strength was completely out of Lu Ming’s expectations. It was not the sixth level of the martial Royal realm that Lu Ming had imagined. Instead, it was much higher.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed more than one fourth level Martial Emperor in the divine Ruins ‘continent group, so he was very clear about the combat strength of these fourth level martial emperors.</p><p>Although the LV 4 martial Royal realm experts on the continent of the divine Ruins had strong combat strength, there was still a gap. According to the combat strength of these Lv 4 martial Royal realm experts, he could roughly estimate that they had the combat strength of a Lv 6 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>However, the combat strength of the burly man from the heavenly God sect was much stronger than what Lu Ming had predicted.</p><p>“Could it be that the combat power of the yuan continent’s Martial Emperor is much stronger than that of the divine Ruins ‘continent? or is the burly man from the tianshen sect a combat genius? Or perhaps, it’s because his original realm was higher?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming moved and appeared next to the second body.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned after sensing it carefully.</p><p>The secondary body was severely injured. Half of its body had exploded, leaving only the other half. Fortunately, the soul that Lu Ming had split in the secondary body was not severely injured. Otherwise, it would have been equivalent to the secondary body dying.</p><p>However, the situation was not good. The clone would need a long time to recuperate before it could recover. During this period of time, the clone could not help Lu Ming.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he put the clone into the mountain and river diagram. Then, he condensed his vital essence into a ribbon and collected all the storage rings of the emperors.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battle between dandan, bubbles, and the burly man from the heavenly God sect had already turned white hot.</p><p>“Curse, this Lord will fight it out with you!”</p><p>Dandan shouted in the air, jumping left and right, and attacked in an endless stream. She had the Dao of inscription, the Dao of martial arts, and everything else.</p><p>As for the space-time spiritual mouse, it was much simpler. It used the space-time domain to fight against the enemy, but its power was extremely terrifying. The burly man from the heavenly God sect was extremely afraid of the bubble’s space-time domain because he would be fixed in place by the space-time domain if he was not careful.</p><p>It had to be said that dandan and bubbles were indeed powerful. They had just broken through to the Emperor realm not long ago, but when the two of them combined their strength and used all their skills, they were able to fight with the burly man from the heavenly God sect. One really did not know how terrifying they would be at their peak.</p><p>Very quickly, the two sides had exchanged over a hundred moves.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s finally done!”</p><p>At this moment, dandan suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>His figure suddenly retreated, and dense inscriptions suddenly appeared around the burly man from the heavenly God sect. This was a large array.</p><p>Previously, dandan was shouting and jumping around. It turned out that she was secretly setting up an array.</p><p>Now, the formation was finally complete.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The formation glowed. Between heaven and earth, nine huge turtle shells appeared. The turtle shells glowed and suppressed the heaven and earth of the burly man from the tianshen sect.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect shouted and slashed out with his sword, hitting a piece of turtle shell. However, the turtle shell only shook and was not broken.</p><p>“Little guy, do it! Go all out!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and opened her mouth to spit out a ball of chaotic light. Within the chaos, a world was evolving.</p><p>This time, the illusionary image of the world that dandan spat out was extremely real. The inscriptions inside interweaved and actually formed all kinds of living creatures, which suppressed the burly man from the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble cried out and waved its claws. A transparent bubble suddenly appeared around the burly man from the heavenly God sect and enveloped him.</p><p>This bubble was clearly different from the transparent bubbles that had appeared before. This transparent bubble had the shadow of a space-time spirit mouse circling it, howling at the sky.</p><p>“Break! Break! Break!”</p><p>The burly man of the heaven God sect seemed to have sensed the danger. He roared madly and his sword Qi burst out, trying to break the turtle shell Shield.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>A crack appeared on one of the tortoiseshells, and it exploded.</p><p>explode! Explode! Explode! Explode!</p><p>Dandan roared.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The illusory world that dandan had spat out suddenly exploded. At the same time, bubble’s transparent bubble also exploded.</p><p>The terrifying energy annihilated the entire territory, turning it into a pitch-black Mass. A terrifying destructive storm erupted in all directions, turning that place into a black hole.</p><p>Dandan and bubble’s bodies were sent flying far away by the destructive storm.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly rushed out and caught dandan and bubbles.</p><p>At this moment, dandan and bubbles ‘auras were extremely weak and their bodies were dim.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out weakly, her body curled up and she actually fell unconscious.</p><p>“Bubble …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Xiao Budian and I have burned our blood essence source and suffered great losses. I’m afraid we’ll have to sleep for a while. You have to prepare spiritual herbs when we wake up, a lot of spiritual herbs …”</p><p>Dandan said and fell unconscious.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and kept dandan and bubbles into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In front of him, the explosion was still going on, and it took a long time before it calmed down.</p><p>A figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect was actually still alive.</p><p>However, at this moment, he was extremely miserable. His entire body was in tatters, and wounds of various sizes covered his entire body as blood flowed out.</p><p>His aura was extremely weak, and there was a layer of true Yuan covering his body, allowing him to stand in the air.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect roared in anger. This was too tragic, he was too miserable.</p><p>He had already been struck by the headless true dragon rider’s curse power, causing his cultivation base to regress and it was difficult for him to recover. Just now, he was also severely injured by dandan and bubble, adding on to his injuries. Even if he recovered in the future, his cultivation base would regress and it would be difficult for him to improve again.</p><p>His anger seemed to be able to burn Half the Sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Before he could react, a cold killing intent enveloped him.</p><p>Lu Ming charged over. The embryonic form of the chaos Domain wrapped around the Dragon pattern sword and slashed at him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect raised the long sword in his hand and blocked in front of him.</p><p>The Dragon vein sword struck his long sword, causing his body to shake violently. His body flew out like a cannonball, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Now, he was no match for Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and charged at the other party.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll spare your life today.”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect roared and turned to run.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and chased after the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The burly man from the divine sky sect transformed into a beam of sword light. His speed was so fast that he seemed to be traveling through space. Lu Ming used the power of the air-frozen bead to help him and cast the wind element technique. However, he could not catch up with him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
