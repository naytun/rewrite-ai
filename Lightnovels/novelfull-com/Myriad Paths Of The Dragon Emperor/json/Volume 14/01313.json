His body trembled as he rushed toward qu Luo at top speed and threw a punch.</p><p>The two of them each threw out a punch, which collided in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening sound was heard. Then, under everyone’s shocked and incredulous gazes, qu Luo’s domain was crushed by Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>Qu Luo screamed as his entire arm was deformed. His body shook violently and he was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he did not move an inch.</p><p>“The heavens …”</p><p>Everyone looked at this scene with their mouths agape. They were completely stunned and tongue-tied, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Qu Luo, a demon Emperor, was sent flying by Lu Ming’s punch and his hand bones were broken. How was this possible?</p><p>This was simply like a fairy tale, something that was simply impossible to happen.</p><p>If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed it even if they were beaten to death. In fact, even if they had seen it with their own eyes, many of them didn’t dare to believe it and thought that they were dreaming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Many powerhouses couldn’t control their excitement, and a powerful aura burst out of their bodies. Xie Luan was no exception.</p><p>monster, what a monster. It seems like the people of the gate of God didn’t tell the truth. They must be hiding something!</p><p>Xie Luan muttered to himself, his face brimming with excitement.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu mumbled to himself as he trembled with excitement.</p><p>He had injured an Emperor with one punch. What did this mean? it meant that Lu Ming’s combat strength had at least reached the Emperor level.</p><p>you’re acting all high and mighty with this little combat strength. Who gave you the confidence? ”</p><p>Lu Ming strode in the void and charged at qu Luo at top speed, throwing another punch.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core to the maximum for this punch. There was also the power of nine dragon energies, the power of the third bloodline, and of course, the power of a 50% pure spirit body.</p><p>The terrifying power, coupled with the prison suppressing heavenly art, was extremely powerful.</p><p>Qu Luo roared as a saber appeared in his hand. He slashed out with all his might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The dazzling saber radiance collapsed under Lu Ming’s Iron Fist. The terrifying fist force hit qu Luo’s saber, causing him to tremble and retreat, blood spurting from his mouth.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure appeared above quluo’s head with the wind elemental technique. His hands quickly formed seals, and four gates of sealing appeared around quluo. The powerful sealing force imprisoned quluo in the void.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming did not give up on cultivating the nine seals of the divine Gate. Every day, he would take some time to comprehend it. After several months of hard work, the nine seals of the divine Gate had improved further. He could condense four sealing gates at once and was even more powerful.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and took eight steps in a row.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Qu Luo’s body trembled violently, and with every step he took, he spat out blood. In the end, he crashed to the ground like a meteorite.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and activated the Thunder origin spell. A lightning whip condensed from lightning flashed out and wrapped around qu Luo’s body, pulling him to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, qu Luo’s face was pale. Half of his body had been blown up, and blood was flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>This was also an Emperor. If it had been an ordinary ancient martial art practitioner, they would have been in grave danger. An Emperor had a spirit body, so they could recover after some time.</p><p>At this moment, quluo looked at Lu Ming with a gaze full of fear and disbelief.</p><p>The scene was silent, dead silent.</p><p>He had lost. Qu Luo had lost.</p><p>He had been completely defeated. In the face of Lu Ming, qu Luo was like a baby, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Quluo was an Emperor, and his cultivation had reached the late-stage of the first level Martial Emperor realm. He was not considered weak among the martial emperors. However, he was powerless against Lu Ming.</p><p>Was he still human? Was Lu Ming still human?</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Since when did a spiritual God Realm cultivator have such combat strength that he could easily crush an Emperor? this was unheard of since ancient times.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they looked at this scene in a daze, completely speechless.</p><p>“You, are very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at quluo and said indifferently.</p><p>These three words made qu Luo’s body tremble.</p><p>These three short words made him feel ashamed.</p><p>Just now, he thought he was the Emperor and looked down on Lu Ming. When Lu Ming said that he wanted to save the Tianxia Academy alone, he called Lu Ming arrogant and ignorant.</p><p>But now, it was proven that he was the arrogant one, and the ignorant one.</p><p>Quluo’s body trembled slightly. After a long while, he took a deep breath, lowered his head, and bowed deeply to Lu Ming. general Lu’s talent has shocked the world and surpassed the ancient Almighty. Quluo is ignorant and blind. Please forgive him, general Lu!</p><p>Quluo’s voice was sincere and sincere.</p><p>He was finally convinced, completely convinced.</p><p>He had never heard of such a prodigy since ancient times, at least not in the divine wilderness continent. It had exceeded his imagination, and he was finally convinced.</p><p>“General Lu’s talent has shocked the world!”</p><p>The other powerhouses in the surroundings were deeply touched. They also bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“General Lu’s talent has shocked the world!”</p><p>“General Lu’s talent has shocked the world!”</p><p>Following that, more and more people knelt down to pay their respects to Lu Ming. Their voices were louder and louder, and in the end, they echoed throughout the entire hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>After this battle, many people were truly convinced of Lu Ming’s abilities and acknowledged that he had formed an alliance with Xie Luan to become the Supreme Commander.</p><p>Previously, many people had addressed Lu Ming as ‘handsome Lu’ because of Xie Luan. In fact, they looked down on Lu Ming in their hearts.</p><p>However, after this battle, everyone truly regarded Lu Ming as someone on the same level as Xie Luan, or even higher.</p><p>He already had such combat strength before he broke through to the Martial Emperor realm. If Lu Ming broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, how powerful would his combat strength be?</p><p>It was unimaginable!</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void and accepted the worship of the powerhouses. His face was calm, like an invincible God of War.</p><p>“Go, go back and heal your injuries!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the lightning whip. Qu Luo flew far away.</p><p>“Thank you for your mercy, general Lu!”</p><p>Qu Luo bowed.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I haven’t seen you in a while. You’ve really changed my opinion of you!”</p><p>Xie Luan stepped forward, laughed, and asked, ” Lu Ming, did the experts of the gate of God hide anything when they came to the divine wilderness continent? ”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Now that he had established his prestige, there was no need to hide it.</p><p>this time, the deity sect is not the only one that came to the continent of the divine Ruins to recruit disciples. There are three other major sects!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“There are three other major sects?” Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>In their hearts, the major sects of the yuanlu continent were high and mighty existences that they could not climb.</p><p>This time, there were four of them.</p><p>Xie Luan seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>The people from the gate of God only said that Lu Ming had offended The Prodigy of the deity sect. However, if he had offended the deity sect, there were still three other sects!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
