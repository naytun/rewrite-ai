It was a shocking scene.</p><p>The continent group of the divine Ruins had an unprecedented shock.</p><p>...</p><p>After this battle, the continent group of the divine Ruins was destined to have a major reshuffling.</p><p>Then, there was news that the Dragon God Valley was not destroyed and was safe and sound. The news that the Dragon God Valley had been destroyed was false.</p><p>This piece of news made all the major factions keep quiet out of fear. They had no disloyalty towards Lu Ming and the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Even those peak experts had died. They didn’t want to die.</p><p>Furthermore, the Dragon God Valley had not been destroyed. Lu Ming was now a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. Even if they were given a hundred times more courage, they would not dare to touch the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The ancient Divine Ruins city, under the sacrificial altar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if there’s anything else you need to deal with, do it together. When you’re done, we’ll head to Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>Lu Ming looked towards the South. It was as if he had pierced through the void and landed on the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming shook his head and said,”No, senior, let’s go!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming left, he had already made all the arrangements for the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>And now, the matter of the divine Ruins continent group had already been resolved, so he did not need to worry too much.</p><p>The only thing he had to do now was to go to the yuan continent and cultivate. When his cultivation improved, it would be easy for him to come back and visit.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>The three of them ascended an ancient altar and stepped through the light door of the altar.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have stepped into a void channel. Countless lights and shadows flashed in his surroundings.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, his body shook and the light disappeared. Lu Ming found himself on an ancient stone platform.</p><p>Looking around, he was surrounded by desolate mountains.</p><p>“Is this the yuan continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around curiously and stepped out of the stone platform.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment he walked out of the stone platform, a terrifying pressure was exerted on Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he almost fell to his knees.</p><p>He exerted some strength to stabilize his body.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his body seemed to have become a few hundred times heavier. The surrounding air seemed to have become incomparably heavy and was constantly pressing down on his body.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was bewildered. He exerted force in his body to offset the external pressure.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you feel that your body has become a few hundred times heavier? there’s a strong pressure in the surroundings that’s acting on you!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan walked out of the stone platform and smiled.</p><p>“That’s right. Deacon, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, feeling extremely curious.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you want to understand what’s going on, you must first have a rough outline of the entire primordial realm’s geographical distribution!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan said. Then, he waved his hand and an image appeared in the sky. On the image, there was a vast ocean.</p><p>the primordial realm is a boundless ocean. In the ocean, there are countless continents, and the primordial continent is in the center of the ocean!</p><p>Longyuan mountain stretched out its hand and in the center of the ocean, a continent appeared.</p><p>This continent was very large. It occupied a large area even in the vast ocean.</p><p>This was the yuan continent!</p><p>in the primordial realm, the primordial land is the center and spreads out. There are countless large and small continents. In fact, most of them can’t be called continents and can only be considered islands!</p><p>Longyuan mountain then waved his hand. With Yuan continent as the center, numerous black dots appeared on the ocean.</p><p>These black dots were all continents. However, compared to the size of Yuan continent, they were like dust.</p><p>Even some of the bigger ones couldn’t be compared. The difference was too great.</p><p>“So many?”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. He looked at the ocean and the countless black dots that were densely packed together. He was filled with shock.</p><p>Could all of these be continents, continents like the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>Senior, where is that Divine Ruins continent group? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Here, here!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain pointed to the vast ocean in the South of the yuan continent, a corner that was extremely far away from the yuan continent.</p><p>There were some black dots scattered there.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>The divine Ruins ‘continent group was too far away from the yuan continent, and it was also too small. It was like a speck of dust, almost negligible in the entire picture.</p><p>Was this the divine Ruins continent group that he had been living in? In the entire primordial realm, it was so small that it was beyond Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>the entire primordial realm is a complete macro world. It is also very strange. The primordial land is the center of the primordial realm. The laws of heaven and earth are also the most perfect and flawless. Therefore, the heaven and earth on the primordial land are stable and the original Qi is rich. It is a true Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>with the yuan continent as the center and spreading out, the laws of heaven and earth will become weaker and weaker. They will become more and more incomplete. The space will become extremely unstable and the origin Energy will become thinner and thinner!</p><p>You can easily tear space in the divine Ruins ‘continent group, but here, can you try? ”</p><p>Longyuan mountain explained to Lu Ming patiently.</p><p>“It’s actually like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed. He took a deep breath and realized that the heaven and earth here was filled with rich Origin Energy. It was Origin Energy, not spirit energy.</p><p>Here, the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was very thin, and most of it was origin Qi.</p><p>He casually took a breath and the rolling original Qi gathered in his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>However, a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>His fist only pierced through the air and made a terrible whistling sound. However, the space didn’t move at all. There wasn’t even a ripple.</p><p>what a stable space. Unbelievable!</p><p>In the divine Ruins ‘continent group, he could easily tear space and pierce through the void, but here, there was not even a ripple in the space.</p><p>the closer we are to the yuan continent, the more perfect the laws of heaven and earth are. Everything in the world is also the most perfect and stable. Naturally, the gravity will be stronger and the pressure that people will feel will be stronger!</p><p>Longyuan mountain explained.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped heavily on the ground, causing the rocks to crack and a pit to appear.</p><p>“It’s so hard!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He could clearly sense that the rocks here were just ordinary rocks and not some hard metal ore.</p><p>Although he did not use his full strength, if he had been in the continent group of the divine Ruins, a mountain range would have collapsed. However, here, it was only a pit.</p><p>Even ordinary rocks were so hard.</p><p>Longyuan mountain was right. Everything in the world here had become more stable because of the perfection of the heaven and earth laws, far more stable than the continents of the divine Ruins.</p><p>The destructive power of a martial Royal realm expert here would be much lower than that of the continent group of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Of course, it also meant that it would be more dangerous for martial artists to go out and take risks.</p><p>This was because the power of nature had become stronger.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming soared into the sky and tried flying. As expected, the speed of flying here was at least a few dozen times slower than the divine Ruins ‘continents.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
