Furthermore, they were given the most central piece of land and the best cultivation environment.</p><p>Dragon Emperor City started to be boisterous.</p><p>In just half a month, millions of people had been transferred into the Imperial Dragon City through the inter-territory teleportation formation.</p><p>However, as for the huge territory of Dragon Emperor City, millions of people were just a small part of it. More and more people would move in gradually.</p><p>After moving to the Imperial Dragon City, many people started to be busy preparing for the Alliance-establishment ceremony.</p><p>All the powerful cultivators in the divine wilderness continent began to gather at the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>……</p><p>On this day, Di Yi and the others also stepped into the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>As soon as they entered, they heard that the Imperial Dragon City was going to hold an Alliance-establishing ceremony in a few days.</p><p>hehe, that’s good. I’ll kill Lu Ming at the so-called Alliance establishment ceremony!</p><p>Di Xian sneered.</p><p>“Young master di Xian, that Lu Ming can control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. He’s very powerful. We have to be careful!”</p><p>Di Yi said.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron controlled by Lu Ming was so powerful and shocking that even a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert would have to avoid it.</p><p>well, let’s go to ninedragons and seal the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron so that Lu Ming can’t use it!</p><p>Di Xian said.</p><p>Everyone tore open the space and headed toward ninedragons.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>The Alliance establishment ceremony officially began.</p><p>At the Imperial Dragon City, at the end of the divine Dragon passage, the square paved with white jade was full of experts.</p><p>Other than Western Desert, all the emperors had arrived.</p><p>There were hundreds of Supreme martial artists, and tens of thousands of sect Masters and sect leaders of various forces.</p><p>They sat down on the seats on both sides of the square.</p><p>These people were all at the pinnacle of the divine wilderness continent. They were all important figures who stood at the very top. Today, they were all gathered here.</p><p>Outside the square, there was an even more spacious place filled with banquet tables. There were at least a million people gathered here.</p><p>Not only that, across the divine wilderness mainland, all the factions of varying sizes were celebrating.</p><p>Today, the world was celebrating!</p><p>“The Vice Alliance master has arrived!”</p><p>A voice came from the sky and spread throughout the entire Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>Xie Luan and the old general, one on the left and one on the right, soared into the air and landed on either side of the square.</p><p>“Subordinate greets the two vice Alliance Masters!”</p><p>Everyone present stood up and saluted the two vice Alliance Masters.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>“Please rise!”</p><p>Xie Luan and the old general both raised their hands.</p><p>After that, Xie Luan and the old general fixated onto the deep place of Dragon Emperor City.</p><p>“The Alliance master has arrived!”</p><p>The voice from before rang out again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>All the onlookers were looking at the depth of Dragon Emperor City.</p><p>In the depths of the Imperial Dragon City, a few figures were approaching.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Lu Ming’s parents, Lu Yuntian, and Li Ping.</p><p>Today, Lu Ming had changed his clothes. He was wearing a long purple-gold robe with a majestic and lifelike nine-clawed true dragon embroidered on it.</p><p>Her long hair was tied up high, and she was wearing a purple-gold crown, Golden Dragon Boots, and a Golden Jade belt around her waist.</p><p>An invisible, powerful pressure was being emitted.</p><p>The four of them landed at the top of the square.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>At the scene, inside and outside the square, millions of experts bowed to Lu Ming. The sound waves gathered and the clouds in the sky were shaken away.</p><p>“No need for formalities, please sit!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and his voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>“Thank you, Alliance master!”</p><p>Millions of people began to take their seats.</p><p>“Today, we’re here to celebrate the establishment of the Dragon Alliance, and then, we’ll split the territories!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke. He did not say many words but many people’s hearts were beating faster.</p><p>The Dragon Alliance had unified the world, including Northern Plains, Eastern barren, Southern nether, central continent, and the other vast territories. How to enfeoff them and who to send to guard them were the questions everyone was concerned about.</p><p>There were huge benefits to be gained from this.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>Lu Ming announced.</p><p>The first step was for many factions, big and small, to step forward and make a blood oath to form the Dragon Alliance and rule the divine wilderness.</p><p>“Hahaha, it seems that I came at the right time today!”</p><p>At this moment, a burst of laughter came from the distance. A golden light flashed and a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>“That is … Di Yi!”</p><p>“It’s Di Yi!”</p><p>Many people shouted, and some people even showed fear on their faces.</p><p>Back then, Martial Emperor Di Yi had occupied almost half of the divine wilderness continent. He was too powerful. Many forces, big and small, had been ruled by Di Yi. Now that Di Yi had appeared, those people naturally panicked.</p><p>“Di Yi, you still dare to come here? That’s great. Today, I’ll use your blood as a sacrifice to the flag!”</p><p>Xie Luan bellowed, a burst of demonic Qi soaring into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. A look of doubt flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He could clearly see Di Yi’s current realm. He was only at the peak of the LV 1 martial Royal realm. In the last battle, Di Yi had injured his origin and his cultivation had dropped by one level.</p><p>With such a cultivation, any one of them could easily kill Di Yi, let alone Lu Ming, Xie Luan, the old general, or tu Qian.</p><p>Why did Di Yi still dare to come here?</p><p>Di Yi, let the others come out together!</p><p>Lu Ming said, looking behind Di Yi.</p><p>“Hahaha, let this young master show himself, and that will be the time of your death!”</p><p>A burst of laughter was heard as the space cracked open. Ten figures appeared in the sky, looking down at the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>“Who are these people?”</p><p>“I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Di Xian’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>good, very good! I heard that you killed two experts of my di family, di hongcheng and di Honglei, and even took away their Emperor weapons. Now, come over and hand over the Emperor weapons. Kneel down and beg me to spare your life. Perhaps I can consider sparing your life!</p><p>Di Xian put his hands behind his back and looked down at Lu Ming with a haughty look.</p><p>impudent! How dare you disrespect the Alliance master! You should be killed!</p><p>let’s go! a loud shout came from the square as a tall figure soared into the sky. A vast aura filled the entire place.</p><p>He was an Emperor. He used to be the Emperor of a dominant force in the central continent. His name was Martial Emperor Kongtian, and he had surrendered to Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, he had the lowest status among the many emperors in the Dragon Alliance. He had been looking for an opportunity to show off in front of Lu Ming and win his trust.</p><p>Now that he had such a good opportunity, he had to seize it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Martial Emperor Kongtian’s palm struck towards di Xian.</p><p>“How dare you disrespect young master di Xian, die!”</p><p>A middle-aged man walked out from behind di Xian. He held a sword with both hands and slashed.</p><p>A terrifying sword light instantly appeared above Martial Emperor Kongtian’s head. It broke through his attack and defense and slashed down.</p><p>Martial Emperor Kongtian screamed as he was cut in half. Even his spiritual God exploded and was destroyed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
