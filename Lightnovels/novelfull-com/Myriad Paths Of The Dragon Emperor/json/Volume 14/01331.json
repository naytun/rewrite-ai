His face was flushed red as he crawled up from the ground. His eyes flickered with a surging killing intent as he looked around and roared, ” “Who is it? Who was it? If you dare to attack me, come out and face your death!”</p><p>Under everyone’s watchful eyes, Xie Zhen’s battle blade was hit by a wine cup and he fell to the ground. This was undoubtedly an embarrassing matter, and it made Xie Zhen’s killing intent reach its peak.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>A chuckle came from the crowd, and a young man with a sallow face stepped out.</p><p>This young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>Even though he did not have a particularly deep relationship with tie Xing and the others, they had worked together for a while and had gotten along for a period of time.</p><p>Moreover, tie Xing and the others were implicated because of him. How could Lu Ming sit by and do nothing?</p><p>Lu Ming was the one who threw the wine glass just now.</p><p>you are a Prince, yet you are doing such a despicable thing. You are a despicable man. The ancient Saint dynasty only has themselves to blame for what they have done!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and walked towards Xie Zhen.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Some of the Xie family’s princes present berated him and stared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to interfere in my business? since you’re here today, don’t leave!”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s voice was cold. He waved his hand and said,”Attack and cripple his cultivation!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Seven or eight Imperial Dragon guards flew out, unsheathing all kinds of weapons as they charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the cultivation of these Imperial Dragon guards was only at the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm. They were not worth mentioning in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Inscriptions suddenly glowed on the ground, and a great formation appeared. In the formation, more than a dozen long sticks condensed and smashed toward the Imperial Dragon guards.</p><p>Bang! “Ah!”</p><p>Instantly, the sounds of whipping and screams of pain joined together. The Imperial Dragon guards didn’t have the slightest strength to fight back under the long staff’s strikes. In the blink of an eye, they were all whipped to the ground. Each of them had been hit more than a dozen times, their skin and flesh split open. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie Zhen’s face turned pale as he retreated.</p><p>His cultivation was only at the ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, not much stronger than those Imperial Dragon guards. Lu Ming could easily beat up seven to eight Imperial Dragon guards, so he was naturally not a match for him.</p><p>“Hmph, so you’re an inscription master!”</p><p>Xie Yan coldly snorted, a powerful aura exuding from his body.</p><p>Xie Yan was a second-grade heaven’s favorite. His cultivation had long broken through to the spiritual God Realm, and his combat strength was powerful, much stronger than Xie Zhen’s.</p><p>tenth Prince, this person is extremely daring. Since he dares to attack us here, I think he must have been sent by Lu Ming. Let me kill him!</p><p>A voice rang out from behind Xie Yan. A young figure stepped out and appeared in front of Xie Yan.</p><p>Wu chengkong!</p><p>He was Wu chengkong, the number one genius of the heavenly Sword faction!</p><p>Wu chengkong is going to attack. This man is dead!</p><p>in recent years, Wu chengkong’s cultivation has become more and more terrifying. This man is dead for sure!</p><p>this person is also stupid. He dared to make a move in such an occasion. It would be strange if he didn’t die!</p><p>The scene was filled with discussions.</p><p>Now, there were only a few big shots left in the divine wilderness continent. Wu chengkong was one of the strongest people below the big shots. His status was naturally not ordinary, second only to Ming Zi.</p><p>“With brother Wu here, I can rest assured!”</p><p>Xie Yan said as he took two steps back.</p><p>“Brat, are you going to surrender or wait for me to make a move?”</p><p>Wu chengkong’s eyes were as sharp as two swords.</p><p>Wu chengkong, back then, you were repeatedly abused by Lu Ming. Instead of hiding and cultivating, you dared to come out and bark. Aren’t you afraid of being abused again? ”</p><p>Lu Ming curled his lips and said sarcastically.</p><p>“Shut up, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wu chengkong was furious.</p><p>Back then, he had been ruthlessly abused by Lu Ming time and time again. That was his dark history and a disgrace to him. He would be furious whenever anyone mentioned it in front of him.</p><p>“I’ll cut off your four limbs and make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>Wu chengkong bellowed. He unsheathed his sword and slashed at Lu Ming with terrifying sword Qi.</p><p>so strong! Third level of the spiritual God Realm! This is the third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Wu chengkong has broken through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Wu chengkong’s attack caused a wave of exclamations.</p><p>At the third level of the spiritual God Realm, apart from those big shots and geniuses, who else could compete with him?</p><p>In their hearts, Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming did not look very old. He was very young and belonged to the younger generation.</p><p>But he had never seen him before, so he was obviously not famous. How powerful could an unknown young man be to be able to fight with Wu chengkong?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>An inscription appeared in front of Lu Ming once again. A formation emerged. It was exactly the same as the one that had brutally tortured the Imperial Dragon guards earlier.</p><p>More than a dozen long sticks appeared and struck toward Wu chengkong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Qi whistled through the air, and with a single slash, the dozen or so staves were all cut in half.</p><p>The sword Qi did not stop and continued to slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps and dense runes appeared on the ground. Another array appeared. It was the same as the previous one with more than ten long rods.</p><p>However, as the sword Qi swept past, the dozen or so long staves were cut into two again.</p><p>But immediately, another formation appeared, and the long stick formed again.</p><p>hehe, he’s using such a formation against Wu chengkong. He’s dead for sure!</p><p>this is all this person has. He dares to be so arrogant here. He really doesn’t know what’s good for him!</p><p>Someone sneered in disdain.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi whistled, and the long sticks were cut in half.</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>Wu chengkong roared and shook his sword. The sword radiance flashed and dozens of sword Qi were sent toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Each beam of sword Qi was extremely powerful.</p><p>“That kid is dead for sure,” everyone thought.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm, as if he did not see the sword aura. He took another light step.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>This time, more than a dozen formations appeared on the ground. All of them were identical and formed a long stick.</p><p>In total, hundreds of long staffs were thrown at Wu chengkong.</p><p>“So what if there are many? Break!”</p><p>Wu chengkong shouted, and his sword Qi became stronger.</p><p>However, the next moment, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>Originally, those long sticks were no different from dead branches in his eyes. He could easily cut them with his sword. But this time, when the sword Qi hit the long sticks, there were clanking sounds and sparks, but the long sticks were intact.</p><p>On the contrary, the sword Qi that he had released was destroyed by the long stick.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wu chengkong’s expression changed. He raised his cultivation to the extreme and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>However, his sword Qi was completely useless against those long staffs. As the long staffs struck down, his sword Qi dispersed.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Wu chengkong panicked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
