If there were nine, Lu Ming could only run away in defeat.</p><p>...</p><p>Could it be that even he couldn’t pass it?</p><p>Or perhaps, he could only pass it after he broke through to the Supreme-being realm?</p><p>Lu Ming had a few thoughts.</p><p>After a few more moves, Lu Ming rose and tore the nine blood-red Dragons apart.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after the nine Crimson Dragons were torn apart, Lu Ming continued to move forward but no other nine Crimson Dragons appeared.</p><p>After walking for a while, a huge underground cave appeared in front of him. As soon as Lu Ming entered, he heard a series of Dragon roars.</p><p>However, he could only hear the Dragon’s Roar and not see its body.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the air in the cave. He was completely attracted.</p><p>Seven blood-red beads floated in the air above the underground cave. Each bead seemed to be made of blood-red jade. They were smooth and round, and they emitted shocking energy fluctuations.</p><p>Blood essence, the blood essence of Nine Dragons!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened and his heart started to beat rapidly.</p><p>He had finally found the blood essence of Nine Dragons.</p><p>The remaining seven drops of nine dragon blood essence.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As if it had sensed something, Lu Ming’s spine heated up. The nine Dragon bloodline flew out on its own and opened its mouth to roar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The seven drops of nine dragon blood essence also trembled. Each drop was suffused with blood light, and a small dragon flew out, resonating with the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>“Refine it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He controlled the nine Dragons ‘blood and swallowed one drop of the nine Dragons’ blood essence.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the drop of nine dragon blood essence entered the mouth of the nine Dragon bloodline, it exploded and turned into infinite energy, fusing with the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and continued refining after refining one drop.</p><p>With every drop refined, a piece of information would appear in Lu Ming’s mind. It was the memory fragments of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming’s cultivation level did not increase. The energy in the blood essence was all integrated into the nine Dragon bloodlines. It seemed to be stored and made the nine Dragon bloodlines more and more real, almost like real Nine Dragons.</p><p>After seven days, seven drops of nine dragon blood essence were completely integrated into the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>At this moment, there was a lot of information in Lu Ming’s mind. They were all fragments of the nine Dragons ‘memory. These fragments slowly overlapped and formed a complete message.</p><p>true war Dragon technique-metamorphosis stage-Dragon God combat body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a smile.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique that he had cultivated before was the Foundation Stage.</p><p>The main content of the foundation establishment chapter was the content before the Martial Emperor realm. After the Martial Emperor realm, the foundation establishment chapter was useless and required the subsequent chapters.</p><p>Now, he finally got it.</p><p>The extraordinary chapter of the true war Dragon technique-Dragon God combat body, as the name suggested, was mainly about the cultivation of the spirit body.</p><p>The cultivation of a spirit body was to integrate the bloodline into the physical body and turn it into a higher level spirit body through the tempering of the lightning tribulation.</p><p>In other words, those below the rank of Martial Emperor were still mortals, while those above the rank of Martial Emperor had already transcended mortals and reached a higher level.</p><p>The extraordinary section was to transform the bloodline of the nine Dragons into the physical body and cultivate a spirit body. This spirit body was called the Dragon God combat body and was extremely powerful.</p><p>From the nine Dragons ‘memories, Lu Ming knew that spirit bodies were also divided into levels.</p><p>They were divided into ordinary spiritual body, earth spiritual body, and heaven spiritual body.</p><p>Each level was further divided into lower, middle, and upper grades.</p><p>According to the nine Dragons ‘memories and experience, in the divine wilderness continent, and even the divine Ruins continent, most of the spirit bodies of the emperors were low-tier ordinary spirit bodies, with a small number of them being mid-tier ordinary spirit bodies.</p><p>Xie Luan’s immortal demon body and Xia Jiuyang’s nine yang divine body should be superior ordinary spirit bodies.</p><p>If Di Yi’s myriad meridians spiritual body was successfully cultivated, it was likely to be a low-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>A low-grade earth spiritual body was extremely powerful and much stronger than a normal spiritual body.</p><p>It was a pity that Di Yi had spent 10000 years stripping away the bloodlines and essence blood of various experts, but he had not succeeded in cultivating it. It was not perfect, and its power was only equivalent to that of a superior ordinary spirit body.</p><p>That was why he wanted to steal Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons Blood essence. His goal was to cultivate the myriad meridians spirit body.</p><p>If he could successfully cultivate it, he would be invincible among emperors of the same level. Killing emperors of the same level would be a piece of cake for him, and even fighting against those of a higher level would be normal.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to successfully cultivate the Dragon God combat body, he would have a low-grade earthly spiritual body after he became a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Most importantly, the Dragon God combat body could be upgraded, just like his previous bloodline, which could be upgraded continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming was very tempted by this.</p><p>Another thing that tempted Lu Ming was that if he cultivated his spirit body with the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and transformed into the dragon God combat body, he might be able to retain the nine Dragons’ devour skill.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had been struggling with which Blood Meridian he should use to cultivate the spirit body when he broke through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele bloodline seemed to be stronger than the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>As for the third bloodline, it was even more mysterious.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had made up his mind to cultivate the spirit body with the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>He could keep the prison-suppressing stele and the third bloodline. He felt that even after he broke through to the Emperor realm, these two bloodlines would still be of great use to him.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming looked at other memories.</p><p>“Yes, it’s much less!”</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Originally, he had thought that he would be able to obtain the complete memories of the nine Dragons after fusing with the nine drops of blood essence.</p><p>But now, he realized that it wasn’t the case. A large portion of his memories were blank.</p><p>For example, where did the nine Dragons come from? What had happened back then? with the nine Dragons ‘combat strength, why had they fallen?</p><p>Who killed the nine Dragons? What happened in the heavenly realm?</p><p>These important memories were a complete blank.</p><p>“Could it be that the nine Dragons did this on purpose before they died?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>However, although he didn’t have these memories, the other memories were still priceless treasures.</p><p>In his memory, there were some powerful combat skills that could only be cultivated after breaking through to the Emperor realm or higher.</p><p>Every single one of them was a priceless treasure.</p><p>At the same time, through the nine Dragons ‘memories, Lu Ming finally knew the cultivation realms after that.</p><p>After the Martial Emperor, it was the martial Saint!</p><p>Martial Saints were also known as the Saint realm or Saint realm.</p><p>A martial Saint could live for more than 100000 years. They were unparalleled in battle strength and could dominate the world. Compared to them, emperors were thousands of miles away.</p><p>However, the martial Saint realm was not the highest realm, nor was it the peak.</p><p>Above the martial Saint realm was the peak, which was the martial sovereign!</p><p>A Martial Emperor was also known as a great emperor.</p><p>This was the true pinnacle of the world. Their lifespans were almost endless, and they stood at the peak of the world. They were unbelievably powerful. With a wave of their hands, they could probably destroy a mainland like the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>This world did not only refer to the primordial realm, but also the heaven realm.</p><p>A Martial Emperor was a peak expert.</p><p>Back then, the nine Dragons were at this realm, and the top ten war beasts were all at this realm.</p><p>“Martial Emperor, great emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with yearning.</p><p>His goal was to stand at the peak of the world. He had to become a martial Supreme in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fists were clenched tightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
