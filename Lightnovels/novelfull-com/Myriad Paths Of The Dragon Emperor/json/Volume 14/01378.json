He seemed to have discovered that someone was following him.</p><p>...</p><p>what a strong spiritual sense. Is this The Sixth Sense of a woman? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled in his heart.</p><p>Ji hongchen had not actually noticed him. Perhaps it was because of his innate spiritual perception that Ji hongchen had sensed that he was being followed. That was why he had stopped and berated him.</p><p>However, when Ji Hong Chen’s Holy sense swept out, he did not discover anyone.</p><p>“Strange, did I sense it wrong?”</p><p>Ji hongchen muttered to himself, thinking that he was hallucinating. Just as he was about to move forward, his pupils suddenly shrank and a trace of shock appeared in his eyes.</p><p>This was because a young man had appeared in front of her without her knowing. He was looking at her with a smile that was not a smile.</p><p>This shocked her greatly and she subconsciously retreated.</p><p>“Who are you? Were you the one following me?”</p><p>Ji hongchen berated.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had changed his appearance, Ji hongchen naturally could not recognize him.</p><p>“Miss Ji, how have you been? do you still remember this Lu?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. At the same time, his figure began to transform into Lu Ming’s original appearance.</p><p>After thinking about it, Lu Ming decided to take a gamble and come out to meet Ji hongchen.</p><p>Lu Ming really needed help. He had previously learned that Ji hongchen was the daughter of the head of the Ji family, one of the ten great families of the southern deity Palace. If he had Ji hongchen’s help, it would be much more convenient for him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>After seeing Lu Ming’s true face, Ji hongchen let out a soft cry.</p><p>She was in disbelief.</p><p>Now, all the experts in the world were looking for Lu Ming to capture him. Who would have thought that Lu Ming would come to the South God Palace?</p><p>“I’m honored that miss Ji still remembers me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Ji hongchen took off the black veil on her head and revealed her beautiful face. She sized Lu Ming up and said,”Lu Ming, how dare you come to the South God Palace and show up in front of me? aren’t you afraid that I’ll get someone to take you down?”</p><p>“I believe that miss Ji is not such a person!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Ji hongchen’s eyes flickered and a smile appeared on his face. He then rolled his eyes and said, ” “Lu Ming, there must be something for you to appear in front of me, right?”</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming has something to ask miss Ji for help!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned solemn as he cupped his fists.</p><p>“Oh? Tell me, I might not be able to help you!”</p><p>Ji hongchen said.</p><p>“Miss Ji, is Long Chen being held in that mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. Long Chen is locked up inside. Lu Ming, you’re trying to save Long Chen, aren’t you? I advise you to give up on that idea. There’s no way you can save him. The security is too tight!</p><p>Ji hongchen sighed.</p><p>“Although the realm energy chain formation is profound, it’s not impossible to break!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You know about the realm energy chain formation?”</p><p>Ji hongchen was taken aback. He then continued, ” “Since you know about the realm energy chain formation, you should know how difficult it is to enter.”</p><p>the auras of the ten people in the realm energy chain formation are the auras of the ten great clan patriarchs of the South God Palace, right? ” Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Ji hongchen didn’t try to hide anything as he nodded his head.</p><p>“Therefore, Lu Ming has something that he would like to ask miss Ji for help with!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you want me to help you obtain the auras of the top ten family patriarchs?” Ji hongchen’s beautiful eyes widened as he spoke.</p><p>“That’s right, with miss Ji’s status, it shouldn’t be too difficult!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Aura!</p><p>Once a person touched something, an object, there would be a trace of aura.</p><p>For example, the clothes that one had worn, the utensils that one had used, or the hair of a human body would all have a scent.</p><p>As long as he could obtain these, it would be enough.</p><p>The patriarchs of the 10 great clans of the South God Palace were all at the LV 4 martial Royal realm. It was impossible for ordinary people to detect their auras. However, Ji hongchen was different. Her father was a clan patriarch. With her status, it was still possible for her to detect the auras of the 10 great clan patriarchs.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although I feel that it’s unfair for the South God Palace to treat you and Long Chen like this, it’s really not easy to save Long Chen. Even if you have the aura of the ten great clan chiefs, can you refine the array breaking token? The method of making the token is top secret. Even I can’t get it!”</p><p>Ji hongchen said.</p><p>“Don’t worry about this, miss Ji. As long as I have the aura of the ten great clan chiefs, I can refine the array-breaking token!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with confidence.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Ji hongchen found it hard to believe.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was not only talented in martial arts, but also a powerful inscriber?</p><p>As far as she knew, even if one knew how to refine it, it was impossible to refine it without the cultivation of a ninth-level Alchemist.</p><p>“Of course it’s true!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a golden mental energy fire jumped between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. It was dazzling.</p><p>Ji hongchen’s beautiful big eyes suddenly widened. His small mouth was slightly agape as an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming was really a level-nine Alchemist?</p><p>In that case, when the major sects of the yuanlu continent were selecting their disciples, Lu Ming did not use his full strength at all?</p><p>Just based on martial arts alone, he was able to suppress everyone, and his Dao of inscription had even reached the Emperor level. What a freak!</p><p>Ji hongchen wailed in his heart.</p><p>“Miss Ji …”</p><p>Lu Ming put away the mental energy fire and called out to Ji hongchen a few times. Ji hongchen then came back to his senses from the shock. Her beautiful eyes blinked and stared at Lu Ming, causing Lu Ming’s hair to stand on end.</p><p>“What a freak!”</p><p>In the end, Ji hongchen mumbled something that made Lu Ming roll his eyes.</p><p>alright, I promise you. I’ll help you get the aura of the ten great clan chiefs!</p><p>After a moment of silence, Ji hongchen nodded his head.</p><p>“Miss Ji, I still have a question. Would you like to ask?” Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>by right, Long Chen and I have been selected by the Dragon God Valley as their disciples. How could the South deity Palace and the other three great deity palaces have the guts to deal with us? it seems like you have no scruples at all!</p><p>Lu Ming asked the biggest question in his heart.</p><p>This question had been bothering Lu Ming.</p><p>He and Long Chen were disciples of the Dragon God Valley. How dare these people from the divine Ruins continent treat them like this? weren’t they afraid that the experts of the Dragon God Valley would come and kill them?</p><p>If he had done it secretly, it would still be acceptable, but now, he was clearly doing it openly.</p><p>Lu Ming, you don’t know yet, do you? a few months ago, the tianshen sect sent news that the Dragon God Valley in the yuan continent was destroyed!</p><p>Ji hongchen revealed a shocking piece of news.</p><p>“Destroyed?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley, a major sect in the yuanlu continent, had been destroyed.</p><p>In that case, everything made sense.</p><p>If Dragon God Valley was destroyed, what would the experts on the continent have to worry about?</p><p>Lu Ming was also speechless. He had joined a big sect in the yuan continent after much difficulty. Now, he had not even entered the sect and was already destroyed.</p><p>It seemed that the danger level of the yuan continent was much higher than the continents of the divine Ruins. A great sect had been destroyed just like that.</p><p>It seemed that even if he went to the yuan continent in the future, he would have to find a new sect to join.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
