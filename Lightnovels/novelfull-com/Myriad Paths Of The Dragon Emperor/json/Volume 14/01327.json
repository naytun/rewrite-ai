It was simply nonsense for a great circle of the spiritual God Realm to be able to fight a peak second level Martial Emperor. They felt that the rumor was too exaggerated.</p><p>Indeed, who would believe such a thing without seeing it with their own eyes?</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you want to try?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the armored Martial Emperor with a faint smile.</p><p>that’s right. I have the same intention. I don’t believe that a mere spirit God can defeat an Emperor!</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor suddenly stood up, and an extremely strong fighting spirit emanated from his body.</p><p>This was a person who loved to battle!</p><p>Most people in the heaven suppressing divine Army loved to fight.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, let’s fight outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward. He appeared in the sky outside the hall.</p><p>Today, he knew it would not be so simple. If he did not show some of his skills, the heaven suppressing divine Army would not dare to bet on him.</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor also flew out of the hall and stood in the sky, facing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>The rest of the people left the hall and stood in the air.</p><p>The cultivators in other places of the heaven suppressing divine Army also sensed the situation here. They rose into the air one after another and looked over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, make your move. Show me what you’ve got!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor’s fighting spirit was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>“If you want me to make the first move, sure, three moves!”</p><p>“If you can take three of my moves and not be defeated, I admit defeat!” Lu Ming extended three fingers and said.</p><p>“What? Three moves, Lu Ming is so arrogant!”</p><p>does he really have the combat strength of a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert? ”</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused a commotion and heated discussion.</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor sneaked a glance at Xie Luan, only to see him standing there with a calm smile on his face, as if he had already known the result.</p><p>“Could it be that Lu Ming is really as terrifying as the rumors say?”</p><p>Even now, the battle Martial Emperor still found it hard to believe.</p><p>“Good, good, I’ll see how you’re going to defeat me in three moves!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor’s eyes flickered with anger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of his body, and his genuine vitality burned like flames. His territory spread out, and his muscles swelled. In an instant, the armored Martial Emperor’s strength was raised to the extreme.</p><p>Although he did not believe that Lu Ming was as exaggerated as the rumors, there was no smoke without fire. He would not be careless when he was facing Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Casting the wind elemental technique, Lu Ming’s figure flickered and rushed toward the armored Martial Emperor like a Phantom. At the same time, Dragon roars were heard and nine streams of dragon energy burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the prison-suppressing stele’s shadow appeared on his fist.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor’s expression changed drastically when he saw Lu Ming’s punch. The power of this punch shocked him and made him feel great pressure.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The power of this punch was too terrifying. It wasn’t something a spirit God expert could release. It had reached the Emperor level.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor roared and punched out.</p><p>The two fists met in the air!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Rings of shock waves spread out in all directions.</p><p>The realm covering the armored Martial Emperor’s body trembled violently, as if it would collapse at any time. Then, his face turned pale, and his body flew backward with a bang.</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor was sent flying with one punch, which made the people of the heaven suppressing divine Army gasp.</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor only managed to stabilize himself after flying for a hundred miles.</p><p>“The second move!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said calmly. He took a step forward and traveled a hundred miles in an instant. At the same time, the third bloodline appeared above his head. A wave of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body and his strength increased again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The second punch was thrown!</p><p>“Explosive Army shattering fist!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor roared, and his hair stood up. He exerted all his combat strength and punched out.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a second punch.</p><p>But this time, the armored Martial Emperor was even more miserable. His domain was instantly destroyed, and his body and arms made cracking sounds. His body flew far away, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor was severely injured by the second move.</p><p>“Do you want another round?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor roared. He was an Emperor. He would not allow himself to be unable to withstand three moves from Lu Ming.</p><p>He had to survive three moves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor’s body swelled up. At the same time, a huge shield appeared in his hand. His territory covered the shield, giving it an indestructible feeling.</p><p>This move, he took a defensive stance.</p><p>“The third move!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted. He stepped into the air and threw his third punch.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the prison-suppressing heavenly art for this punch. Instead, he used a martial technique of intent.</p><p>The fusion of five martial techniques of intent!</p><p>Right now, the fusion of five martial arts techniques had a might that surpassed the prison suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>The main thing was that with the upgrade of the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline, the level of the prison suppressing heavenly technique had long surpassed the low-grade divine level martial arts technique. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could not unleash the full power of the prison suppressing heavenly technique.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s cultivation level broke through to the martial Royal realm and his essential core was strong, the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique would naturally increase.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The punch hit the armored Martial Emperor’s shield.</p><p>The shield was covered with a realm, but under this punch, the realm collapsed instantly like a blister. The shield let out a violent boom, forming a sound wave that spread out, tearing the space apart.</p><p>Then, a shocking scene appeared. The shield was changing its shape. The spot where Lu Ming’s fist landed on the shield caved in. The armored Martial Emperor’s expression changed drastically in an instant.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor couldn’t hold the shield at all, and the heavy shield hit him like a mountain.</p><p>Pi Li pa la!</p><p>A series of bone-breaking sounds came from the armored Martial Emperor’s body. His body flew far away and fell on the ground. He spat out a mouthful of blood and couldn’t move for a while.</p><p>The armored Martial Emperor had been defeated. He had been completely defeated.</p><p>Facing Lu Ming, he was suppressed and had almost no power to resist.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>Many people swallowed their saliva and looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of horror. They no longer had any doubts.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength completely overpowered an ordinary Martial Emperor. It would not be too difficult for him to kill an armored Martial Emperor.</p><p>Perhaps the rumors were not exaggerated and were true.</p><p>The people of the heaven suppressing divine Army changed their minds.</p><p>amazing, amazing! Little brother Lu is really unparalleled and the number one in history!</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor strode out with a look of admiration on his face.</p><p>But then, the baizhan Martial Emperor changed his tone and said, ” however, I still want to learn from you. It’s not that I doubt brother Lu, but I have to be responsible for all the members of the heaven suppressing divine Legion!</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor stood in front of Lu Ming. A powerful aura rose from his body, which was several times stronger than that of the armored Martial Emperor.</p><p>He was right. For the sake of the heaven suppressing divine Legion, he had to know Lu Ming’s combat strength clearly.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the warring Martial Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
