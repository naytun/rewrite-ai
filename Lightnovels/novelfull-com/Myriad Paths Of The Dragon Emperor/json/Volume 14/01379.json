I’ll take my leave first. I’ll come to you again when I find the aura of the clan leaders of the top ten families!</p><p>Ji hongchen said. Before she left, she blinked her eyes and looked at Lu Ming. do you really believe me? aren’t you afraid that I’ll find some experts to take you down? if that’s the case, the two primordial chaos tokens will be in our hands!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and said,”didn’t I just say it?” I believe in miss Ji!”</p><p>Ji hongchen smiled and flew away.</p><p>After Ji hongchen left, Lu Ming changed his appearance again and returned to the periphery of the mountain, the area that he was in charge of.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ji hongchen came to look for Lu Ming the next night.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is the teacup that my father once drank from. I believe it will be useful to you!”</p><p>Ji hongchen passed Lu Ming a Jade teacup.</p><p>“Thank you, miss Ji!” Lu Ming received it in joy.</p><p>Ji hongchen gave a faint smile and left without saying anything.</p><p>Following that, the detailed diagram of the air vein chain formation appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>During this period of time, he had thoroughly analyzed the mysteries of the realm energy interlocking formation and reflected them in his mind.</p><p>Then, he took out a jade talisman and extracted the Ji family’s aura from the teacup. He absorbed the aura into the Jade talisman and began to carve inscriptions on it.</p><p>Three days later, the first token was successfully refined.</p><p>As long as one held this token and entered the formation corresponding to the Ji family’s head, the formation would not issue any alarm.</p><p>Unfortunately, the realm energy linking formation required ten tokens. One less token was useless.</p><p>After a few more days, Ji hongchen sent over the aura of the second clan head.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s easy for me to get some family heads who are on good terms with my father. However, it’ll be troublesome for some family heads who are on opposing sides with my father. I’ll need some time!”</p><p>Ji hongchen said to Lu Ming before he left.</p><p>Lu Ming could understand. After all, this was a fourth level martial Royal realm expert. It was not easy to obtain the aura of the clan leaders of the ten great clans of the South deity Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming could only refine the aura in his hands into a token.</p><p>Other than guarding the array, Lu Ming spent the rest of his time cultivating alone to strengthen his mental energy fire. It did not take up much time.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the outside world, Lu Ming’s main body would occasionally appear to attract people’s attention besides cultivating.</p><p>More and more experts took part in the pursuit of Lu Ming. In addition to the experts from the other three great divine palaces, the experts from the continent of the divine Ruins and other continents also came to the continent of the divine Ruins one after another.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was proficient in the illusionary breath technique and could change his aura. Moreover, he had powerful combat strength. Every time he appeared, he would stir the air and escape easily.</p><p>Just like that, more than four months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was getting closer and closer to the two year agreement with the big sects of the yuanlu continent.</p><p>After more than four months, Lu Ming had already refined seven array-breaking tokens.</p><p>Now, Ji hongchen’s speed of obtaining aura was getting slower and slower. The time he needed was getting longer and longer.</p><p>Because the rest of the people were enemies of the Ji family, it would be difficult to get their aura.</p><p>Night fell!</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on a bluestone and closed his eyes to cultivate. Between heaven and earth, there were strands of invisible power of inscription that descended from the inscription law and was absorbed by Lu Ming. The mental energy fire in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness slowly grew stronger.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked ahead.</p><p>“It’s here again!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Two black shadows shuttled through the array silently. No one noticed them except Lu Ming.</p><p>These two figures were not Ji hongchen. They were someone else.</p><p>Two months ago, these two figures had been secretly observing the mountain’s realm energy chain formation.</p><p>Behind him, Lu Ming observed secretly and finally discovered something.</p><p>The two people who were observing in the dark were actually experts from the Wang clan, one of the ten great clans of the South God Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the Wang family also wanted to refine the token. Their goal was simple-to take long Chen away and keep the primordial chaos token for themselves.</p><p>After a while, the two figures retreated.</p><p>After the two of them left, another figure came forward. It was Ji hongchen.</p><p>This time, Ji hongchen had brought the eighth aura.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there are two other types!”</p><p>Ji hongchen’s face was slightly Haggard. It was obvious that she had put in a lot of effort in this short period of time in order to obtain the aura of the ten clan heads.</p><p>Lu Ming was very touched.</p><p>After Ji hongchen left, Lu Ming continued to refine the array-breaking token.</p><p>Time flew by, and another month passed. Ji hongchen had delivered the ninth aura.</p><p>It had been five months since Lu Ming entered the South God Palace.</p><p>After Lu Ming received the aura, he began to refine the array-breaking token. However, something happened that night.</p><p>More than a dozen black shadows shuttled through the darkness, heading towards the depths of the mountain.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The dozen or so black shadows were all experts, all emperors.</p><p>There was even one whose cultivation was unfathomable. He was a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>there aren’t many fourth level martial emperors in the entire South God Palace. Could it be that the Wang clan’s clan master has personally made a move? the Wang clan has sent so many experts this time. Could it be that they have already refined ten formation-breaking tokens? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess. Runes appeared on his body and he restrained his aura to the extreme. His figure flashed and he followed behind the dozen figures silently.</p><p>When he arrived in front of the realm energy chain formation, the strongest Man waved his hand and took out ten Jade tokens.</p><p>As expected, the other party had refined ten array-breaking tokens, one step ahead of Lu Ming.</p><p>The ten array-breaking tokens emitted a layer of light that enveloped the dozens of black shadows. The dozens of black shadows rushed into the realm energy chain array without causing any waves.</p><p>Not long after, a dozen black figures rushed into the cave and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows tightly.</p><p>Now that the plan had changed and exceeded his expectations, he could only take one step at a time.</p><p>Not long after, more than a dozen people reappeared at the entrance of the cave, but this time, there was one more person in the middle.</p><p>Long Chen!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately saw Long Chen among the group of people.</p><p>Long Chen’s face was pale as he was being carried by someone.</p><p>It was obvious that Long Chen had suffered a lot during this period of time, but his eyes were still determined.</p><p>More than a dozen people took Long Chen and quickly passed through the formation, arriving at the outermost formation.</p><p>They were about to pass through the formation and escape.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, powerful auras suddenly burst out.</p><p>There were over a hundred of them.</p><p>Then, hundreds of figures descended and surrounded the dozen figures.</p><p>“Wang Sheng, you really want to keep the primordial chaos token for yourself. You found someone to privately refine the formation breaking token, do you think we don’t know?”</p><p>A white-haired old man coldly shouted.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The one with the strongest aura among the dozen or so people laughed heartily. He circulated his true essence, and the black robe wrapped around him shattered, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>It was the Wang family’s patriarch, Wang Sheng!</p><p>As for the others, they were obviously experts from the other clans of the South God Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
