Everything would be devoured and they would become a dried corpse.</p><p>...</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>“Call the strong!”</p><p>The Army was in chaos, and many people retreated in shock.</p><p>The Army was thrown into chaos because of Lu Ming alone, and a gap appeared.</p><p>“Who is so audacious, daring to attack my empyrean heaven divine Palace?”</p><p>A loud shout was heard. Then, more than ten figures flashed and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>A few of them were Lu Ming’s old acquaintances.</p><p>The Wang clan’s patriarch, Wang Shengtian, the Jiang clan’s patriarch, and the Luan clan’s patriarch.</p><p>Three of the clan heads of the six great ancient clans of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had come.</p><p>More than ten people followed behind the three clan heads. Three of them were Supreme-level experts, while the others were all at the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm, at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“You … It’s you …”</p><p>The Masters of the Wang and Jiang families were stunned when they saw Lu Ming. They stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you. Didn’t you die? He died in the divine Ruins continent, in the hands of the divine God sect’s Paragon?”</p><p>After a long while, the crowd finally recovered. The Wang family master pointed at Lu Ming and exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>The news of the experts from the divine Gate’s South God Palace coming to the divine wilderness continent and announcing Lu Ming’s death had long spread throughout the divine wilderness continent. Almost all the powerful factions knew about it.</p><p>Wang Shengtian and the others had thought that Lu Ming had died in the divine Ruins continent. They were naturally surprised to see him now.</p><p>“You didn’t die, so how could I die?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“So you didn’t die. You’re really lucky. But you’re really stupid. Since you didn’t die, you should’ve hidden. Now you’ve come out and even come here. You’re really seeking death. Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family laughed out loud, revealing a ferocious killing intent. The aura on his body bloomed, locking onto Lu Ming, afraid that Lu Ming would escape.</p><p>“You? Last time in ninedragons, you managed to escape with your life. This time, I won’t let you escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan shouted angrily.</p><p>Previously, in ninedragons, Lu Ming had almost killed the master of the Wang family with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. The master of the Wang family had regarded this incident as taboo. Now, Lu Ming had brought it up again in front of everyone, and it had hit the master’s sore spot.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family exuded a cold killing intent. He stepped forward, and purple flames emanated from his body, completely annihilating the void.</p><p>The temperature was rising rapidly, and some of the weaker cultivators immediately backed away.</p><p>“I will burn you to ashes!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family said coldly. He pushed his hands forward and a large purple fireball flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The purple fireball’s temperature was terrifyingly high. Wherever it flew, space would be annihilated, revealing black spatial passageways.</p><p>In an instant, it flew in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan laughed sinisterly.</p><p>But the next moment, his smile froze.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a hand and grabbed at the purple fireball. The purple fireball shrank rapidly and finally turned into a wisp of fire, burning and jumping in Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“This is your flame? You even want to burn me to ashes. In my opinion, it’s not even enough to cook rice!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He then blew and the flame in his palm was extinguished.</p><p>It was a slap in the face.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The master of the Wang family’s face was flushed red. He glared at Lu Ming and wanted to bite him to death.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The master of the Wang family bellowed, and the flames on his body burned even more vigorously. A ball of purple flames appeared above his head. Moving his body, he performed the blood fusion and turned into flames. The flames twisted and finally turned into a purple flame sword, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look. He threw a punch at the purple sword.</p><p>A miserable shriek was heard as the purple sword collapsed. The figure of the Wang family’s patriarch appeared. Blood was spurting out of his mouth. His face was filled with fear as he retreated frantically.</p><p>As soon as the master of the Wang family retreated, screams immediately rang out. The path he took was the Army, and he directly crashed into the Army. At least a thousand people were killed by him.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The others roared and began to flee in a frenzy. The battlefield of paragons was simply too dangerous. If you were too close, you wouldn’t even know how you died.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the Wang family master and strode forward.</p><p>“Save me, quickly save me!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan cried out in fear.</p><p>At the side, the Masters of the Jiang family, the Luan family, and the others were stunned. When Lu Ming injured the master of the Wang family with one punch, they were really stunned and found it hard to believe. Now that the master of the Wang family had called out, they came back to their senses.</p><p>“Attack and kill this person!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Masters of the Jiang and the Luan families shouted and attacked together.</p><p>The five Supreme-beings attacked at the same time. Five different beams of light cut through the void and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out the word coldly and threw five punches in a row.</p><p>Five fist forces broke through the air.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The force of the punch easily dispersed the attacks of the five Supreme-beings, and the Masters of the Jiang and the Luan families grunted as they were sent flying backward, blood spurting from their mouths.</p><p>He casually threw out five punches and severely injured five Supreme martial artists. This caused countless people who had retreated to the distance to gasp. As for the Wang clan’s clan master, he was scared half to death.</p><p>He was so stunned that he thought he was dreaming.</p><p>How long had it been? Lu Ming had only made a trip to the divine Ruins continent. How did he become so powerful the moment he returned? his combat strength completely crushed his. Was he still a member of the younger generation?</p><p>Lu Ming continued to charge at the Wang family’s master. The Wang family’s master roared in fear and retreated desperately into the crowd, hoping that someone else would help him block Lu Ming.</p><p>you guys, stop him! Hurry up! Damn it! How dare you run away? I’m the confidant of His Majesty, Martial Emperor Di Yi. You’re courting death. I’ll kill you all in the future!</p><p>The Wang family and the Wang family roared, but the rest were not fools. When they saw the family head of the Wang family approaching, they all fled. No one stopped Lu Ming for him.</p><p>What a joke. He injured five Supreme martial artists with a single punch. If they went up, wouldn’t they be courting death?</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan was almost in despair.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a black saber radiance burst out high in the sky, cutting through the void and slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Its power was extremely terrifying!</p><p>The Emperor had made his move!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from within Lu Ming’s body. He threw a punch and it collided with the saber radiance. Lu Ming successfully blocked the saber radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was an old man in a black robe. He was thin and his eyes were sunken like a skeleton.</p><p>However, the aura that he exuded was extremely terrifying.</p><p>This was an Emperor!</p><p>“The third hell-Emperor!”</p><p>Seeing this person, the Wang clan master was ecstatic and almost laughed out loud.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
