I can test out the strength of a pure spirit body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was revealed. His figure soared into the sky and rushed towards the thousand-mile giant hand.</p><p>“An ant dares to resist? you’re courting death!”</p><p>At the bottom of the sea, a furious roar was heard again. The thousand-mile giant hand grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who is the ant?”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted coldly. The nine streams of dragon energy burst out in his body. The pure spirit body circulated and filled Lu Ming with infinite power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and cast the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>The punch collided with the thousand-mile giant hand.</p><p>With an earth-shaking boom, the thousand-mile hand gave off a blue light and then suddenly exploded in the air.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>An unbelievable roar came from the depths of the ocean. The sea water churned and a blue figure rushed out of the ocean.</p><p>It was an ape that was more than three meters tall. Its entire body was covered in blue fur, and it exuded a terrifying aura. It stared at Lu Ming with a ferocious gaze, still in disbelief.</p><p>He could not believe that Lu Ming could destroy the huge hand that he had condensed with one punch.</p><p>how is it possible for a mere great circle spirit God? ”</p><p>The ape was even more incredulous when it saw Lu Ming’s cultivation level.</p><p>“A sea suppressing divine ape. Interesting. It’s a good choice to take him in as a helper!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the ape and revealed an interested expression.</p><p>The sea calming ape was a type of divine beast.</p><p>However, it seemed that this sea suppressing divine ape wasn’t a pure-blood before it broke through to the Emperor realm. Instead, it transformed into a sea suppressing divine ape after it broke through to the Emperor realm. There was still a huge difference between it and a pure-blood Divine beast.</p><p>“What did you just say? You want to take me in as your hatchet man? you’re just a mere ant, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, the sea suppressing divine ape flew into a rage. It took a step forward, and the endless sea water in the ocean seemed to obey the ape’s command. The endless sea water turned into a giant stick that was thousands of miles long. The sea suppressing divine ape held it in its hand and smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you’re not convinced, then I’ll beat you until you’re convinced!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, and his third bloodline appeared. Lu Ming borrowed a wisp of the third bloodline’s power to make it even stronger.</p><p>As for blood fusion and chaos will, Lu Ming did not plan to use them yet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the prison suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Heaven and earth shook, and the sea water churned, creating thousands of waves.</p><p>The giant rod that was condensed from seawater exploded with a single punch from Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique and his figure was like a Phantom as he pounced toward the sea suppressing divine ape at extreme speed.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape’s expression changed drastically. It let out a furious roar and charged toward Lu Ming while emitting blue light.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>After a few moves, the sea suppressing divine ape let out a blood-curdling screech and was sent flying for thousands of miles. It spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This sea suppressing divine ape wasn’t even as strong as the purple-and-golden-robed elder, let alone the fact that the elder had an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had cultivated a pure spirit body and his combat strength was even stronger. He could easily suppress the sea suppressing divine ape without even using the bloodline fusion or the chaos will.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can he be this strong?”</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape’s heart was filled with question marks and disbelief.</p><p>It could not figure out how a mere martial artist in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm could possess such terrifying combat strength.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the sea suppressing divine ape turned around and ran. It was about to rush into the sea.</p><p>“You can’t run away!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element art. His figure swayed as he approached the sea suppressing divine ape and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was the fusion of five martial techniques of intent.</p><p>The terrifying power made the sea suppressing divine ape shiver all over. It felt that there was no way to escape.</p><p>He roared and tried his best to fight back. Unfortunately, he was completely defenseless against Lu Ming’s punch and was sent flying a thousand miles. His body almost exploded and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His aura was weak.</p><p>One move and he was seriously injured.</p><p>“Surrender to me, or else, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and crossed thousands of miles to arrive in front of the sea suppressing divine ape. He looked at it with a cold gaze.</p><p>In particular, Lu Ming had borrowed the power of the third bloodline. The cold and merciless killing intent made the sea suppressing divine ape’s heart and body turn cold.</p><p>“I surrender, I surrender!”</p><p>In the end, the sea suppressing divine ape had no choice but to lower its head.</p><p>“I’m going to inscribe a restriction on you. Otherwise, I won’t be at ease. Dandan, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>It flew toward the sea suppressing divine ape. The sea suppressing divine ape was helpless. At this moment, its life was in Lu Ming’s hands, so it could only set up the restriction.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this sea suppressing divine ape’s mansion is at the bottom of the ocean. There are many treasures there!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles also waved her little claws, her face full of excitement. There were two bubbles at the tip of her nose, one big and one small.</p><p>“Dandan, this fellow, has led bubble astray!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Plop! Plop!</p><p>Dandan and bubbles rushed into the sea impatiently.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape was helpless. Now that he had joined Lu Ming’s side, he would definitely lose his mansion and treasures.</p><p>“Lead the way, I’ll also go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed the sea suppressing divine ape.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape bowed and replied. Then, Lu Ming and the sea suppressing divine ape entered the ocean together.</p><p>In the depths of the ocean, there was a divine mountain with countless spiritual herbs growing on it.</p><p>This place was the sea suppressing divine ape’s residence.</p><p>On the divine mountain, there were also some powerful sea demonic beasts. However, they had already been flipped over by dandan and Paopao. The two fellows were desperately picking spiritual herbs and stuffing them into their mouths.</p><p>“Haha, this is a hundred thousand year old bejewelled nectar!”</p><p>Suddenly, loud laughter was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming and the sea suppressing divine ape stepped into the sacred mountain. At the top of the mountain, they saw a small pool filled with a blue crystal-like liquid. The liquid emitted an extremely dense life aura.</p><p>At this moment, dandan and bubbles were rolling around in the small pool and drinking in big gulps.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>When the sea suppressing divine ape saw this scene from the side, his liver, lungs, and entire body ached in pain.</p><p>Even it could not bear to use this pool of nectar, but now, dandan and bubbles were drinking it in big mouthfuls. Every mouthful felt like they were biting its flesh.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming, it would have gone crazy.</p><p>“What bad luck!”</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape wailed in its heart, lamenting its bad luck to have met Lu Ming. It would lose its freedom in the future, and all the wealth it had accumulated for a lifetime would be ruined by dandan and Paopao.</p><p>“You two guys, leave some for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He took out a big Jade bottle and poured the Nectar into it by activating his essential core. He only stopped after the bottle was filled to the brim.</p><p>It was not that Lu Ming was satisfied, but that the bejeweled nectar in the pool was all gone. It had all gone into dandan and bubbles ‘stomachs.</p><p>“What a waste!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached.</p><p>The serum was even more precious than the life potion. A single drop was hard to come by, and its value was immeasurable.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
