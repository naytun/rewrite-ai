However, I have already defeated him. I have also joined another major sect in the yuanlu continent, Dragon God Valley!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes shone with an astonishing light.</p><p>general Lu has joined a major sect in the yuanlu continent!</p><p>The hearts of many other experts trembled, and their eyes also bloomed with a bright light.</p><p>“General Lu’s talent has shocked the world!”</p><p>Someone shouted again, extremely excited.</p><p>This time, he was even more pious and respectful than before.</p><p>Previously, it was because of Lu Ming’s ability. This time, it was because of Lu Ming’s identity.</p><p>Lu Ming had already joined a major sect in yuanlu and was a disciple of a major sect. In the eyes of everyone, his status had suddenly become high and mighty, even surpassing that of Xie Luan.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed down with one hand and the scene immediately quieted down.</p><p>I’ll talk about the details later. Now, according to the original plan, I’ll rush to the Tianxia Academy first and rescue it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, general Lu, we’ll go with you. It’s too dangerous for you to go alone!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor spoke.</p><p>“Yeah, we’ll go with you!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said.</p><p>no need. You guys stay here and guard. I know what I’m doing. I won’t let myself be in danger!</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, he did not say anything more. He waved his hands in the air and the void split open. Lu Ming stepped in and disappeared.</p><p>Even after Lu Ming had disappeared, the crowd’s excitement had yet to calm down.</p><p>The main reason was that the shock caused by Lu Ming was too shocking.</p><p>When Lu Ming went to the divine Ruins continent, his cultivation level was low. But now, he was able to suppress emperors. This kind of progress was too amazing.</p><p>no, we can’t let Lu Ming take the risk alone. Moon Heart sovereign, sky wind sovereign, you two take some men and guard this place. Mo Ye, barbarian Emperor, you two follow me and secretly head to Tianxia Academy. If Lu Ming is in danger, we’ll help him!</p><p>Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>“Fiend ancestor, I’ll go too!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu and qu Luo stepped out and said.</p><p>Although qu Luo had been injured by Lu Ming, his origin was not injured. At this moment, the effect of the spirit body was activated and he was rapidly recovering. Half of qu Luo’s body that had been damaged had already recovered.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had been merciful. If his source was injured, it would be impossible for him to recover so quickly.</p><p>“Good, you all will set off with me!”</p><p>With that, Xie Luan tore open space and led a group of experts to the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>……</p><p>The Tianxia Academy was in a state of war.</p><p>Most of the Tianxia Academy’s territory had already been occupied by the Ditian divine Palace. Only the White jade Palace had not been broken through.</p><p>The White jade Palace was suspended in the air, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>The White jade Palace was surrounded by an Army.</p><p>In the Army, there were people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, the southern underworld, and some from other Overlord forces of the central continent. They had joined Di Yi and fought for the world with him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the top of the White jade Palace, there were two majestic figures. They were shrouded in endless divine light and exuded a terrifying aura. It was the pressure of an Emperor.</p><p>The two figures were emperors, and they were launching attacks at the White jade Palace.</p><p>Inside the White jade Palace, there were two white-haired old men. They were also exuding the aura of emperors. They were working together to resist the attacks of the emperors outside.</p><p>attack! Attack together! This white jade Palace won’t be able to hold on for long!</p><p>In the crowd, a purple-robed middle-aged man was giving orders.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely be able to recognize this man at a glance. He was the master of the Wang family, one of the six great ancient aristocratic families of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, Wang Shengtian.</p><p>Now, he was in high spirits.</p><p>He was one of the first group of people to follow Martial Emperor Di Yi. He was Di Yi’s trusted aide. Since Martial Emperor Di Yi showed his true strength, he had been invincible. The strength of the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace had become stronger and stronger as they grew older.</p><p>However, those forces that joined later on and those experts naturally did not have a higher status than him. Only emperors had a higher status than him. Those Supreme martial artists were a head lower than him and had to curry favor with him and listen to his orders.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>From all directions, countless attacks and light rays attacked the White jade Palace. The White jade Palace was completely submerged in the light rays.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>In the White jade Palace, the disciples and elders of the Tianxia Academy shouted and attacked with the array of the White jade Palace, trying to resist.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>However, there were too many attacks from the outside world. The White jade Palace was rumbling and shaking. If this continued, they wouldn’t be able to hold on for long.</p><p>Tianxia Academy, I advise you to surrender quickly. His Majesty, Martial Emperor Di Yi, is a hero of the ages. He has received the order of the heavens and will unify the divine wilderness continent. If you resist, you will only be seeking your own death!</p><p>The voice of the Wang clan’s patriarch spread far and wide.</p><p>Hmph, Di Yi is a Wolf with wild ambitions. He wants to unify the divine wilderness continent? dream on!</p><p>our Tianxia Academy would rather be destroyed than surrender!</p><p>Voices came from the White jade Palace.</p><p>The master of the Wang family’s face darkened and he snorted coldly, ” you really don’t know what’s good for you. I’ve given you a chance, but you don’t know how to cherish it. Then die. Continue attacking!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Tens of thousands of attacks and rays of light flew toward the White jade Palace. The intense battle continued.</p><p>At this moment, a thousand miles to the North of Tianxia Academy, space cracked open and Lu Ming stepped out.</p><p>“It seems that I’m not too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the distance and muttered. Then, he took a step forward and headed toward the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming covered the distance of a thousand miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Who are you? stop right there!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming approached, he was discovered.</p><p>A group of black-robed martial artists with a sinister aura all over their bodies had their eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>“The people of the southern nether!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he continued to move forward.</p><p>The people of the southern nether were very easy to recognize.</p><p>“Brat, stop! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>An expert in the third level of the spiritual God Realm slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a palm and clenched it in the air. Devouring power erupted from his palm and enveloped the third level spiritual God Realm Southern nether expert. His body was directly fixed in the air and he could not move at all.</p><p>Then, to his horror, he realized that the blood essence, fresh blood, vital essence, intent runes, and other things in his body had all flown out of his body and into Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Such a strange scene scared him so much that he screamed.</p><p>However, every few breaths, his body would shrivel up, and he would lose all signs of life.</p><p>“What evil technique? Let’s attack together and kill this man!”</p><p>At the side, when the others saw this scene, they widened their eyes in shock. Then, they roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. An even stronger devouring force erupted and enveloped the group of people. They were all turned into mummies and their corpses fell to the ground like raindrops.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack!”</p><p>Terrified screams rang out. More people noticed Lu Ming and attacked him.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void as if he was taking a stroll in a courtyard. The devouring power burst out, leaving a trail of dried corpses wherever he went.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
