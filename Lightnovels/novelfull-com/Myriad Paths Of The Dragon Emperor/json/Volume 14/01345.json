Everyone was shocked.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>A peak second level martial Royal realm expert with an Emperor spiritual weapon had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>Would this battle be turned around because of Lu Ming?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the battlefield closest to Lu Ming, tu Qian, Xia Jiuyang, and Martial Emperor Di Yi exchanged a blow and both parties retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body broke through the void and appeared beside Martial Emperor Di Yi, forming a pincer attack.</p><p>join forces to besiege me. That’s good. We’ll kill them all!</p><p>At this moment, Martial Emperor Di Yi was still very powerful, and his eyes were like swords.</p><p>Di Yi, I don’t need to gang up on you to kill you. Today, I’m going to settle the score with you!</p><p>Lu Ming said, locking his aura on Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>senior Jiuyang, tu Qian, you go help the others. Leave Di Yi to me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Tu Qian listened to Lu Ming’s instructions. He would do whatever Lu Ming said. He nodded and flew away to join the other battle groups.</p><p>With a swing of the axe, an Emperor was immediately cut in half.</p><p>not good! Let’s join forces and form a battle formation!</p><p>An Emperor roared.</p><p>Tu Qian’s participation had undoubtedly broken the balance. Some emperors roared, and some of them gathered together to form a battlefield and defend with all their might.</p><p>This way, he could barely deal with tu Qian.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Said Xia Jiuyang. He was a little worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>senior Jiuyang, it doesn’t matter. Di Yi and I must make a decision today!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then be careful!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang warned before he also charged towards the other emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s team started to gain the upper hand.</p><p>In the beginning, they had fewer emperors on their side and were at a slight disadvantage. However, the situation had now reversed.</p><p>After Xia Jiuyang left, only Martial Emperor Di Yi and Lu Ming were left.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two sides stood opposite each other, their killing intent rumbling.</p><p>After many years, Lu Ming finally stood in front of Di Yi and fought him.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming had experienced endless dangers and hardships. He had finally reached this point and reached his current combat strength, which was enough to fight with Di Yi.</p><p>Because of the blood essence of the nine Dragons, the two of them had become enemies, and there was bound to be a battle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Heat waves spread out from Lu Ming’s spine, and a blood-red light permeated the air. It was the abnormal movement of the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>At the same time, a blood-red light spread out from Martial Emperor Di Yi’s body, and a faint dragon roar could be heard.</p><p>“Nine dragon blood essence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Through the nine Dragon bloodline, he could sense the nine dragon blood essence in Martial Emperor Di Yi’s body.</p><p>Unlike Lu Ming, Di Yi’s blood essence of Nine Dragons was not awakened. Instead, it was integrated into the body.</p><p>When Di Yi got the blood essence of Nine Dragons, he was already in the Martial Emperor realm. He couldn’t use it to awaken his bloodline. He could only use it to refine.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Di Yi did not want to delay any longer. He rose up and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The second body stepped into the void, and large formations appeared one after another. All kinds of trapping and attacking formations emitted all kinds of light and blasted toward Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>At the same time, the sword Qi whistled, and five Phoenix Feather flying swords stabbed toward Di Yi.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele, carrying the chaos concept, also attacked Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi’s combat strength was very strong, even slightly stronger than the red-robed elder. However, he was also caught up in the situation of the red-robed elder. He was embarrassed by the joint attack of Lu Ming’s main body and second body. He could not exert his strength at all.</p><p>After fighting for a while, Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll show you my strongest combat power today!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi let out a furious roar. His body began to glow. All kinds of light emitted from Di Yi’s body.</p><p>These rays of light condensed into all sorts of strange phenomena.</p><p>There were true dragons dancing in the air, phoenixes screeching, even Qilin stepping in the air, divine birds flying in the sky, and iron swords flying in all directions …</p><p>All kinds of strange phenomena appeared on Di Yi’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw Nine Dragons among them.</p><p>ten thousand meridians spirit body!</p><p>Di Yi let out a long roar, and his body exuded a terrible fluctuation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Di Yi’s combat power was greatly enhanced. His golden sword swept across the sky, and sword Qi cut through everything.</p><p>The formation set up by the Ming Lian clone was instantly destroyed by the sword Qi.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The combat sword hit the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. The bloodline shook violently and flew far away.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the fragment of the prison-guarding stele’s original body, which greatly increased his defense. Otherwise, Lu Ming would not dare to fight it head-on. His Blood Meridian would have been scattered.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>The five Phoenix Feather flying swords were sent flying, and the second body was the same, retreating continuously.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Di Yi’s combat power suddenly increased greatly, all because of the strange phenomenon of his body.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that Di Yi must have cultivated a powerful spirit body. The spirit body that he cultivated with the blood essence of ten thousand spirits was far more powerful than ordinary spirit bodies when it exploded.</p><p>“Spirits of all living things, kill!”</p><p>Di Yi shouted. The various creatures in his body suddenly roared and turned into a rainbow light, rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming saw the shadows of a nine-Dragon, a true dragon, and a Qilin among them. They exuded a shocking aura as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled as it unleashed the prison-suppressing heavenly art. It was infused with the chaos intent and was constantly bombarded.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued.</p><p>Di Yi, holding his sword, attacked Ming Lian’s clone.</p><p>“I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Di Yi said coldly.</p><p>In his eyes, the secondary body was even more difficult to deal with. It had many tricks up its sleeve. As long as he killed the secondary body first, Lu Ming’s main body would not be a threat.</p><p>Di Yi, you think you can kill me? today, I’ll show you something!</p><p>Ming Lian’s face was calm and he smiled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ming Lian waved his hand, and a scroll flew out. It then grew rapidly and enveloped Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>“All formation illustration, Lian Cang’s all formation illustration!”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi shouted angrily.</p><p>then I’ll let you have a taste of the power of the all formation illustration again!</p><p>As he refined his second body, the Golden mental energy fire between his eyebrows jumped. On the all formation picture, endless light shone. It was a large formation, a dense large formation.</p><p>The arrays lit up and countless terrible attacks flew out to attack Di Yi.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Di Yi held the Battle Sword in his hand. The sword Qi whistled and madly slashed out, destroying the attacks one after another.</p><p>However, the million array diagram had endless arrays and endless attacks. It seemed to be endless and kept attacking Di Yi.</p><p>Without a doubt, the all formation illustration was also an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Back then, Lian Cang’s cultivation was only at Lv 1 martial Royal realm, while Di Yi was at Lv 2 martial Royal realm. If it were not for the magic of the million formation illustration, how could Lian Cang have the chance to leave a trace of imprint and rush into the deep underground when Di Yi sneaked an attack on him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
