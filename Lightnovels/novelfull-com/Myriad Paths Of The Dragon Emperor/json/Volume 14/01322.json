His eyes were bright as he stared at Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s expression changed. Finally, he let out a long sigh and said, ” “Lu Ming, I didn’t want to tell you at first, but since your combat strength has already reached such a level, there’s no harm in telling you!”</p><p>the yin and yang formation of the talisman Amulet sect has been broken by Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s words were like thunder, ringing in Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>When Lu Ming returned, he heard a series of important news. Then, he heard that the Tianxia Academy was attacked. He immediately rushed to the Tianxia Academy and did not have time to ask about the talisman Amulet sect. He did not expect such an unforeseen event to happen.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s subconscious mind, the talisman Amulet sect could still hold on for a while. Therefore, Lu Ming did not ask much about it.</p><p>a few months ago, Martial Emperor Di Yi attacked. The first one was the myriad demon Valley, which was easily destroyed. The second one was the talisman sect.</p><p>although the talisman Amulet sect’s yin and yang formation was powerful and could block Di Yi alone, the yin and yang formation could not block Di Yi and the other two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts ‘attacks together with the king spiritual weapon. At that time, Bai Shijin, du songjue, master, and the others controlled the yin and yang formation in order to stall for time so that the others could move. In the end, most of the people moved to Northern Plains, but master, Bai Shijin, and the others fell into Di Yi’s hands!</p><p>Yan kuangtu explained in detail.</p><p>Most of the talisman Amulet sect’s disciples, Lu Ming’s parents, Hua Chi, and the others had all been transferred to the Northern Plains through the inter-territory teleportation array. However, the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the other higher-ups were in Di Yi’s hands.</p><p>general Lu, you don’t have to worry too much. Since Di Yi didn’t do anything at that time and kept them alive, I don’t think he will kill them so quickly!</p><p>Someone spoke and persuaded Lu Ming.</p><p>indeed. I didn’t kill them but kept them alive. They must be useful. They shouldn’t be in danger for the time being!</p><p>The others also advised.</p><p>At this moment, many people’s expressions changed, and a Jade voice transmission talisman appeared in their hands.</p><p>There must have been some important news, as some of the higher-ups had received the news at the same time.</p><p>They all sent their Holy senses to the Jade voice transmission talismans.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu saw the Jade talisman and exclaimed. He was too excited to suppress the Zhen Yuan in his body. A powerful aura burst out from his body, and a layer of burning flames spread out from his body, causing the temperature in the hall to rise sharply.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The others also began to roar in rage, their faces extremely unsightly, including Xie Luan and the other emperors.</p><p>“What is it? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and he had a bad feeling.</p><p>He had just returned, so naturally, no one had sent him any news.</p><p>“General Lu …”</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming, wanting to say something but stopped.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Yan kuangtu clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were red with anger. His body was trembling in anger.</p><p>“What’s going on? Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily. His eyes were like lightning, and his body emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>But everyone looked at each other, and still no one spoke.</p><p>“I’ll see for myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and pounced on one of the Supreme-beings. The Supreme-being could not resist at all and the voice transmission jade talisman in his hand was snatched away by Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming scanned the contents of the voice transmission jade talisman with his spiritual senses, his expression changed drastically. He became extremely ugly and a cold murderous intent burst out from his body.</p><p>Di Yi, Xie family!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out these words. They were so cold that they sent chills down one’s spine.</p><p>There was only one message in the Jade talisman.</p><p>Just now, the Xie clan and the Emperor heaven divine Palace of the ancient Saint dynasty had sent out a joint message. A month later, the Xie clan and the Emperor heaven divine Palace would hold an Alliance ceremony in the sacred city. At that time, they would kill the rebels, including Xia Jiuyang, Bai Shijin, and du songjue, and use their blood as a sacrifice.</p><p>The short message made Lu Ming’s killing intent reach its peak.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze fell on Lu Ming. Everyone knew that Lu Ming was the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect and had a close relationship with the nine suns Supreme. Lu Ming would definitely not sit by and do nothing.</p><p>Di Yi of the Xie family, in that case, kill him!</p><p>After uttering the last word, Lu Ming’s body burst with a strong fighting spirit. His gaze seemed to penetrate the void and look at the holy city hundreds of millions of miles away.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you want to go to the holy city? Don’t be impulsive. This must be a scheme of Di Yi and the Xie family. During the battle at the Tianxia Academy, Di Yi must have known your combat power. He was afraid of you, so he spread this news. His purpose is to lure you to the sacred city and then kill you. You can’t be fooled!”</p><p>Xie Luan hurriedly said.</p><p>“In that case, I’ll do as they wish. I’ll make a trip to the holy city in a month!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“You can’t, general Lu. With our current strength, we’re no match for the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie family!”</p><p>that’s right. Moreover, it’s in the holy city, which is even more dangerous!</p><p>The others persuaded Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>The holy city in a month’s time was undoubtedly a Dragon’s pool and a Tiger’s Den. It would be extremely dangerous to head there.</p><p>it’s not impossible to fight. I wanted to wait for a while to make more preparations, but since that’s the case, let’s bring forward the decisive battle!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold and his eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>He had to save nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others. Otherwise, what was the point of killing Di Yi and the others in the future?</p><p>At this moment, outside the Tianxia Academy’s Wanxiang Jade wall, the space suddenly rippled. Then, a figure stepped out of the space.</p><p>If someone saw this, they would definitely exclaim.</p><p>It was because he was Lu Ming. To be more precise, he was Lu Ming’s second body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s second body had received the inheritance of the mysterious sky Saint and had been cultivating the Dao of inscription. Now, Lu Ming had finally summoned it.</p><p>Di Yi, Xie family, let’s fight!</p><p>Lu Ming whispered, his eyes cold. He took a step forward and the space cracked automatically. He then disappeared.</p><p>Hundred beasts tribe, meeting hall!</p><p>“Bring forward the decisive battle? General Lu, you can’t do that. We’re not strong enough!”</p><p>Yes, we can’t stop Di Yi and the two Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts!</p><p>“General Lu, we need to plan this carefully!”</p><p>The others persuaded Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>Most importantly, Di Yi and the two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts both had King spiritual weapons. They were so powerful that ordinary Kings could only be killed by them.</p><p>How could it be blocked?</p><p>A month later, all these experts would definitely be present in the holy city. They were waiting for Lu Ming.</p><p>It would be unwise to fight a decisive battle with the other party at this moment.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand and the hall fell silent.</p><p>“Since I’m going, I’ll fight a battle that I’m confident in. Since I’m going to save people, how can I, Lu Ming, sacrifice your lives for nothing?”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. His glabella lit up and a figure appeared beside him, exuding a vast aura.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
