Everyone looked at each other, but no one made a sound.</p><p>“What should we do next?”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang was the first to speak, Breaking the Silence.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>All sorts of thoughts flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>Now, the Emperor heaven divine Palace was destroyed, and the Xie clan suffered heavy losses. They had sealed themselves as imperial palaces for ten thousand years.</p><p>In the vast divine wilderness mainland, other than the Western Desert, it no longer had an owner. So, what should they do next?</p><p>In other words, how should they be distributed?</p><p>In this boundless territory, there were endless resources. Everyone wanted them.</p><p>At a smaller scale, there were still some former Overlord forces present, such as Tianxia Academy and the floating mountain.</p><p>How should these forces distribute their territories?</p><p>On a larger scale, it would be the heaven suppressing divine Army and the forces of Northern Plains, how would they get along and how would they be distributed?</p><p>In fact, in Northern Plains, there were two forces, Lu Ming and Xie Luan, but they were only in an Alliance.</p><p>Everyone fell silent again, especially the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>This was an important problem. If it was not resolved properly, it might lead to another huge battle.</p><p>However, the heaven suppressing divine Army was no match for Lu Ming and the others. If they were to fight, they would only be destroyed.</p><p>Therefore, the powerhouses of the heaven suppressing divine Army had the most complicated feelings, and they found it difficult to speak.</p><p>Two tigers can’t share a mountain. Would Lu Ming and Xie Luan be targeted next?</p><p>In their hearts, they were not confident.</p><p>“How about we form an alliance?”</p><p>After a long time, Xie Luan spoke.</p><p>“Alliance?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled as they pondered.</p><p>let’s form an alliance. All the factions will form one faction. Then, the entire divine wilderness will be under our control. Why would we need to worry about territory and territory!</p><p>Xie Luan smiled.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>In the beginning, it was qu Luo, Mo Ye, and the others. Later on, Xia Jiuyang, the Barbarian Emperor, the moon Heart Martial Emperor, and the others all spoke one after another, expressing their approval.</p><p>“Haha, chaotic sky Emperor’s suggestion is good. This old man also agrees!”</p><p>The old general of the heaven suppressing divine Army laughed and expressed his thoughts.</p><p>In the end, all eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had yet to speak.</p><p>“I also have no objections!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, then it’s decided!”</p><p>Xie Luan smiled.</p><p>since we’re in an Alliance, we need an Alliance leader. Who’s the alliance leader? ”</p><p>Suddenly, an Emperor spoke, and the scene fell silent again.</p><p>Who would be the alliance leader?</p><p>Forming an alliance and forming a faction, there was no doubt that the alliance leader was the leader of this faction. He was also the master of the divine wilderness, ruling the world.</p><p>The crowd could not help but look at the old general, Xie Luan, and Lu Ming.</p><p>At the scene, only these three people were the most qualified.</p><p>the alliance leader’s person, of course, it’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming is young and his combat strength is unparalleled. There has never been anyone like him in the divine wilderness since ancient times. Who else can it be other than him? ”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang was the first to speak, recommending Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right. If not for Lu Ming, we wouldn’t be in this situation. It’s Lu Ming who turned the tide and created this situation. I also recommend Lu Ming to be the alliance leader!”</p><p>One of the deans of the Tianxia Academy continued.</p><p>“I recommend Lu Ming too!”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Then, another Dean of the Tianxia Academy, the Barbarian Emperor and Martial Emperor Yuexin, recommended Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, the heaven suppressing divine ape and tu Qian were exuding auras that were even more obvious.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. Unknowingly, the forces and abilities that Lu Ming controlled had already become so shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a glass of wine and sipped slowly. He did not say a word and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>The emperors of the heaven suppressing divine Army, Mo Ye, qu Luo, and the others were all calculating something in their minds.</p><p>haha, that’s right. I’m also interested in recommending Lu Ming as the alliance leader!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed heartily as he expressed his thoughts.</p><p>As soon as Xie Luan spoke, Mo Ye, qu Luo, and the others also spoke up in support of Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, only the heaven suppressing divine Army was left.</p><p>The Emperor of the heaven suppressing divine Army sighed in his heart. He knew that they were weak and could not compete with Lu Ming. Now that Xie Luan was supporting Lu Ming, how could they say no?</p><p>“Old general, what do you think?”</p><p>Xie Luan looked at the old general with a faint smile.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, your talent is unprecedented and you have made the greatest contribution this time. It is the divine wilderness continent’s fortune for Lu Ming to be the alliance leader. I have no objections.</p><p>The old general said.</p><p>As the old general spoke, the warring Martial Emperor and the others also recommended Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, then it’s decided. This subordinate pays his respects to the Alliance master!</p><p>Xie Luan suddenly got up from his seat and walked down to bow to Lu Ming.</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the Alliance master!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang, the Barbarian Emperor, and the others followed closely behind Xie Luan and bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, quluo and the rest also bowed to Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>Finally, it was the heaven suppressing divine Army and others.</p><p>“Alright, since the Army holds it in such high regard, Lu Ming will take up the responsibility!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and accepted the position of Alliance leader.</p><p>He didn’t decline, and there was no need to decline. He needed this identity to better protect his family and friends.</p><p>“Alliance master, since we want to form an alliance, what should we call it?”</p><p>Someone suggested.</p><p>Alliance master has awakened the bloodline of the nine Dragons and is famous throughout the world. In my opinion, why don’t we call it the Dragon Alliance? ”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang said after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Dragon Alliance? I think it’s possible. It’s concise and domineering!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll call it the Dragon Alliance!”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming decided.</p><p>Now that the name had been chosen, the problem was, where would the headquarters of the Dragon Alliance be?</p><p>It can’t be set in the holy city, right?</p><p>Eastern barren, Northern Plains, and Southern nether were not good.</p><p>The Dragon Alliance was bound to sweep across the world and unify the divine wilderness. Their headquarters should be in the central continent. Only then would they be able to look down on the world and shock the world.</p><p>In the end, they decided that since the Dragon Alliance was going to be built, it would be best to build a new headquarters too.</p><p>After some discussion, they decided to select disciples on the vast land of the central continent. In the end, they decided to build the headquarters of the Dragon Alliance on mount long Yue, about three hundred million li away, East of the holy city.</p><p>It was called the Imperial Dragon City!</p><p>After the alliance leader and name were decided by the headquarters, they began to select the important leaders.</p><p>Finally, Xie Luan and the old general of the heaven suppressing divine Army were the Deputy chiefs of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>The other emperors would protect the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Each protector could manage a territory.</p><p>After the leader was set, they were assigned their respective tasks.</p><p>There were two main tasks at hand.</p><p>The first was to dispatch manpower to build the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>The second was to send an Army to truly unify the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The Xie family had sealed themselves and the Emperor sky divine Palace had been destroyed. The Overlord forces that truly had an Emperor were almost all from the Dragon Alliance. However, there were still countless other forces, big and small, below the Overlord forces.</p><p>All of these powers had to be in the hands of the Dragon Alliance. The entire divine wilderness continent had to be in their hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
