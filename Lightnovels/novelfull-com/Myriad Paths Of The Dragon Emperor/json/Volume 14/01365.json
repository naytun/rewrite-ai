However, the space-breaking shuttle had disappeared.</p><p>“It’s another Emperor spiritual weapon, and it’s the escape type!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and felt that it was a pity.</p><p>The other party was too rich and had all kinds of Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>First, there were offensive types, then there were defensive types, and now, there were even escape types.</p><p>Under the control of the silver-haired old man, the space-breaking shuttle was so fast that it disappeared in an instant. It was much faster than tearing the void.</p><p>Di Xian had escaped. Lu Ming turned his gaze to other directions.</p><p>Di Yi, where are you going? ”</p><p>Lu Ming transformed back into his human form, a cold smile on his lips.</p><p>At this time, Di Yi was desperately fleeing.</p><p>Di Yi’s face was full of fear and disbelief.</p><p>It was only a difference of a few months, but Lu Ming’s combat strength had once again increased by a large margin. Without the help of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he was able to kill a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Di Yi roared in his heart, extremely unwilling, and fled for his life at the same time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Di Yi’s pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s clone that appeared in front of Di Yi.</p><p>Di Yi, you can’t burn your spirit body this time. Do you think you can still escape? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice came from behind Di Yi.</p><p>Behind him was the main body.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Di Yi was very decisive and attacked directly.</p><p>However, his cultivation had regressed to the peak of the LV 1 martial Royal realm and his myriad spiritual meridians body had been destroyed. His combat strength was far inferior to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>He waved his hand and the all array diagram appeared, trapping Di Yi in it.</p><p>Di Yi, I’ll kill you later!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and charged toward the battlefield where Xie Luan and the others were.</p><p>The five peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts were almost scared out of their wits. They wanted to escape, but Xie Luan and the others kept them busy.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held the Dragon vein sword and slashed five times, one at a time. Five peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts were killed in the air.</p><p>Everyone in the Imperial Dragon City was stunned as they looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>The five peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts killed five people with five slashes.</p><p>This visual effect and impact were too strong.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, a peak second level martial Royal realm expert would be one of the strongest. But in Lu Ming’s hands, he was as weak as a chicken.</p><p>“The Alliance master is invincible!”</p><p>“Alliance master is unparalleled!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a deafening roar burst out in the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>Countless people were so excited that their faces turned red and they roared madly. At this moment, Lu Ming’s figure was irreplaceable in their hearts. He was indomitable and unrivaled.</p><p>The whistling sound came wave after wave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s prestige had reached its peak.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand and pressed down on the air. The Imperial Dragon City quieted down at once.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved his body and appeared in front of Di Yi.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you know what kind of people we are? Do you know who di Xian gongzi is? I’m telling you, we are from the yuan continent, the DI family, one of the major clans of the yuan continent. If you dare to kill a member of the DI family, you are dead meat. Young master di Xian will not let you off. The entire divine wilderness continent will be buried with you!”</p><p>Di Yi roared.</p><p>“A big sect in the yuanlu continent? The DI family?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He had long guessed that Di Yi, di Xian, and the others had extraordinary origins. He did not expect them to be a big force in the yuan continent.</p><p>The pupils of Xie Luan, the old general, and the others contracted, and they gasped.</p><p>A big sect in yuanlu. Di Yi actually came from yuanlu.</p><p>That was the yuan continent. It was not something the divine wilderness continent or the divine Ruins could compare to.</p><p>Legend had it that in the yuan continent, experts were as common as clouds and as common as rain. There were countless existences that had surpassed the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>An expert of that level could destroy the divine wilderness continent with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Everyone who had heard of the rumors in the yuan continent was worried.</p><p>Seeing this, Di Yi sneered and said, ” “Lu Ming, you’d better let me go. Maybe I can help you …”</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke!”</p><p>Before Di Yi could finish his sentence, Lu Ming laughed and interrupted him.</p><p>Di Yi, you used to be a Lord of a region. Now, in order to survive, you are using this to scare me. It’s really pitiful and sad!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>Di Yi was furious.</p><p>Di Yi, I’m telling you, you must die today. And that di Xian, if he stops here, it’s fine. But if he is stubborn, the Emperor family of yuanlu will be destroyed together!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his voice rumbling throughout the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>At most, the yuanlu Emperor family would be wiped out!</p><p>What kind of heroic spirit was this? How confident was he?</p><p>Di Yi was stunned, and then laughed wildly.”Lu Ming, you’re the one who wants to destroy the DI family. You’re so short-sighted, you’re just a frog at the bottom of a well!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you know how many experts there are in the yuan continent? Do you know how powerful the DI family is? How dare you claim that you’ve annihilated the DI family? if your words were to spread to Yuan continent, I don’t know how many people would laugh their teeth off!”</p><p>Di Yi laughed, as if he did not care about life and death.</p><p>“So what if I’m strong? Back then, I came from a small country in the mysterious region of the eastern barren territory. At that time, the Emperor heaven divine Palace was also a giant, and you, Di Yi, were also high and mighty. But how are you now?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his eyes full of confidence.</p><p>Di Yi shut up.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Di Yi, haven’t you always wanted the nine dragon blood essence? Today, I’ll let you die under the bloodline of the nine Dragons!”</p><p>With that, the nine Dragon bloodline opened its mouth, and the devouring power enveloped Di Yi.</p><p>Ever since his nine Dragon bloodline had fused with the nine drops of nine dragon blood essence, his devouring power had been enhanced many times. It was shockingly powerful.</p><p>Enveloped by the devouring power, Di Yi’s life essence, heart blood, and essence blood were quickly lost and devoured by the nine Dragons.</p><p>Di Yi, even though he was the Overlord of a generation and had a tough mind, he was ready to be killed. But in the face of such a situation, he still screamed in horror and struggled with all his might.</p><p>However, in the million formation illustration, it was futile to struggle.</p><p>A moment later, Di Yi’s life essence was completely devoured and he turned into a dry corpse.</p><p>In the Imperial Dragon City, countless people were looking at the sky with complicated expressions.</p><p>Di Yi was also considered an Overlord of his generation. He had planned for ten thousand years and had almost unified the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>If not for the appearance of an unprecedented genius like Lu Ming, Di Yi would have succeeded and unified the divine wilderness.</p><p>Di Yi was known as a hero of his generation. However, in the end, he died at the hands of Lu Ming. He had completely fallen.</p><p>“Let the Alliance establishment ceremony continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around, stepped down, and flew down the Imperial Dragon City. His voice spread throughout the city.</p><p>“The Alliance master is invincible!”</p><p>Their shouts reverberated through the clouds.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming’s prestige had reached its peak.</p><p>As for yuanlu, only a small number of people knew about it. Most people did not even have the concept of yuanlu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
