I suggest that each of the four divine palaces send a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert. The four of us will join forces to test this kid’s strength. If he didn’t set up a killing formation here, we can take him down in one fell swoop!</p><p>...</p><p>A white-haired old man from the North God Palace said.</p><p>This person was the palace Master of the North God Palace. His cultivation had reached the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm and he was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The others all nodded in agreement.</p><p>Next, it was time to select the candidates.</p><p>Soon, the four divine palaces each selected a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>In the North divine Palace, Wang Sheng had just surrendered, so his status was the lowest. Without a doubt, the North divine Palace wanted him to take action, which made his expression somewhat unsightly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>From four directions, the four overlords were like four gods, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no matter what tricks you have up your sleeve, the outcome is already decided today!”</p><p>Wang Sheng sneered. Step by step, his aura became stronger and stronger. His entire body was covered in a milky white holy light!</p><p>He was the strongest among the four.</p><p>He used to be one of the patriarchs of the top 10 families in the South God Palace. He was ranked in the top three among the patriarchs of the top 10 families in the South God Palace. His cultivation had almost reached the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and clone stood together. He covered his entire body with the embryonic form of the chaos Domain to resist the external pressure.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under the pressure of the four experts, the lake water below churned. The lake water within a hundred thousand miles was instantly evaporated, revealing the dried-up bottom of the lake.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Suddenly, Wang Sheng shouted explosively and took the lead to attack.</p><p>The other three experts also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted softly.</p><p>Then, the bubble appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder. It chirped and waved its small claws.</p><p>On the bodies of Wang Sheng and the other three, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared, enveloping the four people inside.</p><p>The four of them were frozen in the air, unable to move.</p><p>The four of them were sealed in the bubble, their eyes revealing an expression of shock and despair.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and charged at one of them with the Dragon vein sword in his hand.</p><p>The combat sword slashed and the man was cut in half. His spiritual God was also crushed into pieces by the sword Qi.</p><p>An Overlord at the LV 4 martial Royal realm was killed just like that.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>All around, everyone was stunned, not understanding what had happened.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he charged at the second person.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The second Overlord figure was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming charged towards the third person, Wang Sheng!</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, what’s going on? Break, break!”</p><p>Wang Sheng roared crazily, using all his strength, wanting to blast open the transparent bubble.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to approach him, he finally burst the transparent bubble.</p><p>However, what made him despair was that just as he broke this transparent bubble, another transparent bubble appeared out of thin air and enveloped him.</p><p>This transparent bubble had appeared without any warning. There were no fluctuations and it was impossible to Dodge.</p><p>“No, no, don’t …”</p><p>Wang Sheng’s heart was madly roaring, frantically struggling.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Battle Sword slashed down, splitting Wang Sheng into two, destroying his body and soul.</p><p>After killing Wang Sheng, Lu Ming didn’t even look and charged towards the fourth person.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>that’s the space-time domain! It’s the space-time domain!</p><p>“It’s that pet! It’s that pet! This person is a monster! A monster!”</p><p>let’s attack together and kill him. We’d rather not get the mixed energy token!</p><p>Lu Ming had killed three overlord figures in a row. The experts of the four divine palaces were completely terrified and went completely crazy.</p><p>Lu Ming was too dangerous. If they did not kill him today, they would be the ones to die.</p><p>“Attack, all of you attack!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Hundreds of experts from the divine palaces all attacked at the same time. Hundreds of attacks gathered together and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This kind of attack was too terrifying. Heaven and earth trembled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted rapidly.</p><p>There was no doubt that if Lu Ming was hit, he would definitely turn into ashes. There was no possibility of him surviving.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble’s body glowed and its small claw clawed at the void. A space-time Tunnel appeared and Lu Ming rushed into it without any hesitation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The attack landed on the ground the moment Lu Ming rushed into the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>Below him, the lake that was hundreds of thousands of miles in radius was instantly annihilated.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground within a radius of several hundred thousand li was shaking violently, and countless huge cracks covered the entire land like a spider web.</p><p>At the center of the attack, a huge hole with a radius of tens of thousands of miles appeared. Its depth was unfathomable.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the next moment, fiery red lava rushed out of the giant hole and rushed thousands of miles into the sky.</p><p>Without a doubt, the ground had been pierced through. It was like the end of the world for hundreds of thousands of miles. Countless creatures had died.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, the space fluctuated and Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming did not die!”</p><p>“He’s there!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The experts charged at Lu Ming the moment they saw him.</p><p>Beams of dazzling rainbow light streaked across the sky and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>“If you want to kill, then kill to your heart’s content today!”</p><p>The energy of the air-frozen bead gushed into Lu Ming’s body. He cast the wind elemental art and his body moved rapidly, avoiding the attacks and killing his way into the crowd.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble cried out. A Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert was the first to bear the brunt. He was enveloped by the transparent bubble and could not move at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward and killed the man.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged forward and killed a few martial emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body was bathed in Emperor’s blood. He was like an invincible god of death.</p><p>help each other. Whoever is trapped by those bubbles, help each other!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Then, some people were trapped by bubbles. The other strong people quickly came to their aid, leaving Lu Ming with no way to attack.</p><p>“This move of his is useless, kill!”</p><p>“Lu Ming must die today!”</p><p>The crowd roared and charged at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>“It’s my turn to make a move!”</p><p>He appeared and flew out. Suddenly, a huge turtle shell appeared in the air. Many attacks landed on the huge turtle shell, but they were all blocked by it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bubbles opened her mouth and spat out a few sharp glints. These glints were like wind blades, but they were many times stronger than wind blades. They were the condensation of space and time.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert was killed by the sword radiance.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted as her body rapidly grew in size. She slapped a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert to death.</p><p>After dandan and bubbles broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, they displayed terrifying combat strength and could even kill a Lv 4 Martial Emperor.</p><p>This made the experts from all four sides feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p>However, there were too many experts in the surroundings. Although dandan and bubbles had each killed one person, they were also blasted away by the many attacks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
