He was ranked third among the emperors of the southern underworld and was extremely powerful.</p><p>When the third underworld Emperor made his move, the head of the Wang family was ecstatic. He secretly rejoiced, thinking that he was saved.</p><p>the third emperor of the dead, this man is someone His Majesty Di Yi wants to take down. Hurry up and kill him. His Majesty will definitely reward you heavily!</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan shouted.</p><p>you’re so young, but you already have such combat strength. It’s rare since ancient times. Unfortunately, you don’t know how to keep a low profile and actually came here. I’ll send you on your way, hehe!</p><p>The third underworld Emperor laughed. His voice was dry and unpleasant, like a skeleton.</p><p>He was covered in a large black robe and looked like a piece of black cloth floating in the air.</p><p>“Netherworld domain, transform into my netherworld Qi!”</p><p>The third emperor of the dead grinned hideously. A black domain spread out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The speed of the domain was extremely fast. The moment it appeared, it covered a radius of a hundred miles.</p><p>Lu Ming was also enveloped by it. Instantly, he felt countless black shadows Pouncing on him. Endless netherworld Qi drilled into Lu Ming’s skin, trying to corrode him and turn him into netherworld Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, a black saber appeared in the third underworld Emperor’s Hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>In his own territory, the third underworld Emperor’s speed was extremely fast. The moment he slashed out, he was in front of Lu Ming immediately.</p><p>“Wind elemental technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He cast the wind elemental technique. His body moved without any wind. With a light sway, he dodged the third underworld Emperor’s attack.</p><p>At the same time, he threw a punch.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The fist force hit the saber’s side, making a loud boom. The third underworld Emperor’s body trembled, and he couldn’t help but take two steps back.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he also took a few steps back.</p><p>“Such a powerful force?”</p><p>The third hell-Emperor was shocked.</p><p>“Netherworld body!”</p><p>The third emperor of the dead’s body trembled. His entire body collapsed and turned into a ball of netherworld Qi. Together with his netherworld domain, it enveloped the entire world.</p><p>Within a hundred-mile radius, the netherworld domain covered the entire area with netherworld Qi.</p><p>A spirit body was formed from the bloodline and had some of the characteristics of the bloodline. Different spirit bodies had different mysteries and effects.</p><p>Some spirit bodies leaned towards attack, some leaned towards defense, and some leaned towards speed.</p><p>For example, the spirit body of the third underworld Emperor could turn into the Qi of the netherworld and attack.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming was enveloped in the netherworld Qi. The sound of air being cut rang out in the surroundings. Countless saber lights were slashing toward Lu Ming from unknown directions.</p><p>“Fire elemental technique, Thunder elemental technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He transformed his chaos concept into the fire and Thunder concepts. A long spear condensed from flames appeared in his right hand, and a long spear condensed from lightning appeared in his left hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The flaming long spear swept out in all directions with the power to sweep away thousands of troops.</p><p>Fire and lightning were the nemesis of the netherworld Qi. Moreover, the fire and lightning were condensed by the fire origin technique and the Thunder origin technique. The power of the two intents was exerted to the extreme, and the power was even more shocking.</p><p>The flaming spear swept across and the netherworld Qi exploded. The saber gleams that were slashing at Lu Ming collapsed one by one. Even the netherworld domain shook violently as if it would explode at any moment.</p><p>“It’s over there …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were fixed on the front. The lightning Spear in his left hand shot out like lightning.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A blood-curdling scream came from that place. Then, the third hell-Emperor appeared and retreated rapidly. There was a hole in his shoulder, and lightning was flashing through it.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The Masters of the Wang and Jiang families widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>The third emperor of the dead was injured. One of the emperors was injured by Lu Ming.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming could even injure an Emperor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element art. His body swayed as he approached the third emperor of the dead at high speed and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was a fusion of the earth origin technique, fire origin technique, and Thunder origin technique.</p><p>The third emperor of the dead’s domain shook violently. It only lasted for one breath before it exploded. The three martial techniques hit the third emperor of the dead, and he screamed as he was sent flying. Half of his body exploded, and his aura became weak.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>There was only one thought in the head of the Wang family, and that was to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming was too freakish. He was so young, but his combat strength was unimaginably strong. Even the third underworld Emperor was no match for him. After exchanging a few blows, he was beaten half to death. If he did not escape, he would die.</p><p>“Wang Shengtian, I’ve said it. You will die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He activated the wind element technique and caught up with the master of the Wang family in a few flashes.</p><p>“No, spare me …”</p><p>As death descended upon him, the head of the Wang family broke down. He began to beg bitterly. Supreme martial artist? face? he didn’t want any of that. Compared to his life, these were nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the master of the Wang family coldly. There was not a trace of pity in his eyes.</p><p>Once upon a time, the master of the Wang family was an unparalleled existence in Lu Ming’s eyes. He was a Supreme Being who could kill him with one finger.</p><p>However, things had changed with the passage of time. Right now, the Wang clan’s clan leader was nothing in front of him and could be easily killed by him.</p><p>The world was unpredictable, who could predict it?</p><p>Lu Ming was growing and growing rapidly. Without realizing it, Lu Ming had become a peak figure in the divine wilderness continent. Those existences that he had to look up to in the past now looked up to him.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>An indifferent voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. His palm was like a knife, and he struck out.</p><p>“No, if I die, you’ll die too!”</p><p>The Wang clan’s clan leader roared in anger. He knew that he was going to die. Ruthlessness flashed in his eyes, and the aura on his body became violent. He was going to self-destruct.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>shut up! Lu Ming shouted coldly. He exerted force in his palm and a Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele flashed, pressing down on the master of the Wang family.</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family didn’t even have time to scream before he was crushed into pieces and died on the spot.</p><p>He could not even self-destruct in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the master of the Jiang family and the master of the Luan family.</p><p>Back then, during the battle of ninedragons, the Masters of the six great ancient families had all attacked Lu Ming. Among them, the Masters of the Jiang family, the Luan family, and the Wang family had all wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had always kept this grudge in his heart. Today, he would kill them all.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The Masters of the Jiang family and the Luan family desperately flew up into the sky, because there was an Emperor there.</p><p>However, how fast was Lu Ming’s speed? He took a step forward and appeared behind them. Circulating the prison suppressing heavenly art, he struck out two palm strikes in a row. The two clan heads were dead!</p><p>“The third hell-Emperor!”</p><p>After killing the two clan heads, Lu Ming set his eyes on the third underworld Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
