Why did they sound the drum and gather everyone?</p><p>...</p><p>“Everyone’s here!”</p><p>One of the young men looked at the crowd and said indifferently, ”</p><p>No one made a sound.</p><p>alright, I believe you’ve heard about the news of entering the great Emperor’s Secret realm in three months!</p><p>The young man continued, the corners of his mouth rising with cold arrogance, ” let me tell you, this is the good fortune that you have accumulated over several lifetimes. If it weren’t for this reason, you would never have been able to join Dragon God Valley in your lifetime, let alone enter the great emperor secret realm. So, you must seize the opportunity, understand? ”</p><p>The young man’s voice reverberated throughout the valley, but everyone could hear the disdain in his voice.</p><p>It was like a Prince looking down at a group of beggars!</p><p>Many people frowned but did not say anything. From their tone, these people should be locals and not from a continent outside of Yuan continent.</p><p>Since he was from the yuan continent, no one knew if he was related to the higher-ups of Dragon God Valley. Naturally, no one refuted the young man.</p><p>alright, let’s get to the point. The man in front of you is the peerless genius of Dragon God Valley, young master yinfeng. Why don’t you pay your respects to him? ”</p><p>The young man pointed to a young man in the middle.</p><p>Among the three young men, the leader was the one in the middle. He looked to be in his early twenties and was dressed in silver. He had a cold and arrogant expression as he looked at Lu Ming and the others with a faint disdain.</p><p>“Greetings, young master yinfeng!”</p><p>There were a few people who cupped their fists.</p><p>“Hmph, what kind of attitude is this? Young master Yin Feng is also going to enter the great emperor secret realm this time. I’ll give you a chance to join him and become his subordinates. You’ll enter the great emperor secret realm and listen to his orders. In the future, when you’re in the Dragon God Valley, young master Yin Feng will naturally take care of you!”</p><p>The young man spoke, finally revealing their true purpose.</p><p>They actually wanted Lu Ming and the rest to join young master yinfeng and become his subordinates.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The great emperor secret realm was a place of great fortune. Naturally, it would not only be for outsiders like them. The local talents of the major sects would definitely enter as well.</p><p>Yin Feng and the other two seemed to be at the Supreme level, so they would definitely enter.</p><p>They had a good idea. Now, they would gather Lu Ming and the others in their hands. When they entered the great emperor secret realm, they would use them to gain benefits for themselves.</p><p>This was something that everyone present could figure out with just a little thought.</p><p>I’m sorry, I’m used to being a loner. I don’t have any thoughts of becoming someone else’s subordinate. Goodbye!</p><p>A bald young man said coldly and was about to return to his cave.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, the young man who had spoken appeared in front of the bald young man.</p><p>“You want to refuse?”</p><p>The local youth said coldly.</p><p>“I don’t have the habit of being someone else’s dog!”</p><p>The bald young man sneered. He was implying that the other party was just a dog of yinfeng.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The local youth’s face turned completely dark, and a cold killing intent spread out. it’s already a blessing that you’ve cultivated for eight lifetimes for a lowly ant from a Savage Island to be able to join Dragon God Valley. You don’t know how to bow your head in gratitude, and you dare to be arrogant in front of me, Yin feizhang. It seems that you’ll forget who you are if I don’t teach you a lesson!</p><p>The Native Young man was called silver flying badge, and he emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“I’m not afraid of you!”</p><p>The bald youth’s aura also bloomed. He was also at the Supreme-being level.</p><p>These young men were all at the peak of their respective continents. They were invincible among their peers and looked down on others.</p><p>All of them were proud and arrogant, so how could they be willing to become someone else’s subordinate?</p><p>At the same time, silver flying badge was also a Supreme martial artist. Why would he be afraid of a fight at the same level?</p><p>hehe, then I’ll let you know how weak you, the lowly trash of a Savage Island, are. Come on, I’ll let you have three moves!</p><p>Silver flying badge said coldly.</p><p>“There’s no need for you to let me win. I’ll defeat you in ten moves!”</p><p>The bald youth shouted. He was also an extremely proud person.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bald youth’s body emitted a yellow halo, which was his domain.</p><p>The embryonic form of the domain enveloped the silver flying badge.</p><p>a small trick. Since you don’t know your own strength, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>The silver flying badge stepped forward, and a domain also appeared on his body.</p><p>The two domains met in the air.</p><p>However, an unexpected scene occurred. The moment the two of them touched each other, the bald youth’s domain collapsed.</p><p>The bald youth’s expression changed greatly, and he retreated a few steps.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the silver flying badge moved. In an instant, it appeared in front of the bald young man and slapped at him.</p><p>The bald young man’s face was solemn. He exhaled and also struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the two palms met, the bald young man’s expression changed drastically. His body was knocked back continuously, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You … How could that be?”</p><p>The bald young man looked at Yin feizhang in disbelief.</p><p>They were both zhizun realm experts, yet he couldn’t even withstand a single strike from the other party. How was this possible?</p><p>His self-confidence had taken a heavy blow.</p><p>The other young men were all shocked.</p><p>It wasn’t that the bald youth wasn’t strong, but that the silver flying badge was too strong.</p><p>domain martial technique!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a few words.</p><p>He possessed a portion of the nine Dragons ‘memories, so he was naturally very knowledgeable. With a single glance, he could tell that the silver flying badge was using a domain-level martial technique.</p><p>A domain martial technique could unleash the power of a domain to the extreme.</p><p>Furthermore, domain martial arts techniques were very precious. Even in the major sects of the yuanlu, not everyone could practice them.</p><p>Martial arts techniques of creation existed in some small continents.</p><p>However, it was impossible for those small continents to have domain martial techniques.</p><p>Just now, the silver flying badge had used a combat domain martial technique to defeat the bald youth in one move.</p><p>“Now do you know how trashy you are? Did he really think that he was an expert? Let me tell you, the reason why Dragon God Valley gathered you here is not because of your strength, but because your cultivation is too weak!”</p><p>in Dragon God Valley, there are many heaven’s favorites who are already at the Martial Emperor realm. They can not enter the great emperor secret realm. There are too few people below the Martial Emperor realm. That’s why I’ve come to your remote village to gather you. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Silver flying badge said coldly.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley accepted them as disciples and called them here, not because of their strength or talent, but because there were not many ‘weak’ talents in the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>This was a great irony for the top heaven’s favorites from the various continents.</p><p>Especially the bald youth, whose face was ashen.</p><p>if any of you don’t agree, I don’t mind crippling him and throwing him out. After all, you’re not the only disciples recruited from overseas this time. It doesn’t matter if I cripple a few!</p><p>Silver flying badge’s voice was getting colder and colder, which made many people’s faces turn ugly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
