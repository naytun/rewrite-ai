With a single move, a large number of experts were killed, and large numbers of corpses fell from the sky.</p><p>...</p><p>“Now, kill our way out!”</p><p>In the White jade Palace of the Tianxia Academy, an Emperor gave the order.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The cultivators from the Tianxia Academy also rushed out and surrounded the Army of the Ditian divine Palace.</p><p>“Ah, not good, run!”</p><p>“Quickly run!”</p><p>The great army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was defeated in an instant and fled for their lives.</p><p>They had no choice. The emperors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace were being held back. The Tianxia Academy, Mo Ye, and the others were all emperors. Killing those below the Emperor realm was as easy as killing chickens. Even Supremes would die with a single slap.</p><p>Chaos. The Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was in complete chaos. They only cared about fleeing for their lives.</p><p>Some Supreme martial artists didn’t have the heart to continue fighting and were fleeing frantically.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Tianxia Academy had been keeping an eye on these Supremes, and they had been killed one by one.</p><p>This was a one-sided massacre. Blood Qi filled the air, and the battle didn’t last long. More than half of the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had been killed, and the ground below was covered with corpses.</p><p>Those who had escaped were those with weak cultivation. No one was interested in killing them. Those with weak cultivation would not affect the overall situation much.</p><p>There were only three battlefields left in the sky above the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>Xie Luan fought di hongcheng.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor was up against the mountain breaker Martial Emperor, while qu Luo was up against the third underworld Emperor.</p><p>let’s end this quickly. Let’s attack together!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out as he charged at the third underworld Emperor.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s power of Blood Meridian had been exhausted and he could not perform the blood Meridian fusion, the power of the chaos will that Lu Ming had cast was still terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming approached the third emperor of the dead and threw a punch.</p><p>This punch carried the will of chaos and crushed the universe.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The third emperor of the dead felt a fatal danger. He roared in fear and turned into the Qi of the netherworld, trying to escape.</p><p>But under the chaos will, everything was futile.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s fist landed, the third emperor of the dead let out a blood-curdling screech. The netherworld Qi was obliterated, and the third emperor of the dead’s body reappeared. However, it was already in pieces. His spiritual God had also vanished into thin air under the impact of the punch.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Quluo and the other emperors gasped in horror.</p><p>An ordinary first level martial Royal realm expert was so weak when facing Lu Ming that he was killed by a single punch.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The mountain-breaking Martial Emperor was almost scared to death at the sight of this, and he charged forward madly.</p><p>However, the Barbarian Emperor blocked his way. Other than the Barbarian Emperor, Mo Ye, Yan kuangtu, and the others had also made their moves, leaving the mountain breaker Martial Emperor with no way out.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed the third underworld Emperor, he walked toward the mountain breaker Martial Emperor.</p><p>The mountain breaker Martial Emperor was extremely frightened.</p><p>“Di hongcheng, save me!”</p><p>Martial Emperor mountain breaker yelled to di hongcheng for help.</p><p>However, di hongcheng couldn’t free himself from the battle with Xie Luan, so he could only protect himself.</p><p>Xie Luan had been at the third level of the martial Royal realm at his peak. However, he had been suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele for 30000 years and his essence had been injured, so he could not recover to his peak. However, he had rich combat experience. Although his realm was the same as di hongcheng’s, he was still more powerful than di hongcheng.</p><p>Di hongcheng could only protect himself. He couldn’t free his divine body to save the mountain breaker Martial Emperor.</p><p>“If you dare to go against our di family, you will all die!”</p><p>In the end, di hongcheng roared and exchanged a blow with Xie Luan. Then, he turned into a sword light and shot away. He had actually escaped.</p><p>Xie Luan didn’t pursue him. Although he was slightly stronger than di hongcheng, there was a limit to his strength. He couldn’t keep di hongcheng here.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Seeing di hongcheng running away, Martial Emperor mountain breaker shouted in despair.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was already not far away from the mountain breaker Martial Emperor, and his cold killing intent enveloped him.</p><p>“Don’t kill me! I surrender! I surrender!”</p><p>The mountain-breaking Martial Emperor shouted.</p><p>He had seen the third underworld Emperor’s fate clearly. If he didn’t surrender, he would die.</p><p>“We can surrender, but give up resisting and let us seal our cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming did not necessarily have to kill the other party. After all, the other party was a martial Royal realm expert. If they surrendered and helped them, it would be beneficial to them.</p><p>Faced with such a situation, the mountain breaker Martial Emperor was helpless and could only give up on resisting.</p><p>He understood that even if he resisted with all his might, he would only be killed in the end. He might as well trust Lu Ming this once.</p><p>“Seal his cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming ordered.</p><p>Immediately, the Barbarian Emperor, qu Luo, and Mo Ye joined forces to seal the mountain breaker Martial Emperor’s cultivation base.</p><p>The battle had finally come to an end.</p><p>It ended with the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s defeat. Almost all the experts that were sent here had died in battle.</p><p>Only di hongcheng had escaped, the third underworld Emperor had died in battle, and the mountain breaker Martial Emperor had surrendered. They had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>The two deans of the Tianxia Academy came to Lu Ming and cupped their fists to thank him.</p><p>you’re too kind, Deans. Brother Kong Xin and I are friends. How can Lu Ming sit by and do nothing when the Tianxia Academy is in trouble? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu … Brother Lu!”</p><p>Kong Xin and goddess Tan Xiang came together and saluted Lu Ming. They had mixed feelings.</p><p>He still remembered that not long after the battle of Providence had ended, Lu Ming had changed his name to Lu Shaoqing and arrived in the central continent.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming’s combat strength was only about the same as theirs. In fact, his cultivation level was not even as high as theirs.</p><p>However, it had only been a few years, and there were already earth-shattering changes. Lu Ming’s cultivation level and combat strength had far surpassed them. He stood at the peak of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>They might not be able to catch up to Lu Ming even if they spent their entire lives.</p><p>“Brother Kong, fairy, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Then, he looked at the two deans of the Tianxia Academy and said, ” “My two courtyards, the world is in chaos now. What are you planning to do?”</p><p>“This … Sigh, we haven’t thought it through yet!”</p><p>A director with a tall figure sighed.</p><p>In Tianxia Academy, there were those who cultivated the martial path and those who cultivated the inscription path. Of the two deans, one cultivated the martial path and the other cultivated the inscription path.</p><p>The taller Dean cultivated martial arts, while the thinner Dean cultivated the Dao of inscription.</p><p>“How about this, why don’t the Tianxia Academy form an alliance with us and head to the Northern Plains together? this way, our strength will be even stronger and we will have a greater chance of resisting the Ditian divine Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>The two deans of the Tianxia Academy looked at each other, then cupped their hands together and said, ” “Lu Ming, we have the same intention!”</p><p>that’s good, haha, then let’s not delay this any longer. We will set off for Northern Plains now. If we are late, the Emperor heaven divine Palace will most likely come!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, we’ll set off immediately. You may enter the White jade Palace. It’s a secret treasure!</p><p>The tall director said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the group flew into the White jade Palace.</p><p>Xie Luan didn’t say anything during this process.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
