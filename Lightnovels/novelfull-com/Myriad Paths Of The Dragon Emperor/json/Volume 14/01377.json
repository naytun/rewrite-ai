It had a Grand aura and occupied a vast area.</p><p>...</p><p>After recruiting the old man, he brought them to the outskirts of the mountain and stopped.</p><p>so many inscription Masters! What a huge array!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the area and discovered that there were at least a hundred inscription Masters at the periphery of the mountain. Every one of them was a level-eight inscription master.</p><p>The entire mountain’s periphery was covered by a huge formation.</p><p>alright, this is the place you will be guarding. There is a large array here. Each of you will be part of the large array. You will need to inject your mind power frequently to maintain the operation of the large array. How about it? it’s simple, right? ”</p><p>The old man who recruited them said.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This was indeed very simple. They only needed to inject their spiritual power to maintain the operation of the formation.</p><p>“However, there is one thing I must warn you about. This is the forbidden area of the South God Palace. You’d better stay in the outer area and don’t wander around, especially in the depths of this mountain. If you are discovered by the experts of the South God Palace, no one can save you!”</p><p>The recruitment elder changed his tone and warned everyone.</p><p>The others felt a chill in their hearts and nodded repeatedly. However, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He had a stronger feeling that Long Chen was most likely being held here.</p><p>They were people recruited from outside and were only in charge of the outer circle. They couldn’t let outsiders be in charge of the mountain’s internal affairs.</p><p>The old man who recruited them said a few more words and told them the areas each of them were responsible for before leaving.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on a green rock. He carefully spread his mental energy out and observed.</p><p>There were many experts near the mountain. Lu Ming did not dare to be too presumptuous.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had lit up Two Spirit lamps and his control of his mental energy had reached the realm of perfection. When his mental energy was released, even an ordinary third level Martial Emperor would not be able to detect it.</p><p>Unless it was a Lv 4 martial monarch.</p><p>However, even in the divine Ruins continent, a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert was considered a peak expert, and there were not many of them.</p><p>His mental energy spread further and further. Very soon, the entire outer area of the mountain was covered by Lu Ming’s mental energy.</p><p>Outside the mountain, there was a huge formation. It had the functions of sensing, attacking, and defending. Once someone broke in, it would immediately alert everyone and attack at the same time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming soon understood all the secrets of the array.</p><p>The array was huge and required so many level-eight alchemists to control it at the same time. Its power was shocking, but it had more flaws. Lu Ming could easily find dozens of them.</p><p>Of course, this was only for Lu Ming. To other level-eight alchemists, they would only feel that the array was mysterious, Grand, and unbelievably complicated.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use his mental energy to cover the depths of the mountain as he was afraid that there were experts guarding it.</p><p>Soon, night fell.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved.</p><p>A figure that looked exactly like Lu Ming appeared where he was standing. This was Lu Ming’s formation. His figure, on the other hand, was heading towards the depths of the mountain.</p><p>To Lu Ming, the large array outside was like a flat road. It did not pose any obstacle.</p><p>After passing through the array, Lu Ming came to the depths of the mountain.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming stopped.</p><p>He looked into the depths of the mountain, and there seemed to be a formation rotating in his eyes.</p><p>“What a wondrous formation!”</p><p>Very soon, everything deep in the mountain appeared before Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>At the bottom of the mountain, there was a cave. Clearly, there was another world inside the mountain.</p><p>And on the path leading to this cave, a large formation was inscribed.</p><p>This kind of formation was extremely profound.</p><p>“It’s actually the great realm energy chain formation!”</p><p>After watching for a while, Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He felt that it was a little tricky.</p><p>The great array of connected realm energy was a pure sensing array. It did not have any offensive or defensive power. It only had the ability to sense. As long as someone walked into the great array of realm energy, the great array would sound an alarm.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming could easily break an ordinary sensing array. However, even he would find it difficult to break the linked realm energy array in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that there were a total of ten major arrays in front of him. They were interconnected and each of the ten major arrays had locked onto one type of aura.</p><p>Ten formations meant ten different auras, which were the auras of ten people.</p><p>If he wanted to break this kind of array, he could only use the aura of these ten people to refine an array-breaking token. Only then would he be able to enter silently.</p><p>Otherwise, no matter how powerful the formation was, it would still be able to sense him and send out an alarm.</p><p>It was obvious that if Long Chen was locked up in this mountain, the others in the mountain would move him away as soon as the alarm was sounded. Even if they forced their way in, they wouldn’t be able to save him.</p><p>If he wanted to enter the mountain without a sound, he had to break the realm energy chain formation.</p><p>But how to crack it? Most importantly, Lu Ming did not know whose aura it was. How was he going to get the auras of these ten people!</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and then backed out, returning to his original position.</p><p>the South God Palace really values the mixed-essence token. They’re so heavily guarded. It’s not that easy to save Long Chen!</p><p>Lu Ming was pondering in his heart.</p><p>“In order to break this realm energy chain array and refine the array breaking token, I must have the auras of those ten people, but which ten people do they belong to? I’ve heard that the South God Palace is led by the top ten families. Could it be that the aura of these ten people are the patriarchs of the top ten families?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>This possibility was the highest.</p><p>However, there was no guarantee that Lu Ming planned to find an opportunity to secretly investigate.</p><p>For the next seven days, Lu Ming was thinking of this strategy but he came up with nothing.</p><p>On the eighth night, Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed. He saw a figure flickering in the mountains.</p><p>It was so fast that there was no movement at all. Not even a shadow could be seen. The level-eight alchemists did not notice it at all.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming’s powerful cultivation, it would have been difficult for him to discover it.</p><p>This figure seemed to be very familiar with the formation on the outside. He shuttled through the formation and headed towards the inner part of the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He moved and followed the figure into the mountain.</p><p>After passing through the formation, the figure stopped.</p><p>The figure was wrapped in a black robe and her appearance could not be seen clearly. However, from the figure, it was clearly a woman.</p><p>Long Chen, I know that the South God Palace has gone too far by treating you like this. Unfortunately, I can’t do anything about it!</p><p>The figure sighed slightly.</p><p>The voice was very soft but Lu Ming could still hear it.</p><p>“This is … Ji hongchen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>This voice was clearly Ji hongchen’s voice. Lu Ming would definitely not remember it wrong.</p><p>Ji hongchen did not stay for long before he turned and left.</p><p>Lu Ming followed behind Ji hongchen.</p><p>“Should we get Ji hongchen’s help?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was not very close to Ji hongchen, he still acknowledged Ji hongchen’s character.</p><p>And from the looks of it, Ji hongchen seemed to have the intention to help Long Chen, but he was helpless.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and followed Ji hongchen out of the mountain. They headed to the other areas of the South God Palace.</p><p>However, not long after, Ji hongchen’s figure suddenly stopped. His gaze shifted as he berated, ” “Who is it? Are you following me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
