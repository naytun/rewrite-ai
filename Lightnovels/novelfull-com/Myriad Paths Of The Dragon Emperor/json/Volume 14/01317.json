He was an Emperor of a dominant force in the central continent. He had joined Di Yi and attacked the Tianxia Academy with the third emperor of the dead.</p><p>On the surface, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had only sent the two of them this time.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The mountain breaker Martial Emperor was a burly man who was more than three meters tall. He wielded a broadsword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the third underworld Emperor launched an attack on Lu Ming while he was healing his body.</p><p>The two sovereigns joined forces to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw two consecutive punches. His fists were in a state of chaos.</p><p>This was not the chaos concept, but Lu Ming’s martial arts technique that combined five types of concepts.</p><p>The first to bear the brunt were the two Emperor’s domains. The two domains covered Lu Ming’s entire body and continuously depleted Lu Ming’s attacks. Invisible attacks were constantly attacking Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force blasted out and the domain trembled continuously. Lu Ming charged into the domain and fought with the two emperors.</p><p>The mountain breaker Martial Emperor had a burly figure and was known for his offensive and physical strength. However, after exchanging a single blow with Lu Ming, he was still forced to retreat. If it were not for the third hell Emperor’s help, Lu Ming could have taken the opportunity to defeat the mountain breaker Martial Emperor.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming still had the upper hand at the beginning of the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming! That’s Lu Ming!</p><p>A group of people stood in the White jade Palace of the Tianxia Academy. Among them were figures that Lu Ming was familiar with, such as Kong Xin and goddess Tan Xiang.</p><p>The valley of the medicine Masters, without a sovereign, would find it difficult to protect themselves in this chaotic world.</p><p>However, the valley of the medicine Masters had a good relationship with the Tianxia Academy, so the valley of the medicine Masters had long sought refuge with the Tianxia Academy and moved to the Tianxia Academy.</p><p>It was Kong Xin who had just spoken. His voice was full of disbelief as he stared into the distance.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming! He’s not dead! This is amazing! Lu Ming is able to suppress two emperors!</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s eyes also widened, and her voice was filled with shock.</p><p>Originally, when the Emperor heaven divine Palace launched an attack on the Tianxia Academy, they had already defended for a few days. If this continued, it would be very early for them to be defeated.</p><p>However, when they discovered that the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was in chaos, they thought that it was the heaven suppressing divine Army or Xie Luan of the Northern Plains who had sent reinforcements. In the end, they discovered that there was only one person, a young man.</p><p>They found out in disbelief that the young man was Lu Ming, the Lu Ming who was said to have died in the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>The combat strength that Lu Ming had displayed shocked them even more.</p><p>“He’s truly a peerless genius, one of a kind!”</p><p>A white-haired old man beside Kong Xin sighed.</p><p>This white-haired old man was one of the two emperors of Tianxia Academy.</p><p>“Dean, this is a rare opportunity. I think we should rush out and cooperate with Lu Ming to defeat the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang suggested.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>The Emperor of the Tianxia Academy muttered, ” the Ditian divine Palace will not only send two emperors to attack our Tianxia Academy. Perhaps there are more emperors hiding in the dark. Now that Lu Ming has the upper hand, we are not in a hurry to attack. It will not be too late to attack after we have a clear view of the enemy!</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Kong Xin, fairy Tan Xiang, and the others nodded.</p><p>Indeed, now that Lu Ming had the upper hand, the ones who should be anxious should be the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, not them. If the Empyrean heaven divine Palace still had a sovereign hidden in the dark, they would not be able to hold it in for long and would attack.</p><p>In the North, tens of thousands of miles away, Xie Luan and the others were hiding in the void, looking into the distance.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had defeated qu Luo before, they could not hide their shock when they saw Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>“Ancestor devil, should we make our move now and annihilate this group of people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace in one fell swoop?”</p><p>Mo Ye asked.</p><p>“Wait a minute. There might be experts from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace hiding in the dark. We’ll act according to the situation!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>High up in the sky, three figures criss-crossed and engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Every time they crossed paths, there would be a muffled explosion between the sky and the earth. It was as if the sky and the earth had just been split open and the universe was rumbling. The terrifying fluctuations shook some people’s eardrums, causing their bodies to tremble and they spat out blood.</p><p>The Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace retreated again and again, distancing themselves from the battlefield.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming combined five martial arts techniques of creation, and the power was shocking. He threw a punch and hit the saber of the mountain breaker Martial Emperor. The mountain breaker Martial Emperor’s body trembled and he was sent flying.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned his left hand and struck down with his palm. The Qi of the netherworld rolled and the third emperor of the dead was sent flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was as fast as lightning. In a flash, he rushed toward the third underworld Emperor. Terrifying attacks poured down on the third underworld Emperor.</p><p>The third emperor of the dead tried his best, but it was difficult for him to resist. Wherever Lu Ming’s fist passed, the netherworld Qi was obliterated. The third emperor of the dead screamed in pain as his body almost exploded.</p><p>On the other side, the mountain breaker Martial Emperor came to the rescue.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The lightning cauldron appeared above Lu Ming’s head and smashed toward Martial Emperor mountain breaker.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the lightning cauldron’s power increased when he controlled it.</p><p>The Thunder cauldron collided with the battle saber of Martial Emperor Poshan heavily. Although the Thunder cauldron was sent flying away, it had also blocked the attack of Martial Emperor Poshan. That was enough.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the third emperor of the dead and threw a punch. The Qi of the netherworld exploded, and the third emperor of the dead was sent flying with a scream. Half of his body exploded, and his aura weakened. His injuries were even worse.</p><p>And this was the third emperor of the dead. His netherworld body was mysterious and ever-changing.</p><p>If it had been any other Emperor, they would have been more seriously injured after being hit by Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Even so, the third underworld Emperor was still terrified. He turned around and ran.</p><p>He was afraid. If this went on, he would really be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he walked toward the third underworld Emperor. At the same time, he focused his mind and spread his spiritual sense in all directions, as if he was waiting for something.</p><p>In a few steps, Lu Ming was close to the third underworld Emperor, and his terrifying attack was about to land on the third underworld Emperor.</p><p>“Evil beast, you dare!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the endless void. As soon as the voice was heard, a golden sword light descended from the sky and cut down on Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“It’s dangerous!”</p><p>Facing this golden sword light, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end. His heart trembled as he felt a fatal danger.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Without any hesitation, the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. Lu Ming performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into Nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Each of the nine dragon claws was a fusion of five martial techniques of creation, and they were all aimed at the golden sword light.</p><p>An ear-piercing sound resounded between heaven and earth. The golden sword light was so sharp that it could cut through everything. The attack formed by the five martial techniques of creation was broken by the golden sword light one by one.</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘body trembled, and they couldn’t help but retreat a thousand miles before they could stabilize themselves.</p><p>The result was that three of the nine dragon claws were cut off.</p><p>Fortunately, this was the body of Blood Meridian. Lu Ming circulated the power of Blood Meridian and his three dragon claws were rapidly recovering.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
