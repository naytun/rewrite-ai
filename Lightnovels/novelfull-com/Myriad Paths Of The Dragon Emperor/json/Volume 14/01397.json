He had given all the spiritual herbs he had to dandan and bubbles. However, even if he took them out, they would not be worth much.</p><p>...</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not take out items that were too precious, such as the Thunder cauldron and the air-frozen bead.</p><p>Only an Emperor spiritual weapon could be used.</p><p>“Senior, may I know how many mid grade raw stones an Emperor weapon is worth?”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a large saber and asked.</p><p>On the divine Ruins continent, Lu Ming had killed so many emperors and obtained nearly twenty Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>“An Emperor spiritual weapon is not bad. It’s worth a million raw gemstones!”</p><p>The old man’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“A million raw gemstones?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. The value of an Emperor spiritual weapon had greatly exceeded his expectations.</p><p>It was higher than he had imagined.</p><p>brother Lu, usually, only those at the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm and above can unleash the full power of an Emperor weapon. Only a Saint can make one. Although there are many of them in the yuan continent, there are too many high-level martial emperors. The demand is too high, so the value of an Emperor weapon has always been very high!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization.</p><p>Indeed, there were a lot of Emperor spiritual weapons in the yuan continent. However, there were even more high-level emperors. The demand for them exceeded the supply, so their value was naturally high.</p><p>For example, in the small continents outside of the yuan continent, like the divine wilderness continent, the Emperor spiritual weapon was usually left behind by Saints or high-level emperors who went to those places.</p><p>It was basically impossible for anyone to make it. Many of them were passed down from the yuan continent.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming had obtained the Emperor spirit tower in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. It was also brought from the yuan continent by the Tianxuan Saint.</p><p>That was how the divine Ruins ‘continent group’s Emperor spiritual weapons usually came about. They had only accumulated a few after countless years.</p><p>“Little brother, do you want to sell this Emperor spiritual weapon? If you want to sell it, this old man will buy it!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“I’m selling it. Senior, I still have another one!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out an iron rod-like Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>The elder and the Qiu siblings were surprised. They did not expect Lu Ming to have so many King spiritual weapons.</p><p>alright, I’ll buy it. Here are 1.9 million raw gemstones and this bottle of Supreme-grade life potion!</p><p>The elder passed Lu Ming a storage ring and the bottle of life potion.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He found a pile of raw gemstones in the storage ring.</p><p>Each piece was filled with rich origin Qi, which was many times purer and richer than a low-grade raw stone.</p><p>This was a mid-grade raw stone. Using a mid-grade raw stone to cultivate would naturally be many times faster than using a low-grade raw stone.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it and continued to wander around with Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming realized that there were too many treasures here.</p><p>All the spirit herbs were level nine. Level eight spirit herbs were rare.</p><p>There were also all sorts of blacksmithing materials, spiritual liquid, and so on, all of which were of very high grade.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming bought quite a number of spiritual herbs. Very soon, the 1.9 million medium-grade raw stones were almost depleted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached. These were two Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>However, the spiritual liquid and spiritual medicine that he had bought were all very useful.</p><p>The spiritual liquid sped up the growth of the path-understanding ancient tree, while the spiritual medicine sped up dandan and bubbles ‘recovery.</p><p>After coming to Yuan continent, he realized that he had become a pauper. Although he still had many Emperor spiritual weapons, if he continued to use them, he would soon run out.</p><p>In the meantime, the Qiu siblings also bought some things.</p><p>get lost! I have my eyes on this green blue fruit!</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar could be heard.</p><p>nonsense, What do you mean you like it? I said I like it. If you don’t have money, then get lost!</p><p>Another voice rang out.</p><p>Who Do You Think You Are? you told me to get lost. If you have the ability, let’s fight on the fighting stage!</p><p>The voice from before rang out.</p><p>“A battle it is!”</p><p>The voice behind them was heard. Then, they saw some people flying in one direction.</p><p>there’s a battle between sovereigns. Brother Lu, let’s go to the battle platform and take a look!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Alright, I’d like to experience it too!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a curious look.</p><p>Then, the three of them followed the crowd and walked towards the fighting ring.</p><p>In the dueling platform, disciples of the Dragon God Valley would usually settle their disputes there.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had just arrived when they heard a violent roar.</p><p>On a huge fighting ring, two figures were constantly clashing.</p><p>The two burly men in their thirties kept punching each other, causing violent rumbles between heaven and earth.</p><p>he’s in the third level of the martial Royal realm, but his combat strength is so strong!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He realized that the cultivation of the two opponents was at the early stage of the third level martial Royal realm. However, the combat strength they displayed was beyond Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>He felt that the fourth level martial emperors in the divine Ruins ‘continent group were not their match. The combat power that the two of them had displayed had completely exceeded the combat power of the fourth level martial emperors in the divine Ruins’ continent group.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>brother Lu, do you feel that these two people’s combat strength is very strong? ”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Indeed, he is much stronger than the Emperor of my continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>yes, we were also very surprised when we first arrived. However, this is the combat power of an ordinary sovereign in the yuan continent!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained, ” in the yuan continent, no matter if it’s martial arts or the Dao of inscription, they have all been developed to the extreme. Compared to the other continents, they are much stronger. All kinds of martial techniques, bloodlines, concepts, domains, and spiritual bodies have been developed to the extreme. Therefore, the cultivators here are all very strong, far stronger than those in other continents!</p><p>emperors, unless they’re servants with low status, have all cultivated domain martial techniques. Their combat strength is amazing.</p><p>Yuan continent. It’s indeed Yuan continent!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>The cultivation civilization of the origin continent had already developed to the extreme, and it was far from what the continent of the divine Ruins could compare to. It could be said that in the origin continent, a decent cultivator was a genius who could challenge those of a higher level in the continent of the divine Ruins.</p><p>Lu Ming was reminded of the people di Xian had brought with him. Those people were not very strong.</p><p>Perhaps, in the DI family, the status of those people was just like that of servants, which explained why their combat strength was not particularly high.</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were in a whirl and he felt immense pressure.</p><p>There were too many experts here, and the streets were filled with emperors. Saints were the Supreme experts.</p><p>Moreover, the emperors here all had extraordinary combat strength.</p><p>In the divine Ruins ‘continent group, Lu Ming could fight with a peak Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert and even overpower the other party without using the chaos sky-turning seal and without the help of his second body.</p><p>However, in this place, without using the chaos sky-turning seal and without the help of his clone, Lu Ming could only fight with an early-stage second level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that after he used the chaos sky-turning seal, he could probably fight with a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
