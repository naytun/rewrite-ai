Lu Ming cultivated and practiced martial arts every day to adapt to the environment.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming had completely adapted to the yuan continent’s environment. At this time, Lu Ming opened the door of the ice cave and went out for some fresh air.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>A delicate cry rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and saw Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>“Young lady Qiu, brother Qiu, what a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, how are you adapting to this?”</p><p>Qiu Hao waved his fan and smiled.</p><p>To be honest, Qiu Hao was very handsome. He was wearing a long robe and waving a folding fan, like an elegant young master.</p><p>“I’ve already completely adapted to it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>that’s great. We’re going to the market. Brother Lu, do you want to come with us? ”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“A market? Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed immediately. He was also very curious.</p><p>The environment of the yuan continent was excellent. It would definitely produce countless natural treasures that the divine wilderness continent could not compare to. Lu Ming wanted to see it. If there were any suitable ones, he wanted to buy some.</p><p>The three of them walked out of the side valley together, and then followed the huge Glacier Valley into the depths of the valley.</p><p>This Canyon was only the outer Valley. Those who lived here were basically reserve disciples and some odd-job workers.</p><p>The real Dragon God Valley was located in the depths of the valley, in the vast snow mountains.</p><p>The market was located deep in the canyon. Many official disciples of the Dragon God Valley frequented the market, so there were good things there.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at the market.</p><p>The city square took up a huge area. There were stalls on both sides of the street. The layout was similar to that of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In the market, people came and went.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming released his spiritual senses and scanned the area. His heart trembled.</p><p>Five out of ten people walking on the streets were all emperors.</p><p>Some of them were still very young, looking like they were in their twenties.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that Lu Ming saw a few 12 or 13-year-old teenagers. They still had a childish look on their faces and were also Emperor Warriors.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s expression, Qiu Ying Ying smiled and said, ” brother Lu, when we first arrived, we were also shocked. However, it’s also because the cultivation environment in Yuan continent is too good. It’s much easier to break through to the Emperor realm than in the other continents!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, martial emperors were the absolute overlords. They dominated and ruled over an area. However, in the yuan continent, in Dragon God Valley, they were actually everywhere.</p><p>One could only imagine how many emperors there were in the entire Yuan continent. They were not worth much.</p><p>It was no wonder that the sovereigns of the divine wilderness continent wanted to come to the yuan continent but did not dare to. They wanted to join the big sects of the yuan continent so that they could be protected.</p><p>That was because in the yuan continent, emperors were nothing. There were a lot of them. Without a backer, it was extremely dangerous to cultivate outside. One could die if they were not careful.</p><p>in Dragon God Valley, Lv 1 to Lv 3 martial emperors are worthless and have no status. They are just like servants. Only those above Lv 4 Martial Emperor have some status. Those above Lv 7 Martial Emperor are the backbone of Dragon God Valley and can be assigned some duties!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained in a low voice, and then added, ” “Of course, young geniuses don’t count!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Of course, he understood that young geniuses had different statuses no matter where they were.</p><p>Because being young meant infinite possibilities!</p><p>“This is … The elixir of life, and it’s a top-grade elixir of life!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw the elixir of life at a stall.</p><p>top-grade water of life!</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, Lu Ming had seen the elixir of life before. However, he had never heard of a Supreme-grade elixir of life. This was because there was no such thing in the divine wilderness continent or even the divine Ruins continent. It was almost extinct.</p><p>Supreme-grade elixir of life was extremely useful to even emperors, as it could heal their injuries.</p><p>As expected of yuanlu. The moment he arrived, he saw such a precious spiritual medicine.</p><p>Lu Ming’s clone was severely injured. This premium elixir of life was extremely important to his clone. Lu Ming had to get it.</p><p>“Senior, how much is this bottle of elixir of life?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said to the stall owner.</p><p>The stall owner was an old man with white hair.</p><p>“100000 raw stones!” The old man raised a finger.</p><p>“A hundred thousand raw gemstones?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>It was not because it was too expensive, but because it was too cheap.</p><p>A bottle of top-grade elixir of life was a legendary treasure in the divine Ruins continent group, but it only cost 100000 raw gemstones?</p><p>Lu Ming was in disbelief. He asked again, ” “Senior, only a hundred thousand raw stones?”</p><p>“Of course, not a single one more, not a single one more!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll buy it!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring. There were one hundred thousand raw stones inside.</p><p>The old man took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. His expression changed and he threw the storage ring back to Lu Ming.”Junior, are you playing with this old man?”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of question marks.</p><p>“Senior, please don’t take offense. Brother Lu just came from the outer continent, so there are some rules that he doesn’t understand!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying quickly tried to smooth things over.</p><p>“Oh? So you’re the new reserve disciple from the outer continent!”</p><p>The old man’s expression softened.</p><p>brother Lu, the raw stone this senior is talking about is a medium-grade raw stone!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s actually a mid-grade raw stone?”</p><p>yes, the raw stones commonly used in the yuan continent are mid-grade raw stones. Generally speaking, the number of raw stones referred to mid-grade raw stones. Low-grade raw stones are almost useless in the yuan continent. They are considered useless stones. Only in special circumstances will they be used!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The cultivation environment in the yuan continent was too good. Cultivating at will was equivalent to using low-grade raw gemstones. Therefore, low-grade raw gemstones were useless.</p><p>Only mid-grade raw stones were mainstream.</p><p>One mid-grade raw stone was equivalent to ten thousand low-grade raw stones.</p><p>One hundred thousand medium-grade raw stones were equivalent to one billion low-grade raw stones.</p><p>This price was reasonable.</p><p>However, the problem was that Lu Ming did not have any mid-grade raw stones.</p><p>He had killed so many emperors, and there were at least tens of billions of low-grade raw stones in his storage ring.</p><p>However, in the yuan continent, low-grade raw stones were useless.</p><p>What a waste!</p><p>Lu Ming wailed in his heart. His heart ached.</p><p>There were so many raw gemstones here, but they were actually useless and had become useless.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was equivalent to a pauper with nothing to his name.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned green.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s reaction, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao smiled bitterly. They were the same when they first arrived.</p><p>“Little fellow, haha, the low grade raw stones you brought with you are useless now, right? If you have any treasures on you, you can use them to exchange for it!”</p><p>The old man laughed, but he didn’t mean to laugh. He was used to this kind of thing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
