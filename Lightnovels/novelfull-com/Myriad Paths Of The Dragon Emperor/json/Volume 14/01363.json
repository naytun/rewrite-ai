How can a Supreme martial artist possess a spirit body?”</p><p>The Emperor of the Dragon Alliance was in an uproar. Even existences like Xie Luan and the old general, who had lived for many years, were shocked.</p><p>They could naturally feel the power of di Xian’s spirit body.</p><p>innate spirit body, it’s an innate spirit body. Haha, these country bumpkins don’t know the power of an innate spirit body. An innate spirit body is an innate spirit body!</p><p>Behind him, Di Yi’s eyes were filled with shock, but at the same time, he laughed in his heart.</p><p>He was born in the yuan continent, so his vision was naturally different.</p><p>He knew that some people were blessed by the heavens and were born with a spirit body. This was called an innate spirit body.</p><p>Such people were innately unrivaled geniuses. Needless to say, their bloodline would definitely be able to awaken to the ninth level of the divine level. At the same time, their bloodline and spirit body would definitely be in perfect harmony.</p><p>This kind of person, whether it was bloodline martial techniques, comprehension of intent, or other martial techniques, was blessed by the heavens and had an advantage over others. Therefore, his combat strength was also terrifyingly strong.</p><p>Di Xian was such a person.</p><p>“If you can block one of my moves, come again!”</p><p>die! di Xian shouted. On the surface of his body, wisps of sword-like radiance circulated. He slashed his combat sword, and the sword Qi was shocking as it slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and cast the chaos will. At the same time, his third bloodline appeared and he threw another punch.</p><p>The same prison suppressing heaven technique, when combined with the chaos intent, had its power increase explosively.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not move an inch. On the other hand, di Xian retreated backward.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>Di Xian flew into a rage after being pushed back. He raised his aura to the maximum and covered his entire body with his territory. He charged at Lu Ming and slashed with his sword. The roars of hundreds of beasts could be heard.</p><p>Di Xian’s martial technique wasn’t simple. It seemed to push the power of the domain to its limit.</p><p>Domain martial technique!</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>A domain martial skill was the same as a concept martial skill.</p><p>Martial techniques of creation could exert the power of creation to the extreme, while martial techniques of domain could exert the power of domain to the extreme.</p><p>Di Xian’s domain martial skill was even more powerful, and his sword light seemed to be able to destroy everything.</p><p>Lu Ming infused the chaos concept into his body and engaged in an intense battle with his opponent. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>To be honest, di Xian was very powerful. He was the strongest member of the younger generation that Lu Ming had met so far.</p><p>His combat strength was comparable to Lu Ming’s combat strength before he broke through to the Supreme-being realm. It was equivalent to the peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>He was only a Supreme martial artist, but his battle prowess was already so shocking that it was beyond imagination.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, he was even stronger than Long Chen.</p><p>One must know that the bloodline awakened by Long Chen was one of the top ten war beasts, the Archean dragonesque elephant!</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had broken through to the Supreme-being realm, he naturally did not take him seriously.</p><p>damn it! How could there be such a powerful person on a mere Savage Island?!</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked di Xian was.</p><p>this person must have a secret. If I can obtain his secret, I will definitely become stronger. I might even be able to compete with those monstrous geniuses in the clan!</p><p>Thinking of this, di Xian’s heart started to burn.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His glabella glowed and a golden combat sword flew out, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the combat sword and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered, but he was not surprised. The other party was so talented and had an extraordinary background. It was normal for him to have an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Di Xian shouted and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got? Then let’s end this!”</p><p>chaos concept! Lu Ming shouted. The chaos concept that lingered around his body suddenly changed. At first, it shrank rapidly and then bloomed.</p><p>What bloomed out was no longer intent, but a domain, the embryonic form of the chaos Domain.</p><p>At the same time, the aura on Lu Ming’s body rose rapidly.</p><p>Supreme martial artist! The Alliance master has broken through to the Supreme martial artist realm!</p><p>Xie Luan and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist was wrapped in the early stage of the chaos realm. He punched di Xian’s Emperor spiritual weapon sword.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword shook violently. Di Xian’s expression changed. His body shook and he was sent flying like a cannonball. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>When Lu Ming revealed his true abilities, he was crushed and was severely injured by a single punch.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and caught up with di Xian. He threw a punch at di Xian’s heart.</p><p>This punch was enough to penetrate di Xian’s heart.</p><p>However, just as Lu Ming’s punch was about to hit di Xian’s heart, di Xian’s body suddenly emitted a golden light and a golden armor appeared.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist landed on the armor. The armor shook violently but it was not broken. It blocked most of Lu Ming’s fist force.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s punch was too powerful. Although the armor had blocked most of the force, a small part of the force from the punch still hit di Xian’s body. Di Xian screamed in pain. His chest caved in and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“It’s a defensive Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This Emperor Xian was really rich. It even had a defensive Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>The ones that Lu Ming had encountered in the past were all offensive Emperor spiritual weapons. In comparison, defensive Emperor spiritual weapons were more precious than offensive ones.</p><p>It was a defensive Emperor spiritual weapon that could save one’s life at critical moments. Just like just now, if di Xian did not have this armor, he would have been killed by Lu Ming with one punch.</p><p>“How dare you hurt the young master!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Di Xian was severely injured. The subordinates he had brought with him all roared in anger and launched fierce attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Six peak second level martial emperors and two third level martial emperors attacked at the same time. The power was shocking.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the others changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was the Dragon vein sword, the emperor’s spiritual weapon that he had snatched from the flood Dragon sovereign when he was fighting for the pure spirit body cultivation technique in the ancient underwater city.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the Martial Emperor realm and mastered the embryonic form of his territory, he could already activate the power of an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s early stage domain was the early stage of the chaos Domain. The chaos Domain could transform into other domains at will. In other words, no matter what type of King spiritual weapon it was, except for a few types such as space-time, Lu Ming could use it.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The combat sword slashed across, and a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert was cut in half at the waist, dying on the spot.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Then, he moved his sword horizontally and exchanged a blow with a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“Let’s attack!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie Luan controlled an Emperor spiritual weapon and a demonic blade to attack the two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm martial artists.</p><p>At the same time, the old general and tu Qian also made their moves. Both of them controlled their King spiritual weapons and enveloped the remaining two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm martial artists.</p><p>None of the six peak second level martial Royal realm experts under di Xian had an Emperor spiritual weapon, so Xie Luan and the other two were enough to deal with them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
