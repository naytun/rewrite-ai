Instead, she would only distract him.</p><p>At this moment, she hated that her cultivation was low and she could not share Lu Ming’s burden.</p><p>She gritted her teeth secretly. She must work hard in cultivation and try her best to keep up with Lu Ming’s pace. In the future, she would be able to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll cultivate here. You must be careful!”</p><p>Finally, Xie nianqing spoke.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched Xie nianqing’s soft black hair, then he gave Xie nianqing a light Peck on his red lips and floated away.</p><p>Looking in the direction that Lu Ming left, Xie nianqing swore to himself that he would never be a burden to Lu Ming again.</p><p>first, I’ll break through to the Supreme-being realm. Then, I’ll become an Emperor!</p><p>Determination flashed in Xie nianqing’s eyes. He turned and walked into the mountain that was filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>After Lu Ming left Xie nianqing, he traveled thousands of miles in an instant. Half a day later, he had flown an endless distance.</p><p>At this moment, a figure stepped out from between his eyebrows and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the clone’s body began to change. Runes appeared on his body, and his aura also began to change. After a while, the clone changed into a new set of clothes and became a completely different person.</p><p>After disguising himself, the second body tore open the void and headed toward the South God Palace.</p><p>As for the main body, it found a place to cultivate in peace.</p><p>His plan was simple. Just like what Xie nianqing had told him, he would sneak into the South God Palace to find out more about the situation, while his main body would cultivate outside. He would occasionally appear to attract the attention of others.</p><p>Currently, his main body was mainly cultivating three types.</p><p>The first was, of course, the early stage domain!</p><p>When a domain was first formed, it was very small. It needed to be nurtured continuously before it could slowly mature. When the domain reached its limit, one could then start to break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming did not stop nurturing the embryonic stage of the domain. He had made great progress but he was still a distance away from his limit.</p><p>The second thing to cultivate was the pure spirit body.</p><p>Now, the pure spirit body had reached the peak of 70%, and it would soon reach 80%.</p><p>The third was to cultivate five martial techniques of creation.</p><p>The five martial techniques were all at the fifth level, but they were close to the sixth level.</p><p>Once he broke through the sixth level, he could practice the chaos will martial technique, chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current cultivation should be called the chaos realm martial arts technique.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal was very special. If it was cultivated when one was in the state of conception, it would be a martial technique of conception. Now that Lu Ming had comprehended the embryonic form of the domain, if he cultivated it now and complemented it with the domain, it would become a domain martial technique with extremely shocking power.</p><p>Lu Ming was very much looking forward to it.</p><p>The main body cultivated quietly while the second body rushed toward the South God Palace.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at the South God Palace.</p><p>After a few months, Lu Ming came to the South God Palace again.</p><p>The last time he came, he was here to participate in the selection of disciples. In the end, he was still chased and had to escape from the South God Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts were in a whirl as he walked toward the South God Palace.</p><p>the South God Palace is recruiting inscriber!</p><p>Not long after he entered the South God Palace, Lu Ming heard this piece of news.</p><p>“Recruit an inscriber?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>After asking around, he finally knew why.</p><p>The South God Palace seemed to be guarding something. They recruited inscribers, inscribed arrays, and guarded the arrays.</p><p>As for what it was, there were different opinions and all sorts of guesses.</p><p>“Could it be that the South God Palace is guarding Long Chen?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>The mixed essence token could allow one to enter and leave the divine Ruins safely. Everyone wanted it, and the other three great divine palaces were also eyeing it.</p><p>Since the South God Palace controlled Long Chen, it was equivalent to controlling a mixed-essence token. Naturally, they had to guard it tightly in case it was stolen by the other three great God palaces. Therefore, it was reasonable for them to recruit inscriers and strengthen the guard.</p><p>“Regardless, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he headed to the recruitment site.</p><p>When he arrived at the recruitment site, Lu Ming discovered that many people were inscription Masters.</p><p>The reward given by the South God Palace this time was extremely generous, which attracted many alchemists to sign up, but many of them looked depressed.</p><p>After some inquiries, Lu Ming knew why these people were depressed. It was because the inscription Masters recruited by the South God Palace had to be at least level eight.</p><p>A level-eight Alchemist was equivalent to a spiritual God Realm warrior.</p><p>To become an inscriber, one had to be very talented. Therefore, in this world, the number of people who practiced the path of inscriber was relatively small. Naturally, there were far fewer inscriers above the eighth rank than spiritual God Realm Warriors.</p><p>Those who were dejected were those who had not reached the eighth rank.</p><p>Lu Ming went forward and came to a counter.</p><p>we’re looking for an inscriber above the eighth rank. Are you an eighth-rank inscriber? ”</p><p>An old man in charge of recruitment looked at Lu Ming with a hint of contempt in his eyes.</p><p>After Lu Ming had changed his appearance, he looked ordinary, but he was very young. How could he be a level-eight Alchemist at such a young age?</p><p>The old man didn’t quite believe it.</p><p>The path of inscription was more difficult to cultivate than martial arts. The elder was a Supreme-level inscriber. It took him hundreds of years to break through to become a level-eight inscriber.</p><p>And how old was Lu Ming?</p><p>“I’m an eighth-rank Alchemist!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not take it to heart.</p><p>“Oh? You’re an eighth-rank Alchemist. Don’t lie to me. Show me your mental fire!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. A silver light was emitted from between his eyebrows. His strong mental energy filled the entire area, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>such pure mind power, such pure mind fire!</p><p>The recruiting elder gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was extremely pure. If the mental energy fire of ordinary people was like that of ordinary people, then Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was like that of an Emperor.</p><p>Yes, the old man felt that his mental energy fire seemed to be under great pressure.</p><p>“It should be fine now!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and kept the mental energy fire.</p><p>He had used a certain method to conceal the color of his mental energy fire, making it look like a silver mental energy fire. Moreover, Lu Ming tried his best to suppress it and only revealed a little bit.</p><p>The color could be changed and the quantity could be suppressed, but the essence of his mental energy fire could not be changed.</p><p>He was an Emperor and had inherited the legacy of the profound sky Saint. Every step he took was perfect, and his mind fire was naturally pure and condensed to the extreme. It was far from what ordinary people could compare to.</p><p>“Good, good. So little brother is a genius in the Dao of inscription. I was wrong just now, haha!”</p><p>The old man smiled awkwardly and registered Lu Ming’s information. After the registration, he passed Lu Ming a Jade card.</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade card and waited at the side.</p><p>A few hours later, the recruitment was over. They had recruited seven level-eight alchemists.</p><p>come with me to the place you’re supposed to guard. As for the reward, it’ll be paid every month. The South God Palace won’t be short of a single raw stone!</p><p>The recruitment elder led Lu Ming and the rest into the depths of the South God Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
