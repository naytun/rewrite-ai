However, they might not be able to obtain the mixed energy token.</p><p>Only those who were determined to have great potential could possibly obtain a mixed energy token.</p><p>Based on these two points, Lu Ming speculated that The Prodigy was 100% Long Chen.</p><p>The Wang family, through some means such as soul searching, had found out from Long Chen that Lu Ming also had a mixed-essence token.</p><p>However, there was one thing that Lu Ming could not figure out. For example, if the Wang family or the other experts of the South God Palace had secretly found out from Long Chen that Lu Ming also had a primordial chaos token, shouldn’t they have secretly sent experts to capture Lu Ming? How did he spread the news and let all the continents in the continent group of the divine Ruins know about it?</p><p>This did not make sense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura suddenly came down from the sky. The Imperial Dragon City was enveloped by a powerful pressure.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Soon after this stress rose up, more stress broke out and suffused the sky above Dragon Emperor City.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in Dragon Emperor City felt being crushed by Mount Tai and facing a great catastrophe.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, come out!”</p><p>Several roars were as loud as thunderclaps. The sky above the Imperial Dragon City was rumbling, which shook many people’s eardrums and almost made them vomit blood.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He took a step forward and landed on the skinny elder’s dantian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The violent power pierced through the skinny elder’s dantian and shattered his spiritual soul.</p><p>The old man’s eyes popped out and he roared, ” “You … You didn’t keep your word …”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, ” I didn’t say that I won’t kill you. Also, you came to the divine wilderness continent to take my primordial chaos token. Do you think I won’t kill you? ” You’re really naive!”</p><p>With a burst of power, the skinny old man was torn into pieces.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of air being torn rang out and five figures appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Besides Xie Luan, there were four other emperors.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming, the Imperial Dragon City was usually guarded by four other sovereigns.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared in the sky, he saw a few figures standing around the Imperial Dragon City.</p><p>“I am Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, the figures around the Imperial Dragon City appeared around Lu Ming and the others, surrounding them in the middle.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’m the divine sky Emperor of the zhuning continent. Hand over your mixed-essence token!</p><p>A burly man with golden hair glared at Lu Ming with an overbearing aura.</p><p>the mixed energy token is mine. I am the snow Moon Emperor of the fluttering snow continent!</p><p>A beautiful woman in white was staring at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>Both of them were at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Those who dared to cross the vast distance to the divine wilderness continent to participate in this contest were all top experts from their respective continents. Even the weakest of them was at the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Even the first level martial Royal realm experts did not dare to come.</p><p>He knew that even if he obtained the token, he wouldn’t be able to enjoy it.</p><p>“Fluttering snow continent, zhuning continent, get lost!”</p><p>A burly man in battle armor shouted coldly. His aura was extremely shocking. He was actually a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>a draw with the continent …</p><p>The snow Moon Emperor and the Holy sky Emperor both had grave expressions.</p><p>This third level martial Royal realm expert was from Ping Dong continent.</p><p>Even with the continents, they were all in the top ten of the divine Ruins ‘continent group and were very powerful.</p><p>Other than these three, there were another three people who were at the LV 2 martial Royal realm. One of them was the green-robed elder. He surrounded Lu Ming and the others, eyeing them like a tiger watching its prey.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over your primordial chaos token and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>The Emperor, who had fought evenly with the continent, looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>hehe, you’re here to take the mixed-essence token, but it seems you don’t know anything about it. The mixed-essence token was obtained in the battle of Providence and has long been integrated with me. Even if you take it, you can’t use it!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You can’t use it? That’s simple, as long as I cripple you and bring you along, I can similarly enter the divine Ruins and obtain the treasures inside!”</p><p>The Emperor of the continent laughed sinisterly.</p><p>“Oh, really? You’re so confident, but have you ever thought that you’ll lose your lives here?”</p><p>Lu Ming remained calm, but behind his calmness, a cold killing intent was slowly gathering.</p><p>“Hahaha, throw your life here? In the divine wilderness continent, what experts can they have that can do anything to me?”</p><p>The experts who fought to a draw with the continent laughed loudly, looking down on everyone.</p><p>“Oh? Since that’s the case, then die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly and suddenly launched an attack.</p><p>With the chaotic will lingering around him, he wielded the Dragon vein sword and slashed at the Emperor who had fought evenly with the continent.</p><p>The terrifying power caused the Emperor, who was fighting evenly with the continent, to change his expression.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>After fighting evenly with the Emperor of the continent, a halberd appeared in his hand. He let out a breath and slashed down with all his might.</p><p>As a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert, he could kill an ordinary Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert with a full-force attack.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s dragon vein sword hit his halberd, it shook violently and exploded with a bang.</p><p>The emperor’s body trembled violently after fighting evenly with him. Blood spurted from his mouth as he retreated.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The Emperor of the continent roared in disbelief.</p><p>He was a third-grade Martial Emperor, while Lu Ming was merely a Supreme. Although it was indeed unbelievable that he could reach the Supreme-being realm at such a young age, a Supreme-being was still just a Supreme-being after all. How could his combat strength be so powerful that he could injure him so severely with one move?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward. His combat sword cut through the void and slashed at the Emperor who was evenly matched with the continent.</p><p>The Emperor of the continent wanted to Dodge, but he suddenly found that dozens of formations had appeared around him. They were all formations to trap the enemy and had him trapped.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword slashed and cut the Emperor of the continent in half.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>On the side, the Holy sky Emperor, the fluttering snow Emperor, and the others were dumbfounded. They were completely stunned, and their eyes were wide open.</p><p>All of this happened too quickly. Lu Ming had just made his move, and within two moves, a third level Martial Emperor expert, an expert that they were so afraid of, was killed.</p><p>He thought he was dreaming!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword swept across and a second level martial Royal realm expert was killed.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The others were terrified and frantically fled in all directions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie Luan made his move. With a roar, he unsheathed his demonic blade and cut a Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert into two.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he took a step forward and appeared behind the fluttering snow divine warrior, slashing down with his combat sword.</p><p>The drifting snow sovereign desperately tried to block, but it was of no use.</p><p>The Battle Sword slashed down, breaking everything.</p><p>The drifting snow Emperor was dead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
