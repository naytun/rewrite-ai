An inscription flashed and Xie Zhen’s expression froze. His gaze was unfocused, as if he was in a daze.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming was using powerful means to search Xie Zhen’s soul.</p><p>Compared to Warriors, there were some techniques of an inscriber that were more mysterious and profound.</p><p>He had obtained the soul-searching technique from the mysterious sky Saint. Lu Ming wanted to find out the whereabouts of the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others from Xie Zhen.</p><p>“Evil creature, stop!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few angry shouts were heard as a few figures crossed the sky. As soon as the voices fell, a few terrifying attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Xie clan’s experts had arrived. These people were all at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not move, but a large array suddenly appeared in the sky. The large array glowed and condensed into a few combat swords. With a slash, a few seventh level spiritual God Realm experts were killed in the air.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>In the drunken immortal garden, many of the young geniuses trembled in their hearts. Lu Ming was too powerful. Killing a seventh level spiritual God was as easy as cutting melons and vegetables.</p><p>this person shouldn’t be someone from the younger generation. He must be someone from the older generation!</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming, he could not think of anyone else in the younger generation who was so powerful.</p><p>However, this person was obviously an Alchemist and should not be Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, many people guessed that he was an elder.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming frowned. He realized that in Xie Zhen’s memories, he did not know the whereabouts of the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others.</p><p>perhaps, Xie Zhen’s cultivation is too low and he doesn’t have the right to know about this!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. In the next moment, he turned to look at Xie Yan.</p><p>Xie Yan was a second-class heaven’s favorite. Other than Xie nianjun, he was the highest-ranking person in the younger generation of the Xie family. Perhaps he knew.</p><p>Under Lu Ming’s gaze, Xie Yan’s expression changed. Without a second thought, he soared into the sky, wanting to leave this place.</p><p>However, Lu Ming waved his palm gently in the air. Dense runes suddenly appeared above Xie Yan. A large array appeared and condensed into chains that wrapped around Xie Yan.</p><p>Xie Yan’s cultivation was at the second level of the spiritual God Realm. However, no matter how much he erupted, he was completely useless against the chains. He was bound tightly.</p><p>Lu Ming let go of Xie Zhen and walked towards Xie Yan.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s eyes were still unfocused, as if he had gone dumb.</p><p>Yes, Xie Zhen was already an idiot.</p><p>Earlier, when Lu Ming searched his soul, he did not control it at all. He used the most direct, violent, and brutal way to search for what Lu Ming wanted. Therefore, Xie Zhen’s soul suffered an indelible injury and he was already dumbfounded.</p><p>“Save me, save me!”</p><p>When Xie Yan saw Lu Ming walking towards him, he was so frightened that he screamed madly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>how dare you be so impudent in the holy city! Nine generations of your family will be executed!</p><p>Roars of anger could be heard from afar. More experts from the Xie family had arrived.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At least a dozen experts rushed over, and terrifying auras rushed up like smoke. The weakest aura was at the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm, and there were even perfected spiritual gods. The strongest person was surprisingly a Supreme-being.</p><p>In an instant, more than a dozen experts appeared in the sky above the drunken immortal garden and launched attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and dense runes appeared in the sky. They swam as if they had a life of their own and many large arrays were formed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The formation glowed, forming dozens of thick chains that wrapped around the dozen experts.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not even look at these people. He appeared in front of Xie Yan and pointed his finger between Xie Yan’s eyebrows.</p><p>Soul search!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there were continuous rumbles. More than a dozen powerhouses joined forces, but it was impossible to break through the defense.</p><p>Dozens of chains seemed to be alive, constantly waving and winding, making the dozen or so experts tired of dealing with them.</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger at Xie Yan’s glabella. After about ten breaths, his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He found it. He found the whereabouts of the Supreme Master of nine suns and the others.</p><p>In Xie Yan’s memory, the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others were imprisoned in the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>The abyss demon territory again.</p><p>Xie nianqing had been imprisoned in the abyss demon territory, and Xie Luan had been rescued from there.</p><p>“It seems that I have to go to the abyss demon territory again!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his finger leaving Xie Yan’s glabella. Xie Yan collapsed to the ground like a pile of mud, gasping for breath. His entire body was drenched in sweat.</p><p>He did not turn into an idiot like Xie Zhen. His cultivation was much stronger than Xie Zhen’s, having reached the second level of the spiritual God Realm. His soul was stable, so the damage to his soul was not great.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and an inscription flashed on his arm. A sword aura cut through the void.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The dozen or so powerhouses didn’t even have time to scream before they were killed by the sword Qi.</p><p>“Haha, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He took a step forward and his figure suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In the drunken immortal garden, many Young heaven’s favorites looked at each other with shock in their eyes.</p><p>He was too powerful. No matter what cultivation level he was at, he was killed in a single move. Even Supreme martial artists were killed in the same way.</p><p>A word appeared in everyone’s mind!</p><p>An Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming was most likely an impersonator of the Emperor.</p><p>An Emperor had infiltrated the holy city.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the depths of the sacred city, a terrifying aura shot up into the sky. A few figures appeared above the drunken immortal garden. The vast pressure made all the young people tremble as if they were about to kneel down.</p><p>Emperor. The people who appeared later were all emperors.</p><p>The few sovereigns spread out their spiritual senses to search for Lu Ming but they could not find any trace of him.</p><p>“Search the entire city, don’t let off any suspicious people!”</p><p>An Emperor ordered.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was still no news of Lu Ming after half a day.</p><p>And everything that happened in the drunken immortal garden had also spread throughout the sacred city.</p><p>An unfamiliar young man had first crippled Wu chengkong, then killed Dark Child. What was even more terrifying was that even a Supreme-being could not fight back.</p><p>One of the emperors, Xie Zhen, had even become an idiot because of this person.</p><p>The news shocked the sacred city.</p><p>Many people knew that Northern Plains or the heaven suppressing divine Army had started to move.</p><p>Everyone started to guess who this young man was.</p><p>Some people guessed that it was Lu Ming, because Lu Ming was most likely to have sneaked into the holy city to save Supreme nine suns and the others.</p><p>However, someone immediately retorted that this person cultivated the inscription Dao and could not be Lu Ming.</p><p>“Activate the heaven’s secrets instrument!”</p><p>In the end, the higher-ups of the Xie family issued an order.</p><p>The Xie family activated the heaven’s secrets instrument. Their target was Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, they activated the heaven’s secrets instrument and realized that Lu Ming was not in the holy city. He was still in Northern Plains.</p><p>In a secret room in the hundred beasts tribe in the Northern Plains, the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“It seems that the heaven’s secrets device also has a weakness. It can only find my main body, but not my secondary body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body ended its cultivation. He opened his eyes and smiled.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shouted softly. Four sealing gates appeared above his head and sealed the heaven’s secrets instrument projection. The heaven’s secrets instrument projection disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
