You’d better not use your bloodline to sense it, or you’ll only be asking for trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled wryly. The rest of the people had looks of respect on their faces.</p><p>...</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming was not the only one who sensed the aura in the snow Mountain ahead through his blood Meridian.</p><p>The disciples recruited by Dragon God Valley were all geniuses who had awakened the true dragon bloodline. They could easily sense each other.</p><p>The group continued to fly forward.</p><p>“It’s so cold!”</p><p>After flying into the huge Glacier Valley, the temperature dropped even more.</p><p>Moreover, the temperature was getting lower and lower as they went further in.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings as he flew.</p><p>The glacier Valley was huge. The walls on both sides were tens of thousands of feet high. On the walls, one could see houses and palaces carved out of ice.</p><p>However, most of them were cave abodes, which were excavated from the walls of the glacier.</p><p>Moreover, on both sides of the canyon, there were some side valleys. It was like a main vein that extended into some side valleys. Some people also lived in these side valleys.</p><p>After flying for more than ten minutes, the burly old man led them into a side valley. On both sides of the side valley, there were many cave abodes. At a glance, there were at least thousands of them.</p><p>Many of the cave abodes were already occupied.</p><p>As if sensing someone’s arrival, people walked out of some cave abodes. They were all very young and were of the same generation as Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“What a strong cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed the cultivation of these people and his pupils constricted.</p><p>Supreme martial artist. These young men were all Supreme martial artists.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was immediately relieved. The cultivation environment here was too good. It was many times better than the divine Ruins ‘continent group. Even a pig could cultivate to the martial King realm or even the third spiritual God Realm here, not to mention those peerless geniuses.</p><p>alright, you can stay here for the time being. The people here are the same as you, they are all newly selected disciples from the outer continent, but they came here two years earlier than you!</p><p>also, this entire Glacier Valley is only the outer Valley. You are not official disciples of Dragon God Valley yet. You can only be regarded as reserve disciples. Only by passing the assessment can you be considered as official disciples of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>there are still four months left before the assessment. During this period of time, all of you should focus on your cultivation. With your talent, it shouldn’t be too difficult for you to reach the zhizun realm in four months. Most of those who came here two years ago have already reached the zhizun realm!</p><p>let me tell you, there will be a huge opportunity in the assessment this time. Other people will be envious of it. The higher your cultivation, the greater the chance of obtaining the opportunity. So, you must grasp it and work hard!</p><p>The burly old man explained in detail.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. They were not official disciples yet. They were only reserve disciples. They had to pass an assessment before they could be considered official disciples.</p><p>The standards of the big sects in the yuanlu continent were really strict.</p><p>At this time, the burly old man waved his hand, and a Jade token appeared in his hand. On the token, an Ice Dragon was carved, and it was very lifelike.</p><p>The burly elder waved his hand and the Jade tokens flew toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming casually grabbed a token.</p><p>there is a number on this token, which represents the ice cave number you will be staying in. You can check in according to the number. Also, this token is also the identity token of your reserve disciples. Alright, you should get used to it and cultivate. I will come back after a while to explain the assessment in detail!</p><p>With that, the burly old man left.</p><p>Everyone followed the number on the Jade token to find the corresponding ice cave.</p><p>“Hello, brother!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to look for his cave abode, a crisp voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming turned to the side and saw a woman smiling at him.</p><p>The lady was dressed in a white dress. She had a sweet smile and fair skin. She was a rare beauty.</p><p>Behind the woman was a young man in a white shirt and holding a folding fan.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>He didn’t recognize these two people. They should be disciples who came here two years ago and had just walked out of the ice cave.</p><p>Since they didn’t know each other, why did the other party greet him?</p><p>“Hello!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded politely.</p><p>The young woman blinked and sized Lu Ming up carefully, seemingly very curious.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming would not be so narcissistic as to think that a beautiful woman would fall for him the moment he arrived.</p><p>“Little sister, what are you doing?”</p><p>Behind the woman, the man with the folding fan was also very curious.</p><p>“Your bloodline is very special!”</p><p>The woman suddenly said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned again.</p><p>brother, please don’t misunderstand. I am Qiu Ying Ying, and this is my elder brother, Qiu Hao. How should I address you? ”</p><p>The woman said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>brother Lu, my bloodline is rather unique. I’ve been sensing your bloodline for a while now, and I can feel that your bloodline has been suppressing mine. That’s why I’m curious and want to befriend you!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>So that was how it was!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the other party might have sensed his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the shadow of a true dragon appeared behind Qiu Ying Ying. It flashed past but Lu Ming could still see it clearly.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s true dragon bloodline was not a five-clawed true dragon, but a six-clawed one.</p><p>It was actually six-clawed.</p><p>It was said that all true dragons had five claws, and nine Dragons were a variant of the true dragon race, so they had nine claws.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not expect that there was a six-clawed true dragon in the world.</p><p>Perhaps, it was also a variant of the true dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Brother Lu, my bloodline is a bit special. It’s a variant of the true dragon species. I have six claws and am stronger than the average true dragon. You can suppress me?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying blinked her eyes and sized Lu Ming up carefully. She was extremely curious.</p><p>“My bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. As he spoke, the nine Dragon bloodline appeared behind him and he immediately kept it.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Nine … Nine Dragons, your bloodline is actually the legendary Nine Dragons? No wonder you can suppress me!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. There was nothing to hide about his nine Dragon bloodline. Once they started fighting, others would know immediately.</p><p>brother Lu, it’s your first time here. Have a good rest. My brother and I came here two years earlier. We’ll take you around in a few days!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said with a smile.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll thank you in advance!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and then found his ice cave and walked in.</p><p>At the entrance of the ice cave, there was an ice door. It was activated by a jade talisman and automatically closed.</p><p>The ice cave was very large and wide. It was at least 100 meters in length and width and 10 meters in height. There were ice tables, ice chairs, and even an ice bed.</p><p>The temperature here was extremely low, so there was no need to worry about these things melting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
