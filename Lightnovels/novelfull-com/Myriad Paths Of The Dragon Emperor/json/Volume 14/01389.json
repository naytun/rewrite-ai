At this time, he was running for his life. As his injuries worsened, his speed naturally became slower and slower.</p><p>“This won’t do. If this continues, this brat will catch up to me sooner or later. Now that I’m seriously injured, I don’t even have 1% of my strength left. I’m not his match at all …”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect was thinking of a way to escape.</p><p>Behind him, Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. His body was shrouded in a green light as he chased after the burly man from the heavenly God sect at an extreme speed.</p><p>He must kill the burly man of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The reason why he was chased by all the experts on the continent of the divine Ruins was all because of the burly man from the divine God sect.</p><p>First, there was news that Lu Ming had a mixed-essence token and could enter the core of the divine Ruins safely. Then, there was fake news that Dragon God Valley had been exterminated, so the experts of the continent group of the divine Ruins did not have any scruples about Lu Ming and went all out to hunt him down.</p><p>Later on, when Lu Ming set up a trap and killed a large number of experts from the continent of the divine Ruins, the burly man from the deity sect launched a sneak attack and seriously injured his second body. Now, even dandan and bubbles were unconscious.</p><p>Lu Ming had suffered a great loss.</p><p>Furthermore, with the actions of the burly man from the tianshen sect, if he was not killed, he would definitely seek revenge on Lu Ming in a frenzy. The divine wilderness continent, his family and friends would all be in danger.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had to kill the burly man from the divine God sect at all costs to get rid of future troubles.</p><p>The distance between the two of them was slowly closing.</p><p>no, this can’t go on. I can only give it my all!</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect had a ruthless look in his eyes. He suddenly changed his direction and flew toward the east.</p><p>“That is … The direction of the ancient city of the divine Ruins!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Originally, the location he had chosen before was in the central part of the divine Ruins continent, not far from the ancient city of the divine Ruins. This way, he could wait for the powerhouses of the four great divine palaces to appear at the same time.</p><p>this person, could it be that he wants to use the ancient city of the God ruins ‘teleportation array to escape back to the yuan continent’s tianshen sect? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>In fact, this was the case. The burly man from the Tian Shen sect could no longer care about his injuries. He wanted to use the teleportation array to escape back to the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>As long as he returned to the tianshen sect, he would be safe. In the future, when he recovered from his injuries, he would definitely return to the divine Ruins continent and kill all of Lu Ming’s friends and family, completely destroying the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect had a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“I won’t let you have your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were determined. More energy poured into the air-frozen bead. Lu Ming exerted the wind element technique to the extreme and his speed increased. The distance between him and the burly man from the deity sect was closing.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry!”</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect roared in his heart and tried his best to escape.</p><p>Soon, a huge ancient city appeared in front of them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two people, one in front and one behind, rushed into the ancient Divine Ruins city.</p><p>“What’s that? What a powerful fluctuation!”</p><p>that’s an Emperor. He’s so powerful. Who is he? ”</p><p>In the ancient city of the divine Ruins, some experts were alarmed, looking at the sky in shock.</p><p>In front of him, the 36 Tiangang peaks were in sight.</p><p>“We’re here, we’re almost here!”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect was shining with hope.</p><p>“Power, come!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming shouted angrily. An even stronger force from the air-frozen bead gushed into Lu Ming’s body. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The air-frozen bead contained a lot of power. Lu Ming could not withstand the influx of too much power and was injured by the force.</p><p>However, because of this, Lu Ming’s speed also increased greatly. He suddenly sped up and approached the burly man from the divine God sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword slashed down towards the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect was shocked. He quickly turned around and waved his sword to block.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect was sent flying, and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged. Lu Ming transformed into the prison-suppressing stele and suppressed the burly man from the heaven God sect.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect was hit by the prison-suppressing stele. His body was like a meteorite, crashing down heavily. He smashed a Phecda peak and his body almost cracked.</p><p>“The prison-guarding stele, why do you have the prison-guarding stele too? is this a bloodline? No, it’s the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele …”</p><p>The burly man from the heaven God sect struggled to get up. He looked at Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline and shouted in disbelief.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him. The prison-suppressing stele pressed down again.</p><p>This time, he had almost killed the burly man from the heavenly God sect. The burly man was extremely weak. The long sword in his hand had flown out. He no longer had the strength to resist.</p><p>“Spare me, spare me …”</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly Divine sect shouted in fear.</p><p>“Spare my life? When you wanted to kill me before, you didn’t show any mercy. If it wasn’t for my good luck, I would have died!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice came from the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled and emitted a cold killing intent. It was about to suppress the man from the Tian Shen sect once again.</p><p>wait a minute, Lu Ming. You’ve awakened the bloodline of the prison-guarding stele. If you can get the original body of the prison-guarding stele, you’ll be like a tiger that has grown wings.</p><p>The burly man from the heavenly God sect suddenly shouted.</p><p>“You know the true form of the prison-guarding stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard as the prison-suppressing stele’s murderous intent was halted.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was moved, the burly man from the heavenly God sect was overjoyed. that’s right. It’s said that the prison-guarding stele was broken by someone in the distant past. It was broken into several pieces and scattered all over the world. I know a piece of the prison-guarding stele fragment is in the tianshen sect!</p><p>“The heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“That’s right. As long as you promise to let me go, I will definitely find a way to help you steal the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele when I return to the divine sect.”</p><p>The heavenly deity burly man cried out. However, a scheme was brewing in his heart.</p><p>hehe, do you think I will believe you? the fragment of the prison-guarding stele is a treasure that the tianshen sect will definitely protect. With your cultivation, you are definitely not a high-level figure in the tianshen sect. How could you have obtained the fragment of the prison-guarding stele? do you think I am so easy to fool? ”</p><p>even if the tianshen sect really has the fragment of the prison-guarding stele, I will get it myself in the future. So, you should just die!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard and he was about to kill the burly man from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, one of the nine ancient altars in the sky suddenly shone with a dazzling light.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The altar was glowing, which meant that people from the major sects of the yuanlu continent were coming.</p><p>Wasn’t there still half a month to the two-year agreement with the major sects of the yuanlu continent? Could it be that the big sects of the yuanlu continent had come in advance?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the first altar lit up, the second altar lit up as well, and then the third.</p><p>A total of three altars lit up. Then, a space gate appeared, and two figures appeared on each of the three altars.</p><p>“The people of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of the people on one of the altars. It was a white-haired elder. He was the white-haired elder from the heavenly God sect that he had met when they were selecting disciples.</p><p>Behind the white-haired elder was a young man whom he had never seen before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
