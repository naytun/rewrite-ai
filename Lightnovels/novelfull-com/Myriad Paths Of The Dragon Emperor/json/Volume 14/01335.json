The nine inscription scrolls landed on the nine dragon veins. The endless inscriptions seemed to be alive as they filled the Dragon veins, temporarily suppressing them.</p><p>The nine dragon veins were temporarily calm.</p><p>According to the ancient legends, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was refined by an ancient expert to suppress the nine dragon veins. If the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had been gone for too long, the nine dragon veins would definitely go berserk.</p><p>Lu Ming had already expected this. Hence, he had asked his clone to refine nine inscription scrolls to suppress the nine dragon veins. Although it could only be suppressed for a few days, a few days was enough.</p><p>After the Dragon veins had calmed down, Lu Ming kept the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. He took a step forward and appeared outside ninedragons in the next moment.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>The old Dean of the Tianxia Academy shouted. With the help of the other Supreme martial artists, a wizardry barrier appeared outside ninedragons.</p><p>This layer of enchantment was used to block the voice transmission jade talisman, so that Di Yi would not know that Lu Ming had come here to take the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>After setting up the barrier, they set off with Lu Ming. Not long after, they used the inter-territory teleportation formation and returned to Northern Plains.</p><p>“Let’s go to the holy city!”</p><p>With an order, one figure after another tore through space and headed for the sacred city.</p><p>At the same time, the cultivators of the heaven suppressing divine Army also set off for the sacred city.</p><p>……</p><p>The sacred city was bustling with noise and excitement.</p><p>In the sky above the sacred city, multicolored light shone for tens of thousands of Zhang. A platform emerged from the void. On it, real Dragons, divine phoenixes, and Qilin were dancing.</p><p>This was the platform that the Xie clan had used during their million-year sacrificial ceremony. Now that it was being used again, it was clear how much importance the Xie clan placed on this Alliance ceremony.</p><p>“The sage Emperor has arrived!”</p><p>A voice spread out, spreading throughout the entire sacred city.</p><p>From the depths of the palace, figures flew out.</p><p>The one leading them was the current Sage Emperor, Xie Qitian.</p><p>Beside Xie Qitian was a white-haired old man. He was the previous generation’s old divine Emperor. In addition, there were more than a dozen people, all of whom had powerful auras. They were all emperors.</p><p>A small portion belonged to the Xie family, while the rest belonged to the Xie family’s Alliance and the emperors of other overlords.</p><p>Many experts descended onto the platform.</p><p>“Martial Emperor Di Yi and the other sovereigns of the Ditian divine Palace have arrived!”</p><p>Another shout rang out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>A group of experts flew over from afar and landed on the platform.</p><p>The one in the lead was Di Yi and Martial Emperor. Beside him were two elders. One of them was wearing a golden robe. He was the peak Lv 2 Martial Emperor realm expert who had appeared in the Tianxia Academy last time.</p><p>The other old man was wearing a long red robe. His aura was not any weaker than the Golden-robed old man.</p><p>Behind them were a group of emperors, more than ten of them.</p><p>Welcome, brother Di Yi!</p><p>Xie Qitian laughed and stepped forward to salute Di Yi.</p><p>“Thank you, brother!”</p><p>Di Yi returned the bow.</p><p>alright, since everyone is here, let’s begin the ceremony. First, we’ll pay our respects to the flag. Someone, bring Xia Jiuyang, Bai Shijin, and the others here!</p><p>Xie Qitian ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>yes, Your Majesty! an Emperor received the order and led a group of people, about 50 of them, towards the North.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming silently followed the group of people and headed north.</p><p>The entrance to the abyss Demon Realm was to the North of the holy city, which was a distance away.</p><p>After a while, they left the center of the holy city and were about to reach the entrance of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>At this moment, runes appeared on Lu Ming’s body. His figure seemed to have disappeared, and there was no aura at all.</p><p>Without a sound, Lu Ming appeared next to the person at the back. With a wave of his hand, the person did not even have time to react before he was stored into Lu Ming’s mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s body squirmed rapidly and became exactly the same as the person.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Emperor at the front seemed to have sensed something and turned around. However, he did not discover anything after a quick glance.</p><p>“Strange, there was clearly some fluctuation just now?”</p><p>The Emperor frowned and scanned the crowd with his spiritual sense, but he found nothing in the end. He could only give up and continue flying forward.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He had finally sneaked in without anyone knowing.</p><p>This was also the Dao of inscription that Lu Ming had mastered. It was extremely mysterious. At the same time, he had the help of the mountain and river diagram, a treasure. Otherwise, he would not have succeeded.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to secretly replace a pillar under the eyes of an Emperor.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the entrance of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>With the Emperor leading the way, they naturally entered the abyss Demon Realm smoothly.</p><p>Looking at the familiar environment, Lu Ming sighed. He did not expect to come to the abyss demonic realm again not long after.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang and the others have been suppressed by the nine Underworlds demon flame, and their cultivation has been sealed. They can’t fight back, but we still have to be careful. These people are not simple!</p><p>The leader warned. He had a horse-like face and Lu Ming had never seen him before. However, he was obviously the leader of the Xie family.</p><p>The Xie family indeed had a deep foundation. In the beginning, the Xie family had only announced Three Sovereigns to the public. However, it was obvious that they had more than that. No one knew how many more sovereigns they had hidden in secret.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The others responded.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor nodded and led the group toward the depths of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>Along the way, the horse-faced Emperor’s Emperor aura was released. When The Fiend clan members sensed it, they were almost scared to death and fled far away.</p><p>Soon, they were hundreds of millions of miles deep into the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>In front of him, a blazing heat spread out. It was a volcano.</p><p>This wasn’t an ordinary volcano or flame. It wasn’t an ordinary flame. It was the nine Underworlds demon flame.</p><p>When they stopped above the volcano, Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a strong murderous intent.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming noticed a figure in every volcano.</p><p>Lu Ming was familiar with the figures of the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, du songjue …</p><p>There were a total of five people. Besides the nine suns Supreme, the other four were all Supreme martial artists of the talisman sect.</p><p>The five of them were each suppressed in a volcano. Their bodies were bound by chains and suspended in mid-air. Within the volcano, the pitch-black nine nether demonic flame danced and burned the five of them at all times.</p><p>This kind of nine Underworlds demon flame wouldn’t burn people to death immediately, but it could bring them endless pain.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultivation of the five of them had been sealed, and they could not use their cultivation to resist.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were as cold as a knife.</p><p>“Xia Jiuyang, today is the day you die!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor looked down at Xia Jiuyang and the others with a disdainful expression.</p><p>“Oh, really? The Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace won’t be arrogant for long. When Lu Ming returns, it will be the time of your death!”</p><p>In a volcano, Xia Jiuyang raised his head and looked at the sky. His cold voice came out.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Hehe!”</p><p>The horse-faced Emperor sneered and said in a disdainful voice, ” “I might as well tell you that Lu Ming has returned!”</p><p>“What? Lu Ming is back?”</p><p>“Really? Zongzi is back?”</p><p>From the other volcanoes, there were sounds of surprise. It was the voices of Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
