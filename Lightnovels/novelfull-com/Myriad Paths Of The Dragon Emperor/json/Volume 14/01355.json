They were completely dumbstruck as they stood there in a daze, their eyes as big as chicken eggs.</p><p>...</p><p>The two black-robed men trembled uncontrollably as if they were sieves.</p><p>In their eyes, such a technique was like a legend.</p><p>In fact, such a method was nothing to an Emperor.</p><p>Any ordinary Emperor could cross billions of miles to kill an enemy.</p><p>However, the further the distance, the less powerful it would be.</p><p>Ordinary sovereigns could cross the void to kill their enemies, and even Supreme-beings would not be able to deal with them. Therefore, ordinary sovereigns would not do this when they encountered a powerful enemy.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, it was a piece of cake for him to annihilate a sect that only had a spiritual God Realm cultivator across hundreds of millions of miles.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not kill the blood Ridge sect’s martial artists with lower cultivation. The ones he killed were all above the sea of soul realm.</p><p>Thousands of powerhouses were turned into ashes by Lu Ming’s palm, including the spiritual God powerhouse who was the leader.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of blood-red light shot into the sky from the blood Ridge sect and fled into the distance.</p><p>blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall, so you’re the one behind this!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he shouted coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the beam of blood-red light from the blood Ridge sect was the blood Emperor from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Back when cold-blood Hall attacked the floating mountain, he led his men to rescue the floating mountain and besieged cold-blood Hall. The blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall was severely injured by Mo Ye and Martial Emperor Yuexin, and only the spiritual God managed to escape.</p><p>During this period of time, the blood Emperor had not appeared. Lu Ming thought that the blood Emperor’s spiritual God had dissipated and his body and soul had been destroyed. He did not expect that the blood Emperor’s spiritual God would possess a body in a remote place like the East barren. Until now, his cultivation had just recovered to the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>He was the one controlling the blood Ridge sect from behind the scenes and plundering treasures from all over the place in order to help him recover.</p><p>“You want to leave? where to?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed. He took a step forward and rushed into the void passageway. At the same time, he waved his hand and a Phoenix Feather flying sword flew out. It appeared on the other side of the void passageway in an instant and slashed at the blood Emperor.</p><p>The blood Emperor let out an unreconciled scream as he was cut in half by the Phoenix Feather flying sword. He died on the spot.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He kept the Phoenix Feather flying sword and returned from the void passageway. It entered the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows. Lu Ming waved his hand and the space crack disappeared.</p><p>However, mu Tian and the others still had not recovered from their shock. They stood there in a daze.</p><p>The series of events just now was simply too shocking.</p><p>Was this the technique of the divine wilderness continent’s peak experts? Was this the means of an Emperor?</p><p>It was like a legend.</p><p>Some people even felt a chill run down their spines. Such a method was truly inconceivable. No wonder everyone was so respectful to the Emperor and did not dare to show the slightest disrespect.</p><p>That was because if you offended an Emperor, the Emperor could kill you from hundreds of millions of miles away.</p><p>After a long while, mu Tian and the rest came to their senses. When they looked at Lu Ming, their eyes were filled with deep respect. This was respect for power.</p><p>“Alliance … Alliance master, I … We already said that we can … Can you spare my dog life?”</p><p>One of the black-robed men said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“Did I promise to let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. With a wave of his hand, the two black-robed men and the experts who had come to attack Tianxuan city were turned into ashes in an instant.</p><p>“It seems that I have to take down these small sects as soon as possible!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Now that the Overlord forces had been destroyed, the small forces under them would definitely be in chaos and start fighting.</p><p>Only by taking them down as soon as possible and tidying them up could they avoid unnecessary killing.</p><p>“Oh right, where’s Senior Sister Mu Lan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“LAN ‘er …”</p><p>Mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the others looked around but did not see Mu Lan. For a moment, they stammered and did not know what to say.</p><p>“Is Senior Sister Mu Lan not here? Then forget it!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Mu Tian and the others sighed in their hearts.</p><p>“Seniors, Lu Ming still has something to do and has to rush to ninedragons. If you want to leave the Tianxuan region and move to the central continent in the future, feel free to send someone to inform me.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We’ve lived in the Tianxuan region for our entire lives and are used to it. We appreciate Alliance master’s good intentions!”</p><p>Mu Tian said. He had unconsciously changed the way he addressed her.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed it too. He sighed in his heart but did not say much.</p><p>Now, he was no longer the Lu Ming of the past, the teenager. He was now the noble leader of the Dragon Alliance and had dominated the world. Mu Tian and the others had changed their attitude towards him and were respectful of him. This was something that could not be helped.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bade farewell to mu Tian and the rest and headed to ninedragons.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, a figure flew out of a Pavilion in Tianxuan city. It was Mu Lan.</p><p>“LAN ‘er, why didn’t you come out to meet me just now?”</p><p>Mu Tian asked.</p><p>Mu Lan looked in the direction that Lu Ming had left in. Her eyes were filled with longing, but there were more complicated emotions in them.</p><p>my talent is far inferior to Lu Ming’s. As time passes, the gap between us will only grow wider and wider. He and I are people from two different worlds!</p><p>Mu Lan sighed.</p><p>Mu Tian, mu Zheng, and the others also sighed.</p><p>even if I come out and stay by his side, what’s the use? we can’t grow old together!</p><p>Mu Lan continued.</p><p>That’s right, her current cultivation was only at the spiritual ocean tier. She was very clear about her own talent. In this lifetime, the spirit embryo realm was her limit. She had almost no hope of reaching the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>However, a spirit embryo realm cultivator’s lifespan was only three thousand years.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had a long lifespan. Even emperors could live for ten to twenty thousand years. If Lu Ming’s cultivation level improved, his lifespan would be even longer.</p><p>Even if she got together with Lu Ming, they would not be able to spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>“Moreover, the person in Lu Ming’s heart is not me!”</p><p>In the end, Mu Lan let out a long sigh before she turned around and returned to Tianxuan city.</p><p>Back then, Mu Lan had entered a secluded sect to cultivate in hopes of catching up to Lu Ming. However, she realized that the distance between them was growing further and further.</p><p>It was so far that she could no longer catch up.</p><p>In the end, all the friendship he had turned into a long sigh.</p><p>AI!</p><p>Mu Lan was not the only one sighing.</p><p>Hundreds of millions of miles away from Tianxuan city, Lu Ming stood in the sky and sighed.</p><p>Mu Lan was in Tianxuan city, so he had naturally discovered her long ago.</p><p>However, how could he not guess Mu Lan’s thoughts?</p><p>In that situation, he could only play dumb.</p><p>Otherwise, what could he do even if he met Mu Lan?</p><p>How should they get along?</p><p>Lu Ming could only suppress the ignorant friendship he had when he was young.</p><p>He took a step forward and the space cracked open. Lu Ming disappeared into the space Channel.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to ninedragons, he sped up the integration of the small forces and sects.</p><p>Wherever the Dragon Alliance went, those small forces and sects naturally surrendered and joined the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Even if there were some obstacles, they would be suppressed by the lightning.</p><p>The Dragon Alliance had officially infiltrated every corner of the divine wilderness continent and ruled the world.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not know that a crisis was approaching him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
