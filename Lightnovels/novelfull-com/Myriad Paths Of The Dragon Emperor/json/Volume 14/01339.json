Some of them used their spiritual senses to scan the surroundings and realized that the two Lu Mings had the same aura. The only difference was that one of the Lu Mings had a martial aura.</p><p>The other one was the Dao of inscription.</p><p>Two Lu Mings. What was going on? How was this possible?</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded. They looked at this and that.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you. It seems like you were the one who caused a ruckus in the drunken immortal garden last time!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s eyes narrowed as he spoke.</p><p>There were countless wonderful techniques in the world. Perhaps Lu Ming had cultivated Some Kind of Wonderful technique, which was why he had two of them. It was similar to a clone technique.</p><p>Di Yi was the calmest. He had long guessed that Lu Ming had a similar secret skill.</p><p>Back then, he had clearly sensed that Lu Ming was in the talisman Amulet sect. However, in the end, Lu Ming had appeared in the central continent’s celestial capital. It was also because of this that he made the wrong judgment and gave Lu Ming a few more years to cultivate. Otherwise, Lu Ming would not have grown to this stage.</p><p>“Who else could it be besides me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>A murderous look flashed in Xie Qitian’s eyes. Many elites had died in the drunken immortal garden. Even Xie Zhen had become an idiot. He had been hunting for the murderer for the past few days, but he did not expect that the murderer was Lu Ming. He had even sneaked into the abyss demon territory and saved Xia Jiuyang and the others.</p><p>His gaze swept past Lu Ming and landed on Xie nianqing. Xie Qitian’s gaze turned even colder.</p><p>“Xie nianqing, you still dare to appear here? You’re a traitor of the Xie family, yet you still dare to help outsiders to deal with the Xie family!”</p><p>A person walked out from the platform and shouted at Xie nianqing.</p><p>This person was Xie Qitian’s younger brother, Xie Qi Yu.</p><p>“Hehe, rebellious? Help outsiders? It’s ridiculous, the Xie family has treated me like this, I have no relationship with the Xie family, in my opinion, the Xie family is an outsider!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sneered and looked at Xie qiyu with a hint of mockery.</p><p>how dare you, Xie nianqing. Let me tell you, you are a member of the Xie family, and you will be a ghost of the Xie family in your death. You will obey the orders of the Xie family for all eternity. If you don’t, you will be betraying your ancestors. Everyone will punish you!</p><p>Xie qiyu shouted.</p><p>haha, this is ridiculous, ridiculous, and shameless!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed from the side. He glanced disdainfully at the people of the Xie clan and said,”According to your logic, even if you are bullied, you can’t resist? And be obedient? “That’s because you have a slave nature in you. When you meet a strong person, you can only be a slave. Such a family is rotten to the core. What do you want them for? Why don’t we just destroy it!”</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Many members of the Xie clan changed their expressions and glared at Xie Luan, but no one dared to speak.</p><p>Xie qiyu’s face was cold, but he didn’t dare to speak in front of Xie Luan. He could only turn his attention to Xie nianqing and shout, ” Xie nianqing, your father is right here, and your elders. If you don’t kowtow and admit your mistake now, maybe I can spare your life!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>As soon as Xie qiyu finished speaking, Xie nianqing stepped forward. Her Lotus-like feet stepped in the air, making a loud sound.</p><p>Xie nianqing landed on the platform and said, ” “I’m right here. If you have the ability, you can send people to capture me!”</p><p>This could be considered a challenge.</p><p>Xie nianqing is challenging the Xie family!</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Everyone from the Xie clan was silent.</p><p>Send someone to take down Xie nianqing, but who? Xie nianqing was a member of the younger generation. They couldn’t just send an old man who had cultivated for thousands of years.</p><p>However, among the younger generation of the Xie family, who could be a match for Xie nianqing?</p><p>In the past, there was Xie nianjun, but now Xie nianjun was not here.</p><p>After a long time, no one made a move.</p><p>there’s no need for the younger generation. No matter who they are, they can attack!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was heard.</p><p>No matter what generation they were, they could attack!</p><p>His words were like a slap to the faces of the Xie family.</p><p>This was undoubtedly a form of irony. A person who was regarded as an outsider and a traitor by the Xie family was invincible among the younger generation. There was not even a single person who could be sent out.</p><p>This caused the faces of many people from the Xie clan to burn.</p><p>this stinky girl, she’s doing this on purpose. She’s deliberately embarrassing the Xie family!</p><p>Xie qiyu roared in his heart.</p><p>“Xie nianqing, I’m here to get you!”</p><p>A tall and strong man stepped out.</p><p>This person looked like he was almost forty years old. In fact, he was already in his fifties or sixties, two generations older than Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The man landed in front of Xie nianqing, and a powerful aura burst out of his body.</p><p>Eighth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>“Xie nianqing, surrender!”</p><p>The brawny man reached out his hand, and his vast vital essence condensed into a huge hand that grabbed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Since you’ve made a move, you should be prepared to be killed!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was as cold as her eyes.</p><p>She pressed forward with her Jade-like hand.</p><p>The sky demon force field pressed down on the brawny man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The brawny man didn’t even have time to scream before his body suddenly exploded. Then, in the sky demon power field, he turned into ashes and dust.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>One move and he had instantly killed an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>He had turned an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert into ashes in one move.</p><p>What powerful strength.</p><p>The scene was filled with powerhouses. Any Supreme-being or Emperor could easily do this, but Xie nianqing was only in his twenties.</p><p>Xie nianqing had always been with Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s performance was too dazzling, causing everyone to ignore Xie nianqing’s existence.</p><p>However, at this moment, everyone had to re-examine Xie nianqing.</p><p>There were only a few people in ancient times who could turn an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert into ashes with one move at this age.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? He’s just a mutant!”</p><p>In the crowd, Xie Yan, Xie nianlin, and the other Xie clan elites were all pale.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s move dealt the biggest blow to the younger generation of the Xie family.</p><p>In the past, Xie nianqing was just an anomaly in their eyes. But now, he had far surpassed them.</p><p>They found it hard to bear.</p><p>“Xie clan, who else wants to make a move?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>The Xie family was silent.</p><p>Who else is going to make a move?</p><p>To be able to turn an eighth level spiritual God into ashes in one move, Xie nianqing’s combat strength was at least at the perfected spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Could it be that the Xie clan had to send out a Supreme martial artist to deal with a junior?</p><p>how audacious, impudent, and ruthless! You killed your own kind. I must teach you a good lesson today!</p><p>With a loud shout, Xie qiyu stepped forward and his Supreme aura pressed down on Xie nianqing.</p><p>hehe, a Supreme martial artist who has cultivated for thousands of years attacked a junior, and he even said it so arrogantly. How shameless!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his voice was heard from afar.</p><p>Xie qiyu’s face was burning. He could not be bothered with Lu Ming’s words and walked towards Xie nianqing step by step.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Suddenly, Xie qiyu shouted as his aura burst out, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed down on Xie nianqing.</p><p>This was the pressure of a Supreme martial artist. Not many people in the younger generation could resist it. They had to kneel down under this pressure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
