They felt that they had no hope of being killed by this sword.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>In the White jade Palace, Kong Xin and the others, as well as Xie Luan and the others in the North, were also on edge, especially Xie Luan, who was ready to help at any time.</p><p>the combat strength of a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm is indeed amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. The nine Dragons twisted their bodies, opened their mouths, and roared. The devouring power burst forth, shrouding the front. At the same time, the Dragon claws reached out, and the shadow of the prison suppressing stele appeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, it clashed with the golden sword light, and a terrifying explosion rang out in the sky.</p><p>The shadow of the prison-suppressing stele was destroyed by the golden sword light, but the golden sword light also collapsed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine Dragons and di hongcheng retreated at the same time. This time, di hongcheng’s retreat was shorter, while Lu Ming’s retreat was longer. The nine Dragons ‘bodies trembled slightly, and they were covered with sword marks.</p><p>The bodies of the nine Dragons glowed with light. Their bodies seemed to no longer be solid, and they seemed illusory.</p><p>you haven’t become an Emperor, and you haven’t cultivated a spiritual body. There’s still a limit to just relying on the power of your bloodline. Let’s see how you’re going to fight me.</p><p>Di hongcheng sneered, his eyes cold.</p><p>After all, there was a limit to the power of bloodline fusion. The more intense the resistance, the more terrifying the power of bloodline would be consumed. Once the power of bloodline was used up, he could no longer maintain the state of bloodline fusion. He could only wait for his power of bloodline to recover before he could use bloodline fusion again.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming’s power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline was about to be exhausted, so the bodies of the nine Dragons were somewhat illusory.</p><p>“This move will kill you!”</p><p>Di hongcheng stepped forward, and the golden sword light was even more dazzling.</p><p>Emperor sword, breaking the world!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The golden sword gleam slashed at Lu Ming again, full of murderous intent.</p><p>Di hongcheng was going to kill Lu Ming with this sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons burst like a bubble. However, Lu Ming’s actual body did not appear. Instead, a stone tablet appeared. It was the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele turned into the size of a mountain, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>Below him, the word on the stele shone with a resplendent light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-guarding stele was covered in a layer of chaos intent, which made it seem even heavier and more suppressive.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed toward the golden sword light.</p><p>the second divine level ninth rank bloodline!</p><p>Di hongcheng’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele clashed with the golden sword radiance.</p><p>The lower part of the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline was a physical body that was indestructible and firm.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled and flew backward. The golden sword light also collapsed instantly. Di hongcheng also retreated rapidly under the impact of the counterattack.</p><p>This time, di hongcheng retreated even further, further than Lu Ming.</p><p>This made di hongcheng’s face turn extremely ugly.</p><p>the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele contains the original body. It is indeed more powerful than the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, di hongcheng’s body seemed to have turned into a golden sword light, breaking through the void and approaching Lu Ming at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice came from the prison-guarding stele. The prison-guarding stele glowed and rushed toward di hongcheng.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Heaven and earth exploded. The two figures retreated and then charged together again.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, only two light figures could be seen constantly attacking and fighting. In the sky, there were constant explosions. The shockwaves formed by the two’s battle were getting more and more terrifying, causing the onlookers to retreat further and further away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had the upper hand, it was just a slight advantage. He could not win against his opponent in a short time.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Di hongcheng roared in his heart. He was a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert, but he couldn’t even take down a young man in the spiritual God Realm. He felt humiliated.</p><p>“Go to hell, Emperor sword!”</p><p>Suddenly, di hongcheng roared as a golden combat sword appeared above his head. This combat sword wasn’t formed by true essence, but a real combat sword, a real spirit weapon.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>It was an Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>Di hongcheng held the Golden combat sword in his hand, and a terrifying sword Qi was slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>an Emperor spiritual weapon! What a terrifying power!</p><p>Facing this sword, Lu Ming’s heart could not help but tremble.</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon was the Emperor of spiritual weapons. It was originally a weapon used by a peak Emperor, and only a peak Emperor could fully unleash the power of an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Supreme martial artists and even low-level emperors could not unleash the full power of an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Therefore, the higher one’s cultivation was, the more powerful the Emperor spiritual weapon would be.</p><p>A second level Martial Emperor using an Emperor spiritual weapon would naturally be more powerful than a first level Martial Emperor.</p><p>This sword gave Lu Ming a feeling of extreme danger.</p><p>“Power, power!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. More energy from his third bloodline surged into his body, filling his heart with killing intent. However, he could not care less at this moment.</p><p>The power of the third bloodline and the chaos will covered the prison-guarding stele, making it more powerful than ever.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The golden sword light hit the prison-suppressing stele. The stele shook violently and was sent flying like a meteorite, creating a big hole in the space.</p><p>On it, the chaos will was almost shattered. The prison-suppressing stele kept buzzing and became transparent.</p><p>One move and the bloodline power of the prison-suppressing stele was about to be exhausted.</p><p>Di hongcheng’s combat strength had skyrocketed with the addition of his King spiritual weapon. Lu Ming was no match for him at all.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Di hongcheng charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Not good, attack!”</p><p>In the North, Xie Luan’s expression changed. He took a step forward and traveled ten thousand miles in an instant.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>A pitch-black demonic blade appeared in Xie Luan’s hand. Demonic Qi shot up into the sky, and the blade radiance sliced through the air.</p><p>A black blade light cut through the endless void and headed toward di hongcheng.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>The demonic blade in Xie Luan’s hand was also an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>Xie Luan had created chaos in the world back then, so he naturally had an Emperor spiritual weapon. He had hidden it in a secret place and had only taken it out a while ago.</p><p>Di hongcheng’s expression changed when he saw Xie Luan’s attack. He turned around and slashed his golden sword at Xie Luan, ignoring Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and were evenly matched.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie Luan charged towards di hongcheng. Di hongcheng had no choice but to fight Xie Luan.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long breath. A peak second level Martial Emperor with an Emperor spiritual weapon was too powerful. Lu Ming was not his match.</p><p>“Kill, kill this bunch of dogs!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Yan kuangtu, qu Luo, the Barbarian Emperor and the others had arrived, killing their way into the Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The mountain breaking Martial Emperor and the third underworld Emperor’s expressions changed drastically. There were only two of them, and they were completely outmatched.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor had his eyes on the mountain breaker Martial Emperor, while quluo had his eyes on the third underworld Emperor. Both of them started fighting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
