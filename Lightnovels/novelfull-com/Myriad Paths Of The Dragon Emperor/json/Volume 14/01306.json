A Jade card appeared in his hand and he handed it to Xie nianqing. Xiaoqing, this is the cultivation method for: pure spirit body. Take it and study it!</p><p>...</p><p>“The cultivation method of a pure spirit body? Is there really such a secret technique in this world?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with curiosity. He took the Jade tablet and looked at it carefully. After a while, Xie nianqing was amazed.</p><p>amazing, this is really amazing. If I can cultivate a pure spirit body, it will be much easier for me to break through to the Emperor realm in the future!</p><p>Xie nianqing sighed.</p><p>little Qing, we need to rush back to the divine wilderness continent. We will need some time. Use this time to comprehend it!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Mm, okay!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded, then entered the mountain and river diagram and began to comprehend the pure spirit body.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to sit cross-legged on the back of the Thunder Rhino Supreme. He took out a Jade bottle, and his nine Dragon bloodline appeared. He opened his mouth and sucked, swallowing the nine drops of Supreme blood essence in the Jade bottle and began to refine it.</p><p>Lu Ming had planned to travel by himself. However, he needed time now.</p><p>Refining the blood essence, cultivating the pure spirit body, and comprehending the five martial techniques of intent all required time.</p><p>According to the chaos Scripture, one could cultivate the chaos will martial technique, chaos sky-turning seal, only when the five martial techniques of creation, including the earth Aeon technique, were cultivated to the highest realm.</p><p>That was a martial technique of the chaos concept. It was terrifyingly powerful. Naturally, Lu Ming was looking forward to it.</p><p>Therefore, he might as well ask Supreme Thunder Rhino to hurry along so that Lu Ming could save time and cultivate various martial arts techniques and secret techniques.</p><p>The nine Dragons swallowed the nine drops of Supreme blood essence and began to refine it at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, refining nine drops of Supreme blood essence at the same time was not a problem at all. Moreover, the refining speed was much faster than before.</p><p>In just a few hours, the nine drops of Supreme blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>The eight golden chakras of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline glittered, but it had not advanced.</p><p>Lu Ming took out another nine drops of Supreme-being blood essence and began refining.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming focused on refining the blood essence. After refining one Supreme-being blood essence, he took out another.</p><p>After more than a day, Lu Ming had refined the blood essence of six Supremes. The prison-suppressing stele bloodline still had not advanced, but Lu Ming felt that it would be soon.</p><p>He took out the blood essence of the seventh Supreme martial artist. The nine Dragons opened their mouths, and nine drops of blood essence flew into their mouths.</p><p>The majestic power of blood essence was constantly transformed into bloodline power and integrated into the bloodline of the prison suppressing stele.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After a while, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele vibrated. A new chakra appeared on top of the original eight golden chakra.</p><p>His ninth Meridian cycle, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline, had finally advanced to divine level nine.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele gave off a bright light.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the aura emitted by the prison-suppressing stele bloodline had completely surpassed the nine Dragons bloodline.</p><p>it seems that the origin of the prison-suppressing stele is very shocking. It’s even more powerful than the nine Dragons!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that if he performed the blood fusion and transformed into the prison-suppressing stele, its power would be stronger than the nine Dragons.</p><p>the original form of the prison-suppressing stele must be a treasure beyond imagination. It’s a pity that I only have one piece. If I could get all of them, how powerful would it be? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery light and were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Since he had found a fragment of the prison-guarding stele, it meant that the other fragments were still in this world and there was a chance to find them.</p><p>Not long after, the energy of the blood essence was completely refined. Lu Ming kept the blood Meridian.</p><p>alright, my bloodline has reached the ninth rank of the divine level, which is the highest level. Now, it’s time to comprehend the pure spirit body!</p><p>Plop! Plop!</p><p>At this moment, two figures flew out from the ocean below and landed on Supreme Thunder Rhino’s body. They were dandan and bubbles.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were each holding a spiritual herb and gnawing on it.</p><p>level nine spirit medicine, water spirit ginseng!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The spiritual medicine that dandan and Paopao were eating was an upper Lv 9 spiritual medicine, water spirit ginseng.</p><p>Since a day ago, these two fellows had been diving into the ocean from time to time in search of natural treasures. They were having a great time eating.</p><p>In any case, bubbles had grasped the spacetime intent, so she wasn’t afraid of losing him. No matter how fast he ran, bubbles would still be able to keep up.</p><p>In a short while, the level nine spirit herb, water spirit ginseng, was finished by the two of them. Their bodies emitted a strong spirit herb aura.</p><p>Obviously, there were many other spirit herbs in their stomachs besides the water spirit ginseng.</p><p>The natural treasures in the ocean were indeed incomparable to those on land. There were more than ten times as many.</p><p>On the land, human warriors mined, but in the ocean, there were fewer human warriors. At most, some demonic beasts in the ocean would devour them, but there were also many remains.</p><p>The two guys ate happily.</p><p>“Little guy, we’ll continue later!”</p><p>Dandan squinted her eyes at bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles nodded repeatedly. Even the bubbles that she exhaled had a rich spirit herb aura.</p><p>“These two fellows …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then entered the mountain and river diagram. Only the mountain and river diagram remained on the back of the Thunder Rhino Supreme.</p><p>After entering the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming went to Xie nianqing’s side. Xie nianqing ended his cultivation after sensing Lu Ming’s aura.</p><p>“Little Qing, how’s your comprehension going?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>it’s alright. However, it’s easy to comprehend, but not so easy to cultivate. It’s even more difficult to completely master it!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He had already memorized the cultivation method of a pure spirit body. It was just as Xie nianqing had said, it was not easy to cultivate it successfully.</p><p>Cultivating a pure spirit body required a huge amount of raw gemstones as a Foundation because it required a huge amount of energy.</p><p>With a huge amount of energy as the foundation, it can allow the body to evolve and transcend the mortal body, having part of the power of the Spirit body.</p><p>This process couldn’t be achieved overnight. It required one to move forward step by step and fight steadily.</p><p>The two of them continued to study. Three days later, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of raw gemstones appeared beside him.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the cultivation technique of the pure spirit body. One could see strange lines appearing on his body. There were a total of 108 lines, which looked like meridians.</p><p>This was the special route of pure spirit bodies.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang …</p><p>With a shake of his essential core, a large pile of raw gemstones was shattered and turned into rolling original Qi. Lu Ming opened his mouth and inhaled the rolling original Qi. He began to temper his body according to the cultivation method of the pure spirit body.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The original Qi of at least one hundred thousand raw gemstones was swallowed by Lu Ming. It seeped into the depths of Lu Ming’s physical body following the cultivation method of the pure spirit body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body had already reached the peak of the ninth grade and had reached the limits of his physical body.</p><p>However, at this moment, it began to break through its limits and achieve evolution.</p><p>This was because the limit of a complete grade Nine’s physical body was the limit of a mortal body. Now, the mortal body had evolved into a spirit body.</p><p>As the original Qi seeped in and was absorbed, Lu Ming’s body began to transform.</p><p>A few hours later, the original Qi of one hundred thousand raw gemstones was completely refined. Lu Ming swallowed another one hundred thousand raw gemstones.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming devoured a total of one million raw gemstones. At this time, Lu Ming finally stopped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
