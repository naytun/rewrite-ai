The heaven suppressing divine Legion was indeed not simple. There was such a powerful person hiding in the dark. He had not appeared in the previous conquests.</p><p>...</p><p>If even the heaven suppressing divine Army was like this, how could the Xie family, which had a deeper Foundation, not have any hidden cards?</p><p>The old general of the heaven suppressing divine Army saluted Xie Luan first, then turned to Lu Ming with a warm smile. it’s true that every generation has its own talents. This old man is impressed by little brother Lu’s strength!</p><p>“You’re too kind, old general!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>chaotic sky Emperor, little brother Lu, I can give you a definite answer. The heaven suppressing divine Army will definitely participate in the battle seven days later!</p><p>The old general said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan were overjoyed.</p><p>The old General’s words meant that he had agreed to join forces with them seven days later and head to the sacred city to fight the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan.</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor and the other experts of the heaven suppressing divine Army were surprised, but they didn’t say anything.</p><p>They also understood that the heaven suppressing divine Army could not stay out of this battle.</p><p>If Northern Plains were defeated, heaven suppressing divine Army would not be able to escape the fate of being destroyed, this alliance with Northern Plains was their only chance.</p><p>alright, old general. Everyone, we’ll meet in seven days!</p><p>“See you in seven days!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan said their goodbyes and left.</p><p>The goal of this trip could be considered to be a complete success.</p><p>After returning to the hundred beasts tribe, Lu Ming continued to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Four days later, there were only three days left before the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan formed an alliance.</p><p>In a secret room, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and he stepped out of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s main body waved his hand and the mountain and river diagram flew to his clone, which then kept it.</p><p>Then, the main body closed his eyes, while the second body smiled.</p><p>“Let’s go to the holy city first!”</p><p>The second body smiled, took a step forward, and disappeared.</p><p>After a while, the second body had already appeared hundreds of millions of li away from the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming’s plan was to let the second clone enter the holy city first to inquire about the nine suns Supreme, Bai Shijin, and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind sank into the clone. The clone was just like his main body.</p><p>“Let’s change our appearance first!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a long gray robe and put it on. At the same time, his figure and face began to change. Finally, he turned into a young man with a sallow face.</p><p>His appearance was very ordinary, the kind of appearance and body that would not be easily discovered in a crowd.</p><p>Then, runes appeared on Lu Ming’s body. He began to restrain his aura until he was only a seventh-rank Alchemist. Then, he took a step forward, and space cracked open. Lu Ming disappeared from the place.</p><p>He had refined his second body and reached the level of a ninth grade Emperor. His speed was extremely fast. In less than half a day, the holy city appeared in front of him.</p><p>There were experts guarding the city gates of the holy city. The checks were extremely strict. Everyone who entered had to go through a strict examination.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had inherited the legacy of the mysterious sky Saint and was proficient in the Dao of inscriptions. He had concealed himself with inscriptions and arrays, and even an Emperor would not be able to detect him.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the holy city easily.</p><p>“There are so many people!”</p><p>Walking on the streets of the holy city, Lu Ming realized that there were more people coming and going in the holy city than when he was in the past.</p><p>It was normal to think about it.</p><p>There were still a few days left before the Emperor heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan would hold the Alliance ceremony. Right now, the Xie clan and their allies had all entered the sacred city.</p><p>Also, many of the powers that the Emperor heaven divine Palace belonged to had also come to the sacred city. Naturally, the sacred city would be very lively.</p><p>this evening, the Xie family’s Xie Yan, Xie Zhen, and the other princes will be hosting a banquet at the drunken immortal court to welcome the southern nether’s peerless genius, Dark Child. At that time, all young geniuses are welcome to attend!</p><p>Lu Ming had just entered the holy city when he heard this piece of news.</p><p>“Dark Child!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>In the end, only dark Child, the unscrupulous monk, and the moonless female Bodhisattva had returned from the trip to the divine Ruins. However, Long Chen had not returned, and no one knew what had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming really wanted to know.</p><p>then the drunken immortal garden will definitely be very lively this evening. We can’t miss such a Grand scene!</p><p>indeed. Back then, 12 top geniuses went to the divine Ruins continent, but only three returned. Two of them were from the Western Desert, and the Western Desert’s Saint monk has always stayed out of it. In other words, Dark Child is the top genius now!</p><p>that’s right. In the future, Dark Child is destined to roam the divine wilderness. That’s why the Prince of the Xie family specially invited Dark Child to a banquet to curry favor with him!</p><p>Many people were discussing and Lu Ming had heard a lot of news.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a mocking smile and he strolled casually on the streets.</p><p>Very soon, it was evening and Lu Ming headed towards the drunken immortal garden.</p><p>The drunken immortal court was quite famous in the sacred city. The environment inside was elegant, and there was a place for experts to spar, so it became a gathering place for some martial arts experts.</p><p>At the entrance of the drunken immortal court, there were many young and outstanding people walking in and out.</p><p>At the main entrance, there were people checking, but they usually only checked casually before letting people in.</p><p>They entered the drunken immortal court and came to an empty space. The empty space was filled with tables and chairs, and many people had already taken their seats.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw many familiar faces.</p><p>Many of them were second and third-class geniuses from the Overlord forces.</p><p>Lu Ming saw more familiar figures on the platform at the top.</p><p>Xie Yan, Xie Zhen, and the other princes of the Xie family, as well as Wu chengkong, the heaven’s favorite of the heavenly martial sword sect.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming knew that the heavenly martial sword sect had already submitted to the Ditian divine Palace. Therefore, Wu chengkong and the others had also become members of the Ditian divine Palace.</p><p>“Dark child is here!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>In the distance, a black-robed young man with his hands behind his back was Walking in the Air.</p><p>He exuded a domineering aura that showed that he was the only one in the world. This person was dark Child.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie Yan, Xie Zhen, Wu chengkong, and the others quickly flew into the sky to welcome Dark Child.</p><p>“Haha, it’s my honor that brother Ming is willing to come!”</p><p>Xie Yan laughed heartily.</p><p>not bad, not bad. Brother Ming’s arrival is truly an honor!</p><p>Xie Zhen said, unwilling to be outdone.</p><p>Following that, the other heaven’s favorites started to flatter him.</p><p>Now, among the younger generation of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, including the Xie family, Ming Zi was the number one and the only giant-level heaven’s pride expert. His future achievements would be limitless, so they naturally had to firmly establish a relationship with him.</p><p>“En, everyone is too polite!”</p><p>Dark Child put his hands behind his back and spoke indifferently, looking like he was above everyone.</p><p>Xie Zhen and the others didn’t mind. They welcomed Dark Child to the platform and continued to flatter him.</p><p>Ming Zi pursed his lips and pretended to be calm, but he was actually enjoying it.</p><p>He enjoyed this feeling very much. He was intoxicated by the feeling of being surrounded by a myriad of stars.</p><p>In the past, he had been the center of attention, a giant-level prodigy of the divine wilderness continent, standing at the peak. But after all, there were more than ten people who could compete with him. His presence had undoubtedly weakened a lot.</p><p>But now, it was different. Everything was centered around him, and he was enjoying it too much.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
