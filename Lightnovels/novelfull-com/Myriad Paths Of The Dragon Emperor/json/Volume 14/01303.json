A bright spot of light appeared where the axe and the Dragon Claw collided, and a circle of ripples visible to the naked eye spread out.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>In the ocean below, huge waves rose up and rolled up to the sky. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>The space was completely annihilated, revealing a pitch-black space. The clouds in the sky instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Fortunately, the spectators were far enough away. Otherwise, no one below the Supreme-being realm would be able to survive this wave of energy.</p><p>Even so, such a horrifying scene still made many people shiver and retreat.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The place where the giant axe and the Dragon Claw met gave out a sizzling sound, and the Dragon Claw kept shaking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s attack was no match for the giant axe and was crushed. The Dragon Claw exploded and the nine Dragons ‘bodies were sent flying hundreds of miles away by a powerful force.</p><p>Fortunately, the nine Dragons were formed from Lu Ming’s bloodline power. After the Dragon Claw exploded, it immediately condensed again.</p><p>what a powerful force! An Emperor’s spiritual weapon is indeed not something that a Supreme martial artist can compare to!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was somewhat solemn.</p><p>Hai Yu’s Emperor spiritual weapon had made his combat strength reach the level of an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>However, the Emperor spiritual weapon used by the elder in the purple-gold robe was much more powerful.</p><p>“Lu Ming is no match for them!”</p><p>the emperor’s spiritual weapon is too powerful. Lu Ming is no match for it!</p><p>he’s finished. Is such a person going to die Here today? ”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm. Some were gloating, while others felt pity.</p><p>“Haha, I knew it. An Emperor using an Emperor spiritual weapon will completely suppress Lu Ming. Lu Ming, you want to fight me? go to hell!”</p><p>Hai Yu laughed, his eyes ferocious.</p><p>“It’s over, it’s over!”</p><p>In the distance, Supreme lightning rhinoceros continued to growl.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming had displayed his might and severely injured an Emperor, Supreme lightning rhinoceros had thought that he was dreaming.</p><p>It had only been a short while. When Lu Ming was fighting with him, he had to rely on the lightning cauldron and his pets to defeat and suppress him.</p><p>However, only a few months had passed and Lu Ming could defeat an Emperor with his own strength, let alone him. If Lu Ming wanted to kill him, he could probably do it with a slap.</p><p>Initially, he had already made up his mind to follow Lu Ming obediently in the future. With such a proud person, he might be able to benefit from this misfortune by becoming Lu Ming’s Mount.</p><p>However, when he saw that Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, his heart sank.</p><p>“What end? Lu Ming will not lose!”</p><p>Xie nianqing slapped Supreme Thunder Rhino on the head and scolded him.</p><p>She was very confident in Lu Ming. Moreover, she knew that Lu Ming had cultivated the legendary chaos will. Up until now, Lu Ming had not used the chaos will.</p><p>“He still won’t be defeated even after this?”</p><p>Supreme Thunder Rhino was skeptical.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe wielded his battle axe and swung it, splitting the space in half. The powerful force completely enveloped Lu Ming, making it impossible for him to escape.</p><p>let’s see how far I can go without using chaos intent!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Above his head, the Thunder cauldron appeared and turned into the size of a mountain. He rushed toward the battle-ax and, at the same time, used the nine Dragons steps and struck out with another claw. It was also a fusion of five martial arts techniques of intent.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Thunder cauldron was the first to be hit. It collided with the battle-ax and was sent flying. Lu Ming’s attack arrived and struck the battle-ax.</p><p>In the midst of the loud boom, Lu Ming retreated again. However, this time, he retreated a lot less than the previous time because the Thunder cauldron had offset a part of the power of the battle-ax.</p><p>“That’s all you got, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the lightning cauldron and attacked again.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the chaos will. Instead, he used the Thunder cauldron as a support and mainly used five types of martial arts techniques to engage in an intense battle with the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>In this way, although Lu Ming was still at a slight disadvantage, it would not be a one-sided battle and he would not be in a state of anxiety.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely, and the area within tens of thousands of miles became the battlefield of their battle.</p><p>In the ocean, huge waves were surging.</p><p>The island was swept by the terrifying force. It exploded and turned into ashes, disappearing from the sea.</p><p>In the sky far away, countless people stood there, staring at the battlefield with their eyes wide open. They held their breaths, not willing to miss a single thing.</p><p>Some Supreme martial artists ‘eyes were even shining as they stared at it.</p><p>It was rare for emperors to go all out in a life-and-death battle, and it gave them some inspiration.</p><p>Soon, the two of them exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>“Good, good, good, haha!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and burst out laughing.</p><p>In this battle, other than the chaos intent, he did not hold back at all. He used his full power and had a great time.</p><p>During this period of time, his progress had been too fast and his Foundation was somewhat unstable. After this battle, it could be considered to have completely stabilized and was as solid as a rock.</p><p>At the same time, during the battle, Lu Ming felt that his understanding of the five martial arts techniques of creation was getting deeper and deeper, as if he could make a breakthrough at any time.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was using them together. Once he broke through, all five types of martial arts techniques would break through and reach the fourth level.</p><p>The power of the five martial techniques of creation would undoubtedly increase again after they reached the fourth level.</p><p>damn it! How can a mere ant in the great circle of the spiritual God stage have such shocking battle prowess? ”</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked the elder in the purple-gold robe was.</p><p>this guy must be killed. Otherwise, there will be endless trouble in the future. I’ll just waste my time with him. As an Emperor, my true Yuan is definitely more powerful than his, and I’ll be able to last longer!</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe pondered. After making up his mind, he continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged over a dozen moves.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s Dragon Claw swiped out. Its power was much stronger than before.</p><p>haha, I’ve broken through! I’ve broken through the martial arts technique of creation!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After an intense battle, Lu Ming’s five martial arts techniques of creation finally broke through and entered the fourth level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In this exchange, Lu Ming retreated, but the elder in the purple-gold robe was also pushed back.</p><p>A draw!</p><p>Lu Ming had been at a disadvantage in the beginning. Now, with the help of the Thunder cauldron, he was on par with the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>“Ah, detestable!”</p><p>The purple-and-golden-robed elder naturally sensed Lu Ming’s breakthrough in his martial arts technique. He roared in his heart and was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>After an intense battle, not only did he not kill Lu Ming, but he also helped Lu Ming to break through his martial arts technique. How could this be? He only felt that there was a breath stuck in his chest, and it was so uncomfortable that he wanted to die.</p><p>How depressing!</p><p>Instead of killing Lu Ming, he had helped him.</p><p>haha, I really have to thank you. However, this battle should end here!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. A layer of misty aura spread out from his body, turning into the color of chaos.</p><p>The lightning cauldron trembled slightly and shrank rapidly, flying back to Lu Ming’s glabella and disappearing. At the same time, Lu Ming’s body shrank and returned to his human form.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the lightning cauldron and returned to his human form. He walked toward the elder in the purple-gold robe.</p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>The surrounding spectators were slightly dumbstruck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
