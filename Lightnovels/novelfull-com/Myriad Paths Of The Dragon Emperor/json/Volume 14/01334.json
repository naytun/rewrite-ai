Even his aura had changed. The Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace could not find him at all.</p><p>...</p><p>Not far from the entrance of the abyss Demon Realm, a dark-faced young man came.</p><p>The dark-faced teenager was Lu Ming.</p><p>“The security is even tighter now!”</p><p>Lu Ming was watching from afar.</p><p>The entrance to the abyss Demon Realm was more heavily guarded than before. Not only were there more inscription formations, but there were also more experts guarding it.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully and sensed the auras of many Supremes.</p><p>“If I barge in now, I’ll only alert the enemy. At that time, the Xie family and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace will attack with all their might and block me inside. Not only will I not be able to save senior Jiuyang and the others, but I’ll also be in danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>“On the day of the Alliance, they will definitely send someone to bring senior Jiuyang and the others out. That will be the best time!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming had an idea. His figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>Time passed by very quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was already the day the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace would form an alliance.</p><p>The sacred city was extremely lively. The experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan had all gathered here.</p><p>In the East barren, outside ninedragons, the space suddenly cracked open, and a figure stepped out.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>After a few years, Lu Ming was back in ninedragons again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure disappeared. The next moment, he appeared in ninedragons.</p><p>The defense of ninedragons was meaningless to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming strode in the void, the endless mountains and rivers of ninedragons flitting beneath his feet. Soon, he appeared in the depths of ninedragons, where the head of one of the Dragon veins was.</p><p>“The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron that was as tall as a mountain.</p><p>The purpose of his trip was the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron would definitely play a decisive role in this battle.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged, and they let out a long roar that shook the heavens.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron began to shake. A buzzing sound could be heard for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>“The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron is moving!”</p><p>“What’s going on? Why is the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, which hasn’t moved since the ancient times, moving again?”</p><p>The unusual movement of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron attracted the attention of the people nearby. One after another, figures crossed the void and flew over at high speed.</p><p>“What’s that? A Dragon?”</p><p>“Argh! That’s the nine Dragons! Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“What? Lu Ming dares to come here?”</p><p>When many people saw the nine Dragons, they roared in shock.</p><p>Some of them had experienced the war in ninedragons and were very familiar with Lu Ming’s nine Dragon bloodline. They recognized it at a glance and screamed in fear.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with those people. He controlled the nine Dragon bloodline with all his might and resonated with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook more and more violently. In the end, it rose from the ground and flew toward Lu Ming, hovering above his head.</p><p>“Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, come!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The nine Dragons wrapped around the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, and a mysterious aura rushed out in all directions.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The other Dragon’s Vein trembled violently. The second Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron moved and floated in the air, flying toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the third Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron also moved.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron broke through the air. In the blink of an eye, three Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were suspended above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare?”</p><p>“Put down the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!”</p><p>In the distance, a few howls sounded out as a few figures broke through the air.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, and as soon as his voice fell, his figure had already appeared above the Dragon vein.</p><p>the head of the Dongfang family, the head of the Kong family …</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>A few Supreme martial artists had come, and some of them were old acquaintances. They were the other family heads of the six great ancient families.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and continued to control the nine Dragon bloodline to summon the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Being ignored by Lu Ming, the few Supreme-beings ‘faces turned ugly.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artists looked at each other and reached a consensus.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A few rays of dazzling light burst out and shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The light was beautiful, but it was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold and he stepped into the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying power crushed the space and surged toward the Supreme-beings.</p><p>The attacks of the Supreme martial artists were as fragile as tofu in the face of this power.</p><p>Two of the Supreme martial artists ‘bodies even exploded and died on the spot.</p><p>As for the family heads of the three families, they were sent flying thousands of miles and crashed into a dozen mountains. Blood spurted from their mouths and their breathing became weak.</p><p>With a single strike, he had killed two Supreme martial artists and seriously injured the other three. Such battle prowess was extremely terrifying. In the distance, there was silence. No one dared to open their mouths.</p><p>Today, all the experts of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had gone to the sacred city. Not even a single Emperor was left behind. No one could stop Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is this Lu Ming’s combat strength?”</p><p>Among the crowd, there were some young sovereigns who were on the list of top 1000 talents in the eastern barren territory. Some of them had even competed with Lu Ming. At this moment, they were full of dejection and shock when they saw the figure on the Dragon vein.</p><p>Back then, they were of the same generation and they were competing with each other. However, in just a few years, the gap between them and Lu Ming was already huge. They could not be compared at all.</p><p>They knew that they would never be able to catch up to Lu Ming in this lifetime.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The roars of the nine Dragons shook the heavens.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook continuously. One after another, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>More and more Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Four, five, six …</p><p>“Quick, spread the news!”</p><p>Someone in ninedragons gave the order.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>One after another, voice transmission Jade talismans flew out.</p><p>However, as soon as they arrived outside ninedragons, a light screen rose up and blocked all the voice transmission Jade talismans.</p><p>A few figures were standing in the void outside ninedragons.</p><p>Among them, there was a Dean of the Tianxia Academy who cultivated the Dao of inscription. There were also seven or eight Supreme martial artists who cultivated the Dao of inscription. They had set up a wizardry barrier outside ninedragons to specifically intercept the voice transmission jade talisman.</p><p>More and more Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were summoned by Lu Ming. In the end, all nine divine cauldrons were gathered and suspended above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>I’ll lend it to you for a few days. After a few days, I’ll let you return to your original place!</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. The nine Dragons opened their mouths and swallowed. The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons flew into the big mouth of the nine-Dragon bloodline and disappeared.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, the nine dragon veins in ninedragons were stirred up. Like nine real Dragons, they were about to break through the sky and soar into the sky with Dragon Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as if he had expected this. He waved his hand and nine inscription talismans flew out from his storage ring.</p><p>The nine inscription scrolls flew through the air, each flying towards a dragon vein.</p><p>Then, the scroll expanded rapidly to the size of a mountain. On it, there were countless inscriptions shining.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
