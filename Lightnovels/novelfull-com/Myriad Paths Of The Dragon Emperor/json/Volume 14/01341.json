He was burning like a sun.</p><p>“Xia Jiuyang, do you want to fight with me? Hehe, although you’ve reached the martial Royal realm, you’re still far from being able to fight me!”</p><p>Di Yi smiled indifferently.</p><p>Di Yi, the moment you killed me, we had nothing to do with each other. I have paid you back, but you haven’t paid me back. We must fight. If we don’t fight today, we won’t have a chance in the future!</p><p>Xia Jiuyang said.</p><p>“No more chances in the future? Xia Jiuyang, you know your own limits. You know that you will die today!”</p><p>Di Yi sneered.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang shook his head. what I mean is that you are the one who will die today. That’s why we won’t have a chance to fight in the future! he said.</p><p>I’m the one who’s going to die. Hahaha! What a joke! Xia Jiuyang, since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>Di Yi laughed and stepped forward. Golden light burst out from his body, and the golden sword Qi was even more powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop him. He knew that there was a knot in Xia Jiuyang’s heart, which was Di Yi.</p><p>He and Di Yi had to fight, no matter if they won or lost. Otherwise, Xia Jiuyang’s knot in his heart would not be broken, and it would be difficult for him to make any further progress in his cultivation.</p><p>“Master, take the tower!”</p><p>Yan Kuang waved his hand, and the Emperor spirit tower flew toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang raised his hand and held the Emperor spirit tower in his hand. The Emperor spirit tower vibrated slightly, as if it had resonated with Xia Jiuyang. A circle of territory bloomed and combined with Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>The Emperor spirit tower was a fire-attribute Emperor spirit weapon. Xia Jiuyang had awakened the nine yang bloodline. Now that he had broken through to the Emperor level and cultivated the nine yang divine body, his entire body was covered in the divine fire of the sun.</p><p>As soon as the Emperor spirit tower was in Xia Jiuyang’s hands, it was connected to his mind and was controlled by him.</p><p>Of course, this was because Yan kuangtu could not control it. After all, the Emperor spirit tower was refined by Yan kuangtu first. If Yan kuangtu deliberately controlled it, Xia Jiuyang would not be able to use it.</p><p>“Xia Jiuyang, so what if you have another Emperor spiritual weapon? do you think you can fight me? Kill!”</p><p>Di Yi shouted coldly. His palm was like a sword. He struck down, and a golden sword light slashed toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>“Nine yang divine fist!”</p><p>An even more shocking flame burst out from Xia Jiuyang’s body, as if the sun was burning.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xia Jiuyang punched nine times in a row. Nine fist forces, like nine suns, shot toward Di Yi.</p><p>The golden sword light slashed down, and the nine sun-like fist forces were shattered one by one.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Emperor spirit tower shook and grew to the size of a mountain, crashing down on Di Yi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Di Yi’s sword Qi hit the Emperor spirit tower and collapsed.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang roared. His territory spread out and merged with the territory of the Emperor spirit tower. The power of the Emperor spirit tower was even stronger than when it was in Yan kuangtu’s hands. It smashed toward Di Yi again.</p><p>“The Emperor sword!”</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes were cold, and his sword Qi whistled. A golden sword Qi, like an Emperor’s sword, was released. It was filled with supreme majesty, as if everyone had to kneel down.</p><p>The power of this sword was shocking.</p><p>Di Yi began to show his strength at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword hit the Emperor spirit tower. The Emperor spirit tower shook violently and was sent flying by the sword radiance.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang’s body also trembled, and he took nine steps back.</p><p>After all, Xia Jiuyang’s cultivation was only at the first level of the martial Royal realm, and he had just broken through. He was far from Di Yi’s level. Even with the king spiritual weapon, he was no match for him.</p><p>“Emperor sword, break the world!”</p><p>The sword Qi soared into the sky and slashed down at Xia Jiuyang again.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang continued to block with the Emperor spirit tower.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword Qi struck the Emperor spirit tower, which shook even more violently and was sent flying.</p><p>“This sword will kill you!”</p><p>Di Yi’s cold voice rang out. He swung his sword at Xia Jiuyang’s head.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu turned pale with fright.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn, but he did not help.</p><p>Just as Di Yi’s sword Qi was about to hit Xia Jiuyang, a stone flew out from between Xia Jiuyang’s eyebrows. As soon as the stone flew out, Xia Jiuyang’s aura soared. He threw a punch and hit Di Yi’s sword light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the sword light was destroyed.</p><p>“That is … The divine Sun Stone?”</p><p>“It’s really the divine Sun Stone!”</p><p>Many sovereigns stared at the stone between Xia Jiuyang’s eyebrows and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile. Yes, the stone between Xia Jiuyang’s eyebrows was the divine Sun Stone.</p><p>Lu Ming had cut it out of the divine Ruins ‘ancient mine during the MU family’s stone gambling event back in the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>The divine Sun Stone was produced from the core of the sun, and it was seamless with Xia Jiuyang’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming had given the divine Sun Stone to Xia Jiuyang when they broke out of the abyss demonic realm.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang was very shocked. He wanted to reject it as it was too valuable. However, Lu Ming said that he would only accept it after this battle.</p><p>The divine Sun Stone was indeed a perfect match for Xia Jiuyang’s body constitution. Xia Jiuyang refined it slightly and it fused perfectly with him.</p><p>As soon as the divine Sun Stone appeared, Xia Jiuyang’s cultivation temporarily skyrocketed with the help of the divine Sun stone’s power, reaching the second level of the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes shone with a cold light. Like two sword lights, he stabbed at Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>“So what if you have the divine Sun Stone? you’ll still die!”</p><p>Di Yi’s voice rang out, and the sword Qi whistled, rushing toward Xia Jiuyang.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang controlled the Emperor spirit tower and smashed it at Di Yi.</p><p>“Nine yang divine fist!”</p><p>Xia Jiuyang roared. His body glowed, and then, nine suns emerged from his body.</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Xia Jiuyang rushed toward Di Yi, his fists constantly bombarding Di Yi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky was boiling as the two of them began a great battle. The scene was extremely shocking, and for a time, there was no clear winner.</p><p>“Heavens, he’s really too strong!”</p><p>“With such power, if it were to land on the ground, it would be able to pierce through the earth, right?”</p><p>In the sacred city, countless martial artists looked up at the sky, their eyes filled with deep shock.</p><p>The power of a martial Royal realm expert was already terrifying enough, not to mention a battle of Di Yi’s level.</p><p>The entire sacred city was glowing. Inscriptions appeared in every corner, forming a light screen. Occasionally, a powerful Qi would fall from above, but it would be blocked by the light screen.</p><p>Otherwise, the entire holy city would be destroyed.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang can actually fight with Martial Emperor Di Yi? ”</p><p>Some of the spectating sovereigns revealed expressions of shock.</p><p>Xia Jiuyang’s combat power was beyond imagination.</p><p>Even if Xia Jiuyang had an Emperor spiritual weapon, his cultivation was only at the early stage of the first level Martial Emperor realm. An ordinary Martial Emperor could not fight with Di Yi even if he controlled an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>But Xia Jiuyang had done it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
