This way, the Dragon Alliance and Lu Ming’s family and friends would be safe.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>This plan could be said to be very bold and dangerous.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing held Lu Ming’s hand tightly and stared into his eyes.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s smile was devastatingly beautiful.</p><p>Without further ado, Lu Ming gathered the higher-ups of the Dragon Alliance the next day and announced his idea.</p><p>In the beginning, Xie Luan, Xia Jiuyang, and the rest were strongly against it. But since Lu Ming had already made up his mind, they could not do anything about it.</p><p>After the meeting, Lu Ming and Xie Luan sat opposite each other in the backyard of the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>“Senior Xie, I don’t know when Lu Ming will be back. I’ll leave the Dragon Alliance to you for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Why do you say that, Alliance master?”</p><p>Xie Luan was taken aback.</p><p>there’s less than a year before the appointed date with the yuanlu sect, Dragon God Valley. If we delay our trip to the continent of the divine Ruins, I’m afraid it will take a year. When the messenger from Dragon God Valley arrives, he will probably have to leave for the yuanlu!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>Xie Luan fell silent. After a while, he said,”Alliance master, don’t worry. One day, I, Xie Luan, will ensure the safety of the Dragon Alliance and your family!”</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. I will never forget what I promised you. When I have a firm foothold in the yuanlu continent, I will definitely recommend you to join a big sect!</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Xie Luan solemnly raised his glass to Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming went to have dinner with Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.</p><p>The next day, Lu Ming brought Xie nianqing and officially set off for the divine Ruins.</p><p>In the Northern Plains, in the boundless ocean, Lu Ming looked at the divine wilderness continent in the distance, a complicated look in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t know how long it would take for him to return.</p><p>Xie nianqing stood quietly beside Lu Ming, not saying a word.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming smiled, held Xie nianqing’s hand, and turned to leave.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming only brought Xie nianqing and tu Qian. Lu Ming left him at the Lu family to guard the Lu family.</p><p>After flying for a while, Xie nianqing entered the mountains and rivers to cultivate while Lu Ming began to travel at full speed.</p><p>He had to get to the continent of the divine Ruins as soon as possible, or else things would change.</p><p>Lu Ming tore the space apart with all his might and his speed was shocking.</p><p>Traveling at full speed would consume a lot of energy. Even with Lu Ming’s current essential core strength, he would not be able to last long.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had a secondary body. When the main body’s essential core ran out, the main body would enter the mountain and river diagram to recover while the secondary body would continue on its journey.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current speed was slightly faster than an average Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. He traveled day and night, and in just a few days, the continent of the divine Ruins was in sight.</p><p>Back then, it would have taken several months to travel on lightning Rhino Supreme, but now that he was traveling at full speed, his speed was several dozen times faster than that of lightning Rhino Supreme.</p><p>Divine Ruins continent, I’m back again!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold, and he rushed towards the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>When he arrived at the divine Ruins continent, Lu Ming found a place to devour the rough stone and restore his cultivation to its peak.</p><p>“Sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, you will be the first one to be attacked!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, then tore open the space and left.</p><p>It was very simple to let the continent group of the divine Ruins know that Lu Ming had come to the continent of the divine Ruins in a short time. He just had to make a big commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming’s first target was the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion.</p><p>The sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion was located in a huge ancient city. It was located in the center of the ancient city and was a continuous stretch of palaces.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the sky above the ancient city. He did not hide his aura at all. A terrifying pressure enveloped the entire ancient city.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“A provocation! This is a provocation! So powerful! Is this a Paragon?”</p><p>“How could an Autarch have such a powerful aura?”</p><p>Instantly, the entire ancient city was in a clamor.</p><p>“Who’s there? How dare you provoke the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion! You’re courting death!”</p><p>“Audacious!”</p><p>In the center of the ancient city, a terrifying aura rushed out of the endless Palace.</p><p>All of them had the aura of an Emperor. Lu Ming scanned with his spiritual senses and discovered no less than twenty Emperor’s auras.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed in his heart. The divine Ruins continent was indeed powerful.</p><p>This was just the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence under the South God Palace, yet there were already more than twenty emperors. It was truly shocking, and it was far from what the divine wilderness continent could compare to.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, many figures rushed to the sky and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of nine figures, nine sovereigns.</p><p>Among them, two were at the second level Martial Emperor realm and seven were at the first level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Naturally, the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion wouldn’t send out all their powerhouses just because one person came to provoke them.</p><p>“Where’s hai pengtian? tell him to come out and face his death!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Hai pengtian was the name of the sea suppressing Marshal.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“He dares to provoke the Marshal, kill him!”</p><p>The sovereigns who surrounded Lu Ming roared. A few of them made their move and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw three punches in a row, followed by three shrieks. The three first level martial Royal realm experts were blown up in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The other sovereigns were shocked and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>They did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold. He dared to make a move in the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion. He was so ruthless that he killed Three Sovereigns at once.</p><p>These were emperors! Even in the South God Palace, they were high and mighty figures who ruled over a region. Now, three of them had died.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique and moved toward the remaining five sovereigns.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force was destructive. Whether it was a second level Martial Emperor or a first level Martial Emperor, he could destroy them with one punch.</p><p>After five punches, the remaining Five Emperors were all killed.</p><p>In the ancient city, the martial artists who witnessed this all took in a deep breath and were extremely shocked.</p><p>Where did this fiend come from? he was so young, but his battle prowess was unbelievably strong. He could kill emperors as if he was slaughtering dogs.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the entire ancient city began to shake, and several earth-shaking auras erupted from the center of the palace.</p><p>Then, a few figures appeared in front of Lu Ming. Their cold killing intent almost froze the world.</p><p>the great commander, the great commander has appeared!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The person in the lead had a head full of green hair. He looked similar to the green-haired middle-aged man who had charged into the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>This was hai pengtian, the sea suppressing Marshal, hai pengtian.</p><p>Hai pengtian’s aura was earth-shattering, as if he was the ruler of the entire world.</p><p>fourth level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank. He could feel a strong pressure from hai pengtian.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
