Di Xian felt like he had just walked past the god of death. He was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he would almost be killed by someone of the same generation on a remote island. He was furious and his killing intent was cold.</p><p>The silver-haired old man appeared behind di Xian, but he did not attack.</p><p>“Let’s see who kills who?”</p><p>Xie Luan and the other two blocked the five peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts, while Lu Ming charged at the two Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of swords resonated in the sky. Two third level martial Royal realm martial artists each took out a golden combat sword. They were both King spiritual weapons.</p><p>How powerful was an Emperor spiritual weapon that was controlled by a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert?</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He slashed down with the Dragon pattern sword, which was wrapped in the early stage of the chaos Domain.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two swords clashed, forming rings of sword ripples that spread out.</p><p>The LV 3 martial Royal realm expert was no match for Lu Ming. His body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Not far away, Di Yi, di Xian, and the silver-haired old man all narrowed their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength could actually suppress a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert?</p><p>Below, the experts of the Dragon Alliance were extremely excited.</p><p>Some people clenched their fists tightly.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful. He had not even broken through to the Martial Emperor realm, but he could already suppress a third level Martial Emperor.</p><p>This was a third level martial Royal realm! There was no one like him in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>30,000 years ago, Xie Luan had only reached the third level of the martial Royal realm at his peak.</p><p>Such an expert was suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Alliance master, this was the Alliance master of their Dragon Alliance.</p><p>If it was during the battle of the holy city, Lu Ming would not be a match for a third level martial Royal realm expert. Moreover, the other party had an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had broken through to the Supreme-level, his combat strength had increased tremendously. He was no longer the same as he was during the battle of the holy city.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, the other third level martial monarch powerhouse charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to see it. He held the Dragon vein sword and charged towards the person he had repelled.</p><p>Just as the sword of the person behind was approaching Lu Ming at high speed, a figure stepped out from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s clone.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The second body put his fingers together like a sword and slashed out. A sword light slashed out and blocked the other party’s combat sword.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming’s main body had been cultivating. Naturally, his secondary body had not been idle.</p><p>The second body focused on cultivation and had no other thoughts, so his improvement speed was even faster.</p><p>During the battle of the holy city, the second body had only condensed one Golden Spirit lamp, but during this time, the second body had already condensed a second Golden Spirit lamp, and his combat power had greatly increased.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Next, five Phoenix Feather flying swords flew out from between his brows and attacked the other party.</p><p>The other party was shocked and could only wave his sword to block.</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and continued to attack his opponent.</p><p>The embryonic form of the chaos Domain wrapped around the Dragon pattern sword. Lu Ming’s every sword attack was unimaginably powerful.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The other party was completely passive and could only wave his sword to block.</p><p>The two swords clashed for the second time. The other party’s body trembled continuously, and his face turned pale as he was forced to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming launched a storm-like attack, the Dragon vein sword slashing out continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>Suddenly-</p><p>Four sealing gates appeared in the sky. They shone with bright light and sealed the other party.</p><p>At that moment, the other party was frozen.</p><p>Even though it was only for a moment, it was enough.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast blood fusion and transformed into the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele pressed down on the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming had broken through to the Supreme-being realm and comprehended the embryonic form of the chaos realm. He had transformed into the prison-suppressing stele. How powerful was he?</p><p>Although the other party had broken open the sealing door at the critical moment and blocked it with his combat sword, his body still trembled. His body made crackling sounds and almost exploded. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Under the control of Lu Ming’s spiritual sense, the Dragon vein sword was as fast as lightning and slashed across.</p><p>The other party had just been severely injured by the prison-suppressing stele that Lu Ming had transformed into. How could he Dodge? The Dragon vein sword slashed down, and a head flew high into the air. The Dragon vein sword twisted again, and the opponent’s spiritual God was also turned into ashes.</p><p>A Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert had died!</p><p>On the other side, the battle of the second body was also coming to an end.</p><p>The second body lit up another Golden Spirit lamp, and his combat power was also greatly improved compared to the battle of the holy city. At this time, he took out the all formation picture and trapped the enemy.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Five Phoenix Feather flying swords shot out and pierced five holes in the opponent’s body, killing the opponent in one fell swoop.</p><p>The two Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts were killed just like that.</p><p>In the Imperial Dragon City, the experts of the Dragon Alliance were both shocked and overjoyed.</p><p>As for Di Yi, di Xian, and the others, they looked incredulous.</p><p>“Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body charged at di Xian at the same time.</p><p>“Not good! Young master, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The expression of the silver-haired old man beside di Xian changed. A golden combat sword appeared in his hand. He took a step forward and arrived in front of di Xian. The dazzling sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Without a doubt, the silver-haired elder’s sword was also an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>At the same time, the silver-haired elder’s cultivation was even more shocking. He had reached the peak of the LV 3 martial Royal realm.</p><p>However, the silver-haired elder was still no match for the joint attack of Lu Ming’s main body and second body. After exchanging a few moves, the silver-haired elder retreated continuously.</p><p>“Let’s go, retreat!”</p><p>Di Xian panicked. Lu Ming’s strength was beyond his imagination. He was much stronger than what Di Yi had said. He could not even defeat a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. He shouted and turned to run.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body joined forces and once again exchanged a blow with the silver-haired elder, forcing him to retreat dozens of miles.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The second body charged towards di Xian.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man’s expression changed drastically. He could not care less about the battle. He became one with his sword and turned into a sword light, appearing in front of di Xian in an instant.</p><p>In an instant, he slashed out 108 sword lights in all directions.</p><p>The mental energy fire between his eyebrows jumped. On the million formation illustration, countless formations shone. All kinds of formations, all kinds of attacks, all kinds of trapping formations poured toward the silver-haired old man and di Xian.</p><p>At the same time, five Phoenix Feather flying swords took the time to assassinate.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body had also arrived.</p><p>The silver-haired old man tried his best to protect di Xian, but the situation was dangerous.</p><p>“Young master, use the space-piercing shuttle!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man roared.</p><p>“Space-piercing shuttle, yes, yes, yes!”</p><p>Di Xian was so scared that he didn’t know what to do. His face was pale and his body was trembling. After the silver-haired old man’s reminder, he nodded repeatedly. The space between his brows lit up and a spirit weapon with two sharp ends and a thicker Center flew out.</p><p>As soon as this spiritual weapon appeared, it expanded rapidly and a layer of light enveloped di Xian and the silver-haired old man.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The silver-haired old man activated his Zhen Yuan, and the space-breaking shuttle shone. With a shake, it directly shattered the void and disappeared.</p><p>He couldn’t care about the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
