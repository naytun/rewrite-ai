In addition, he had also obtained some fortuitous encounters overseas. Over the years, his cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds, reaching the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. His rate of improvement was even faster than many of the heaven’s favorites who had awakened to the ninth level of the divine level.</p><p>Even ruan Tingting had barely reached the peak of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>This time, when they returned, they realized that the divine wilderness continent had been completely transformed.</p><p>Moreover, they had also heard the news about Lu Ming and the Alliance between the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family. They deduced that Lu Ming would definitely have a battle with the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie family. Therefore, they rushed over to help Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was very touched. He immediately arranged for the fatty, the devil-Sky King, and the rest to stay in their rooms.</p><p>The addition of the demonic sky sovereign meant that they had one more sovereign on their side, which was a great help.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming returned to the secret alchemy room.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days had passed. The Nirvana pill was finally about to be successfully refined.</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body ended its cultivation and opened his eyes.</p><p>A strong medicinal fragrance came out of the pill furnace.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>After a while, he lightly drank it and opened the pill furnace. An even stronger medicinal fragrance rushed out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The moment the pill furnace was opened, nine milky-white rays of light flew out from it.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>The second body waved his hand, and dense runes appeared in the sky, wrapping around the nine rays of light.</p><p>Within the light, there were nine milky white pills with strange patterns on them.</p><p>The pill danced within the inscriptions as if it had a mind of its own.</p><p>The second body took out a Jade bottle and put away all nine pills.</p><p>It was a success. The Nirvana elixir had been successfully refined. Lu Ming was overjoyed to have obtained a total of nine Nirvana elixir.</p><p>Although the Nirvana elixir was of no use to him, it was a priceless treasure to other martialists who had not awakened a ninth level divine bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The second body entered the main body’s glabella and disappeared. Lu Ming kept the Nirvana pills and left the secret chamber.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming invited Yan kuangtu and fatty Kong Jin to his residence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what good news do you have for me?” he asked.</p><p>The Fatty’s small eyes were spinning.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had not seen this guy for a few years. He had not changed at all.</p><p>“This time, there’s indeed something good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a Jade bottle appeared. Two Nirvana pills flew out from the bottle and flew to fatty and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>As soon as the two of them smelled the medicinal fragrance of the Nirvana pill, they knew that it was definitely not an ordinary pill. They quickly wrapped it with their true Qi and grabbed it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what kind of pill is this?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu asked curiously.</p><p>this pill is called the Nirvana pill. After consuming it, it will allow one’s bloodline to achieve Nirvana. There is a certain chance that it can raise one’s bloodline by one or even two levels!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yan kuangtu and fatty were completely stunned.</p><p>It could actually allow one’s bloodline to achieve Nirvana and increase in level.</p><p>‘This …’ This was too heaven-defying, right?</p><p>Their hearts were beating fast.</p><p>Both of their bloodlines were at the eighth level of the divine level. Although they seemed to be of a very high level, they were in fact not perfect.</p><p>Only a ninth-rank divine level expert would have a perfect bloodline.</p><p>In the great sects of the yuan continent, the minimum requirement for recruiting disciples was to awaken a ninth level divine bloodline.</p><p>The two of them naturally yearned for ninth level divine level bloodlines. However, bloodlines were inborn. Unless they were like Lu Ming, who had awakened the heaven-defying nine Dragon bloodline, it would be difficult for them to improve.</p><p>But now, the pill in their hands could improve their bloodline, and their breathing became heavier.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this pill is too precious …”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took a deep breath and was the first to calm down. He looked at Lu Ming and said, ”</p><p>“Big brother Yan, just accept it. The Nirvana pill will be the most useful for you.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu wasn’t a wishy-washy person, so he immediately put them away. Kong Jin, on the other hand, wasn’t polite at all.</p><p>Most importantly, the Nirvana elixir was too useful for them. Once their bloodline reached divine level nine, it would not be difficult for them to break through to the Emperor level.</p><p>There were only nine Nirvana pills. Lu Ming only planned to give them to Yan kuangtu and fatty for the time being. This was because their bloodlines were the closest to the ninth level of the divine level, so they were the most useful.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to give the rest to Lu Yuntian.</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to help Li Ping cultivate martial arts.</p><p>Only by cultivating martial arts could one’s lifespan be extended and Li Ping could live for a longer time.</p><p>Although Li Ping did not have the talent for cultivation and she was old, it was not a problem for Lu Ming with his current means.</p><p>With the help of the Nirvana elixir and the awakening of Li Ping’s bloodline, it would not be a problem for her to cultivate to the martial King realm or even the spirit ocean realm.</p><p>Also, his two in-name disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou.</p><p>Ever since he had taken them in as his disciples, Lu Ming had not taught them well. As their master, Lu Ming was not very responsible. Therefore, he had to leave two Nirvana pills for them.</p><p>In that case, there were only three Nirvana pills left. Lu Ming planned to keep them for now.</p><p>“Also, here’s a secret technique that’s suitable for you!”</p><p>Two Jade tokens flew out of Lu Ming’s hands and flew towards Yan kuangtu and the fatty.</p><p>After the two of them took a look, they were stunned again. Their eyes widened and their mouths opened so wide that they could swallow two duck eggs.</p><p>They were shocked. They were too shocked.</p><p>This was because the secret skill in the Jade token was the cultivation method for a pure spirit body.</p><p>Lu Ming made a few copies.</p><p>“There’s actually such a profound secret technique in the world!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu sighed, and at the same time, he was moved.</p><p>He had been stuck at the Supreme level for many years. Now that he had the Nirvana elixir and the pure spirit body, he was confident that he could break through to the Emperor realm in less than a year.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re My Lucky Star!”</p><p>The fat man did not stand on ceremony and quickly kept the pure spirit body cultivation method.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu cupped his fists at Lu Ming solemnly.</p><p>“Big brother Yan, with our relationship, there’s no need to thank me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After Yan kuangtu and fatty left, Lu Ming began to cultivate in seclusion with all his might.</p><p>It was getting closer and closer to the one-month deadline. Lu Ming wanted to improve his abilities as much as possible during this period of time.</p><p>Only a pure spirit body could increase his strength in a short time.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming put all his effort into cultivating the pure spirit body.</p><p>A huge amount of raw gemstones were refined by Lu Ming and turned into the strength of his physical body.</p><p>Finally, after half a month, the pure spirit body made another breakthrough and reached 60%.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability would increase with every 10% increase in his strength.</p><p>At this time, there was still a week left before the one-month deadline.</p><p>“I should go to the heaven suppressing divine Army!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step out of the secret cultivation room.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and Xie Luan broke through the void and left the hundred beasts tribe.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
