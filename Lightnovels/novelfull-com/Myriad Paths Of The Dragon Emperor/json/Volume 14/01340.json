Even his clothes didn’t move.</p><p>...</p><p>“You’re the one kneeling!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pressed her hand forward, and the sky demon force field burst out, enveloping Xie qiyu.</p><p>The sky demon power field’s powerful force field and terrifying destructive power instantly pressed down on Xie Qitian.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Xie qiyu’s expression changed drastically. It was as if hundreds of mountains were pressing down on his body. His body trembled and he almost knelt down.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Xie qiyu roared and used his domain to resist the sky demon force field.</p><p>The demonic Qi around Xie nianqing grew thicker. A bead appeared between her brows. At this moment, the power of her sky demon power field was raised to the extreme.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s Jade-like hand pressed down in the air again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie qiyu’s domain crumbled as he roared and knelt down in front of everyone’s shocked eyes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xie qiyu knelt down on the platform in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xie qiyu howled madly and struggled madly, his face turning the color of pig liver.</p><p>As a Supreme martial artist, it was already embarrassing for him to deal with a junior. However, in the end, not only did he fail to take down Xie nianqing, but he was forced to kneel in front of her before the official battle even began.</p><p>This was a great humiliation, and it was worse than killing him.</p><p>He was angry, he roared, he struggled, but it was useless against Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field.</p><p>Xie nianqing had obtained the inheritance of a Supreme figure in the demonic path. His Demonic Cultivation was extremely pure and powerful. Moreover, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached the great circle of the spirit God Realm. Killing an ordinary Supreme-being was a piece of cake for him.</p><p>In front of Xie nianqing, Xie qiyu didn’t have much power to resist.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Xie nianqing shouted, his eyes cold. He took a step forward and pointed his fingers at Xie qiyu like a sword.</p><p>Some Black Lotus petals appeared on her fingertips and condensed into a Lotus sword.</p><p>“Impudent, you dare?”</p><p>In the sky, a white-haired old man roared and stepped toward Xie nianqing. His Emperor’s aura pressed down on Xie nianqing.</p><p>This was an Emperor of the Xie clan!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, the white-haired Emperor sent out a palm print as large as a mountain towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s expression changed.</p><p>With her strength, she could easily kill an ordinary Supreme-being, but there was still a gap between her and an Emperor.</p><p>Just as Xie nianqing was about to leave Xie qiyu behind to block the attack, a voice rang in her ear.</p><p>Then, the Lotus sword in her hand did not stop and slashed towards Xie qiyu.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie qiyu shouted in fear.</p><p>“Evil creature!”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Xie Qitian and the white-haired Emperor roared from above. The white-haired Emperor’s palm print shone with a brilliant light, and its power was even more terrifying than Xie nianqing’s.</p><p>a dignified Emperor actually joined forces with others to deal with a junior. How shameless! I’ll be your opponent!</p><p>A clear voice was heard. A young figure suddenly appeared in front of the white-haired elder. It was Lu Ming’s clone.</p><p>Lu Ming put his fingers together like a sword. A ray of sword light appeared and he slashed.</p><p>The sword light easily split the white-haired elder’s palm print in half. The sword light did not stop and continued to slash at the white-haired Emperor.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Below him, a scream was heard, and then it stopped abruptly.</p><p>Fresh blood spurted out as Xie qiyu’s head flew far away.</p><p>His spiritual God flew out, but was also annihilated by the destructive power of the sky demon power field.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Before Xie qiyu’s body could fall, a scream came from above.</p><p>The white-haired Emperor retreated in a frenzy. His face was pale, and one of his arms had already disappeared.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock. If he had not retreated quickly, he would have been split in half by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, his long robe fluttering in the wind. His killing intent was like the tide. Sword Qi pulsed from his fingers as he slashed at the white-haired elder again.</p><p>This sword was so powerful that it shook the sky and earth. The entire sky was split open by this sword.</p><p>The terrifying sword power not only shocked the white-haired old man, but also the other emperors of the Xie family. It was too late for them to save him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a milky-white holy light condensed into a long spear. It pierced through the void and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying power made Lu Ming’s eyes narrow. The sword Qi in his hand also changed direction and slashed at the Holy Light spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a deafening collision sound, the sword Qi and the long spear both disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the sky.</p><p>A grey-haired old man walked out from the dozen or so Xie family sovereigns.</p><p>In his hand, holy light flickered and another long spear was formed.</p><p>peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>An Emperor from the heaven suppressing divine Army spoke in a grave voice.</p><p>The grey-haired old man was actually a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“Xie cangqiong, he’s Xie cangqiong!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed as they recognized this person.</p><p>“So it’s him!”</p><p>Everyone who had heard of this person’s name felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p>Xie cangqiong, the younger brother of the previous generation’s old divine Emperor, and the uncle of Xie Qitian. This person was shockingly talented, and his talent was even above the old divine Emperor’s. However, it was rumored that after he broke through to the Emperor level, he went overseas in search of the great Dao. Many people thought that he had long died overseas, but they didn’t expect that he was still alive, guarding the sacred city.</p><p>The Xie clan’s hidden strength was indeed astonishing.</p><p>it’s true that there are talents in every generation. Lu Ming, your talent is unprecedented. Let me be your opponent!</p><p>The spear of holy light in Xie cangqiong’s hand grew brighter and brighter, piercing the sky.</p><p>haha, Xie cangqiong, I should be your opponent!</p><p>At this moment, the old general of the heaven suppressing divine Army laughed. His aura burst out, and his eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He stepped into the void and locked his aura on Xie cangqiong.</p><p>Xie cangqiong’s expression changed. The old General’s cultivation was also at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm, which was not weaker than his. He did not dare to be careless.</p><p>traitors of the heaven suppressing divine Army will be executed today!</p><p>die! Xie Qitian shouted coldly as he released his aura.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Over a dozen sovereigns from the Xie family released their auras and pressed down on the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army didn’t show any weakness either. More than ten emperors released their auras and confronted the Xie family. The atmosphere was tense and a battle was about to break out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A golden sword light shot up into the sky. Even among the auras of so many emperors, it was still brilliant and dazzling.</p><p>It was Di Yi!</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming’s main body with killing intent. “Lu Ming, it’s time to deal with you!”</p><p>Di Yi’s powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xie Luan stepped forward, his demonic Qi like a rainbow. Di Yi, I am your opponent!</p><p>But a golden figure appeared in front of Xie Luan, blocking his path.</p><p>“Xie Luan, the previous battle was undecided. Let’s continue today!”</p><p>The man said coldly. He was di hongcheng.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
