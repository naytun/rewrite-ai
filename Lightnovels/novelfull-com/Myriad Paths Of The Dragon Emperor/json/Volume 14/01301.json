They’re all corpses of paragons!”</p><p>...</p><p>Supreme Thunder rhinoceros muttered to himself, his eyes filled with disbelief. He was even more shocked when he saw the corpse of the flood Dragon sovereign.</p><p>Naturally, he could sense that the flood Dragon sovereign’s bloodline contained 90% of the true dragon’s blood.</p><p>Even such a powerful Supreme-being was dead. Could it be that Lu Ming had killed him?</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros looked at Lu Ming. He could feel the terrifying killing intent radiating from Lu Ming’s body, as well as the suffocating pressure that he was exuding. His heart trembled.</p><p>“How long has it been? he’s already so powerful?”</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros felt his entire body tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p><p>When he had suppressed Thunder Rhino Supreme, he had carved a great formation on his body. During this time, Thunder Rhino Supreme had obediently stayed within the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>However, Lu Ming knew that Supreme lightning rhinoceros was definitely not convinced and was definitely looking for an opportunity to escape.</p><p>Lu Ming’s purpose in entering this time was to intimidate the Thunder Rhino Supreme.</p><p>As expected, Supreme Lu Ming was completely dumbfounded when he saw so many Supreme-being corpses.</p><p>“Thunder Rhino, follow me out and kill the enemy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out, and Supreme Thunder Rhino nodded his head repeatedly.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go out together!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming brought Xie nianqing and Supreme lightning rhinoceros out of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Lightning Rhino, go, over there!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, pointing in the direction of the ancient city’s exit.</p><p>Hai Yu had already escaped from the exit.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Thunder Rhino Supreme’s body expanded rapidly. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood on his body. With a loud roar, Thunder Rhino Supreme dashed towards the exit of the ancient city.</p><p>Oh my God, Lu Ming’s combat strength is too strong. He can stand shoulder to shoulder with an Emperor, or even suppress one!</p><p>it’s too terrifying. Lu Ming’s cultivation level is only at the perfected spiritual God Realm, but his combat strength is so shocking. I’ve never heard of it before!</p><p>“The key is how old Lu Ming is.”</p><p>“Abnormal, monstrous!”</p><p>Lu Ming must have gone after Hai Yu. Let’s go out and take a look!</p><p>The spectators were in an uproar. They couldn’t control their emotions at all. Even some Supreme-being experts were shouting as if they had lost control.</p><p>The fluctuation caused by Lu Ming was too shocking.</p><p>Then, the group of people rushed toward the exit of the ancient city.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming arrived at the ancient city’s exit on the Thunder rhinoceros. The Thunder rhinoceros rushed in, and in the next moment, they appeared in the deep sea.</p><p>A huge pressure was pressing down on them.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the surrounding seawater seemed to be under his control. It moved aside automatically and a passage appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros was shocked by Lu Ming’s methods. He then roared and rushed up.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s help, the lightning rhinoceros Supreme’s speed was extremely fast. Like a bolt of lightning, they rushed up. In just a short while, they had rushed out of the deep sea three hundred thousand meters deep and out of the surface.</p><p>As soon as he emerged from the sea, Lu Ming discovered that the air was filled with people.</p><p>When Lu Ming dashed out, everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on one of them.</p><p>Hai Yu!</p><p>Hai Yu did not run away after he emerged from the sea. He glared at Lu Ming coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s my brother, Haitian?”</p><p>Hai Yu shouted.</p><p>“He wanted to kill me, what do you think? Don’t worry, I’ll immediately send you down to accompany him!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>His words caused an uproar.</p><p>“What? When you saw Hai Yu running away in a hurry just now, you were so frightened. Was it because of him?”</p><p>“How could this be? Although Lu Ming’s combat strength is strong, he can’t possibly be Hai Yu’s match!”</p><p>that’s strange. Who on earth obtained the cultivation method of a pure spirit body? ”</p><p>The people who were waiting outside were shocked to see Hai Yu escape from the sea with a frightened expression. How could he do that with his cultivation?</p><p>They speculated that some powerful monster had appeared at the bottom of the sea that even Hai Yu was no match for. However, it seemed that Hai Yu fled in fear because of Lu Ming.</p><p>how dare you kill the people of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion! You should be executed by a thousand cuts!</p><p>At this time, a cold voice came from the side of Hai Yu.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and his pupils shrank slightly.</p><p>An old man in a purple-gold robe stood beside Hai Yu.</p><p>Earlier on, the aura of the old man had been concealed. He looked like an ordinary old man. That was why Lu Ming did not notice him.</p><p>However, as the elder spoke, a domineering aura burst out from his body. The pressure was as heavy as a mountain and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“The Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but say.</p><p>At the same time, he also understood why Hai Yu didn’t run away. It turned out that there was an Emperor of the Sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion here.</p><p>This was a true Emperor!</p><p>“Not good, it’s the Emperor, let’s go!”</p><p>Beneath Lu Ming’s feet, Supreme Thunder Rhino sensed the aura of the purple-and-golden-robed elder. He cried out in horror and turned around to escape.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm smacked Thunder Rhino Supreme’s head, almost causing it to explode. Thunder Rhino Supreme’s head buzzed and he was momentarily dazed.</p><p>“What are you running for? Wasn’t he just an Emperor? Do you have to be so scared?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Supreme lightning Rhino and said disdainfully.</p><p>“But he’s an Emperor!”</p><p>Supreme Thunder rhinoceros was still scared to death, but when he saw Lu Ming’s glare, he shivered in fear. He could only stop in his tracks and look at the purple-and-golden-robed elder with a guarded expression.</p><p>He was wailing in his heart, sighing that Lu Ming was courting death and should not have dragged him into it.</p><p>“Lu Ming is not running away!”</p><p>The same thought flashed through the minds of the others.</p><p>facing the Emperor, he probably knows that he can’t escape, so he might as well not escape!</p><p>Some people guessed.</p><p>hehe, I’ve already killed Hai Tian. I’m going to kill Hai Yu too. If you want to stop me, let’s see if you have the ability to do so!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe shouted coldly. However, he did not dare to underestimate Lu Ming.</p><p>Hai Yu had already told him about Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>He knew very well how powerful Hai Yu was with the Emperor spiritual weapon. Even if he was weaker than him, he was not that far behind. However, Lu Ming was able to suppress Hai Yu. One could only imagine how powerful he was.</p><p>“Nonsense, let’s see how you’re going to stop me. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. He shouted coldly and took a step forward, charging toward Hai Yu.</p><p>how arrogant! I’d like to see how much you’re worth. Earth domain!</p><p>The elder in the purple-gold robe extended his palm and pressed it in the air. A yellowish-brown circle spread out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Domain, this was a real domain, not the prototype of a Supreme realm.</p><p>The speed at which the comprehension shrouded him was shockingly fast. As soon as it appeared, it enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming felt a terrifying pressure on his body. It was as if hundreds of mountains were pressing down on him.</p><p>At the same time, a wave of destructive power charged toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
