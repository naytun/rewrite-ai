All of them had submitted to Martial Emperor Di Yi, and the entire Southern underworld was under his control.</p><p>...</p><p>The eastern barren territory’s heavenly corpse sect was also established by an Emperor of the southern underworld. The reason why they were constantly fighting against the Emperor heaven divine Palace was to attract attention and make the other transcendent powers not care too much about the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>In this way, Di Yi could continue to improve his strength in the dark. When the time was right, he could start a war.</p><p>A few months ago, Martial Emperor Di Yi finally couldn’t hold back and led the Army of the South underworld to attack the central continent. Many Overlord forces were destroyed by Martial Emperor Di Yi, and some directly surrendered.</p><p>Di Yi’s strength increased greatly, and he even sent out strong cultivators to help the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty deal with the heaven suppressing divine Army. After a shocking battle, the heaven suppressing divine Army suffered heavy losses and retreated to the border of Northern Plains to join forces with Xie Luan to fight against the strong enemy.</p><p>Thus, during this period of time, the atmosphere was extremely tense, all the experts of Northern Plains were gathered in the hundred beasts tribe, ready to deal with the enemy’s attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked after hearing the story.</p><p>At the same time, he also understood something.</p><p>He now understood why the heavenly corpse sect of the eastern barren territory could rise up in such a short time and compete with the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. It was all under the arrangement of Martial Emperor Di Yi. Of course, their strength had increased quickly.</p><p>Back then, when they were fighting for the Heavenly King’s token, the eastern barren territory and the southern netherworld did not make any moves. Lu Ming and the rest found it strange at that time, but it made sense now.</p><p>The East barren and the South underworld were basically under the control of Martial Emperor Di Yi. At that time, the time was not right. Without Martial Emperor Di Yi’s order, the East barren and the South underworld naturally would not take action.</p><p>even if Di Yi and the Masters of the South underworld are added, their strength should not be so strong. If the overlords of the central continent join forces, there will be many emperors. How can they be defeated by Di Yi? although Di Yi’s combat strength is strong, the heaven suppressing divine Army has a deep foundation. There may be some strong people who can compete with him. How can he be defeated so easily? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the question in his heart.</p><p>Although Di Yi’s combat power was strong, even with the addition of Nanming, there would not be too many emperors. There would not be more than seven. Some of the stronger Overlord forces in the central continent would have two emperors, or even more. If several Overlord forces joined forces, they would not be so easily destroyed.</p><p>because Di Yi has helpers. Di Yi’s cultivation is at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm and he has a King spiritual weapon. The key is that two terrifying experts have suddenly appeared beside him. Both of them are at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm and they also have King spiritual weapons!</p><p>Xie Luan said with a grave expression.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>There were two more experts at the peak of Lv 2 martial Royal realm beside Di Yi.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, a peak second level martial Royal realm expert was definitely at the peak. Before Lu Ming went to the divine wilderness continent, the only peak second level martial Royal realm experts on the surface were Xie Luan and Di Yi, which showed how rare they were.</p><p>But now, how could there suddenly be two experts at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm beside Di Yi?</p><p>What was even more shocking was that the two of them had Emperor spiritual weapons?</p><p>Emperor spiritual weapons were extremely rare, and most emperors would find it hard to own one.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also understood the current situation of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Although there were not many emperors around Di Yi, their high-end combat power was too strong.</p><p>Di Yi himself, along with two peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts, could definitely sweep away the Overlord forces of the divine wilderness continent. No one could defeat him.</p><p>No wonder the atmosphere in Northern Plains was so heavy and tense.</p><p>In Northern Plains, Xie Luan was the only one who was at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>now, Di Yi’s Army is attacking the few Overlord forces in the central continent. I heard that they have besieged the Tianxia Academy in recent days. The Tianxia Academy is in danger!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Tianxia Academy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly brightened, exuding a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are your thoughts?”</p><p>Xie Luan asked.</p><p>rescue them! Rescue the Tianxia Academy! Lu Ming said firmly.</p><p>“Haha, rescue? Lu Ming, with what? Now that Di Yi is powerful and has many masters, we can’t even protect ourselves. How can we save him?”</p><p>Qu Luo sneered, his tone full of disdain.</p><p>The rest of the people also shook their heads, apparently agreeing with qu Luo.</p><p>Below, Yan kuangtu wanted to say something but stopped himself. He seemed to have something to say to Lu Ming, but he held back in the end.</p><p>if the lips die, the teeth will grow cold. I’m sure you all understand that the Tianxia Academy is not weak. If it is broken by Di Yi and surrenders to him, it will only strengthen Di Yi’s strength. If we save it and join forces with us, it will strengthen our strength. Only then can we possibly compete with Di Yi!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s true, but logic is logic. In fact, we are not strong enough. We have to defend with all our strength to have a chance of survival. If we go to the rescue and cause Di Yi to attack in advance, Lu Ming, will you be responsible for this? ”</p><p>Qu Luo sneered.</p><p>“If I’m the one to lose, then I’ll lose!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, you’re going to lose? Ridiculous. Lu Ming, to put it bluntly, what right do you have to take responsibility for this? Although you’re in an alliance with the demon ancestor, in this world, strength is everything. If you don’t have the strength, then be more honest!”</p><p>Qu Luo laughed out loud. This sentence was clearly belittling Lu Ming.</p><p>Xie Luan frowned, thinking that qu Luo had gone too far. But he also didn’t agree with saving the Tianxia Academy now, so he pondered for a moment and didn’t speak.</p><p>Lu Ming, I can tell you clearly that if you want to save the Tianxia Academy, you have to do it yourself. We will not help you, in case Di Yi attacks you in advance!</p><p>Qu Luo said.</p><p>“I’ll go with Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu stepped forward.</p><p>“I’ll go with Lu Ming too!”</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>Then, two voices were heard. It was the Barbarian Emperor of the hundred beasts tribe and Martial Emperor Yuexin of the floating mountain.</p><p>no, you’re not allowed to go either. You’re in the same boat as us now. If you go, you’ll weaken our strength and attract Di Yi’s attack in advance!</p><p>Quluo said loudly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Yan kuangtu, the Barbarian Emperor, and the others had unsightly expressions.</p><p>you don’t need to go. I can save Tianxia Academy by myself!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice suddenly rang out, causing everyone to be stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming alone? Rescue the Tianxia Academy?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>hahaha, Lu Ming, it seems that your vision has changed after your trip to the continent of the divine Ruins. You’ve become more and more self-aware. No wonder you even dare to offend the pride of a major sect in the yuan continent!</p><p>Quluo sneered.</p><p>At the thought of obediently listening to Lu Ming’s orders in the past, qu Luo felt uncomfortable.</p><p>At that time, he had thought that Lu Ming could join a major sect in the yuan continent. He had taken Xie Luan’s words and followed Lu Ming’s orders because he saw his future.</p><p>He was an Emperor, but he was actually taking orders from a young man in his twenties. He had always felt uncomfortable in his heart.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had overestimated himself and dared to offend a heaven’s favorite of a major sect in the yuanlu continent, he was almost killed. The road ahead was cut off. Naturally, he would no longer hide his thoughts and would no longer listen to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
