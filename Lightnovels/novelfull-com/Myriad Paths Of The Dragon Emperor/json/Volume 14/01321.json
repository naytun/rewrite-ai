The condition of the Alliance was that Lu Ming would be able to guide him when he joined a major sect in the yuanlu continent.</p><p>He had been suppressed for 30000 years, and all his family and friends had turned into dust.</p><p>He no longer had any worries about the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>In his eyes, there was only cultivation, cultivation, and the pursuit of higher martial arts. He had no interest in power.</p><p>Therefore, after seeing Lu Ming’s current combat level, he planned to slowly hand over the power to Lu Ming. He would just assist Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had obviously thought of this as well. He glanced at Xie Luan but did not say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming now had friends, family, and loved ones. If he wanted to protect these people, he needed power and authority.</p><p>Since Xie Luan had intentionally given in, he would not be polite either.</p><p>The group entered the White jade Palace, it shone and broke open the space, directly entering the alternate dimension and heading towards Northern Plains.</p><p>Not long after …</p><p>Northern Plains, in the sky above the hundred beasts tribe, the space split open and the White jade Palace appeared.</p><p>After a while, the conference hall of the hundred beasts tribe was filled with people.</p><p>All the higher-ups of Northern Plains, as well as the experts of Tianxia Academy, were almost all present.</p><p>Xie Luan and Lu Ming were still sitting at the very top.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with respect and awe.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s battle at Tianxia Academy had spread.</p><p>It was easy for him to defeat a peak second level Martial Emperor and kill a first level Martial Emperor.</p><p>This level of combat strength was already at the peak of the divine wilderness continent, looking down on everyone.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was still so young and his cultivation level was only at the spiritual God stage. No one could predict Lu Ming’s future and potential.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with respect and awe.</p><p>everyone, we have received news that Di Yi of the Emperor heaven divine Palace is going to form an alliance with the Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>After everyone was seated, an Emperor from the Tianxia Academy announced a shocking piece of news.</p><p>Everyone gasped when they heard the news.</p><p>“What? The Empyrean heaven divine Palace wants to form an alliance with the Xie clan?”</p><p>“Is this true?”</p><p>“We’re in trouble!”</p><p>The discussion hall was instantly in an uproar.</p><p>it’s absolutely true. In a month’s time, the two sides will hold an Alliance ceremony in the holy city!</p><p>The burly Emperor of the Tianxia Academy said.</p><p>The scene fell silent again.</p><p>Everyone frowned, their expressions grave.</p><p>Now, the strongest force in the divine wilderness continent was, without a doubt, the Ditian divine Palace, led by Di Yi.</p><p>The Empyrean heaven divine Palace gathered the power of the eastern barren territory and the southern netherworld. In addition, some of the hegemonic powers of the central continent had also surrendered, and their power was growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>Most importantly, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace had three peak experts. They were like three huge mountains that weighed down on everyone’s hearts.</p><p>Other than the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, the other strongest forces were the Xie family of the ancient sacred dynasty and his allies. There was also the heaven suppressing divine Army and its allies.</p><p>And then there was their Northern Plains.</p><p>Western Desert had always stayed out of it, not participating in the battle meant that it was excluded.</p><p>Out of the four great powers, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was the strongest. However, the Royal Xie clan had a history of over a million years. In terms of their foundations, they were definitely the strongest. No one could see through them and they definitely couldn’t be underestimated.</p><p>Now, these two giants were about to join forces. Could the other forces still compete with them?</p><p>Originally, although the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was strong, their Foundation was not strong enough, and the number of emperors they had was relatively small.</p><p>Including Di Yi, there were still two experts at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm, the southern underworld’s Emperor, and some surrendered emperors. There were only a dozen of them.</p><p>In this regard, the number of emperors from the Xie family and their allies, as well as the heaven suppressing divine Army and their allies, all surpassed that of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Even in Northern Plains, the number of emperors added up to more than ten.</p><p>Although the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was powerful at its peak, they didn’t have many emperors. The other powers could still contend against them.</p><p>But now, the Alliance between the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and the Xie clan could make up for this weakness. At that time, they would definitely be able to sweep across the world. Be it the heaven suppressing divine Army or Northern Plains, they would find it hard to contend against them.</p><p>Thinking of this, everyone’s hearts were extremely heavy.</p><p>Why would the Xie clan and the Empyrean heaven divine Palace form an alliance?</p><p>No one could figure it out. With the current momentum of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, what would happen to the Xie family if they unified the divine wilderness?</p><p>There must be an unknown transaction in this.</p><p>“What should we do now?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>The scene was silent, and no one spoke.</p><p>Even Xie Luan and Lu Ming were frowning.</p><p>“Let’s talk about our own opinions and discuss it!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke after a while.</p><p>“That’s right, tell me!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Everyone chimed in, expressing their own opinions.</p><p>Some people suggested taking the initiative to attack one side and fight with them to break the Alliance.</p><p>However, there were people who immediately rebutted. The strength of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was extremely strong, and those three peak experts were unrivaled. It wasn’t a wise decision to attack the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>As for the Xie family, they were in charge of the holy city and had a deep foundation. The holy city had never been breached before, so it was very dangerous to attack the Xie family.</p><p>These people advocated defense and held fast to Northern Plains.</p><p>Everyone spoke one after another, they argued until they finally reached a consensus to defend Northern Plains and raise their strength.</p><p>Their hopes were on Xie Luan and Lu Ming.</p><p>Xie Luan was originally a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. He had only been injured to the core and needed time to recover.</p><p>If they held their ground and did not come out, the situation would change when Xie Luan recovered to the third level of the martial Royal realm. They would have the upper hand in terms of peak combat strength.</p><p>The other person was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was still young and his cultivation level was only at the perfected spiritual God Realm. If Lu Ming’s cultivation level were to improve further, he would become even stronger and be able to change the outcome of the battle.</p><p>Therefore, the final result of the discussion was to hold on, wait, and improve their strength.</p><p>Lu Ming did not object to this.</p><p>What he lacked now was time.</p><p>As long as he had time, the pure spirit body would improve every day, and his strength would become stronger and stronger.</p><p>Furthermore, if he broke through to the Supreme-level, his chaos intent would transform into the early stage of the chaos Domain. His combat strength would increase dramatically, and he would not be afraid even if he faced a peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert with an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming and Xie Luan finalized this plan.</p><p>“That’s right, big brother Yan!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Yan kuangtu. “Senior Bai Shijin, where are senior du songjue and the others? Why haven’t I seen him?”</p><p>Logically speaking, with Lu Ming’s return and such a major event happening in the divine wilderness continent, Bai Shijin, du songjue and the rest would definitely take the inter-territory teleportation array to come and discuss matters. However, ever since Lu Ming returned, they had not been seen.</p><p>After Lu Ming spoke, Yan kuangtu’s expression changed. His gaze was complicated, and he hesitated to speak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>Sure enough, when Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Xie Luan, the Barbarian Emperor, qu Luo, and the others, he saw that they had complicated looks in their eyes and did not dare to look him in the eye.</p><p>Lu Ming’s bad premonition grew stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
