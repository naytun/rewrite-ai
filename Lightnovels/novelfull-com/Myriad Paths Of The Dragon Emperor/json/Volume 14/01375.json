They were overbearing and powerful. When had they ever been in such a miserable state? there were more than twenty sovereigns, and all of them were killed. Even a Colossus like the South God Palace would feel pain in their hearts.</p><p>Hai pengtian’s eyes had turned red. These were all his subordinates, and they were all killed just like that. He knew that he was finished. His position as the sea suppressing Marshal had come to an end.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to cut you into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>Hai pengtian roared in anger. The pair of wings on his back emitted a sharp light. The light shone brightly and swept across, shattering the formations that he had set up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He charged toward Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Haha, hai pengtian, I’m not going to play with you anymore. Let’s stop here today!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took a step forward and entered the main body’s glabella. Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and sped into the distance.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Hai pengtian glared at Lu Ming and pushed his cultivation to the limit. He flapped his wings madly, destroying the formation in the sky. Then, with a flap of his wings, he turned into a rainbow and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, hai pengtian, I forgot to tell you something. I’ve already killed your second brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. The energy of the air-frozen bead gushed into his body. Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. In a few moments, he had left hai pengtian behind.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Hai pengtian felt a suffocating feeling in his chest and almost spat out a mouthful of blood. In the end, he gritted his teeth and controlled his wings with all his might to pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>However, with the help of the air-frozen bead, Lu Ming’s speed was slightly faster than hai pengtian’s. The more they flew, the further the distance between the two of them grew.</p><p>In less than an hour, hai pengtian could no longer see Lu Ming’s shadow.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I will definitely catch you!”</p><p>Hai pengtian let out an angry roar and stopped unwillingly.</p><p>A few days later, the news that Lu Ming had come to the continent of Divine Ruins and killed more than 20 emperors of the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion spread to the entire continent of Divine Ruins at the speed of a whirlwind, and even to other continents.</p><p>For a time, thousands of waves were stirred up!</p><p>Now, countless experts were looking for Lu Ming, but he was so bold that he came to the continent of the divine Ruins of his own accord.</p><p>Moreover, he was very high-profile. As soon as he arrived in the divine Ruins continent, he killed his way to the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion, killed more than 20 emperors, and then retreated calmly.</p><p>This shocked many people!</p><p>Many people began to reevaluate Lu Ming’s combat strength. Some of the weaker martial emperors decided to back out, but those who were stronger and had reached the Martial Emperor realm did not give up.</p><p>All of a sudden, terrifying experts gathered in the southern region of the South God Palace in an attempt to capture Lu Ming.</p><p>Most of these experts were from the eastern, northern and western divine palaces!</p><p>As long as Lu Ming appeared in a certain place, a large number of experts would rush over.</p><p>Among them, hai pengtian was the most active.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p>In the past month, Lu Ming would occasionally show himself and then escape in the dark. His goal was obvious. He wanted to tell the outside world that he, Lu Ming, was in the divine Ruins continent. That way, those experts would not go to the divine wilderness continent to find him.</p><p>……</p><p>In the South God Palace, ten people were sitting in a meeting hall.</p><p>These ten people were the patriarchs of the ten great clans of the South God Palace. They were also the ten people with the highest status in the South God Palace.</p><p>The ten of them gathered to discuss Lu Ming’s matter!</p><p>“Everyone, what should the South God Palace do about Lu Ming’s matter?”</p><p>One of them asked.</p><p>of course we’ll send experts to capture Lu Ming. He still has a primordial chaos token on him!</p><p>One of the middle-aged men, who was rather handsome, said.</p><p>This person was wearing a milky white long robe and had a rather refined aura. This person was one of the ten great clans, the Wang clan’s clan head, Wang Zhen’s father, Wang Sheng!</p><p>that’s right. I agree with brother Wang’s suggestion. We should send out experts to take Lu Ming down. As long as we don’t kill him, we can even cripple his cultivation!</p><p>At Wang Sheng’s side, a person coldly said.</p><p>This person was the newly promoted master of the MU family.</p><p>The previous head of the MU family had joined forces with young master Lin of the deity sect to chase after Lu Ming. They had chased him into the core of the divine Ruins and were killed by the headless true dragon Rider. Therefore, this person was newly promoted.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s appropriate!”</p><p>At this moment, another voice was heard.</p><p>Wang Sheng’s eyes turned cold, looking at that person, he said: “Ji Feng, what do you mean by this? Why is it inappropriate? I know that your daughter, Ji hongchen, has some friendship with Lu Ming. Are you trying to help him?”</p><p>Ji Feng, the clan head of the Ji clan, was Ji hongchen’s father.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Ji Feng gave Wang Sheng a contemptuous look and said: “Now that Long Chen is in the hands of our South deity Palace, the other three great divine palaces are already envious. What will the other three great divine palaces do if we capture Lu Ming? Will they join forces to attack our South God Palace? at that time, what will our South God Palace have to resist?”</p><p>His words silenced the hall.</p><p>“That’s right, I think brother Ji has a point. The South deity Palace will not interfere in Lu Ming’s matter for the time being!” Someone else said after a long while.</p><p>Lu Ming killed more than 20 emperors from the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion. Are we going to just let it go? ”</p><p>The MU family’s master was unwilling.</p><p>“We don’t need to do anything to Lu Ming. If he falls into the hands of the other three celestial palaces, he’ll definitely suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>that’s right, we just need to do our best to protect Long Chen. Moreover, to enter the divine Ruins, a mixed-essence token is enough!</p><p>“Indeed, Lu Ming, let them fight for it!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>Wang Sheng and the MU family’s head were helpless, and could only compromise.</p><p>……</p><p>In the southern part of the divine Ruins continent, in a wild mountain.</p><p>This place was extremely well-hidden and filled with demonic Qi. Unless one was an expert who cultivated the demonic path, very few people would come here.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing appeared there.</p><p>“Little Qing, you should cultivate here for the time being!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? Don’t even think about leaving me alone!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smacked his lips.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Xiaoqing, don’t worry. I’ll be fine. I’ll come and visit you after a while!</p><p>Seeing that Xie nianqing was still staring at him with wide eyes, Lu Ming said, ” “And I have a main body and a secondary body. My main body and my secondary body will act separately. Nothing will happen to me!”</p><p>“You want to go to the South God Palace and ask about Long Chen’s whereabouts?”</p><p>Xie nianqing was extremely intelligent. He guessed Lu Ming’s thoughts right away.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. that’s right. I’m planning to let my second body sneak into the South God Palace. My main body will be outside to attract the attention of others!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan!</p><p>He would use his main body outside to attract the attention of those experts, while his second body would sneak into the South God Palace and wait for an opportunity to rescue Long Chen.</p><p>This operation would be dangerous. Although he had the mountain and river diagram and could bring Xie nianqing along, Lu Ming could not guarantee that he would not be in danger.</p><p>If anything happened to him, Xie nianqing, who was in the mountain and river diagram, would definitely not be spared. That was why he left Xie nianqing here and acted alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
