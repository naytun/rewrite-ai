A magnitude 10 earthquake occurred in the divine wilderness. Countless cultivators and factions were stirred up.</p><p>A few days later, the news of the Dragon Alliance’s establishment and Lu Ming’s appointment as the alliance leader spread throughout the divine wilderness continent again through the voice transmission jade talisman.</p><p>Countless forces, big and small, surrendered and expressed their willingness to join the Dragon Alliance.</p><p>Right now, the Xie clan had sealed themselves off as the Imperial Palace for ten thousand years. The Emperor heaven divine Palace had been destroyed, and the Dragon Alliance was truly unrivaled in the world. No power dared to resist.</p><p>After that, the Dragon Alliance’s army split into three.</p><p>The old general led a large Army and swept through the central continent.</p><p>Xie Luan led a large Army to attack the southern underworld.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he would lead the Army to the eastern barren territory.</p><p>There was almost no doubt about this, all the forces in central continent surrendered.</p><p>When Xie Luan attacked the southern underworld, he only received a little resistance. Those who resisted were easily killed by Xie Luan, and the rest surrendered.</p><p>Half a month after the battle at the holy city, Lu Ming led his men and set foot on the yin and yang mountain again.</p><p>“Mount Liangyi has finally been taken back!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others stood high in the sky, looking at the vast land of Mount Liangyi in the distance. They were filled with emotions.</p><p>When they were captured by Di Yi, they thought that they would never be able to take back mount Liangyi. They did not expect that they would return to Mount Liangyi so quickly in just a few months.</p><p>“Zongzi, no, Alliance master …”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the rest looked at Lu Ming with complicated expressions. They did not know how to address him.</p><p>senior, since I’m master Lian Cang’s disciple, I’m also the zongzi of the talisman sect. You can call me zongzi in private!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, zongzi!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming was now the leader of the Dragon Alliance and ruled the world. They were afraid that Lu Ming would look down on the talisman Amulet sect and did not know what to do with it. However, it seemed that Lu Ming had not forgotten his roots.</p><p>There were many experts in the Dragon League.</p><p>As for the talisman Amulet sect, they still didn’t have an Emperor. They were afraid that the talisman Amulet sect wouldn’t be able to compete with the other experts in the Dragon Alliance. The other forces wouldn’t be allocated enough resources and would eventually decline.</p><p>However, they did not have to worry now. Lu Ming, the alliance leader, was the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect. The talisman Amulet sect had an extraordinary status in the Dragon Alliance. They did not have to worry about not being able to obtain resources without an Emperor.</p><p>“Senior white, senior du, from now on, you two will lead the disciples of the talisman Amulet sect to guard the yin and yang mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Yes, zongzi!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and du songjue accepted the order.</p><p>“Let’s go to ninedragons!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Army set off for ninedragons.</p><p>As for the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, it would fly back to ninedragons after the battle of the holy city and suppress the nine dragon veins again.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, they did not encounter any resistance when they arrived at ninedragons.</p><p>The forces in ninedragons had already opened their gates. When Lu Ming’s Army arrived, they all knelt down and surrendered to Lu Ming.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the Alliance master of the Dragon Alliance. We are willing to return to the Dragon Alliance and serve the Alliance master!”</p><p>There were five to six Supreme martial artists standing at the very front, bowing and saluting in fear.</p><p>“Hehe, we’re all old acquaintances!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and looked down at the six Supreme martial artists.</p><p>Out of the six Supreme-beings, three of them were Lu Ming’s ‘old acquaintances’. They were the three remaining family heads of the six great ancient families-the Dongfang family, the Kong family, and the Nangong family.</p><p>The three clan heads broke out in cold sweat when Lu Ming’s gaze swept over them.</p><p>Alliance master, we were blind in the past and offended you. From now on, we’ll be at your beck and call and do our best!</p><p>The head of the Dongfang family said, his face covered in cold sweat.</p><p>The pressure that Lu Ming was exuding made it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>They knew that as long as Lu Ming gave the order, not only them, but even their families would be exterminated.</p><p>In the crowd behind him, many of the paragons who had dealt with Lu Ming before and even competed with him knelt on the ground. They had mixed feelings.</p><p>For example, Dong Fang Yu and the others.</p><p>A few years ago, Lu Ming was still competing with them.</p><p>However, a few years later, Lu Ming was already standing at the peak of the divine wilderness continent, ruling the world. There was really no way to compare.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>The master of the Dongfang family and the rest trembled in fear. They did not understand what Lu Ming was thinking. Would he kill them? This kind of waiting was extremely torturous.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming said indifferently, ” alright, I will allow you to surrender. However, all of you will have to move out of ninedragons to the Northern Plains. Do you have any objections? ”</p><p>no, I have no objections. Thank you Alliance master for showing mercy. This subordinate is extremely grateful!</p><p>The head of the Dongfang family and the others let out a long breath and thanked him repeatedly.</p><p>For them, although ninedragons was their Foundation and they had been developing here for nearly 10000 years, it was a pity to move away. However, it was much better than the disaster of being killed and their families exterminated. Naturally, they did not dare to say anything.</p><p>Not long after, the powerful forces in ninedragons started to use the inter-territory teleportation formation to head to Northern Plains.</p><p>In Northern Plains, there would naturally be someone to arrange for them.</p><p>As for the small forces in ninedragons, they were not necessary. They could not cause any trouble even if they stayed.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming left Xia Jiuyang behind. Yan kuangtu and the others took care of ninedragons, the original heavenly corpse sect, and the myriad demon Valley. Lu Ming went to the East alone.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming entered the Tianxuan region. However, he did not go to the Tianxuan sub-Palace immediately. The first place he went to was the hundred deities slope.</p><p>News of the battle of the holy city had already spread throughout the entire divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Including the Tianxuan region.</p><p>Out of all the sub-palaces of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, some of them were in chaos. Without any control, there were all sorts of incidents where people fought for the treasures of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Some of the sub-palaces were restrained and were waiting for news.</p><p>They knew that once the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was destroyed, there would definitely be a powerful force that would take over the territory of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. There would definitely be someone who would take over their territory.</p><p>Tianxuan sub-Palace was not in chaos.</p><p>In the middle of Tianxuan city, in a courtyard, a few people were drinking tea and discussing something.</p><p>The leader was mu Tian, the palace Master of Tianxuan sub-Palace.</p><p>On the side, mu Yi and mu Zheng were there.</p><p>I didn’t expect that the vast empyrean heaven divine Palace, which has been passed down for 10000 years, would collapse so easily!</p><p>Mu Yi drank a cup of wine and sighed.</p><p>A few days ago, they had received the news and were extremely shocked. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>The Emperor heaven divine Palace was such a huge existence, yet it had fallen?</p><p>the path of martial arts is fraught with danger. Even a cultivation Emperor can still fall if he’s not careful!</p><p>Mu Zheng also sighed.</p><p>“It’s said that more than 20 emperors died in this battle!”</p><p>Mu Tian said, his voice slightly interfering.</p><p>The three brothers had an expression of disbelief on their faces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
