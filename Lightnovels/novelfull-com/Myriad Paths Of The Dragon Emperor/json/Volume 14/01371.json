My brother’s two sons died in his hands. Lu Ming is the sea Conqueror’s mansion’s enemy!”</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man’s gaze swept across the entire place.</p><p>He was more concerned about the powerhouses from the other continents. As for Lu Ming, he did not take him to heart at all.</p><p>“I have no objections if you want Lu Ming. Just leave the primordial chaos token behind!”</p><p>that’s right. Take him away, but leave the primordial chaos token!</p><p>The other emperors spoke.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Azure-haired man snorted.</p><p>He had to kill Lu Ming, but his main goal was still the primordial chaos token.</p><p>“Are you done with your nonsense?”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, a cold, knife-like killing intent slowly rising from his body.”Do you know why this place is called the fallen Emperor mountain?”</p><p>Everyone cast their gaze on Lu Ming again.</p><p>that’s because an Emperor has fallen here. That’s why I chose this place to be your burial ground!</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice spread in all directions.</p><p>“What? You’re so arrogant!”</p><p>“You still want to kill us? what a joke!”</p><p>“Don’t make a move, let me kill him first!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, the other sovereigns were furious.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly roared and launched an attack.</p><p>He soared into the sky and charged at several second level martial emperors.</p><p>Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard as nine streams of dragon energy burst forth. At the same time, the third bloodline emerged. A surge of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, and then the chaos Domain spread all over his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword slashed out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had almost used all his strength.</p><p>No one had expected that Lu Ming would dare to attack when he was surrounded by more than twenty sovereigns.</p><p>Moreover, these 20 sovereigns were all above the second level of the martial Royal realm. What a terrifying force this was?</p><p>Therefore, when Lu Ming made his move, they were stunned.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The Dragon vein sword swept across and the three second level martial Royal realm experts were cut in half at the waist. The sword Qi burst forth and crushed their spiritual gods into pieces.</p><p>Three people were killed in an instant.</p><p>As Lu Ming drew his sword, the space between his eyebrows glowed. He stepped forward and waved his hand. Five Phoenix-feathered flying swords shot out rapidly, and the cries of phoenixes shook the sky.</p><p>Five shrill screams were heard as the Phoenix-feathered flying sword pierced through the dantian of five Lv 2 martial Royal realm experts, crushing their spiritual gods.</p><p>Lu Ming launched an attack. The main body and the second body attacked at the same time, killing eight experts in an instant.</p><p>At this time, the others finally reacted.</p><p>“Damn it, you dare to launch a surprise attack!”</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>“Attack and crush him!”</p><p>Angry roars were heard and some people felt chills all over their bodies. If Lu Ming had attacked them just now, what would have happened?</p><p>Instantly, attacks were launched at the main body and the second body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and moved slightly. Like a fleeting shadow, he disappeared from his original spot.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Then, a second level Martial Emperor was split in half by Lu Ming.</p><p>the wind-frozen bead, combined with the wind elemental technique, is indeed extremely fast!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the air-frozen bead and a green energy appeared around his body. Then, he cast the wind element spell. Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that even an Emperor would find it difficult to catch up with him.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and the void was filled with formations. He used the formations to Dodge the attacks. At the same time, he controlled the five Phoenix-feathered flying swords and killed another Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the million formation illustration appeared. Countless great formations emerged and attacked the emperors.</p><p>The ten thousand formation illustration was most suitable for group battles.</p><p>The countless formations, be it offensive, defensive, or trapping, threw the sovereigns into confusion.</p><p>With his current strength, even a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert would be afraid of him if he used the all formation picture.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s main body cast the wind elemental technique and his figure flashed rapidly.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as experts were killed one after another.</p><p>“Second master, save me!”</p><p>A Lv 2 martial Royal realm expert from the sea suppressing Marshal’s mansion shouted.</p><p>However, the green-haired middle-aged man was being attacked by the second body. Countless great formations poured down on him. Of the five Phoenix Feather flying swords, three of them were constantly stabbing toward him. He could only barely protect himself, so how could he have the energy to save others?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The experts of the sea suppressing Marshal’s residence were easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength and the cooperation between his main body and his secondary body, killing a second level Martial Emperor was as easy as cutting vegetables.</p><p>Furthermore, most of these people didn’t have an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there were only five martial emperors left out of the twenty.</p><p>Five Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts.</p><p>The other second level martial Royal realm experts were all killed.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>this person is a demon. He’s a Shura, a demon!</p><p>A few Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts shouted. They were simply scared out of their wits.</p><p>Lu Ming was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>There were more than 20 of them. If they were to join forces, even a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert would have to retreat. However, they were almost completely massacred by Lu Ming.</p><p>This did not mean that Lu Ming’s strength was stronger than a fourth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>It was because the coordination between Lu Ming’s main body and his secondary body was too seamless, especially for group battles. It was simply not suitable.</p><p>The second body could activate the ten thousand formation picture, trapping, disturbing, and attacking enemies, all of which were large-scale attacks. No matter how many enemies there were, they could still be trapped. Moreover, the second body itself had a strong attack power.</p><p>Coupled with the main body’s cooperation in the attack, the opponent’s advantage in numbers was not even fully displayed before they were beaten up by Lu Ming with a thunderous momentum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming performed the blood fusion and turned into the prison-suppressing stele, suppressing a third level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The LV 3 martial Royal realm expert spat out a mouthful of blood and half of his body exploded.</p><p>After that, the Dragon vein sword slashed out and that person was killed.</p><p>Then, the prison-suppressing stele pressed down again.</p><p>The others wanted to escape, but what they were faced with was an endless Grand formation. If they wanted to break the Grand formation, they would have to spend some time, but this little time would be fatal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele was like a death-pressing stele. It was covered with the early stage of the chaotic domain. An ordinary third level martial Royal realm expert could not withstand it at all. If they were hit, they would either die or be injured.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, I wanted to escape, escape!”</p><p>Seeing that the other experts were killed by Lu Ming one after another, the green-haired middle-aged man panicked and attacked frantically.</p><p>However, the second body was staring at him closely, so how could he escape?</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A formation appeared on the second body, and a beam of sword Qi shot out from the tip of his finger. It almost pierced through the middle of the green-haired middle-aged man’s brows, causing him to break out in cold sweat.</p><p>???!</p><p>Miserable screams rang out continuously before everything quieted down.</p><p>The other third level martial Royal realm experts were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The green-haired middle-aged man was the only one left at the scene.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
