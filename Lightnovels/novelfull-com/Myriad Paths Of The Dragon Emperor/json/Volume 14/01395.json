Kacha. Only a few claw marks appeared on the ice wall. They did not look very deep.</p><p>it’s so hard. Everything in the world of the yuan continent is many times harder than that transit station. It’s incomparable to the continent of the divine Ruins!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming started to practice martial arts to get used to the external pressure.</p><p>After playing for a few hours, Lu Ming finally stopped. He felt very comfortable.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>As soon as he activated the true war Dragon technique, the rich Origin Energy in the air began to gather towards Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>“What a dense Heaven Earth Yuan Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that directly absorbing the original energy of heaven and earth here was better than devouring low-grade raw stones.</p><p>This was too shocking. When one cultivated here, one did not even need low-grade raw stones.</p><p>The rolling original Qi was constantly being devoured and refined, turning into true essence.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s heart sank into a state of emptiness. He began to comprehend the heaven and earth and nurture the embryonic form of the chaos Domain.</p><p>Here, Lu Ming realized that not only did the essence realm of the heaven and earth become extremely clear, but the Dao of the heaven and earth that was even more profound and unfathomable than the essence realm of the heaven and earth also became clearer.</p><p>This was almost impossible to sense on the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Comprehending the great Dao of heaven and earth could allow the emperor’s domain to improve faster.</p><p>It was no wonder that in the divine Ruins continent, the cultivation of emperors was very slow.</p><p>Especially in the divine wilderness continent, most of the sovereigns were stuck at the first level of the martial Royal realm. Those who could reach the second level of the martial Royal realm were all top experts, and there were very few of them.</p><p>It was no wonder that the emperors of the continent group of the divine Ruins would rack their brains to think of the yuan continent and all wanted to join the major sects in the yuan continent to cultivate. It was because the cultivation environment was really incomparable. The difference was too great.</p><p>After those sovereigns came to the yuan continent, their cultivation would probably advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed before Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>it’s so cool! It’s so cool to cultivate here!</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of amazement.</p><p>He realized that half a day of cultivation was equivalent to a month of cultivation in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>His Primal Chaos Domain had become a little more mature, and it was getting closer and closer to full maturity.</p><p>wow, Lu Ming, you’ve arrived in Yuan continent. Haha, you’ve finally left that poor and remote place!</p><p>Lu Ming heard a voice.</p><p>It was dandan. He did not know when she had climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder. She sucked in the air with her mouth and large amounts of original energy were sucked into dandan’s mouth.</p><p>“Dandan, you’re awake!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Since the last battle, dandan had been in a coma for almost a month.</p><p>nonsense. You’ve been unconscious for so long and you’re still not awake. Do you think I’m dead? ”</p><p>Dandan cast a glance at Lu Ming and then said with a long face, ” “Lu Ming, we’ve suffered heavy losses this time. Although you’ve woken up, you’re far from fully recovered. Hurry up and take out all your spiritual herbs!”</p><p>Having said that, his eyes were fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, let’s enter the mountain and river diagram!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and entered the mountain and river diagram with dandan.</p><p>In a Valley, bubbles was still curled up and sleeping soundly. There was a transparent bubble at the tip of his nose that was sometimes big and sometimes small.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached. In the previous battle, this little guy seemed to have suffered a lot of damage.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and the valley was covered with spiritual herbs.</p><p>All kinds of spirit herbs of different grades filled the valley.</p><p>In that battle, hundreds of sovereigns were killed. The spirit herbs in the storage rings were terrifying. Lu Ming took them all out and let dandan and bubbles eat to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re very generous this time!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up, and she immediately rushed into the pile of spirit herbs, grabbed a handful of spirit herbs, and stuffed them into her mouth.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>As if sensing the aura of the spiritual herbs, Paopao woke up and looked at Lu Ming in a daze. Then, she looked at the pile of spiritual herbs in a daze. Her two gem-like eyes glowed brightly and she also pounced into the pile of spiritual herbs, taking big bites.</p><p>However, there were plenty of spirit herbs here, so the two of them ate as much as they could. Soon, their bellies bulged, and they burped as they lay there, their mouths filled with the fragrance of herbs.</p><p>the mountain and river diagram is a space of its own, but the environment seems to be the same as that of the divine wilderness continent. I should absorb some of the original Qi to improve the environment here!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Within the mountain and river diagram, there were mountains, rivers, flowers, and trees.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming caught more demonic beasts and planted many spiritual herbs in the mountains.</p><p>However, the environment here was similar to the divine wilderness continent. Be it the spiritual herbs or the demonic beasts, their growth was slow. If the environment was the same as the yuan continent, the spiritual herbs would definitely grow faster in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and reappeared in the ice cave.</p><p>Then, the mountain and river diagram appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. He opened it and muttered,”Absorb!”</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Suddenly, the mountain and river diagram emitted a powerful suction force, absorbing the original Qi between heaven and earth.</p><p>The original Qi between heaven and earth formed a funnel-like shape and madly gathered toward the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in this yaozhi Valley was alarmed. One by one, the geniuses who had been cultivating were awakened.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why is the origin Qi of heaven and earth gathering in one direction?”</p><p>“Who’s cultivating? Impossible. Even an Emperor couldn’t cause such a huge commotion while cultivating. Who is it?”</p><p>Sounds rang out one after another. Some people walked out of the ice cave and sensed carefully. Although they knew which ice cave it was happening, they didn’t know who it was.</p><p>However, this effect was only limited to this side valley. After all, the original Qi here was too rich, and this side valley was very vast.</p><p>“This … The path-understanding ancient tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Originally, the mountain and river diagram didn’t cause such a big commotion when it absorbed the original Qi of heaven and earth, mainly because of the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree had three crisp leaves. Its branches were very thin, not even as thin as a pinky finger. In the divine wilderness, the growth of the path-understanding ancient tree was too slow.</p><p>But now, the path-understanding ancient tree glowed and shimmered. A mysterious aura lingered on it, continuously absorbing the origin Qi from the outside world. At the same time, Lu Ming sensed that the path-understanding ancient tree seemed to be resonating with the great Dao between heaven and earth. Wisps of great Dao aura emanated from the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>In just a moment, Lu Ming could feel that the branches of the path-understanding ancient tree had grown thicker and the leaves had become greener.</p><p>“The fourth leaf!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes widened. He discovered that the fourth leaf had also grown.</p><p>it seems like the path-understanding ancient tree has a chance of fully growing in the yuan continent. In the divine wilderness continent, it’s already not bad if it can survive!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>If the path-understanding ancient tree could fully grow, it would be of great help to him.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a lot of spiritual liquid and watered the root of the ancient path-understanding tree.</p><p>it seems that I need to get more spiritual herbs in the future and let the path-understanding ancient tree grow as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
