We’ll follow you out and fight to the death with the Xie family!</p><p>The Emperor gritted his teeth and agreed.</p><p>alright then. Let’s not delay any further. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. The strength of the Mosha clan was not weak. They had become stronger out of thin air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The group quickly flew toward the exit of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>Soon, the city at the exit of the abyss Demon Realm was in sight.</p><p>Above the city, there was a light barrier that enveloped the entire city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers were like a sword, and he slashed out. A beam of sword light cut through the void and slashed toward the city.</p><p>The light shield on the city could not withstand Lu Ming’s sword aura at all. It was split open and the remaining power of the sword aura did not stop. It almost split the entire city in half.</p><p>“Enemy attack! Enemy attack!”</p><p>“Prepare for battle!”</p><p>The city was in an uproar as countless powerful auras surged.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest charged toward the city.</p><p>…….</p><p>Above the sacred city, on the platform, Di Yi, Xie Qitian, and the others had already taken their seats.</p><p>To the North of the platform, there was a huge flag that was tens of thousands of feet tall. The huge flag was fluttering in the wind.</p><p>This was the flag of their alliance.</p><p>Di Yi, Xie Qitian, and the others were drinking and waiting.</p><p>They were waiting for Xia Jiuyang and the others to be brought over and killed as a sacrifice. At the same time, they were also waiting for Lu Ming’s arrival.</p><p>All of a sudden, a voice transmission jade talisman appeared in Xie Qitian’s hand. His expression changed as he picked it up.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Di Yi asked.</p><p>someone has rescued Xia Jiuyang and the others, and they are now attacking the passage to the abyss Demon Realm. Brother di, please wait here for a moment. I will go and capture Xia Jiuyang and the others!</p><p>Xie Qitian stood up and was about to lead the experts of the Xie family to the entrance of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>At this moment, many figures appeared in the void outside the sacred city.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie Luan, Yan kuangtu, the Barbarian Emperor, and the other cultivators of the heaven suppressing divine Army also appeared on the other side.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The world rumbled and the void exploded. A pitch-black void passageway extended toward the holy city.</p><p>a light screen appeared above the sacred city, but upon being struck by the spatial passage, it began to shake.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, Xie Luan threw a punch, and a fist force hit the light barrier.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other sovereigns also made their moves at the same time, including the cultivators of the heaven suppressing divine Army. At the same time, more than 20 sovereigns made their moves. It was an earth-shaking scene.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Such a terrifying attack landed on the light screen, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>In the end, the light barrier couldn’t take it anymore and cracks appeared like a spider web. Finally, it exploded with a bang.</p><p>In the sacred city, just as Xie Qitian was about to lead his men to the abyss demon territory, an earth-shaking roar suddenly rang out in the sky. It was like thousands of Heavenly Thunder, as if the sky was going to fall and the earth was going to split apart, and the end of the world was coming.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>In the sacred city, countless people looked up at the sky in fear.</p><p>In the sky, there was an irresistible and vast pressure, making everyone feel that a great disaster was coming.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>Di Yi looked up at the sky.</p><p>“You’ve come at the right time!”</p><p>Xie Qitian also looked up at the sky, his eyes cold.</p><p>Kachaa! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a violent roar in the sky. Pitch-black spatial cracks appeared in the sky, and the scene was spectacular and terrifying.</p><p>Then, one figure after another stepped out of these cracks.</p><p>Each of them exuded an earth-shattering aura, as if they were the rulers of the world.</p><p>Lu Ming! That’s Lu Ming!</p><p>“And Xie Luan!”</p><p>Someone in the sacred city shouted.</p><p>The two people in the lead were Lu Ming and Xie Luan.</p><p>Lu Ming was the most powerful heaven’s favorite among the younger generation. At such a young age, he could kill a Martial Emperor and fight with a peak Lv 2 Martial Emperor. He was an unprecedented heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Xie Luan was a peerless expert from the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty. 30000 years ago, he had single-handedly caused the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty, which had been at its peak, to suffer a disastrous decline, losing control over the world.</p><p>It created a situation where the world’s powerhouses fought for hegemony.</p><p>The two of them were the pinnacle figures of the divine wilderness continent. At that moment, the two of them had come together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying auras soared into the sky. Di Yi and the other emperors of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace released their auras and rose into the sky, standing in the air with Lu Ming, Xie Luan, and the others.</p><p>Among them, Di Yi and the two elders beside him had the most terrifying auras, as if they were the masters of the world. The auras of the three of them alone surpassed that of Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Xie Luan, since you’re here today, stay here forever!” He said.</p><p>The Golden-robed old man said, his killing intent cold.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other side, an old voice came out of a spatial crack. Then, more than ten figures stepped out.</p><p>They were the powerhouses of the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>As soon as the powerhouses of the heaven suppressing divine Army appeared, their auras converged with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Alright, since they’re all here, I’ll settle them all today!”</p><p>Xie Qitian shouted. The experts of the Xie family also rose to the sky and joined Di Yi and the others.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There were about 50 emperors from both sides. Their auras clashed, shaking the entire sacred city.</p><p>Below, in the sacred city, countless people could not resist this pressure. It was as if they were facing the ruler of the world. They could not help but kneel down and tremble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the entire sacred city buzzed and countless lights lit up.</p><p>In the sacred city, countless buildings and streets were covered in inscriptions, forming a large array that protected the sacred city.</p><p>The sacred city had been passed down for millions of years. After the blessings of the past sacred emperors, it could be said that the entire sacred city was covered with inscription formations and was indestructible.</p><p>Inscriptions filled the air, and the formation appeared. Only then did the people in the sacred city feel less pressured.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Many people heaved a long sigh of relief and found that they were all drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>A confrontation between dozens of emperors was too terrifying. This had only happened a few times in the history of the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“I’m afraid the heavens will fall today!”</p><p>Some people sighed, knowing that an earth-shaking battle would happen today.</p><p>“Lu Ming, even if you come, you can’t save Xia Jiuyang today. He must die today!”</p><p>Di Yi’s voice was heard. He looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A clear voice was heard. However, it did not come from Lu Ming’s main body. It came from another direction.</p><p>The sound of air being torn could be heard as figures flew over and revealed themselves.</p><p>“Then … It’s Lu Ming, another Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
