It lay on Lu Ming’s shoulder and fell into a deep sleep. The milky white glow on its body became more and more intense.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to take a nap too to digest the energy in my body!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were blurred and she climbed onto Lu Ming’s other shoulder.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait for me. When I wake up again, I’ll be able to enter the Emperor realm!”</p><p>Dandan continued to mumble, her voice getting softer and softer.</p><p>These two fellows had consumed too many spirit herbs during this period of time, and in addition to nearly a pool of nectar, it was finally time for them to evolve.</p><p>After muttering to herself, dandan also fell asleep on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming kept dandan and Paopao into the mountain and river diagram. Then, he let the sea suppressing divine ape lead the way and collected the remaining spiritual herbs in the vicinity.</p><p>Anyway, the sea suppressing divine ape was going to leave with him. It would be a waste to leave these spirit herbs here.</p><p>He flew out of the sea.</p><p>little ape, bring me along. I’ll give you this Sea Map. Bring me to the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Lu Ming said to the sea suppressing divine ape.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape almost spat out a mouthful of blood. Little ape? Was this the name she had given him?</p><p>However, the sea suppressing divine ape could only helplessly accept this name under the pressure of power.</p><p>Lu Ming asked Supreme Thunder rhinoceros to return to the mountain and river diagram to rest, while the sea suppressing divine ape carried Lu Ming and hurried on with their journey.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape was an Emperor, and its speed was several times faster than Supreme Thunder Rhino’s.</p><p>Originally, the journey would take more than two months, but the sea-guarding divine ape only used half a month to cross it.</p><p>In front of them, a huge continent could be seen in the distance.</p><p>They had arrived at the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>After half a month of cultivation, Lu Ming’s pure spirit body had finally reached fifty percent.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming let the sea suppressing divine ape enter the mountain and river diagram and switched to the Thunder Rhino Supreme.</p><p>The sea suppressing divine ape was, after all, an Emperor. Riding it into the divine wilderness continent would be too ostentatious and would cause a commotion.</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros was a bit better.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros stepped into the void and carried Lu Ming as he flew towards the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“I’m finally back!”</p><p>Xie nianqing stood beside Lu Ming and mumbled to himself. There was a complicated look in his eyes.</p><p>Now that she was back, it was time to settle the score between her and the Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros stepped into the void and flew into the divine wilderness continent. Countless mountains and rivers flashed beneath his feet.</p><p>This place was the Northern Plains of the divine wilderness continent. Lu Ming guided Supreme Thunder Rhino towards the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Xie Luan and the others should be guarding the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Not long after, they were close to the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Along the way, he noticed that something was wrong.</p><p>There was something wrong with the atmosphere. Many large places and cities were heavily guarded, as if a storm was brewing.</p><p>“Who’s there? Stop!”</p><p>“Not good, it’s a Supreme-being expert!”</p><p>Suddenly, a few loud roars were heard. A group of armored soldiers rushed out from a large mountain in front of them and blocked Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>When they sensed the aura of Supreme Thunder Rhino, their expressions changed.</p><p>“Send word that an unknown Paragon is attacking!”</p><p>An armored soldier shouted.</p><p>“No, that’s not right. That’s handsome Lu! Lu Ming, handsome Lu …”</p><p>At this moment, someone exclaimed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The other soldiers all turned to look at the figure on Supreme lightning Rhino’s back.</p><p>Just a moment ago, they had been so shocked by the aura of Supreme Thunder Rhino that they hadn’t noticed his back. Now that they’d seen it, they were all stunned.</p><p>“It’s really general Lu. How is that possible? Didn’t the experts of the continent of Divine Ruins spread the news that general Lu died in battle there?”</p><p>“That’s right, how is he still alive? But I’ve seen general Lu before, so I’m not wrong!”</p><p>“I’ve seen him before too. This is general Lu!”</p><p>The hundreds of armored soldiers clamored as they looked at Lu Ming in shock and doubt.</p><p>“I died in battle on the continent of the divine Ruins? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He felt that something was not right.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of the armored soldiers. The hundreds of armored soldiers were shocked and could not help but retreat.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. What are you afraid of? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Are you really general Lu?”</p><p>Some of the armored soldiers were still bewildered.</p><p>“Nonsense! Quickly spread the news and have the chaotic heavens divine warrior come!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>These were only ordinary soldiers and didn’t know much. They wouldn’t be able to explain it clearly, so it was better to ask Xie Huan directly.</p><p>Alright, alright, we’ll immediately spread the news!</p><p>A leader-like armored soldier quickly took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent out a message.</p><p>Not even ten breaths had passed.</p><p>Si la! “Hiss!”</p><p>The space rippled, and cracks appeared. One figure after another walked out of the cracks.</p><p>Every one of them exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Xie Luan!</p><p>Lu Ming saw at a glance that the person in the lead was Xie Luan.</p><p>Apart from that, Lu Ming also saw Mo Ye, the sovereign of the myriad demons abyss, qu Luo, the sovereign of the demon God Valley, the Barbarian Emperor, the sovereign of the hundred beasts tribe, and the sovereign of the floating mountain sect, the moon Heart Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Why is Martial Emperor Yuexin here?”</p><p>A trace of doubt flashed across Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“Big brother Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming also saw Yan kuangtu and a few other Supreme-being experts.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on Lu Ming the moment they appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming! It’s really Lu Ming!</p><p>“Lu Ming did not die!”</p><p>One voice after another came out from the mouths of the crowd. They were filled with shock and surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew you would be fine!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu was overjoyed to see Lu Ming, and he charged toward him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Supreme Thunder rhinoceros roared, his entire body suffused with lightning as he cautiously stared at Yan kuangtu. Yan kuangtu couldn’t help but stop in his tracks.</p><p>“Lei Xi, it’s one of us, you step down!”</p><p>Lu Ming instructed Supreme Thunder Rhino.</p><p>Supreme lightning rhinoceros immediately became obedient. He retracted his aura and transformed into a burly man, standing behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>“He’s a Paragon!”</p><p>Quluo, the Barbarian Emperor, and the others glanced at Supreme Thunder Rhino in surprise.</p><p>A Supreme-being seemed to be very obedient in front of Lu Ming. Lu Ming actually had such great abilities to subdue a Supreme-being and make him so obedient. This was very rare.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, I knew that you would be fine!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed heartily. He came to Lu Ming’s side and patted his shoulder. He picked up the wine gourd and took a big gulp.</p><p>“Big brother Yan, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Yan kuangtu’s concern could not be concealed. It was true, and Lu Ming’s heart warmed.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan, qu Luo, and the others also stepped forward and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets all the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and looked at Martial Emperor Yuexin. “What a coincidence, senior Yuexin is also in the hundred beasts tribe?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
