His three eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hands and he thrust it out.</p><p>The shocking spear radiance destroyed the opponent’s axe radiance in one fell swoop and pierced through the opponent’s glabella.</p><p>Instant kill!</p><p>Then, with a sweep of his world power, he put away the other party’s storage bracelet and dug out the other party’s crystal core.</p><p>damn it! This person has the battle power of a rank 14 true Emperor!</p><p>One of the ambushers roared.</p><p>Initially, they had thought that Lu Ming’s combat strength would not be that high since he was so young. They would be able to easily deal with him if they sent a rank-12 true Emperor expert.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to resolve it easily.</p><p>“Send more people to kill this person. Hurry up, don’t be discovered by the other people in the heaven realm!”</p><p>An alien ordered.</p><p>Immediately, some alien races charged out and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, there were six of them.</p><p>“There’s more!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The six alien races burst with a shocking aura and charged toward Lu Ming. From a distance, six beams of destructive light blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! ; Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear and shot out beams of spear radiance at the alien race’s destructive light.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of collisions occurred. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>“Two at rank 15 true Emperor and four at rank 14 true Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he determined the other party’s strength.</p><p>Such a formation was more than enough to deal with a rank-14.</p><p>However, their opponent was Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was injured, his injuries were recovering rapidly and he was not in any serious condition.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The six alien races charged at Lu Ming with all kinds of attacks, trying to drown him.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. He held his spear and charged over.</p><p>The two sides continued to clash and kill each other.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was at a disadvantage, it was impossible for the alien race to kill him in a short time.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Lu Ming risked his injuries and killed a rank-14 true Emperor alien in the air with one shot.</p><p>damn it, how can this human from the heaven realm be so strong? his vitality is unbelievably tenacious!</p><p>Some of the non-humankind beings who were lying in ambush roared in anger. Then, more non-humankind beings rushed out.</p><p>This time, there were more than a dozen of them. The strongest one had the battle power of a rank 16 true Emperor.</p><p>so many? could this be the nest of the alien race? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>There were so many alien races, and some of them even had the combat power of a level 16 true Emperor. Lu Ming was obviously not their match.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming knocked back a rank-14 martial artist with a single shot. He then charged forward at top speed. At the same time, the fallen star bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the fallen star bow and nine Nine Nine-colored arrows flew out. They were aimed at a rank fifteen true Emperor alien.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This foreign being was shot to death in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming drew his bow continuously. The bowstring vibrated and a few arrows flew out in succession. Each arrow killed one alien.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Those alien races who had been lying in ambush couldn’t sit still any longer. Some of the more terrifying ones were even more furious.</p><p>“Charge out and kill this person!”</p><p>A leader-level non-human shouted and rushed out.</p><p>This time, more than 200 foreign races rushed out from the surrounding mountains. Each of them had a combat strength above level 10 true Emperor.</p><p>The strongest had even reached the fighting power of a rank 17 true Emperor.</p><p>“So many!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression really changed.</p><p>A few hundred alien races all at the same time, and all of them were at least a tenth stage true Emperor. This was definitely not a coincidence. They had been lying in ambush here for a long time.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not know what had happened, he knew very well that he was unlucky and had accidentally walked into an ambush of the alien races.</p><p>Hundreds of alien races, all of which had the combat strength of a tenth level true Emperor or above, charged at Lu Ming from all directions. The entire void was shaking as if there were an Army of thousands of soldiers.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>One of the alien race members shouted. This person had the appearance of a human and purple hair. He was actually a member of the Royal race.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A few beams of destructive light burst out, causing the void to tremble continuously.</p><p>A stone sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. At the same time, the celestial Thearch’s physical body emerged and floated in front of Lu Ming, growing in size.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body merged into the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to be a match for so many foreign tribe powerhouses. He would probably be drowned by the attacks of so many foreign tribes in an instant and be blown up by so many attacks.</p><p>The only way was to use the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Controlling the celestial Thearch’s physical body, Lu Ming slashed with his sword.</p><p>A beam of sword Qi, vast and mighty, pierced through the clouds, broke through the attack of the foreign tribe, and slashed towards the group of foreign tribe members.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A few of the alien races, who were all level 10 true emperors, were cut in half by the sword Qi.</p><p>At this moment, a group of people arrived not far away.</p><p>This group of people were the experts from the LAN and Yan families. There were dozens of them, and there was no lack of terrifying true Emperor experts.</p><p>The experts from the LAN and Yan families were also looking for the entrance to the small world.</p><p>They could see the mighty sword Qi from afar.</p><p>there’s a battle between experts ahead. What terrifying power! Be careful to hide!</p><p>One of the LAN family’s experts said in a low voice.</p><p>These people immediately concealed their auras and carefully flew forward. They then landed on a mountain peak and looked ahead.</p><p>At a glance, they saw Lu Ming controlling the celestial Thearch’s physical body to fight against the alien race.</p><p>Of course, they did not recognize Lu Ming as he had merged into the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>When they saw so many alien races, they were almost scared to death.</p><p>“There’s a wondrous spatial fluctuation up ahead. Could the entrance to the small world be here? Could it be that these foreign races are lying in ambush here, trying to ambush and kill the powerhouses of our heaven realm?”</p><p>The LAN family and the Yan family could easily think of this key point.</p><p>Their faces turned pale at the thought of this.</p><p>They understood that someone had barged into this place first, or they would be finished.</p><p>who’s that giant Golem? what powerful battle prowess!</p><p>“That should be a puppet!”</p><p>The experts from the LAN and Yan families discussed in low voices.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had killed a few more alien races in a row, which infuriated the alien races.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The non-human King roared.</p><p>All the alien races made their moves. Hundreds of attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>All of these attacks were from beings above the tenth level of the true Emperor realm. The power was so shocking that even ordinary great emperors didn’t dare to take them head-on and could only Dodge.</p><p>However, Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was still Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body. Furthermore, it was made of stone and was extremely sturdy. Even great emperors couldn’t penetrate it, let alone true emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the attacks from all directions. He held the celestial Emperor’s sword and rushed toward the alien race.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and slashed out with his sword. The sword ray was a hundred miles long and the three alien races were blown up in the air..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
