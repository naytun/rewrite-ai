Then, he slashed his sword horizontally and lulled two more alien races.</p><p>The attacks of rhe hundreds of outsiders landed on the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, causing loud rumbles. However, rhe celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was completely fine.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat sword did not stop and he kept slashing.</p><p>The huge sword light was as big as a mountain. It swept across rhe sky with shocking power.</p><p>Over the years, Lu Ming would find some time to integrate the energy from the energy crystals he obtained from the alien races into the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s corporeal body’s energy was already close to thirty percent. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>As the mountain-like sword light pressed down, the bodies of the non-humankind beings exploded one after another, and they died on the spot.</p><p>In a few breaths, dozens of foreign kinds were killed.</p><p>No matter what combat strength they had, they could not withstand one move from Lu Ming.</p><p>When close to thirty percent of the energy in the celestial Thearch’s physical body erupted, even an ordinary one-star great emperor would be in danger. Lu Ming could kill him, let alone a true Emperor.</p><p>The battle power of a level 18 true Emperor was only equivalent to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Even the most powerful rank 18 was only at rhe peak of true Emperor, and they would still be killed in seconds.</p><p>Therefore, no matter what combat level they were at, there was only one outcome when they faced Lu Ming, and that was to be killed in seconds. They were invincible.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming shouted. Like a tiger among a flock of sheep, he charged and killed wantonly. His combat sword kept slashing out, and every slash took the life of a few outsiders.</p><p>In less than a minute, more than a hundred of the more than two hundred alien races had died under Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!1’</p><p>The remaining alien race members finally panicked. They shouted in fear and turned to run.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on the alien royal family.</p><p>The number of Royal non-human races was pathetically small, bur without a doubt, each of them had shocking talent. Once they reached adulthood, they would have terrifying battle power.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites among them were even more terrifying. Since he saw them, he couldn’t let them go.</p><p>Lu Ming chased after the alien Royal.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>The non-human King was terrified. He ran for his life and ordered the other non-human races to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>In the foreign races, rhe hierarchy was strict and unusual.</p><p>The status of a member of the royal family was extremely precious. The ordinary people and rhe aristocrats of the evil god tribe had to obey rhe royal family unconditionally.</p><p>In the face of danger , he had to stand in front of the royal family unconditionally. Otherwise, there would be a great disaster.</p><p>At that moment, although the other alien races were frightened, they still rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Among them, there was no lack of level 17 true Emperor battle strength.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming showed no mercy. He charged forward and slashed with his combat sword, killing one alien race after another.</p><p>Among them, there was even an existence with the battle power of a rank 17 true Emperor.</p><p>In the battlefield of true emperors, a rank 17 true Emperor was already the peak of battle power.</p><p>This was because a rank 18 true Emperor had reached the peak of true Emperor in all aspects. Most of them were in seclusion, preparing to break through to the great emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was invincible in the true Emperor stage when he controlled the celestial Thearch’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed past them and killed dozens of true emperors. He then rushed toward the non-human Royal clan.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The non-human King screamed in fear, but he was still cut in half by the sword.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The other non-humans fled in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and did not continue to pursue.</p><p>The intense battle just now had consumed a lot of the energy of the heaven and earth body.</p><p>These foreign kinds had the combat strength of a tenth level true Emperor or above. It seemed easy for Lu Ming to kill them, but he had to consume a lot of energy.</p><p>After killing more than a hundred non-human powerhouses, the energy of the celestial Thearch’s body was almost exhausted.</p><p>Killing so many true Emperor realm experts was no easier than fighting a one star great emperor.</p><p>By now, the energy in Celestial Emperor s corporeal body was almost completely depleted.</p><p>After the alien race had fled far away, Lu Ming’s figure appeared and he kept the celestial Thearch body.</p><p>it seems like there should be an entrance to a small world here. These foreign races have been lying in ambush in this vicinity in order to kill rhe beings of the heaven realm!</p><p>On second thought, Lu Ming could guess the alien race s plan.</p><p>At this moment, the people from the LAN family and the Yan family widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s that Lu Ming!”</p><p>it’s him! He has such a terrifying puppet!</p><p>The faces of the LAN and Yan family members turned pale.</p><p>They had received orders to kill Lu Ming if they had the chance in the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>However, Lu Ming actually had such a powerful puppet, which left them with a lingering fear. If they had attacked Lu Ming, they would have been dead.</p><p>that’s not right. T here must be a condition to control such a powerful puppet. It’s impossible to control it so easily!</p><p>just now, the alien race escaped, but he didn’t pursue them. This doesn’t seem like him. Could it be that the puppet can’t be used anymore? ”</p><p>“Controlling a puppet requires energy, and energy will be exhausted!’’</p><p>The LAN family and the Yan family were communicating in secret.</p><p>Some of these people had already lived for hundreds of thousands of years, and some even millions of years. They were all experienced and sly old foxes, so they could guess the general situation in a few moments.</p><p>Their eyes lit up and were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>This was a great opportunity. If Lu Ming’s puppet could no longer be controlled, it would be the best time to kill him.</p><p>“Let s go all out!”</p><p>The experts from the LAN and Yan families were determined.</p><p>Their higher-ups had given the order to find an opportunity to kill Lu Ming and strip him of the indestructible ancient scroll in his soul. If they could complete the task, they would be rewarded handsomely.</p><p>Now that there was no one else from heaven around and Lu Ming’s puppet could nor be used, it was the best time to make a move.</p><p>“Go and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family sent a message to the crowd and then rushed out.</p><p>The others also rushed out.</p><p>Beams of rainbow light shot toward Lu Ming at high speed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming was about to head to the small world when he suddenly realized that there were dozens of people flying in his direction. He could not help but be stunned.</p><p>He did not recognize these people as the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>The LAN family and the Yan family did not have any special symbols. These people were all true emperors. Lu Ming had never seen them before.</p><p>He had thought that the other party was just an ordinary person from the heaven realm.</p><p>“Are these people also here for the small world?”</p><p>Lu Ming s heart stirred.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The people from the LAN family and the Yan family stopped not far away from Lu Ming. They did not make a move immediately. They were still a little afraid of Lu Ming’s methods.</p><p>“You are… Lu Ming?”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family pretended to have just recognized Lu Ming and asked with a surprised look.</p><p>“That’s me. May 1 know why everyone is here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m Zuo Zheng!”</p><p>T he leader of the LAN family lied. He walked toward Lu Ming with a smile on his face and said, recently, there has been a rumor that a small world that has been floating in the eternal void for countless years has connected to the battlefield of rhe true Emperor. Perhaps there are extraordinary treasures there, so many people have come. Brother Lu, you must be here for this small world!</p><p>The leader of the LAN family always had a smile on his face. He was very gentle and made people feel like they were bathing in the spring breeze..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
