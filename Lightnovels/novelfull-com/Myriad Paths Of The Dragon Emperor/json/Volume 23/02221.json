She glided over with a bright smile on her face.”Lu Ming, have you recovered from your injuries? 1 went to see you two days ago and saw that you were still cultivating!”</p><p>“I’m completely fine!”</p><p>“It’s been many years since we last met. Senior Sister, you’ve become even more beautiful!” Lu Ming smiled and teased her.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Mu Lan’s smile grew wider. She then pretended to sigh and said, “It’s a pity that some people don’t knowhow to appreciate it!”</p><p>“How could this be? Who doesn’t know how to appreciate it? they’re simply blind!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to smile, which made Mu Lan’s smile even brighter.</p><p>right, where’s senior evil swordsman? how’s his injury? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>you’ve come at a bad time. Senior evil swordsman left yesterday and returned to the ancient battlefield with Jian feiliu!</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>“He left?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>senior evil swordsman said that he’d better live in that ancient battlefield, where he’s more free!</p><p>Mu Lan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Perhaps evil swordsman had many comrades in that ancient battlefield. In the war that year, countless people had died and countless friends had been buried there. How could he not feel pain?</p><p>senior evil swordsman also said that although that passage has completely collapsed, it’s estimated that it’ll reappear in a hundred years!</p><p>Mu Lan said again, frowning.</p><p>On the other side of the passage was Yuan continent, where her family and friends were.</p><p>a hundred years. The Outlanders won’t be able to get through in a hundred years!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes opened and closed, revealing a strong sense of confidence.</p><p>“Oh, Senior Sister apprentice, 1 11 leave here soon, come with us!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Mu Lan nodded.</p><p>Now that she had obtained the inheritance of a peerless master, her cultivation was already at the limit of Emperor-to-be, it was only a matter of time before she became an Emperor.</p><p>Once one became a monarch, as long as they survived the heavenly Monarch tribulation, they would have a longlifespan.</p><p>So now, she would no longer run away. She wanted to grasp her own happiness.</p><p>The two of them went back to the courtyard where Lu Ming used to be and found dandan.</p><p>Not long after, they found songTianlong and bade him farewell. They then flew toward the east of two world city.</p><p>In ancient times, dandan knew a person who had not even become a sovereign but had already mastered many laws.</p><p>That person had been researching for his entire life. In his later years, he made a major breakthrough and might be able to help Lu Ming find a way to become a saint Emperor.</p><p>Now, they were going to that person’s family to find that method.</p><p>That family was located in the southern part of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>The Tai Qing heavenly region could be said to be the largest heavenly region among the nine heavenly regions in rhe heaven realm. It was as vast as the yuan continent.</p><p>The two world city was located in the westernmost parr of rhe Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Not long after, they flew our of the two world city. What came into view were vast mountains. The peaks rose into the clouds one after another, as if there was no end to them.</p><p>the heaven realm’s original Qi is indeed richer than rhe primordial realm’s, and the nomological laws are also clearer. Perhaps only the strongest land in rhe primordial realm’s ten lands, the land of divine destiny, can compare!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Then, the three of them took to the air and flew away.</p><p>He was very familiar with the heaven realm.</p><p>They flew over mountains and there was a public teleportation area. They were going to rake the teleportation array to the South of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Half a month later, they had arrived at the southern part of the Tai Qing heavenly region and were flying in an isolated area.</p><p>At a glance, this place was a boundless sea of bamboo.</p><p>Whether it was a high mountain or a plain, it was covered with bamboo. There were all kinds of bamboo.</p><p>“Dandan, we’ve been searching for so many days? Did you take rhe wrong way?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“How is that possible? The Gu family is in this area, living in seclusion in a purple bamboo forest. They won t move if there’s no major problem! ”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>The three of them looked around, searching for rhe purple bamboo forest.</p><p>Another half a day passed.</p><p>“I found it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and flew forward.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mu Lan followed him. Soon, a sea of bamboo appeared in front of them. It was all purple bamboo.</p><p>At first glance, it was a Purple Ocean.</p><p>It was a purple bamboo, and even irs leaves were purple. The bamboo pole was sparkling and translucent, as if it was carved our of beautiful purple jade.</p><p>In the depths of the bamboo forest, they saw a Palace. It was extremely elegant and was embellished in the boundless Purple Ocean.</p><p>“Haha, so many years have passed, and they are still here. Let’s go!”</p><p>Dandan smiled and flew towards the palace.</p><p>But before they could fly far, a few figures rushed out from the bamboo forest below and blocked them.</p><p>There were a total of three people, one middle-aged man and two young men.</p><p>They all had one thing in common. They all wore Jade crowns and white robes, looking very refined.</p><p>“How many of you? This is my home, may I know why you have come to my home?”</p><p>The middle-aged man cupped his fists and said politely.</p><p>“We came to my home to find someone, of course! ”</p><p>Dandan said casually.</p><p>“Looking for someone? I wonder who you are looking for?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>Lone Star sky, are Gu Xingyue and the others around? I’ll come and find them!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>His words made the three Gu family members expressions change drastically, becoming somewhat unsightly.</p><p>little brother, the two you mentioned are my Gu family’s ancestors. Moreover, it’s too disrespectful for you to call them by their names!</p><p>The middle-aged man’s eyes flashed with anger, but he suppressed it and said unhappily.</p><p>“What disrespect? They are just my juniors. If 1 don’t call them by their names, what should I call them?”</p><p>Dandan pouted.</p><p>How dare you? I think you’re here to find trouble. Do you really think that my family is easy to bully? ”</p><p>A young man shouted angrily. At the same time, a long sword appeared in his hand, and sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s expression was also very ugly.</p><p>How old did she look? He actually said that the two ancestors of the Gu family were his juniors. It was obvious that he was here to find trouble and insult the Gu family.</p><p>“Nest, 1’11 tell you the truth. These people actually want to fight…”</p><p>Dandan cried out.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. How could you say that? It would be strange if others weren’t angry at you for saying this.</p><p>At this time, in the depths of rhe sea of bamboo, there were figures flying out.</p><p>It was obvious that the commotion here had alarmed the Gu family.</p><p>There were dozens of people in total, some old and some young, but they all had one thing in common. They all wore snow-white long robes. No matter if they were men or women, they all looked very elegant.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>An old man with a flowing white beard asked.</p><p>Before the Gu family’s people could answer, dandan shouted first,” they’re called the Lone Star sky. Gu Xingyue, come out and see me. My old friends are here to see them!</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“How dare you insult my Gu family’s ancestor!”</p><p>Instantly, the Gu family members were all furious and roared angrily.</p><p>“What? Ancestor, could it be that Gu Xingyue and Gu Xingkong are both dead? no way!”</p><p>Dandan shouted..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
