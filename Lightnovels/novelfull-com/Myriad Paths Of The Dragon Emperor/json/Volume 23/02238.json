The lightning here did not pose any pressure to him.</p><p>As for bubbles, she was a space-time spirit mouse, so she naturally did not feel any pressure.</p><p>Gu yingzhong was a top-tier heaven’s favorite, so he didn’t feel any pressure either.</p><p>Mu Lan had inherited the legacy of a peerless powerhouse. Her battle prowess was also very strong, and she also advanced with ease.</p><p>However, the others were not as relaxed.</p><p>Many people vomited blood from being struck by the lightning, and their bodies were charred black. They had no choice but to retreat to the platform.</p><p>Some people were unwilling to give up. They wanted to step on the air and rush up, but they realized that it was impossible. A powerful force was suppressing them, making them unable to fly.</p><p>Many people had no choice but to stop, knowing that they had no fate with the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>Some of the stronger heaven’s favorites continued to advance.</p><p>Especially those who could control multiple laws and even an ultimate law. Their speed was extremely fast and they kept rising.</p><p>The four of them, Lu Ming and Pao Pao, moved forward at a uniform speed.</p><p>The higher they went, the more powerful the lightning became.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Lightning streaked across the sky, striking at Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by laws and he had set up a defense. The lightning could not break through his defense at all.</p><p>Pao Pao and the rest followed Lu Ming and kept moving forward.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>arghh! a young man cried out as he was charred Black by the lightning and his body almost cracked. He cried out as he was sent flying and crashed onto the stage, but he did not die.</p><p>In this place, at most, he would be severely injured. He would not die.</p><p>Every time they advanced, there would be people who would be blasted down.</p><p>No one knew how long this ancient path was. Lu Ming and the rest walked for three days, during which they were constantly struck by lightning.</p><p>Three days later, at least half of the people were eliminated.</p><p>After three days of walking, the lightning finally stopped.</p><p>However, before they could celebrate, the temperature on the ancient road dropped sharply as they continued to move forward. An endless chill drilled into their bodies, trying to freeze them.</p><p>As they continued to move forward, the coldness decreased even more, and the temperature dropped to a shocking level.</p><p>Someone couldn’t resist it. His entire body was frozen and turned into an ice sculpture. Then, with a bang, the frozen person was thrown out.</p><p>He was probably thrown off the platform.</p><p>hu hu…</p><p>A cold wind blew over, and it was bone-chilling. There were even snowflakes falling from the sky.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>A young man screamed as he was almost cut in half by a snowflake. He spat out blood and was sent flying.</p><p>These snowflakes were even sharper than the heavenly blade. Every piece of the void was a great killing weapon.</p><p>Everyone focused their attention to block. All kinds of attacks were constantly blasted out, colliding with the snowflakes and producing clanging sounds.</p><p>Some people couldn’t resist and were blown down, while others carried the snowflakes and continued forward.</p><p>The further they went, the more concentrated the snowflakes became. In the end, the sky was filled with snow, and the power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The snowflakes landed on Lu Ming’s defense law. They were like extremely sharp weapons, cutting at Lu Ming’s defense law and producing the sound of metal clashing.</p><p>At the same time, there was a bone-chilling cold that wanted to rush into Lu Ming’s body, but he blocked it with the power of law.</p><p>There were fewer and fewer people who could reach this point.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that the situation of the other eight ancient roads was exactly the same as them. The tests they had experienced were also the same.</p><p>Just like that, a few more days passed. They crossed the land of ice, but what they faced was a land of flames.</p><p>In front of him, the flames were burning fiercely, and the power was shocking.</p><p>Every time he passed a region, the test he faced in the next region would be stronger.</p><p>At this point, Mu Lan began to struggle.</p><p>After all, she had just become a saint Emperor. Her comprehension of the laws was slightly weaker, and it was already a bit forced.</p><p>As they continued to move forward, Mu Lan’s face started to turn pale.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, if you can’t withstand it, don’t force yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m fine, I can still hold on!”</p><p>Mu Lan stubbornly raised her head and continued to walk forward.</p><p>After a few more days, they crossed the area and arrived at a place with strong winds.</p><p>The endless wind was like countless sharp weapons, cutting them with even more terrifying power.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming had to be serious.</p><p>Mu Lan, on the other hand, was finally unable to withstand the attack. With a muffled groan, she retreated. The violent wind cut a few wounds on her body, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, don’t force yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. They could not help each other here. They could only rely on themselves.</p><p>Mu Lan gritted her teeth and sighed in the end. She took a step forward and leaped backward.</p><p>This was equivalent to admitting defeat. A force appeared out of thin air and pulled on Mu Lan, and her figure disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, and the lonely shadow continued to move forward.</p><p>This road was very long, as if there was no end.</p><p>The few of them continued forward and experienced all sorts of trials. There were places filled with poison, places filled with curses, and also mountains of blades and seas of swords …</p><p>After nearly a month, Gu yingchong finally couldn’t resist and was sent flying.</p><p>Only a few people were left on this road.</p><p>It was the same for the other lanes. There were not many people left.</p><p>For example, LAN Yun and Yan Xi had been eliminated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming saw that Yuan Xin and Tianming were still persevering.</p><p>After a few days, there were only three people left on Lu Ming’s path.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, and an extremely beautiful woman.</p><p>This woman’s talent was also astonishingly high. She had mastered more laws than Gu yingchong, and her maturity was even more profound, which was why she could reach this point.</p><p>The other eight paths were about the same. There were only a few people left in each path.</p><p>“The road has reached its end!”</p><p>Suddenly, the beautiful woman’s eyes lit up.</p><p>There was no path ahead. The ancient path had already come to an end.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face also revealed a look of joy.</p><p>At this moment, a figure reappeared.</p><p>congratulations on passing the first test. Next, it’s time for the second test!</p><p>With that, the ancient road in front of Lu Ming and the rest suddenly wriggled. Then, three platforms appeared.</p><p>Three, one for each person.</p><p>It was the same for the other ancient roads. The number of people would determine the number of platforms.</p><p>choose a platform at will and place your palm on it!</p><p>The figure said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest went forward and randomly chose a platform. They then placed their palms on the platform.</p><p>The platform was smooth and cold to the touch.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When their palms touched the platform, the platform emitted an infinite amount of light. Countless runes appeared on it, following Lu Ming’s palms and enveloping their bodies.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that the world was spinning. The surrounding environment had changed. He had arrived in a void.</p><p>In the void, there were rays of light shining. Then, a ray of light suddenly rushed toward Lu Ming like a sharp sword.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He quickly released his holy power, controlled the law, and slapped out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ray of light was sent flying by Lu Ming’s palm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
