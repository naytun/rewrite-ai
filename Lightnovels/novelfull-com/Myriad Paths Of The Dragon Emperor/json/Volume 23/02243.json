It would be a waste to give it to someone else.</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was filled with confidence.</p><p>ridiculous, ridiculous. You’re a cripple and will never become a saint Emperor. I don’t know where your confidence comes from!</p><p>LAN Yun couldn’t hold back and immediately retorted, his words filled with ridicule.</p><p>“That’s right. It’s better to give the indestructible ancient scroll to any one of us than to keep it with you. You’re a cripple, do you understand?”</p><p>Yan Xi followed suit.</p><p>“Crippled body? hehe, you’re all losers. You’re not even as good as a crippled body. I don’t understand how you still have the face to shout in front of me. If 1 were you, I’d kill myself. What’s the point of staying in this world? to embarrass yourself?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>right, good scolding, good scolding. These guys were stripped naked by me back then, but they still have the face to come out and see people. I’m really convinced. 1 didn’t even help them up. I’m convinced by them!</p><p>Dandan cried out.</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi’s faces were flushed red. They were so ashamed and indignant that they wanted to find a hole to hide in.</p><p>“You have a sharp tongue, but the facts have proven that you are a cripple!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s celestial Thearch said coldly.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll challenge all of them here today. Whoever can defeat me will be able to obtain the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke at this moment, his gaze sweeping across the young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge all the talents. How bold. Was he crazy?</p><p>A few months ago, Lu Ming had defeated Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi, who had joined forces and displayed an extremely powerful combat ability.</p><p>However, Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi were only four-star void emperors.</p><p>However, the young heaven’s pride experts present were at least half of the heaven realm’s heaven’s pride experts. Among them, there was no lack of five star, six star, and even Seven Star void emperors.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was definitely not a match for these people because the difference in strength was too great.</p><p>“He’s really arrogant!”</p><p>One of the young geniuses spoke coldly. He wanted to attack immediately and teach Lu Ming a lesson.</p><p>alright, you said it. If you lose, you’ll have to obediently let us strip you of the indestructible ancient scroll. Hengyu, don’t interfere when the time comes!</p><p>The LAN clan’s celestial Thearch said coldly.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll was contained in the heaven path mark of the undying venerable Emperor and had already fused with Lu Ming’s soul. If he were to forcefully strip it off, Lu Ming’s soul would definitely be severely injured or even disintegrate and he would die on the spot.</p><p>However, the LAN family’s celestial Thearch would not consider this. What did Lu Ming’s life and death have to do with him?</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor glanced at Lu Ming, then nodded, then let’s do it this way. Let the young people solve their own problems!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Then, the LAN family’s celestial Thearch spoke. A wave of energy spread out and everyone retreated, giving Lu Ming enough space.</p><p>“Who wants to fight first? LAN Yun, Yan Xi, weren’t you two making a big fuss? come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at LAN Yun and Yan Xi.</p><p>Their expressions turned even uglier. However, they understood that they were no match for Lu Ming. They would only be looking for a beating if they went up. Why would they go up?</p><p>“Arrogant! I’ll defeat you!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. A young man with short hair took a step forward and came before Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was the young man who had pointed out that Lu Ming had obtained the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>His heart was filled with jealousy, but at the same time, he was also extremely greedy. He wanted to take the indestructible ancient scroll for himself.</p><p>Now that he had the chance, he was naturally the first to rush out.</p><p>“You’re just in time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He did not know this person, but this person put Lu Ming in danger because of his greed. How could Lu Ming not take revenge for this?</p><p>It was a good time to torture this person!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took action immediately. He stepped into the void and charged toward the short-haired youth like a cannonball at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Hmph! the short-haired young man snorted coldly and retreated quickly. At the same time, he quickly formed a seal with his hands. A figure suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a figure in iron armor. He was more than two meters tall and held a huge iron sword in his hand. He swung the sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword Qi whistled through the air with astonishing power.</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and used five types of laws.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with the armored figure. The armored figure was sent flying by Lu Ming, and his attack was blocked.</p><p>“This is… Undead!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The armored figure was not a living creature at all, because there was no life force in it. It was a dead spirit full of death Qi.</p><p>At this moment, the short-haired young man continued to form hand seals. Two more two-meter-tall figures in iron armor appeared in the air. They were both wearing iron armor and holding a thick sword.</p><p>“This is … A puppet? No, he was summoned. This person controls the law of summoning and the law of death. This is a spell!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. In an instant, he figured out the key point.</p><p>The short-haired young man had mastered several laws, one of which was the death law, one of the strongest laws. When combined with the summoning law, he could summon dead spirits to fight.</p><p>At this moment, the three undead spirits charged at Lu Ming at the same time. Their iron swords were held in the air and their power was shocking.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed three fingers in a row. Three finger forces blasted toward the three armored figures, but they were all blocked.</p><p>The three armored figures were sent flying, but Lu Ming’s finger force was also blocked.</p><p>“Five-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the buzz-cut young man’s cultivation was at the five-star illusionary Emperor stage and he had mastered three types of laws. This was because the dead spirits he summoned not only contained the death law but also other laws.</p><p>The stronger the summoner’s cultivation, the more powerful the undead spirit would be. Furthermore, the more nomological laws it contained, the stronger it would be.</p><p>Therefore, the combat strength of these three undead spirits was very shocking.</p><p>However, it was not over yet. The short-haired young man did not stop summoning. There were shadows flashing in the space. In the end, there were nine armored figures that charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming is going to lose!”</p><p>LAN Yun sneered.</p><p>The short-haired young man could continuously summon dead spirits in an endless stream. He could exhaust Lu Ming to death.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming was defeated, he would be stripped of the indestructible ancient scroll. At that time, his soul would be injured and he would be reduced to an idiot or even die.</p><p>Thinking of this, he felt very comfortable.</p><p>he wants to challenge all the heaven’s favorites with such strength? he is overestimating himself!</p><p>Yan Xi also said coldly.</p><p>At this moment, the nine armored figures had already reached Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out nine palms in a row, resisting the nine iron-armored figures. His body was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>The short-haired young man revealed an excited expression.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength? Then we can end this!”</p><p>let’s go,” Lu Ming said calmly. A giant hammer appeared in his hand.</p><p>The chaos hammer!</p><p>This hammer of chaos contained six types of laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
