Someone recognized that this was a heavenly Emperor realm expert.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet stopped and asked.</p><p>“May 1 ask if the indestructible ancient scroll has appeared?”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor asked.</p><p>“The indestructible ancient scroll has already found its successor!”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet left these words and then took a step forward, disappearing from Mount eternal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the huge Mount eternal started to shake and exude a terrifying pressure. The void shattered, revealing the endless dark void.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The majestic Mount eternal rumbled and began to move. It flew into the endless dark void and disappeared. Then, the cracked space healed and returned to its original state.</p><p>Mount eternal had disappeared. He would sink into the dark void forever!</p><p>But at this moment, no one had the time to lament the disappearance of Mount eternal. Their attention was focused on the middle-aged puppet’s words.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll had already found its successor!</p><p>This meant that the indestructible ancient scroll had already been obtained by someone else. And it was among these thousands of heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the thousands of Young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>This included the heavenly Emperor powerhouses.</p><p>The thousands of Young heaven’s favorites were all sizing each other up.</p><p>In the end, more than ten young men’s gazes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>These heaven’s favorites had all passed the first test in Mount eternal. However, they had all failed the second test.</p><p>They all saw that Lu Ming had passed the second round of assessment and continued to move forward.</p><p>If anyone had obtained the indestructible ancient scroll, it would definitely be Lu Ming.</p><p>Some people’s eyes were filled with jealousy.</p><p>“Who among you has obtained the indestructible ancient scroll? step forward!”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor expert spoke. A wisp of aura emanated from his body, as if it was the heavenly Dao. It represented this world, and it made one’s heart tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned but did not say anything.</p><p>“Who is it? come out!”</p><p>Another celestial Thearch stepped out. His eyes were like two stars, shining with a brilliant light as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lord heavenly Emperor, I know who has obtained the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man spoke. Lu Ming had forgotten his past. It was a young man with short hair.</p><p>“Oh? Who is it?”</p><p>One of the heavenly emperors asked.</p><p>“It’s him, Lu Ming!”</p><p>The short-haired youth pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? It’s actually him!”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Many people did not believe it.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming not a Saint Emperor yet? how did he manage to obtain the indestructible ancient scroll? what was going on?</p><p>“It’s indeed him. Among all of us, he was the only one who made it to the end. If there’s anyone who has obtained the indestructible ancient scroll, it has to be him!”</p><p>Another young man said.</p><p>Following that, a few other young men pointed out that Lu Ming had obtained the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>“He actually got it, damn it!”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others from the Heng Xing River were all filled with jealousy.</p><p>At the scene, almost everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you get the indestructible ancient scroll? Tell me the truth, it’s best not to lie!”</p><p>One of the heavenly emperors looked at Lu Ming and said in a cold and aloof voice.</p><p>“It’s the LAN family’s heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Someone whispered nearby. Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>It seemed that this heavenly Emperor came from LAN Yun’s clan.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m the one who obtained the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned but eventually admitted it.</p><p>After all, so many people had seen him pass the second stage, and he was the only one who had made it to the end. As long as one wasn’t an idiot, they would know that the indestructible ancient scroll had definitely been obtained by him. There was no use in denying it, so it was better to admit it directly.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch and the other celestial thearchs ‘eyes lit up with a burning flame.</p><p>“Now, hand over the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch said. His eyes were burning with passion as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Normally, it would be very difficult for a heavenly Emperor realm powerhouse to have such a fluctuation in his heart. However, the indestructible ancient scroll’s temptation was too strong. It was an ancient scroll that shook the heaven realm, and it was the most powerful life-saving ancient scroll. Even a heavenly Emperor would be tempted by it.</p><p>“That’s right, hurry up and take it out!”</p><p>The other Celestial Emperor also spoke coldly.</p><p>They had a haughty look on their faces and their tone was cold and overbearing. They demanded Lu Ming to hand over the ancient scripture in an aggressive manner.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had no choice but to do as they said.</p><p>“What kind of attitude is this?”</p><p>Dandan was unhappy and shouted,” this is the opportunity that Lu Ming obtained. It is his personal opportunity. He can pass it to whoever he wants? ”</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor glanced at dandan coldly and said,” what a joke! The indestructible ancient scroll is a treasure of the heaven realm. How can he swallow it all by himself? hand it over and everyone’s combat power will be improved. This is beneficial to the entire heaven realm!</p><p>“So what if this is the case? After all, this was what Lu Ming had obtained through his own hard work. It belonged to him. Was this the attitude they had when they asked others to take out their own treasures? Why are you acting so overbearing? can’t you just ask for a favor?”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“How dare you? what kind of person is the heavenly Emperor? He was just asking him to take out an ancient scripture, why did he need to invite him? Can he bear the responsibility?”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, there’s nothing amazing about being a Celestial Emperor!”</p><p>Dandan pouted.</p><p>how dare you insult the celestial Emperor! This is a capital crime!</p><p>LAN Yun roared in anger.</p><p>But dandan pouted and ignored him.</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor and the other heavenly emperors cast a few cold glances at dandan. With their eyesight, they could naturally see dandan’s true form. They did not say anything and continued to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hand over the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch spoke with an air of superiority as if it was only natural for him to ask Lu Ming to hand it over.</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth in anger.</p><p>seniors, if 1 could hand it over, I would definitely do so. Unfortunately, I can’t!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>Although he was furious, he understood that he could only compromise when facing a heavenly Emperor expert. There was no way to resist because the difference in power was too great. He could be crushed into pieces with just a breath from the other party.</p><p>Even if he had a Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body, it would be useless.</p><p>“You can’t hand it over? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor and the other heavenly emperors ‘eyes glinted coldly.</p><p>that’s because when the undying Emperor was besieged by the alien races, his soul was destroyed and he didn’t leave behind any secret manual that recorded the undying ancient scroll. He only used a heavenly Dao imprint to carry the undying ancient scroll back to Mount eternal!</p><p>what I obtained was the heaven Dao imprint of the undying heavenly Emperor. However, the heaven Dao imprint is too mysterious. With my current cultivation, I can’t inscribe the undying ancient scroll. Therefore, I can’t hand it over!</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>nonsense! He’s just spouting nonsense!</p><p>Yan Xi called out.</p><p>“That’s right. He doesn’t want to hand over the indestructible ancient scroll and wants to keep it for himself. That’s why he came up with such a ridiculous excuse. He’s too selfish!”</p><p>LAN Yun followed suit.</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch and the rest looked at Lu Ming with deep doubts. They obviously did not believe him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
