A terrifying force came pressing down on him, sending him flying and coughing up blood.</p><p>At the same time, the thin and small evil god race member attacked again and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>B0x𝔫𝙤ѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>Lu Ming roared and dodged with all his might. At the same time, he activated the inextinguishable golden body and his body became as hard as a divine weapon.</p><p>However, the other party’s sharp blade slashed at Lu Ming’s body and the inextinguishable golden body was still broken. A few deep wounds appeared and touched the bone armor.</p><p>If he didn’t have the imperishable golden body, his body would have been cut in half.</p><p>“Damn it, why is this brat so hard to kill? kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The thin and small evil god continued to roar. His four arms and four sharp blades kept swinging out, launching a storm of attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other member of the evil god tribe charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them attacked and Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength, constantly dodging and occasionally retaliating. However, he was still constantly injured. There were a few times when he was almost beheaded.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the indestructible ancient scroll, which allowed his injuries to recover quickly. If it had been anyone else, they would have died long ago.</p><p>However, he couldn’t continue like this. He was still no match for the other party and would be killed by him long ago.</p><p>One of the opponents was powerful while the other was astonishingly fast. Both of them were more powerful than Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming began to consider if he should use the fallen star bow.</p><p>Right at this moment, not far away, a streak of rainbow light whizzed over. Its speed was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Human!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that it was a white-haired old man, who was charging straight towards their battlefield.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>From a distance, the old man slashed out a sword light toward that thin and small evil god race member.</p><p>That thin and small evil god race member brandished his four sharp blades to block, clashing with the sword light.</p><p>With a few explosions, the body of the small evil god race member trembled violently and was sent flying.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired old man had already arrived. He held a longsword in his hand, and an ice-cold sword light burst forth, pouring down toward the thin and small evil god race member.</p><p>This old man’s strength was shocking, and it was even above that of the small evil god race member. Instantly, the small evil god race member was unable to retaliate and could only defend.</p><p>With only the burly evil god left, Lu Ming’s pressure was greatly reduced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his infinite Dragon Spear and charged toward the burly evil god.</p><p>Although he was no match for the burly evil god tribe, Lu Ming did not care about his own defense at all and launched a frenzied attack.</p><p>Even if the other party’s attack landed on Lu Ming, as long as it was not an instant kill, Lu Ming was not afraid.</p><p>In the beginning of the fierce battle between the two, Lu Ming was still at a disadvantage. However, as time passed, he began to turn the tables.</p><p>He didn’t care about defense. Even if he was injured, he could recover quickly. However, the other party couldn’t do it. He had to divert his attention to defense. After a long battle, his energy consumption was very heavy.</p><p>Slowly, Lu Ming actually gained the upper hand and was suppressed instead.</p><p>“Continue, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes became extremely bright.</p><p>In a life-and-death battle, one’s potential could be stimulated the most, and one’s comprehension of nomological laws was the deepest.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt that his comprehension of the array Dao law and the death law had reached a limit. He was about to touch the window to a breakthrough.</p><p>He was so close. As long as he could break through the paper window, Lu Ming would be able to break through.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>At this time, a scream was heard.</p><p>that small evil god race member was no match for the white-haired old man and was killed by him with a sword.</p><p>The skinny evil god was killed, and the muscular evil god was shocked. He was in a state of confusion as he was stabbed by Lu Ming’s spear, and a hole appeared on his body.</p><p>the evil god race member didn’t care about his injuries and turned around to run.</p><p>He knew that he was no match for them. If he didn’t run, he would die.</p><p>He ran in the other direction of the white-haired old man. He was running at an amazing speed.</p><p>“You want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. The fallen star bow appeared. He pulled the bowstring and a nine-colored arrow flew out.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the power of the fallen star bow was even more shocking.</p><p>The arrow flew through the air. The muscular evil god race member wanted to block it, but he was heavily injured and could not block it at all. His head was shot through, and his brain exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>Two members of the evil god race had fallen!</p><p>“Haha, amazing, amazing, truly amazing!”</p><p>The white-haired elder laughed and looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the five-star illusionary Emperor stage, but his combat strength was shockingly powerful, which shocked him greatly.</p><p>“Thank you for your help, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>“Haha, you don’t have to thank me. With your strength, even if I didn’t do anything, you would be fine. You’re only a five-star void Emperor, but you’re actually able to fight against a fifth stage true Emperor. This really surprised me!”</p><p>“Fifth stage true Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look.</p><p>“Little brother, you don’t know how true emperors are ranked?”</p><p>The white-haired old man was surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He really did not know.</p><p>you don’t know the true Emperor’s combat strength and you dare to come to the battlefield of true emperors. This …</p><p>The white-haired old man was speechless. He continued, little brother, let’s take the crystal core first and then leave this place. I’m afraid that the battle just now will attract others!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the burly evil god and put away his storage bracelet and crystal core.</p><p>The white-haired old man then kept the evil god race’s storage bracelet and crystal core.</p><p>Then, the two of them left the place. Not long after, they appeared in a hidden cave.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming found out that the old man’s name was Bai tai. Lu Ming also told him his name.</p><p>However, the old man had never heard of Lu Ming’s name. This was because he had been killing alien races on the battlefield and had not gone out.</p><p>“Senior white, I wonder how the true Emperor realm’s battle strength is divided?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>Previously, he had heard Bai tai say that he had the battle power of a stage five true Emperor and not a few star true Emperor. He was very curious.</p><p>the true Emperor realm is a very complicated realm. In terms of cultivation, it’s usually one to seven stars. However, there’s a huge difference in battle strength, and that’s because of the laws!</p><p>in the true Emperor realm, laws determine one’s combat power. Cultivation isn’t that important. For example, a seven-star true Emperor only has three to four types of second realm laws, while a one-star true Emperor has nine types of Third Realm laws. So, who do you think is stronger? ”</p><p>Bai tai explained and then asked.</p><p>naturally, the one who controls nine types of third level laws is stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. That’s why in the true Emperor realm, although cultivation can also determine one’s combat power, it’s not that important. Nomological laws have a greater influence on combat power!</p><p>“However, the gap in the laws of the true Emperor realm is too big!”</p><p>as everyone knows, as long as one’s cultivation reaches the peak of the void Emperor realm and has cultivated three types of nomological laws to the second realm, one can break through to the true Emperor realm and become a one-star true Emperor. However, this is the weakest one-star true Emperor, who is only at the second realm of three types of nomological laws!</p><p>if you want to become a great emperor, you have to cultivate the nine types of laws to the third realm. Some peak true Emperor laws can control nine types of Third Realm laws!</p><p>“Three types of second level, nine types of third level, and each level has a different level of maturity. What’s the difference between them?”</p><p>Bai tai explained in detail..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
