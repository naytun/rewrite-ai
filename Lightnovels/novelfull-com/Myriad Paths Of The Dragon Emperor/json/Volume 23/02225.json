He was the most dazzling star in the heaven realm during that era.</p><p>However, Gu Lingtian’s heart was higher than the sky. He wanted to walk a different path, a path that no one had ever walked before, or a path that no one had ever walked.</p><p>Before he had become a monarch, he had actually relied on his terrifying talent to cultivate several types of laws. He wanted to use the many types of laws to create a small world when he became a monarch.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not walk this path in the end. He was blocked, and this block would last a lifetime.</p><p>Gu Lingtian had spent his entire life researching, and he had finally found a way in his later years.</p><p>To be able to control so many laws before becoming a monarch, one had to pay attention to balance.</p><p>This was because it was too difficult to condense the world core with many types of laws when one became a great emperor. The laws would collide with each other and burst out with terrifying forces that would tear the Saint heart and the body.</p><p>That was why it was difficult to become an Emperor.</p><p>However, as long as the many laws reached a balance, there would be no tearing force, and one could successfully evolve the Saint heart and become an Emperor.</p><p>However, it was very difficult to achieve a balance among the many laws.</p><p>On this issue, he wasn’t the Son of God and had an advantage.</p><p>Since he was the Son of God and had mastered one ultimate law, it would be difficult to achieve a balance if he mastered other laws.</p><p>According to Gu Lingtian’s speculations, a King body that could control three, six, or nine King path laws would be able to reach a balance and become a monarch.</p><p>However, in history, those who had the ability and talent to control multiple laws before becoming a saint Emperor were all children of God who controlled the strongest laws.</p><p>No matter how he matched it, it would be difficult to achieve a balance between the many laws.</p><p>This was because an ultimate Maxim was too powerful, and it was difficult for other maxims to maintain a balance with an ultimate Maxim.</p><p>Gu Lingtian speculated that if a person could control three Supreme laws and six King path laws, they would be able to maintain a balance and successfully develop the world core.</p><p>Or, a person who could control six or nine ultimate maxims could also develop the world core.</p><p>three types of ultimate laws and six types of King path laws. I can definitely do it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were exceptionally bright and his heart was overwhelmed with ecstasy.</p><p>He had already mastered two ultimate laws and five King path laws. He could completely comprehend another ultimate law and King path law.</p><p>Gu Lingtian had also mentioned that these laws had to be at the same level to maintain balance.</p><p>For example, if one of the laws had reached the second realm and the rest were at the first realm, that would not work.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly glad that he had not reached the second realm of his laws.</p><p>As long as he cultivated all these laws to the first realm perfection, he would be able to vindicate his Dao and become a monarch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words made dandan and Mu Lan overjoyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, quick, let me take a look!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming passed the Jade card to dandan and she immediately looked at it.</p><p>After reading it, dandan fell silent and passed the Jade token to Gu Xinghui. After that, Mu Lan also took it and looked at it.</p><p>it’s a pity. Gu Lingtian is indeed a genius. He mastered an ultimate law and eight King path laws, but he couldn’t reach a balance and become a Monarch!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>Gu Xinghui’s eyes were filled with sadness.</p><p>the method recorded by my father seems simple, but it’s actually extremely difficult to achieve it. Before becoming a sovereign, it’s impossible for ordinary people to master multiple nomological laws. Only the child of God has the talent to do so!</p><p>however, it’s impossible for one person to master more than two ultimate maxims at the same time. Therefore, almost no one can achieve such conditions. In my opinion, the method that father developed is completely tailor-made for brother Lu Ming!</p><p>Gu Xinghui sighed.</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right!”</p><p>Dandan also sighed.</p><p>Mu Lan was also happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I hope that you can vindicate your Dao and become a saint Emperor. This way, you will have fulfilled my father’s last wish!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely determined.</p><p>how about this? I’ll take you to a place that will help you comprehend many laws. It will help you become a divine Emperor earlier!</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>After that, Gu Xinghui stepped into the air and left. Lu Ming, dandan, and Mu Lan followed him.</p><p>They headed towards the depths of the purple bamboo forest. Not long after, they arrived in front of a huge ancient tree.</p><p>This ancient tree was hundreds of meters tall and was as thick as a dozen people hugging it.</p><p>Gu Xinghui waved his hand, and a light door appeared on the ancient tree.</p><p>“So, there’s a small world hidden here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was obvious that the door of light on the ancient tree was the entrance to the small world.</p><p>Gu Xinghui entered the door of light. Lu Ming and the rest also entered one by one.</p><p>As soon as he entered the door of light, he arrived in another world.</p><p>the laws here are so clear. 1 feel refreshed and my heart is empty!</p><p>As soon as they entered the small world, Lu Ming and the rest felt that something was amiss.</p><p>This was especially true for Lu Ming. He felt as if he was cultivating under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui smiled and left.</p><p>After flying for a long distance, they came to a mountain range.</p><p>However, this mountain range was barren. There was no vegetation at all, only a giant tree in the middle of the mountain range.</p><p>“That is … The path-understanding ancient tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded at the sight of the huge tree.</p><p>Yes, there was indeed a path-understanding ancient tree here. Although the species was different from the one that Lu Ming had, it was indeed the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>This path-understanding ancient tree could not be compared to the one Lu Ming had.</p><p>Lu Ming’s one had already taken root on one of the mountain peaks in the mountain and river diagram. It was more than thirty meters tail.</p><p>However, the one in front of him was at least a thousand meters tall.</p><p>The ancient tree towered into the sky, and its branches were surrounded by the great Dao. Everyone felt their hearts become empty, and their minds became incomparably clear.</p><p>It was many times more effective than the one that Lu Ming had.</p><p>good, your Gu family actually secretly cultivated a path-understanding ancient tree. Amazing!</p><p>Dandan grinned and sighed, her eyes shining.</p><p>“It’s a pity that it hasn’t fully matured even after countless years of cultivation!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui sighed.</p><p>it’s already not bad that it could grow to a thousand meters tall. I had one back then, but it was destroyed in the great battle before it matured!</p><p>He cast a glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His path-understanding ancient tree was cultivated from a withered branch. That withered branch appeared together with dandan back then and they obtained it together. Could it be that it was dandan’s?</p><p>This was very possible!</p><p>“You can cultivate here from now on!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>haha, good, good. Lu Ming, this is the most suitable place for you at your current stage!</p><p>Dandan said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed.</p><p>His main focus now was to comprehend the laws, so this place was indeed very suitable for him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
