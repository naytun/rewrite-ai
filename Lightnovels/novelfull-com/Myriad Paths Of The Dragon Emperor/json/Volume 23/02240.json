But now, the ancient path continued on. This meant that he had succeeded.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you’ve succeeded, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out in excitement.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across and realized that there was no platform in front of bubbles and the stunning woman. The platform had disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, a shocking aura came from other directions. Lu Ming swept his gaze around and found that it was the young geniuses from the other eight Roads. These people were looking at Lu Ming’s side with fiery eyes.</p><p>The platforms in front of them had disappeared. Only a platform remained in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Bubble, what happened? Did you all fail?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. The others all failed half a month ago. Once they failed, the platform disappeared. You’re the only one who has persisted until now!</p><p>Bubbles explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that he was the only one who had succeeded.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>Bubbles and the beautiful lady followed suit.</p><p>However, when bubbles and the stunning lady stepped onto the new ancient path, they were blocked by an invisible force and could not take a single step.</p><p>However, it had no effect on him.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, the bubbles can’t go up. Chirp chirp!</p><p>Paopao pouted, extremely unhappy.</p><p>“I’ll help you!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked back and wanted to pull bubbles up with him. However, he realized that he could not even go up.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you can go up alone!”</p><p>Pao Pao said.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming had no choice but to give up and head towards the ancient road alone.</p><p>The gazes of the youths on the other eight paths all fell on Lu Ming. Some sighed, some were envious, and some were jealous.</p><p>Lu Ming moved forward and slowly disappeared from everyone’s sight, my physical body and Saint power have improved again!</p><p>As he walked, Lu Ming could feel the changes in his body.</p><p>Previously, when the life law reached the completion of the first level, it tempered the body and Saint power. This was an ultimate law, and its effect on the tempering of the body and Saint power was very amazing.</p><p>His body became stronger, and his Saint power became more condensed.</p><p>In terms of quality, Lu Ming’s current Holy energy was not inferior to the world Energy at all. In fact, it was even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had undoubtedly increased.</p><p>There was nothing unusual for the rest of the journey. It was very calm. Lu Ming quickened his pace and soon, he reached the end of the road.</p><p>In front of them was a huge and magnificent Palace.</p><p>In front of the palace was a white jade square.</p><p>In the sky above the White jade square, there was a ball of light that was extremely bright.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was attracted by the ball of light. He squinted and realized that the core of the light was a small piece of glass-like shard that was crystal clear and bright.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stepped into the White jade square, the ball of light charged at him at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He instinctively wanted to Dodge, but it was too late. The ball of light flew directly into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows and disappeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, there was an additional fragment in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“This is … The indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>This was because as long as his soul power got close to this fragment, he would be able to sense some information.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the fragment actually exploded and turned into waves of energy. It combined with Lu Ming’s soul and became one. Then, a piece of information surged into Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“It really is the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if the indestructible ancient scroll had become one with him. As long as he willed it, the indestructible ancient scroll would appear in his mind and he would be able to comprehend it.</p><p>This was very different from what Lu Ming had expected.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had thought that the indestructible ancient scripture was a Scripture or stored in a jade talisman. He did not expect that it would enter his mind in such a form.</p><p>“Can I inscribe the indestructible ancient scroll?”</p><p>At the thought of this, a jade talisman appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He wanted to engrave the cultivation method of the indestructible ancient scroll into the Jade talisman.</p><p>However, when he wanted to inscribe it, he was at a loss. He didn’t know where to start. He had no idea where to start.</p><p>He only needed to think about it, and the cultivation method of the indestructible ancient scroll would appear in his mind. However, when he wanted to inscribe it, he couldn’t grasp the divine rhythm. It felt high and mighty, and he didn’t know where to start.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was the figure that looked exactly like the middle-aged puppet.</p><p>“Don’t even think about inscribing it, your cultivation is too low, you can’t do it at all!”</p><p>The middle-aged man spoke.</p><p>“Senior, what’s going on? Why is it an imprint?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Sigh, it’s already not bad to be able to retain one imprint!”</p><p>back then, master was besieged by the foreign races. He died, and his Dao dissipated. His soul scattered. In the end, master was unwilling to let the indestructible ancient scroll be buried just like that. He used his last resort to get a heavenly Dao imprint to bring the indestructible ancient scroll back. At the same time, he gave me some instructions. After that, he lost his last consciousness, and only the indestructible ancient scroll remained!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. At the same time, he felt a sense of sadness.</p><p>Even an invincible figure like the undying venerable sovereign had fallen, leaving behind only a mark of the great path.</p><p>He had no choice but to do this. If such a thing had not happened, the undying venerable sovereign could have left behind a Scripture or a jade talisman, which would have been a better inheritance.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also understood why he could not inscribe the ancient indestructible scroll.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll was contained in the heavenly Dao imprint of the indestructible venerable Emperor. The heavenly Emperor powerhouses had merged with the heavenly Dao. To Lu Ming, this was too far away. It was beyond mysterious.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming could not grasp it and could not inscribe it.</p><p>Only when Lu Ming’s cultivation level was strong enough in the future would he be able to inscribe the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>“Alright, you have obtained the indestructible ancient scroll, and 1 have completed my mission. Now, I will send you out!”</p><p>With that, the middle-aged man waved his hand. Lu Ming immediately felt a powerful force enveloping him. The next moment, there was a fluctuation in the void. Lu Ming disappeared and reappeared outside mount eternal, outside the door of light.</p><p>At the same time, the young men in Mount eternal also disappeared and reappeared outside.</p><p>it’s out. This time, it’s been three months!</p><p>“I wonder if anyone has obtained the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they looked at the thousands of Young heaven’s favorites who entered.</p><p>alright, my mission has been completed. From now on, following the venerable sovereign’s last will, Mount eternal shall sink into the endless void forever!</p><p>On Mount eternal, the middle-aged puppet spoke, then turned around to leave. “Daoist brother, please wait!”</p><p>At this moment, someone called out to the middle-aged puppet..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
