But I’m not using world force. I’m just sparring with you using laws of nature. Why are you still afraid? ”</p><p>Dandan grinned and gave Lu Ming a sidelong glance.</p><p>Lu Ming was unhappy, so be it. Let’s go. We’ll spar further away!</p><p>After the few of them flew for a distance, they began to fight.</p><p>Dandan did not use her cultivation to suppress Lu Ming. She only used a little world Energy to activate the law and fought with Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming was defeated by dandan in one move.</p><p>This made Lu Ming speechless. Was there such a huge difference?</p><p>Although dandan had also controlled nine types of nomological laws, he had also controlled nine types of nomological laws. However, after colliding with dandan’s nomological laws, his nomological laws were completely vulnerable.</p><p>“Lu Ming, although you’ve mastered many laws, it’s only the crudest fusion. You don’t have an ancient scripture that can unleash the full power of these laws, so the power is too weak!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“It’s a pity that there are no ancient scriptures!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was also bitter.</p><p>Although he had created the hammer of chaos and the sword of death, he had only created them not long ago and was far from completion. Their power was also limited.</p><p>those ancient Sutras were created by others. Those who created them also created them according to the laws they controlled. Right now, you’re just inexperienced, so you can’t fully exert the divine power you created!</p><p>if you can fully unleash the nomological laws you’ve mastered, its power will definitely be stronger than many ancient scriptures. After all, you created it yourself!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“Dandan, you have so much experience, why don’t you teach me!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile and looked at dandan.</p><p>haha, now you know how powerful I am. Don’t worry, I’m here to spar with you because I want to give you some pointers. Come on, use your full strength!</p><p>Dandan laughed out loud and was very proud. With one hand behind her back, she had the demeanor of a peerless expert.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not expose him. After all, he had a request to make.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed. The hammer of chaos condensed in his palm and he struck at dandan.</p><p>At least five types of nomological laws burst out at the same time, forming a finger force that struck the hammer of chaos. The hammer of chaos shook violently and finally exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hammer of chaos also contained five types of laws, but it was as easy as tofu. On the other hand, dan Dan’s five types of laws were like steel, crushing Lu Ming’s hammer of chaos in an instant.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming then rushed toward dandan and resisted with the law.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was completely defeated every time.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming was exhausted and he finally stopped.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had gained a lot from this battle. He was more adept at the use of laws. When he used the hammer of chaos or the sword of death, the various laws complemented each other and the explosive power increased slightly.</p><p>Dandan, although she bragged every day and was sometimes unreliable, her experience was really there.</p><p>Moreover, the divine turtle of the world was also known as the world. It was born with unparalleled control over the laws and was stronger than the other top ten beasts. Therefore, it could often point out the flaws in Lu Ming’s use of the laws and allowed Lu Ming to improve rapidly.</p><p>go back and digest this. We’ll continue the competition in seven days!</p><p>Dandan grinned and walked towards the path of enlightenment.</p><p>They returned to the path-understanding ancient tree and continued cultivating.</p><p>Previously, Mu Lan had been watching Lu Ming and dandan fight. She had learned a lot and needed to digest it.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming had one more thing to do, which was to fight with dandan.</p><p>Every seven days, he would fight with dandan once. His comprehension of various laws and the use of laws had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>His mastery of the four laws-the law of alchemy, the law of craftsmanship, the law of penetration, and the law of life-increased very quickly. After all, he was under the Enlightenment ancient tree. Coupled with Lu Ming’s own talent, it would be difficult for him not to improve.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s two self-created divine abilities, the hammer of chaos and the sword of death, were getting more and more powerful.</p><p>It was not only the original nomological laws, but also the penetration law.</p><p>One divine power contained seven types of laws, and its power kept increasing.</p><p>Finally, after cultivating here for a year, Lu Ming had reached perfection in another law.</p><p>The laws of alchemy!</p><p>The law of alchemy had reached perfection and the law had formed a River. Lu Ming’s physical body and Saint energy had been tempered again and had improved greatly.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming’s combat strength was also increasing rapidly.</p><p>After cultivating here for a year and a half, Lu Ming’s equipment Dao laws had also reached perfection.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming was still left with the penetration law and the life law. He had not reached the completion of the first level.</p><p>The life law was an ultimate law, and its speed of improvement was much slower.</p><p>On a flat land far away from the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming and dandan continued to fight.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s strength had increased rapidly, dandan’s improvement was even faster. Lu Ming felt that the nine types of laws that dandan controlled had most likely reached the second realm.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was completely outmatched.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and Lu Ming retreated.</p><p>unfortunately, my ultimate Maxim can’t be fused together!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Whether it was the hammer of chaos or the sword of death, both only contained one ultimate law. If he could fuse other ultimate laws into them, his power would probably increase dramatically.</p><p>However, if the ultimate laws did not merge, it would be too difficult to fuse them.</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>it’s impossible,” dandan said, it’s said that one person can’t control two ultimate maxims, but didn’t you do it? ” Since you can control so many ultimate maxims, you can naturally merge them into one divine power!”</p><p>Speaking of which, Lu Ming, your path is completely different from others. If you cultivate the ancient scriptures created by others, you won’t be able to unleash your full potential. Other people’s ancient scriptures all use a single ultimate Maxim as the core, but you’ve mastered multiple ultimate maxims. If you want to unleash your full potential, you’ll have to create it yourself!</p><p>It was rare for dandan to be serious and give Lu Ming serious guidance.</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly touched!</p><p>That was indeed the case. None of the peerless talents who had created various ancient scriptures had mastered multiple ultimate laws. Most of them had mastered one ultimate law and then combined it with other King path laws and ordinary laws to create it.</p><p>None of them were suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to tap into all his potential, he had to create his own ancient scriptures and divine powers.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt enlightened. He felt that he could see his future path.</p><p>“Dandan, many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming thanked dandan very seriously.</p><p>hahaha, Who am 1? I’m the leader of the top ten Battle Beasts, an invincible peerless genius. Do You Believe Me Now? ”</p><p>Dandan grinned and laughed, feeling extremely comfortable and happy.</p><p>come, continue. Let me guide you so that you can fuse the strongest laws as soon as possible!</p><p>Dandan shouted, full of energy.</p><p>Although dandan had not mastered many ultimate maxims, her experience was very helpful to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was too difficult to merge different ultimate maxims into one sacred art.</p><p>Lu Ming had tried many times but he still failed. However, they did not give up and had been studying it..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
