However, the power of the lightning became even more terrifying.</p><p>The atmosphere between heaven and earth became more and more oppressive.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air, circulating the life law with all his might to recover from his injuries and raise his condition to the maximum.</p><p>He had a feeling that the ninth lightning tribulation would be extremely terrifying. If he was not careful, he would be in danger of dying.</p><p>“Look, what’s that on the Tribulation cloud?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>There was no need for anyone to call out, everyone else had seen it.</p><p>A Palace actually appeared in the Tribulation cloud.</p><p>A huge Palace appeared from the Tribulation cloud. It was also formed by the power of Thunder.</p><p>There seemed to be a square in front of the palace. However, the entire Palace and square were indistinct in the Tribulation clouds and could not be seen clearly.</p><p>“Ta!”…</p><p>At this moment, footsteps were heard in front of the palace.</p><p>Yes, it was the sound of footsteps.</p><p>Even in the midst of the rumbling Thunder, the footsteps were very clear.</p><p>Then, a burly figure appeared in front of the palace.</p><p>It was a burly middle-aged man in purple-gold armor. He held a purple-gold spear in his hand and exuded a shocking aura.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded, including those at the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>A Palace had appeared in the ninth Heavenly Tribulation, and a figure had actually walked out of the palace. This was simply unheard of.</p><p>no, this figure isn’t a physical body either. It’s also formed by the lightning tribulation!</p><p>Someone said. He could tell.</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief. It was easier to accept if it was formed by lightning. If it was a real person, it would be really hard to accept.</p><p>Facing this figure, Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and his gaze was extremely solemn.</p><p>Facing this figure, he felt a fatal danger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The figure suddenly roared and leaped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was so fast that it was like a purple-gold ray of light that shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An extremely sharp spear gleam was aimed at the area between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his six-feathered divine wings and dodged the attack at an extremely fast speed. However, his opponent’s spear swept across the air and caused the void to explode. It was going to blow Lu Ming up.</p><p>A long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hands. He fused eight types of laws and swept out with the spear.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he retreated continuously. He could only feel a sharp pain in his arm.</p><p>However, the other party had also been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had gone through eight major tribulations in a row. His strength was getting stronger and stronger in the process of transcending the tribulations. He was much stronger than before he had transcended the tribulations. However, he was still sent flying by one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other party roared and charged at Lu Ming again. He was not afraid of death. He only had one goal-to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battle between the two was extremely intense. In the blink of an eye, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>However, at this moment, in the Tribulation clouds, in front of the palace, footsteps sounded again, and another burly man in purple-gold armor appeared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man in purple gold armor who appeared behind him shouted as well. He was filled with cold killing intent as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The two burly men in purple-gold armor joined forces to attack Lu Ming. Each of them was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He used his six-feathered divine wings in an attempt to Dodge, but he was still swept by the spear. A wound appeared, and his flesh and blood were separated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two burly men in purple gold armor had similar combat strength. They surrounded Lu Ming from two directions.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to resist but he was no match for them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was hit by the Spear’s gleam and his body flew out like a cannonball. He was almost split into two.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that his physical body was extremely strong, he would not have been able to block it.</p><p>Lu Ming coughed up a large mouthful of blood and circulated the life law with all his might to heal his injuries.</p><p>However, the two burly men in purple-gold armor charged over again.</p><p>Lu Ming could only fight!</p><p>In such a situation, only by fighting to the death could they survive. Otherwise, only death would await them.</p><p>This was a tough battle. Lu Ming was severely injured one after another. If not for the life law, he would not have been able to withstand it.</p><p>However, one of the burly men in purple-gold armor was not in a good state either. After being hit by Lu Ming twice, his armor was penetrated and two holes appeared on his body. Lightning flashed continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to exchange injury for injury, using the profound mysteries of the life law to drag the other party to death.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan and the others were extremely worried.</p><p>LAN Yun and the rest were nervous and looking forward to it. They hoped that Lu Ming would be killed.</p><p>However, at this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the palace on the Tribulation cloud. Another burly man in purple-gold armor appeared.</p><p>The third one!</p><p>“Why is there more?”</p><p>Mu Lan cried out, extremely worried.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles ‘eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>The Gu family, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor, and the others were also extremely worried.</p><p>Lu Ming was no match for the two burly men in purple gold armor. How could he fight against three of them?</p><p>There was no way out, only death.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch and the others were overjoyed and sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The third burly man in purple gold armor also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to Dodge, but the three burly men in purple-gold armor were not weaker than him at his peak. Now that the three of them were surrounding him, he could not resist at all. The long spear swept across his shoulder and half of his body exploded. One of his arms was also turned into dust.</p><p>“Recover!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the life law and enveloped his entire body. His muscles were wriggling rapidly, trying to recover.</p><p>However, the three burly men in purple-gold armor would not give him the chance to do so. They charged at him again.</p><p>Lu Ming could only Dodge with all his might.</p><p>It was a pity that he was still not prepared. If he had spent some time cultivating the indestructible ancient scroll, he would definitely not have been so passive.</p><p>The recovery rate of the indestructible ancient scroll was much, much stronger than the recovery rate of the life law alone. He would probably be able to recover from such injuries very quickly. At the same time, his defense would be much stronger after cultivating the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>The hasty breakthrough had put Lu Ming in a fatal crisis.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was hit again, and his body was sent flying. His body was pierced, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“He’s going to die!”</p><p>it’s over. Lu Ming can’t survive the major tribulation!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming had shocked both the past and the present. He had not become a great emperor but he controlled many types of laws, including three ultimate laws. Such a person could not have become a great emperor. However, Lu Ming had broken the truth and created a miracle.</p><p>He had actually attracted a Heavenly Tribulation. As long as he could pass the heavenly Tribulation, he would become a monarch.</p><p>He had already passed through the eighth Heavenly Tribulation. Could it be that he was going to fall in the end?</p><p>Many people sighed for Lu Ming.</p><p>Only a few of them sneered, hoping that Lu Ming would die from the lightning tribulation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, merge the life law into it!”</p><p>Dandan roared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>However, it was too late. A long spear was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a sure-kill spear. If he was stabbed, his soul would be destroyed and Lu Ming would die without a doubt..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
