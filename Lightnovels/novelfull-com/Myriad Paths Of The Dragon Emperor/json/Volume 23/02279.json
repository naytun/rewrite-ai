Living beings could enter and live in the small world, and they could even cultivate inside.</p><p>Naturally, the amount of energy required was also very shocking.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s speed of refining the chaos Qi was much faster than before. He could refine a chaos stone in three days, which was three wisps of chaos Qi.</p><p>After refining one piece, Lu Ming took out another piece.</p><p>Very quickly, a month had passed. Lu Ming had refined ten chaos gems but he had not broken through.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’S speed of refining the chaos gems was getting faster and faster.</p><p>In three months, he had refined more than thirty pieces.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>At this moment; Lu Ming’s accumulation had reached its peak. His small world rumbled and expanded continuously.</p><p>In the end, the area of Lu Ming s small world had reached a radius of one hundred thousand miles. This area was almost the same as the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Evolution!”</p><p>With a single thought, mountains, rivers, and lakes appeared in the small world.</p><p>However, there were no signs of life.</p><p>If one wanted to create a living being, they had to at least reach the great emperor realm and control the great Dao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a layer of light emanated from Lu Ming’s body. It was the world’s divine light.</p><p>The world God light meant that the small world was completely stable and he had stepped into the true Emperor realm.</p><p>“I’ve finally broken through to the true Emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He could feel that his World Energy was five to six times stronger than before. It was extremely robust.</p><p>After refining more than thirty chaos gems, Lu Ming finally broke through to the true Emperor realm and became a one-star true Emperor!</p><p>my current battle strength should be at the tenth level of true Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming estimated his combat ability.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, his battle power was at the ninth stage true Emperor realm.</p><p>However, the increase in combat strength was multifaceted. The most important aspect was the laws.</p><p>However, after breaking through from the illusionary divine stage to the true divine stage, the power of his world had increased by five or six times. Therefore; his combat strength had also increased by a large margin, reaching the tenth level of combat strength.</p><p>Normally, it would be difficult for one’s combat strength to increase by so much after breaking through a minor level.</p><p>a true Emperor is divided into 18 levels of battle prowess. Only when one’s cultivation reaches the peak of seven stars, the nine types of nomological laws that they control have reached the third realm, and they have mastered powerful divine abilities can they be considered to have battle prowess at level 18!</p><p>however, I don’t need to reach this step at all. I can reach rank 18 combat power!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He was different from the rest, and the strength of his body far exceeded that of ordinary people.</p><p>Furthermore, he had mastered three types of ultimate laws, while the rest were King path laws.</p><p>If his cultivation reached the peak of seven stars and all nine of his laws reached the third realm, his fighting power would naturally far exceed that of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>1 still have more than sixty chaos gems, but I’ve just made a breakthrough in my cultivation. 1 need to consolidate it first before making a breakthrough. I should focus on cultivating my nomological laws now!</p><p>Lu Ming planned the direction of his future cultivation.</p><p>When one’s nomological laws reached the second realm, there was a difference in maturity.</p><p>Many of his nomological laws had just broken through to the second realm and had not reached the peak of the second realm. There was still room for improvement.</p><p>Moreover, there was no bottleneck. It was the best choice to use the path-understanding ancient tree to comprehend.</p><p>Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and headed straight for the mature path-understanding ancient tree in two world city.</p><p>In the following days, Lu Ming was comprehending the laws under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Two world city had also calmed down.</p><p>After a few strong attacks, the non-humans didn’t succeed. Instead, they suffered heavy losses. Their plan to attack the morale of the heaven realm didn’t succeed either. During this period of time, they quieted down and didn’t continue to attack.</p><p>However, everyone knew that the foreign kinds would never give up. This was only the calm before the storm.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, another year had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been comprehending the laws under rhe mature</p><p>path-understanding ancient tree for the past year.</p><p>His nine laws had all improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>After breaking through to the second realm, there was no bottleneck. All kinds of nomological laws were rapidly approaching the peak of the second realm.</p><p>In a year, at least six or seven types of nomological laws had reached the peak of the second realm.</p><p>This caused Lu Ming’s cultivation level and combat strength to increase by another level. Lu Ming estimated that he should have the combat strength of a rank n true Emperor now.</p><p>But now, many of his laws had reached a bottleneck. If he went any further, he would reach the third realm of laws. It was very difficult to break through through through through by bitter cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to continue to the battlefield of true emperors. He could only break through quickly by fighting the alien races.</p><p>However, before he set off, Lu Ming made a trip back to his residence and refined another twenty chaos gems. This allowed Lu Ming’s cultivation to reach the level of a two^star true Emperor in one go.</p><p>Although his cultivation had broken through one stage, Lu Ming’s combat strength was still at the eleventh stage of the true Emperor realm. However, he had already reached the peak of the eleventh stage.</p><p>When everything was ready, Lu Ming quietly left two world city and headed towards the battlefield of the true emperors. He did not let anyone know.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>The empty Emperor battlefield, the true Emperor battlefield, and the great emperor battlefield were all specially set up. If the foreign races wanted to attack two world city, they would nor pass through these battlefields.</p><p>with my current fighting power, there’s no challenge in the outer area of the battlefield of true emperors. Only the core area will be challenging!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The experts in the core area of the battlefield of true emperors were all existences with the combat strength of a tenth stage true Emperor or above. It was the most suitable place for Lu Ming to fight and train.</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the core area of the battlefield of the true emperors.</p><p>If he flew like this, he would definitely be targeted by the alien races. Along the way, he was ambushed by two groups of alien races. The strongest among them was only a ninth level true Emperor. They were easily killed by Lu Ming and he obtained many crystal cores.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped into the core area of the true Emperor battlefield, he slowed down and concealed his aura. He advanced carefully.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Not long after, a dazzling red light flashed in front of them. At the same time, the sound of weapons clashing could be heard. It was obvious that there were people fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine breath spell and moved along the ground, approaching it carefully.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, there were two streaks of light in front of him. One was in front of him and rhe other was behind him. They were flying rapidly toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of him was a green sword light, and it was controlled by a green-robed elder.</p><p>Behind him was a middle-aged man in a blood-red robe. He held a blood-red saber in his hand as he chased after the green-robed old man.</p><p>it was obvious that the two of them were from the heaven realm.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The green-robed elder saw Lu Ming and roared.</p><p>However, the middle-aged man in the Crimson robe suddenly sped up and slashed with his Crimson saber.</p><p>The green-robed elder roared and tried to block it, bur it was useless. His defense was directly broken by the blood-red blade light and he was cur in half.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood-robed middle-aged man rushed over and collected the green-robed old man’s storage ring. He also dug out the old man’s world core.</p><p>I’ve met another one, and he’s so young. He’s so young and he dares to come to the core of the true Emperor battlefield. He’s quite bold, but you’re unlucky to have met me, blood Bladesman!</p><p>The blood-robed middle-aged man licked his lips and revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming s pupils constricted slightly and his expression turned grave..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
