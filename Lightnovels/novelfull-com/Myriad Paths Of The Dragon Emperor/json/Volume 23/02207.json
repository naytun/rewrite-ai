She controlled the formation and formed chains that bound the experts of the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>Those figures at the empty Emperor realm could not resist at all. They were bound by the chains and could not move no matter how much they struggled.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi were also entangled.</p><p>“It’s you, you deserve to die!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed in rage. He recognized dandan, and his eyes turned red.</p><p>They struggled madly, but it was of no use. They were tightly bound by the chains.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The LAN family’s true Emperor struggled madly, trying to break free. However, a low-level true Emperor wasn’t of much use. The chains were getting tighter and tighter.</p><p>“Relying on numbers to win, is it? Let’s see how you’re going to win by numbers.”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and walked toward LAN Yun and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare to touch me?”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed.</p><p>“Even now, you still dare to be so arrogant. You’re really stupid!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the top of LAN Yun’s head and stomped on LAN Yun’s face.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>LAN Yun’s face was firmly stepped on by Lu Ming, leaving a shoe print.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared in embarrassment and anger.</p><p>The last time he was stepped on by dandan, his face exploded and his teeth flew out. Now that his injuries had recovered, he was stepped on by Lu Ming again.</p><p>Since he was young, he had always been a proud son of the heavens. When had he ever suffered such humiliation?</p><p>However, during this period of time, in just a few days, he had been continuously stepped on the face. He really wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? It’s really f * eking unpleasant to hear!”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with disdain and stepped on LAN Yun’s face again.</p><p>This kick directly caused LAN Yun’s face to swell up, and his teeth fell out, flying out.</p><p>LAN Yun immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. A portion of it was blood from his teeth falling out, while the other portion was blood from anger. He was so angry that he vomited blood.</p><p>“Everyone, this person is lawless and lawless. Let’s attack together and take him down!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared, summoning the people from the other heaven realms.</p><p>However, the others looked at each other, and no one made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill anyone and did not hit anyone hard. He did not break the rules.</p><p>Furthermore, quite a few people were competitors with LAN Yun. Seeing LAN Yun being abused, they couldn’t even wait to be happy. Why would they stand out?</p><p>At this moment, even Yan Xi shut up and behaved herself, afraid that Lu Ming would target her.</p><p>“You still dare to shout, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on LAN Yun’s face again.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>LAN Yun wailed. Unfortunately, his entire body was locked up by chains. He stood there upright and was completely unable to move. He could only be stepped on passively.</p><p>“Kill this kid, quickly kill this kid!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>One of the LAN family’s six-star true emperors wasn’t chained up. He was still fighting against the chains.</p><p>at this moment, the world Energy on his body began to burn, and all sorts of law energy exploded with shocking power as it attacked the chains.</p><p>A six-star true Emperor was simply too powerful.</p><p>In order to break through to the true Emperor realm, one had to have a strong world force, a stable small world, and a law.</p><p>To break through to the true Emperor realm, one had to reach the second realm of three laws.</p><p>One could only imagine how terrifying the laws that a six-star true Emperor could control were.</p><p>For a moment, the formation chains condensed by dandan actually could not lock the other party.</p><p>It wasn’t that dandan’s formation wasn’t strong enough. If she was given an hour to set up the formation, she could even lock a peak true Emperor, let alone a six-star true Emperor.</p><p>However, the time given to him just now was too short.</p><p>LAN Yun’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Brat, you’re finished. I’m going to cripple you and break your four limbs!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared madly. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming continuously stomped on LAN Yun’s face. His face almost exploded.</p><p>He was no longer human and could not even recognize him.</p><p>Then, the fallen star bow appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>He suddenly pulled the fallen star bow, and a rainbow arrow appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming released his grip and the bowstring vibrated. It was so loud that people’s eardrums were buzzing. The seven-colored arrow suddenly flew out and shot toward the LAN family’s six-star true Emperor.</p><p>At such a close distance, the power of the fallen star bow was unleashed to its maximum.</p><p>However, a six-star true Emperor was too strong. He roared and released sound waves from his mouth.</p><p>The sound wave contained many different laws and charged toward the rainbow arrow.</p><p>The arrow was blocked. It trembled in the air, hitting the sound waves, but in the end, the arrow still shattered.</p><p>“Lock it!”</p><p>Dandan shouted and waved her hands continuously. Countless runes filled the air, and more chains appeared, entangling toward the LAN clan’s six-star true Emperor.</p><p>In order to resist Lu Ming’s arrow, the LAN family’s six-star true Emperor had split a bit of his strength and was almost bound by dandan’s chains.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the bowstring once again. The surging holy power was constantly surging into the bow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Another arrow was shot toward the glabella of the LAN clan’s six-star true Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>On the other side, Jian feiliu called out. He waved his hand and the long sword above his head trembled. It turned into a sword light and slashed toward the LAN clan’s six-star true Emperor. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>The LAN clan’s six-star true Emperor roared and tried his best to resist. He waved his arms continuously and released a terrifying force to resist the chains around him, Lu Ming’s arrows, and Jian feiliu’s sword light.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a loud bang, the arrow was broken and Jian feiliu’s long sword was also hit and flew back to Jian feiliu’s head.</p><p>However, the LAN family’s six-star true Emperor was too distracted in order to resist Lu Ming and Jian feiliu’s attacks. In the end, dandan seized the opportunity and countless chains flew toward the LAN family’s six-star true Emperor madly. The other party was at a disadvantage.</p><p>One, two…</p><p>A few chains wrapped around the LAN family’s six-star true Emperor’s body, causing his movements to slow down.</p><p>LAN Yun’s heart sank.</p><p>However, at this moment, rays of purple red light shot over from the distance.</p><p>It was an expert from the evil god tribe!</p><p>Clearly, the evil god tribe’s powerhouses had also been attracted by the red light emitted by Mu Lan’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. Jian feiliu’s expression also changed drastically.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the people from the evil god tribe arrived. They saw Mu Lan sitting cross-legged in the pool with a single glance, and their eyes emitted a fiery glow.</p><p>take the treasures. We can’t let the people from the heaven realm get them!</p><p>Someone from the evil god race spoke.</p><p>All of a sudden, the members of the evil god tribe charged toward Mu Lan.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. He drew the fallen star bow and shot a few arrows in succession.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A few members of the evil god race were shot to death by Lu Ming in the air.</p><p>At the same time, Jian feiliu also controlled the long sword above his head to slash at the evil god race.</p><p>However, there was a terrifying expert from the evil god tribe who punched out and sent Jian feiliu’s long sword flying. Jian feiliu’s face turned pale and he almost spat out blood.</p><p>Although his long sword was powerful, his cultivation was not high enough. He was only a two-star void Emperor, so he could not fight against those true Emperor realm experts..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
