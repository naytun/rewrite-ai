Even though the lone Shadow used three types of laws, two of which were at the second realm, they were still blocked by Lu Ming and could not do anything to him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Gu yingzhongs sword buzzed, and the sword light became even more brilliant.</p><p>“This is … The fourth law! ”</p><p>This time, even Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Gu yingchong had actually mastered a fourth type of law, which was also a King path law. Fortunately, it was only at rhe first realm, not the second realm.</p><p>But this was no small matter.</p><p>A three-star illusionary Emperor, and at such a young age at that. Yet, he had already mastered four types of laws.</p><p>One ultimate law and three king path laws.</p><p>Furthermore, the strongest law and one of the king path laws had reached the second realm. The other two King path laws were also at the completion of the first realm.</p><p>This kind of talent could be said to be shocking.</p><p>For example, LAN Yun and Van Xi, who were known as the top geniuses of the heaven realm, were about the same age as Gu yingzhong, but they had only mastered two types of laws.</p><p>I didn’t expect the Gu family to produce another top-notch heaven’s favorite!</p><p>Dandan whispered, her eyes also revealing a look of admiration.</p><p>Many of the Gu family’s people also revealed proud expressions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Using the fourth type of nomological law, although it was only at the completion of the first realm, it still increased Gu yingchong’s strength.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was sent flying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have to admit that your abilities are indeed shocking. It’s the first time I’ve seen you in my life. On account that it wasn’t easy for you to cultivate, I’ll forget about today’s matter. You can leave!”</p><p>Gu Ying said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists. Gu yingzhong could indeed be considered a gentleman. Not everyone had such magnanimity.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s purpose for coming here today had not been achieved. How could he leave just like that?</p><p>“But our battle is not over yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled again.</p><p>“You still haven’t used your full strength?”</p><p>Gu yingzhong s eyes narrowed as he spoke.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The color of the death Sword in his hand became even more dazzling. There were now two more colors.</p><p>It was the laws of alchemy and weapons.</p><p>“Six types of laws!”</p><p>Gu yingzhong exclaimed in shock, his eyes revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>The other members of the Gu family were also shocked.</p><p>He had yet to become a saint Emperor, but he could actually control six types of laws. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Could it be that the legend was true? that one of their ancestors had also mastered many laws before he became a sovereign?</p><p>At first, some people were skeptical about the legend of their ancestor, who had yet to become a sovereign, but had already mastered multiple nomological laws. This was because such a thing was simply too unbelievable. Moreover, such a long time had passed, so who knew if this legend was true or false?</p><p>However, after seeing Lu Ming today, they knew that the legend was true.</p><p>However, their shock was not over yet.</p><p>A hammer appeared in Lu Ming’s left hand.</p><p>The chaos hammer!</p><p>It was formed by the Laws of Chaos and the other six laws.</p><p>This time, the Gu family members were completely stunned.</p><p>Even Gu yingchong was the same.</p><p>They only reacted after a long time.</p><p>my God, an ultimate Maxim, two ultimate maxims!</p><p>a person who hasn’t even become a sovereign not only controls many laws but also two ultimate laws at the same time. How did he do it? unbelievable, unbelievable!</p><p>Regardless of whether they were the older or younger members of the Gu family, they were all shocked beyond words.</p><p>Controlling two ultimate maxims had completely broken their understanding of maxims. Naturally, they were shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a group of people flew out from the depths of the purple bamboo forest.</p><p>There were at least a hundred of them, and a few of them were emitting shocking cultivation. They were all great emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. The heaven realm was indeed worthy of its name. It had been passed down for countless years and its experts were indeed amazing. It was just a lone family bur there were already four to five great emperors.</p><p>It was hard to imagine.</p><p>For example, there weren’t many great emperors in the entire region of Mount Yuan.</p><p>In fact, it wasn’t that the primordial realm s strength was that far from rhe heaven realm s.</p><p>There was a difference, but it was not so ridiculous.</p><p>The main thing was that many strong practitioners of rhe primordial realm had left the primordial realm and come to the heaven realm to participate in the war and cultivate.</p><p>Some of the Overlord forces in the divine fared land were also very powerful, and there were many experts who stayed there.</p><p>“Greetings, patriarch!”</p><p>The members of the Gu family all bowed to a middle-aged man.</p><p>This person was the Gu family’s master.</p><p>“Alright, let’s end this battle here!”</p><p>The master of the Gu family spoke.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Gu Ying nodded, retracted his aura, and rook a few steps back.</p><p>The Gu family’s master looked at Lu Ming in amazement. I didn’t expect that there would be such a person in the world. He hasn’t even become a sovereign, but he has mastered so many laws, even two ultimate laws. Whar a miracle!</p><p>“Master Gu is too kind, but it’s a pity that it’s difficult to become an Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>indeed, my Gu family’s ancestor also had an extremely talented figure. He controlled many nomological laws before he became a sovereign. It’s a pity that he didn’t become a sovereign in the end!</p><p>“You all came here because you heard the legend of my Gu family’s ancestor) right?”</p><p>The Gu family’s master said.</p><p>“Yes, that’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>since you have a favor to ask of me, why did you insult my ancestors? ”</p><p>An old man from the Gu family walked our, his face still somewhat indignant.</p><p>The Gu family’s master also looked at dandan.</p><p>“What insult? What do you juniors know? I already know Gu Xingyue, Gu Xing Tian, and that Gu Lingtian who has mastered many types of nomological laws even before he became a great emperor is my good friend!”</p><p>Dandan said loudly.</p><p>“You … You still dare to?”</p><p>The people of the Gu family were furious.</p><p>The master of the Gu family raised his hand, and the people of the Gu family quieted down.</p><p>“May I ask who you are?”</p><p>The master of the Gu family asked.</p><p>“Then you guys should see clearly!”</p><p>Dandan curled his lips, and his body suddenly changed into his original body.</p><p>Then, his body rapidly grew in size, turning into an incomparably huge tortoise that floated in the sky.</p><p>“This … This is the legendary top ten Battle Beast, the World Turtle!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>All the members of the Gu family widened their eyes.</p><p>The top ten warbeasts had already become legends and were no longer seen.</p><p>In the battle of the ancient past, the top ten war beasts had either died or were injured. They had long disappeared.</p><p>Many people speculated that the top ten warbeasts might have all died in battle.</p><p>He didn’t expect that one of the top ten war beasts , the World Turtle, would actually appear here.</p><p>“You … Is it the legendary senior turtle?”</p><p>The master of the Gu family was the first to react.</p><p>“Of course, you’re my old man!”</p><p>The giant turtle opened its mouth and quickly shrank, turning back into the appearance of a little Taoist priest.</p><p>Senior turtle, what’s with your cultivation?”</p><p>The master of the Gu family asked with a respectful attitude.</p><p>That was because there were indeed records in the Gu family’s ancient books that a few of the Gu family’s ancestors had a close relationship with the divine turtle of the world..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
