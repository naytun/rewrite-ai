Clearly, more people had come. This time, there were many people, dozens of them, more than the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The LAN family and Yan family shouted. They just needed a little more time and they would be able to kill Lu Ming. They did not expect that someone else would come.</p><p>“Quick, collect the alien corpses, quick!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted. He abandoned Lu Ming and quickly collected the alien corpses.</p><p>The other members of the LAN family and Yan family did not know what was going on, but they did as they were told. They collected all the bodies of the alien races, leaving only the bodies of those who came with Bai tai.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In a flash of light, dozens of people appeared in the sky.</p><p>All of them were creatures from the heaven realm, and some of them were extremely powerful.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The people who came later glanced at the corpses of Bai tai and the others, and their eyes flashed.</p><p>“Everyone, Lu Ming is extremely audacious. He killed people from the heaven realm for money and we happened to discover him. We’re going to take him down!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted and accused Lu Ming of killing Bai tai and the rest.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, How dare you!”</p><p>The people from the heaven realm who came later all looked at Lu Ming with anger in their eyes.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he laughed, the LAN family and the Yan family wanted to kill me and take away the indestructible ancient scroll. They were seen by others, so I killed them to silence them. Now, they dare to slander me. How ridiculous!</p><p>“Nonsense! Everyone, Lu Ming is a man of words. We can’t be fooled by him. 1 suggest that we arrest him first, cripple his cultivation, and bring him back to two world city for interrogation!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted.</p><p>“LAN family, Yan family, 1 will definitely make you pay for what you did today!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, turned around and left.</p><p>He knew that he was at a disadvantage today. No matter how much he argued, it would be useless. He could only escape first and then think of a way to reveal the LAN and Yan family’s crimes to the public.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his six-feathered divine wings and flew into the distance at top speed.</p><p>“Chase him, don’t let him escape! He wants to escape!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted. Together with the Yan family experts, they chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>The other people from the heaven realm looked at each other. They did not know who was telling the truth and could only watch. It was not good for them to make a move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t escape!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted. A jade talisman appeared in his hand and he crushed it. A green energy enveloped his body. His speed suddenly increased and he quickly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He turned around and drew his bow, shooting an arrow at the man.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in the man’s hand. He slashed out and collided with the arrow, causing it to explode. His body slowed down slightly, but he continued to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The leader of the LAN family slashed a few times in succession. The sword Qi whistled and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged continuously, but he was still hit by a sword Qi. He spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying.</p><p>no, 1 can’t escape like this. I’ll go to that small world and try my luck!</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming dashed towards the place where there was a spatial fluctuation.</p><p>The experts from the LAN and Yan families were in hot pursuit.</p><p>As they chased, the leader of the LAN family kept slashing out sword Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming could only draw his bow to block and at the same time, try his best to Dodge.</p><p>However, after a few moves, Lu Ming was hit again. His body was almost split apart.</p><p>However, with the indestructible ancient scroll, Lu Ming was fine. His injuries were recovering rapidly.</p><p>After a while, a huge black Vortex appeared in front of him.</p><p>It was obvious that this was the entrance to the small world.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look back and rushed in directly.</p><p>The leader of the LAN family also rushed in. The two of them were the fastest, while the others were a little slower.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming rushed into the vortex, he appeared in a void.</p><p>However, the scene that entered his eyes made Lu Ming’s eyes narrow.</p><p>The ground of this small world cracked open, and many hideous cracks appeared. The world was barren.</p><p>In the sky, there were spatial cracks that kept flashing.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not have time to think and rushed forward.</p><p>Behind him, a fluctuation came. The leader of the LAN family had also appeared.</p><p>The moment he came out, he was also shocked by the scene in front of him.</p><p>However, when he saw Lu Ming, his eyes were filled with killing intent as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The leader of the LAN family used his World Energy and displayed his full power. His battle power of a level 17 true Emperor was revealed.</p><p>The sword Qi cut through the void, and the space directly exploded.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He wanted to use the fallen star bow to block the attack but he stopped.</p><p>The leader of the LAN family’s expression also changed greatly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the entire world began to shake violently as the sky exploded.</p><p>The leader of the LAN family’s sword strikes seemed to have lit a fuse, causing the entire world to collapse and explode.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family realized that something was wrong. He turned around and was about to leave through that entrance.</p><p>But with a boom, the entrance also exploded.</p><p>The exit had collapsed!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The earth crumbled, and dense spatial cracks appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family kept roaring in fear.</p><p>“This is a small world that is about to collapse!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth was full of bitterness.</p><p>At this moment, how could he not understand?</p><p>This small world must have been floating in the eternal void for countless years and was about to collapse. When they rushed in and unleashed their cultivation, they broke the balance and caused the world to collapse.</p><p>The power of the collapse of a small world was extremely terrifying.</p><p>In particular, this small world could very likely belong to a powerful existence, so it was even more powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Si la!</p><p>The ground exploded, and the sky was filled with cracks. More and more cracks appeared, revealing a dark void. A terrifying spatial storm swept in all directions.</p><p>Given Lu Ming and the LAN family’s leader’s combat abilities, it would be fine if they entered the dark void. However, if they were to be swept up by the space storm caused by the collapse of the small world, they would definitely die.</p><p>The two of them tried their best to Dodge.</p><p>However, after a while, the entire world, the entire space, was filled with spatial storms, and there was almost nowhere to hide.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, it’s all your fault, it’s all your fault, 1 want you to die!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family roared madly, blaming everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not rushed in, why would he have chased after him?</p><p>If Lu Ming had not fled and allowed him to kill him, how could such a thing have happened?</p><p>He roared angrily and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in a spatial storm, the leader of the LAN family screamed. The lower half of his body was torn apart, leaving only the upper half to escape. He almost died..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
