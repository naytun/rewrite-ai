He’s not dead!</p><p>“Damn it, the people who chased after him before are most likely dead!”</p><p>Some of the evil god tribe members roared in anger.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air a hundred miles away with a sneer on his face. He then stretched out his middle finger and pointed downwards.</p><p>This provocative action infuriated the evil god tribe even more.</p><p>Lu Ming then took out the fallen star bow and pulled the bowstring.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A rainbow-colored bowstring shot out toward one of the evil god tribe members.</p><p>The evil god tribe member was a high-stage true Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill the void Thearch. Killing a few more void thearchs would not help the overall situation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the arrow arrived in front of the high-level void Emperor.</p><p>you’re courting death! the evil god race member bellowed as a destructive light shot out from his third eye, clashing with the arrow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a burst of dazzling light in the sky. The arrow that Lu Ming shot was destroyed.</p><p>As expected, with his current cultivation level, his arrows were useless against true emperors. He couldn’t kill them, let alone high-stage true emperors.</p><p>However, this action completely infuriated the high-stage true Emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was too lazy to care. He shot a few more arrows in succession, aiming at the advanced true emperors.</p><p>Of course, they couldn’t hurt each other, but they had completely infuriated each other.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill this ant!”</p><p>In an instant, a few members of the evil god tribe charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of four of them, and they were all high-stage true emperors. They were extremely terrifying and had shocking speed.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and ran. He flapped his six-feathered wings continuously and ran toward the place where dandan had set up the formation.</p><p>However, the evil god tribe members behind him closed the distance between them rapidly.</p><p>They were both advanced-stage true emperors and their speed was too fast. Even Lu Ming’s six-feathered divine wings were useless as the distance between them was closing rapidly.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a distance of a few thousand miles and he could cover it in an instant. If he was any further, Lu Ming would really be caught up.</p><p>Even so, when Lu Ming ran to the place where dandan set up the big array, he was almost caught up by the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming swooped down and flew along the ground. The other party followed suit and chased after Lu Ming at a high speed.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members ‘eyes shone with a terrifying light as he shot a destructive light at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s dangerous!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This destructive light was too terrifying. If he was hit, he would die.</p><p>As Lu Ming rushed forward, he turned around and drew the bow.</p><p>An arrow flew toward the destruction light beam but was destroyed by it. The destruction light beam did not stop and continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t tell me I have to use the celestial Emperor’s sword!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Lu Ming did not want to use the energy of the celestial Thearch’s body unless he had no other choice.</p><p>This time, the amount of energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was not much, only a little more than ten percent. Once used, it would be easy to exhaust the energy inside.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding void lit up, and a turtle shell condensed to block the light beam.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The destructive beam of light struck the turtle shell and produced a violent boom. The turtle shell was not destroyed and had blocked the destructive beam of light.</p><p>“We’ve arrived at the formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>At this time, dandan’s figure appeared in the sky. His body was filled with endless runes, communicating with the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He shouted in a low voice. Countless runes appeared on the ground and in the air. Then, the runes condensed into divine beasts.</p><p>There were true dragons, phoenixes, Qilins, and great ROCs.</p><p>These divine beasts surrounded the four members of the evil god race.</p><p>“Not good, we’ve fallen into a trap. Charge out!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members was shocked. He knew that he had fallen into a trap.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now!”</p><p>Dandan sneered.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The true dragon roared as it twisted its body and pounced toward one of the evil god race members.</p><p>At the same time, the Phoenix let out a long cry, the ROC spread its wings, and the Qilin stepped into the sky…</p><p>All of the godly beasts pounced toward the four members of the evil god race.</p><p>The four members of the evil god race unleashed their full power and tried their best to resist the impact. The aura caused Lu Ming to tremble.</p><p>he’s so strong! He’s at least a five star true Emperor, or even a six star true Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly clicked his tongue.</p><p>Back then, in the ancient Moon sanctuary, Lu Ming had exterminated the Golden Crow clan, the WAN family, the Wind Clan, and many others. At that time, he had controlled the heaven and earth physical body and felt the power of those advanced stage true emperors.</p><p>For example, the patriarch of the Golden Crow clan, the head of the WAN clan, the head of the Phoenix Palace, and so on. The strength of these overlords was only so-so.</p><p>However, the four great evil god tribe’s powerhouses were completely no match for the various divine beasts. It was a complete one-sided battle.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The arm of an evil god was torn off by the true dragon, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Following that, the chest of another member of the evil god race was pierced through by the sharp claws of the Phoenix. The next moment, the great ROC flew over, and its wings were like blades as it chopped off the head of the member of the evil god race.</p><p>The battle was one-sided, and it did not take long for the four evil god tribe powerful beings to be killed.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Dandan said that his big array could kill a peak true Emperor. It was indeed true.</p><p>“One six star true Emperor and three five star true emperors. Haha, the harvest this time is not bad. I think more than half of the peak experts of the other party have come!”</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>There were more than a hundred people on the other side, but there weren’t many high-stage true emperors. There were only six or seven of them, and four of them had been killed in an instant.</p><p>After all, it wasn’t easy for a high stage true Emperor to come here. It was very dangerous.</p><p>As long as he could get rid of the opponent’s high-stage true Emperor, he wouldn’t have to fear them anymore.</p><p>let’s pack up and hide. The other party will most likely send someone over to investigate when they see that these people have not returned!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>Dandan nodded and cleaned up the evil god tribe’s corpses. The two of them then flashed to a Mountain Valley not far away.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of raw gemstones and absorbed their energy to recover his holy power.</p><p>He had been drawing the bow and shooting seven to eight arrows, which consumed a lot of his Saint power.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s holy power was restored to its peak.</p><p>However, no evil god tribe had come over.</p><p>The two of them were puzzled.</p><p>Logically speaking, the evil god race would definitely send people over to investigate if the powerful true emperors had not returned. However, not a single one of the evil god race had come.</p><p>This was very strange!</p><p>“Could it be that they have already broken through the castle’s Gate and entered the castle? Lu Ming, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the two of them flew towards the castle.</p><p>However, not long after he flew out, he heard intense battle cries.</p><p>At the entrance of the castle, there was a fierce battle.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming and dandan could see that the ones who attacked the evil god tribe were LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the other heaven realm people.</p><p>There were more people from the heaven realm, more than 200 of them. Compared to the last time they had gathered in the valley, there were many more experts. There were even a few high-stage true emperors, completely suppressing the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Damn it, these people actually took advantage of us!”</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth.</p><p>They had killed four of the enemy’s high-stage true emperors, but these people had taken advantage of them. This made dandan very unhappy..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
