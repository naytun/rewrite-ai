Lu Ming could sense that there were terrifying experts among them.</p><p>Although there were no great emperors, there were definitely level 16 and level 17 true emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming was severely injured now. He was no match for these alien races and could only avoid them for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his six-feathered divine wings and flew into the distance at top speed.</p><p>The alien races were following closely behind.</p><p>which heavenly domain is this? he said that the human race has escaped. It seems that there are still human beings in this heavenly domain!</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking as he flew.</p><p>Behind him, the alien races were very fast, especially a few of them. They were shockingly powerful and were slowly closing the distance between them and Lu Ming.</p><p>“My injuries are too severe, 1 can’t use my full strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, thinking of a solution.</p><p>After a while, he had flown tens of thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p>But at this moment, another group of foreign people appeared in front of them. There were more than twenty of them.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to change his direction and dash to the left. In this way, the distance between him and the opponent’s powerhouse was shortened.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly thought of countermeasures.</p><p>He could have taken out the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to resist the other party’s attack, but that would be like catching a turtle in a jar.</p><p>In such a situation, it was not desirable at all.</p><p>Lu Ming could only continue flying.</p><p>“Human, die!”</p><p>The few alien races slowly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the fallen star bow and shot a few arrows in succession. However, these alien races were very powerful and they were all blocked.</p><p>He pulled the fallen star bow forcefully, worsening his injuries.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming flew past a high mountain that reached into the clouds and entered a huge Canyon.</p><p>The foreign races had also charged into the great canyon.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a series of attacks burst out from the canyon.</p><p>These attacks were not aimed at Lu Ming, but at the alien races.</p><p>In an instant, seven to eight foreign kinds were killed. The foreign kinds who were chasing Lu Ming were also stopped.</p><p>“Kill, kill these foreign kinds!”</p><p>Roars came from the canyon as more than 20 figures rushed out.</p><p>“A human, a divine beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned, then he was overjoyed.</p><p>These people who rushed out were actually humans. There were also divine beasts, and they were all very powerful.</p><p>One of them, a middle-aged man, held a battle blade. When he slashed out, the blade light was vast and powerful. Two of the outsiders with the battle power of a rank 16 true Emperor were killed, and one of them with the battle power of a rank 17 true Emperor was severely injured.</p><p>this is a peak true Emperor. He has the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In addition, there were also a few with battle strength at rank 17 and rank 16 true emperors.</p><p>It was a one-sided battle. Dozens of foreign kinds were killed continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming could not care less about his injuries. He kept drawing the fallen star bow and killed a few of the foreign tribe members who escaped.</p><p>There were a total of 40 to 50 alien races. Not long after, they were all killed and their bodies were collected by those people.</p><p>Then, those people’s gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Everyone, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>“Who are you? Why have I never seen him before? Could it be that there are other small worlds that have yet to be conquered by the non-humankind?”</p><p>A young woman stepped on the air and looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>This woman was very beautiful. She wore iron armor, which revealed her impressive figure.</p><p>“Other small worlds?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a confused look.</p><p>“Everyone, may 1 ask what this place is? Which heavenly domain?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“Which heavenly domain? Of course we’re in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain. Are you not from there?”</p><p>The young woman asked, very curious.</p><p>The others also walked over and sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>ten thousand spirit heavenly domain! I’m actually in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Ten thousand spirit heavenly domain was one of the nine heavenly domains in the heaven realm and had long been occupied by alien races.</p><p>It seemed that he had been swept into the ten thousand spirit realm by the power of the collapse of the small world.</p><p>“I’m not happy with all of you, I’m from the Tai Qing heavenly region!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? You’re from the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>The young woman and the others all widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>Then, their eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>“We know from the alien races that the Tai Qing heavenly region has not been conquered and is still in the hands of the heaven realm. Is that true? How did you come to ten thousand spirit heavenly domain? Is there a secret passage?”</p><p>The young woman asked a lot of questions in a row, and the others were also curious.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and his face turned pale.</p><p>At this moment, he was seriously injured.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place first. This little brother’s injuries are very serious. It won’t be too late for us to ask him after he’s recovered!”</p><p>An old man walked over and said.</p><p>“I was too excited. Let’s go!”</p><p>The young woman said. Immediately, the young woman waved out a wave of World Energy and flew in one direction with Lu Ming and the twenty people.</p><p>During this time, they kept changing directions as if they were afraid of being pursued by the alien race. Not long after, they came to a secret place and entered an underground space through a secret path.</p><p>After arriving, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to recuperate.</p><p>He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll and his injuries recovered rapidly. In less than two hours, Lu Ming’s injuries were completely healed and he was back to his peak condition.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had fully recovered in just two hours, those people were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were definitely not light. An ordinary person would need at least ten days to half a month to recover from such injuries. However, Lu Ming had recovered in just two hours. They were shocked and curious.</p><p>“Thank you for your help earlier!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and thanked everyone.</p><p>“We’re all heaven realm beings, it’s only right for us to help!”</p><p>The young woman laughed. She was very forthright.</p><p>Among these people, the young woman was the only one from the younger generation. She was around the same age as Lu Ming and naturally, they were more friendly.</p><p>“I’m Ren Chan, what’s your name?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>“My name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Can you tell me how you came from the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>Ren Chan blinked his eyes and asked curiously.</p><p>“I accidentally entered a small world that was about to collapse …”</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained how he came to this place.</p><p>“I see. 1 thought there was some secret passage!”</p><p>Ren Chan sighed in disappointment.</p><p>The others also sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming had entered this place through a small world that was about to collapse. This was a complete coincidence and could not be replicated.</p><p>If there was a secret passage, they could use it to go to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>“Right, what’s the situation here …”</p><p>Lu Ming asked about the situation in the ten thousand spirit realm.</p><p>Immediately, Ren Chan also told him some of the situation in ten thousand spirit heavenly domain..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
