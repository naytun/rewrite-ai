He deserves it!”</p><p>LAN Yun laughed heartily in his heart. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he began to struggle, wanting to break free from the restraints of the chains.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The LAN family’s six-star true Emperor finally broke free and came to LAN Yun’s side to protect him.</p><p>let’s attack together and kill the evil god race! We can’t let the evil god race get their hands on the treasures!</p><p>Dandan shouted and urged the others to take action.</p><p>Many people looked at each other and made their move.</p><p>There was nothing they could do about the evil god race. They were their common enemy. No matter who got their hands on the treasure, they could not let it fall into the hands of the evil god race.</p><p>However, the heaven realm’s people were too late. Some of the evil god tribe’s powerhouses had already gotten close to Mu Lan.</p><p>Jian feiliu was the only one beside Mu Lan, so he couldn’t stop her at all.</p><p>it seems like I can only use the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body!</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden thought. Just as he was about to use the celestial Thearch’s body, a layer of radiance suddenly emanated from the cave behind Mu Lan and Jian feiliu and blocked them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The experts of the evil god race had arrived. Their terrifying attacks slammed into the light. However, the light did not move at all. Not even a ripple was produced.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Jian Fei was overjoyed.</p><p>Then, a figure walked out of the cave.</p><p>It was an old man with a head full of white hair. He wore a gray robe and had a cold expression.</p><p>No one could sense any aura from him, nor could they tell his cultivation level. He was just like an ordinary person.</p><p>However, after he swept his gaze over them, everyone’s hair stood on end. It was a terrifying sight.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>One of the evil god tribe’s high-stage true emperors had a look of fear on his face. He let out a loud roar and retreated frantically.</p><p>evil god race, kill!</p><p>The gray-robed elder said coldly.</p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, many long swords appeared in the air and shot out. All of the evil god tribe members had their foreheads pierced through.</p><p>Whether it was the illusory Emperor or the true Emperor, under the sword light, there was no difference. They were like babies, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>All of a sudden, all 100 or so members of the evil god race were completely annihilated.</p><p>Si si…</p><p>On the side of the heavenly realm, everyone gasped.</p><p>This grey-robed elder was definitely a terrifying expert. He was at least at the great emperor realm. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to kill a high-stage true Emperor so easily.</p><p>However, how did a great emperor realm expert come here?</p><p>Could it be that the other party had been living here all this time?</p><p>However, one thing was for sure, the other party was from the heaven realm, a friend and not an enemy!</p><p>“So it’s this guy. This guy is actually not dead yet!”</p><p>Dandan came to Lu Ming’s side and muttered softly.</p><p>“You know him?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>1 do. We’ve met once before. However, he’s just a junior. When you see me, you have to respectfully call me senior!</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and started to brag again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still very shocked.</p><p>It was obvious that this was a figure from the same era as dandan, an ancient powerhouse who had lived until now.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party had not died after the battle that year.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Jian feiliu saluted the old man respectfully.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The gray-robed old man nodded, then looked at the people from the heaven realm and said in a cold voice,” “You all can leave this place, this is this old man’s cultivation ground!”</p><p>“It’s senior!”</p><p>Some people cupped their fists and did not dare to say anything more. They bowed to the old man and turned to leave.</p><p>“Master, these two are my friends!”</p><p>Jian feiliu pointed at Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>“Can they stay?”</p><p>The gray-robed old man swept a glance at dandan and Lu Ming, especially at dandan a few more times.</p><p>“Senior, can you allow me to take the two of them away?”</p><p>LAN Yun spoke.</p><p>At this moment, he had already broken free from the chains with the help of his subordinates. He understood that he would not be able to get the treasure, but he did not want to let Lu Ming and dandan off just like that. He wanted to take them away.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The grey-robed old man’s reply was only one word.</p><p>“Senior, I’m the descendant of the LAN family. Please give me some face …”</p><p>LAN Yun cupped his fists.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>This time, the gray-robed old man’s voice was even colder. A powerful force burst out with the word ‘scram’ and gushed toward LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>The expressions of LAN Yun and the others changed drastically. Their bodies were sent flying and they fell to the ground, each of them spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Even the six-star true Emperor didn’t have the power to fight back.</p><p>“Young master, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>The six-star true Emperor took LAN Yun and the group of people and retreated in a sorry state. They disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>hahaha, evil swordsman, long time no see. 1 didn’t expect you to still be alive!</p><p>After the people from the heaven realm left, dandan laughed and walked over to greet the gray-robed old man.</p><p>Jian feiliu was dumbfounded.</p><p>The gray-robed old man glanced at dandan coldly and said,” “It’s you, you cowardly fellow. You really didn’t die. It’s true that good people don’t live long, while scoundrels live for a thousand years!”</p><p>“Hey, you … What are you saying?”</p><p>Dandan was displeased, her eyes wide open.</p><p>The grey-robed old man no longer paid attention to dandan. His figure flashed and he entered the cave.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“Brat, what are you laughing at…”</p><p>Dandan glared at Lu Ming. He had just bragged that the gray-robed elder was his junior. Now, he was being treated like this by the gray-robed elder. He really could not bring himself to lose face.</p><p>sigh, people’s hearts are not what they used to be. Seeing that my cultivation is low now, I’m no longer the same as I was in the past. This attitude is so sad and lamentable!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming! Long time no see!”</p><p>At this moment, Jian feiliu walked over and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s been a long time indeed. It’s been more than ten years, almost twenty years!</p><p>Lu Ming said, sighing that time had passed too quickly.</p><p>It had been such a long time since they last met. Fortunately, Jian feiliu was not only fine, but his cultivation had also skyrocketed and he had become a monarch. It was really hard to predict.</p><p>“This senior is…”</p><p>Jian feiliu looked at dandan with a respectful expression.</p><p>Dandan actually knew his master, so he naturally regarded dandan as a senior expert.</p><p>“I am the invincible …”</p><p>Dandan placed her hands behind her back and began to brag.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately interrupted him. he’s just a quack. He brags all day. Ignore him!</p><p>“What? Lu Ming, what did you just say?”</p><p>Dandan was unhappy. She gritted her teeth and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“That’s right, brother Jian, what happened to you back then? Also, Senior Sister Mu Lan, why is she here? what’s her condition now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions in succession. He was indeed full of questions.</p><p>“Mu Lan is your Senior Sister?”</p><p>Jian feiliu was surprised.</p><p>that’s right, she’s my Senior Sister. Previously, there was a change in the divine wilderness continent and a passageway appeared. Six years ago, Senior Sister Mu Lan stepped into that passageway and never returned. 1 stepped into that passageway not long ago as well, and that’s how I ended up here!</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the matter..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
