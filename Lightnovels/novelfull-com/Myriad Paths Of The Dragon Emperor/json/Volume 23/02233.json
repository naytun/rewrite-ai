You’re asking for a beating!”</p><p>Pao Pao pouted as she looked at LAN Yun, Yan Xi and the rest unkindly.</p><p>it’s her! That space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi had also recognized bubbles.</p><p>A young top ten war beast was too rare, and its talent was astonishing.</p><p>Bubbles ‘arrival had caused a stir back then. Many people knew that a space-time spirit mouse had come from the primordial realm.</p><p>Furthermore, the moment he arrived, he was taken in as a disciple by a terrifying God beast and was taught with great care. He improved at an amazing speed and his battle strength was even stronger.</p><p>During this period of time, many heaven’s favorites have lost to her.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi naturally knew about it as well.</p><p>At the same time, they were also rather afraid of the existence behind bubbles.</p><p>They did not expect Lu Ming to know bubbles and that they seemed to be on good terms.</p><p>“Hey, tell me. Are you and you the ones who want to go against brother Lu Ming? If you want to make a move, you’ll have to get past me first!”</p><p>Bubbles waved her little fists and glanced at LAN Yun and Yan Xi.</p><p>“This is none of your business!”</p><p>LAN Yun coldly spoke.</p><p>“Who says it’s not related!”</p><p>Pao Pao glared at LAN Yun.</p><p>“You’d better stay out of this. The LAN family might not be afraid of the person behind you!”</p><p>LAN Yun spoke again.</p><p>“Nonsense, if you want to fight, then fight, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Paoba was enraged and was about to attack.</p><p>“Bubble, I can handle these people myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stopped bubbles.</p><p>“Oh, okay. Brother Lu Ming, beat them up for me, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles shouted. Then, she turned her gaze and saw dandan. Her big eyes immediately lit up, and with a move, she immediately appeared on dandan’s shoulder.</p><p>“Little turtle, long time no see, chirpy!”</p><p>Pao Pao blinked her large eyes as she sized up dandan.</p><p>Although dandan had transformed into a human and had even used a mysterious technique to conceal her aura, bubbles and dandan were both top ten war beasts and had extremely sharp senses. Bubbles recognized dandan with a single glance.</p><p>Dandan’s face turned even darker.</p><p>“You’re the little turtle! Your entire family are little turtles!”</p><p>Dandan said unhappily.</p><p>“You’re clearly the little turtle, aren’t you? Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Paopao pouted and said.</p><p>“Don’t compare me to an ordinary little turtle …” Dandan said angrily as she and bubbles stared at each other and bickered.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and glanced at LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and Yuan Xin. He said indifferently,” “Since you all want to kill me, then come at me together. Don’t waste time!”</p><p>His words shocked everyone present.</p><p>“What? This cripple actually asked LAN Yun and the others to attack him together. Is he crazy?”</p><p>although his combat strength is not bad, he’s simply courting death by being so arrogant!</p><p>The others were shocked, and the faces of LAN Yun and the others became even gloomier.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to fight the three of them alone. He was simply courting death. This was an insult to them.</p><p>“I alone am enough to deal with you!”</p><p>LAN Yun made the first move. He shot out a punch, and a lion’s roar reverberated through the firmament.</p><p>On his fist, there was a Lion jumping and roaring, its power shocking.</p><p>This was a mystical ability passed down in LAN Yun’s family, and it came from an ancient scripture.</p><p>Compared to three years ago, LAN Yun was undoubtedly more powerful. Not only did he have a breakthrough in cultivation, but his nomological laws were also more profound. He had already comprehended a third type of nomological law and had reached the stage of the first realm perfection.</p><p>With a punch, the lion’s roar shook the sky and the wind howled, crushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He simply struck out with his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming still only used the chaos law, the extremity law, the engulfing law, and the penetration law in this palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s physical body trembled and an even stronger force erupted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with LAN Yun’s fist, and a shocking tremor erupted.</p><p>Then, LAN Yun retreated rapidly. The lion on his fist let out a wail and exploded.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>LAN Yun retreated a few dozen steps, his eyes revealing shock and disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually forced him back with one palm. How was this possible?</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming’s abilities were only slightly stronger than his.</p><p>After three years, his combat strength had increased tremendously. Why was he forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s palm?</p><p>Didn’t lu Ming have a crippled body? he could not become an Emperor. Why did his strength progress so shockingly? He really could not figure it out.</p><p>The others couldn’t figure it out either, and they all opened their mouths wide.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s pupils also constricted, and her heart trembled.</p><p>I’ve said it before. The three of you should come at me together. Don’t waste my time!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and Yuan Xin’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t know whether to retreat or fight.</p><p>“If you guys aren’t going to do it, I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely powerful. He stepped into the air and attacked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He struck out three palm strikes in a row. Three powerful palm prints whizzed out and headed toward Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi respectively.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish. Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Yan Xi shouted.</p><p>He made his move. A saber appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>LAN Yun attacked as well. His fists were constantly blasting out, and there was a Lion jumping on both fists, constantly roaring. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>At the same time, Yuan Xin made his move as well. He used all his strength and waved his fists. He condensed a mountain with all his strength and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Yuan Xin had undoubtedly become stronger. During the battle of the ten lands, he had only mastered a single law super power Technique. Now, he had mastered a higher level super power Technique. Every attack had the explosion of several laws, with chaos laws as the core, and its power was shocking.</p><p>The three of them joined forces, and the void was boiling. They were completely destroyed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Their attacks collided with Lu Ming’s palm print. The void rumbled continuously and the force swept in all directions. Some of the weaker cultivators were forced to retreat.</p><p>However, what was shocking was that after the collision, Lu Ming’s body did not move at all. He stood in the void and his expression was very calm.</p><p>He was fighting one against three, and he didn’t feel like he was at a disadvantage at all.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Yuan Xin bellowed in her heart. The power of the world erupted in full force, and mountains crushed toward Lu Ming, trying to crush him into pieces.</p><p>At the same time, LAN Yun and Yan Xi roared as they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s nothing more than this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. This time, he pointed three fingers in a row.</p><p>This was the chaos finger tribulation, but its power had far exceeded that of the chaos Ring.</p><p>Because of this finger, Lu Ming had fused five types of laws.</p><p>Chaos laws, devour laws, extremity laws, penetration laws, and array Dao laws!</p><p>In the Gu family, Lu Ming often sparred with dandan. Dandan’s understanding and application of the law had reached an unimaginable level. Lu Ming had also benefited a lot. His application of the law was far superior to Yuan Xin and the others.</p><p>The power of the convergence of five laws was astonishing.</p><p>Five huge fingers surrounded by five colors shot toward Yuan Xin and the other two..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
