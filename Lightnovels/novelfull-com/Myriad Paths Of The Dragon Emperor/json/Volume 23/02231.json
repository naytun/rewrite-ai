He was a very good heaven’s pride expert in the heaven realm. His combat strength was far above Luo cangqiong’s, and he was not much weaker than the star River.</p><p>But now, he was killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Wasn’t lu Ming’s combat strength even stronger than the current Galaxy?</p><p>Didn’t lu Ming have a crippled body? if he could not become a Martial Emperor, how could his combat strength increase so quickly?</p><p>They couldn’t figure it out. All they could think of now was to run.</p><p>The star River and Luo cangqiong retreated at almost the same time.</p><p>“Seeing that you can’t win, you want to run, have you asked me? He he he!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and caught up with Luo cangqiong in an instant like a ray of light.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>The unfamiliar young man’s combat strength was above his, but he was killed by Lu Ming in one move. If Lu Ming wanted to kill him, he would not need a second move.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. If you kill me, my grandfather will never let you off!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong roared.</p><p>“Your grandfather? He already attacked me in the primordial realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, he’s seriously injured now, and 1 don’t know where he’s gone to recuperate. I’ll personally take his head one day!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He had to kill Luo cangqiong.</p><p>Back then, it was because of Luo cangqiong that Qiu Yue had fallen into a desperate situation and almost couldn’t wake up.</p><p>Later on, Luo cangqiong’s grandfather, Emperor tianluo, met up with the Emperor of the MU family and went to the ancient Moon sanctuary to kill him.</p><p>It could be said that he, the Daluo heaven sect, and the Luo family had long been mortal enemies.</p><p>Even if Luo cangqiong didn’t come to him, he would go to him.</p><p>Since he had met him today, he would not let him go.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, Luo cangqiong roared in disbelief.</p><p>“Have a safe trip!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently and pointed his finger.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Without any suspense, Luo cangqiong’s glabella was pierced through by the finger force. His soul was destroyed and he died on the spot.</p><p>At this point, the two King physiques of the Daluo heaven sect had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After killing Luo cangqiong, Lu Ming chased after him in the star River.</p><p>At this moment, the Galaxy used all its strength and flew at high speed.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he did not leave today, he would not be able to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his imagination.</p><p>However, he still had hope.</p><p>Lu Ming had a crippled body and could never become a Martial Emperor. Even if he could improve his combat strength, there was a limit.</p><p>He, on the other hand, could continue to improve. He did not believe that he would not be able to kill Lu Ming after he broke through to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>As long as he was alive, he would be able to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>So he used all his strength to run for his life, but when he looked back, he was scared out of his wits.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming was not far away from him.</p><p>“Heng Xing River, go down and accompany Luo cangqiong, so that he won’t be lonely!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He displayed his six-feathered divine wings, and his speed was extremely shocking. With a flap of his transparent wings, he approached the eternal Star River.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Galaxy stopped and shouted. An eternal God clock appeared and vibrated.</p><p>Now, the cultivation base of the Galaxy was much stronger than before. It had reached the three-star void Emperor realm, the second realm of the eternal law, and it had also mastered a King path law.</p><p>Hence, the power of the eternal God Bell was many times stronger than it had been in the past.</p><p>Layers of sound waves rushed out and turned into sharp swords, slashing at Lu Ming. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“This move again. Star River, this move is useless Against Me!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently and struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void exploded, and the terrifying palm force rushed toward the star River like a mountain.</p><p>The sharp swords formed by the sound waves of the eternal God Bell exploded and collapsed one after another.</p><p>The power of the palm did not stop. It surged towards the stellar River and bombarded the eternal God Bell.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The eternal God Bell trembled violently and cracks appeared on it. Xinghe’s body was sent flying like a cannonball and he coughed up blood in the air. “How is that possible?”</p><p>The Galaxy roared in disbelief.</p><p>How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so strong?</p><p>In the five years he had been in the heaven realm, the eternal Star River had obtained a large amount of resources. There were even some great figures who valued him and took him in as a disciple. He was a heavenly Emperor. After being a disciple of the heavenly Emperor and being nurtured by the heavenly Emperor, he had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>His combat strength had also soared. But even so, after five years, he was even more vulnerable when he met Lu Ming again.</p><p>He found it hard to accept!</p><p>these people are so weak. They came to kill Lu Ming?”</p><p>Dandan pursed her lips, feeling speechless.</p><p>“Eh, he’s completely courting death!”</p><p>Gu yingzhong was also speechless.</p><p>Meanwhile, the surrounding onlookers were also in a heated discussion.</p><p>“Who is that person? What powerful combat strength!”</p><p>I heard them talking about a peerless cripple. What’s that about?”</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>1 know. I heard that the primordial realm produced a peerless cripple who has yet to become a sovereign, but he has already mastered many nomological laws, even two of the strongest nomological laws!</p><p>“What? He can control two types of ultimate laws?”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Many people exclaimed, but even more people didn’t believe it.</p><p>They didn’t believe that anyone could master two ultimate maxims. It was impossible. No one had ever done it in history.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming did not stop and continued to charge toward the Galaxy.</p><p>Casting the six-feathered divine wings, Lu Ming’s speed was extremely fast. With a flash of his wings, he crossed the void and caught up with the eternal Star River in an instant.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm again and it hit the eternal God Bell in the Galaxy.</p><p>This time, the eternal God clock that covered Xinghe’s body exploded. Xinghe’s body emitted the sound of bones breaking. His body was sent flying and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming had not used his full strength. His palm only contained four types of laws.</p><p>Chaos law, devour law, penetration law, and extreme law.</p><p>In the past few years, Lu Ming had improved too much.</p><p>After refining a trace of energy from the ancestral dragon blood, his physical strength had increased greatly.</p><p>At the same time, the law of alchemy, the law of craftsmanship, and the law of penetration were perfected one after another. Lu Ming’s body and Saint energy had improved a lot after tempering his body and Saint energy.</p><p>The strength of the Galaxy was not weaker than LAN Yun and Yan Xi, whom Lu Ming had encountered three years ago.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming would need to use all his strength to fight against experts like LAN Yun or Yan Xi.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had also used four types of laws. He had not even used his ultimate move and he could already achieve a crushing defeat. He could completely crush them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming chased after the Galaxy.</p><p>The stellar River erupted in a frenzy as it tried its best to escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me! My master is the celestial Thearch …”</p><p>At the same time, Xing Chen roared and brought up his master, hoping that Lu Ming would have some reservations.</p><p>However, he knew very well that Lu Ming was a lawless person. He could not be intimidated.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming was unmoved and continued to chase after him.</p><p>The eternal Star River revealed a look of despair.</p><p>“Lu Ming, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a furious roar was heard. Then, a terrifying fist force blasted toward Lu Ming from the sky..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
