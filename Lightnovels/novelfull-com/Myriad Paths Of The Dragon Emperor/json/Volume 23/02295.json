Sometimes, he would spar with Ren Chan. Sometimes, he would go out with them to obtain resources. Very quickly, two years had passed.</p><p>In the first year, Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and the rest went out often. In the second year, they rarely went out.</p><p>In the second year, the number of alien races in ten thousand spirit heavenly region had increased again, and there were many more Masters.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that the alien races had stopped attacking the Tai Qing heaven and had retreated.</p><p>Moreover, during this time, there were many more foreign races in the land of dusk.</p><p>In the entire ten thousand spirit heavenly domain, only the land of dusk hadn’t been conquered yet. Obviously, the alien races were very curious about this area and had sent a large number of Masters to conquer it.</p><p>During this period of time, the foreign races had been attacking the land of dusk. The entire land of dusk was rumbling. The foreign races were bombarding the ground and destroying the structure of the Earth. They wanted to destroy the field energy here.</p><p>After paying a price, the structure of the land of dusk had indeed been destroyed by the foreign races, and a safe path had been forcibly opened up.</p><p>The people in the small world were also paying close attention and sending people to inquire about the situation outside.</p><p>This was because it concerned their survival and safety.</p><p>If the land of dusk was completely conquered by the foreign races, their small world would probably be found by the foreign races as well.</p><p>Not long after, a shocking piece of news came.</p><p>The alien races fought deep into the land of dusk, but they were attacked by a terrifying force.</p><p>In the depths of the land of dusk, a terrifying creature had awakened and was attacking the alien races. A terrifying battle had begun.</p><p>That day, a thunderous roar came from the depths of the land of dusk, as if a giant beast had awakened.</p><p>In that battle, the alien race suffered a great loss. A large number of powerhouses died inside. It was said that a heavenly Emperor realm powerhouse was killed and fell inside.</p><p>The alien race retreated from the depths of the land of dusk in defeat.</p><p>Ren Chan, Lu Ming, and the rest were also extremely shocked when they heard that.</p><p>What exactly was in the depths of the land of dusk? Even a heavenly Emperor had fallen in there. It was too shocking.</p><p>I’m still not strong enough. 1 need to continue increasing my combat strength!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He condensed his body with his soul and entered his own small world. He went to the path-understanding ancient tree to comprehend the laws.</p><p>One did not need a physical body to comprehend the laws. One’s soul could still comprehend them.</p><p>Right now, his main focus was to comprehend the life law.</p><p>In the past two years, he had only broken through to the third level in one of his artifact Dao laws. He had also refined all the remaining chaos gems and raised his cultivation to the peak of a four star true Emperor.</p><p>As for the laws of life, he was also on the verge of breaking through.</p><p>This was because he was able to comprehend the indestructible ancient scroll, the life laws, and the laws of craftsmanship faster than the other laws.</p><p>The cultivation this time went very smoothly. His life law had already reached the limit of a breakthrough. A few days later, Lu Ming successfully broke through and his life law broke through to the third level.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming’s three ultimate maxims had all reached the third realm. In addition, the law of devouring, the law of craftsmanship, and the law of array Dao were all at the third realm.</p><p>Only the laws of alchemy, the laws of extremity, and the laws of penetration were still at the second realm.</p><p>In addition to Lu Ming’s peak four-star true Emperor cultivation base, his current combat strength had already reached the limit of a rank 17 true Emperor.</p><p>As long as he had one more law, or his cultivation broke through to become a five-star true Emperor, his battle prowess would reach level 18 true Emperor.</p><p>The fighting power of a rank 18 true Emperor was known as the fighting power of a peak true Emperor. Not everyone could reach that level.</p><p>It had a strict rule, which was to master an ultimate law and eight King path laws. One had to cultivate all of them to the third realm and reach the peak of Seven Star true Emperor.</p><p>Only such a person had the combat power of a rank 18 true Emperor.</p><p>On the other hand, those who had not mastered an ultimate Maxim would not have the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor even if they cultivated it to the peak. At most, they would only have the battle power of a rank 17 true Emperor.</p><p>Some of them could only reach rank 16 true Emperor at most.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming rarely encountered a rank 18 true Emperor. One of the reasons was that most of the rank 18 true emperors were in seclusion to break through to the great emperor realm. The other reason was that they were rare.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had yet to reach the peak of his cultivation and laws, but he was about to reach the combat power of a rank 18 true Emperor. If his cultivation and laws were both at the peak, his combat power would be unimaginably strong.</p><p>Of course, it didn’t mean that one couldn’t break through to the great emperor realm without reaching the fighting power of a rank 18 true Emperor. Many people who didn’t master an ultimate law could still break through to the great emperor realm if they had nine types of laws at the peak. They only needed one type of King path law.</p><p>That’s right. To break through to the great emperor realm, one had to master at least one king path law out of The Nine Laws. This was also why the king body had the potential to become a great emperor.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming ended his cultivation and pondered, there was a sudden tremor. It was as if the entire world was shaking.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire world was shaking more and more violently.</p><p>the small world is under attack. Gather, everyone, gather!</p><p>A voice spread to every corner.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. Could it be that the alien race had found this small world?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the huge city, countless figures rose into the air and gathered outside the city wall.</p><p>Lu Ming also flew over and saw Ren Chan and the rest.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was extremely ugly and heavy. They looked in the direction of the small world’s exit. The violent shaking was coming from that direction.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From that direction, beams of light flew over. They were the experts guarding the exit. At this moment, they were all panicking.</p><p>“The alien races are attacking!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned pale.</p><p>They thought of the rumors that wherever the alien race passed, they would leave no one alive.</p><p>“How is that possible? How could the alien races find the entrance to the small world?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>It had been so many years, and the alien races hadn’t been able to find the entrance to their small world. How did they find it now?</p><p>“No matter what, prepare to face the enemy!”</p><p>An old man with almost all his hair gone stood at the front and spoke. He was an elder of the small world.</p><p>There were a total of five elders in the small world, and they were all extremely powerful great emperors.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, deafening rumbles came from the front. It was as if thousands of soldiers and horses were marching in the air, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>Then, a mass of dark clouds rushed over.</p><p>It was not a dark cloud, but a foreign race.</p><p>Countless alien races rode on all kinds of beasts and roared as they charged over.</p><p>“The remnants of the heaven realm, kill, kill them all, leave no one alive!”</p><p>The alien races roared and the alien beasts roared. They waved their weapons and charged over.</p><p>“Let’s kill our way out, kill!”</p><p>An elder shouted. All the experts in this small world gathered and charged toward the alien race.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and the rest followed the crowd and charged out.</p><p>The two sides clashed.</p><p>The first to be hit were the great emperors from both sides. When they collided, terrifying shockwaves erupted as they fought fiercely..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
