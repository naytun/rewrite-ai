The cultivation resources in this small world were getting less and less, and it was difficult for strong cultivators to be born. If they were found by the alien races, they would be destroyed sooner or later.</p><p>The best plan was to go to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>In the ancient times, when the alien races invaded, not everyone retreated. Many didn’t have time to retreat and stayed in ten thousand spirit realm.</p><p>This small world was like this.</p><p>Unfortunately, they did not gain anything from Lu Ming. They only knew the current situation of the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming stayed there and cultivated in peace.</p><p>Every day, he would enter the mountain and river diagram to comprehend Dao and laws under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Now, the path-understanding ancient tree had grown to fifty meters tall, but its effect was much worse than a mature path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>But it was better than nothing.</p><p>However, after cultivating for a few months, Lu Ming did not make any breakthroughs in other laws. He was still at the peak of the second realm.</p><p>It wasn’t that easy to break through to the third realm.</p><p>During this period of time, Ren Chan would look for Lu Ming to spar with him from time to time.</p><p>In this small world, there was no doubt that Ren Chan was invincible among her peers. Now that Lu Ming had come, he was about the same age as her but his combat strength was far above hers. Naturally, she would often look for Lu Ming.</p><p>After a while, the two of them had become very familiar with each other.</p><p>On this day, Ren Chan came to look for Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re planning to head out to myriad Spirit Mountain to pick some spiritual and sacred herbs. Do you want to come along?”</p><p>Ren Chan said.</p><p>“Wan Ling mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>that’s right. Wan Ling mountain is the most famous mountain in the ten thousand spirit realm. There are countless spiritual herbs and Saint herbs growing in Wan Ling mountain, and it contains sacred land, which is very suitable for the growth of Saint herbs and spirit herbs!</p><p>the first goal of our trip is to bring back some spiritual and sacred herbs. The small world is in serious shortage of spiritual and sacred herbs. Many low-realm Warriors lack them for cultivation!</p><p>if the conditions allow it, we can dig up some sacred land from ten thousand Spirit Mountain. That would be the best. We can plant large amounts of spirit and sacred medicine!</p><p>Ren Chan explained.</p><p>“Alright, 1’11 go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Wan Ling mountain is different from other places. Although our spirit herbs and sacred medicine are not of much use to the foreign tribes, they don’t want us to get them either. Therefore, Wan Ling mountain is guarded by a large number of powerhouses, which makes it very dangerous. If you don’t want to go, 1 won’t force you!”</p><p>Ren Chan said.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming also wanted to go out and train. Otherwise, his cultivation progress would be slow.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had killed a large number of alien races in the true Emperor battlefield and obtained many black crystals unique to them. Over the past few months, Lu Ming had also taken some time to let the celestial Emperor’s body absorb a large number of crystals. The energy stored in the celestial Emperor’s body had once again reached about thirty percent. With the celestial Emperor’s body, he had much more energy to protect himself.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll be setting off soon, let’s go together!”</p><p>Ren Chan smiled and followed Lu Ming to a square.</p><p>There were already a few people gathered here.</p><p>This time, they were going to send out many experts, even five great emperors.</p><p>There was definitely a non-human Emperor guarding Wan Ling mountain. Without an Emperor, there was no way to get the spirit herbs.</p><p>“Almost everyone’s here, let’s go!”</p><p>An old man whose hair was about to fall out said. This person was an elder of the small world and was an expert even among great emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming understood. This small world was guarded by a heavenly Emperor. However, he had been in seclusion and did not come out. Therefore, the elders were the highest level.</p><p>This time, an elder was leading the team with five great emperor realm experts as support. The rest were all true emperors and there were more than a hundred of them.</p><p>This was already a very strong force.</p><p>They left the exit of the pocket World, carefully left the land of dusk, and headed in one direction.</p><p>Ten thousand Spirit Mountain was located in the center of the land of ten thousand forests. It was the most famous Holy Land in the land of ten thousand spirits.</p><p>It was said that the land of ten thousand spirits got its name from the ten thousand Spirit Mountain.</p><p>In the ancient times, before the foreign races invaded the land of ten thousand spirits, the land of ten thousand spirits was extremely prosperous. The strongest sect in the ten thousand spirit realm, the ten thousand spirit sect, guarded the ten thousand Spirit Mountain.</p><p>After that, the foreign tribes invaded, and the thousand spirit sect was destroyed. All the experts were killed, and the thousand Spirit Mountain was occupied by the foreign tribes.</p><p>They advanced very carefully, and along the way, they didn’t encounter any foreign races.</p><p>According to Ren Chan, the number of alien races in the ten thousand spirit heavenly region had suddenly decreased significantly in the past ten years.</p><p>That was why they dared to come out and obtain resources.</p><p>In the past, they wouldn’t have dared to set their eyes on Wan Ling mountain. As the number one Holy Land in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain, there were a large number of alien overlords stationed there.</p><p>However, in recent years, the number of alien races on Wan Ling mountain had decreased significantly, and most of them had retreated.</p><p>“Is it because of the attack on the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>There were two battlefields in the Tai Qing heavenly region, and they had both been attacked by the alien races in the past ten years.</p><p>Perhaps the alien races had transferred the powerful beings from other heavenly regions to the battlefield of the Tai Qing heavenly region, which was why the number of them had decreased.</p><p>This was very possible!</p><p>It took them more than half a month to get to Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>In front of them, there were many majestic mountains that reached into the clouds.</p><p>However, there was one mountain that was the most majestic. It was like a flock of cranes among the mountains.</p><p>That was Wan Ling mountain. The original Qi here was so dense that it had already turned into mist.</p><p>“Ren Chan, check it out!”</p><p>The doyen instructed.</p><p>Ren Chan nodded and began to investigate through the flowers and trees.</p><p>Not long after, Ren Chan finished his investigation and said,” four of them are extremely powerful. They should be great emperors!</p><p>“Four great emperors? good!”</p><p>The doyen revealed a look of joy and said,” wait a moment. We’ll attack and hold back the enemy’s great emperor. You guys take the opportunity to rush in and harvest the sacred medicine. It would be best if you can dig up some sacred land!</p><p>After the doyen gave his instructions, he looked at the other four great emperors and nodded silently before rushing out together.</p><p>Five great emperor realm experts rushed towards Wan Ling mountain. Their terrifying auras immediately alarmed the non-humans.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Four beams of light immediately shot out of Wan Ling mountain. They were all great emperors, and they fought intensely with the five founding elders.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! someone said. They rushed toward Wan Ling mountain at top speed.</p><p>When they got close to Wan Ling mountain, they split up into groups of a few.</p><p>They split up and entered Wan Ling mountain to pick spiritual and sacred herbs. Then, they would meet up outside.</p><p>Their main goal this time was to step on the spiritual and sacred herbs, not to fight with the other party.</p><p>More than 50 people were divided into more than a dozen groups and rushed toward Wan Ling mountain in different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and a few other people formed a team. They followed the forest and rushed towards Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, they heard violent rumbles from other directions. It was clear that someone had encountered an alien race and a great battle had broken out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
