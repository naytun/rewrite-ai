Those who violated it would be severely punished.</p><p>However, there would still be people who would take the risk and kill heaven realm beings on the battlefield to make a huge profit.</p><p>This kind of person usually disguised themselves. They had One Identity on the battlefield and another identity when they returned to two world city.</p><p>Of course, there was a huge risk in doing so. Once he was recognized, only death would await him.</p><p>Blood Blade hand was such a person. In addition to his strong combat strength, it was said that he had the combat strength of a level 14 true Emperor.</p><p>Just now, he was hunting the heaven realm’s experts and happened to run into Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, he had turned his attention to Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not retreat. His eyes were filled with an eager expression.</p><p>His fighting power had already reached the peak of level 11 true Emperor, only one step away from level 12.</p><p>With the indestructible ancient scroll, he could even kill a rank 12 true Emperor.</p><p>Therefore, he wanted to try and see how strong a rank 14 true Emperor was.</p><p>Even if he was no match for them, Lu Ming still had the fallen star bow and the celestial Thearch’s physical body. He would have no problem escaping.</p><p>The bloody swordsman was slightly surprised. He did not expect Lu Ming to not run away after hearing his name.</p><p>If he didn’t escape, he would die!</p><p>The bloody swordsman’s figure flashed and he charged at Lu Ming like a ray of blood light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In Lu Ming’s palm, the divine ability-infinite Dragon Spear appeared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming erupted with all his strength and stabbed the bloody swordsman with his spear.</p><p>The spear radiance howled and shattered the void. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first time using his full strength after he had broken through to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>rank 11 battle strength! He’s only a two-star true Emperor at such a young age, but he already has rank 11 battle strength. He’s a peerless genius!</p><p>Bloody blade artist was shocked at first, but his shock was soon replaced by greed.</p><p>At such a young age, he already had the battle power of a rank 11 true Emperor. This was simply terrifying. As far as he knew, in the entire heaven realm’s younger generation, only one or two people had reached this step.</p><p>Could the young man in front of him be one of the top two of the nine absolutes?</p><p>No matter what, this kind of genius was frighteningly rich.</p><p>The bloody swordsman’s eyes were burning as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The blood-red saber-light slashed at Lu Ming’s spear radiance. Lu Ming’s spear radiance trembled violently. The infinite Dragon Spear, which was formed by nine types of laws, trembled continuously as if it was about to be torn apart by the other party’s power.</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying saber Qi rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was sent flying. His body was covered in knife wounds and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a large mouthful of blood. He was severely injured in one move.</p><p>The difference between a rank 11 true Emperor and a rank 14 true Emperor was too great. They were no match for each other.</p><p>If it was an ordinary rank 11 true Emperor, he would have died from this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the indestructible ancient scroll and the indestructible golden body. His defense was amazing, and his recovery ability was even more terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s injuries were rapidly recovering. The knife wound was also healing rapidly.</p><p>“He didn’t die!”</p><p>Bloody blade hand was shocked.</p><p>A person with the battle power of a rank 11 true Emperor had taken his attack and was still alive. This was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Bloody blade hand’s eyes suddenly widened, revealing an extremely shocked expression.</p><p>He recalled the exchange of blows with Lu Ming earlier. He could sense that Lu Ming’s divine power contained nine types of laws, three of which were ultimate laws.</p><p>A person could actually master three ultimate maxims.</p><p>He had stayed in the battlefield of true emperors for decades and had never heard of Lu Ming’s name. Naturally, he was shocked when he thought of it.</p><p>However, after the shock, it was the blazing fire.</p><p>“Kid, hand over your cultivation method!”</p><p>The bloody swordsman’s eyes were filled with greed as he rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming had cultivated three ultimate maxims by relying on some ancient scripture. If he could get it, would he not be able to dominate the world?</p><p>He had to get it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s injuries had almost recovered. He held the long spear and charged at the bloody swordsman again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow. Lu Ming retreated rapidly and was seriously injured once again.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were exceptionally bright.</p><p>A life-and-death battle. This was a life-and-death battle. He could feel the aura of death with every move he made against blood Bladesman. However, this made him concentrate his spirit to the extreme, and every trace of strength in his body burst to the extreme.</p><p>His potential was also stimulated to the extreme!</p><p>He could feel that his usage of the laws was deepening.</p><p>“What kind of monster is this? his recovery ability is so shocking. Even the life law can’t have such a shocking recovery effect. I’m going to cripple this kid and search his soul!”</p><p>die! blood saber roared in his palm. He did not give Lu Ming the chance to recover and charged at him again.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear. This spear attack had reached its peak in history.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear clashed with the bloody swordsman’s bloody blade. However, the result was that Lu Ming was still forced to retreat. His body was covered in dense wounds.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming retreated, the bloody swordsman continued to attack. Before Lu Ming could recover, he was sent flying again, and his injuries worsened.</p><p>“Brat, no matter how strong your recovery ability is, you’ll still die!”</p><p>Bloody blade hand said maliciously.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. It was disadvantageous for him to continue fighting. Even if he had the indestructible ancient scroll, he would be killed by the other party.</p><p>Temporarily retreat!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A pair of transparent wings suddenly appeared behind Lu Ming’s back. With a flap, Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly, then he turned around and left.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The bloody swordsman was unwilling to give up and chased after Lu Ming frantically.</p><p>However, the six divine wings was a divine ability that he was proud of. It was so exquisite that once it was used, its speed was astonishing.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s cultivation level was relatively low, he was still faster than the blood swordsman when he cast it.</p><p>Lu Ming sped away, the distance between him and the bloody swordsman growing further and further.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>After chasing for a while, seeing that he couldn’t catch up, the bloody swordsman roared and stopped.</p><p>In the end, bloody blade artist had no choice but to turn around and leave.</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming stopped as well. The injuries on his body were recovering rapidly. He had already recovered by 30%.</p><p>This speed was simply too shocking. No wonder the indestructible ancient scroll was known as one of the most powerful ancient scrolls in the heaven realm. It wasn’t without reason. Its life-saving ability was simply too strong.</p><p>“This bloody swordsman is a rare training target. I can’t let him go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment, then retracted his aura. He spread his six-feathered divine wings and followed the bloody swordsman on the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming was very careful. He hid behind objects on the ground and completely concealed his aura. In addition, the bloody swordsman did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold as to follow him. Therefore, he did not notice Lu Ming at all.</p><p>After a while, the bloody swordsman arrived at a hidden cave and walked in.</p><p>Lu Ming found a place nearby, hid himself, and channeled his energy to heal his injuries.</p><p>His injuries recovered quickly, and soon, he was back to his peak..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
