They hoped that Lu Ming could defeat the alien race’s prodigy and restore the morale of the heaven realm.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor immediately ordered the formation to be opened and Lu Ming to leave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he flew out of two world city.</p><p>Instantly, it attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>“That is … Lu Ming!”</p><p>it’s him. It’s Lu Ming. Why is he out? is he going to fight with the alien race’s prodigy?”</p><p>before Lu Ming became a divine Emperor, he controlled many laws and even three ultimate laws. He defied the heavens and became a divine Emperor.</p><p>There has never been anyone like him in history.
