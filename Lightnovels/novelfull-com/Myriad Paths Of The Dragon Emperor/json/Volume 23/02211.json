He waved his hand and put Jian feiliu and Mu Lan into the small world. Then, a wave of energy swept up Lu Ming and dandan. In a flash, they appeared outside the castle.</p><p>Then, evil swordsman brought Lu Ming and the rest to Liu Hao and the rest.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered that when evil swordsman walked in this area, the marks of the unparalleled experts did not attack him.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that perhaps evil swordsman’s realm was high enough or he had some secret technique to avoid the Mark’s attack.</p><p>Upon seeing evil swordsman, Liu Hao and the others were shocked and saluted him respectfully.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately told her about the passageway.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Liu Hao and the others were also shocked when they heard this.</p><p>They understood that this was a major event that concerned the fate of the heavenly realm.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place immediately and send a message to the seniors in two world city!”</p><p>Liu Hao and the others agreed. They didn’t dare to waste any time and rushed out of the battlefield.</p><p>Evil swordsman led Lu Ming and dandan toward the passage.</p><p>Not long after, they approached the passage and hid in the high sky, watching from afar.</p><p>Many members of the evil god race were circling around a patch of void and were moving around. Rays of light were entering the void.</p><p>The evil god tribe also formed many giant hands, trying to tear the void apart and reopen the passageway.</p><p>these evil god tribe members are setting up a formation. They want to use the power of the formation to reopen the passageway!</p><p>Evil swordsman sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>“Senior, what should we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming also sent a voice transmission.</p><p>when the experts from two world city arrive, we’ll kill them all. Now, we can only fight it out with blood. There’s no other way. However, the other party’s heavenly Emperor realm experts don’t dare to come. At most, they’re at the peak of the great emperor realm. Although I’m still injured, I’m still confident in dealing with those at the great emperor realm!</p><p>Evil swordsman said, an ice-cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming’s heart felt more at ease.</p><p>Then, they waited quietly.</p><p>One day later!</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Evil swordsman suddenly said. In the distance, a few figures flickered and came over. They were very secretive. If it were not for evil swordsman’s reminder, Lu Ming and the others would not have noticed them.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s lips moved slightly, as if he was transmitting his voice. The next moment, those figures came toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>There were a total of three people, two old men and one middle-aged man. They were covered in blood and had obviously gone through a great battle.</p><p>Although the three of them had completely concealed their auras, Lu Ming could still sense that they were definitely terrifying experts.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>After the three of them arrived, they cupped their fists towards evil swordsman.</p><p>“Why are there only three of you? This is such a big matter, why didn’t the others come?”</p><p>Evil swordsman frowned.</p><p>“Al, the others won’t be able to come!”</p><p>An old man sighed. His hair was in a mess and his body was covered in blood. He had obviously gone through a bitter fight.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Evil swordsman asked.</p><p>Lu Ming and dan Xin were also on tenterhooks. They had a bad feeling.</p><p>a day ago, the evil god tribe suddenly sent out a large Army to attack the two world city and surrounded it. The two world city is still in a fierce battle, and most of the experts are being held back!</p><p>there were originally more than ten of us who broke out of the encirclement and came here to stop the evil god tribe from breaking open the passageway. However, we went through a battle on the way here, and after entering this battlefield, we were attacked by the marks of the experts. Out of the more than ten of us, only the three of us were left to come here!</p><p>After the old man finished speaking, he let out a long sigh.</p><p>The dozen or so people who had broken out of the encirclement were all experts. It was a pity that they had lost so many people in order to come here. It was definitely a huge loss.</p><p>However, in order to stop the evil god tribe, he had no other choice.</p><p>For example, the evil god tribe had sent a large number of experts into this place in order to open up this passageway. Their losses would definitely be shocking.</p><p>it seems like the evil god tribe is well prepared. They are afraid that the powerful cultivators of two world city will find out and come to stop them!</p><p>Evil swordsman’s cold light grew even more intense, there’s no other way now, ” he said, we can only kill our way over.</p><p>At this moment, a bright light shone from the tunnel ahead.</p><p>The evil god tribe seemed to have already set up the formation and were starting to activate it.</p><p>The endless light condensed into a huge spiral drill-like thing, facing the void. It seemed to be drilling a new passage where the original entrance was.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The space trembled and crumbled, revealing a dark cave.</p><p>“There’s no time to waste. Do it. You two, stay here!”</p><p>Evil swordsman glanced at Lu Ming and dandan. Then, with a flash, he rushed toward the many experts of the evil god tribe.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s speed was extremely shocking, and in just a few flashes, he was already close to the evil god tribe.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>There were too many experts from the evil god tribe. As soon as evil swordsman got close, the other party discovered him and shouted.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Evil swordsman made his move. A longsword appeared in his hand, and he slashed out. Sword light filled the sky, and a powerful evil god race member was directly split in half, his soul obliterated.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>That evil god was definitely a great emperor, but he was killed by evil swordsman in one strike.</p><p>Although evil swordsman had yet to recover from his serious injuries, his battle strength was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>this guy was much stronger than he is now at his peak. He is a peerless master in the heaven realm. Of course, compared to me, there is still some gap!</p><p>He spoke, but he didn’t forget to boast at the end.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Evil swordsman shouted, and a terrifying aura burst forth. The world was filled with an indescribable pressure.</p><p>Evil swordsman was wearing a gray robe and looked very old, but when he attacked, he had a kind of world-dominating temperament. His whole body was filled with evil Qi, and his sword light seemed to split the world.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Several experts of the evil god race were killed by evil swordsman in succession.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Evil swordsman shouted. A sword light slashed at the void, directly splitting it open. Countless runes appeared there, and then exploded one after another.</p><p>This was the great formation set up by the evil god race, and a section of it had been cut off by evil swordsman.</p><p>At the same time, the drill that was formed by the formation also exploded and disappeared.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The experts of the evil god race roared as their auras exploded forth, shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p>“So many great emperors!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>There were too many great emperors in the evil god tribe, and most of them were extremely terrifying. Their auras were far above that of the great emperors from the Heng family and the Emperor formless, whom Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>Many of them were definitely advanced great emperors, and some were even peak great emperors.</p><p>It was terrifying to have so many great emperors working together.</p><p>However, evil swordsman was even stronger. With an iron sword in his hand, he killed his way into the evil god tribe. Every time he slashed out, an expert would be killed.</p><p>One sword for one, blood splattered for thousands of miles.</p><p>The three experts from two world city also made their move.</p><p>The cultivation of these three people was extremely profound, and they had powerful combat strength. They were fighting against the evil god tribe..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
