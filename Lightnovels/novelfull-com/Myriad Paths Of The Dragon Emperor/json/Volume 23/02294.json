Some of them burrowed into the soil while others grew outside. They followed the five-colored soil and wrapped it up.</p><p>At this moment, the path-understanding ancient tree started to grow crazily. Its leaves stretched out, and its branches grew longer and thicker. The entire path-understanding ancient tree was growing at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was fifty meters tall. Soon, it grew to sixty meters, sixty-five meters, seventy meters …</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It was indeed a sacred land. The effect of nurturing plants was amazing.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the path-understanding ancient tree for decades and spent a lot of resources to grow it to fifty meters tall. However, it had grown to nearly fifty meters in just a short while.</p><p>The roots were growing crazily, as if they were going to wrap up all the five-colored soil.</p><p>After a while, the height of the path-understanding ancient tree had grown to an astonishing height of a hundred meters.</p><p>At this moment, there was a flash of light in the distance. An expert had arrived.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming hugged the path-understanding ancient tree and used the small world’s power to envelop the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was pulled up and it headed toward Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>The roots were like countless claws, grabbing onto the five-colored soil and moving towards the small world.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>About one-tenth of the five-colored soil on the entire thousand Spirit Mountain was taken by the path-understanding ancient tree into Lu Ming’s small world. There was an unknown amount of five-colored soil. There was too much of it. If they were to dig slowly, they did not know how long it would take.</p><p>“I’ve earned it this time!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He did not know how many herbs he could cultivate with so much five-colored soil. Furthermore, the path-understanding ancient tree did not need to purchase any spiritual liquid to water it anymore. With so much five-colored soil, it would be enough. Its growth speed would definitely be shocking.</p><p>“Human, die!”</p><p>From afar, a loud roar could be heard. Some alien races were rushing towards them. Lu Ming used his six-feathered wings and left the place in a flash.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming shook off the alien races and entered Wan Ling mountain. He picked spiritual herbs, sacred herbs, and Emperor’s herbs madly.</p><p>They had agreed that they would leave this place in two hours and meet up at the corresponding location.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to harvest and harvested at least thousands of medicinal herbs of various grades. At this moment, he ran into Ren Chan and the others, who were being chased by a few alien races. Lu Ming took out the fallen star bow and killed them.</p><p>Then, they continued to harvest the herbs. Soon, two hours were almost up. They could only give up and rush out of Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>With Ren Chan’s senses, they only encountered a wave of alien races along the way, but they avoided them. They flew all the way and soon came to a hidden mountain pass.</p><p>This was the place they had agreed to meet up at.</p><p>However, they were the first to arrive, and the others had not yet arrived.</p><p>“I wonder how the others are doing?”</p><p>Ren Chan was a little worried.</p><p>Not long after, a group of four people arrived. However, all of them were injured to varying degrees. As soon as they arrived, they began to circulate their internal energy to heal their injuries.</p><p>Not long after, more and more people came.</p><p>Half an hour later, only about 30 people arrived.</p><p>When they had arrived, there had been more than fifty people. But now, only about thirty people had returned. This made everyone’s expression turn ugly. Most of the people who didn’t come were already dead!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The void moved and five figures appeared. They were the doyens and the other four great emperors.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>The elder instructed.</p><p>“Grand Elder, where are the others? Should we wait a little longer?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“No need to wait, let’s go!”</p><p>The doyen sighed.</p><p>The others all revealed a trace of grief. From what the Grand Elder meant, the others were most likely dead.</p><p>They were helpless. Now that the alien tribes had occupied the entire myriad forest heavenly region, they were like turtles in a jar, hiding all day and facing danger at any time. They didn’t know when they would fall into the hands of the alien tribes.</p><p>It would be great if he could go to the Tai Qing heaven!</p><p>Some people sighed!</p><p>The news of the attack on thousand Spirit Mountain spread quickly. The alien races in the thousand spirit realm were shocked and they were hunting for Lu Ming and the rest everywhere.</p><p>Along the way, they were careful and avoided the alien races with the help of Ren Chan’s senses. They returned to the small world after more than ten days.</p><p>After returning to the small world, they would hand over the spirit herbs and five-colored soil they picked to the elders of the small world for them to distribute.</p><p>Lu Ming also handed in some.</p><p>However, Lu Ming only handed over a little bit of the five-colored soil. He handed over 80% of the spiritual herbs, sacred herbs, Emperor’s medicine, and the rest. He kept a few hundred for himself and planned to plant them in the small world.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you can keep your spirit herbs and sacred herbs for yourself!”</p><p>One of the elders smiled. After all, Lu Ming was not from this small world. They were already very grateful that he went on an adventure with them.</p><p>it’s fine. I don’t have much use for these spiritual herbs and sacred medicines. Elder, 1 want to collect some spiritual herb seeds or plant seeds!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll send it to you in two days!”</p><p>The elder said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to his residence. As soon as he entered, a body condensed in his small world with a single thought.</p><p>This was not Lu Ming’s actual body, but a body condensed from the power of the soul.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s own small world, he was a God who could control everything. This was because he was in control of the laws in this small world.</p><p>When the power of the soul was condensed in his own small world, it was no different from a physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and came to a plain.</p><p>The plain was vast, and the path-understanding ancient tree was rooted here. Under its roots was colorless soil.</p><p>In a dozen days, the path-understanding ancient tree had grown a lot taller. Of course, it did not grow as fast as when he had first obtained the five-colored soil. It had already stabilized.</p><p>However, the height of the path-understanding ancient tree had still reached two hundred meters.</p><p>The leaf was crystal clear and resplendent, and the aura of the great Dao lingered around it. It was much faster to comprehend the Dao here than outside.</p><p>Lu Ming dug out some colorless congealed soil from under the path-understanding ancient tree and placed it in other places. Then, he planted the remaining hundreds of sacred and spiritual herbs everywhere.</p><p>A newly-formed small world had no living beings or vegetation, and it needed to be added by itself.</p><p>At the great emperor realm, one could create living beings, but that would take a long time. Adding on one’s own was the fastest.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Three days later, the founding elders sent people to deliver all kinds of spirit herbs and plant seeds.</p><p>Lu Ming scattered these seeds all over the small world. After some time, these seeds would take root and sprout. The small world would then be full of vitality.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming began to cultivate..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
