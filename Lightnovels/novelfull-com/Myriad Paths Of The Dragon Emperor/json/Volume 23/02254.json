It was as fast as lightning and Lu Ming had no way of avoiding it.</p><p>“We’re finished!”</p><p>This was what everyone was thinking. They believed that Lu Ming was dead for sure. He would not be able to overcome the rare ninth heaven tribulation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>He wasn’t willing to die like this. He had already reached the last step. He had a feeling that as long as he survived this Heavenly Tribulation, he would become a monarch.</p><p>He was unwilling to give up now that things had come to this.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, the drop of ancestral dragon blood in Lu Ming’s heart suddenly let out a Dragon’s Roar.</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar seemed to have a magical power that shook Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart was extremely calm. He was in a wonderful state.</p><p>The state of life and death!</p><p>In this state, it was as if he had an epiphany. His comprehension of the laws increased rapidly.</p><p>life is all-encompassing and can accommodate everything!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>His understanding of the various laws had become even clearer.</p><p>Now, he had a feeling that there would be no conflict at all when he fused the chaos laws and the death laws together.</p><p>He could even merge the life law into it.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming could only barely merge the chaos law and the death law. Moreover, the two laws conflicted with each other and would stimulate an astonishing power, causing him to be injured.</p><p>As for fusing the life law into it, that was even more impossible.</p><p>This was not a simple and crude fusion. Instead, it was a fusion of a divine power Technique. It perfectly fused the mysteries of different nomological laws together to produce a shocking power.</p><p>This was extremely difficult. The difficulty of fusing three ultimate maxims was many times harder than fusing two.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming felt that he could do it.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s opinion, he seemed to have understood many things. However, to outsiders, it only took a moment.</p><p>The burly man in purple gold armor’s long spear was about to hit Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly pointed his finger.</p><p>Nine types of laws gathered at Lu Ming’s fingertips and formed a divine power. It turned into a Spear’s gleam and stabbed at the burly man in purple gold armor.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>A sharp, ear-piercing sound reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>The two spearheads collided, creating a shocking wave. However, the next moment, the burly man’s spear bent into an arc and flicked, sending the burly man flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar, his aura was imposing. He held a long spear in his hand, which was completely composed of Saint energy and laws, containing nine types of laws.</p><p>Among them, three of the strongest maxims clashed with each other. A truly terrifying force gushed out and tore open wounds on Lu Ming’s arm.</p><p>It was still difficult for Lu Ming to control the divine power formed by three ultimate maxims. He would hurt himself.</p><p>However, its power had skyrocketed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his spear and charged toward the burly man in purple-gold armor who was sent flying by him. His speed was shocking.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Before the burly man in purple-gold armor could react, Lu Ming’s spear had pierced through the space between his eyebrows. Then, the long spear trembled and the power of nine types of laws erupted. The burly man in purple-gold armor’s body exploded.</p><p>At this moment, the other two burly men in purple gold armor had already charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>the spear trembled and rapidly expanded, sweeping out and colliding with the two violet-gold armored men.</p><p>The air trembled, the force was wanton, and the Thunder was raging.</p><p>The two purple-and-golden-armored men were forced back.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, although he had taken a few steps back, he immediately stopped.</p><p>At the same time, his muscles were wriggling and healing his injuries. An arm was growing out quickly.</p><p>hahaha, he succeeded. This kid succeeded!</p><p>Dandan laughed out loud, extremely excited.</p><p>As for LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, and the others, they gritted their teeth and were extremely depressed.</p><p>He had thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure. He did not expect that at the critical moment, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase greatly and turn the tide of the battle.</p><p>The others also heaved a long sigh of relief. They felt extremely nervous, and some of their palms even broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>this kid’s talent is truly shocking. In danger, his potential was stimulated instead, and his control of laws improved a lot!</p><p>A heavenly Emperor sighed with admiration in his eyes, which caused many people to nod in agreement.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the two burly men in purple gold armor charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his spear and fought with the two of them. At the same time, he was healing his injuries rapidly.</p><p>No one else walked out of the palace in the Tribulation cloud.</p><p>Lu Ming had the upper hand in the battle against the two burly men in purple gold armor. His injuries healed quickly and his other arm had completely grown back.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming launched a counterattack. His attacks were like a rainbow.</p><p>The two burly men in purple-gold armor were no match for Lu Ming. After exchanging dozens of moves, they were blown up by Lu Ming.</p><p>annihilated. Lu Ming annihilated the living being that walked out of the Tribulation cloud. Did he survive the Great Tribulation?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the Tribulation clouds in the sky, but they all had different thoughts.</p><p>Most of them hoped that Lu Ming had already overcome the major tribulation and become an Emperor.</p><p>However, those who held grudges against Lu Ming, such as LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, Yuan Xin, and the LAN family’s celestial Thearch, as well as some young prodigies, regarded Lu Ming as a great enemy. Some were even jealous of him. They all hoped that the heavenly Tribulation had not ended and that Lu Ming would die under it.</p><p>However, they were destined to be disappointed.</p><p>The Tribulation clouds in the sky began to fade and dissipate quickly. In a flash, they had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The Tribulation clouds disappeared, and the sun shone on the earth again.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming has succeeded!”</p><p>Mu Lan and bubbles cried out in excitement.</p><p>this kid has succeeded. As expected of the person I’ve chosen!</p><p>Dandan also revealed a smile.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu laughed heartily.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief and were happy for Lu Ming.</p><p>Only LAN Yun and the others had unsightly expressions.</p><p>“Dammit, how is this possible? how did he succeed?”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others from the Heng Xing River roared in their hearts. They were extremely unwilling, but they were also a little frightened.</p><p>How powerful would Lu Ming be if he became an Emperor?</p><p>Could they still keep up with Lu Ming’s pace?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s dantian had undergone a tremendous change.</p><p>In his Saint heart, the world core condensed by nine types of nomological laws had completely taken shape. His Saint heart had also begun to fully evolve into a small world.</p><p>The Holy energy in Lu Ming’s body began to transform into World Energy.</p><p>The power of the world was stronger than the Saint energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exploded with a shocking aura. It was Emperor pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming had become an Emperor. He was no longer an Emperor-to-be but a true Martial Emperor.</p><p>At this moment, he was a one-star void Emperor!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The abundant Saint energy was constantly transforming into World Energy. Lu Ming’s aura was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s aura had reached the peak of a one-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>However, this was not the end..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
