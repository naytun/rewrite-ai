After being sent flying, it floated in the distance, and the light became even more dazzling.</p><p>“This is … The power of laws, and the Laws of Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The ray of light that contained the Laws of Chaos moved again. Like a flying sword, it crossed the void and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the power of law and was about to counterattack when he was shocked.</p><p>This was because other than this beam of light, there were other beams of light that were rushing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Each ray of light was like a sword light, extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless. The sword of death condensed in his hand and circulated the Holy power to the extreme, slashing nine times in an instant.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sword of death collided with the Nine Types of Light like battle swords. Sparks flew everywhere, and the sound of metal clashing could be heard.</p><p>The nine beams of light were sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>nine types of nomological laws, corresponding to my nomological laws!</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He could tell that the nine lights represented nine types of laws, which were exactly the same as the nine types of laws that Lu Ming controlled.</p><p>Nine beams of light floated in the distance, and the light grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the nine beams of light moved again. Their speed was even more shocking than before. They attacked Lu Ming from nine different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming was highly focused. He used all nine types of laws and surrounded himself. At the same time, the sword of death contained seven types of laws.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>First of all, there was a sword gleam that was aimed at Lu Ming from behind. It was a sword gleam formed by the penetrating law. Its speed was so fast that it was beyond human reaction.</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and slashed backward, blocking the sword light.</p><p>However, in other directions, the sword light formed by the laws had arrived. It was like a stream of light, and its speed was extremely fast.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his six-feathered divine wings and dodged with all his might. At the same time, he continued to slash out in the midst of death, sending out dense sword light that densely covered the surroundings.</p><p>Even so, the sword gleam formed by the law still missed and broke through Lu Ming’s defense, leaving a sword wound on his body. Blood flowed out, and half of Lu Ming’s body was numb.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly circulated the life law and finally sealed the wound. It also recovered quickly.</p><p>However, the attacks of the nomological sword lights were far from over. That was only the beginning.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Beams of light crisscrossed. Nine types of dazzling law lights continuously charged at Lu Ming. Their speed became faster and faster. They could even develop sword moves on their own, and their power was even more shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to block and Dodge, but he could not completely block it. There were many wounds on his body.</p><p>this won’t do. My attack is too scattered. 1 can’t block it completely like this. 1 have to spread out the laws!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred. Then, he had an idea. The nine types of laws that he controlled scattered and flew out separately. They turned into nine rays of light and flew toward the sword gleam formed by The Nine Laws.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was controlling nine types of laws at the same time and his speed was obviously much slower than his opponent. Not only did he fail to block the attack, but he also caused himself to be attacked by even more nomological sword gleams.</p><p>Lu Ming could only use the six-feathered divine wings to Dodge, but he was still cut by a few sword radiances and bled.</p><p>this method is correct. I’m too unfamiliar with controlling the laws, and I’m not familiar with it. Otherwise, I would definitely be able to block it!</p><p>Lu Ming dodged quickly while he continued to control the law to resist.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming could not block it at all. It was because he was too unfamiliar with the use of the law and it was difficult for him to keep up with the other party’s speed.</p><p>However, as time passed, Lu Ming became more and more skilled in the use of the law. He could finally catch up with the other party’s speed.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming had blocked most of the sword radiance.</p><p>After a month, Lu Ming would be able to block all the sword gleams.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his usage of the laws had greatly improved. His understanding of each law had also deepened.</p><p>To Lu Ming, there was no doubt about the benefits.</p><p>Now that he had cast the self-created hammer of chaos and sword of death, the power had increased greatly. Lu Ming estimated that he had finally reached the small success stage.</p><p>Moreover, it would be of great help to Lu Ming if he wanted to create new divine abilities in the future.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming was more familiar with the use of various laws and had a deeper understanding of each law. Naturally, he could combine new divine powers according to different laws.</p><p>However, at this moment, the laws that were attacking Lu Ming suddenly changed.</p><p>It was no longer a single sword light. Some laws turned into true dragons, some into phoenixes, some into Qilins, some into Golden-winged great Pengs</p><p>The nine types of laws transformed into nine different divine beasts. Moreover, they were all top-notch divine beasts that evolved into different attacks.</p><p>In this case, it was more difficult for Lu Ming to deal with it.</p><p>As this was a more advanced application of the law, Lu Ming could not keep up and could only take the beating passively.</p><p>Immediately, he began to get injured again.</p><p>Lu Ming began to try. He transformed the nine types of laws into different divine beasts to fight against the other party.</p><p>However, this process was extremely difficult, even more so than the previous ones.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give up. He knew that this was the only feasible method.</p><p>This time, it took even longer. Lu Ming finally succeeded after fighting against the nine types of laws for two months.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming transformed the nine types of laws into different divine beasts, fighting against the other party’s nine types of laws and killing each other.</p><p>It was difficult to determine the winner in a short time.</p><p>“I’ve finally made a breakthrough in my life laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>during this period of time, after constant resistance, his life law had finally broken through and reached the perfected first level.</p><p>The nine types of laws that he controlled had already reached the limits of the first realm. Moreover, he was able to use them with ease. Lu Ming felt that he could break through to the Martial Emperor realm at any time.</p><p>“This time, even if I don’t get the indestructible ancient scroll, I’ve already gained enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s smile grew wider.</p><p>His greatest gain this time was not the breakthrough in the life laws, but his stronger use of The Nine Laws and deeper understanding of the laws.</p><p>These were all hidden wealth. They could not be seen now, but they would be of great use in Lu Ming’s future cultivation process.</p><p>In the future, Lu Ming’s cultivation would have fewer detours and it would be of great help to him in creating his own divine power.</p><p>This was an invisible wealth!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the void around them began to shake. The godly beasts formed by The Nine Laws collapsed and disappeared one after another. The void also shattered like a mirror.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his head spinning. The next moment, he realized that he was back on the ancient road. His palm was still on the platform.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient road under Lu Ming’s feet began to change.</p><p>Originally, this ancient road had already reached its end. But now, it suddenly extended all the way to the front.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
