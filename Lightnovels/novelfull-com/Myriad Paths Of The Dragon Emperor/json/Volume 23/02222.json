Why did this guy say anything?</p><p>As expected, the Gu family members were furious. Even the elders were furious, and a terrifying aura emanated from their bodies.</p><p>“Nest, great emperor, this time it’s all because of this guy, dandan!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that two of them were exuding the aura of a great emperor.</p><p>“Hey, what are you guys doing? The Gu family is known as a gentleman’s family, and all of you claim to be gentlemen. So you also want to bully the weak and win with numbers?”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Hearing this, the eyes of the elders and middle-aged men of the Gu family flashed. They all concealed their auras, but the anger in their eyes could not be extinguished.</p><p>you have to be taught a lesson for insulting the ancestors of my Gu family. Otherwise, you really think that my Gu family is easy to bully. My Gu family will not bully the weak with our strength and win with numbers. Today, let me meet you!</p><p>A cold voice was heard, and then a young man stepped out.</p><p>This young man was wearing a Jade crown and a long robe. He had sword-like eyebrows and Starry Eyes. He was very handsome.</p><p>Seeing this young man walk out, the Gu family didn’t stop him. Instead, they looked confident, as if they had faith in this young man.</p><p>“Your cultivation level is too low. I’m not interested. Lu Ming, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Dandan waved her hand, showing no interest at all, which made the young man in white even angrier.</p><p>“I’m gu yingzhong, who can give me some pointers?”</p><p>The white-robed young man held back his anger and cupped his fists.</p><p>“This Gu family, each and every one of them is really gentlemanly!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought that he had heard dandan mention this lonely family on the way here.</p><p>In dandan’s words, the Gus were a group of wooden blocks with rigid brains, not knowing how to be flexible, and self-proclaimed gentlemen.</p><p>Now that he saw it, it was indeed so!</p><p>However, dandan had a good relationship with a few people from the lone family.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and cupped his fists.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Gu yingchong said. Then, the sound of a sword rang out. A long sword appeared in Gu yingchong’s hand. An extremely bright sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three-star illusionary Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell Gu yingchong’s cultivation level the moment he attacked.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. He was very direct as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>This palm did not use any laws. It was just the explosion of physical body and Saint power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on the other party’s sword gleam. The sword gleam trembled and howled. In the end, the sword gleam collapsed and Lu Ming was forced to retreat dozens of meters.</p><p>“What powerful physical strength. Are you an immemorial body cultivator? No, your power is Saint energy. You haven’t become a saint Emperor yet…”</p><p>At first, Gu Ying thought that Lu Ming was an immemorial body cultivator. But then, he realized that Lu Ming was using Saint energy.</p><p>Once one became a Saint Emperor, the Saint energy would be transformed into World Energy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still using Saint energy, which meant that he had not become a saint Emperor. This shocked Gu yingchong.</p><p>The other members of the Gu family were also shocked.</p><p>To be able to receive a heavy blow from Gu Ying even before becoming an Emperor, this strength was shocking enough.</p><p>One had to know that Gu yingzhong was the number one genius of the Gu family. He was a character that only appeared once every 100000 years.</p><p>“Use your full strength. Like this, you can’t win Against Me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He knew that Gu yingchong had not used his full strength. The attack just now was just a test.</p><p>you haven’t become a saint Emperor yet. Although your battle strength is amazing, you’re no match for me!</p><p>Gu Ying spoke again, full of confidence.</p><p>“You didn’t go all out in the battle, how do you know?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very confident.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, let’s fight!”</p><p>Gu yingzhong’s fighting spirit was revealed. His long sword trembled, and the sound of the sword was endless. The power of laws burst out, making Gu yingzhong’s sword Qi even more astonishing.</p><p>two types of laws. One is an ultimate law, and the other is a type of King path law!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The lone Shadow moved again. He became one with his sword and turned into a sword light, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and the sword of death condensed. At the same time, long rivers of laws appeared on his body.</p><p>This time, the Gu family members were really shocked.</p><p>“Heavens, what did 1 just see? Four types of laws, he has control over four types of laws!”</p><p>he hasn’t even become a saint Emperor yet. How can he control four types of nomological laws?”</p><p>it’s said that my Gu family has an ancestor who was extremely talented. Before he became a sovereign, he had also mastered many laws!</p><p>The Gu family’s crowd burst into heated discussions.</p><p>Gu yingzhong’s eyes also flickered, but his sword light did not stop and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved the sword of death and met the attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided, and a shocking collision erupted. Sword Qi raged, and many of the Gu family’s people retreated.</p><p>After the two of them collided, their bodies trembled and they retreated tens of meters. The difference was that Lu Ming retreated a shorter distance.</p><p>he’s at the second realm of the strongest laws. He’s not weaker than LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Gu yingchong’s two types of laws, the strongest of which had already entered the second realm, and his cultivation was at the three-star illusionary Emperor level. Without a doubt, he was a top-notch heaven’s favorite.</p><p>If it was before, Lu Ming’s sword of death only contained four types of laws and would not be a match for such a prodigy.</p><p>However, due to the condensation of the ancestral dragon blood, Lu Ming’s physical body was twice as strong as before. This also made his combat strength stronger.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had the upper hand by casting four types of laws.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The battle intent in Gu yingzhong’s eyes grew stronger, and his aura also grew stronger.</p><p>“Three types of laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered slightly. A third law appeared on the lone Shadow.</p><p>This was a King path law, and it seemed to have reached the second realm.</p><p>This was a heaven’s favorite who was stronger than LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light tore through the air and headed for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the sword of death and charged at the other party.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them kept clashing in the air. The sword Qi was overflowing, and the sound of the sword was thousands of miles away.</p><p>Fortunately, someone from the Gu family had acted and created a light screen to block the purple bamboo forest below. Otherwise, the purple bamboo forest within 10000 miles would have been destroyed by the sword Qi.</p><p>The two of them were extremely fast, and in the blink of an eye, they had exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The more he fought, the faster Lu Ming’s qi and blood circulated. A Dragon’s Roar was heard from his body and a layer of dragon scales appeared on the surface of his skin.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also stunned.</p><p>Back then, when his cultivation base was still weak, dragon scales had already appeared on the surface of his skin because of his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>However, as his cultivation level increased, he could control the bloodline of the nine Dragons at will. Dragon scales no longer appeared on his body. But now, when he circulated his body to the extreme, a layer of dragon scales appeared on the surface of his body.</p><p>perhaps this is related to the ancestral dragon blood!</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the ancestral dragon blood.</p><p>Previously, he had refined a portion of the ancestral dragon’s blood to allow his body to expand. Now that the battle was at its most intense, his blood Qi was surging and boiling, causing the Dragon scales to appear..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
