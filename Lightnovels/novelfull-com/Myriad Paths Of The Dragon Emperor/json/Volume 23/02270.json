Now, his combat strength had already surpassed Bai Tai’s. In addition to the indestructible ancient scroll’s abnormal recovery ability, his combat strength was already considered the top in the periphery of the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the rest were planning to return to two world city.</p><p>In the past two years, he had fought dozens of battles in the true Emperor battlefield. He was on edge every day and needed to go back to two world city to relax and recuperate.</p><p>The two of them concealed their auras and returned to two world city after a few days.</p><p>Lu Ming and Bai tai parted ways after they returned to two world city.</p><p>B0x𝔫oѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>“I’m going to exchange for resources!”</p><p>The first thing that Lu Ming wanted to do was to exchange for resources. After that, he would rest for two days before going to some cultivation Holy Lands to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the treasure exchange area. Not long after, he arrived at a magnificent Hall. He walked into the hall and came to a counter.</p><p>“Little brother, do you need any help?”</p><p>A burly man in his fifties looked at Lu Ming with a smile.</p><p>“Senior, I would like to use the alien race’s crystal cores to exchange for treasures!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What treasure do you want to exchange for?” The burly man asked.</p><p>“Chaos gem!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His goal was the stone of chaos.</p><p>The other treasures were of little use to him. Only the chaos Qi in the chaos gem could help him increase his cultivation and even sense the chaos laws.</p><p>“You want to exchange for chaos gems? Little brother, it’s not that easy to exchange for stones of chaos. You need a large number of alien race crystal cores. 1 have a list here that records the alien race crystal cores needed for various treasures. Take a look!”</p><p>The burly man handed Lu Ming a list.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses.</p><p>Inside was a dense list, recording the alien essence crystals needed to exchange for various treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored everything else and found the chaos gem. He was dumbfounded when he took a look.</p><p>“You need this much?”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless.</p><p>The number of alien crystal cores required to exchange for chaos stones was too high. Lu Ming estimated that the alien crystal cores he had obtained in the past two years could only be exchanged for three chaos stones.</p><p>One had to know that in the past two years, he had experienced dozens of battles and gained a lot. He had originally thought that he could exchange for at least ten chaos gems to break through to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Now, it seemed that he had thought too much.</p><p>However, thinking about it, it made sense. Chaos gems were consumables and couldn’t be regenerated. One used meant one less. As time passed, the number would decrease. It was normal for them to be expensive.</p><p>It was clear that the reward given to him by heavenly venerate six sages was already generous enough.</p><p>Three chaos gems were equivalent to two years ‘worth of gains from risking his life.</p><p>“Little brother, do you still want to exchange?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked with a smile.</p><p>“I’ll exchange!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>He definitely had to exchange for it. The chaos gem was of great use to him, so he would exchange for it no matter how expensive it was.</p><p>The middle-aged man was slightly surprised.</p><p>Initially, he thought that Lu Ming was very young. At such a young age, it was almost impossible to hunt enough alien race crystal cores to exchange for chaos stones.</p><p>Therefore, he gave Lu Ming the list so that Lu Ming would have an idea of what to do.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming still wanted to change. He knew that he had made an error in judgment.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and passed it to the burly man. “Senior, this is my alien crystal core. Take a look!”</p><p>The burly man took it and looked at it. The surprise on his face became even stronger. He then nodded and said, these crystal cores can be exchanged for three chaos gems!</p><p>With that, the burly man took out a storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took a look and saw that there were three chaos gems inside.</p><p>Lu Ming put it away in joy. He thanked her and left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not attempt to break through to the next realm immediately. After he returned to his residence, he rested for two days before heading to the small world at the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>In the two years of fighting in the battlefield of true emperors, Lu Ming had made great progress. He had made a breakthrough in six types of laws. Only the life law and the penetration law had not broken through to the second realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had a feeling that it would be soon!</p><p>He had already touched the threshold of a breakthrough. As long as he comprehended it a little more, he might be able to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to make use of the mature path-understanding ancient tree. After these two laws had a breakthrough, he would use the chaos gem to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the path-understanding ancient tree and started to meditate quietly.</p><p>As expected, the cultivation this time went very smoothly. It only took him two months to make a breakthrough in the life law and the penetration law, one after another, to reach the second realm. Lu Ming’s combat strength had soared again.</p><p>While Lu Ming was cultivating, someone was discussing something in a Hall of the LAN family.</p><p>“You’re saying that Lu Ming exchanged a large number of alien nuclei for three stones of chaos?”</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor, Lan Cheng, asked an old man.</p><p>that’s right. The people of the LAN family saw Lu Ming in the redemption main hall. After asking around, they found out that Lu Ming had indeed exchanged three stones of chaos with a large number of crystal cores!</p><p>An old man from the LAN family replied.</p><p>it seems that Lu Ming has entered the battlefield to hunt the alien races. In just two years, the crystal cores he has hunted can be exchanged for three chaos gems. We can’t let him live. Send someone to keep an eye on Lu Ming. We must know where he is going, understand? ”</p><p>Lan Cheng ordered.</p><p>The old man nodded in agreement.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not know about all this.</p><p>now, I’ll go back and break through to the next realm!</p><p>Under the path-understanding ancient tree, Lu Ming’s face broke into a smile. He left the place and returned to his residence. He entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a chaos stone and drew out three wisps of chaos Qi from it. He sucked in the chaos Qi into his mouth and began to refine it.</p><p>The last time, he had used a month to refine three chaos gems.</p><p>This time, he only used half a month to refine the three chaos gems and nine strands of chaos Qi.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s small world underwent a drastic change and began to expand. The power of the world became more and more powerful, surging violently in his meridians.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura also increased rapidly. It was two times stronger than before.</p><p>After a period of time, the aura on Lu Ming’s body calmed down and he retracted it into his body.</p><p>A seven-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming had finally broken through to a seven-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>This speed was absolutely shocking. If it were to spread, it would scare people to death.</p><p>It had only been two years since Lu Ming became an Emperor, but he had already reached the level of a seven-star illusionary Emperor. This speed was too terrifying.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming could improve so quickly was mainly because he had accumulated too much in the past. Once he broke through, he had already reached the four-star illusionary Emperor stage.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s nomological structure was very complete. All nine types of nomological laws had reached the second realm, which far exceeded his cultivation.</p><p>One should know that as long as three types of laws had reached the second realm, one would be able to break through to the true Emperor realm. Lu Ming’s laws had already far exceeded the requirements. His small world was extremely stable. That was why he could continuously refine energy into it to improve his cultivation.</p><p>“I still have some more world cores on hand. 1’11 continue refining them and see if I can use them to break through to the true Emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>In the battlefield of true emperors, he had obtained many world cores, all of which were from the foreign races.</p><p>On the battlefield, although he had refined some, it wasn’t much. The main reason was that on the battlefield, it wasn’t so safe for you to refine. Now was the perfect time to refine..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
