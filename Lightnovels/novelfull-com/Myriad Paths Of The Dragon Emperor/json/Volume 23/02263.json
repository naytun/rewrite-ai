Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed more than ten times in a row. The force of his fingers swept across the air. Each finger force contained three types of laws.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had also tried to create some new divine abilities.</p><p>For example, he could merge other nomological laws into the chaotic finger of tribulation or the chaotic divine palm to create a new divine power.</p><p>B0xùî´ùô§—µùëíùô°.com</p><p>Although it was not as powerful as the chaos hammer, the death Sword, the infinite Dragon Spear, and other magical powers, it was enough for normal use.</p><p>What Lu Ming was casting now was the upgraded version of the chaos apocalyptic finger. It had added other laws. This was not a simple fusion of laws. It was a magical power that had been developed after a wonderful intertwining.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The dozen evil god tribe members were unable to block it at all. Their eyebrows were pierced through, and they died on the spot.</p><p>No matter how strong or weak their cultivation was, they were all killed in seconds, including a seven-star void Emperor.</p><p>After killing more than ten members of the foreign tribe, Lu Ming waved his hand. The world Energy turned into a sharp blade and cut open the evil god tribe members ‚Äòbodies, digging out their crystal cores.</p><p>More than a dozen fist-sized crystal cores were emitting strange fluctuations, sparkling and shining.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. This was his first harvest. He took out an empty storage ring and stored the crystal core in it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and nodded at the square-faced man. He then turned around and left, disappearing from the place in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The square-faced man and the skinny old man were petrified and their eyes were wide open.</p><p>They only reacted after a long time.</p><p>what terrifying strength! With a cultivation base of fifth-level five-star, he killed more than a dozen evil god tribesmen in an instant. One of them was even a seven-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>and it looks like he didn‚Äôt use any effort at all. All of them were killed in seconds. This person is definitely a rare heaven‚Äôs favorite. His battle prowess is shocking!</p><p>The few people who ridiculed Lu Ming earlier were now in awe.</p><p>it seems that we‚Äôve been too complacent and thought that he was a hothead. He doesn‚Äôt have such strength. He deliberately released his aura to attract the alien races to kill him. Our talents have limited our imagination!</p><p>The square-faced man sighed.</p><p>The skinny old man‚Äôs face was red with shame.</p><p>Just now, he was the one who ridiculed Lu Ming the most, saying that Lu Ming was a hothead, overestimating his own ability, and that he was courting death.</p><p>Now, he realized that it was not the case at all. He was just short-sighted and narrow-minded.</p><p>let‚Äôs go back and continue the ambush. We don‚Äôt have that kind of strength!</p><p>The square-faced man laughed at himself and then left.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to release his aura like before. As expected, he attracted the attention of the alien races, but they were all killed by him.</p><p>However, after that, Lu Ming‚Äôs reputation had also spread on this battlefield.</p><p>Many people knew that a peerless genius had come from the heaven realm. His combat strength was amazing. For a moment, the alien races did not come out at all when they saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs trick had failed.</p><p>Lu Ming was very speechless.</p><p>It seemed like this move couldn‚Äôt be used for long. He could only rely on himself to find the evil god tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming headed toward the center of the illusionary Thearch battlefield.</p><p>In the center of the void Emperor battlefield, a group of top void emperors had gathered. The top void emperors from both sides were hunting each other.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs speed was very fast. There was no need for him to hide at all. He crossed the sky directly and flew rapidly towards the center of the battlefield. Not long after, he arrived at the core area of the illusionary Thearch battlefield.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming had just entered the core area when he heard deafening rumbles coming from the front. Beams of dazzling multicolored light shot up into the sky continuously. The scene was shocking.</p><p>There was a battle going on, and it was not just one.</p><p>Instead, there were many people fighting fiercely.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs eyes lit up. He took a step forward and flew in that direction.</p><p>At this moment, a fierce battle was taking place in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>A group of heaven realm experts was being attacked by a group of evil god tribe experts.</p><p>There were about twenty experts from the heaven realm, but there were about fifty experts from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Both sides were experts, both at the six-star void Emperor realm and above. In the void Emperor realm, both were top experts.</p><p>‚ÄúCharge, charge out!‚Äù</p><p>On the heaven realm‚Äôs side, there was a true dragon that had turned into a hundred meters long. It roared continuously, and its Dragon Horn constantly shot out lightning bolts, trying to rush out.</p><p>This true dragon was extremely powerful. It was a seven-star illusionary Emperor and had mastered five types of laws. It could be said that it was very powerful.</p><p>However, the other party also had an existence of the same level, blocking him.</p><p>At this time, there were more than 20 Masters from heaven realm, each of them bathed in blood, and some of them had already been seriously injured.</p><p>On the ground, there were corpses of both humans and divine beasts.</p><p>‚ÄúAll!‚Äù</p><p>arghh! a shrill cry rang out. On the side of the heaven realm, a giant elephant was split in half by an axe of an evil god race member and died on the spot, damn it! Charge! We must charge out!</p><p>The true dragon roared.</p><p>This time, they had fallen into a trap.</p><p>In this core region, the peak illusionary emperors from both sides were hunting each other. This time, the heaven realm had gathered dozens of peak illusionary emperors. They had originally wanted to make a big move and ambush the evil god tribe.</p><p>But they didn‚Äôt expect to be ambushed by the other side. The other side sent out even more strong people, and the heaven realm suffered heavy losses.</p><p>There were only about twenty of them left, and they tried their best to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>However, the enemy‚Äôs numbers were too many, at least twice their number. Even if they used all their strength, it would be difficult for them to charge out. ‚ÄúCharge out, whoever can charge out counts, we can‚Äôt all die Here!‚Äù</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>A human expert with shocking battle prowess that wasn‚Äôt weaker than the true dragon charged forward with all his might, but he was attacked by two experts of the same level. He was beaten until he spat out large mouthfuls of blood and was forced to retreat.</p><p>don‚Äôt even think about escaping. Today, all of you will be annihilated!</p><p>A burly member of the evil god race spoke coldly.</p><p>These evil god tribe members were all purple-scaled aristocrats of the evil god tribe, and their battle prowess was astonishing.</p><p>The experts of the heaven realm were in danger.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He was like a beam of light, flying over from the distance, alarming everyone.</p><p>‚ÄúThere is only one person from the heaven realm, and he is a five-star void Emperor!‚Äù</p><p>The evil god tribe‚Äôs powerhouses relaxed when they sensed Lu Ming‚Äôs cultivation base.</p><p>As for the heaven realm‚Äôs side, they all revealed looks of disappointment.</p><p>‚ÄúLittle brother, quickly go, leave this place!‚Äù</p><p>Someone shouted loudly. He did not want to see Lu Ming coming to his death.</p><p>‚ÄúSince you‚Äôve come, don‚Äôt even think about leaving. I‚Äôll send him on his way!‚Äù</p><p>An evil god tribe member who was equivalent to a six-star illusionary Emperor wielded a battle axe and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He swung his axe at Lu Ming.</p><p>A combat sword was formed in Lu Ming‚Äôs hand.</p><p>Divine power-Death Sword!</p><p>However, it was only made up of seven types of laws. Lu Ming did not add the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming‚Äôs current cultivation level, the power that he could unleash was shocking.</p><p>A beam of sword light slashed out and destroyed the evil god tribe member‚Äôs attack. His body, along with his battle axe, was split into two by Lu Ming. At the same time, Lu Ming controlled the world Energy to sweep up the evil god tribe member‚Äôs crystal core..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
