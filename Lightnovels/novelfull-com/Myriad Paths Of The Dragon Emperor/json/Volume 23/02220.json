They were shining with boundless light and suppressing power. They kept pressing down on the blood sea.</p><p>In the blood sea, the giant face kept changing. It turned into the faces of all kinds of living beings. At the same time, they kept roaring, as if they were very unwilling.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The true dragon formed by the drop of blood roared and seemed to be suppressing the third bloodline together with the prison suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Gradually, the waves of blood in the third bloodline became smaller and the killing intent faded. Finally, it turned back into the form of a drop of blood and hid in Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>Following that, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline’s glow disappeared and it flew into Lu Ming’s spine and disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body stopped trembling. The blood Qi in his body had disappeared.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The true dragon formed by the drop of blood let out a loud roar before it transformed back into a drop of blood and rushed into Lu Ming’s heart. Following that, the drop of blood turned into tiny blood threads that swam through Lu Ming’s blood vessels and seeped into his muscles and bones.</p><p>Kachacha!</p><p>Lu Ming’s muscles began to wriggle, and his bones and bones shook. Thunder and the roar of a Dragon could be heard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body was being tempered and it was constantly improving. “So good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He could feel that his physical body was becoming stronger rapidly. He could clearly feel the speed at which he was becoming stronger.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming felt that his physical body had doubled in strength and the drop of blood had become smaller. It was only a little, about one percent smaller.</p><p>At this moment, the drop of blood no longer emitted blood threads. It calmed down and seemed to have fused with the heart.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, he felt sticky all over. It was the impurities discharged from the depths of his body.</p><p>With a thought, a flame spread out from his body, burning away these impurities.</p><p>the strength of my physical body has doubled. My combat strength has also increased by a large margin!</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Then, he saw a fair and tender face enlarging in front of his eyes. The face scrutinized Lu Ming, left and right. “Dandan, What are you looking at?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Kid, you have a lot of secrets!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes darted around, becoming more and more curious.</p><p>right, let me ask you something. What blood is this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming focused his mind on his heart. With a thought, the drop of blood appeared on his fingertip. A true dragon could be seen swimming inside.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were wide open, staring at the drop of blood.</p><p>could this be the blood of the injured true dragon? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“F * ck, let me tell you, that true dragon wasn’t a true dragon, it was formed from this drop of blood!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The true dragon that had fought against the evil god tribe’s old ancestor in the ancient battlefield was actually formed from this drop of blood. It was just a drop of blood, but it actually had such shocking power?</p><p>“Are you surprised? Let me tell you, this isn’t essence blood, it’s just a drop of blood. If I’m not wrong, this should be a drop of ordinary blood from the ancestral Dragon!”</p><p>Dandan said, her eyes still staring at the drop of blood. Slowly, they became fiery and revealed a greedy look, as if she wanted to swallow the drop of blood in one gulp.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly kept the drop of blood and kept it in his heart.</p><p>ancestral Dragon? what’s an ancestral Dragon? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious because he had never heard of this name.</p><p>ancestral Dragon, that’s a legend. It’s said that he’s the oldest true dragon in the world, the ancestor of all Dragons, the first true dragon in the Tian Yuan world!</p><p>Dandan said slowly, her eyes seemed to show a trace of respect.</p><p>“The ancestor of all Dragons, the first true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also shocked. This was incredible.</p><p>could it be that the ancestral Dragon is stronger than the nine Dragons? ”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“Nonsense, what are Nine Dragons? The nine Dragons are just a mutation of the real Dragon. They are more talented than ordinary real Dragons, which is why they have such achievements. However, they are nothing compared to the ancestral Dragon. Legend has it that the ancestral Dragon is a truly invincible existence, above the heavenly Dao. In other words, even the heavenly Dao has to submit to him!”</p><p>“This … How was this possible? The celestial Thearch controls the heavenly Dao, which is the pinnacle of martial Dao. He’s on equal footing with the heavenly Dao, so how can there be any living being that can transcend the heavenly Dao?”</p><p>Lu Ming widened his eyes in disbelief.</p><p>In his knowledge, the celestial Emperor was the limit. He was on the same level as the heavenly Dao, had no Heavenly Tribulation, was immortal, and lived as long as the heaven and earth.</p><p>However, there was actually a living being that could transcend above the heavenly Dao. This really broke his understanding.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming looked at dandan and asked suspiciously,” “Are you bragging again?”</p><p>who’s tricking you? let me tell you, I was lucky enough to see the ancestral Dragon once, so I’m very familiar with his aura. I’ll never forget it for the rest of my life. The drop of blood you got was a drop of the ancestral dragon’s blood. I guess it was left by the ancestral Dragon to suppress that passageway! Dandan said.</p><p>no way. Does that mean the ancestral Dragon has an enemy? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>The ancestral dragon left a drop of blood to suppress the passage. Obviously, the ancestral Dragon was from the heaven realm.</p><p>However, he only left a drop of blood and his real body was not there. This meant that the ancestral Dragon had an enemy.</p><p>If it was really as dandan said, that the ancestral Dragon was that powerful, then the situation was really serious.</p><p>Could it be that there were such terrifying existences on the side of the alien race?</p><p>Dandan also frowned, and her face was rare to see. She said,” obviously, there are also existences at that level in the alien tribes. Otherwise, the heaven realm wouldn’t have fallen to this point. Once the ancestral Dragon appears, even the celestial Emperor can’t defeat him. Unfortunately, I’ve never seen an existence at that level!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. The war between the two worlds was more tragic than he had imagined. With his cultivation, he could not interfere at all. The difference was too great.</p><p>ancestral dragon blood? ” he asked, why would the blood of the ancestral Dragon appear on me? is it related to the blood essence of the nine Dragons? ” “It’s most likely the case. Kid, you are really blessed. Even 1 am envious of you. Although this drop of blood is only an ordinary drop of blood of the ancestor Dragon and it has been consumed in the previous battle, it is still extraordinary. If you can refine it, the benefits will be amazing. I am so jealous of you. What virtue do you have?”</p><p>At the end of her sentence, dandan’s eyes turned red. She was really jealous.</p><p>He paced around Lu Ming, wishing he could bite Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his scalp turning numb. He chided,” “What are you looking at? get lost. By the way, how many days have we been back?”</p><p>“It’s already been ten days!” Dandan licked her lips.</p><p>“Ten days? That’s fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He felt that only a short while had passed. He did not expect that it would be ten days.</p><p>“I wonder how senior evil swordsman is doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of evil swordsman, Jian feiliu, Mu Lan, and a few others. He walked out of the courtyard and headed to another one..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
