No, I won’t let you die. I will extract your souls and make you suffer!”</p><p>One of the evil god race’s old ancestors spoke coldly.</p><p>They were truly furious!</p><p>After much difficulty, they finally found a passage to the primordial realm. As long as they took down this passage, they could send an Army into the primordial realm. In that case, it would be much easier to attack the taiqing heaven region.</p><p>But now, it was all ruined.</p><p>Even though the passageway was a connate passageway, it would still reveal itself and return to its original state with the passage of time. However, it would definitely take a long time.</p><p>The most important thing was that they, the old ancestor-level figures, had personally made a move, but their plan had actually been ruined by a few juniors. It was really embarrassing.</p><p>Their killing intent was naturally heavy.</p><p>They kept closing the distance between them and Lu Ming. This made dandan’s face pale.</p><p>On the other hand, evil swordsman was very calm. He enveloped Lu Ming and the others with his own energy and flew at top speed.</p><p>Suddenly, the flying evil swordsman stopped.</p><p>“Hey, why aren’t you running anymore?”</p><p>Dandan’s face turned even paler.</p><p>“Wait for them!”</p><p>Evil swordsman said indifferently, and the others were confused.</p><p>The two evil god race’s old ancestors were also stunned, and doubt flashed through their eyes. They didn’t understand why evil swordsman suddenly stopped.</p><p>But they didn’t stop and continued to chase.</p><p>When they were about to approach Lu Ming and the rest, the sky suddenly shone with a dazzling radiance. Figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>Among these figures, there were humans and divine beasts, such as huge and towering divine foxes, great ROCs with wings that could cover the sky, and Qilins covered in scales.</p><p>There were more than a dozen figures.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill all the outsiders!”</p><p>These figures were filled with killing intent. They looked at the two old masters of the evil god race and charged towards them.</p><p>Lu Ming, dandan, and the rest were dumbfounded.</p><p>Obviously, these figures were the immortal imprints left by the peerless powerhouses who died in the ancient times in the heaven realm.</p><p>He just didn’t expect that there would be more than a dozen here.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s eyes dimmed, as if reminiscing. He sighed,” back then, more than a dozen powerhouses died in battle. It was extremely tragic. These powerhouses were unwilling to die, so before they died, they left behind an immortal imprint!</p><p>Everyone was stunned and then sighed.</p><p>How many powerhouses were buried in the land under their feet!</p><p>No wonder evil swordsman would run here. He knew that the imprints of more than a dozen experts were gathered here.</p><p>if the two evil god tribe patriarchs were still in their full form, these powerful seals would have been completely useless to them. In fact, they wouldn’t even have revealed themselves. However, the other party is now heavily injured. Previously, he had disregarded his injuries and unleashed his full strength, causing his injuries to worsen and his combat strength to be greatly reduced. These seals will be of great use to them!</p><p>Evil sword guest said.</p><p>That was indeed the case. At this moment, the two evil god race’s old ancestors were being attacked by more than ten marks of experts. For the time being, they were unable to charge out at all.</p><p>Although these marks were not as powerful as when they were alive, they were still very powerful. With more than a dozen of them working together, they completely surrounded the two evil god race’s old ancestors, making it impossible for them to break out.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll go to two world city!”</p><p>Evil swordsman said. He led Lu Ming and the others toward two world city in a flash.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s speed was astonishing, and he seemed to avoid the marks of the experts here, quickly leaving this ancient battlefield.</p><p>As soon as they left the ancient battlefield, they arrived at an even more vast area.</p><p>This area was also a battlefield. There were potholes everywhere, and bones could be seen everywhere.</p><p>The two realms had been fighting on this battlefield for countless years. Countless living beings had fallen on this battlefield.</p><p>After arriving here, evil swordsman’s speed became even faster. In an instant, he had traveled ten thousand miles, and soon, a huge city appeared in front of him.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Although Lu Ming had seen many majestic ancient cities, he still gasped when he saw this huge city.</p><p>The city walls were made of all kinds of extremely hard metals, and there were countless runes flowing on them.</p><p>The city wall was shockingly high, towering into the clouds. At a glance, it was at least a hundred thousand feet high. One could vaguely see soldiers walking on the city wall.</p><p>The width of the city wall was even more shocking.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s eyesight, he could not see the end of both sides.</p><p>The two world city was called the two world city because it separated the two worlds.</p><p>The two world city completely separated the Tai Qing heavenly region from the Hunyuan heavenly region and blocked the entrance to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>One could only imagine how wide it was.</p><p>A light shield covered the outside of the city wall. It was a protective shield formed by the formation.</p><p>The two world city was the reason why the Tai Qing heavenly region had not been invaded by the foreign tribes for so many years.</p><p>it seems like the outsiders have already retreated!</p><p>One of the three powerful cultivators from two world city, an old man, spoke. His name was song Tianlong.</p><p>Previously, there had been countless alien races attacking two world city. Perhaps they had already received news of the ancient battlefield and retreated.</p><p>They flew up to the same height as the city wall. The soldiers on the city wall could already see them.</p><p>“I’m song Tianlong. Open the array and let us in!”</p><p>Song Tianlong said.</p><p>“It’s Lord song Tianlong! Open the array!”</p><p>A voice came from inside the city wall. Soon, the light shield outside the city wall squirmed and a door that could only allow one person to pass through appeared.</p><p>Everyone walked in separately.</p><p>“It’s so spectacular!”</p><p>After entering two world city, he stood high in the sky and looked into the distance.</p><p>Inside the city walls of two world city was a vast military camp. There were all kinds of ancient buildings that soared into the sky, and countless people were flying around.</p><p>It was too spectacular!</p><p>“Previously, everyone was injured, so I will arrange your accommodation. Follow me!”</p><p>Song Tianlong said. Everyone followed him and flew into the distance.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a huge Palace. Song Tianlong quickly arranged a place for them to stay.</p><p>In a courtyard!</p><p>“Dandan, protect me first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to dandan. He then sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Previously, when the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew into his glabella, nine drops of Nine Dragons ‘blood essence scattered all over his body. In addition, there was another drop of blood that also flew into his body. Lu Ming did not have the time to observe it.</p><p>First, Lu Ming checked his body.</p><p>Previously, when the nine drops of nine dragon blood essence flew out, he felt a sense of emptiness and the strength of his physical body weakened greatly.</p><p>But now, not only had his physical strength completely recovered, but he was also full of energy. Some of the injuries he had suffered before had also completely healed.</p><p>At the same time, he could feel that his physical body was much stronger than before.</p><p>“This … Could it be that when the blood essence of the nine Dragons flew into the divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, it brought out some power, so my body transformed again and became stronger?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
