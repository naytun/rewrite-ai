Now, it seemed that it had not.</p><p>This true dragon was entangled with the evil god race’s old master, preventing him from coming over.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron with all his might, causing the nine Dragons to bombard the space continuously.</p><p>The space kept exploding.</p><p>“This … Don’t tell me this is the ancestral Dragon …”</p><p>At this moment, dandan looked at the huge true dragon in the sky, dumbfounded and shocked.</p><p>“Ancestral Dragon? What was it? A senior?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>it was rare to see something that could make dandan so shocked. Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>that’s not right. It’s not the ancestor Dragon. If it was really him, he could have killed this evil god tribe member with just a breath. No, it’s just a wisp of his aura!</p><p>Dandan seemed to have not heard Lu Ming’s words. She was mumbling to herself, still looking like a fool.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. How was it possible that he could kill the evil god tribe member in front of him with just a breath?</p><p>This evil god race was a peerless expert. A heavenly Emperor above the four-star level, even a peak heavenly Emperor, would not be able to kill him with just a breath.</p><p>However, a peak heavenly Emperor was already standing at the highest point in this world.</p><p>According to Lu Ming’s understanding, the celestial Thearch was the limit of cultivation in this world. He was truly invincible at rhe peak.</p><p>Could there be a stronger existence than a peak heavenly Emperor?</p><p>Lu Ming thought that dandan was bragging. He did not think too much about it. He controlled the nine Dragons with all his might and bombarded the void continuously.</p><p>it was like kneading dough.</p><p>If you don’t knead a dough, there will be many cracks. The dough is not completely fused together. If you follow the cracks, you can separate the whole dough.</p><p>However, after continuous kneading and slapping, the dough would melt into one, and the cracks would disappear.</p><p>Now, this void, this passageway, was like this.</p><p>It was like a dough that had not been kneaded. There were still cracks, and the evil god tribe could open up the tunnel completely by following these cracks.</p><p>Lu Ming s current bombardment was to knead the dough, to completely integrate these spaces into one and the cracks would disappear.</p><p>Of course, this required a shocking amount of power.</p><p>Even ordinary heavenly emperors would find it difficult to do so.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s nine drops of Nine Dragons Blood essence flew our and manifested Nine Dragons. Only then did he have such power to completely collapse the passageway and the crack disappeared.</p><p>The evil god tribe s patriarch naturally knew what Lu Ming and the others were planning.</p><p>However, one of them was blocked by the huge true dragon and it was difficult to get rid of the other.</p><p>“You guys, don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor who was fighting against evil swordsman roared in anger. The light on his body brightened, and at this moment, he no longer cared about his injuries. He risked worsening his injuries and erupted with all his power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Evil swordsman was sent flying by his one move.</p><p>However, evil swordsman didn’t retreat. He once again charged at his opponent.</p><p>He needed to give Lu Ming enough time.</p><p>However, evil swordsman’s injuries were too severe. He had almost died in the ancient battle, and even now, his strength was far from fully recovered. When the evil god race’s old ancestor unleashed his full power, he was no match for him at all and was sent flying again.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was anxious as he tried his best to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Not only did the nine Dragons attack the void, but the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron itself also shone brightly and blasted toward the void.</p><p>The space was constantly exploding, then healing, and then exploding.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry!”</p><p>Lu Ming was anxious because evil swordsman could not hold on any longer. If this went on, evil swordsman would definitely die.</p><p>Once evil swordsman died, Mu Lan and Ji an feiliu in his small world would also die.</p><p>Lu Ming had to seize the time.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons let out a long roar, and their entire bodies burst out with dazzling light. Beams of light burst out from the bodies of the nine Dragons, which were extremely dazzling.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the bodies of the nine Dragons exploded.</p><p>This explosion formed a terrifying energy. The entire area and space were completely annihilated, turning into nothingness and chaos.</p><p>“No!11</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor bellowed.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>Evil swordsman laughed loudly. He no longer tried to stop them. Instead, his figure flashed and he rushed towards the three experts of two world city. A force swept them up and they flew into the distance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s enough. Let’s go!”</p><p>Evil swordsman s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and flew toward evil swordsman at top speed. They met up and flew in one direction at top speed.</p><p>The two evil god race’s old masters joined forces and charged towards the true dragon. However, the true dragon was no match for them. Its huge body started to break apart. The entire body of the Dragon exploded and turned into a drop of blood. In a flash, it disappeared from the place.</p><p>“A drop of blood!”</p><p>The two evil god race’s old masters were shocked, and their gazes turned grave.</p><p>Then, they came to rhe original passage. The void was healing quickly.</p><p>After it was healed, there was no space at all. It was exactly the same as the space in the other regions.</p><p>The passageway had completely collapsed.</p><p>“Damn it, kill those ants!”</p><p>The purple-haired old ancestor of the evil god race roared in anger and chased after Lu Ming, evil swordsman, and the others.</p><p>The other old ancestor of the evil god race and the other members of the evil god race all chased after evil swordsman and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and flew at high speed with evil swordsman.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming felt weak.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook and suddenly shrank rapidly. Lu Ming and dandan flew out of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron automatically.</p><p>Then, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron split into nine parts and flew into the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>At the same time, nine drops of blood essence flew out of the nine divine cauldrons and scattered into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, there was a flash of red light in the distance. A drop of blood pierced through the void and flew into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He did not understand what was going on.</p><p>However, at this moment, he felt weak.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Evil swordsman waved a wave of energy, sweeping up Lu Ming and dandan and flying forward.</p><p>However, evil swordsman was already heavily injured, and he had been injured even more when he tried to stop an evil god race ancestor. Although he was fast, there was a limit to his speed.</p><p>Behind him, two figures were chasing after him at an astonishing speed.</p><p>It was two of the evil god race’s old ancestors.</p><p>“We re finished, we re finished!”</p><p>Dandan wailed.</p><p>Right now, evil swordsman was heavily injured, and it was obvious that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s energy had been exhausted. How was he going to deal with the two old ancestors of the evil god tribe?</p><p>“You turtle, you’re really afraid of death. You’re no different from back then!”</p><p>Evil swordsman indifferently glanced at dandan and said disdainfully.</p><p>“What did you just say? Show me some respect, you’re my junior, do you understand?”</p><p>Dandan was displeased, and she glared at evil swordsman with wide eyes.</p><p>“Oh? Was it? Then 1 can only leave you here first. Perhaps you can delay the other party a little!”</p><p>Evil swordsman said indifferently.</p><p>Dandan immediately wilted.</p><p>He squeezed out a smile and looked at evil swordsman with a ‘gentle’ expression, saying,” don’t be like that. 1 was just joking with you. We re all old acquaintances. Calm down, calm down, hahaha!</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming was full of disdain!</p><p>The three experts from two world city were also disdainful!</p><p>This change in attitude was faster than flipping a book..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
