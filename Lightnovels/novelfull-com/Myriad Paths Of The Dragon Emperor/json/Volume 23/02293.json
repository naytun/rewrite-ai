Therefore, they had avoided the evil god tribe perfectly.</p><p>Not long after, they successfully entered the depths of Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>Here, the origin Qi was extremely rich, and the grass was as green as a blanket. Spirit herbs and Saint herbs could be seen from time to time.</p><p>“Quickly pick them!”</p><p>come on! Ren Chan shouted. The few of them moved and picked all the spiritual and Saint herbs in a flash, not letting a single one go.</p><p>There were too many spirit herbs and Saint herbs here, and the medicinal fragrance was so strong that it couldn’t be dispersed. There were spirit herbs and Saint herbs every few steps.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming saw a herb that was crystal clear and shimmering. Its medicinal fragrance was much stronger than other spirit herbs and sacred herbs.</p><p>“This is an Emperor’s medicine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He didn’t expect to see the emperor’s medicine before he even reached the main peak of Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>Spiritual medicine was very useful for those below the martial Saint realm.</p><p>As for the emperor’s medicine, as its name suggested, it was for martial emperors.</p><p>In fact, the path-understanding ancient tree was also a kind of Emperor’s medicine, a top Emperor’s medicine.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and condensed the world Energy into a shovel. He dug out the emperor’s medicine and kept it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Their speed was shocking. Wherever they went, all the spirit herbs, Saint herbs, and Emperor herbs were dug up.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity. It was rare for the number of alien races to decrease. If the number of alien races increased in the future, there would be no such opportunity.</p><p>Therefore, he naturally had to take the opportunity to dig up more medicinal herbs.</p><p>In just a short while, Lu Ming had dug up hundreds of medicinal herbs of different levels.</p><p>He had even dug up three Emperor’s medicine.</p><p>At this moment, the three of them had arrived at the real Wan Ling mountain, there’s sacred land in Wan Ling mountain. That’s the most precious. Let’s dig! The eyes of Ren Chan and the others lit up. The power of the world turned into hoes and they dug into the ground.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Hard Rock was broken, and soon, they lifted the rock on the surface of Wan Ling mountain. Suddenly, a five-colored light filled the air.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened.</p><p>There was a type of soil under the rocks of Wan Ling mountain. It was a soil with five colors.</p><p>This kind of soil was like mud. It was not hard and looked very soft. It could even flow.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Ren Chan and the others condensed the power of the world into large hands and grabbed at the five-colored soil. However, they could only grab a small piece each time.</p><p>“It’s so troublesome, can’t you just take it away?”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring, wanting to take away the entire myriad Spirit Mountain. However, it was of no use.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming wanted to put the five-colored soil in but it was useless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s useless. This kind of sacred land can’t be taken away at all. It’s useless even if we use the small world. We can only dig it out bit by bit!”</p><p>Ren Chan informed.</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless.</p><p>Following that, he condensed a huge hand with the power of the world and grabbed down.</p><p>However, the five-colored soil seemed to be a single entity and was extremely viscous. He couldn’t grab it at all. Every time, he could only grab a little bit. Compared to the huge Wan Ling mountain, it was only a drop in the ocean.</p><p>this is too slow. Even if we dig for a few days, we won’t be able to dig up much five-colored soil. 1 wonder if it’ll work if we use the path-understanding ancient tree?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, his eyes lit up.</p><p>This five-colored soil had a shockingly strong spiritual nature. All the spirit herbs, Saint herbs, and Emperor herbs near the myriad Spirit Mountain were produced because of this five-colored soil.</p><p>If Lu Ming had a large amount of five-colored soil, his path-understanding ancient tree would definitely grow rapidly.</p><p>The few of them made use of the time and dug at high speed.</p><p>But not long after, they were still discovered by the alien races.</p><p>“It’s the remnants of the heaven realm, kill!”</p><p>More than a dozen alien races charged toward Lu Ming and the rest. Their auras were very frightening.</p><p>Ren Chan and the others were about to fight.</p><p>leave these alien races to me. I’ll lure them away. You guys continue digging the five-colored soil and medicinal herbs!</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, he rushed toward the foreign tribe members. The infinite Dragon Spear in his hand condensed and he killed them.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming thrust out a few spear gleams in succession, shattering the void and attacking the alien race.</p><p>Among the alien races, there was an extremely burly alien. He wielded a huge Mace and blocked Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>“Rank 17 true Emperor battle power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The strongest of these alien races had the combat power of a rank 17 true Emperor, which was very powerful. Lu Ming did not fight them head-on. Instead, he flapped his six-feathered divine wings. Like a Phantom, Lu Ming bypassed the alien race and attacked the other alien races.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of spear light flashed and a rank 12 true Emperor alien was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, with a sweep of the long spear, a rank 14 true Emperor alien was sent flying. His body almost exploded and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The true Emperor rank-17 alien was furious. Lu Ming actually dared to kill his people right under his nose. He was simply courting death.</p><p>He had no time to care about Ren Chan and the others. He was bent on killing Lu Ming.</p><p>He charged at Lu Ming, but Lu Ming turned around and fled in another direction.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The leader of the alien races roared and led the other alien races in a mad pursuit of Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current abilities, he was still slightly faster than a rank-17 true Emperor alien when he used the six-feathered divine wings. However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to shake off his opponent. Instead, he slowed down on purpose so that his opponent felt that he could catch up to him.</p><p>Therefore, the alien races did not let Lu Ming go. In the blink of an eye, they came to the other direction of Wan Ling mountain.</p><p>“This is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Brat, you know you can’t escape now, go to hell!”</p><p>The alien races charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the fallen star bow and shot an arrow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The rank 17 true Emperor alien was severely injured. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shot another arrow and killed the alien.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, he shot two more arrows and killed two more rank 16 true Emperor alien cultivators.</p><p>The remaining alien races were shocked and wanted to escape. Lu Ming put away the fallen star bow and cast the six-feathered divine wings to give chase.</p><p>The strongest of the remaining alien races were only at level fifteen true Emperor. They were no match for Lu Ming. They wanted to escape but they were not as fast as Lu Ming. Soon, all the alien races were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he put away all the alien races ‘storage rings and crystal cores. Lu Ming landed on Wan Ling mountain and chose a spot to break open the rock, revealing the five-colored soil inside.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at the path-understanding ancient tree!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was rooted on one of the mountain peaks in the mountain and river diagram. Lu Ming crushed the mountain and pulled the path-understanding ancient tree out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure reappeared on Wan Ling mountain. He placed the path-understanding ancient tree into the five-colored soil.</p><p>A sudden change occurred!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
