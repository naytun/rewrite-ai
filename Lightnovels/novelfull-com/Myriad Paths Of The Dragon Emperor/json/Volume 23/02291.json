They did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful that he could kill a rank-17 true Emperor.</p><p>This way, they could completely turn the tide of the battle.</p><p>The other alien races were also shocked.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming pulled the bowstring for the third time. An arrow was shot at another true Emperor rank seventeen alien.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This alien had been severely injured by an arrow. How could the expert who had fought with him miss such an opportunity? he rushed over and killed the other party with one strike.</p><p>The two rank 17 true Emperor aliens were instantly killed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming charged towards the remaining alien race members who had the combat power of a rank-17 true Emperor.</p><p>Every time Lu Ming drew an arrow, the other party would be severely injured and then killed by his opponent.</p><p>By the time Lu Ming shot the fifth arrow, all of the opponents who had the combat power of a rank-17 true Emperor had already died.</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, the three rank-17 true Emperor powerhouses freed up their hands to kill the remaining alien races.</p><p>With the addition of the three rank 17 true emperors, the battle was completely one-sided. Not long after, the remaining alien race members were all killed.</p><p>Only the rank 18 true Emperor alien race member was still fighting the white-haired elder.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The true Emperor rank-18 alien roared and glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>It was all because of Lu Ming that the battle had ended up in such a state.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s arrow was the only reply he got.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A nine-colored arrow with a long tail shot toward the alien.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The foreign being struck out with all his might and blocked the nine-colored arrow, but his body also trembled violently, revealing a flaw.</p><p>The white-haired old man seized the opportunity and injured his opponent with one move.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>At the same time, the others also made their moves. More than 20 attacks were launched at the other party.</p><p>The alien was exhausted and retreated. During this time, Lu Ming shot two more arrows.</p><p>The two arrows were shot out in succession, shocking the other party and causing him to block them repeatedly.</p><p>In this way, he was no match for the white-haired old man at all. He was hit by the white-haired old man’s killing moves and finally killed by the white-haired old man with an unwilling cry.</p><p>At this point, all the alien races in the mine had been killed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, it’s all thanks to you!”</p><p>Ren Chan and the rest came over to thank Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, if it were not for Lu Ming, they would be in danger. Even if they could escape, they would suffer heavy losses, let alone obtain the rough stone.</p><p>“Since we’ve come here together, 1’11 naturally do my best!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and heaved a long sigh. He kept the fallen star bow and took out a pile of raw gemstones to devour and absorb.</p><p>Shooting Seven Arrows in a row just now had consumed a lot of Lu Ming’s energy. He needed to replenish his World Energy.</p><p>“I’ll be here to keep a lookout for you. You guys go and collect the raw stones!”</p><p>Ren Chan said to the others.</p><p>The others nodded and entered the various parts of the mine to collect raw stones.</p><p>Ren Chan, on the other hand, used his supernatural power to observe the surrounding movements through the plants.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged at the side, absorbing the rough stone to restore his cultivation.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming had already recovered to his peak. However, he did not go to dig for the raw gemstones.</p><p>He still had a large number of raw gemstones. It was enough for Lu Ming to use for decades.</p><p>Lu Ming sat at the side and waited.</p><p>After a few days, the group finally ended their excavation.</p><p>This time, they had gained quite a lot, enough to replenish their energy for a period of time. They had to leave now. The longer they stayed, the more dangerous it would be. If the other side sent a great emperor, they would all die.</p><p>The group of people left this place and ran along the mountain forest, rushing towards the small world where they lived.</p><p>With Ren Chan, who could sense them, they were very safe and could avoid the alien races perfectly.</p><p>However, they didn’t dare to increase their speed recklessly. Just like that, after more than half a month of traveling, they finally arrived near the small world where Ren Chan and the others lived.</p><p>In front of them were mountains, but there was no vegetation. It looked dead silent, and gray fog filled the air, making visibility extremely low.</p><p>this is the land of dusk, one of the three Forbidden Lands of ten thousand spirit heavenly domain. It’s the first of the three Forbidden Lands, known as the land of dusk for all living beings. It’s full of terrifying energy and very dangerous!</p><p>Ren Chan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He understood that the entrance to the small world where Ren Chan and the rest lived should be in the land of dusk.</p><p>“Are there no foreign races here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, of course there is!”</p><p>Ren Chan said,” the land of ten thousand spirits ‘three forbidden areas have long been targeted by the alien races. The other two have already been conquered by the alien races. Only the land of dusk has not been conquered yet. The land of dusk is full of terrifying energy. The alien races have attacked it many times and suffered a great loss!</p><p>“Our small world’s entrance is only on the periphery of the land of dusk. We don’t dare to go in because it’s very dangerous. You have to follow us closely later!”</p><p>They concealed their auras and carefully entered the land of dusk.</p><p>This was because there were alien races wandering around nearby. They couldn’t let the alien races find the entrance to the small world. Otherwise, the consequences would be severe. The alien races wouldn’t let them go.</p><p>After entering the land of dusk, their speed slowed down. The white-haired elder walked in front, and the others followed the path he had taken.</p><p>This region was filled with mountains and there was a terrifying pressure. Anyone who looked at it would feel a strong sense of danger.</p><p>The terrain here naturally formed all kinds of terrifying field energy. The more core the land of dusk was, the more terrifying and dangerous the field energy was.</p><p>They advanced carefully. After a few hours, they finally entered an underground crack, entered an underground river, and went through the river to an underground cave.</p><p>There was a pitch-black Vortex here.</p><p>The entrance to the small world was right here. It was extremely well-hidden, so it was no wonder that the foreign races had never found it after so many years.</p><p>They stepped into the vortex. In the next moment, Lu Ming and the rest arrived in a mountain range.</p><p>“We’re here, let’s go to the city!”</p><p>Ren Chan smiled, and the group flew forward.</p><p>This small world was extremely huge and had a wide area. After flying for a while, they arrived at a huge city.</p><p>There were many people and divine beasts in this small world. After all, it was a small world. After so many years of reproduction, there were naturally many of them.</p><p>Therefore, cultivation resources became scarce and the supply could not meet the demand.</p><p>After they arrived at the city, Ren Chan arranged a place for Lu Ming to stay.</p><p>Lu Ming settled down here with peace of mind.</p><p>Since he had come, he would take it!</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could only cultivate while looking for a way to return to the Tai Qing heaven.</p><p>Or, when his cultivation was strong enough, he could just kill his way back. But that would be many years later.</p><p>A few days later, the higher-ups of the small world invited Lu Ming to ask him some questions.</p><p>Lu Ming had come from the Tai Qing heavenly region. This matter had alarmed some of the powerhouses in the small world.</p><p>They asked about the current situation in the Tai Qing heavenly region and how Lu Ming had come..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
