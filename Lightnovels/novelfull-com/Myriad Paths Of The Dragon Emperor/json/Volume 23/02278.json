He also knew that 1000 Yuan was simply impossible. He was just trying to bargain.</p><p>one hundred Yuan is still too much. Give me a little less!</p><p>A non-human heavenly Emperor still wanted to bargain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted the demon-Sky King and smashed it against the city wall again, causing the demon-Sky King to scream in pain.</p><p>“Alright, 100 yuan it is, let’s go and gather the money!”</p><p>The foreign races were left with no choice. One of the foreign celestial thearchs returned to the foreign Army to collect chaos gems.</p><p>I object to using the Prince of a foreign race to exchange for the stone of chaos!</p><p>At this moment, a person from the heaven realm stepped out and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. It was LAN city.</p><p>Lan Cheng looked around and said to the people of the heaven realm, this non-human Prince is too talented. If we let him go, he will be a great enemy to us when he grows up. We must kill him with such a good opportunity!</p><p>His words made many people’s eyes light up.</p><p>That’s right. This non-human Prince was so talented that even the top three of the nine absolutes were no match for him. In the heaven realm, he could be said to be a Supreme talent at the top of the pyramid.</p><p>How terrifying would such a person be when he grew up in the future?</p><p>Many people were moved by Lan Cheng’s words!</p><p>Lan Cheng sneered.</p><p>It was not that easy for Lu Ming to exchange the demonic-sky silk for resources. He wanted to stop him.</p><p>Moreover, the alien race would definitely bear a grudge against Lu Ming after killing mo tianluo. This would only be beneficial to him.</p><p>nonsense! Mo tianluo is Lu Ming’s captive. He has the final say in how to deal with him. No one else has the right to interfere!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu walked over and started cursing.</p><p>How could he not see through Lan Cheng’s thoughts? He was truly despicable and shameless.</p><p>Hengyu, you can’t say that. We can do whatever we want to ordinary prisoners, but this alien Prince is too talented. He concerns the safety of the heavenly realm, so we can’t do whatever we want to him!</p><p>Lan Cheng quibbled, not letting go of the safety of the heavenly realm.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sneered, his voice filled with mockery.</p><p>Lan Cheng looked at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his eyes.”Lu Ming, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>“I’m laughing at you for not having balls!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … How dare you!”</p><p>Lan Cheng was furious. Lu Ming actually dared to say that in front of so many people. How preposterous!</p><p>I finally understand why the heaven realm lost. It’s because there are too many people like you. You don’t have any confidence at all. Without confidence, without the belief that you will win, how can you win? ”</p><p>“If I can defeat this non-human Prince today, I will be able to crush him in the future. Not to mention one non-human Prince, even if there are ten of them, so what? In the future, I can even suppress it with a flip of my hand!”</p><p>“Since I dared to let him go, I will deal with this person in the future. So, you don’t need to worry about it here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, full of confidence.</p><p>“Haha, that’s right. In your eyes, Lan Cheng, this alien Prince might be a great enemy in the future. However, in Lu Ming’s eyes, he’s just a clown. What’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>Hengyu laughed.</p><p>“Who can say for sure what will happen in the future?”</p><p>Lan Cheng said with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Since you can’t be sure, why are you still wasting your breath? maybe I’ll kill him tomorrow!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and turned around, ignoring Lan Cheng.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lan Cheng clenched his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent. However, he concealed it very well.</p><p>He was the celestial Thearch. Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in this manner. He was simply courting death.</p><p>Of course, he would not think about why Lu Ming had such an attitude.</p><p>Because of LAN Yun, back then in yaoguang ancient city, Lu Ming was targeted by LAN city in every way. They wanted to deal with him repeatedly.</p><p>He was the celestial Thearch, but he was targeting Lu Ming, a junior.</p><p>Even a man made of mud would be angry. Lu Ming could not bear it any longer. He simply did not give Lan Cheng a good look.</p><p>At this moment, the celestial Thearch who had gone to collect the chaos gems had returned.</p><p>the chaos gem is here. Release our Prince!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor said.</p><p>“Senior six saints, I’ll have to trouble you!”</p><p>Lu Ming handed the demonic Sky Net to the six sages.</p><p>It would only be foolproof if the six sages heavenly venerate were to make the exchange. If he were to make the exchange, he would definitely be slapped to death by the other party.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages nodded, took the devil Sky Net, and flew out of two world city.</p><p>The other party had no choice but to hand the rock of chaos over to the six sages heavenly venerate in exchange for mo tianluo.</p><p>The sixth Saint returned with a storage bracelet and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look. There were exactly one hundred chaos gems in the storage bracelet.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. A hundred chaos gems was a huge fortune.</p><p>He had been fighting for more than two years on the true Emperor battlefield, but the alien essence crystals he had obtained could only be exchanged for three chaos gems.</p><p>And now, he had obtained 100 chaos gems all at once.</p><p>With these chaos gems, his cultivation would definitely break through to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>There was envy, jealousy, and many other things.</p><p>Take the black Tortoise forest as an example. He was beaten up by the other party when he went to battle, while Lu Ming went to battle and received a hundred chaos gems. The difference was too great.</p><p>As for Lan Cheng’s group, their faces were gloomy.</p><p>The more resources Lu Ming received, the faster he would grow.</p><p>“Brat, there are more heaven’s favorites from our race. Let’s continue the battle!”</p><p>At this moment, a non-human celestial Thearch roared and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, with this, the morale of the heaven realm’s side was not weakened, but instead greatly increased. It was the non-humankind’s side that had low morale.</p><p>They were not willing to give up and called more powerful heaven’s favorites to fight Lu Ming and demoralize the heaven realm.</p><p>“I’m not free!”</p><p>Lu Ming only replied with two words. He then waved his hand and flew toward his residence.</p><p>Now that he had the stone of chaos, Lu Ming could rush back to break through. He was not in the mood to fight.</p><p>damn it, what other heaven’s favorites are there in the heaven realm? call them out and fight with our race’s heaven’s favorites!</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch roared.</p><p>“I’m not free!”</p><p>This was the reply of heavenly venerate six sages.</p><p>He wasn’t that stupid.</p><p>Lu Ming had just won a big victory and restored the morale. Why would he be silly enough to call for a duel again? what if he was abused by the other party and the morale was low?</p><p>Anyway, they had won a great victory, so they should stop while they were ahead.</p><p>The non-human celestial Thearch was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>He had sent out elites to challenge the two world city, but the heaven realm simply ignored them.</p><p>In the end, the alien races had no choice but to retreat.</p><p>Their plan this time had failed completely because of Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming returned to his residence, he entered the mountain and river diagram directly. He took out a pile of raw gemstones and devoured their energy to restore his condition to its peak.</p><p>He then took out a chaos gem. He wanted to use it to break through to the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Breaking through to the true Emperor realm required a lot of energy, but a hundred chaos gems were definitely more than enough.</p><p>He took a deep breath and three streams of chaos Qi flew out of the chaos gem and were sucked into his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming began to refine the mixed-drop Qi to break through to the next realm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
