It’s just a fair spar, yet you want to take his life. 1 can’t let you live with such a heart!”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sneered. His heart was filled with anger.</p><p>“Are you f * eking blind? Who made the first move just now? Who was the first to use a great emperor weapon to kill me? Where did you go just now? Now that you’ve come out to talk, get lost!”</p><p>B0x𝔫𝙤ѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>Lu Ming was completely enraged. He flew into a rage and berated the celestial Thearch regardless of what he was.</p><p>His impression of LAN city was extremely bad.</p><p>From the very beginning, he had been targeted by the other party. However, the other party was the heavenly Emperor. He had endured it before, but now, he could no longer endure it.</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely bold. He actually dared to scold LAN city and tell LAN city to get lost!</p><p>This was a heavenly Emperor! This was simply courting death!</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Lan Cheng was furious. He shouted angrily and struck out a palm, wanting to slap Lu Ming to death.</p><p>A junior actually dared to speak to him like this. If he didn’t make a move to kill him, how could he convince the masses in the future?</p><p>However, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor moved from behind and appeared in front of Lu Ming. He also struck out with his palm and destroyed Lan Cheng’s attack.</p><p>“Hengyu, this kid has no respect for his elders, and you still want to protect him?”</p><p>Lan Cheng roared.</p><p>“No respect for your elders? Why don’t you take a look at what you’ve done? If 1 were Lu Ming, I’d say the same thing. As the celestial Thearch, why can’t I pick on a junior?”</p><p>also, it’s normal for young people to talk back when they’re hot-blooded. Don’t tell me that you don’t have any self-restraint as a heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu laughed coldly.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lan Cheng was burning with anger, but he had no place to vent it.</p><p>the battle just now doesn’t count. After all, both of them used extraordinary weapons. It was unfair!</p><p>At this moment, the master of the star River stepped out and helped Lan Cheng out of the situation. He continued,” “Let’s say that the Black Tortoise forest team and Lu Ming are tied for this battle. Fuliu, you’ll fight Lu Ming!”</p><p>The master of the eternal Star River, the grey-robed elder, looked at the other young man.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man stepped forward.</p><p>The hidden stream was also one of the nine absolutes, but its ranking was far above that of the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>“There’s no need to fight!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu spoke as he exuded a powerful aura, forcing Fu Liu to retreat.</p><p>“Hengyu, you want to interfere in the battle between the younger generation?”</p><p>Lan Cheng seized the opportunity and coldly said.</p><p>“What intervention? This battle started because of the indestructible ancient scroll. Previously, all of you said that Lu Ming could not become a saint Emperor and was not qualified to control the indestructible ancient scroll, which triggered this battle!”</p><p>but now that Lu Ming has become a saint Emperor, this battle is naturally over. There’s no need to fight anymore. Who else in this world is more suitable than Lu Ming to control the indestructible ancient scroll?”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“The indestructible ancient scroll naturally belongs to the stronger. Only the stronger heaven’s favorites can display their true value!”</p><p>Lan Cheng still didn’t give up.</p><p>Bullsh * t. Alright then, tell them to suppress their cultivation to the same level as Lu Ming. Let’s fight at the same level and see who is more suitable?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu shouted.</p><p>Lan Cheng shut up.</p><p>A battle at the same level? what a joke.</p><p>Lu Ming had just become an Emperor, but he was already a four-star illusionary Emperor. Moreover, the strength that he had just displayed was obviously above that of the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>With such heaven-defying combat strength, no one was Lu Ming’s match in a battle of the same level. There was no suspense.</p><p>“Hengyu is right. Lu Ming has already become a divine Emperor. His potential is shocking and his future achievements are limitless. He’s the most suitable person to control the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>At this moment, another heavenly Emperor spoke.</p><p>This Celestial Emperor wasn’t from the primordial realm, but the celestial Emperor of the heaven realm.</p><p>They had no grudges with Lu Ming and had no selfish motives. They simply felt that the indestructible ancient scroll would be the greatest help to the heaven realm if Lu Ming were to grow.</p><p>“Yes, that’s true!”</p><p>“No need to compete anymore!”</p><p>Following that, a few more heavenly emperors spoke up. They were all heavenly emperors from the heaven realm.</p><p>In the city of LAN, the Yan family’s celestial Thearch and the gray-robed elder had gloomy expressions.</p><p>LAN Yun and the rest naturally gritted their teeth. They knew that the indestructible ancient scroll would definitely belong to Lu Ming.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had already proven his value and potential.</p><p>In the past, everyone thought that Lu Ming could not become a Martial Emperor. If he could not become a Martial Emperor, it would be useless no matter how strong his combat strength was.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had become a Martial Emperor, his potential was shocking. In the future, he could continue to break through and his achievements would be limitless.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, the void fluctuated, and an old man with white hair and white clothes stepped out.</p><p>Lan Cheng, the Yan clan heavenly Emperor, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor, and the others all bowed in respect. “Greetings, Lord Empyrean!”</p><p>His words made many people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>A celestial! This old man was a celestial!</p><p>Celestial venerable was a title given by the heaven realm to experts. Only peerless experts above the four-star heavenly Emperor level were qualified to be called celestial venerable.</p><p>It was obvious that this old man was a peerless expert above the four-star heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Empyrean!”</p><p>Countless people bowed in respect.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The white-haired Holy master nodded and looked at Lu Ming in admiration. I already know what happened before. This young man has amazing talent that has never been seen before. Let him keep the indestructible ancient scroll!</p><p>“Many thanks, celestial venerable!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu and the other powerful cultivators from the primordial realm expressed their thanks.</p><p>“Many thanks, Lord Empyrean!”</p><p>Lu Ming also went forward to thank him.</p><p>Lan Cheng and the others were helpless. Since the celestial venerable had spoken, they were even more unable to refute.</p><p>celestial venerable, I think that not only should the indestructible ancient scroll be left with him, but with his talent, his future achievements will be limitless. The heaven realm should concentrate all resources and vigorously cultivate him!</p><p>“No, I object!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lan Cheng immediately jumped out to object.</p><p>celestial venerable, the resources of the heaven realm are limited. We can’t focus on one person!</p><p>furthermore, the war between the two worlds is extremely dangerous. No one can guarantee that they will be able to live forever. If they die halfway, all the resources will be wasted. We can’t put all our eggs in one basket. 1 suggest that we distribute the resources to all the heaven’s favorites like before. Only then will we have the greatest hope!</p><p>Lan Cheng quickly said.</p><p>“This fellow…”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor was extremely displeased, but he couldn’t refute this.</p><p>That was indeed the case. No one could guarantee that he would not die. If Lu Ming died halfway, the resources would be wasted. By distributing the resources to all the prodigies, even if some people died, there would always be others rising. This was the most beneficial for the heaven realm.</p><p>The white-haired old man thought for a while and nodded, that’s right. Let’s just do what we did in the past. We won’t give you any less or more resources. If you want more resources, you have to fight for them yourself. Only then can you grow better. Let’s call it a day. Let’s all go!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lan Cheng waved his hand and left with the LAN family.</p><p>Following that, the Yan family also left the place..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
