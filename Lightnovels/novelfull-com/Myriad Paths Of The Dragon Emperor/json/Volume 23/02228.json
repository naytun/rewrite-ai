Time flew by.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating here for three years.</p><p>After three years of hard work, he had reached the first level of perfection in the penetrating laws. Lu Ming’s physical body and holy power had become more powerful after being tempered time and time again.</p><p>His physical strength was extremely strong, and his Saint power was extremely condensed.</p><p>Furthermore, his usage of nomological laws was getting stronger and stronger. The power of the sacred art techniques he created had increased greatly.</p><p>Compared to three years ago, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a lot.</p><p>However, the life law was still a bit off and had not reached perfection. It was still at 99%.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry. It was true that it would take longer to cultivate an ultimate Maxim, and this was under the path-understanding ancient tree. If he were outside, it would be impossible to cultivate so many maxims to the completion of the first realm in three years.</p><p>It was still the same flat land. Lu Ming and dandan were fighting.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held the sword of death and slashed continuously. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, he waved his hand casually and used all kinds of laws to block Lu Ming’s attack easily.</p><p>“Just a little bit more, just a little bit more!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was firm and persistent. He was trying to integrate the chaos laws into the sword of death.</p><p>“Just a little bit more, melt!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming let out a loud roar. The laws in his body surged and the sword of death in his hand trembled continuously. The sword’s howl was shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the power of the sword of death increased dramatically, and a terrifying sword light slashed toward dandan.</p><p>Not only did this strike contain the power of death from the law of death, but it also contained the mountain-heavy power of the law of chaos.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Lu Ming was ecstatic. However, the next moment, his body trembled violently. He felt two ultimate maxims burst forth with a terrifying tearing force. His palm was about to be torn apart by this tearing force.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>On the other side, dandan shouted loudly. With a shake of her palm, a turtle shell appeared like a shield and blocked in front of him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud bang, the turtle shell Shield condensed by dandan exploded. Dandan quickly retreated and avoided the sharp edge of the death Sword.</p><p>“Kid, you’ve successfully fused?”</p><p>Dandan looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword of death disappeared from Lu Ming’s hand. His palm and even his arm were covered in cracks, and blood was oozing out.</p><p>he circulated his life law, quickly healing the wound on his arm.</p><p>unfortunately, the two nomological laws will still clash and explode with shocking power. I’ve even injured myself!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>this is normal. You’ve just started the fusion and are not familiar with it yet, but this proves that our direction is right. As long as we keep trying, the side effects will disappear!</p><p>hahaha, we’ve created history. If this gets out, it’ll probably scare people to death!</p><p>Dandan was extremely excited.</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed a smile. He understood that after such a long period of hard work, he had finally succeeded.</p><p>Although the fusion of the two ultimate maxims would cause him to be injured, it was only incomplete now. As he continued to perfect it in the future, these side effects would definitely disappear.</p><p>Under the effects of the life law, the wound on Lu Ming’s arm had completely healed.</p><p>“Dandan, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed towards dandan. Where else could he find such a good sparring partner?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword of death reappeared in Lu Ming’s hand. Then, the law of chaos burst out and fused with the sword of death.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This time, he was about to succeed but they still clashed. There was a terrifying explosion of power, causing Lu Ming’s arm to be covered in wounds.</p><p>However, the power of this sword had reached a shocking level. Dan dan had to concentrate to block it.</p><p>This could be said to be Lu Ming’s strongest killing move.</p><p>“In the future, 1’11 merge the life laws into it, and its power will definitely be even stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to continue with dandan when a figure flashed and a white-haired old man appeared. It was Gu Xinghui.</p><p>This was the first time Gu Xinghui had appeared in the past three years.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, it seems that you have made great progress over the years!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks to senior for bringing this junior here to cultivate. Otherwise, this junior would have had to cultivate for several more years to reach my current achievements!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You brat, how come you have time to come here today?”</p><p>Dandan walked over and said loudly.</p><p>“Of course it’s something big!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>“Something big? What’s the big deal?”</p><p>Dandan asked curiously.</p><p>“Mount eternal has appeared. It’s said that the indestructible ancient scroll is hidden in Mount eternal!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Dandan almost jumped up with her eyes shining. She stared at Gu Xinghui and said,”Are you telling the truth?”</p><p>it’s true. Mount eternal has appeared from the void and is now hovering above yaoguang ancient city. Countless experts in the Tai Qing heaven region are heading there to get the indestructible ancient scroll. That’s why I’m here to ask if you’re going!</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>of course we’re going! We can’t miss the indestructible ancient scroll of the undying venerable Emperor!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming and Mu Lan were a little dumbfounded.</p><p>They had never heard of Mount eternal or the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>“This indestructible ancient scroll is so magical?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course. It’s said that those who cultivate the indestructible ancient scroll can not die. Their vitality is extremely strong. Even a drop of blood, a strand of hair, or a wisp of soul can be recovered!</p><p>“Although the life Maxim has a tenacious life force, it’s still far inferior to cultivating the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>“The indestructible ancient scroll is the special skill of the undying venerable sovereign. Do you know about it? He’s an existence on par with the chaos Thearch!”</p><p>He explained a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He was shocked by the unbelievable power of the indestructible ancient scroll and also by the strength of the undying venerable Emperor.</p><p>According to dandan, those who could be called venerable sovereigns were all invincible figures, respected among the emperors, and invincible.</p><p>For example, the chaos monarch and the undying monarch.</p><p>“Since the immortal venerable sovereign is so strong? Then how can anyone else obtain the indestructible ancient scroll? if we go, wouldn’t we just be courting death?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“The undying venerable sovereign is long dead!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>“He’s dead. How could such a person, who cultivated the indestructible ancient scroll, die?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and puzzled.</p><p>sigh, it’s the evil god tribe. In ancient times, during the early stages of the Great War, the undying venerable Emperor was besieged by several people of the same level from the evil god tribe. In the end, he was annihilated, leaving nothing behind. Even with the undying ancient scroll, he still died!</p><p>ever since the death of the undying Emperor, Mount eternal, where he lived, has escaped into the endless void, wandering in the eternal dark void. No one has been able to find it. 1 really didn’t expect that Mount eternal would suddenly appear in the world. Many people are guessing that the ancient indestructible Scripture is about to be Reborn!</p><p>Gu Xinghui sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked tempted.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
