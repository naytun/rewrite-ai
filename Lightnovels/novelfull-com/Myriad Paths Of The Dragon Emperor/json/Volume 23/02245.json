He was very handsome. He stood in the void, but his figure was constantly changing. It was as if he didn’t belong to this space-time.</p><p>space-time law!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered slightly.</p><p>Spacetime laws were the most unpredictable and mysterious. It was one of the most difficult laws to deal with among the top ten laws.</p><p>If it was combined with other nomological laws, the sacred art formed would definitely be very mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming was highly focused. He did not dare to relax.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Mingsheng’s figure moved. In a flash, he pounced toward Lu Ming at top speed. However, when he was halfway through, Mingsheng’s body suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Without thinking, he swung the hammer of chaos backward.</p><p>The huge hammer of chaos was as huge as a mountain. It filled the sky and the void kept exploding.</p><p>However, it did not hit Mingsheng. He was not behind Lu Ming. Instead, he was above Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Mingsheng took a step forward. A terrifying power pierced through the void and formed a terrifying killing force that blasted towards Lu Ming’s head at an astonishing speed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming unfurled his six-feathered divine wings. It was a pair of transparent wings. With a flap, his figure disappeared on the spot and reappeared a thousand meters away, avoiding Ming Sheng’s attack.</p><p>At the same time, the hammer of chaos in Lu Ming’s hand disappeared.</p><p>Although the hammer of chaos was powerful, its speed was not fast. It was not suitable to deal with people like Ming Sheng.</p><p>“Interesting, then let’s compete in speed!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had dodged the attack, Mingsheng sneered. His figure flashed again and he disappeared from the spot.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. With a flash of his six-feathered wings, he left the spot.</p><p>The two of them were astonishingly fast as they flickered in the air. Some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t even see their movements.</p><p>he’s so fast. Mingsheng can control the space-time law. It’s understandable that he’s fast. But why is Lu Ming’s speed so shocking too?”</p><p>“His Divine Art is so amazing. He can actually keep up with Mingsheng’s speed!”</p><p>Many with high cultivation opened their eyes wide and carefully watched the scene, afraid to miss a single thing.</p><p>The two of them were too fast, so fast that they disappeared. If one’s cultivation was not high enough, they would not be able to see them at all. They would only see an empty void.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mingsheng flashed in the void at an extremely fast speed. Within a few minutes, the two of them flashed thousands of times but they did not encounter a single move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, Mingsheng’s figure appeared. He didn’t move anymore, and his expression was a little dark.</p><p>In terms of speed, which was his strong suit, he actually could not suppress Lu Ming. He felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>Mingsheng stopped. Lu Ming also stopped not far away.</p><p>“Your speed is useless in front of me!”</p><p>Mingsheng said coldly, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“He is indeed a six-star void Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Ming Sheng’s cultivation was higher than that of the short-haired young man. He had reached the level of a six-star void Emperor.</p><p>“Mountain river palm!”</p><p>Mingsheng moved. He soared into the sky and then slapped down with his palm.</p><p>An extremely huge palm print formed. As soon as the palm print appeared, it quickly evolved and finally turned into a world of mountains and rivers.</p><p>One could see that there were mountains, rivers, and lakes inside. It was like an entire world, suppressing the entire void and pressing down on Lu Ming. The scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Facing such an attack, there was no way to Dodge it. The only way was to take it head-on.</p><p>The hammer of chaos appeared in Lu Ming’s hands again and it grew rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the chaos hammer with both hands and swung it at the mountain river World as if he wanted to blow this world up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a deafening boom and the world of mountains and rivers shook violently. However, the hammer of chaos in Lu Ming’s hand shook even more violently. He could feel an extremely powerful force surging toward him.</p><p>It was as if he was really shaking the world.</p><p>His body trembled violently as he retreated. His qi and blood were in turmoil.</p><p>what a powerful force. This person has already mastered four types of nomological laws, three of which have already reached the second realm!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and stabilized the surging blood in his body.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and Lu Ming could sense Mingsheng’s ability.</p><p>It was extremely shocking. His cultivation had reached the level of a six-star illusionary Emperor and he had mastered four types of laws, one of which was an ultimate law and three of which were King path laws. He had already reached the second realm in the space-time law and two of the king path laws.</p><p>Furthermore, this person’s magical power Technique was formed from four types of nomological laws, which was very shocking.</p><p>Although some people could control many types of nomological laws, such as five types of nomological laws, their super power Technique was only composed of three types of nomological laws and could not display their full power.</p><p>For example, although Lu Ming had mastered nine types of laws, his divine power Technique was not made up of nine types of laws.</p><p>It could be said that Mingsheng’s battle power was very shocking. He was several times stronger than the short-haired youth from before.</p><p>you can take one of my palm strikes. Not bad. Let’s see how many of my palm strikes you can take. Level two mountain river palm!</p><p>Mingsheng said coldly. His entire body emitted a brilliant light as he struck out with another palm.</p><p>This time, two mountain river worlds were formed and pressed down on Lu Ming. The power was even more shocking.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long roar. The power of his body was circulated to the extreme. He condensed a strong Saint power and poured it into the hammer of chaos. He swung the hammer at his opponent.</p><p>Another deafening boom was heard. The force rolled in all directions and a figure was forced to retreat. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, he was still at a disadvantage and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Mingsheng shouted and launched a series of attacks.</p><p>This time, three worlds were formed and they pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming also unleashed his full power and cast seven types of laws.</p><p>Chaos, devour, extremity, penetration, formation Dao, alchemy Dao, and craftsmanship Dao!</p><p>Apart from the death rule and the life rule, which he had not integrated, Lu Ming had used all his strength.</p><p>The power of the hammer of chaos was even more astonishing, and it collided with the mountain river World.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming directly pierced through the opponent’s three layers of mountains and rivers, causing Mingsheng to retreat continuously.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight with Mingsheng and even force him to retreat. This was too terrifying.</p><p>Ming Sheng had the cultivation base of a six-star void Emperor. In addition, Ming Sheng’s own talent made it easy for him to defeat an ordinary seven-star void Emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was able to defeat him.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming could also defeat an ordinary seven-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming was only an Emperor-to-be, but he was able to defeat an ordinary seven-star illusionary Emperor. This was equivalent to crossing an entire realm.</p><p>Many people looked at each other. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would not have believed that all this was real.</p><p>I heard that Lu Ming has mastered two ultimate maxims. I wonder if it’s true!</p><p>1 don’t know. It’s incredible that he can control two ultimate maxims!</p><p>in my opinion, it might be true. Didn’t you notice that he has already used seven maxims? this is already unbelievable. I wouldn’t be surprised if he can control another ultimate Maxim.</p><p>however, even if he has mastered two ultimate maxims, it won’t be of much use to improve his combat strength. This is because ultimate maxims can’t be merged, and it’s impossible to construct a divine power!</p><p>“That’s true!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
