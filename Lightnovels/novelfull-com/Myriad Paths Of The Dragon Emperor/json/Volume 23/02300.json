They were so dense that one couldn’t see the end of it. From afar, one could see many people coming and going in the city.</p><p>This place was like a real world. It was like a huge country.</p><p>It was said that there were many cultivation systems in the immemorial era.</p><p>For example, the immemorial body cultivator, the immemorial martial Dao, the immemorial demonic Dao, the immemorial devil Dao, and so on…</p><p>There were many cultivation paths, and they were extremely prosperous, later on, the origin law system rose up and expanded at an astonishing speed. This was because the ancient cultivation system had extremely high requirements in all aspects. The cultivation conditions were harsh, and only a few people could cultivate it.</p><p>However, the nomological system didn’t have such high requirements. As long as one had some talent, they could cultivate it and naturally grow very quickly.</p><p>It didn’t take long for the nomological system to become the most powerful cultivation system.</p><p>Where there were people, there would be martial arts!</p><p>&Nbsp; the various systems fought against each other and then a shocking war broke out.</p><p>&Nbsp; the various ancient systems were fighting against the law systems.</p><p>That battle was earth-shattering, but in the end, it ended with a great victory for the nomological system.</p><p>As for the other systems, many of their inheritances were severed and they fell apart. Slowly, they became weaker and weaker. By now, there were not many people who cultivated the immemorial system.</p><p>However, there was such a world here. Could it be that it had been here since the immemorial era?</p><p>Everyone’s imagination ran wild!</p><p>After that, they flew into the city. Countless people looked at Lu Ming and the rest curiously, whispering to each other.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at another square. There were already quite a few people on the square.</p><p>There were old men, middle-aged men, and young people.</p><p>All of them had powerful qi and blood, like wild dragons.</p><p>Even though the hair of the elders had turned white, their skin was smooth and their muscles were full, as if they were filled with boundless strength.</p><p>“Elder!”</p><p>The burly man in the lead came before a few white-haired elders and bowed to report. He then told them in detail about his encounter with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The few elders nodded. One of them walked toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Were you the ones who disturbed our ancestor’s slumber a while ago?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“Senior, it wasn’t us!”</p><p>One of the great emperors on Lu Ming’s side said.</p><p>“Not you? Some time ago, our ancestor was disturbed and walked out of the tomb. He roared and fought with people. This time, we sent people to check and happened to see you. How can you say it wasn’t you?”</p><p>The old man’s face darkened.</p><p>senior, it really wasn’t us. The ones who attacked this place were the alien races. We were also chased by the alien races, so we fled here!</p><p>An Emperor explained.</p><p>“A foreign race? What alien race? Could it be a divine beast? There are also many divine beasts among you!”</p><p>The old man was puzzled and his gaze swept across Lu Ming and the rest, it’s not a divine beast. It’s a race from another world. They’re fierce and brutal. Most of the territories in the heaven realm have been occupied by them, and countless creatures have died in battle!</p><p>The great emperor explained.</p><p>“What? A race from another world?”</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>On the side, the expressions of the other immemorial body cultivators also changed.</p><p>my body cultivators have been living in seclusion here ever since the war in the ancient times. I’ve never left. What’s happening in the outside world now?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts moved. No wonder the other party didn’t know about the foreign races. They had been living in seclusion here since the ancient era.</p><p>The immemorial era was much longer than the ancient era. During the immemorial era, the foreign races had yet to invade.</p><p>“Senior, it’s like this …”</p><p>The great emperor immediately recounted the invasion of the foreign tribes in the ancient times in detail.</p><p>Then, he told them how they were besieged, how they escaped in defeat, and how they had no choice but to escape to the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>The old man and the other Archean body cultivators all listened attentively. After they finished listening, their expressions became extremely heavy, senior, of the nine heaven domains in the heaven realm, eight have been occupied by the Outlanders. The ten thousand spirit heavenly domain was occupied countless years ago. Now, countless small worlds and other Forbidden Lands have been occupied by the Outlanders. Only the land of dusk has not been occupied. I speculate that the Outlanders will not let this place go. They will mobilize a large number of powerful cultivators to attack this place!</p><p>The great emperor said.</p><p>The old man’s expression was uncertain. After a while, he said,” “What you guys said, is it true or false?”</p><p>It was obvious that they were still skeptical.</p><p>In the battle that year, the immemorial body cultivator had been defeated by the system of laws. They did not have a good impression of people who had the system of laws.</p><p>“Every word is true!”</p><p>The great emperor said, and the others nodded in agreement.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a few burly men flew over at top speed, their faces filled with panic.</p><p>“Elder, a large number of experts have appeared in the ancestor’s slumbering grounds. I don’t know which race they are from, but they are attacking the ancestor’s slumbering grounds!”</p><p>A burly man reported.</p><p>“What? Gather the experts and face the enemy!”</p><p>The elder roared, and his voice spread far and wide. Soon, the sound of a bell rang out from the giant city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Countless figures flew out of the buildings in the city and toward the exit of the world.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were secretly shocked.</p><p>Among them, some of their auras were terrifyingly strong. They were definitely figures of the great emperor realm, and there was no lack of heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses.</p><p>“You guys keep an eye on them, don’t let them go anywhere!”</p><p>The elder ordered the people around him, then rose into the air and also headed towards the world exit.</p><p>There were more than ten burly men around them, staring at Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest waited quietly.</p><p>Two days passed, and they saw a large number of figures flying back to the city.</p><p>it seems like we won. The immemorial body cultivators are indeed powerful!</p><p>Ren Chan’s beautiful eyes flickered as she said.</p><p>The others also revealed looks of joy. No matter what, the immemorial body cultivators were still humans, so they were better than the foreign races.</p><p>At this moment, a few figures flew over. The one in the middle was a young man.</p><p>The young man looked to be in his twenties. He was well-built and muscular, as if he was full of infinite strength.</p><p>He flew toward Lu Ming and the group, sizing them up curiously, the elder asked me to pass on a message. He believes that what you said is true. With the current situation, all the races in the heaven realm should unite with each other. So, you can move freely here in the future. 1 will arrange your accommodation!</p><p>Ren Chan and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>They were saved. It was clear that the strong ancient body cultivators who had gone out to fight with the foreign races had finally believed their words and agreed to accept them.</p><p>“This brother, I wonder how the battle situation outside is?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and asked with cupped fists.</p><p>the alien tribes outside have been defeated by the powerhouses and the sacred ancestor body!</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>I’m guessing that the other races will probably send more troops and experts!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his expression still somewhat solemn..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
