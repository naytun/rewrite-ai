With a loud shout, the entire sky trembled. He held a battle saber in his hand, and he slashed out at the evil god race being.</p><p>The evil god race member howled out in anger as he unleashed all of his cultivation. However, it was useless. As the saber Light slashed out, the evil god race member was split into two.</p><p>After killing the evil god tribe member, the figure stood in the air. After a while, it turned into specks of light and dissipated.</p><p>It was the mark of an expert that could not be destroyed. When it sensed an expert approaching, it would appear and kill him.</p><p>even true emperors will be in danger if they enter this ancient battlefield. It’s fine if a high-stage true Emperor keeps a low profile, but flying at such a high speed in such a high-profile way is simply courting death!</p><p>Dandan said in disdain.</p><p>The two of them immediately rushed over and took the true Emperor’s storage ring and bracelet.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed, but they had gained nothing in these few days.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent roar came from the front.</p><p>The two of them concealed their auras and flew into the sky. They hid in the clouds and slowly floated forward. Soon, they saw a Castle in front of them.</p><p>At this moment, there was a group of people from the evil god race surrounding the castle and attacking it continuously.</p><p>It was unknown what material the castle was made of, but it looked very old. The gate of the castle was tightly closed, and there was a layer of light on the gate.</p><p>The evil god race members were bombarding the castle’s Gate, trying to break it open.</p><p>“There’s a Castle here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised.</p><p>They had been walking around for so many days, but this was the first time they had seen a building.</p><p>the castle that appeared here must be extraordinary. It might be the temporary imperial residence of a peerless expert!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were already shining.</p><p>“Dandan, do you want to go in? However, there are so many evil god tribesmen in front of us. With just the two of us, we are still far from enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In front of the castle, there were at least a hundred members of the evil god tribe. From the way they were attacking the castle’s Gate, one could tell that there were quite a number of experts, and there were quite a number of true Emperor realm figures.</p><p>There were even high stage true emperors.</p><p>This time, the evil god tribe had sent a large number of experts in. Although it was very dangerous for a high-stage true Emperor to be in this region, as they would be detected by the power law imprint and killed, the evil god tribe had sent a large number of experts in.</p><p>However, there would always be some lucky ones who would not encounter the mark of a powerhouse.</p><p>Although dandan was strong, she was no match for a high-stage true Emperor.</p><p>The two of them frowned as they tried to think of a solution.</p><p>1 can set up an absolute killing formation in advance. If 1 can lure the evil god race into the formation, 1 can kill them. However, I need to lure them in!</p><p>Dandan frowned and muttered.</p><p>“I’ll go lure them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“You’re going to lure them? No, even though you’ve learned the six divine wings and your speed has increased greatly, he’s still not fast enough to escape from a true Emperor!”</p><p>Dandan shook her head.</p><p>“Don’t worry, what if 1 attack from a hundred miles away?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and the large bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>Dandan looked at the big bow carefully, and her eyes were filled with a fiery light. She said,” fallen star bow, this is the fallen star bow. Kid, you actually got the fallen star bow? ”</p><p>As she said that, dandan almost drooled and reached out to grab the big bow.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it hurriedly and looked at him with a ‘sad’ expression.</p><p>“You know the origin of this bow?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course, this bow was famous in the ancient times. It was the weapon of a peerless expert and was said to be able to shoot down the stars in the sky with one arrow. It’s extremely terrifying. Unfortunately, the loss of its spirituality is too severe and it’s far from its power back then!</p><p>Dandan said, but her eyes were still shining with a fiery light.</p><p>“The fallen star bow?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He was already very satisfied. Even though the spirituality was severely damaged, it was enough for him. He could only pull it open a little.</p><p>“Dandan, let’s go back and set up the formation. You set up the formation, 1’11 go lure people!”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic so that dandan would not keep thinking about the fallen star bow.</p><p>Dandan sighed, lamenting the injustice of the heavenly Dao. Why was it that he was so wise, brilliant, and unparalleled, but his luck was not as good as Lu Ming’s?</p><p>In the end, the two of them retreated and chose a place thousands of miles away. Then, they began to set up the formation.</p><p>Dandan’s mastery of runes and formations had reached an unimaginable realm. Any nomological law could be turned into runes in his hands and integrated into the large formation.</p><p>This was a realm that Lu Ming was far from reaching.</p><p>An hour later, dandan shouted,” it’ll be done soon. This formation is enough to kill a peak true Emperor. Go and lure them in. I hope they haven’t broken through the castle yet!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and dashed in the direction of the castle.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming was a hundred miles away from the castle.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and took out the fallen star bow.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, he could shoot from a thousand miles away if he drew the fallen star bow. However, the power would be relatively weaker.</p><p>Within a hundred miles, the fallen star bow’s power could be fully unleashed.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the fallen star bow and a rainbow arrow streaked across the void, shooting toward one of the evil god tribe members outside the castle.</p><p>The speed was too fast, and it was a sneak attack. The other party didn’t have time to react.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A six-star illusionary Emperor from the evil god tribe was shot to death by the arrow.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The other members of the evil god tribe roared. They swept their gazes and immediately discovered Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s the human race! You’re courting death!</p><p>Some of the evil god race members roared in anger.</p><p>Lu Ming turned and left. He cast the six-feathered divine wings and ran at an astonishing speed toward the place where dandan had set up the formation.</p><p>“The castle’s main gate is about to be breached. We’ll attack the main gate first!”</p><p>One of the true Emperor-level evil god race members spoke. They did not pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>After running for a while, Lu Ming realized that the evil god tribe was not chasing after him.</p><p>WOWO, it seems that killing one won’t work. Let’s kill a few more!</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the past and landed a hundred miles away.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming drew his bow and shot three arrows.</p><p>This time, the evil god tribe was prepared, but it was still useless. Two six-star void emperors and one seven-star void Emperor were severely injured.</p><p>damn it, you human insect! You’re seeking your own death! You guys, come with me and kill him!</p><p>One of the evil god tribe’s true thearchs bellowed and led a few high-level void thearchs in pursuit of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the six-feathered divine wings, turned around, and ran.</p><p>The distance of a few thousand miles was covered in the blink of an eye.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, an extremely huge turtle came crashing down.</p><p>A true Emperor of the evil god tribe and a few high-level void emperors were killed instantly.</p><p>Dandan stepped down from the sky and said,” “He’s just a one-star true Emperor. He doesn’t even need me to activate the formation. Lu Ming, you’re not good enough. Lure a few more experts over. How about this? leave the fallen star bow to me. 1’11 do it!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes rolled.</p><p>Lu Ming did not need to guess to know that dandan was coveting the fallen star bow.</p><p>Lu Ming would not let him have his way. He said,” there’s no need. I’ll go and lure them.. I’ll definitely lure you a few big fish!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
