He had a gentle smile on his face and no aura could be felt from his body. He was just like a kind old man.</p><p>‚ÄúLu Ming, I‚Äôve called you here to give you some rewards!‚Äù</p><p>all top heaven‚Äôs favorites will be nurtured by the higher-ups in the heaven realm. They can enter and leave some cultivation Holy Lands freely. Take this token!</p><p>A token appeared in sixth saint‚Äôs hand and he handed it to Lu Ming. It was the same token that the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor had given Mu Lan.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and kept it.</p><p>B0xùî´ùô§—µùëíùô°.com</p><p>there are detailed records of the cultivation sanctuaries in the token. You can look at the places you want to go to cultivate in the future. Also ‚Ä¶</p><p>After saying that, heavenly venerate six sages raised his hand and three gray stones appeared in the sky.</p><p>‚ÄúThis is ‚Ä¶ Chaos gems!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>This was definitely a stone of chaos. Lu Ming would not be mistaken. He had obtained one in the past at an auction in the heavenly Emperor City. Back then, people thought that the chaos stone‚Äôs chaos Qi had dried up. Hence, it was not expensive. Otherwise, the price would be very shocking.</p><p>These three chaos gems obviously hadn‚Äôt dried up. They contained chaos Qi that could be sensed.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs heart was burning.</p><p>Chaos Qi was better than primordial Qi. It was a top-notch treasure for cultivating a small world. After refining it, the small world‚Äôs evolution could be accelerated. At the same time, it would be more stable and could also improve one‚Äôs cultivation level.</p><p>take these three chaos gems. They‚Äôre an additional reward for you!</p><p>With that, he waved his hand and three chaos gems flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and thanked the six sages.</p><p>this is all I can give you. After all, the resources of the heaven realm are limited. If all of them are concentrated on one person, many people will have objections!</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs those people from Blue City again!‚Äù</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor said unhappily.</p><p>The heavenly venerate smiled helplessly.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. It seemed that two world city was not as united as it seemed. There were many tricks up its sleeve. There were probably many factions.</p><p>Where there were people, there would be competition. Lu Ming understood this very well.</p><p>Lu Ming, 1 can only give you so many consumables like the chaos stones, primordial chaos stones, and the world core. If you want more, you can only fight for it yourself. As for those non-consumables like cultivation sanctuaries, you don‚Äôt have to worry about that. You‚Äôre free to enter!</p><p>The sixth Saint added.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He understood that the more he used chaos gems, primordial chaos gems, and the like, the less he used them. The cultivation world had such a long history. These treasures must be pathetically few and limited.</p><p>As for some cultivation Holy Lands, such as places that could help people comprehend the Dao, such places could be recycled, and people could naturally enter freely.</p><p>He believed that the other heaven‚Äôs favorites would be treated the same way!</p><p>Lu Ming was already very satisfied. The value of three chaos gems was shocking.</p><p>‚ÄúMay I ask, celestial venerable, how should I fight for more chaos gems, primordial chaos gems, and other things?‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>when you kill alien races, a kind of crystal core will be formed in their bodies. That is the source of energy for alien races. As long as you take the crystal core of an alien race, you can exchange it for treasures. As long as you have enough crystal cores, you can exchange for any treasure, including chaos gems and so on!</p><p>The celestial said.</p><p>hunting alien races?!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists. He was here to kill the alien races. He could hunt for the crystal cores and Exchange them for treasures. It was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor bade farewell to the six sages. The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor then arranged a place for them to stay.</p><p>In a courtyard, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and consolidated his cultivation.</p><p>The small world in his body burst out with a strong suction force. From the outside world, endless origin Qi gathered toward Lu Ming. Through Lu Ming‚Äôs pores, it surged into his body and then into the small world, becoming a part of it.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to refine the chaos Qi in the chaos gem. His cultivation had just broken through and he planned to consolidate it for a while.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming stopped absorbing the origin Energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>Now, he planned to start comprehending the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his attention. In his mind, all kinds of profound mysteries related to the indestructible ancient scroll emerged and Lu Ming began to comprehend them in detail.</p><p>to cultivate the indestructible ancient scroll to large success, I need as many as 18 types of nomological laws!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>In other words, if he could cultivate the indestructible ancient scroll to large success, he would be able to derive 18 nomological laws.</p><p>This was extremely shocking. An ordinary ancient scripture only contained a few types of laws. After cultivating it to large success, one could only control a few types of laws. An ancient scripture with nine types of laws was already very shocking. It could allow one to cultivate all the way to the great emperor realm.</p><p>However, the indestructible ancient scroll contained 18 types of nomological laws. No wonder it was known as one of the most famous ancient scrolls in the heaven realm. It made many people envious.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming had only mastered three of the 18 laws.</p><p>Life laws, array laws, and artifact laws.</p><p>The core law of the indestructible ancient scroll was the law of life.</p><p>Indestructible, indestructible, it was the interpretation of an extremely powerful life force. Only by controlling the life law would one have the opportunity to cultivate the indestructible ancient scroll to the great completion level, and then be able to display its greatest effect.</p><p>If it were any other Son of Heaven, although they could also cultivate, it would be impossible to cultivate to large success. This was because they had already mastered one of the ultimate laws, and it was impossible for them to control the life law.</p><p>On the other hand, ordinary King physiques could still be cultivated to large success if they did not have someone who had mastered an ultimate Maxim. This was because they could use the indestructible ancient scroll to deduce the life Maxim.</p><p>In addition, there were also array Dao laws.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that many people cultivated array Dao laws in their divine abilities.</p><p>The paragons who had fought with him before all had array Dao laws in their laws.</p><p>The array Dao laws could condense endless runes and change into a myriad of forms. It was indeed the most ideal law to construct a divine power Technique.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll required 18 types of laws, but Lu Ming only controlled three of them. However, he could already cultivate them. Furthermore, he had the life law. The power that he could cultivate would definitely not be weak.</p><p>to cultivate divine arts, one must find a place that is beneficial to comprehending divine arts!</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. He took out the token given to him by the sixth Saint and studied it carefully.</p><p>After reading it, Lu Ming left the courtyard and headed to a place in two world city.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived in front of an ancient Hall. There were guards outside the hall, but Lu Ming entered easily after taking out his token.</p><p>After walking into the ancient palace, there was a door of light.</p><p>This door of light LED to a small world.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the door of light without hesitation. The next moment, he appeared on a mountain peak.</p><p>as expected, it‚Äôs a path-understanding ancient tree!</p><p>Standing on the mountain peak, Lu Ming looked into the distance and was shocked.</p><p>There was also a path-understanding ancient tree in two world city. This path-understanding ancient tree had fully matured. It blocked out the sky and the sun. Like a World Tree, it surged into the clouds.</p><p>Between the branches, there was a great Dao surrounding it, which was extremely mysterious.</p><p>It was more than ten times taller than the path-understanding ancient tree in the Gu family..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
