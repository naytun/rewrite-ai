These two are so young, so how can they unleash the power of these treasures? I’m going to keep these treasures and hand them over to the experts in two world city. Only in the hands of those experts will these treasures be able to display their brilliance and be used against the evil god tribe!</p><p>LAN Yun sneered and quibbled.</p><p>“What a joke. Since when have we heaven realm experts stooped so low as to snatch away the opportunities and treasures of the younger generation in order to deal with the evil god race? If that’s the case, we’ll never be a match for the evil god tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response, full of sarcasm.</p><p>This LAN Yun was obviously greedy and wanted to take the treasure, but he found such a Grand reason. What a joke.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, some of them looked ashamed and took a few steps back. They seemed to be hesitating whether to make a move.</p><p>Mu Lan and Jian feiliu were obviously humans. They had clearly violated the rules of two world city by attacking humans and snatching their treasures in the ancient battlefield.</p><p>However, there were still some people who were clearly unwilling to give up, and the greed in their eyes became even stronger.</p><p>brat, it’s no use even if you have a glib tongue. It’s a waste to give these treasures to them. It’s such a waste of heavenly resources. Today, I’ll definitely take these treasures and give them to the experts of two world city!</p><p>LAN Yun continued, not backing down in the slightest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. This LAN Yun was really despicable and shameless.</p><p>LAN Yun, since you say so, then hand over all the treasures and various resources on you. Those treasures and resources are also a waste on trash like you, so it’s better to give them to stronger people to use!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Killing intent burst out from LAN Yun’s eyes. Lu Ming actually called him trash.</p><p>I said you’re a piece of trash. Can’t you hear me? hand over all your treasures and resources to me. It’s a waste to give them to you anyway!</p><p>Lu Ming added.</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. So you’re saying that you’re very strong?”</p><p>LAN Yun laughed out loud. He was a top-notch heaven’s pride expert in the heaven realm. Before he became an Emperor, he was a Son of Heaven. Lu Ming actually called him trash.</p><p>“Brat, you provoked me first. If I don’t break your four limbs today, my name isn’t lan Yun!”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted angrily.</p><p>if it’s not blue cloud, then green cloud will do. There’s a patch of green on top of my head…</p><p>Lu Ming was talking nonsense with him mainly to stall for time so that dandan could set up the array.</p><p>At this moment, dandan was quietly shuttling through the crowd, and one rune after another was buried into the ground.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to cripple you!”</p><p>LAN Yun was so furious that he pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the six-feathered divine wings and a pair of transparent wings appeared. In a flash, he dodged LAN Yun’s attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>LAN Yun launched a storm-like attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s six-feathered divine wings were too fast, and he dodged all of LAN Yun’s attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming did not fight back. Naturally, he was stalling for time to buy time for dandan to set up the array.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, LAN Yun had made hundreds of moves, but he did not touch Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Many people were shocked!</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. He was completely fine under LAN Yun’s violent attacks.</p><p>“Didn’t you say it was very strong? If you have the ability, then fight me head on!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with him and continued to Dodge with his movement technique. After dozens of moves, the blue cloud still did not touch Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“LAN Yun, 1’11 help you!”</p><p>At that moment, Yan Xi dashed out and launched an attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi were both three-star illusionary emperors. Moreover, both of them were top geniuses of the heaven realm. They had mastered one of the strongest laws and had cultivated it to the second realm. In addition, they had also mastered other laws. Their strength was very shocking.</p><p>The two of them joined forces and attacked Lu Ming from two directions. It was not so easy for Lu Ming to dodge them completely.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>LAN Yun, who was behind Lu Ming, struck out a palm. This palm was as fast as lightning and as Swift as Thunder. Its power was shocking.</p><p>At the same time, Yan Xi also launched an attack. He slashed out layers of Saber Light, which enveloped Lu Ming in three directions.</p><p>In this case, Lu Ming had nowhere to run.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice entered Lu Ming’s ears. It was dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the aura on his body burst forth. Seven types of laws glowed with different lights and flickered on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A giant hammer appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>This was his original divine power, the hammer of chaos.</p><p>BOOM! boom! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his hammer four times in a row, blasting in all directions.</p><p>Immediately, the saber Light that Yan Xi was slashing at Lu Ming shattered. His body trembled violently and he retreated continuously.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>One of the Hammers struck LAN Yun’s palm, erupting with a massive boom.</p><p>LAN Yun’s body also trembled and retreated.</p><p>“It’s you? The primordial realm’s peerless trash, you’re Lu Ming!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared.</p><p>Lu Ming attacked with all his might, and seven types of laws burst forth. LAN Yun immediately recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? A peerless trash body of the primordial realm?”</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>At the scene, many people reacted.</p><p>Back then, when the prodigies who went to the primordial realm returned, they said that a peerless cripple had appeared in the primordial realm. He hadn’t even become a sovereign, but he had already mastered two Supreme laws and many King path laws.</p><p>This matter had spread widely among the heaven realm’s prodigy circle, and many people had heard of it.</p><p>Jian feiliu had the biggest reaction. His body shook and he looked at Lu Ming with bright eyes.</p><p>He was shocked by the two words ‘Lu Ming’.</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s me, your Grandpa!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily, revealing his true appearance.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s face, Jian feiliu’s eyes lit up. He was shocked, surprised, and in disbelief.</p><p>He had come to the heaven realm and acknowledged a terrifying expert as his master. His cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds over the years, and he had made rapid progress. Naturally, his vision had also become much higher, far from what it was before.</p><p>But he never expected that a friend he made in the divine wilderness continent’s East barren would be able to come here. At the same time, his combat strength was also shockingly strong.</p><p>This was really out of his expectations.</p><p>“Brother Lu, let me help you!”</p><p>Jian feiliu shouted as the long sword above his head kept buzzing.</p><p>no need. You protect Senior Sister Mu Lan!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed a member of the LAN family. You’ll pay the price today. Attack! There’s no need to talk about rules with such a person!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared and asked the other members of the LAN family to attack.</p><p>At that moment, the true Emperor from the LAN family moved. He exploded with a terrifying aura and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Shameless guy, watch me!”</p><p>At this moment, dandan shouted and waved her hands, and dense runes appeared on the ground.</p><p>The runes condensed into chains. Each chain was as thick as an arm, and they swept towards the experts of the LAN family..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
