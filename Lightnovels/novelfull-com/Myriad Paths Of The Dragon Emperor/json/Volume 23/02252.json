Their power was terrifying.</p><p>Some people couldn’t help bur retreat, distancing themselves from the Tribulation clouds.</p><p>Such a terrifying Heavenly Tribulation was truly frightening. If they were to be enveloped by it, they would definitely die.</p><p>This was especially so for those who had a grudge against Lu Ming, such as the LAN family’s celestial Thearch and the others. They were afraid that Lu Ming would take this opportunity to take revenge and would rush towards them during the Tribulation and envelop them.</p><p>They were on guard at all times.</p><p>However, Lu Ming clearly did not have such plans. A heavenly Emperor was too fast. How could he possibly catch up to him?</p><p>He was now seriously fighting against the heaven realm.</p><p>“Break, break! Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept swinging the hammer of chaos and bombarding the beast God heavenly domain.</p><p>In an instant, after more than a dozen strikes, the beast God heavenly domain could not withstand the attacks and was blown up in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people let out a long breath. This scene was too impactful.</p><p>It was as if a heavenly domain had been blown up by Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the second heavenly domain, the netherworld heavenly domain, was already pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming waved the hammer of chaos and struck the abysmal heavenly realm.</p><p>In the netherworld, there were also creatures that rushed out to lull Lu Ming.</p><p>But at this moment, in the Tribulation clouds, endless thunder and lightning gathered again, forming another world.</p><p>This was also a heavenly domain, one of the nine heavenly domains in the heaven realm, and it was pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>will all the nine heavenly regions appear? ”</p><p>Someone said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>The third heavenly domain came crashing down on Lu Ming at an alarming speed.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could blow up the netherworld, a third heavenly domain descended and merged with the netherworld.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two heavenly domains merged, and the power increased dramatically. The terrifying power pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming s body trembled violently and he retreated continuously. His face was a little pale.</p><p>“He’s not going to make it, haha!”</p><p>LAN Yun laughed loudly, extremely excited.</p><p>He was looking forward to Lu Ming failing to transcend the Tribulation and dying.</p><p>Heng Xing River, Yuan Xin, and the others all had the same thought.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. He had yet to become a great emperor but he could already defeat them. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>Previously, they consoled themselves that Lu Ming would never become an Emperor. They would definitely be able to suppress Lu Ming easily in the future.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming became a Martial Emperor, they could no longer find an excuse to console themselves. With Lu Ming’s combat strength, he could easily suppress them once he became a Martial Emperor.</p><p>They had been looking forward to Lu Ming failing the Tribulation. They were overjoyed to see Lu Ming being repelled by the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The two heavenly domains pressed down on Lu Ming. In the sky, the Tribulation clouds were forming a fourth heavenly domain.</p><p>“Kill!’1</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared. The sword of death appeared in his other hand and he charged at the two heavenly regions.</p><p>They kept striking the heaven domain.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued. Lu Ming did not care about his own defense and attacked with all his might.</p><p>Finally, the abysmal heaven was also destroyed by Lu Ming, but in exchange, Lu Ming was covered in wounds.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the life law. He circulated the life law and his injuries were healing rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, the fourth heavenly domain overlapped with the third heavenly domain and pressed down on Lu Ming. At the same time, the fifth heavenly domain was rapidly forming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to bombard the third heavenly domain before the fifth heavenly domain was formed.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was still a step too late.</p><p>Before Lu Ming could blast open the third heavenly domain, the fifth heavenly domain had already stacked up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming s body was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood and was severely injured.</p><p>However, with the life law, Lu Ming’s injuries were healing rapidly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to delay. He took a step forward and rushed to the heaven domain like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>In his hand, the two weapons fused into one, turning into a long spear.</p><p>A shocking spear radiance pierced out and stabbed toward a third heavenly domain.</p><p>The third heavenly domain was already unstable after Lu Ming s previous attacks. Now, it exploded and even the fourth heavenly domain was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>However, the sixth heavenly domain had also been formed.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and channeled all his power to bombard the fourth heavenly domain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as the sixth heaven domain stacked up, he finally blew up the fourth heaven domain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was also sent flying by a terrifying force. He was covered in wounds and many of his bones were broken.</p><p>He was severely injured.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about his injuries. He circulated the life law to heal himself while he rushed to the heaven domain above.</p><p>Right now, he had to fight against rhe heavenly Tribulation. If rhe heavenly Tribulation stacked more than three times on the heavenly domain, he would be in danger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air. It contained eight types of laws. The Laws of Chaos and the laws of death were constantly surging. There was a destructive tearing force that rushed towards Lu Ming. Wounds appeared on Lu Ming’s arm, but under the effect of rhe life law, they healed quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming bombarded the fifth heavenly domain crazily.</p><p>Finally, when the seventh layer of heaven was stacked, Lu Ming finally blew up the fifth layer of heaven.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming ignored his injuries and attacked crazily. He fought against rhe heavenly Tribulation and blew up one heavenly domain after another.</p><p>Behind him, the Hunyuan heavenly realm and the taiqing heavenly realm were formed one by one, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was coughing out blood. His arm was about to explode. He was severely injured.</p><p>if not for the life law, he would have been suppressed by the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>However, in rhe end, Lu Ming blew up the nine Heavens one by one.</p><p>As the nine Heavens disappeared, Lu Ming’s injuries were healing rapidly. His body and Saint energy had even become stronger and tempered.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming discovered that his usage of the law had become stronger.</p><p>He was especially adept at using the Laws of Chaos and death. The two laws became weaker when they collided, but their power increased.</p><p>In the process of transcending rhe Tribulation, Lu Ming’s abilities were constantly increasing.</p><p>he’s passed it. Lu Ming has passed the eighth major tribulation!</p><p>“Dao vindication and Emperor, did he succeed?”</p><p>The scene was noisy. Some were excited, some were unhappy, and some were pale.</p><p>However, in the next moment, all the sounds disappeared.</p><p>That was because the Tribulation clouds had yer to dissipate.</p><p>On the contrary, ir surged even more violently and let out a terrifying roar.</p><p>Everyone shut their mouths and looked ar the Tribulation clouds in the sky.</p><p>Could it be that the heavenly Tribulation was not over yet? There’s still a ninth lightning tribulation?</p><p>Nine lightning tribulations, this was unheard of!</p><p>“Nine-layered lightning tribulation, it s actually nine-layered lightning tribulation, how is this possible? Wasn’t this the legendary Heavenly Tribulation that would only occur when one broke through the Supreme realm? Why did it appear on Lu Ming?”</p><p>Dandan murmured. She was also dumbfounded, and then she was filled with endless worry.</p><p>He had lived for a long time and knew some secrets that most people didn’t.</p><p>hahaha, there’s still the ninth lightning tribulation. He almost died at the eighth lightning tribulation. He definitely won’t be able to pass the ninth!</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others from the Heng Xing River were overjoyed.</p><p>Originally, they had all given up hope, but now, they were reinvigorated..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
