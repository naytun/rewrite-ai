Did brother Lu kill them? ”</p><p>He had clearly seen it but pretended not to see it. He wanted to test Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, I just got here too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, don’t tell me that someone has already entered that small world? Then let’s hurry in too!”</p><p>The LAN family’s leader pretended to have a change in expression. He strode forward and approached Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying ray of light burst out from the hands of the leader of the LAN family and headed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were very close. If Lu Ming was not on guard, he would definitely not be able to Dodge.</p><p>However, just as the LAN family’s leader made his move, the six-feathered wings suddenly appeared on Lu Ming’s back. In a flash, Lu Ming’s figure flew away at top speed, avoiding the opponent’s attack.</p><p>The leader of the LAN family’s expression changed. He looked gloomy as he stared at Lu Ming.”How did you find out?”</p><p>“You’re good at disguising yourself, but the others aren’t so good at it. If someone wants to kill me, do you think 1 won’t notice? Who are you people?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was a little gloomy.</p><p>If not for his extremely sharp senses and the fact that there were people from the LAN and Yan families with strong killing intent, Lu Ming would have caught them despite their efforts to conceal it.</p><p>“So what if I’m discovered by you? you’ll still die today. Attack!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted. He no longer concealed himself and unleashed his full power, charging towards Lu Ming. He displayed extremely terrifying combat strength.</p><p>“Rank 17 true Emperor battle power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength had barely reached the fourteenth stage of the true Emperor realm, he was still far from the seventeenth stage of the true Emperor realm. He was not a match for them at all.</p><p>Moreover, there were other people.</p><p>The other members of the LAN family and Yan family also made their moves. Each of them had shocking battle strength and were all above the tenth level of true Emperor.</p><p>If the celestial Thearch’s physical body was still around, these people would not be a threat to him. However, Lu Ming was no match for them now.</p><p>Lu Ming cast his six-feathered divine wings and retreated rapidly to avoid the attack. At the same time, the fallen star bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>One attack after another streaked across the void and headed straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Are you from the LAN and Yan families?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The moment the other party made a move, he could not hide his unique magical ability and Lu Ming recognized it.</p><p>Due to his enmity with the LAN family and the Yan family, Lu Ming had studied the ancient scriptures and divine abilities passed down by these two families. That was why he could recognize them at a glance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The LAN family and Yan family members shouted, their killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As Lu Ming retreated, he drew the fallen star bow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An arrow shot out at an extreme speed, tearing through the void like a star.</p><p>One of the LAN family’s rank-15 true Emperor powerhouses was shot to death in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted and increased his speed to the maximum. It was as if he was traveling through the void. His speed was at its maximum, not slower than Lu Ming’s six-feathered divine wings.</p><p>There was another person from the Yan family who was also a rank 17 true Emperor. They worked together with the person from the LAN family and charged toward Lu Ming from both sides, closing in on him quickly.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming drew his bow continuously. Two nine-colored arrows were shot at two people with the combat power of a rank 17 true Emperor. However, a rank 17 true Emperor was really powerful. He blocked the arrows with brute force and only his figure was hindered.</p><p>a level 17 true Emperor is this strong? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re dead meat today. Hand over the indestructible ancient scroll and the ancient scroll that you’re cultivating, and we’ll give you a quick death!” The leader of the LAN family said coldly.</p><p>However, at this moment, his expression changed.</p><p>The other members of the LAN family and Yan family also changed their expressions.</p><p>That was because there was a flash of light in the distance. Someone was coming.</p><p>The LAN and Yan families stopped in their tracks.</p><p>That was because there was a rule in the heaven realm that no one was allowed to kill each other on the battlefield. If anyone violated this rule, even the LAN and Yan families would be punished.</p><p>The rainbow light receded, and a total of six people appeared not far away.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A voice rang out.</p><p>“Senior Bai tai!”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He did not expect that one of them would be Bai tai.</p><p>With Bai Tai’s cultivation level, shouldn’t he be active in the periphery of the true Emperor battlefield? How did he end up in the core of the battlefield of true emperors?</p><p>“Could it be because of that small world?”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>“Everyone, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Bai tai looked at the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>Just now, from afar, they seemed to have seen someone fighting here.</p><p>Then, Bai tai and the others looked at the alien’s body and their faces changed.</p><p>Could it be that the LAN family and the Yan family were fighting against the foreign races?</p><p>At this moment, the leader of the LAN family had a gloomy expression and a flash of killing intent.</p><p>“Attack and kill these people together!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN clan transmitted his voice to the others.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed. If word got out that they killed their own people on the battlefield, the LAN and Yan families wouldn’t be able to protect them. But now, there was no one else present. They just had to kill them to silence them.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN clan transmitted his voice.</p><p>“Not good! Senior Bai tai, run!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted loudly. He could feel the murderous aura exuding from the LAN family and the rest.</p><p>These people were so audacious that they wanted to kill Bai tai and the others.</p><p>As Lu Ming roared, he rushed towards Bai tai at top speed.</p><p>However, the Yan family’s rank 17 true Emperor had already charged at Bai tai.</p><p>At the same time, the leader of the LAN family charged at Lu Ming and launched a series of attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming could only try his best to Dodge. He was not in a hurry to rescue her.</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>Bai tai was shocked. He didn’t expect that the LAN and Yan families would suddenly attack them.</p><p>Bai Tai’s combat strength was only at the seventh stage true Emperor realm. He was no match for the other party. His heart was pierced through by the other party’s attack. The terrifying power caused Bai Tai’s body to explode.</p><p>“Senior Bai tai…”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned red and he revealed a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>He and Bai tai had worked together to hunt for alien races for two years and fought dozens of battles. They had formed a deep friendship.</p><p>Bai tai, his ancestor, had all died in the hands of the alien races. His biggest wish in his life was to hunt the alien races. He had no other intentions.</p><p>At the same time, he knew that his talent was limited. When he was hunting the alien races, he would deliberately give more world cores to Lu Ming so that Lu Ming could improve faster.</p><p>It could be said that this was a respectable old man who had spent his entire life hunting foreign races. But now, he had died under the greed of the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with cold killing intent. At this moment, he could not wait to kill everyone from the LAN and Yan families.</p><p>“LAN family, you will all die a horrible death!”</p><p>“All!”</p><p>The people who came with Bai tai were all killed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no one can save you. Die!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family kept launching attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the others also flew toward Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
