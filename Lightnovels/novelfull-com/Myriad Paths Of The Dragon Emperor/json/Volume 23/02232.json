Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>“The Laws of Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense the fluctuation of the chaos laws in the fist force. Without thinking, Lu Ming struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and the fist force collided heavily. The void exploded and trembled continuously. A strong wind swept in all directions.</p><p>Xingxing river’s body trembled and was swept away by the aftershock. He spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the sky.</p><p>A burly figure stepped through the air and looked down at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yuan Xin!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>It was a coincidence that he met old acquaintances from the primordial realm today.</p><p>the Laws of Chaos. That’s yuan Xin, the son of chaos from the primordial realm!</p><p>I’ve heard of him before. He’s very talented. After coming to the heaven realm, he was immediately accepted as a disciple by a top master. He received a lot of resources and made rapid progress. Some time ago, he defeated several famous heaven’s pride experts in the heaven realm!</p><p>I’ve also heard of him. This person’s talent is indeed amazing. He has the potential to compete with the nine-Jue in the future!</p><p>this time, the primordial realm has indeed produced many people with shocking talent. Besides Yuan Xin, there’s one more person who’s even more terrifying. He was born to be the son of fate and can control the nomological laws of fate!</p><p>“There are also a few paragons from the archaic system who are also extremely terrifying!”</p><p>Clearly, five years had passed, and the prodigies who had come to the primordial realm were all rising rapidly. They had made a name for themselves in the heaven realm and were known by many experts in the heaven realm.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes glowed as he looked down at Lu Ming. A strong fighting spirit emanated from his body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to come to the heaven realm. Although you can’t become a divine Emperor, your combat strength has reached this level. It’s really shocking. But this is good. I’ll feel more when I kill you!”</p><p>As she spoke, Yuan Xin’s eyes revealed a hint of ferocity.</p><p>do you remember what 1 said to you in the ten lands battle? if you are defeated by me once, you will never be my opponent!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke indifferently, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>you’re talking big. A cripple can never become a saint Emperor. Where did you get your confidence from? ”</p><p>die! Yuan Xin shouted coldly as a shocking aura erupted from his body.</p><p>A four-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>This was Yuan Xin’s current cultivation!</p><p>A four-star void Emperor was already a high-level void Emperor, which was much stronger than a three-star void Emperor.</p><p>The powerful power of the world was surging, and the power of nomological laws surrounded Yuan Xin, making her look like a god of War.</p><p>three types of laws, the Laws of Chaos. He’s already at the second realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He had a rough estimate of Yuan Xin’s combat strength.</p><p>“Do you still have confidence now?”</p><p>Yuan Xin said, full of confidence.</p><p>To him, meeting Lu Ming today was great news.</p><p>During the battle of the ten lands, he had been defeated by Tianming and Lu Ming one after another. He was still brooding over it.</p><p>Today, he could defeat Lu Ming. Another day, he would defeat Tianming. He wanted to prove to everyone that he was the number one heaven’s favorite in Yuan continent.</p><p>In the future, he would defeat the strongest heaven’s favorite in the heaven realm and stand at the peak.</p><p>This was his ambition.</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s ours!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded. In the distance, a few rainbow lights flew over at high speed.</p><p>The next moment, a few figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>The powerful aura and cold killing intent were not concealed at all as they pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“LAN Yun, Yan Xi!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>It seemed that he had met a few old acquaintances. They were LAN Yun and Yan Xi.</p><p>When the two of them looked at Lu Ming, their gazes were particularly cold.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>LAN Yun coldly spoke.</p><p>Back then, he was so badly abused by dandan because of Lu Ming. Later on, he did not get the treasure because Lu Ming stopped him.</p><p>Then, the two of them glanced at dandan and Mu Lan. Their eyes were filled with cold killing intent and, of course, greed.</p><p>They recognized Mu Lan.</p><p>Back then, there was a small Pagoda above Mu Lan’s head. It was definitely a Supreme treasure.</p><p>Today, since he had met her, he would take her together!</p><p>They were overjoyed.</p><p>This wasn’t a battlefield, so there weren’t many rules. It was normal to kill each other.</p><p>“You guys, surround those people!”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted and waved his hand.</p><p>Following behind LAN Yun and Yan Xi were a few middle-aged men. At this moment, their figures flashed and they surrounded dandan, Mu Lan and Gu yingzhong.</p><p>These middle-aged men were all at the true Emperor realm. Their terrifying aura made Mu Lan and Gu yingzhong’s expression turn serious. However, their faces darkened and their eyes flickered with an ominous light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll see who can save you today!”</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi’s figures flashed and they surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, it seems that you have offended many people!”</p><p>Yuan Xin sneered.</p><p>“A bunch of clowns!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted, his aura even colder.</p><p>After a few years, LAN Yun and Yan Xi had undoubtedly become stronger. Their cultivations had both reached the level of four-star void Emperor, and their nomological laws had also improved. On the surface, they did not seem to be weaker than Yuan Xin.</p><p>The three young experts had Lu Ming surrounded.</p><p>this trash from the primordial realm has actually offended so many people? ”</p><p>“He’s too overconfident. He’s just a cripple who can never become a saint Emperor. How dare he be so arrogant? isn’t he courting death?”</p><p>I heard that he’s very famous in the yuan continent. He was the first among the younger generation in the yuan continent!</p><p>that’s normal. He’s not a Saint Emperor yet, but he’s already mastered so many laws. His combat power must be very strong. Unfortunately, he doesn’t have the potential to become a saint Emperor. I think he’s used to being arrogant, so he doesn’t recognize his own situation!</p><p>the others can keep improving, but he’s still so arrogant. He doesn’t have much time left. He’s probably going to die today!</p><p>Some people discussed and felt that Lu Ming would definitely die today.</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and Yuan Xin were all much stronger than Xing Chen.</p><p>Now that the three of them were clearly going against Lu Ming, did he still have a chance?</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a joyful voice was heard. The voice was crisp and pleasant to the ears. Then, there was a flash in the void and a figure suddenly appeared on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ming did not avoid it because he knew who it was the moment he heard the voice.</p><p>Bubbles!</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out, a smile on his face.</p><p>It seemed that bubbles had arrived as well!</p><p>It had been five years since they last met, but bubbles was still the same as before. She did not grow much older and still looked like she was two or three years old.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s neck and its small head rubbed against Lu Ming’s body. It was reluctant to let go.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s eyes turned grim when she saw bubbles approaching.</p><p>Bubbles was a space-time spirit mouse. Ever since she came to the heaven realm, she had been placed in an important position and was greatly nurtured. Her cultivation base had improved even more rapidly, and her current strength was no weaker than his..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
