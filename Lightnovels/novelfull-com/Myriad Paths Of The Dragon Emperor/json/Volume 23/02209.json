Jian feiliu also briefly explained his experience.</p><p>It turned out that when Jian feiliu’s cultivation was crippled and he was on the verge of death, he was taken away by a mysterious man after entering the blood pool. That mysterious man was his master, the grey-robed elder, the evil swordsman that dandan had mentioned.</p><p>According to what Jian feiliu said, the passageway to the divine wilderness’s Nine Dragons city had already cracked a little. Evil swordsman had brought Jian feiliu here from the blood pool to cleanse his meridians and marrow before cultivating evil swordsman’s unique sword Dao.</p><p>The cultivation conditions for evil swordsman’s unique sword Dao were very strange. When Jian feiliu’s cultivation was crippled, it just so happened to fit evil swordsman’s unique sword Dao.</p><p>All these years, he had been cultivating here with evil swordsman, and his cultivation had progressed at a lightning speed. Now, he was already a two-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Evil swordsman was definitely a very powerful existence. In ancient times, he knew dandan and was able to participate in the Great War back then and survive. This was enough to show his strength. It was normal for Jian feiliu to improve so quickly under the guidance of such an expert and in the heaven realm, which was a good cultivation environment.</p><p>“Senior Sister Mu Lan, what’s going on with her?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to Mu Lan.</p><p>six years ago, master saved miss Mu Lan at the entrance of the passage. Miss Mu Lan resonated with the inheritance of a friend of master by chance and inherited that senior’s inheritance. Five years have passed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Five years? You’re saying that Senior Sister Mu Lan has been like this for five years?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right. According to master’s speculation, miss Mu Lan should be waking up soon!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He was prepared to wait here for Mu Lan to wake up.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming and dandan stayed here. Time passed day by day.</p><p>The taiqing heavenly region was adjacent to the Hunyuan heavenly region. The passageway between the two heavenly regions had long become a battlefield.</p><p>The two worlds had been fighting for many years and countless bones had been buried.</p><p>On one side of the battlefield was the Tai Qing heavenly region. The two world city was situated there, blocking the entrance to the Tai Qing heavenly region.</p><p>On the other side of the battlefield was the territory that the evil god tribe had occupied.</p><p>There were many strange and malevolent-looking buildings here, and countless powerful beings of the evil god race were gathered here.</p><p>Within one of the buildings, a group of evil god race members were having a meeting.</p><p>Most of the evil god tribe members were covered in purple scales, and only a few of them were covered in black scales. Each and every one of them had extremely terrifying auras, and they were all terrifying experts.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there was a member of the evil god tribe at the very top. This member of the evil god tribe’s body was almost the same size as a normal human, but he was slightly taller than a human. He was about two meters tall, and there were no scales on his body. However, there was a third eye in the middle of his brows. He had a head full of purple hair, and he was extremely eye-catching.</p><p>This was the Royal clan of the evil god tribe!</p><p>the patriarch has sent another message. The passage is not completely sealed, and there is still hope of breaking it. Therefore, this time, we must break the passage no matter what!</p><p>once we have that passage, our Army can go straight to the primordial realm. Then, through the primordial realm, we can enter the taiqing heavenly region and destroy the heaven and Yuan worlds in one fell swoop!</p><p>“You guys, send your men into the battlefield!”</p><p>The Royal member of the evil god tribe gave the order.</p><p>“Yes, at all costs!”</p><p>The members of the evil god tribe acknowledged the order. Not long after, many figures flew towards the battlefield, towards the ancient battlefield where Lu Ming and the others were.</p><p>There was no lack of great emperors among them.</p><p>The heavenly Emperor realm figures did not dare to enter, because once they entered, they would attract all the marks and be hunted down by all the marks.</p><p>Unless one’s cultivation was at a certain level and not weaker than those peerless experts in the past, they would not be afraid of those marks, such as the few old ancestors of the evil god race.</p><p>Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been cultivating while waiting for Mu Lan to wake up.</p><p>One day, while Lu Ming was cultivating, a shadow flashed in the cave and a figure appeared. It was evil swordsman.</p><p>Evil swordsman hadn’t shown up in the last half a month.</p><p>According to Jian feiliu, his master was severely injured in the ancient battle. He was lucky that he didn’t die. His cultivation and battle strength were no longer what they used to be. He had been in seclusion to heal his injuries all these years.</p><p>Why did he suddenly appear now?</p><p>Evil swordsman raised his head and looked at the sky. He seemed to have a lot on his mind, and after a long time, he sighed, it seems that the passage hasn’t completely collapsed or been sealed. It can still be opened!</p><p>“A passageway?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but feel worried when he heard that. He asked,” “Senior, the passage you mentioned, do you mean the passage that leads to the primordial realm?”</p><p>that’s right, little guy. You must have come here from the primordial realm through that passage, right?”</p><p>Evil sword guest said.</p><p>that’s right, senior. Could it be that the evil god tribe is going to enter the primordial realm through that passageway? ”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming was extremely worried and his heart was in his mouth.</p><p>If the evil god tribe were to enter the primordial realm through that passageway, the divine wilderness continent would be finished.</p><p>“It’s not that easy, you guys see!”</p><p>Evil swordsman waved his hand, and an image immediately appeared in the air.</p><p>Many figures shuttled through the air. They were all members of the evil god race.</p><p>Suddenly, light filled the air, and a figure appeared.</p><p>It was the mark of a peerless expert.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The moment the mark of this unparalleled expert appeared, his killing intent soared into the sky. Wielding a long spear, he pierced through the void and instantly killed seven to eight evil god race members. After that, the long spear swept out once more, and a terrifying figure exploded in the air.</p><p>“That is … The evil god race at the Emperor realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The last member of the evil god race that had been blown up was definitely at the great emperor realm. However, he was still unable to block the attack from the mark of the expert.</p><p>“Spread out!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members roared and flew in all directions. The mark of that peerless expert continued to Pierce out with the long spear, killing a few of the evil god tribe’s experts. However, the rest of the evil god tribe managed to escape.</p><p>this is just a corner. This time around, many experts from the evil god tribe have entered, and there are no lack of great emperor realm figures. Their goal is that passageway. Look again!</p><p>Then, evil swordsman waved his hand again, and the scene changed again.</p><p>On the screen, a void appeared.</p><p>The space in that area was extremely unstable. From time to time, a spatial crack would appear and disappear. It was extremely ferocious and terrifying.</p><p>Not far away in the void, there were many figures standing in the air. All of them were powerful beings from the evil god tribe.</p><p>some of the evil god race members were attacking the unstable void, and some of them were setting up arrays.</p><p>“Could this be the passageway from before?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“That’s right, this is the entrance to that passage. An astonishing battle took place there, and the passage was destroyed, but it wasn’t completely sealed. There’s still hope of opening it!”</p><p>Evil sword guest said.</p><p>“Senior, what’s going on? Why is there a passage here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled and he felt more and more anxious..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
