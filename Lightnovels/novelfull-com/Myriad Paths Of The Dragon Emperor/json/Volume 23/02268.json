When the three members of the evil god race were close enough, Bai tai made his move.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Bai tai seemed to have transformed into a divine sword. He became one with the sword and pierced through the void. He charged out and aimed at the vital point of a burly evil god.</p><p>“There’s an ambush!”</p><p>kill! one of the evil god race members shouted. The evil god race member who had been ambushed by Bai tai took out a battle axe and slashed at Bai tai.</p><p>B0x𝔫oѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At the critical moment, Bai Tai’s sword changed its momentum. The original sword light split into eight sword lights and attacked the other party.</p><p>Although the other party had blocked six of the sword lights, two of them still landed on his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The evil god tribe member was sent flying, and his body was almost sliced into a few pieces. His scales flew in all directions, and two deep wounds appeared on his body, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>“It’s equivalent to a sixth stage true Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He determined the combat strength of the evil god tribe member who had been injured by Bai tai.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Bai tai wanted to kill this member of the evil god race in one go. However, the other two members of the evil god race had already made their move and were charging towards Bai tai.</p><p>The two members of the evil god tribe had astonishing combat strength. Bai tai did not dare to be careless and could only stop defending.</p><p>The three of them exchanged a few blows, and Bai tai was sent flying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two members of the evil god race charged toward Bai tai. Bai tai unleashed his full power and fought with them. For a moment, he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“A seventh stage true Emperor and a sixth stage true Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming estimated the combat strength of the two remaining evil god tribe members.</p><p>One of them had the same combat strength as Bai tai.</p><p>With the two of them working together, Bai tai was at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, Bai tai was focused on defense, so he would not be defeated for the time being.</p><p>At this moment, the injured member of the evil god race struggled to his feet. With a ferocious look on his face, he charged toward Bai tai.</p><p>“A sixth stage true Emperor, I’d like to try!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a trace of fighting spirit and rushed over.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Lu Ming condensed a long spear in his hands. Nine types of laws were intertwined inside.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He turned into a bolt of lightning and charged toward the injured evil god tribe member.</p><p>“Void Emperor!”</p><p>Sensing Lu Ming’s aura, the evil god tribe member was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Then, he revealed a ferocious killing intent and said,” “An illusionary divine dares to attack me? kill!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a destructive light burst out of his third eye. The destructive light turned into a combat sword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his long spear and it collided with the combat sword.</p><p>With a clang, the combat sword was sent flying. Lu Ming’s body froze for a moment before he continued to charge forward.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>The evil god race was shocked.</p><p>Initially, he thought that Lu Ming was merely an illusionary Thearch. No matter how strong his combat strength was, he could solve the problem with one move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could actually send his attack flying with one move. He was shocked beyond words.</p><p>genius, he’s definitely a peerless genius. Kill him!</p><p>The injured evil god tribe member’s eyes burned with passion. He held a battle axe and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all as he charged towards the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two of them collided and a terrifying force gushed out from the battle-ax. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying. His arms were full of wounds, but under the effect of the indestructible ancient scroll, they quickly healed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure stopped for a moment before he charged at the other party.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members roared in rage and unleashed their terrifying attacks.</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row. Lu Ming was no match for him. He was hit by the other party’s destructive light and a wound appeared on his body.</p><p>However, the muscles on the wound quickly wriggled and healed at an astonishing speed.</p><p>what a powerful force. As expected of a sixth stage true Emperor. Fortunately, the other party is injured!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>If he was at his peak, Lu Ming would be in danger even if he had the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>However, he had just been injured by Bai Tai’s sneak attack and his combat power had been greatly reduced. At most, he was only slightly stronger than a fifth stage true Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming could still withstand such combat strength.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about his injuries and charged at the other party.</p><p>The two of them continued to exchange blows. Lu Ming was at a complete disadvantage and was constantly injured by his opponent. However, under the effect of the indestructible ancient scroll, he would recover very quickly.</p><p>Even if he were to fight, his injuries would heal quickly.</p><p>“Monster, this monster!”</p><p>The evil god tribe members revealed a look of fear. Lu Ming was like an unkillable monster.</p><p>death law, array Dao law, break through, break through for me!</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. In the fierce battle, Lu Ming once again saw the aura of a breakthrough. The nine types of laws were being circulated to the extreme by Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s strength increased by a notch and he swept away the other party’s attack with one move.</p><p>I’ve broken through! It’s array Dao laws!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>His array Dao laws had finally broken through to the second realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s array Dao had broken through to the second realm. His combat strength had undoubtedly increased by a few points.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Rays of spear radiance pierced towards the other party.</p><p>“He actually broke through? so what if he broke through? he’s still going to die. Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s expert was enraged. He disregarded his injuries and unleashed a storm of attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming tried his best to fight against the other party. Although he was still at a disadvantage, his situation was better than before.</p><p>law of death, law of death!</p><p>Lu Ming was fully focused, trying to break through the bottleneck of the death rule.</p><p>After another ten or so moves.</p><p>An extremely powerful aura of death suddenly emanated from Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, Lu Ming’s strength increased by a large margin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged another blow with the evil god race. This time, Lu Ming did not retreat. Instead, it was the evil god race that was forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>The law of death, breakthrough!</p><p>Lu Ming’s death rule had officially reached the second realm.</p><p>The death law was an ultimate law and could not be compared to the array Dao law. With the breakthrough and the fusion with the chaos law, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability started to suppress the other party.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The other party roared in disbelief.</p><p>To be able to achieve consecutive breakthroughs in the middle of a battle with him … How could there be such a person? This talent was a little too monstrous.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength and confidence soared. He began to counterattack and his attacks were wild.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Spear’s light enveloped the entire body of the evil god race.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the evil god tribe member’s body, bringing with it a long stream of blood.</p><p>If the evil god tribe was at its peak, it would still be stronger than the current Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had broken through two types of laws in a row and his combat strength had increased greatly, his combat strength did not rise to the combat strength of a sixth stage true Emperor all at once. It was probably at the peak of the fifth stage true Emperor and was still weaker than his opponent.</p><p>However, he was injured by Bai tai and had been fighting with Lu Ming for a long time. His combat strength had weakened and was now weaker than Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attacks were like a storm, charging towards his opponent. He completely ignored his own defense, and the other party was even more outmatched.</p><p>After more than ten moves, half of his body was shattered by Lu Ming. He was severely injured and on the verge of death..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
