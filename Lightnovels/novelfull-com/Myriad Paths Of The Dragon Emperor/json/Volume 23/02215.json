It finally broke through the evil god race’s old ancestor’s attack and charged towards the other party.</p><p>The evil god race’s cultivation method was not a system of laws. It was very similar to the heaven realm’s ancient system. They cultivated a strange power that was extremely powerful and could both attack and defend.</p><p>At this moment, evil swordsman’s sword light had cut it open, leaving a deep sword wound on his body. His scales had been cut open, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor let out a furious roar, and a layer of purple light covered his entire body as he charged towards evil swordsman.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming rode the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and charged over again.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron resonated with each other and crushed down toward the evil god race’s old master.</p><p>The evil god race’s old master waved the weapon in his hands and continued to strike out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron rumbled continuously and was finally blown away.</p><p>However, evil swordsman’s attack arrived again.</p><p>The evil god race’s patriarch was already severely injured, and his combat strength had been greatly reduced. Now that he was being attacked by Lu Ming and evil swordsman, he was at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>The other members of the evil god tribe were shocked!</p><p>If even the evil god race’s old ancestor was no match for it, then how was this passageway supposed to be opened?</p><p>The three experts from two world city were overjoyed!</p><p>It was a pleasant surprise that Lu Ming could control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and burst out with infinite combat strength.</p><p>This gave them a chance to turn the tables.</p><p>However, at this moment, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Because in the distance, there were a few extremely terrifying auras that were spreading towards this side.</p><p>The few of them looked in one direction. Over there, there were three huge demonic shadows, and they were coming over.</p><p>The strength of his aura was not any weaker than that of the evil god tribe’s old ancestor.</p><p>the evil god tribe’s peerless experts! And three of them have come at once!</p><p>The three people from two world city were pale and desperate.</p><p>In the heavenly Emperor realm, there was a huge gap between each level. The gap between each level was huge.</p><p>Only heavenly Emperor powerhouses above the four-star heavenly Emperor realm could be called peerless powerhouses.</p><p>Such a person was already standing at the peak of the world. He was an existence at the top of the pyramid of all living beings, and his power was unbelievable.</p><p>The reason why this ancient battlefield was so terrifying was because there had been a battle between a group of peerless powerhouses in the past. Even the immortal imprints left behind after the death of many peerless powerhouses were extremely terrifying.</p><p>One could only imagine how powerful a peerless expert was.</p><p>Now, there were three of them.</p><p>In the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, Lu Ming and dandan could also sense the situation outside. At this time, their expressions also changed drastically.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. Back then, when he had crossed over from the primordial realm, he had seen the four huge demonic shadows of the evil god tribe fighting against the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It was obvious that they were the four of them.</p><p>“The patriarchs are here!”</p><p>The members of the evil god tribe were overjoyed.</p><p>In order to seize this passageway, the evil god race had made ample preparations. They had first sent a large Army to attack the two world city so that the experts of the heaven realm could not be distracted and come to their aid. They had then opened this passageway.</p><p>When the evil god tribe’s Army entered the primordial realm, the situation would be set.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the distance, an old ancestor of the evil god race roared, causing the void to explode continuously. The scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Evil swordsman also roared in anger. It was already difficult to deal with one of the evil god race’s old ancestors, and now there were three more.</p><p>He could sense that the evil god race’s old ancestor was injured, and his strength was not as strong as before. However, it was still extremely shocking.</p><p>The three demonic shadows came at top speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, at this moment, a violent boom erupted in the distant sky. The void shattered, and a huge hand stretched out from the dark void.</p><p>The hand was incomparably huge, and it emanated the might of the heavenly Dao as it smashed toward the three evil god race’s old ancestors.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The old ancestor of the learning God clan roared and blasted out attacks one after another at the huge hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void was shattered, as if the world had been destroyed and turned back into chaos.</p><p>With a terrifying explosion, the huge hand exploded.</p><p>But then, a figure appeared in that area. This figure was shrouded in divine light, and his appearance couldn’t be seen clearly. One could only roughly sense that he was burly and filled with supreme majesty.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The figure continued to attack, sending out terrifying palm prints that headed toward the three old masters of the evil god race.</p><p>“It’s a peerless expert from our heaven realm!”</p><p>The three experts from two world city were ecstatic.</p><p>In the end, a peerless expert from the heaven realm had arrived.</p><p>The old ancestor of the evil god race was injured in the end. Right now, the three of them were being suppressed by a peerless expert from the heaven realm.</p><p>The three of them were extremely unwilling and let out angry roars. If they were at their peak, they wouldn’t be weaker than the other party. Unfortunately, they were all injured, and their strength had been greatly reduced. That was why they were so aggrieved. The three of them were suppressed by the other party.</p><p>“You go kill them. Leave this person to the two of us!”</p><p>At this moment, one of the evil god race’s old masters roared as the light on his body grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>Two of the evil god race’s old ancestors were going all out. They ignored their injuries and forcefully raised their combat strength to the peak, killing their way toward the peerless experts of the heaven realm.</p><p>The three of them collided in a terrifying manner and fought their way into the depths of the dark void.</p><p>The remaining evil god tribe’s old ancestor charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Ants, die!”</p><p>die! the evil god race’s old master roared and reached out with a palm. A terrifying radiance emanated from his palm as he grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>From a distance, the terrifying pressure pressed on the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, making it buzz and shake.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and blasted it at the other party.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron collided with the opponent’s attack. It kept shaking and then was sent flying one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan, who were hiding in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, were also shaken violently. Their qi and blood were boiling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The evil god race’s old master charged over. His massive body started to shrink, and in the end, he became the size of a normal human.</p><p>This old master of the evil god tribe did not look much different from a human. He had a head full of purple hair and was extremely handsome.</p><p>The only difference was that there was a third eye between his eyebrows.</p><p>This was a royal member of the evil god tribe.</p><p>The Royal race of the evil god race was too powerful. Even though they were injured, their combat strength was still extremely terrifying.</p><p>His entire body was enveloped in a layer of purple light. The third eye between his brows glowed, and nine sparkling and resplendent combat swords actually flew out, slashing towards the nine divine cauldrons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The combat sword continued to slash at the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, causing sparks to fly and the cauldron to shake.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan were hiding in that cauldron, surrounded by the other eight cauldrons. Even though they were separated by layers of defense, the other party’s terrifying power still gushed in, causing Lu Ming to vomit blood.</p><p>Dandan’s cultivation level was higher, so it was better.</p><p>The situation was not good for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>If this continued, even if they were separated by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, they would still be shocked to death by the other party.</p><p>The main reason was that the difference in cultivation was too great.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation was at the true Emperor realm, the situation would be much better.</p><p>awaken! Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, channeling the qi and blood in his body with all his might, making his qi and blood boil even more..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
