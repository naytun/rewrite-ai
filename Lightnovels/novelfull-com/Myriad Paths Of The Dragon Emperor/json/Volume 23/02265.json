He stomped his foot and a violent force burst out, clashing with the huge hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion. Lu Ming‚Äôs body was blasted high into the sky like a cannonball. He felt a sharp pain coming from his feet and it was almost split open.</p><p>B0xùî´ùô§—µùëíùô°.com</p><p>‚ÄúWhat powerful strength!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>When he collided with the claw just now, Lu Ming could feel that the strength of the claw was beyond shocking and far above his.</p><p>Circulating the indestructible ancient scroll, the injuries on his feet quickly healed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the ground, gravel flew everywhere as a burly member of the evil god race appeared.</p><p>The evil god was covered in purple scales and had an unusually burly figure. He was four meters tall and held a thick iron rod as he stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The evil god race member stomped heavily, causing the rocks on the ground to crack. He then soared into the sky, raised his metal rod, and smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The iron rod grew rapidly, like a mountain range, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The void kept exploding, stirring up endless space storms.</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs pupils contracted sharply. At this moment, Lu Ming did not hold back at all. He exerted his cultivation to the extreme.</p><p>A long spear appeared in his hand. It was the divine power-infinite Dragon Spear. It contained nine nomological laws.</p><p>The power of the world gushed into the infinite Dragon Spear in a frenzy. Lu Ming swept his spear out as well, turning it into a shocking spear radiance that collided with the iron rod.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void rippled like water, and then exploded continuously, stretching for thousands of miles.</p><p>Then, a figure was sent flying.</p><p>It was Lu Ming!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming‚Äôs arm was covered in cracks, looking extremely ferocious.</p><p>This was due to the conflicting laws. However, more importantly, the terrifying power of the other party surged over and injured Lu Ming.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had used all his strength and cast the divine ability composed of nine types of laws, he was still no match for the other party. He was sent flying and injured by the other party.</p><p>One must know that when Lu Ming attacked, he had already activated the inextinguishable golden body. His entire body‚Äôs defensive power was astonishing, but he was still injured. It was clear how powerful the other party‚Äôs skills were.</p><p>the power that the evil god race cultivates is so strange. It‚Äôs not a law, but its offensive power is extremely shocking. It can even break through laws!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>he sensed that the evil god race‚Äôs cultivation was rather similar to the ancient cultivation system.</p><p>For example, the power cultivated by the immemorial demonic Dao and the immemorial demonic Dao was extremely pure, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>‚ÄúAn illusionary divine actually managed to block one of my moves and not die!‚Äù</p><p>The evil god tribe member‚Äôs eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>this person must be a peerless heaven‚Äôs favorite from the heaven realm. He must be killed!</p><p>Then, he became excited, and a ferocious killing intent emanated from him. He took a step in the air and charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>‚ÄúKill!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming did not back down and charged at the other party.</p><p>Although the other party‚Äôs combat strength was stronger than his, it was not too ridiculous that he could not kill him in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid as long as he could not kill him in one move. He had the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll and the injuries he had just suffered had already healed. Lu Ming was still in his peak condition.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the nine types of laws, his physical strength, and the world Energy to the extreme. He waved the infinite Dragon Spear and fought with his opponent.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>After two consecutive moves, Lu Ming was sent flying again. The bones in his body made a cracking sound and blood seeped out of his mouth.</p><p>However, his injuries were recovering at an astonishing speed. In just a breath‚Äôs time, he had recovered more than half of his injuries.</p><p>This was the terrifying aspect of the indestructible ancient scroll. Its recovery effect was not something that a single life law could compare to.</p><p>‚ÄúAgain!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>Pressure! He finally felt the pressure!</p><p>On the battlefield of the empty Emperor, it was impossible to have such a thing. The battlefield of the true Emperor was indeed extraordinary. As soon as he entered, he encountered such a terrifying opponent.</p><p>However, this was also the best training target for Lu Ming to do his best in the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and rushed toward the other party.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight.</p><p>In terms of attack power, Lu Ming was no match for him. Every time he was blasted away and injured by the other party, he could heal quickly at an alarming speed.</p><p>‚ÄúMonster, this monster!‚Äù</p><p>The evil god tribe members roared, and their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>‚ÄúKill!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss. His aura was like a rainbow as he continuously charged at his opponent, as if he was not afraid of death.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming‚Äôs hair stood on end. He felt a fatal danger.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ground exploded and a figure charged out at an astonishing speed towards Lu Ming. At the same time, a few black lights slashed at Lu Ming‚Äôs head at an even more terrifying speed.</p><p>They were sharp blades that could easily cut through space.</p><p>‚ÄúDanger, extreme danger!‚Äù</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming‚Äôs mind. At the critical moment, he waved the infinite Dragon Spear and blocked the two sharp blades.</p><p>Zzzzzzz‚Ä¶</p><p>The sharp blade hit the infinite Dragon Spear and made an ear-piercing sound. The infinite Dragon Spear was completely formed by the power of the world and nine types of laws. However, at this moment, the laws shook and were cut by the sharp blade, almost cutting the infinite Dragon Spear in two.</p><p>Fortunately, the two blades were blocked. However, there was still a third one!</p><p>Yes, there was a third blade that was aimed at Lu Ming‚Äôs neck.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He used the six-feathered divine wings and retreated quickly.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered in all directions. Although Lu Ming had avoided being hit in his vital parts, his chest was still cut by the sharp blade. A deep wound appeared and blood flowed freely. His body was almost cut in half.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the indestructible ancient scroll. The wound squirmed rapidly and sealed itself automatically, healing rapidly.</p><p>‚ÄúThis is‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally saw the evil god race that had attacked him.</p><p>This evil god race member had an extremely peculiar appearance. He was very different from the evil god race that Lu Ming had seen in the past.</p><p>Although this evil god tribe member was covered in purple scales, he was extremely small and was only about a meter tall. However, the most peculiar thing about him was that he actually had four arms.</p><p>It had four arms, each holding a sharp blade.</p><p>There was also a third eye on the forehead of this evil god tribe member.</p><p>what kind of evil god tribe is this? ‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs heart skipped a beat. In the past, he had never seen such an evil god tribe member.</p><p>an illusionary divine is actually so difficult to deal with. He is definitely a rare heaven‚Äôs favorite. He must be killed, killed!</p><p>A cruel look appeared in the eyes of the thin and small evil god race member. His body trembled and he disappeared from his original spot. In the next moment, Lu Ming felt a terrifying sense of danger from behind.</p><p>Without a second thought, Lu Ming activated his six-feathered divine wings. His transparent wings flapped rapidly and he dodged the attack.</p><p>However, a huge iron rod came crashing down on Lu Ming. The powerful force was so strong that Lu Ming could not breathe.</p><p>It was another member of the evil god tribe who made a move. He aimed at Lu Ming‚Äôs retreating path and launched a move..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
