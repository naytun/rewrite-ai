It twisted and two black shadows emerged from their bodies. Beside them, two figures appeared like shadows.</p><p>“They’ve been possessed!”</p><p>One of the elders spoke.</p><p>They hadn’t been betrayed. The two of them had been caught by a foreign race when they went out to gather information. Then, they had been possessed by a foreign race and had obtained the address of the entrance to the small world.</p><p>At this moment, the two burly men also came to their senses. When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, they instantly understood that they had been used. They had found the entrance to the small world.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>The two of them roared, and their eyes turned red. They turned around and pounced toward the alien race.</p><p>It was hard for them to accept this.</p><p>However, one of the great emperor realm foreign beings struck out with two palms and killed the two burly men.</p><p>hehehe, remnants of the heaven realm, you still want to escape? kill them, don’t let a single one of them escape!</p><p>One of the great emperor realm foreign beings waved his hand.</p><p>Instantly, the alien army charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>One of the elders roared and charged over first.</p><p>A chaotic battle broke out again. The two sides fought fiercely.</p><p>However, the alien races came from behind. Lu Ming and the rest were no match for them at all.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. He wielded his long spear and slaughtered his way through. The alien races were constantly killed by him. He was bathed in blood, both his and the alien races’.</p><p>He continued to circulate the indestructible ancient scroll, healing his injuries. He was like a killing machine that would never tire.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea how many alien races he had killed, but the number of people around him was decreasing.</p><p>Ren Chan was also severely injured. If not for Lu Ming’s protection, he would have died.</p><p>“We’ll block them and let them rush out. They must rush out!”</p><p>One of the elders roared as his body started to burn like a flame.</p><p>He burned his life source.</p><p>He wasn’t the only one. The other elders, including the great emperor experts, were all burning their life force.</p><p>After burning his life source, his battle power had increased dramatically. They had finally torn open a hole.</p><p>get out! Ren Chan, you must survive!</p><p>An elder roared.</p><p>Ren Chan and Lu Ming were too talented. They could not die Here. They could only rise in the future if they escaped.</p><p>Young people were the hope!</p><p>“Grand elders, elders…”</p><p>Ren Chan cried.</p><p>The others were the same!</p><p>The Grand elders and elders were doing this to protect them. Otherwise, with their own combat strength, they would have a greater chance of getting out.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s nose felt a little sour.</p><p>In the past two years, he had already blended into this small world and had feelings for it.</p><p>But now, he saw with his own eyes that the people he was familiar with were dying one by one in front of his eyes. This was a kind of sorrow.</p><p>“Power, power, I need unparalleled power!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart.</p><p>If he didn’t have the strength, it was foreseeable that if the taiqing heavenly region was breached in the future, the primordial realm would not be spared either. At that time, he would not be able to protect his family, his friends, and his lover.</p><p>This was something he could not accept.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>An elder roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and the others followed suit, roaring and charging toward the gap.</p><p>“Stop them!”</p><p>The experts of the foreign races attacked crazily, but they were blocked by the doyens.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group of people charged madly towards the road. In front of them, there were a few great emperor-level figures opening the way.</p><p>Along the way, there were still people dying in battle, but they were determined.</p><p>Finally, they broke out of the encirclement. However, the doyens and the other great emperor realm elders had already been drowned out by the foreign races. They could no longer be seen.</p><p>They knew that most of the doyens and elders would not be able to survive.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the distance, the alien races were chasing after them, and the situation was still very dangerous.</p><p>“Where should we go?”</p><p>there are alien races everywhere. No matter where we go, we will die!</p><p>Many people’s faces were pale. Even if they rushed out, they still had no way out.</p><p>“Enter the land of dusk!”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s words were heard by everyone present.</p><p>Many people could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>The land of dusk was the number one forbidden area in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain. It was full of danger, and those who went in would most likely die.</p><p>Previously, a large number of foreign powerhouses had entered the depths of the land of dusk and suffered heavy losses. Even the celestial Thearch had died. Wouldn’t they be courting death if they went in?</p><p>if we try to escape in another direction, we won’t be able to escape. Sooner or later, they will catch up to us. At that time, only death will await us!</p><p>“Only by entering the depths of the land of dusk can we have a chance to survive. Otherwise, we won’t have a chance!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with a firm voice.</p><p>alright, let’s do that. We don’t have time. Charge into the depths of the land of dusk!</p><p>Ren Chan shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The remaining few emperors also made their decision and rushed into the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>Behind them, the foreign races were closing in on them.</p><p>As they fled, they chased and killed, and people kept dying.</p><p>“We’ll bring up the rear!”</p><p>A few great emperors came to the back to stop the alien races.</p><p>The land of dusk was extremely dangerous. It was filled with terrifying killing intent.</p><p>However, due to the attack of the foreign tribes, the structure of the terrain had been changed. There were traces of fighting the WA-wah everywhere, and the energy of the field had disappeared.</p><p>They had followed the path opened up by the alien race. Otherwise, they would have died under that field energy.</p><p>They charged all the way into the land of dusk.</p><p>However, after charging for a while, they encountered another group of foreign races.</p><p>This road was also guarded by alien races.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, the alien races roared and charged over.</p><p>There were strong enemies in front and pursuers behind.</p><p>Now, there was only one battle left.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead. His glabella glowed, and the celestial Thearch’s physical body flew out.</p><p>Now, he had no choice but to use the celestial Emperor corporeal body.</p><p>Fortunately, in the past few years, Lu Ming would store energy for the celestial Thearch’s body whenever he was free.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed so many true Emperor realm alien races and obtained an astonishing amount of their crystals. They were constantly converted into energy for the celestial Emperor’s physical body.</p><p>Over the past two years, the energy stored in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body had reached an astonishing fifty-five percent.</p><p>The power of such rich energy was naturally astonishing and terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming merged into the celestial Thearch’s physical body. The celestial Thearch’s physical body held the combat sword and slashed. A large number of alien races below the great emperor level were instantly killed.</p><p>“Such a powerful puppet!”</p><p>Ren Chan and the others were overjoyed. They had thought that the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was a puppet.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the celestial Thearch’s physical body and took the lead in killing.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s physical body was sturdy and immortal. Lu Ming did not care about defense at all. He only needed to charge forward and kill..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
