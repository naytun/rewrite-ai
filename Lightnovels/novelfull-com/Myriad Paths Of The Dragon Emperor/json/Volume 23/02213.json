They had too few people.</p><p>“Dandan, are we just going to watch? Is there any way 1 can help?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked anxiously.</p><p>Although he had the heavenly Emperor body, it only had a little more than ten percent of its energy. However, the evil god tribe had a bunch of great emperors, and there were many peak great emperors.</p><p>In a great battle like this, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was not of much use at all.</p><p>He was afraid that if he controlled the celestial Thearch corporeal body to go out, the energy would be exhausted in a few moments. At that time, he could only wait for death.</p><p>the difference in our cultivation is too great. We can’t help at all!</p><p>Dandan was also a little anxious. No matter how much he knew, how resourceful he was, and how many tricks he had up his sleeve, he was at his wit’s end.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming thought of something. His eyes lit up and he said, where’s the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron? where did it go? if we have the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, we might be able to help!</p><p>Lu Ming had refined nine drops of Nine Dragons Blood essence and could control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. As long as he could find the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, given his current cultivation level, the power of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron would definitely be shocking.</p><p>“Let’s look around the vicinity!” Dandan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The two immediately concealed their auras and avoided the battlefield, searching nearby.</p><p>Lu Ming was highly focused and sensed carefully.</p><p>However, they didn’t dare to get close to the battlefield and could only search the surrounding area. However, they couldn’t find anything after searching for a long time.</p><p>The two of them did not give up and continued to search.</p><p>When the two of them came to the back of the passage entrance, Lu Ming suddenly sensed something.</p><p>He could feel the blood in his body heating up and circulating faster.</p><p>“There it is, I really sensed it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he looked around.</p><p>This was a messy pile of stones.</p><p>these rocks aren’t natural. They were shattered. Could it be that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was underground and was blasted into the ground? ”</p><p>Dandan guessed.</p><p>The two of them rushed into the rubble. Lu Ming’s feeling was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Dandan’s entire body glowed, and then she transformed into her true form, turning into a huge turtle.</p><p>“I’m digging…”</p><p>The huge turtle began to dig into the ground with its four limbs.</p><p>Immediately, broken stones flew everywhere and large pieces of soil were lifted up.</p><p>Not long after, a piece of metal was exposed.</p><p>it’s really the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This piece of metal was made of the same material as the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Lu Ming could not be mistaken.</p><p>Dandan was also excited and dug madly, using the power of laws. A large area of soil shook and was thrown out.</p><p>Lu Ming also helped by turning the chaos laws into the laws of the earth to help with the excavation.</p><p>Large pieces of soil loosened and flew out.</p><p>The first Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was revealed, followed by the second one, the third one …</p><p>Soon, nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons the size of mountains appeared in their field of vision.</p><p>“The nine dragon veins are gone. No, they are on the Dragon Cauldron …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the place and he noticed something different about the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was originally engraved with a real dragon pattern, but now, there was an additional pattern on it. This pattern was extremely similar to a Dragon’s Vein, and it was extremely lifelike.</p><p>However, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron didn’t seem to have any energy fluctuations. It was like scrap metal.</p><p>Lu Ming was hugging the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, but it did not react at all.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why isn’t there any reaction?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>it should be that the energy has been exhausted. Even the energy of the Dragon vein has been exhausted!</p><p>Dandan said, frowning in deep thought.</p><p>It was conceivable that the previous battle was absolutely brutal. Even the energy of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the nine dragon veins had been exhausted.</p><p>However, the results of the battle were also shocking. The passageway was destroyed, and the old ancestor of the evil god race was severely injured.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve refined the blood essence of the nine Dragons. Let’s try it with your blood!”</p><p>Dandan suddenly said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Blood seeped out of his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered as he slapped the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron continuously, leaving a bloody handprint on each of the nine Cauldrons.</p><p>“Resuscitate!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. The muscles on his body bulged and the blood Qi in his body circulated wildly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body and reverberated through the sky.</p><p>It was the voice of the nine Dragons.</p><p>“There’s someone over there!”</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar spread far and wide, finally alarming the evil god tribe.</p><p>“A few ants, I’ll go and kill him!”</p><p>One of the evil god race members strode toward Lu Ming and the others at an astonishing speed.</p><p>This was a great emperor from the evil god race.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up!”</p><p>Dandan was anxious.</p><p>“Revive!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his blood boiling and the Dragon’s Roar reverberating.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron finally reacted.</p><p>The bloody handprint that Lu Ming left on the divine cauldron glowed and was then absorbed by the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron began to shake and its aura became stronger and stronger.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was starting to recover!</p><p>“Revive!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to roar. The shadow of Nine Dragons appeared above his head, causing the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to shake even more violently.</p><p>At this moment, the evil god tribe’s great emperor had already arrived.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Thearch shouted coldly. A beam of destructive light shot out from between his brows, enveloping Lu Ming and dandan within it.</p><p>“I’m finished, I’m finished!”</p><p>Dandan screamed.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. With a wave of his hand, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron rushed out from the ground and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The destructive light of the evil god tribe’s great emperor slammed onto the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, causing it to tremble violently.</p><p>The destructive light had been blocked.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming pushed out with one hand, and the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron expanded once more, blasting toward the evil god tribe’s Thearch.</p><p>“You ant-like thing, you dare to attack me?”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s great emperor shouted coldly as a beam of light shot out from his glabella once more, blasting towards the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>However, this time around, a Dragon’s Roar rang out from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It was even more powerful than before. With a single shake, it was able to destroy the destructive light of the evil god tribe’s great emperor before continuing on its way.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s great Emperor’s eyes narrowed as a battle axe appeared in his hands. He then swung the axe toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Deafening rumbles resounded through the sky.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was blocked, but the evil god tribe’s great Emperor’s body trembled violently. He couldn’t help but retreat as his face turned pale.</p><p>“What a powerful force, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With his current cultivation, controlling the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had indeed made it more powerful. However, perhaps it had something to do with the self-recovery of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron before. Its power had become even more astonishing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron continued to press down on the other party.</p><p>At the same time, the auras of the other Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, the second Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron flew out. Together with the first Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, it pressed down toward the evil god tribe’s great emperor..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
