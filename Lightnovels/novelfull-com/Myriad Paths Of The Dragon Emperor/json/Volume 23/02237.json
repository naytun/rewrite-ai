Did you get the indestructible ancient scroll?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Don’t ask me, 1 want some time alone!”</p><p>Dandan pulled a long face, extremely depressed and unwilling.</p><p>this guy must have failed, chirp chirp!</p><p>Paoba mocked.</p><p>“Nonsense, how could 1 have failed? I’m telling you, I’m the only one who succeeded, but that old man, the undying venerable Emperor, is vengeful and refuses to pass the indestructible ancient scroll to me. Ah, ah, ah, I’m not willing to accept this, that old man is vengeful and narrow-minded!”</p><p>Dandan shouted as if she had gone mad.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, Gu yingchong and the rest widened their eyes.</p><p>Did dandan really succeed? He passed the test?</p><p>He couldn’t be bragging, right?</p><p>On the side, the others naturally also heard dandan’s words, but they all cast contemptuous looks at dandan.</p><p>If he didn’t pass, then so be it. But he was still bragging as if he knew the undying venerable sovereign.</p><p>No one believed dandan’s words.</p><p>“Why didn’t the undying venerable sovereign teach you the indestructible ancient scroll?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. He really believed that dandan had passed the assessment.</p><p>Dandan was one of the top ten war beasts, the World Turtle. Her previous memories had been completely restored, and her combat strength was shockingly high. If even dandan couldn’t pass the test, then no one could.</p><p>that guy is narrow-minded and narrow-minded. 1 only took something from him in the past. Is there a need to hold a grudge until now?”</p><p>Dandan was very unhappy and gritted her teeth.</p><p>“You took something?”</p><p>Lu Ming understood. This guy definitely took more than a few things. He must have offended the undying Supreme Emperor in the past.</p><p>Around them, the others were even more disdainful. This guy was speaking as if he was speaking the truth.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of something and sent a voice transmission to dandan,” “According to what you’re saying, could it be that the immortal venerable sovereign is still alive?”</p><p>“She’s dead. She’s dead. It’s only my guess that he holds a grudge. Otherwise, why didn’t he give me the indestructible ancient scroll?”</p><p>Dandan pouted and huffed angrily.</p><p>“Dandan, what’s the content of the assessment inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no one has obtained the indestructible ancient scroll. Now, those who have become Saint emperors before the age of 50 will enter the examination. Hurry up!</p><p>The middle-aged puppet urged, as if it didn’t want the people who had entered before to reveal too much of the situation inside.</p><p>“Those who became a Saint Emperor before the age of fifty!”</p><p>The eyes of Gu yingzhong, Mu Lan, and the others all lit up.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The lone Shadow repeated. At this moment, there were already many figures flying towards Mount eternal.</p><p>“Becoming a saint Emperor before fifty, 1 haven’t, so 1 can’t go in? No, let’s go and try!”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind. He did not think much and flew over as well.</p><p>There were a lot of people who became emperors before the age of fifty, more than a thousand of them.</p><p>In the past, during the ten lands battle, there were one to two hundred people in the primordial realm who became emperors before the age of 50.</p><p>As for the heaven realm, whether it was the cultivation environment or the cultivation resources, it was better than the primordial realm. The inheritance was more complete, and it had been more than five years since the battle of the ten lands. Naturally, there were more people who had become emperors.</p><p>Therefore, there were a lot of people in the heaven realm who became emperors at the age of fifty.</p><p>This was only a portion of them. There were definitely more people who hadn’t come yet, or there would be even more.</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming saw Heng Xinghe and Yuan Xin, as well as LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the rest.</p><p>They also saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior, this person hasn’t become a saint Emperor yet. He wants to fish in troubled waters and sneak in!”</p><p>LAN Yun suddenly called out to the middle-aged puppet.</p><p>There was a gloominess in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The middle-aged puppet looked at Lu Ming with a sharp gaze, as if he wanted to see through Lu Ming.</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, and the others sneered.</p><p>How was it possible for Lu Ming to sneak in?</p><p>He would definitely be punished by the middle-aged puppet.</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged puppet’s eyes revealed a look of surprise. It seemed to be very surprised, and then it nodded.”His situation is special. He can go in!”</p><p>Ah?</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Then, they gritted their teeth.</p><p>“These idiots, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out, gloating over her misfortune.</p><p>LAN Yun and the others had unsightly expressions as they gloomily charged into the door of light.</p><p>Lu Ming, bubbles, Mu Lan, Gu yingchong and the rest also entered the light door one after another.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had appeared on a platform.</p><p>At this moment, there were at least a hundred people gathered on the platform.</p><p>In front of the platform, there was a wide road that slanted upwards.</p><p>“Is this place inside mount eternal? does this road lead to the top of the mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, he turned to look in another direction.</p><p>He discovered that there were a total of nine platforms, and in the middle of the platforms was a pitch-black abyss, separated from each other.</p><p>Each platform had a wide path that slanted upwards.</p><p>Nine platforms, nine paths.</p><p>On each platform, there were more than a hundred or a thousand people, divided equally among the nine platforms.</p><p>Bubbles, Mu Lan, and Gu yingchong were all on Lu Ming’s platform.</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the sky. It looked exactly like the middle-aged puppet from before, but it was clearly just an illusion.</p><p>for the first test, you’ll pass as long as you walk to the end of this road. Let’s go!</p><p>The figure spoke, and then disappeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, some people rushed up the road and ran forward, afraid that they would be one step slower and someone else would beat them to it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>However, just as these people were rushing on the road, there was a rumbling sound.</p><p>Above the road, bolts of lightning appeared out of thin air and kept striking towards them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Some people couldn’t resist it and retreated while coughing blood.</p><p>Someone blocked the lightning and continued to move upwards. However, the lightning continued to strike towards the crowd.</p><p>this path is indeed not that simple. Let’s go up!</p><p>Lu Ming said and the few of them rushed on the road.</p><p>This road looked very old, but it was very wide. Hundreds of people could walk side by side without any problem.</p><p>When they stepped onto the ancient road, bolts of lightning appeared out of thin air and struck towards them.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and dispersed the lightning that was striking him.</p><p>“The power of this lightning is very weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised to find that the lightning that struck him was not powerful at all. He had blocked it easily.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles, Gu yingchong, Mu Lan, and the rest had all blocked the lightning.</p><p>“That’s not right. It seems that people of different cultivation bases face different levels of lightning. This test is based on cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered the secret.</p><p>It was obvious that those with higher cultivation levels did not have any advantage here.</p><p>The test here would eliminate one’s cultivation base and adjust the power of the lightning.</p><p>It was impossible to pass by relying on cultivation. One had to rely on talent and combat power that was beyond one’s level.</p><p>It was no wonder that the lightning that struck Lu Ming was not powerful. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was not high to begin with.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stepped forward. They were very relaxed at the beginning..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
