Now that he had become a great emperor, his cultivation level had soared rapidly. He could probably kill them with a single finger.</p><p>When Lu Ming was only a two-star iliusionary Emperor, he was able to beat ou yebing half to death with one move.</p><p>Before Lu Ming had broken through, he was no match for ou yabing. Now that he had broken through, his combat strength had increased by many times.</p><p>“This kid…”</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor, Lan Cheng, the Yan clan s heavenly</p><p>Emperor, and his master from the eternal Star River all had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>There was also a trace of shock in his eyes.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s aura finally stabilized.</p><p>Beginner four-star iliusionary Emperor. This was Lu Ming’s current cultivation level.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming carefully felt the power in his body. Even he was a little surprised.</p><p>A vast and boundless power of the world gushed out from the small world, passed through his meridians, and spread throughout his body.</p><p>At the same time, when he became a Saint Emperor, the Saint energy was transformed into World Energy, which tempered Lu Ming’s physical body and made it stronger.</p><p>He felt that he was now filled with endless power.</p><p>Lu Ming s gaze swept across the youths like a sword.</p><p>Those who were swept by his gaze felt their hair stand on end and were filled with a strong sense of danger. They could not help but lower their heads, not daring to meet Lu Ming’s gaze.</p><p>“Who else is there? Fight me!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>None of the young men spoke.</p><p>Ou yabing, who was known as the No. 1 iliusionary Emperor among the younger generation, had been beaten half to death by Lu Ming with one move. How would the others dare to attack him?</p><p>For a moment, no one stepped out to fight!</p><p>“No one else?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Then, a young man in a blue shirt walked over from the distance. A terrifying aura bloomed from his body.</p><p>A layer of world God light spread out from his body.</p><p>True Emperor, this was a true Emperor!</p><p>“It’s the Black Tortoise forest, one of the nine absolutes!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed as he recognized the young man.</p><p>Lu Ming s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Among the younger generation in the heaven realm, there were nine strongest he aven’s favorites, known as the nine absolutes!</p><p>Each of these nine people had amazing talent and were blessed by the heavens.</p><p>Each of them had reached the true Emperor realm, far above the others.</p><p>These were the nine strongest young people in the heaven realm.</p><p>Previously, Jiu Jue had also entered the imperishable ancient city, but no one had obtained the imperishable ancient scroll.</p><p>Jiu Jue was about to make his move!</p><p>“He’s very arrogant. 1 also want to fight him!”</p><p>At this moment, another young man walked out from another direction.</p><p>This man was bald, his face was fierce, and his body was extremely burly. “Hehehe, interesting. This little sister also wants to fight him! ” hahaha! a charming laugh was heard as a beautiful young woman stepped out. “Nine absolutes, they’re all nine absolutes!”</p><p>Someone recognized that the two young men who walked out behind them were also one of the nine absolutes.</p><p>The three Supreme prodigies exuded the aura of the true Emperor realm and stood in three directions around Lu Ming. They formed a terrifying pressure that pressed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“The nine absolutes?”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly, revealing a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Heaven realm’s nine absolutes, each and every one of them was extremely talented and had rare talents. Each and every one of them was insanely strong. In addition to the heaven realm’s resources, each and every one of them had reached the true Emperor realm a long time ago.</p><p>Among the many paragons of the primordial realm, only Tianming and bubbles were the most favored. They would probably be able to stand side by side with the nine absolutes in the future.</p><p>One could see how powerful Jiu J Lie’s talent was.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had not become a great emperor. Given their status, it was not appropriate for them to attack. After ail, the difference in cultivation was too great. If they attacked, they would be laughed at.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had become a Martial Emperor, they stood up for him.</p><p>“Who’s going to do it?”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest’s nine absolutes, who was the first to step out, spoke. “Naturally, I’ll do it!”</p><p>The bald young man grinned.</p><p>“Don’t you guys know that ladies go first?”</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>The three of them wanted to attack and defeat Lu Ming to snatch the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>“Nest, a few true emperors actually want to deal with a person who just became an Emperor? Come, come, come, if you want to fight, this Lord will accompany you! ”</p><p>At the side, dandan shouted unhappily. She stepped on the air and rushed to Lu Ming’s side in a few steps.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dandan was very direct. She attacked directly. Two punches were thrown out, and two incomparably huge tortoises were shot out. The tortoiseshells of the tortoiseshells glowed with endless runes. It was as if they were two different worlds.</p><p>The two turtles pounced at the bald youth and the beautiful woman.</p><p>Dandan’s attack was not to be underestimated. The bald young man and the beautiful woman did not dare to be careless at all and could only resist with all their strength.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>A violent explosion sounded. Dandan, the bald young man, and the beautiful woman were engaged in a fierce battle, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“This is … The divine turtle of the world, could it be that the divine turtle of the world has a successor?”</p><p>Many people saw dandan’s true form and were a little shocked.</p><p>he looks very young. Could he be a new world Turtle like the space-time spirit mouse?”</p><p>Even some of the heavenly emperors were surprised.</p><p>Many heavenly emperors had broken through after the ancient times. They had never seen dandan before, so they naturally thought that she was the new divine turtle of the world. They all thought that the divine turtle of the ancient times had already fallen.</p><p>In other words, dandan was also a member of the younger generation. It was not appropriate for others to interfere in the battle between the bald youth and the beautiful woman.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll leave the weakest one for you. You can deal with him yourself!”</p><p>Dandan’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“This guy, why didn’t you finish him off as well?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and looked at the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>At this moment, the smile on the Black Tortoise forest’s face made him overjoyed and he wanted to thank him.</p><p>Dandan blocked the bald young man and the beautiful woman. Now, he was the only one left. No one was fighting with him for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me see how strong you are!”</p><p>Xuan Wuiin spoke. As soon as he finished speaking, he immediately made his move, afraid that others would snatch it from him.</p><p>He waved his hand and a brilliant star appeared in the void. Then, like a shooting star, it shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use nine types of laws. Instead, he used eight types to condense a combat sword. He swung the sword at the star.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was an explosion in the sky. The star was slashed by Lu Ming’s sword and exploded.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming s arm felt slightly numb.</p><p>As expected of one of the nine absolutes. His combat strength was extremely powerful, and his comprehension of nomological laws had reached a very profound level.</p><p>Compared to ou Yeming, his combat strength was many times stronger.</p><p>“I’ll use you to test my strength. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged toward the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The combat sword in his hand was formed by eight different laws.</p><p>It contained the Laws of Chaos and death.</p><p>At this moment, there were no longer any conflicts when Lu Ming used these two types of laws. They were perfectly fused and their power was shocking.</p><p>A few sword lights cut through the void and headed toward the Black Tortoise forest..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
