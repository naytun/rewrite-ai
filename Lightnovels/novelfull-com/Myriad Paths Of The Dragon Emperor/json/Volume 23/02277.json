It seemed that he was still at a disadvantage in terms of strength even after using eight types of laws.</p><p>Then nine laws it is!</p><p>Lu Ming added the life law into the long spear.</p><p>Updated on B0XƝ0VEL.COM</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear buzzed and its power increased greatly. It turned into a towering spear radiance and pressed toward mo tianluo.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo tianluo’s palms were like purple jade as he attacked Lu Ming. He kept blasting and colliding with Lu Ming’s spear radiance, causing a terrifying explosion.</p><p>The two of them continued to collide. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>After Lu Ming used the nine types of laws, his combat strength was at the level of a ninth stage true Emperor. He was on par with his opponent and was not weaker than him.</p><p>so strong. Lu Ming is so strong. He can totally fight with the other party!</p><p>haha, that’s right. Who says the heaven realm’s chosen are inferior to the alien race? they just didn’t come out before!</p><p>Lu Ming has created miracles and become a great emperor with many laws. He will definitely become an unparalleled expert in the future. He is the hope of the heaven realm!</p><p>Many people were discussing. When Lan Cheng heard these words, his face turned even gloomier. A cold light kept flashing in his eyes, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>The battle continued. Lu Ming and Mo tianluo fought in the sky and exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>“Defeat, lose!”</p><p>At this moment, mo tianluo was getting impatient.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too low. He was only an illusionary divine, and he could not even take down an illusionary divine. If news of this battle were to spread back to the evil god Realm, he would definitely be suppressed and ridiculed by the other princes.</p><p>His attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. The Spear’s momentum suddenly changed into a spinning momentum, strangling toward the other party. He had completely abandoned his defense.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Mo tianluo’s eyes lit up. He struck Lu Ming with his palm, but he was also swept by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>The two of them were sent flying at the same time, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood. They were seriously injured.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>He circulated the indestructible ancient scroll, and his injuries were rapidly recovering.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the other party again.</p><p>The two of them were engaged in a fierce battle. Lu Ming completely ignored defense and only attacked. He was in a stance of exchanging injury for injury.</p><p>The two of them were hit by each other, but Lu Ming’s injuries recovered quickly. On the other hand, mo tianluo’s injuries became more and more serious. His aura became weaker and his combat strength weakened rapidly. In the end, he was no match for Lu Ming and was crushed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear struck mo tianluo’s body, blasting him to the ground. The earth shattered, and Mo tianluo’s hair was disheveled. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his aura was extremely weak.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not stop and continued to attack mo tianluo.</p><p>“Senior, help me keep an eye on the other side’s Celestial Emperor!”</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to six sages.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>Mo tianluo roared and rushed out of the ground, trying to escape. However, Lu Ming caught up with him in an instant and whipped him with his spear. His body flew out like a cannonball in the direction of two world city.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor of the alien race shouted and reached out his hand, trying to grab mo tianluo.</p><p>However, with a wave of his hand, the six sacred sky clan destroyed the other party’s hand.</p><p>“What do you want to do? Are we going to start a war?”</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch bellowed and launched an attack at the same time. However, six sages was stronger and managed to block his attack.</p><p>Lu Ming had already caught up with mo tianluo.</p><p>At this moment, mo tianluo had almost no strength to fight back. Lu Ming stepped on his body, breaking his bones and bones inch by inch, worsening his injuries.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming grabbed mo tianluo’s neck and ran toward two world city.</p><p>“Release our Prince!”</p><p>The foreign celestial emperors were furious and attacked at the same time. However, celestial master Six sages and the other celestial emperors of the heaven realm also blocked their attacks. Then, they picked up the young man in blue and the others and rushed towards two world city. After catching up with Lu Ming, celestial master Six sages picked him up and flew towards two world city.</p><p>Behind him, a few foreign heavenly emperors were furious and chased after him.</p><p>However, on the two world city, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and the others made their moves. One attack after another flew out and blocked the other party.</p><p>With this, heavenly venerate six sages and the others had already returned to two world city and landed on the city walls.</p><p>He won!</p><p>Lu Ming had won!</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes in the heaven realm fell on Lu Ming, shining with surprise.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with hope again.</p><p>It was not that the heaven realm’s prodigies were inferior to him, but that the stronger ones had not made a move. Didn’t they see that Lu Ming had completely defeated his opponent the moment he made a move?</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was only an illusionary divine.</p><p>If even an empty Emperor was so powerful, how astonishing would it be in the future?</p><p>They saw hope again. In the future, the heaven realm might have a chance to fight against the alien races, or even counterattack.</p><p>“Hand over the Prince of my tribe. Otherwise, 1’11 make sure not even a chicken or dog remains!”</p><p>A few foreign celestial thearchs stopped outside the two world city and roared, hehe, I’m so scared. Come and attack! You speak as if you won’t attack if I hand it over!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He held mo tianluo’s neck and stood on the city wall.</p><p>“Brat, you’ll die a horrible death, 1 swear!”</p><p>Mo tianluo roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming held the demonic-sky silk and smashed it against the city wall.</p><p>The walls of two world city were made of special materials and carved with countless inscriptions. They were extremely hard.</p><p>Mo tianluo was smashed into a daze. Many of his bones were broken, and his face was beyond recognition. He no longer had his previous handsome appearance.</p><p>“If you continue to talk nonsense, 1’11 directly pickle you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Mo tianluo shut up.</p><p>At this moment, the few celestial thearchs of the alien race were furious. They wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces. They hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>This time, their plan was to use the younger generation to strike a blow to the morale of the heaven realm.</p><p>Originally, their plan had already been completed perfectly, and the morale of the heaven realm’s people had dropped many times.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the critical moment, Lu Ming came out and completely ruined their plan. He defeated their proud sons of heaven one after another and restored the morale of the heaven realm.</p><p>In fact, even the Prince of the alien race had fallen into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>A Prince of a foreign tribe was not only of noble status, but also extremely talented. He would definitely become an unparalleled master in the future. Nothing could happen to him.</p><p>“What do you want? Only then will you release the Prince of my tribe?”</p><p>One of the foreign celestial emperors said.</p><p>originally, I was going to kill him directly, but seeing how ‘sincere’ you are, I can let him go. How about this? give me 1000 chaos gems, and I’ll let him go!</p><p>Lu Ming demanded an exorbitant price.</p><p>“What? 1,000 chaos gems? that’s impossible. You’re too greedy!”</p><p>One of the foreign heavenly emperors roared.</p><p>iooo chaos gems? what a joke. Do you think chaos gems are cabbages? a few are already very precious, and you want iooo? ”</p><p>“If you can’t take it out, then I’ll collect his corpse!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a cold face.</p><p>one thousand Yuan is too much. It’s impossible!</p><p>A non-human heavenly Emperor said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
