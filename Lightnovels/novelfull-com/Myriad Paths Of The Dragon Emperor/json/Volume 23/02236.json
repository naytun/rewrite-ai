Lu Ming and the rest stayed at their residence and cultivated in seclusion.</p><p>As time passed, the number of people in yaoguang ancient city increased.</p><p>Almost every day, there were people trying to climb Mount eternal. There were martial artists of all levels, from martial Saints to celestial emperors, but no one was able to climb Mount eternal.</p><p>Everyone could only wait patiently.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. On this day, Mount eternal suddenly gave off multicolored light. At the same time, a Bell rang throughout yaoguang ancient city.</p><p>Everyone was alarmed and flew out of their residences.</p><p>“There’s movement in Mount eternal!”</p><p>“Don’t tell me we can enter!”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Countless people flew into the sky and headed for Mount eternal.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also woke up from their cultivation. They followed the Gu family master and the rest and flew towards Mount eternal.</p><p>For a moment, Mount eternal was surrounded by a sea of people. No one knew how many people there were.</p><p>The temptation of the indestructible ancient scroll was too strong.</p><p>With the indestructible ancient scroll, it was almost equivalent to being undying. As long as he didn’t turn into ashes, he could recover from any serious injuries. This was equivalent to having many more lives.</p><p>With the indestructible ancient scroll, one could venture into many dangerous Forbidden Lands, obtain treasures, and quickly improve their cultivation. Who wouldn’t be tempted by such an ancient scroll?</p><p>Didn’t he see that many heavenly emperors had rushed over? even the heavenly emperors couldn’t remain calm.</p><p>Countless people gathered around Mount eternal, waiting nervously.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in Mount eternal.</p><p>A burly figure slowly walked out from the depths of Mount eternal. Many people couldn’t help but widen their eyes.</p><p>“There’s someone in Mount eternal. Could it be that the immortal venerable sovereign didn’t die?”</p><p>“That’s impossible!”</p><p>Many people were shocked and skeptical.</p><p>Soon, a tall figure appeared in front of everyone. It was a middle-aged man.</p><p>“No, it’s a puppet!”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor powerhouse spoke up and saw through the situation.</p><p>The middle-aged man was a puppet.</p><p>so it’s a puppet. It must have been left behind by the undying Emperor! Many people’s hearts moved, and their eyes gathered on the puppet.</p><p>The middle-aged man-like puppet spoke, his voice loud and clear, spreading in all directions, by the will of the undying heavenly Emperor, the undying ancient scroll will be born and reappeared in the world!</p><p>His words made everyone’s heart beat faster, and their eyes lit up.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll was really about to be born.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>however, the undying heavenly Emperor has ordered that those who wish to obtain the indestructible ancient scroll must go through a test!</p><p>The middle-aged puppet continued.</p><p>“May I ask, what kind of test do 1 need to go through?”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor expert asked.</p><p>it’s very simple. First, let’s start with the celestial Emperor. Those who become a Celestial Emperor within 10000 years, please enter Mount eternal and pass the test. Then, you can obtain the indestructible ancient scroll!</p><p>you don’t have to try to deceive me. I have my own way of knowing if you have broken through to the heavenly Emperor realm within 10000 years!</p><p>The golem said.</p><p>“What? How is it possible to become a heavenly Emperor in ten thousand years?”</p><p>Immediately, those heavenly Emperor-level figures could not remain calm.</p><p>The others were also tongue-tied.</p><p>To become a heavenly Emperor within 10000 years was too difficult.</p><p>After reaching the Martial Emperor realm, it would be extremely difficult to improve.</p><p>For those who lacked talent, a single closed-door cultivation could last more than ten thousand years.</p><p>For some people, it might take more than ten thousand years to advance a small realm. It might even take tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>To become a heavenly Emperor within 10000 years, the conditions were too harsh.</p><p>“It seems that there isn’t!”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet sighed.</p><p>“Aren’t these conditions a little too harsh?”</p><p>Some heavenly emperors were unwilling to accept this.</p><p>“This is the rule set by the venerable sovereign, I have no right to change it!”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet said.</p><p>The heavenly emperors sighed and were extremely unwilling. It was a pity that no one had met the conditions.</p><p>since there’s no one else, let’s go down. Those who break through to great emperor within a thousand years can enter Mount eternal for the test!</p><p>The middle-aged puppet continued.</p><p>“A thousand years to become a great emperor?”</p><p>The faces of the great emperor realm experts also turned pale.</p><p>Becoming a great emperor in a thousand years wasn’t as difficult as becoming a heavenly Emperor in ten thousand years. However, it was still extremely difficult in essence.</p><p>The great emperors looked at each other before shaking their heads.</p><p>No one could meet the conditions.</p><p>“You don’t have any? Then let’s continue. Those who become true emperors in a hundred years can enter Mount eternal for the test!”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet continued.</p><p>a hundred years to become a true Emperor? hahaha, wasn’t this tailor-made for me? I’m here!</p><p>Dandan grinned and laughed, extremely excited.</p><p>In a sense, dandan had already been reborn. This life was a new one. He had indeed stepped into the true Emperor realm within a hundred years.</p><p>Other than dandan, there were also some other people who flew into the sky.</p><p>There were more than ten people.</p><p>There were quite a few of them who became true emperors in a hundred years.</p><p>the nine absolutes of the younger generation all broke through to the true Emperor realm within a hundred years. There are also some other heaven’s favorites who are almost a hundred years old!</p><p>look, there are at least seven of the nine unique youths!</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his gaze. Indeed, among the dozen people, there were some who looked particularly young. They seemed to be in their twenties. There were both men and women.</p><p>There were also a few others who looked to be in their thirties.</p><p>These people had all become true emperors within a hundred years.</p><p>Lu Ming had previously learned that the nine unique youths were the nine most outstanding talents among the younger generation in the heaven realm. Each of these nine people had entered the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Countless people looked at him with envy.</p><p>Being able to take the test at Mount eternal meant that there was a chance of obtaining the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>More than a dozen people flew towards Mount eternal. When they got close to Mount eternal, the middle-aged puppet waved his hand and a door of light appeared in the sky.</p><p>“You guys can go in!”</p><p>The middle-aged puppet said.</p><p>Immediately, the dozen of them rushed into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>the assessment will take some time. Let’s wait!</p><p>The middle-aged puppet sat down cross-legged and closed its eyes to rest.</p><p>The others quietly waited for them to wake up, but more than ten days had passed, and the people who had entered still had not come out.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a monarch weapon and sat cross-legged on it. He closed his eyes to comprehend the laws.</p><p>Now, he was only left with the life law. He had yet to reach the first stage of perfection. As long as his life law reached the first stage of perfection, he could start to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. Therefore, he had to seize the time.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.</p><p>At this moment, there was finally some movement from Mount eternal.</p><p>Mount eternal glowed. With a slight shake, a dozen figures appeared outside mount eternal.</p><p>They were the dozen people who had entered Mount eternal.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on them, full of anticipation.</p><p>Had any of these people obtained the indestructible ancient scroll?</p><p>However, all of them were dejected and unwilling to give up.</p><p>“How is it? What’s the situation inside?”</p><p>Many people began to ask.</p><p>Dandan also flew back..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
