Heavenly cycle stellar fist</p><p>Translator: 549690339</p><p>“Heavenly cycle stellar fist!”</p><p>Black Tortoise Lin let out a long hiss and burst out with all his strength. The power of the world churned and intertwined with the power of the laws. Stars appeared one after another around his body.</p><p>A total of three hundred and sixty stars had formed and appeared in all directions of the Black Tortoise forest. He stood in the middle of the stars like a god.</p><p>it’s the heavenly cycle stellar fist, the ultimate technique of the heavenly Emperor of stars!</p><p>Someone said excitedly. This kind of divine ability was extremely famous in the heaven realm.</p><p>“Between Lu Ming and the Black Tortoise forest, who do you think will win?”</p><p>1 think it’s the Black Tortoise forest. Although the Black Tortoise forest is ranked at the bottom of the nine absolutes, it has long reached the true Emperor realm. Its battle prowess is extremely shocking. I think it has already reached the battle prowess of a stage three true Emperor!</p><p>I think so too. Although Lu Ming is strong, he has just become a great emperor. He is not familiar with the use of the world Energy. He should not be a match for the Black Tortoise forest!</p><p>While some people were discussing spiritedly, Lu Ming and the Black Tortoise forest had already begun an intense confrontation.</p><p>With a wave of the Black Tortoise forest’s hand, one star after another crashed toward Lu Ming like meteors, destroying a few of Lu Ming’s sword gleams.</p><p>Lu Ming became one with his sword and charged toward the Black Tortoise forest, slashing his combat sword continuously.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to swing his sword. In an instant, he had slashed more than ten times at the stars.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky continued to explode. Lu Ming was like a god, standing in the void of the universe and turning into a Supreme giant. He split a star with his sword. The scene was very visually impactful.</p><p>There were more than ten consecutive explosions and more than ten of them were destroyed by Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming’s body was also blocked.</p><p>“You’re just so-so, kill!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest shouted and his body was filled with Starlight. With a wave of his hand, dozens of stars charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the stars that were shattered by Lu Ming condensed around his body again. There were 360 stars around his body.</p><p>Lu Ming exerted all his strength. The power of the world gushed into the combat sword in his hand. The combat sword hummed and eight types of laws intertwined together. Different laws and different mysteries intertwined and burst out with a shocking power.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to slash out. Each slash could explode a star vortex.</p><p>However, there were too many stars, and each one of them was extremely powerful. It was like a real star, full of terrifying destructive power.</p><p>No, I didn’t.</p><p>Every time he split a star, Lu Ming would be bombarded by a terrifying force.</p><p>“Let’s see how many of my bullets you can block!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest said coldly. He quickly formed a seal with his hands and pushed forward. This time, more than a hundred stars flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Finally, after Lu Ming continuously blocked the attacks, he was forced to retreat by the stars.</p><p>the nine-Jue is indeed powerful. It seems that 1 still need to use nine types of nomological laws!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. All of a sudden, the combat sword in his hand dissipated. The next moment, a long spear condensed. This long spear contained nine types of laws.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that although it was extremely difficult to integrate ultimate maxims and develop a divine power Technique, the power that burst forth when it was successful was extremely terrifying.</p><p>With every addition, the power would increase explosively.</p><p>After adding in the life law, its power was much stronger than before.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear trembled and stabbed forward. Rays of spear light broke through the void and pierced toward the stars.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The stars kept exploding.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a hundred stars were blasted apart by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and charged toward the Black Tortoise forest like a god of War.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest’s expression changed. He waved his hand again, and stars flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear continued to thrust out and the stars continued to explode. They could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Heavenly cycle stellar fist, stars congregate!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest roared. He gathered everyone’s stars into a huge star and pressed it down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming only made a faint sound. He became one with the spear and turned into a dazzling spear ray that pierced through the void.</p><p>In the sky, it was as if two meteors had collided, one big and one small.</p><p>However, in the end, the small one was even more powerful. It directly pierced through the large star and went straight for the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest bellowed in rage, his expression extremely ugly.</p><p>His strongest move had been countered by Lu Ming.</p><p>Was he going to lose?</p><p>“No, I can’t be defeated!”</p><p>Black Tortoise Lin roared in his heart, and his face contorted.</p><p>Once he was defeated, Lu Ming would naturally take his place and become the new nine absolutes.</p><p>He, on the other hand, would be knocked off his divine altar. This was something he could not accept.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re the one who forced me to do this. Go to hell!”</p><p>Black Tortoise Lin roared in his heart, and killing intent burst forth from his eyes. The space between his brows glowed, and a weapon flew out.</p><p>It was a pair of extremely huge scissors, and its entire body was emitting dazzling Starlight.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The scissors enlarged rapidly and cut toward Lu Ming.</p><p>this is a great emperor weapon! Despicable!</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>In a fair battle between peers, the Black Tortoise forest had used a great emperor weapon. This was too much.</p><p>This had already exceeded the scope of a fair battle.</p><p>However, the scissors were too fast. In an instant, they were above Lu Ming’s head and were about to cut him in half.</p><p>“Don’t think that you’re the only one with a weapon.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. The long spear in his hand disappeared and was replaced by a large bow.</p><p>The fallen star bow!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly pulled the bowstring.</p><p>He still did not pull the bowstring. He could only pull the bowstring slightly. However, the angle was much greater than before Lu Ming became a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s law gushed into the fallen star bow. World Energy gushed in crazily and an arrow that emitted nine colors was condensed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming released his grip and the arrow flew out, shooting towards the huge scissors.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The arrow hit the pair of scissors, and the scissors trembled violently before being sent flying.</p><p>Although the scissors were a great emperor weapon, it was impossible for the Black Tortoise forest’s cultivation base to unleash its full power. It was sent flying by Lu Ming’s arrow and trembled continuously.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest also suffered a backlash. His body shook violently, and he retreated continuously. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He pulled the bowstring again and a nine-colored arrow was shot at the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>Just now, the Black Tortoise forest obviously wanted to kill him. Since that was the case, he would not show any mercy.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest’s face turned pale with fright as he roared in fear.</p><p>He could feel the threat of death from Lu Ming’s arrow. He knew that if he was hit by this arrow, he would die without a doubt.</p><p>He frantically changed his position, but the arrow seemed to have locked onto his aura and would constantly change its position.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>arghh! a furious roar sounded out as a figure suddenly appeared in front of the arrow. He reached out and grabbed the nine-colored arrow. With a squeeze, the arrow shattered into light spots and dissipated in the air..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
