The members of the evil god tribe were being killed one after another.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s people roared in anger, but it was useless. A few high-stage true emperors were also killed by the heaven realm’s experts.</p><p>More than 100 members of the evil god race were all killed.</p><p>Then, the experts from the heaven realm began to bombard the gate of the castle.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The castle’s Gate kept exploding, and the light covering it flickered. It was much dimmer than before, and it looked like it was going to be destroyed soon.</p><p>“Let’s go there in disguise!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Just what 1 wanted!”</p><p>Dan dan nodded, her eyes flashing coldly. They did not want to let others take advantage of them, especially when LAN Yun and Yan Xi were among them.</p><p>The two of them changed their appearance drastically. They changed their clothes and became completely different people.</p><p>Then, the two of them flew towards the castle.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Someone noticed them and looked at them.</p><p>“It’s our own people, our own people!”</p><p>Dandan quickly called out.</p><p>Seeing that they weren’t from the evil god race, everyone was relieved.</p><p>If it wasn’t the evil god tribe, it was naturally the people from the heaven realm.</p><p>LAN Yun’s gaze also swept toward Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>I thought it was Lu Ming and the other two. It turns out that it’s not them.</p><p>What a pity. Otherwise, I would have crippled them this time!</p><p>LAN Yun muttered.</p><p>This time, the LAN family had sent another expert. With an advanced true Emperor, he was full of confidence. As long as he met Lu Ming and dandan, he would definitely make them regret it.</p><p>The moment he thought of being beaten up so miserably by dandan, LAN Yun’s hatred went crazy!</p><p>LAN Yun did not avoid it and Lu Ming and dandan heard him clearly.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Dandan gritted her teeth and rolled her eyes. Lu Ming knew that dandan must be up to no good and was thinking of how to deal with LAN Yun.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the gate of the castle kept shaking and making a loud noise.</p><p>“It’s going to be blasted apart!”</p><p>“Let’s put in more effort!”</p><p>Many people shouted and attacked with even more effort.</p><p>“Heaven realm trash, die!”</p><p>At this moment, a furious roar came from the distance. Rays of purple light streaked across the sky and rushed over.</p><p>They were people from the evil god tribe. Furthermore, their numbers were extremely shocking. There were more than a hundred of them.</p><p>They were all experts, and their bodies were covered in purple scales.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had learned from dandan.</p><p>The evil god tribe was also divided into different levels.</p><p>The black-scaled evil god tribe was the most ordinary evil god tribe. Their status was also the lowest, and their combat strength was also relatively weak.</p><p>As for the purple-scaled evil god race, they were the aristocrats of the evil god race, and their strength was far above that of the black-scaled evil god race when they were at the same level.</p><p>Above the purple-scaled evil god race, there was the even more noble evil god race, such as the Royal race of the evil god race. Their battle prowess was even stronger, and they were almost invincible in a battle of the same level. However, they were extremely rare.</p><p>The expressions of the people from the heaven realm changed.</p><p>“Quick, blast open the door!”</p><p>Someone roared. Almost everyone attacked, and beams of brilliant light bombarded the castle Gate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an explosion, the light of the castle Gate was destroyed, and the gate opened.</p><p>“Charge in!”</p><p>The people of the heaven realm rushed into the gate one after another.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Behind them, the evil god tribe had also arrived. They followed closely behind the heaven realm’s body cultivators and rushed through the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan followed the crowd and rushed into the door.</p><p>As soon as they entered the gate, they were not inside the castle as they had imagined, but a vast Hill with no end in sight.</p><p>It was like a small world. Behind the castle, there was a small world.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Behind them, the evil god tribe had arrived, and the two groups of people were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan mixed in with the crowd and made a symbolic move to fight with the two evil god race members.</p><p>Lu Ming did not even make a move. He hid behind dandan because if he made a move, many of the laws would be exposed.</p><p>Hundreds of people from both sides were killing each other. It was extremely tragic. Experts were killed from time to time and fell in this area forever.</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were experts beside LAN Yun and Yan Xi. They were very powerful and were advanced true emperors.</p><p>Obviously, the LAN family and the Yan family were both terrifying forces in the heaven realm. They had even sent a high-level void Emperor.</p><p>One must know that it was very dangerous for a high-level void Emperor to enter this place. If they were unlucky, they would die. If they were sent in, they had to be prepared to die. If they were not strong or had a deep foundation, they would not dare to do so.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as the two sides were fighting, blood-red figures rushed over at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He saw that the blood-red figures were in both human and beast forms. After they rushed over, they immediately pounced on the heaven realm and the evil god tribe.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A huge blood-colored wave also pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Dandan appeared and kicked the blood-red giant wolf away.</p><p>“It’s a puppet!”</p><p>Said dandan. At the same time, Lu Ming could tell that it was a puppet.</p><p>It was a strange puppet that was filled with killing intent. Its entire body was blood-red, and it even reeked of blood.</p><p>Moreover, they were not afraid of death and continued to pounce on the people from both sides.</p><p>The heaven realm and evil god tribe’s experts could only stop fighting and focus on dealing with these blood puppets.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>One after another, the Crimson puppets were destroyed.</p><p>Not long after, most of the blood-colored puppets that had charged over were finally killed. However, there were also dozens of corpses left behind from the heaven realm and the evil god tribe.</p><p>The two sides gathered in a corner, sizing each other up with cold killing intent.</p><p>However, he didn’t make a move.</p><p>It was very likely that this was a small world left behind by an unparalleled expert. It was possible that there would be a great opportunity. Both sides had the same thought.</p><p>He would first search for treasures and obtain opportunities, then kill the other party.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The first to move was the evil god tribe. They rushed forward in the left direction and disappeared into the hills.</p><p>Then, the people from the heaven realm also moved. They rushed forward along the right side.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan followed in the middle of the crowd.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Roars could be heard from time to time. There were some blood puppets moving between these Hills. As soon as they saw living creatures, they would pounce at them, but they were defeated one by one.</p><p>After moving forward for a distance, he still didn’t find anything.</p><p>let’s split up. This way, the chances of us getting an opportunity will be higher!</p><p>LAN Yun was the first to speak.</p><p>The others nodded in agreement. Then, the heaven realm’s people split into groups and moved forward in different directions.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi led the experts of the LAN and Yan families and headed in one direction.</p><p>Both of their families had sent their experts. There were high and low level true emperors. They were very confident and didn’t want to go with the others.</p><p>“Let’s follow them!”</p><p>Dandan said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan quietly followed LAN Yun. They did not notice at all that they were behind Yan Xi and the rest..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
