The strength of his physical body was rapidly weakening.</p><p>The nine drops of blood essence of the nine Dragons glowed and flew into the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons burst out with Dragon roars.</p><p>At the same time, the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons began to merge.</p><p>This sudden change caused the face of the evil god race’s old ancestor to change, and he unleashed an even stronger attack.</p><p>However, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron completed its fusion as it shook. The nine Cauldrons fused into one.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan were still in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The nine Cauldrons combined into one, and their power increased greatly.</p><p>They were even larger than mountains, filling the sky and suppressing the other party.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>His opponent’s combat sword kept striking the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. However, the power of the nine Cauldrons was indeed stronger. With a shake, his opponent’s combat sword exploded inch by inch.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron didn’t stop and continued to attack the other party.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other party’s palm struck the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. The divine cauldron was unscathed, but the other party’s body trembled violently and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent soared. He took the opportunity to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and bombarded it at his opponent.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron’s attack was brutal and direct. There was no technique involved, and it simply crushed the opponent.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill this f * eking dog!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The evil god race’s old master was sent flying once more, and he was forced to retreat. His purple hair fluttered in the wind, and his eyes were filled with rage. “Ant!”</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor bellowed.</p><p>He could sense Lu Ming and dandan’s cultivation in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. In his eyes, such cultivation was no different from that of ants.</p><p>But now, he was being suppressed by two ants. This made him furious.</p><p>As he roared, the body of the evil god tribe’s old master rapidly grew in size. In the end, he surpassed the mountain peak and reached into the clouds. He was even bigger than the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>At the same time, the light on his body grew even brighter, and his aura continued to rise.</p><p>not good, this guy is going to go all out. He’s going to raise his combat strength to the peak regardless of his injuries!</p><p>Dandan exclaimed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the aura of the evil god tribe’s old ancestor reached its peak.</p><p>A beam of light burst out of the third eye and turned into a huge sword, which slashed toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron also emitted a layer of light and rumbled toward the other party.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A terrifying vibration was heard as the area exploded. The ground cracked and the space was smashed.</p><p>They appeared in the dark void and continued to fight.</p><p>The evil god race’s old master slammed out with his palm. The huge palm covered the entire sky as it struck the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron shook violently again.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s old ancestor then unleashed a storm of attacks.</p><p>At this moment, the evil god race’s old ancestor was raising his combat strength to the peak without caring about his injuries. This was truly shocking. This was a true peerless expert, a figure that was revered in the universe. He was simply too strong.</p><p>At this moment, even if the nine Divine Dragon cauldrons were combined, it would be difficult to defeat the other party.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was suppressed, but the Dragon roars were endless and getting louder and louder.</p><p>Finally, a real Dragon emerged from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. No, it was Nine Dragons!</p><p>There were Nine Dragons with nine claws under their bellies.</p><p>The nine Dragons appeared. At first, they were still very illusory, but they became more and more solid. In the end, they were so lifelike that they seemed real, as if the nine Dragons had come back to life.</p><p>WOWO, the nine Dragons have appeared. No, this is the combination of his blood essence and the mark of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. It’s not a real entity!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons let out long roars, and their eyes shone as bright as the sun. Their dragon claws stepped through the air as they pounced toward the evil god race’s old master.</p><p>“Nine Dragons!”</p><p>The evil god race’s old master roared as a look of fear flashed across his eyes. Even though he was the old ancestor of the evil god tribe, he wasn’t someone who had survived from the ancient era. He had been born later and had never seen the nine Dragons before.</p><p>However, he had heard of the rumors about Nine Dragons.</p><p>Each of the heaven realm’s top 10 Battle Beasts was a peak expert and extremely terrifying. Back then, countless experts of the evil god tribe had died at their hands.</p><p>His ancestors had all died at the hands of the top ten beasts.</p><p>When he saw the nine Dragons, he subconsciously felt a little scared. However, he immediately reacted. These were not real Dragons, so what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>He let out a loud roar and charged towards the nine Dragons, engaging in a battle with them.</p><p>After all, the nine Dragons were only nine drops of blood essence, and they were manifested by the mark in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Their strength was far inferior to that of their peak.</p><p>As for the evil god race’s old master, he had already raised his strength to his peak.</p><p>The battle between the two sides was difficult to determine a winner in a short time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s more important to completely destroy that passageway. Don’t get entangled with the other party!”</p><p>At this moment, evil swordsman’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded secretly and sent a voice transmission to evil swordsman,” “Senior, how can we completely destroy that passage?”</p><p>control the nine Dragons and have them bombard the passageway. Turn the space there into nothingness and return it to chaos. In that case, it will take at least a hundred years for the passageway to reappear. This will buy us some time!</p><p>Evil sword guest said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming made his decision and began to control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragons exchanged another blow with the other party, then turned around and rushed back to the original passage.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was right under the nine Dragons. It followed the nine Dragons and moved rapidly toward the original passage. “If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The evil god race’s old master roared and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron at a very fast speed. In the blink of an eye, they arrived at the original passageway.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and stomped with their nine claws. A terrifying attack blasted towards that position.</p><p>The space in that area was constantly exploding, turning into the tiniest particles.</p><p>Back then, although the passageway had collapsed and exploded, it had not been completely destroyed.</p><p>From time to time, a spatial Rift would appear. This way, it was still possible to open it with some powerful means.</p><p>However, if it was completely destroyed, it would be difficult to open it in a short time.</p><p>Naturally, the evil god race’s old ancestor knew what Lu Ming was up to. He was instantly enraged and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, right at this moment, a Dragon’s Roar rang out from the depths of the sky. An incomparably huge true dragon appeared, and its dragon claws grabbed out toward the evil god race’s old ancestor.</p><p>“It’s this true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Back then, when he had passed through the passageway and arrived in the heaven realm, he had seen the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron bring along the nine dragon veins and fight against the evil god tribe’s patriarch.</p><p>At that time, there was also an incomparably huge true dragon that had participated in the battle, and its strength was terrifying..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
