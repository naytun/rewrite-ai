The arm that was holding onto the battle axe let out a cracking sound as even his bone armor was broken.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The second cauldron pressed down, and the evil god tribe’s great emperor let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>He had fallen!</p><p>Although a great emperor should only be a low-level great emperor, he was killed by the continuous attacks of the two Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had awakened, and its power was terrifying.</p><p>“Damn it, go and kill them!”</p><p>In the distance, some of the evil god race members noticed this and roared out in rage.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>There were at least five to six members of the evil god tribe charging toward Lu Ming and the others. There were even high-level great emperors among them.</p><p>“Come on, full recovery!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed as a nine-Dragon coiled around him. The nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons were all shaking, and Dragon roars were constantly heard.</p><p>The nine dragon veins that were wrapped around the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron seemed to have come to life. They shone with light and looked alive.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons all flew up and hovered around Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>One of them was floating above the two of them, emitting a beam of light that enveloped the two of them. The other eight were floating around the two of them.</p><p>At this moment, the evil god tribe had also arrived!</p><p>The six experts of the evil god tribe were all at the great emperor realm, and there were even high-level great emperors among them.</p><p>With so many great emperors working together, it was absolutely terrifying!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and pushed with both hands. The eight Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons flew out and continued to grow in size. They filled the sky and pressed down on the six powerhouses from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Within the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, Dragon roars could be heard. The eight divine cauldrons were even larger than the archaic divine mountain and were filled with endless power.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Under the pressure of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, the low-level great emperor screamed and died on the spot.</p><p>The advanced great Emperor’s body cracked and blood spurted out of his mouth. He was filled with fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>the eight cauldrons trembled and released a terrifying power. The evil god race high-level Emperor’s body exploded inch by inch and died.</p><p>what a powerful force! The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron contains the power of that kid, Nine Dragons. He has already fully recovered. Kill him!</p><p>Dandan laughed out loud, extremely excited.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He opened his mouth and rushed towards the battlefield.</p><p>He controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>At this moment, evil swordsman and the evil god tribe’s old ancestor were still engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>Evil swordsman activated his Origin Energy, and his battle prowess skyrocketed. However, he could only fight to a draw with the evil god race’s old ancestor, and it was difficult for him to defeat him.</p><p>Although the three great emperors from two world city were peak great emperors, there were too many experts on the other side. At this moment, they were in a precarious situation and were covered in blood. They could die at the hands of the other party at any moment.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming arrived!</p><p>Out of the nine Cauldrons, one of them protected him while the other eight charged toward the evil god tribe.</p><p>The eight cauldrons covered the sky. On each cauldron, a dragon vein emerged, emitting light and roaring at the sky.</p><p>The eight cauldrons resonated with each other, and their power increased by several times.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As the cauldron pressed down, the evil god tribe members exploded one by one and died on the spot.</p><p>Those below the great emperor realm couldn’t put up any resistance. Even some low-level great emperors below the three-star realm couldn’t put up much of a fight and were killed.</p><p>The four star great emperors couldn’t block it either. They spat out blood and felt like their bodies were going to explode.</p><p>A single attack had killed a large number of evil god tribe members.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up and she shouted.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The evil god race roared, and some peak emperors charged toward Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and attacked it in turns.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron continued to clash with the peak emperors.</p><p>Dozens of moves were exchanged in an instant, and the peak emperors were forced back and spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>His body began to crack.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron seemed to have come back to life. It was so powerful that even peak great emperors couldn’t fight against it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three peak great emperors from two world city seized the opportunity to kill one of the peak great emperors. At the same time, Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to attack.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s help, they had the upper hand. The evil god tribe’s powerhouses were constantly being hunted down.</p><p>In just a few minutes, more than 200 people from the evil god tribe had been killed, and there were even dozens of great emperor realm experts.</p><p>This was an astonishing battle achievement. If this was in the primordial realm, it would probably scare people to death.</p><p>Although this was the battlefield between the Tai Qing heavenly region and the alien tribes, where most of the experts of the two worlds were gathered, it was rare for dozens of great emperors to fall at once.</p><p>The evil god tribe’s Thearch was a little afraid. When he saw Lu Ming, he retreated one after another.</p><p>“Go help senior evil swordsman!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and flew toward the battlefield where evil swordsman and the evil god race’s patriarch were.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pushed with both hands. The eight Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons flew out and pressed down on the evil god race’s old master.</p><p>“You two ants, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The evil god tribe’s old ancestor bellowed in rage. Lu Ming had just killed so many of the evil god tribe’s powerhouses, and his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>Beams of light shot out of his third eye. They were the Light of Destruction.</p><p>However, the evil god tribe’s patriarch’s destructive light was not just a beam of light. It could actually transform into three-eyed magical beasts that were as large as mountains. They pounced toward Lu Ming and collided with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying tremor resounded through the firmament. The void was constantly disintegrating as if it was about to return to chaos.</p><p>The eight cauldrons were sent flying back. Lu Ming felt a terrifying force pressing down on him, almost causing his body to explode.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated hastily. His face was pale and the qi and blood in his body were boiling.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Only then did Lu Ming understand that the evil god tribe’s patriarch was too powerful. He could not be mentioned in the same breath as a great emperor. There was a huge gap between them.</p><p>Even though the evil god race’s patriarch was already heavily injured and was still in a battle with evil swordsman, the destructive light emitted by his third eye was still able to force the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron back and almost injure Lu Ming.</p><p>“Dandan, let’s enter the divine cauldron!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to dandan.</p><p>Dandan nodded, and then the two of them flew into the divine cauldron above their heads.</p><p>Inside the divine cauldron, the protective power was even stronger. External forces would be blocked by the divine cauldron.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming controlled the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and made it fly out to join the other eight divine cauldrons.</p><p>The power of the nine Cauldrons combined was even more terrifying.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron spun and charged toward the evil god race’s old ancestor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time around, he finally managed to shatter the demonic beasts that were formed from the other party’s destructive light and blasted them toward the evil god race’s old ancestor’s body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword howled. How could evil swordsman miss such an opportunity? he used all his strength and slashed out with a shocking sword strike..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
