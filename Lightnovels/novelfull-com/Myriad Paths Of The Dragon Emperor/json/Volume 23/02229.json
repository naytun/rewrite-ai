If he could really obtain the indestructible ancient scroll, then he would be extremely lucky.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming, Mu Lan, and dandan followed Gu Xinghui and left the place, arriving at the hall of the Gu family.</p><p>This time, the Gu family will also send people over to try their luck.</p><p>Mount eternal had wandered in the eternal space of darkness for so many years. It had suddenly appeared. It was very difficult to obtain it by relying on cultivation alone. One needed luck.</p><p>Therefore, the Gu family sent out some heaven’s favorites. Gu yingzhong, the number one heaven’s favorite of the Gu family, was naturally among them.</p><p>However, there were also quite a number of experts, including those of the true Emperor realm and great emperor realm. They were all led by the Gu family’s master.</p><p>The group soared into the sky and headed to the nearest teleportation zone.</p><p>Yaoguang ancient city was located in the Western part of the Tai Qing heavenly region. After a few days, the Gu family arrived at the ancient city.</p><p>Yaoguang ancient city was one of the oldest ancient cities in the heaven realm.</p><p>In the heaven realm, there weren’t many that could be called ancient cities. Every one of them had been built over countless years and was full of the marks of time.</p><p>During this period of time, this ancient city that had been around for countless years had become extremely lively.</p><p>There was a sea of people, all of them experts.</p><p>Experts from all over the Tai Qing heavenly region had arrived.</p><p>Not only the human race, but also the other divine beast races.</p><p>For example, true dragons, heavenly Tigers, phoenixes, and others could be seen from time to time.</p><p>In the sky above the north gate of yaoguang ancient city, there was a huge divine mountain floating there. It was huge and majestic, like the legendary ancient divine mountain.</p><p>This was Mount eternal!</p><p>Lu Ming and the group did not enter yaoguang ancient city at first. Instead, they headed towards Mount eternal.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Even from a distance, they could see the dazzling lights flashing non-stop and hear the shocking rumbles.</p><p>Someone wanted to ascend Mount eternal, and it was a very shocking expert.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a figure shrouded in divine light charging towards Mount eternal at an alarming speed. However, no matter how fast he charged towards Mount eternal, it seemed that he could not cross the seemingly long distance and could not get close to it.</p><p>On Mount eternal, there was a layer of light. It seemed to have stopped there, but it could not get close.</p><p>is that a heavenly Emperor?!</p><p>Someone from the Gu family asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“That’s right, he is indeed a heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>The Gu family’s master said.</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. Even a heavenly Emperor couldn’t climb Mount eternal?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a bird cry resounded through the sky.</p><p>Everyone saw a Phoenix spreading its wings and flying towards Mount eternal.</p><p>The aura that this Phoenix exuded was heaven-shaking and earth-shattering. Its body was even larger, and its wings were wide open, covering the sky and covering the sun.</p><p>This was definitely a terrifying Phoenix. Its cultivation was no weaker than the human expert from before. Without a doubt, it was an existence in the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>With a flap of its wings, the void collapsed, forming a terrifying dark space. It flew toward Mount eternal at a speed unimaginable to ordinary people.</p><p>However, this terrifying Phoenix still found it difficult to ascend Mount eternal.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A roar spread in all directions.</p><p>A huge white Tiger, filled with endless killing intent, rushed towards Mount eternal. But just like the Phoenix, it still found it difficult to climb the mountain.</p><p>The White Tiger roared in anger and extended a giant claw. It was incomparably terrifying and was even larger than a mountain. It grabbed towards Mount eternal from the sky.</p><p>Clearly, The White Tiger couldn’t climb the mountain and was extremely furious, wanting to blow up Mount eternal.</p><p>Its giant claw was even bigger than Mount eternal. Unfortunately, when it grabbed down, Mount eternal was like an illusion. It grabbed nothing and nothing.</p><p>Following that, everyone saw a few more powerful existences trying to climb Mount eternal, but to no avail.</p><p>There were many people watching nearby. Lu Ming and the rest learned from the people who were watching that during this period of time, no less than ten heavenly Emperor stage existences had come here. They had used various methods to try to ascend Mount eternal and obtain the indestructible ancient scroll, but all of them had failed.</p><p>There were also people of the heavenly Emperor realm, true Emperor realm, and empty Emperor realm, but they all failed.</p><p>Some people speculated that the indestructible ancient scroll hadn’t appeared yet, and it was obviously impossible to obtain it by relying on strength.</p><p>One must know that the undying venerable Emperor was an invincible figure.</p><p>Many people stayed in yaoguang ancient city and waited for the opportunity.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group looked around Mount eternal but found nothing. Even dandan shook her head. They could only go to yaoguang ancient city and find a place to stay.</p><p>“Yaoguang ancient city. 1 heard that it is one of the oldest cities in the heaven realm. Many experts have been born in history and many historical sites have been left behind. How about we go and take a look?”</p><p>The solitary shadow invited Lu Ming, dandan, and Mu Lan again.</p><p>The Gu family had been living in seclusion for generations and rarely came out. The chances of Gu Ying coming out were not many either. If it wasn’t for the indestructible ancient scroll, the Gu family wouldn’t have brought them out.</p><p>It was rare for him to come out, so he was naturally very curious.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. Together with Gu yingchong, they left their residence and strolled around yaoguang ancient city.</p><p>The Alkaid ancient city was not only ancient, but it also occupied a large area. There were countless streets and countless ancient ruins.</p><p>For example, there were Dao Comprehension stone tablets. These Dao Comprehension stone tablets had the marks of the great Dao left by experts, which were of great help to those below the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>Many people below the martial Supreme realm sat cross-legged under the Dao Comprehension monument, quietly comprehending and cultivating.</p><p>There was another place with many statues. They were all famous statues from past generations. Each of them exuded a domineering will that made people admire them.</p><p>Many people, including Lu Ming and a few others, were watching.</p><p>guys, look! That’s the statue of the top ten Battle Beasts!</p><p>Gu yingzhong said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw many statues of different species.</p><p>It was a nine-Dragon with a winding body and nine dragon claws under its belly. The scales on its body were clearly visible and vivid, as if the nine Dragons had come back to life.</p><p>One of them was a giant elephant the size of a small mountain. Its muscles were clearly defined and it seemed to possess explosive power. This was the Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>Next, he saw the Titan longhorn beetle, the undying celestial hou, the nine lives devilish silkworm… These were the statues of the top ten beasts.</p><p>He saw a total of nine, but he didn’t see the statue of the World Turtle.</p><p>dandan, 1 don’t think you’re in the list. It seems that your reputation is not good enough, or others think that you don’t deserve to be on par with the other nine!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at dandan and teased her.</p><p>Bullsh * t, the people who carved these statues must be ignorant or have a grudge against me. Damn it, they actually didn’t put my statue in!</p><p>Dandan was extremely unhappy and gritted her teeth. Finally, her eyes lit up and she said,” I know, they must be unable to carve out my majestic spirit, so they don’t have a statue of me. It must be like this, haha!</p><p>Tsk!</p><p>Lu Ming and the group looked at him with disdain.</p><p>After a while, they left the place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is that you? You … How did you come to the heaven realm?”</p><p>Right at this moment, a voice rang out. It seemed to be extremely surprised.</p><p>“Luo cangqiong? And … The stellar River!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and there was a cold glint in his eyes..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
