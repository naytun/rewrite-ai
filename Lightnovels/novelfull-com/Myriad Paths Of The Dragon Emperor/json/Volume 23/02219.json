The stronger his physical body was, the stronger his battle prowess would be, and the more vigorous his life force would be.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s soul force sank into his sea of consciousness and observed the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had been floating in his spiritual ocean ever since it had entered.</p><p>The nine Cauldrons were dull and lightless. Even the patterns on them were deathly still, as if they had lost their spirituality.</p><p>Lu Ming materialized in his sea of consciousness and observed carefully. He tried to activate the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron one last time, but there was no reaction at all.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron seemed to have lost its spirituality.</p><p>it seems that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron has been greatly damaged in this battle. It has no energy left, can’t be restored, and can’t be controlled!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated. At the same time, he felt that it was a pity.</p><p>If he could control the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron, he would become a top powerhouse in the heaven realm. Unfortunately, no matter how hard Lu Ming tried, he could not revive the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. There was no movement at all.</p><p>Thinking about it, it made sense. During this period of time, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron had gone through two battles in a row.</p><p>When Lu Ming first came, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron brought along the nine dragon veins and fought against the four unparalleled powerhouses of the evil god tribe at their peak. In the end, the four patriarchs of the evil god tribe were severely injured. The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron definitely played a huge role.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron itself was smashed into the ground and almost lost its spirituality. It was Lu Ming who activated it with the blood essence of the nine Dragons that allowed it to be revived.</p><p>However, after a battle, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron even manifested Nine Dragons at the end. However, the nine Dragons self-destructed in the end. The damage to the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was extremely serious. It was not difficult to understand why it had fallen to this state!</p><p>“Can you take it out?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. After many attempts, he could finally summon the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron from his sea of consciousness. However, he could not unleash its power. It was like a useless cauldron.</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He planned to study the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron when he had the chance in the future.</p><p>right, there was a drop of blood that flew into my body earlier. What kind of creature’s blood was that? where is it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the mysterious drop of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried that a drop of mysterious blood had flown into his body. He carefully searched his body.</p><p>However, there was no trace of that drop of blood on his body.</p><p>“No, something’s wrong with my heart!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming found an abnormality in the position of his heart.</p><p>His soul power sank into his heart, and as expected, he found a drop of blood.</p><p>This drop of blood was crystal clear, and there was a small true dragon swimming in it.</p><p>“Could this be the blood of a true dragon? could it be that true dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the true dragon that had fought against the evil god tribe in the ancient battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming tried to guess if the true dragon was injured and a drop of blood flew into his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul force approached the drop of blood and tried to control it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon’s Roar burst out from the blood.</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar was filled with endless majesty and an ancient feeling. It was as if it was an existence from countless years ago that had pierced through time and carried a thick aura of time.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar was endless. That drop of blood actually moved and turned into a true dragon. It roared towards the sky, and its pair of dragon eyes were like two suns.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked because he realized that the true dragon formed by this drop of blood was exactly the same as the true dragon that had fought against the evil god tribe.</p><p>At this moment, the true dragon’s gaze was not directed at Lu Ming’s soul force, but in another direction. It was the direction of Lu Ming’s spine, which was also the direction of the third Blood Meridian.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, the third bloodline seemed to have resonated with something. A deafening roar came from the third bloodline.</p><p>This voice was filled with endless killing intent and it almost shattered Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Roars filled with killing intent came one after another. The drop of blood from the third bloodline seemed to have turned into a vast sea of blood. The blood waves rolled and the killing intent was endless.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that things had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>He could not control the third bloodline at all, nor could he control that drop of true dragon blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the blood sea, the battle cries grew louder and louder.</p><p>The endless amount of blood turned into a human face, but then it turned into a beast’s face and kept changing.</p><p>At this moment, the endless power in the sea of blood seemed to be about to rush out and annihilate Lu Ming’s soul. Lu Ming was trapped in endless killing intent and turned into a killing puppet.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. His soul glowed and he guarded his heart.</p><p>However, the power of the blood sea was getting stronger and stronger, and its killing intent was overwhelming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the true dragon formed by the drop of true dragon blood roared at the sky. It gave off an ancient Dragon’s might as if it was fighting against the third bloodline.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did he suddenly lose control of his bloodline? Could it be related to this drop of true dragon blood? However, how could the true dragon’s blood cause the third bloodline to mutate?”</p><p>it seems like the true dragon’s blood is the enemy of the third bloodline!</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>He guarded his heart and did not allow the endless killing intent in the third bloodline to be destroyed. Otherwise, he would really be reduced to a killing puppet forever.</p><p>However, the power from the third bloodline was too strong, completely surpassing his.</p><p>At this moment, outside, dandan was sizing up Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>He could not hear anything that was happening inside Lu Ming’s body, not even the shocking Dragon’s Roar or the terrifying battle cry. It seemed that only Lu Ming could hear it.</p><p>The only abnormality was that Lu Ming’s body was trembling non-stop. His entire body was shrouded in a blood-red light and his expression was somewhat ferocious.</p><p>“What’s wrong with this kid? Even a drop of ancestral dragon blood wouldn’t be like this, right?”</p><p>Dandan mumbled to herself and paced around Lu Ming, wanting to help him but not knowing how to intervene.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body had entered a critical stage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul force was enveloped by a layer of blood Qi. Endless killing intent was constantly attacking Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent grew stronger and stronger. It was as if he would only stop after he had killed everyone in the world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, there was another wave coming from Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele emerged on its own and grew to a hundred thousand feet tall, emitting endless light.</p><p>Of course, all of this was Lu Ming’s own feeling. The people outside could not see it.</p><p>The words on the prison-suppressing stele shone even brighter. Finally, three words emerged from the stele and pressed down on the third bloodline.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The third bloodline’s blood waves surged into the sky and attacked the three words.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele’s huge body pressed down. It grew bigger and bigger, standing above the blood sea. A mysterious energy kept pouring into the blood sea..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
