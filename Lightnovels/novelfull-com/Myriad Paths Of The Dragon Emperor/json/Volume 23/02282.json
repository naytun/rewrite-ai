In the end, Lu Ming’s spear pierced through his head and destroyed his soul.</p><p>“Since you’ve accompanied me in my cultivation for half a year, I won’t take your world core!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. After taking away the bloody swordsman’s storage ring, he struck out with his palm and blasted a big hole in the ground. He then buried the bloody swordsman’s corpse in it.</p><p>It could also be considered as a ‘favor’ to his sparring partner for half a year, which allowed Lu Ming’s combat strength to rise by two levels.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to a secret place. He took out the storage ring of the bloody swordsman and checked it.</p><p>“This guy has quite a lot of resources!”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were at least a hundred alien crystal cores in bloody blade hand’s storage ring. They were all true Emperor realm alien crystal cores and there were dozens of world cores.</p><p>“I’ll cultivate for a while first!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to improve his cultivation.</p><p>Now, three of his nine nomological laws had reached the third realm, while the other six were at the peak of the second realm.</p><p>He should increase his cultivation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not take out the chaos gems to cultivate. Instead, he took out the world core and refined it.</p><p>After destroying the law on the world core, Lu Ming began to refine it.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was refining the heart of the world and improving his cultivation…</p><p>In two world city, in a Great Hall of the LAN family, Lan Cheng and the LAN family’s experts were having a meeting.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve entered the battlefield of true emperors again. Are you sure?”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked an old man from the LAN family.</p><p>I’m sure. Moreover, Lu Ming has been fighting against the bloody swordsman frequently!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Bloody blade artist? What’s his combat strength?”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked.</p><p>I heard that it’s a level 14 true Emperor!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“What? A rank fourteen true Emperor? Lu Ming is already able to fight with a rank 14 true Emperor. His improvement is too fast. It must be the indestructible ancient scroll, it must be!”</p><p>Lan Cheng was a little shocked, and his eyes flickered with greed.</p><p>“Pass down my order. Any expert of the LAN family who is training in the battlefield of true emperors should be killed without mercy if they encounter Lu Ming. Extract the indestructible ancient scroll from his soul!”</p><p>Lan Cheng asked with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Celestial Thearch, if word of this gets out, I’m afraid we’ll be targeted by other powerhouses!”</p><p>The elder from the LAN family said.</p><p>then don’t let anyone know. Do it in secret. Contact the Yan family and join forces with them!</p><p>Lan Cheng ordered.</p><p>One by one, Lu Ming refined dozens of world cores. His small world expanded again.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s small world grew bigger and bigger. It finally stopped when it was three hundred thousand miles in radius.</p><p>At the beginning of the breakthrough, the size of the small world was 100000 miles in radius. After each breakthrough, the length and width of the small world would increase by 100000 miles.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was at two-star true Emperor, and his small world had a radius of two hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had refined a large amount of the world-core and his cultivation had broken through again. His small world had expanded to a radius of three hundred thousand miles.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had finally improved and he had barely reached the combat strength of a rank 14 true Emperor.</p><p>He could only barely reach the fighting power of a rank 14 true Emperor and was considered weak.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He took out a chaos stone, absorbed the chaos Qi, and continued to refine and improve.</p><p>After refining five chaos gems in a row, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose to the peak of a three-star true Emperor.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming continued to refine a few more chaos gems before he stopped.</p><p>He had planned to break through in one go and become a four-star true Emperor, but he realized that it was impossible.</p><p>A four-star true Emperor was a high-stage true Emperor. There was a hurdle that he needed time to consolidate and accumulate his strength. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to break through.</p><p>now, my combat power has barely reached the level of a rank 14 true Emperor. With the fallen star bow, I can barely protect myself in the core area of the true Emperor realm. I’ll go out and hunt for alien races to train myself!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Only by fighting could one improve quickly.</p><p>If Lu Ming had stayed in two world city to cultivate instead of fighting here, he would not have made such a great improvement even if he stayed under the path-understanding ancient tree every day.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place and walked around the true Emperor’s core area in search of the alien races.</p><p>At this moment, a piece of news spread across the entire battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>The entrance to a small world suddenly appeared somewhere on the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>It was speculated that this small world might have floated in the space of eternal nothingness for countless years and connected with this space by chance, which led to the appearance of an entrance.</p><p>A small world that could float in the eternal void for countless years was at least the small world of a peak great emperor. It might even be the small world of a heavenly Emperor. Otherwise, it would have collapsed after so many years.</p><p>Only a small world created by an extremely powerful being could float in the eternal void for so many years and still exist.</p><p>If it was a small world left behind by a heavenly Emperor realm powerhouse, it was very likely to be priceless and contain Supreme treasures.</p><p>After hearing this news, all the living beings in the true Emperor battlefield were alarmed and started searching for the entrance.</p><p>Even some of the true emperors outside the battlefield of true emperors had found experts to go with to try their luck.</p><p>Bai tai also contacted some powerful true emperors and headed to the core of the battlefield.</p><p>The LAN family, the Yan family, and other major powers had also gathered their powerful forces to search for the entrance to the small world.</p><p>There was a huge plot of land in the mountains. The entrance to the small world was in this area.</p><p>But now, a large number of foreign experts were hiding around the plot of land.</p><p>“This time, I’ll take advantage of this opportunity to kill the experts of the heaven realm!”</p><p>One of the alien experts said coldly.</p><p>They had discovered the entrance to this small world earlier, but they didn’t go in to investigate immediately. Instead, they had laid an ambush here with a large number of experts, waiting for the heaven realm experts to come and kill them one by one.</p><p>The true Emperor battlefield was filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know any of this.</p><p>He concealed his aura and wandered around the core area of the true Emperor battlefield. However, after searching for a few days, he didn’t encounter a single alien race. Instead, he met a few heaven realm experts, who were all in a hurry, looking for something.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming came to a mountain range.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming stopped because he felt a strange fluctuation in the space in front of him.</p><p>“These fluctuations are extremely similar to the spatial fluctuations of the entrance to a small world. Could it be that there’s an entrance to a small world in these mountains? Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming was highly skilled and bold. He headed towards the mountains.</p><p>He had the fallen star bow and the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body, so he was naturally unafraid.</p><p>Lu Ming flew into the mountains and was naturally discovered by the alien races who were lying in ambush.</p><p>it’s a human from the heaven realm. Why is there only one? ”</p><p>“There’s actually only one of them. Fine, let’s kill this person first to avoid alerting the enemy!”</p><p>The alien race immediately sent an expert to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was flying when a streak of light suddenly rushed toward him. A jet-black Axe radiance was heading toward him.</p><p>it’s a foreign race with rank 12 combat strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
