Their figures flickered and appeared beside LAN Yun and Yan Xi. Their World Energy rolled up and swept the two of them away. They didn’t dare to stop.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded. LAN Yun and Yan Xi had come in a strong manner and even brought true Emperor realm experts to kill Lu Ming. In the end, they had to flee in a sorry state.</p><p>The true Emperor realm experts were too fast. They were far away in an instant and Lu Ming could not catch up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cast in another direction.</p><p>There, Yuan Xin was also running at Full Speed with the star River, not daring to stop at all.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly and spread his six-feathered divine wings. With a flap, he chased after Yuan Xin at an extreme speed.</p><p>How could Yuan Xin’s speed be compared to Lu Ming’s? Lu Ming caught up with him very quickly.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yuan Xin roared angrily, and the Galaxy revealed a look of fear.</p><p>Lu Ming was determined to kill them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and pointed his finger.</p><p>A huge finger shot towards Yuan Xin.</p><p>“Primal Chaos body!”</p><p>chaotic divine body! Yuan Xin roared and used his chaotic divine body. His current chaotic divine body was very different from before. It had been improved and could fuse with many nomological laws, making it shockingly powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He swung his fists continuously, trying to block Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>However, the three of them were not Lu Ming’s match previously. He was far behind by himself.</p><p>The huge finger pressed down, crushing Yuan Xin’s fist force as easily as breaking dry weeds.</p><p>Yuan Xin’s body trembled violently, and she retreated frantically, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>The star River was also swept away by the aftershock and was sent flying, causing his injuries to worsen.</p><p>“Lu Ming, my master is the celestial Thearch …”</p><p>Xing Chen roared. He was really afraid that he would be killed by Lu Ming here.</p><p>“Is there any point in revealing the person behind this?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and strode forward, wanting to be the first to kill Heng Xinghe.</p><p>Xing Chen endured his injuries, unwilling to be killed just like that, and retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not give him the chance. He pointed his finger and a sharp finger force pierced through the void and shot toward Xing Chen’s glabella.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Xing Chen roared because he couldn’t block it at all. He was going to be killed by this move.</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>This ray of light was like a shield. Lu Ming’s finger force bombarded it but it had no effect at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, from a distance, a large hand reached out.</p><p>The hand was huge and fast. The aura it gave off was terrifying.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This huge hand exuded the pressure of the heavenly Dao. It was unbelievably powerful.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Xing Chen shouted in excitement.</p><p>His master had also come to yaoguang ancient city, and he knew that he would be fine.</p><p>However, the huge hand did not attack Lu Ming and the rest. It grabbed the Heng Xing River and Yuan Xin, then retreated rapidly and disappeared. The surrounding people all let out a long breath.</p><p>The celestial Emperor’s pressure was too strong. Even from a distance, a large hand could make people feel like a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>On the other side of yaoguang ancient city, in a luxurious and huge courtyard, the figures of Heng Xinghe and Yuan Xin appeared. In front of them was a gray-robed old man who stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Thank you for saving me, master!”</p><p>Xinghe quickly expressed his thanks.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Yuan Xin also bowed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder nodded.</p><p>“Master, you should’ve killed Lu Ming. He’s so arrogant that he doesn’t even care about you!”</p><p>The eternal Star River channel wanted to persuade the old man to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The old man shouted coldly, his eyes emitting a shocking light.</p><p>The cold aura caused Hengxing’s heart to tremble, and he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>I’m a martial sovereign, but I’m no match for an Emperor-to-be and was seriously injured. I’m already thick-skinned enough to save him. You want me, a Heavenly Sovereign, to kill a junior just because my disciple is no match for him? what would others think of me? ”</p><p>The gray-robed elder said, his eyes growing colder and colder.</p><p>Xinghe’s face turned pale and cold sweat broke out on his face.</p><p>Yuan Xin, on the other hand, lowered her head and did not dare to speak.</p><p>Although they were all top-tier heaven’s favorites, they were nothing in front of the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>They might not even be able to step into the heavenly Emperor realm in the future.</p><p>Any heavenly Emperor was an outstanding talent. When they were young, they were no worse than them.</p><p>Therefore, they didn’t have any pride in front of the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Also, do you think that the other celestial thearchs won’t care if I kill Lu Ming? The heavenly realm is currently facing a great enemy, so there are some rules. Do you understand?”</p><p>The gray-robed elder continued.</p><p>“This disciple is wrong!”</p><p>Xinghe nodded repeatedly.</p><p>“The grudges between the two of you will have to be settled by yourselves. After this matter at Mount eternal is over, go back and cultivate in seclusion. Don’t come out until you break through the true Emperor realm!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xinghe nodded, and at the same time, his eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll definitely kill you with my own hands in the future. 1 don’t believe that your combat strength will keep increasing even if you can’t become a Martial Emperor!”</p><p>The Galaxy roared in its heart.</p><p>A cold light flashed in Yuan Xin’s eyes. She had the same thought as the Heng Xing River.</p><p>In the future, he would personally cut off Lu Ming’s head and take the chaos Scripture.</p><p>“The chaos Scripture is mine!”</p><p>Yuan Xin roared in her heart.</p><p>“Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body is mine!”</p><p>The Galaxy gritted its teeth.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming also sighed.</p><p>This time, he could have killed Yuan Xin and Xing Xing River, but it was a pity that Xing Xing river’s master was in yaoguang ancient city, and all his efforts had failed.</p><p>Lu Ming could also guess that the heavenly Emperor would not be so shameless as to deal with him, a quasi-Emperor.</p><p>it’s okay. As long as you become an Emperor, dealing with these small fries will be a piece of cake!</p><p>Dandan walked over and said with a smile.</p><p>He knew very well that Lu Ming could comprehend many types of laws and even many types of ultimate laws before he became a great emperor. Once he became a great emperor, there would be shocking changes.</p><p>“Good fight, chirping!”</p><p>The bubble jumped from dandan’s shoulder to Lu Ming’s. It hung on Lu Ming’s body and rubbed against him.</p><p>“Let’s continue shopping!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The group started to stroll around the yaoguang ancient city again.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming learned from bubbles that Long Chen, Ouyang Wushuang, and the rest were still in closed-door cultivation and had not come.</p><p>After this battle, Lu Ming’s name had spread far and wide.</p><p>Before becoming a sovereign, he had already mastered many laws. It was said that he had mastered different ultimate laws and defeated Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi. Such combat strength was shocking.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming’s name had only spread among a small group of paragons. Now, many people knew about him.</p><p>However, there were also many people who did not believe it. With a skeptical attitude, they thought that it was too fake to control different ultimate maxims. They did not believe it.</p><p>Since ancient times, no one had been able to control two different ultimate maxims. This had been regarded as the truth.</p><p>How could they believe that a person who had not become a great emperor could control different ultimate maxims?</p><p>Even those who had seen Lu Ming’s moves were skeptical.</p><p>This was because when Lu Ming was fighting with LAN Yun, Yuan Xin, and the rest, he had only used chaos laws and not any other ultimate laws..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
