How did Lu Ming appear in the heaven realm now?</p><p>After the shock, there was a cold killing intent.</p><p>Luo cangqiong and Heng Xinghe were the same. They did not hide their killing intent at all. Their figures flickered and they surrounded Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, 1 didn’t expect you to come to the heaven realm. Can’t you just stay in the primordial realm and enjoy your old age? You just had to come to the heaven realm to die. That’s good, it saves me the trouble of making a special trip!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said coldly, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>A two-star illusionary Emperor seemed to have reached the peak of the two-star illusionary Emperor realm, and could become a three-star illusionary Emperor at any time!</p><p>At the same time, two kinds of laws emanated from his body. They were both King path laws, and they were both at the completion of the first realm.</p><p>Obviously, Luo cangqiong had made great progress after coming to the heaven realm.</p><p>During the battle of the ten lands, Luo cangqiong had just broken through to the one-star void Emperor realm. Now, he had reached the peak of the two-star void Emperor realm, comprehended the second kind of law, and reached the peak of the first realm.</p><p>To be able to make such progress in five years was already considered very fast. He had definitely received a large amount of resources to cultivate.</p><p>In the Martial Emperor realm, the distance between each step was extremely large and difficult to cross. If one did not have the resources and just cultivated diligently, it would take a long time.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at Luo cangqiong indifferently and said,” “I haven’t seen you for five years. You’ve made some progress, but do you think you’re my match?”</p><p>His voice was filled with disdain.</p><p>Luo cangqiong’s face turned ugly.</p><p>He did not have much confidence in going up against Lu Ming alone.</p><p>During the battle of the ten lands, Lu Ming could fight against the heaven’s pride, who had mastered the strongest law and was much stronger than him now.</p><p>To his knowledge, Lu Ming was an unparalleled cripple. If he could not become a Martial Emperor, his combat strength would not be any different from five years ago. There would not be any improvement. However, he was not Lu Ming’s match now.</p><p>However, he wasn’t afraid, because there were other people beside him.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, this isn’t the primordial realm, nor is it five years ago!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said coldly.</p><p>“Oh? Are you talking about the two of them?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently, his gaze sweeping across the galaxy and the unfamiliar young man.</p><p>“I alone am enough!”</p><p>Xing Chen spoke, showing great confidence.</p><p>The cultivation of the eternal Star River had already reached the three-star illusionary divine stage. His progress was amazing, having crossed two levels. At the same time, his nomological laws had also made amazing progress. His combat strength was much stronger than it had been five years ago in the battle of ten lands.</p><p>The eternal Star River was no longer any weaker than the heaven realm’s proud sons of heaven who had descended upon the primordial realm.</p><p>His talent was very strong, no weaker than those heaven realm’s geniuses. Now that he had received the heaven realm’s resources, his progress was rapid.</p><p>He had enough confidence that he could defeat Lu Ming alone.</p><p>he’s the peerless trash from the primordial realm?”</p><p>The unfamiliar young man said. This person’s cultivation was not weak either. He was a three-star void Emperor and controlled three types of laws. Although he did not have an ultimate law, two of his King path laws had already reached the second realm. His strength was also very shocking.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s him!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said in a cold voice.</p><p>many people have bragged about him. 1 want to see how powerful he is today!</p><p>The strange young man sneered.</p><p>“Those people who are boasting are just his friends!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die today!” Luo cangqiong sneered.</p><p>Back then, in the world of the lotus flower, Luo cangqiong had been tortured by Lu Ming. Luo pokong was killed by Lu Ming in public, and he was stepped on by Lu Ming in public. He was even treated as a human weapon and fought against the eternal Star River. He had lost all face.</p><p>He had always wanted to take revenge!</p><p>However, at the battle of the ten lands, Lu Ming’s abilities had shocked him. What happened after that made him ecstatic.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had a peerless crippled body and could not go to the heaven realm to cultivate.</p><p>He was overjoyed and decided to return to the primordial realm to kill Lu Ming with his own hands after his cultivation in the heaven realm was successful.</p><p>He did not expect to meet Lu Ming in the heaven realm. However, his desire to kill Lu Ming would not change.</p><p>“Lu Ming, give me the celestial Thearch’s corporeal body and I’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>Xing Chen said coldly. Of course, he was sending a voice transmission to Lu Ming. He did not wish for others to know about the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>In his opinion, the celestial Emperor’s corporeal body should belong to him. Anyone who touched it would have to die.</p><p>He had to kill Lu Ming too.</p><p>The three people from the star River had completely ignored dandan, guyingchong, and Mu Lan.</p><p>How powerful could he be when he was with Lu Ming, who had a crippled body?</p><p>They disdained it!</p><p>“Lu Ming, who are these three fools? You’ve been farting the moment you came!”</p><p>Dandan said unhappily.</p><p>His words made the faces of Luo cangqiong and the other two people of Xinghe River darken.</p><p>“Originally, it was none of your business, but now, you have to die as well and be responsible for your own words!”</p><p>Luo cangqiong said coldly.</p><p>nest, this kid doesn’t have any ability at all, but he’s very arrogant. I’ll kill him with one slap!</p><p>Dandan was even more displeased and rolled up her sleeves, ready to make a move.</p><p>“Leave them to me, I’ll deal with them!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and stopped dandan.</p><p>“You’ll settle it? Let’s see how you’re going to solve this!”</p><p>The unfamiliar young man said coldly. He took a step forward and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His palm was like a blade, and he slashed down with all his might. It was like a heavenly blade.</p><p>The power of his three-star illusionary Emperor world burst out completely. Three kinds of King path laws also burst out at the same time. Two of them had already reached the second realm, and their power was extremely amazing.</p><p>This attack shattered the void. The terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming, trying to cut him in half.</p><p>Countless people in the surroundings were alarmed and looked over.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change at all in the face of this attack. He was very calm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as the saber beam was about to hit Lu Ming, he made his move and pointed his finger.</p><p>A finger force hit the blade light, and the blade light shattered. The finger force didn’t stop, and it pointed at the strange young man at an amazing speed.</p><p>The strange young man’s pupils contracted sharply, and his eyes revealed a look of fear as he retreated frantically.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s finger force was even faster and caught up with the strange young man in an instant.</p><p>“No… No…”</p><p>The strange young man shouted in fear.</p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with fear and regret. He had never dreamed that Lu Ming, who was just a cripple, could be so powerful. He was even more powerful than the rumors said. His attack was actually useless.</p><p>He could feel death approaching.</p><p>He roared. He wanted to escape, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The finger force pierced through his forehead and destroyed his soul.</p><p>The unfamiliar young man’s eyes were wide open and filled with unwillingness. Then, his corpse fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>The pupils of Luo cangqiong and Xing Xing He also contracted sharply..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
