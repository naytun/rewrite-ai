There was a passageway there that led to the divine wilderness continent. Furthermore, why was the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the nine dragon veins suppressing the divine wilderness continent? why did the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron fly away separately previously?</p><p>Lu Ming asked all his doubts.</p><p>this is … evil swordsman muttered to himself for a moment, that passage was naturally formed when the heaven and Yuan worlds first opened!</p><p>“Naturally formed?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>that’s right. A naturally formed passageway is completely different from a man-made passageway. It’s very difficult to seal a naturally formed passageway completely. Even if it’s sealed, it will slowly open itself as time passes!</p><p>it’s like forcefully tearing a crack in space or opening a passage. The space will quickly heal and repair itself. A naturally formed passage is the opposite. If you want to seal or suppress it, it will naturally open and return to its original state!</p><p>Evil swordsman explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. A naturally formed passageway was naturally formed. It was fixed forever, just like any space.</p><p>You have the ability to tear apart any space, but that space will quickly recover.</p><p>It was the same for the connate passage. If you sealed it, it would naturally open.</p><p>that passageway leads to the primordial realm. Hence, in ancient times, it became an important place for the evil god tribe to attack. That’s why a peak-level battle occurred here, and a large number of peerless experts died in battle!</p><p>after that, the nine Dragons, one of the top ten Battle Beasts, entered the primordial realm and sealed the other end of the passage. On the side of the heaven realm, there were also experts who sealed the passage on this side!</p><p>however, that passageway is a passageway formed from the upper sky. No matter how it is sealed, it will slowly restore itself. Even if the person who sealed it is a rare peak expert, it can’t be sealed forever. After so many years, the seal finally can’t completely seal the passageway. The passageway is slowly opening!</p><p>Evil swordsman’s words made Lu Ming suddenly see the light. Many things that he could not figure out in the past were now clear to him.</p><p>He finally understood what the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the nine dragon veins were for. They were used by the nine Dragons to seal the passage.</p><p>He used to think that the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron just happened to have the same name as the nine Dragons. Now, it seemed that it was clearly a treasure of the nine Dragons.</p><p>More than ten years ago, the passageway slowly returned to its original state and was no longer sealed. This was why the primordial Qi became denser when the divine wilderness and heaven were connected.</p><p>The reason why the Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons had flown to the heaven realm was probably to stall for time. The Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons had flown to the heaven realm to prevent the aura from spreading and for the evil god tribe to detect it.</p><p>As expected, evil swordsman continued to speak, some time ago, the evil god tribe finally discovered the abnormality of this passageway. They sent out a few terrifying experts in an attempt to completely occupy that passageway and had a huge battle with the experts guarding the entrance. In the end, the experts guarding the passageway and the treasures left behind by the nine Dragons wanted to destroy that passageway. From the looks of it now, it hasn’t been completely destroyed!</p><p>“Senior, can the passageway be completely destroyed?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>no, it can only be destroyed for a short period of time. After a period of time, it will recover automatically. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble to seal it back then!</p><p>Evil swordsman shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Then, what should we do now?”</p><p>Lu Ming was really anxious. This involved the safety of his parents, relatives, and friends. He could not stay calm.</p><p>this passageway must not be occupied by the evil god tribe. Otherwise, all the efforts of everyone over the ages will be in vain!</p><p>Evil swordsman said, his voice cold and full of killing intent.</p><p>senior, we can send the news to two world city. They won’t sit by and do nothing!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>This was not only related to the primordial realm, but also to the heaven realm.</p><p>Once the evil god tribe entered the primordial realm, they would enter the hinterlands of the Supreme pure heaven region through the passageway of the primordial realm. Then, the heaven realm would be completely finished.</p><p>the people who came in before are all from two world city. Pass the news to them and let them pass the news to the people of two world city!</p><p>Evil swordsman nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a buzzing sound was heard.</p><p>Mu Lan, who had been quiet all this while, finally made a move.</p><p>The small tower above her head emitted a dazzling radiance. The blood in the blood pool began to squirm and flow into Mu Lan’s body.</p><p>Soon, the blood in the blood pool disappeared without a trace.</p><p>A powerful aura emanated from Mu Lan’s body.</p><p>“Emperor-to-be!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Mu Lan’s cultivation base was at the Emperor-to-be realm!</p><p>The inheritance that she had obtained was definitely the inheritance of an extremely powerful existence. It might not be as simple as a simple inheritance. Otherwise, Mu Lan would not have been able to reach the Emperor-to-be realm in just five to six years.</p><p>this little guy is so compatible with that guy’s inheritance. It’s rare!</p><p>Evil swordsman muttered.</p><p>Dandan looked on with envy.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The small blood-red Tower trembled slightly before shrinking rapidly. It flew into Mu Lan’s forehead and disappeared.</p><p>Mu Lan slowly opened her eyes. A blood-red light flashed in her eyes before it was concealed.</p><p>Her gaze swept across Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>When her gaze landed on Lu Ming, her petite body could not help but shiver and she revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>“Am I hallucinating again?”</p><p>Mu Lan mumbled. She blinked her big beautiful eyes a few times to make sure.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Senior Sister Mu Lan, long time no see. Why? don’t you recognize me?”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Mu Lan murmured with a surprised expression. She flew out of the small pool and was still in disbelief.”Junior Brother Lu Ming, why are you here?”</p><p>“Of course it’s because I’m worried about you. I miss you, so I followed that passage to find you!”</p><p>The one who spoke was not Lu Ming but dandan.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and was speechless.</p><p>Mu Lan’s face was flushed red.</p><p>two little fellows, stop flirting. It’s time to get down to business!</p><p>Evil swordsman’s words caused Mu Lan’s face to turn even redder. However, her cultivation had increased greatly, reaching the Emperor-to-be realm, and she had also obtained the inheritance of a peerless expert. Her confidence had also increased greatly, and her original personality had also been completely revealed.</p><p>She came to Lu Ming’s side and stared at him without blinking, seemingly unwilling to move her eyes away.</p><p>“Nest, it’s so mushy!”</p><p>Dandan cried out.</p><p>“Junior Brother, what happened?”</p><p>Mu Lan ignored dandan and questioned Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the passage. Mu Lan’s pretty face turned pale after hearing it. She understood the severity of the matter.</p><p>Furthermore, her family members were all in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“I’m going to rush to the passageway immediately. When I make my move, I’m afraid it’ll be dangerous for you to stay here. You should enter my small world first!”</p><p>Evil sword guest said.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll stay outside. 1 might be able to help!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. No matter what, he still had the celestial Thearch’s physical body. It might be useful at a critical moment.</p><p>“I’ll also stay outside!”</p><p>Dandan said..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
