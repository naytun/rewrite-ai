The gate of the castle was the entrance.</p><p>It was also very desolate inside, with not a single blade of grass growing. There were also some Crimson puppets scattered around.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi brought their family members and gathered together. There were about twenty of them, and there were many experts. Along the way, they killed many Crimson puppets.</p><p>At the same time, he also saw a few skeletons. However, they all belonged to the evil god race, and there were no treasures left behind.</p><p>these guys still want to deal with us. Unforgivable! They dare to go after my plan!</p><p>Behind him, he gritted his teeth, his eyes flashing with cold light.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. He thought to himself,’they have been bullied so badly by you. It’s no wonder they want to take revenge.’</p><p>However, Lu Ming was also thinking of how to get rid of LAN Yun and the rest without anyone knowing. He knew that dandan was thinking of a plan and immediately asked,”What idea do you have?”</p><p>let’s lure the evil god race over and let them fight amongst themselves. What do you think?”</p><p>Dandan suggested.</p><p>“Great minds think alike. Let’s go!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, the two ‘heroes’ sneaked in the direction of the evil god tribe.</p><p>The two of them completely concealed their auras and carefully avoided the blood puppets. Not long after, they saw a group of evil god tribe members, b * stard of the evil god race, die!</p><p>Dandan let out a loud roar and rushed over. Even from a distance, she clapped her hands repeatedly, and countless runes condensed into a few sword lights that slashed toward the evil god race.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two high-level void emperors and one one-star true Emperor were killed instantly.</p><p>From afar, Lu Ming took out the fallen star bow and shot two arrows consecutively, killing two evil god tribe’s void thearchs.</p><p>“Heaven realm trash, kill!”</p><p>The evil god tribe was enraged.</p><p>There was a blood feud between the two races and they would not rest until one of them was dead. Now, Lu Ming and dandan actually dared to take the initiative to kill their people. They were simply courting death.</p><p>Instantly, the group of evil god tribe members charged toward dandan and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Dandan shouted loudly, turned around, and ran. Six divine wings appeared behind him, and his speed was astonishing.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had already put away the fallen star bow and spread out his six-feathered divine wings. He flew rapidly in the direction of LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>Not long after, he saw LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>“LAN Yun, quickly come and help us!”</p><p>let’s kill those evil god race bastards together!</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan shouted and rushed toward LAN Yun and the rest.</p><p>LAN Yun and the others were carefully exploring when they suddenly heard a few shouts. Looking towards the source of the sound, LAN Yun immediately wanted to curse.</p><p>He saw Lu Ming and dandan shouting and rushing over. Behind them, there was a group of evil god tribe members. There were more than twenty of them.</p><p>“You guys … Quickly get lost!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed.</p><p>Naturally, he did not recognize Lu Ming and his partner as they had disguised themselves.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan did not seem to have heard LAN Yun’s words. They continued to shout and rush towards LAN Yun and the rest.</p><p>When he rushed into LAN Yun’s group, dandan shouted,” kill that evil god race b * stard!</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>The members of the evil god tribe roared in anger and started to attack.</p><p>In their opinion, the people of the heaven realm were all in the same group.</p><p>Immediately, two of the LAN clan’s illusionary thearchs were killed by the evil god tribe.</p><p>The LAN family and Yan family had no choice but to fight back and fight against the evil god race.</p><p>However, the LAN family and the Yan family had indeed sent many experts. There was one advanced true Emperor each and they were all six-star true emperors.</p><p>On the evil god tribe’s side, there was only one six-star true Emperor and two other five-star true emperors. They were suppressed by them in an instant.</p><p>The battle between the two sides was unusually brutal, and people were constantly killed.</p><p>Lu Ming and dandan flickered in the crowd at an astonishing speed, avoiding the attacks.</p><p>In the end, the Yan clan and the LAN clan’s top forces were even stronger. A six-star true Emperor had killed two five-star true emperors of the evil god tribe. Then, he joined forces with another six-star true Emperor to kill the six-star true Emperor of the evil god tribe. In the end, the six-star true Emperor of the evil god tribe was killed even though he was seriously injured.</p><p>As soon as the six-star true Emperor died, he was no longer able to resist and scattered. The experts of the LAN family and the Yan family chased after him and killed him.</p><p>In this battle, they had killed all the evil god tribe members. However, the LAN and Yan families had also suffered heavy losses.</p><p>More than ten of them had died in battle, and a few of them were heavily injured. Even the six-star true Emperor had been severely injured and had been counterattacked by the evil god tribe before his death.</p><p>LAN Yun’s and Yan Xi’s faces were so dark that they were about to drop. They looked at Lu Ming and dandan with murderous intent in their eyes.</p><p>It was all Lu Ming and dandan’s fault. If the two of them had not brought the evil god race, they would not have suffered such a great loss.</p><p>At this time, figures flickered not far away, and people from the other heaven realms rushed over. They had obviously heard the sound of fighting and rushed over.</p><p>thank you for saving us. Otherwise, we would have been in danger. We, the people of heaven realm, should help each other!</p><p>Before LAN Yun and the others could speak, dandan had already spoken. With one sentence, she tied them together, making it difficult for LAN Yun and the others to flare up.</p><p>LAN Yun and Yan Xi felt a tightness in their chest and almost vomited blood.</p><p>Dandan was the first to express her gratitude and tie them all to the heaven realm. There was a rule in two world city that on the battlefield, the creatures of the heaven realm were not allowed to kill each other. They had to fight against the enemy together.</p><p>They really could not find a reason to deal with Lu Ming and dandan. Furthermore, there were other people coming.</p><p>“You two, stay away from us!”</p><p>LAN Yun gritted his teeth as he spoke. He then ordered people to keep the storage bracelets left behind by the evil god race’s people and left this place.</p><p>“What a pity, what a pity!”</p><p>Dandan sighed. It was a pity that the evil god tribe’s people were unable to kill LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming also felt that it was a pity.</p><p>“Why don’t we try again?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>you’ve turned bad, kid. But 1 like it. Hehehe …!</p><p>Dandan had a wicked smile on her face.</p><p>Immediately, the two of them sneakily followed behind LAN Yun and the others.</p><p>This time, LAN Yun and the rest were much more cautious. They looked around, but Lu Ming and his partner’s technique of concealing their aura was too brilliant. They did not notice them at all.</p><p>After secretly observing for a while, the two of them rushed toward the evil god tribe.</p><p>After a while, the two of them rushed towards LAN Yun’s group while yelling and shouting.</p><p>“Nest, it’s you guys again. F * ck…”</p><p>As soon as LAN Yun saw Lu Ming and the rest, he immediately broke out in curses because he was really very angry.</p><p>After that, LAN Yun and the others also turned around and ran. This time, they were no longer fools.</p><p>nest, he actually ran away. Help!</p><p>Dandan ‘screamed’ and chased after LAN Yun and the rest with Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>“You guys get lost…”</p><p>LAN Yun roared at the two of them.</p><p>“We’re all from the heaven realm, but you guys just watched us die!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“Don’t drag us down with you if you want to die!”</p><p>LAN Yun bellowed.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Dandan and Lu Ming chased after LAN Yun and the others relentlessly, followed by a wave of evil god tribe members. All of their eyes were red, and they wished they could tear dandan, Lu Ming, and the others into pieces..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
