Secondly, he could kill his opponents and weaken them. He could also obtain rewards.</p><p>In the heaven realm, the rules were that if one hunted alien races and took their crystal cores, they would be rewarded.</p><p>There were also corresponding rewards for the alien races. Killing the heaven realm’s powerhouses would also give them rewards.</p><p>The battlefield of true emperors was a battle between true emperors.</p><p>B0x𝔫𝙤ѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>It was the same for the battlefield of great emperors!</p><p>Moreover, for so many years, there had been an unspoken rule between the two sides that true Emperor powerhouses were not allowed to enter the battlefield of the empty emperors.</p><p>Great emperor experts couldn’t enter the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>However, a void Emperor could enter the battlefield of true emperors, the battlefield of great emperors, as long as you were not afraid of death.</p><p>If those of higher cultivation could enter the battlefields of those of lower cultivation, then these battlefields would be meaningless.</p><p>“If you send people with higher cultivation bases into the battlefields of lower cultivation bases to kill people with lower cultivation bases, then we can also send people. In that case, these battlefields would have no meaning to exist.</p><p>After Lu Ming watched it once, he more or less had some understanding of the battlefield outside. He then walked out of two world city.</p><p>At a relatively remote part of the city wall, there were people guarding it. At the same time, a door of light was opened, allowing one to enter and leave the two world city freely.</p><p>Of course, there was a formation here. If any foreign tribe tried to sneak in, they would be immediately identified and killed by the experts guarding the place.</p><p>Lu Ming went through the door of light and arrived outside two world city.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming retracted his aura and dashed in one direction while sticking close to the ground.</p><p>The first place Lu Ming wanted to go was the illusionary Emperor battlefield.</p><p>His speed was very fast, like a shadow sweeping across the ground. After running for a long distance, Lu Ming finally entered the battlefield of the empty emperors.</p><p>Lu Ming slowed down after entering the illusionary Emperor battlefield. However, he did not conceal his aura after arriving here. Instead, he completely revealed his aura.</p><p>This was merely the battlefield of the illusionary thearchs. The strongest being was the illusionary Thearch, so Lu Ming was not afraid at all.</p><p>Now that he was a five-star void Emperor, he was not afraid of anyone within the void Emperor realm.</p><p>The reason why he released his aura was to attract the foreign races to hunt him down.</p><p>Lu Ming fully released the aura of a five-star illusionary Emperor. Then, he walked slowly on the battlefield, waiting for a big fish to take the bait.</p><p>Lu Ming walked for a while. Not far away, five figures were hidden on a mountain peak.</p><p>These five figures were all from the heaven realm. They saw Lu Ming from afar. “What’s up with that kid? He’s actually releasing his aura on the battlefield. He’s simply courting death!”</p><p>this kid must be a hothead. It must be his first time on the battlefield. He thinks that he’s amazing just because he has the cultivation of a five-star void Emperor. 1 don’t know how many people can kill him in this battlefield!</p><p>A few of them mocked.</p><p>no, we’re both from the heaven realm. We can’t just leave him to die. 1 think he has no experience. It’s his first time on the battlefield. Let’s go and remind him!</p><p>A middle-aged man said. He had a square face and looked very righteous.</p><p>After saying that, he flew out, and the others followed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows when he heard the commotion. He looked toward the group and was disappointed.</p><p>It turned out to be someone from the heaven realm. He had thought that they were from a different race.</p><p>“Little brother, this must be your first time coming to the battlefield of the empty Thearch!”</p><p>The square-faced man said.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>little brother, it’s too dangerous for you to release your aura like this. It’s equivalent to exposing yourself to the enemy. Soon, many powerful warriors of the foreign races will be attracted here. Restrain your aura, find a place to ambush, or act secretly. Only then can you kill the foreign races!</p><p>The square-faced man kindly advised.</p><p>“Thank you, big brother. I know what to do.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left.</p><p>However, he still didn’t hide his aura.</p><p>he’s so stubborn. He’s really looking for death. I guess he’s a disciple of some big family. He thinks he can look down on others just because he has some strength!</p><p>you must know that some peak void emperors have lived for a long time and their fighting strength is comparable to that of an ordinary true Emperor. Even if he is a genius, he will still die!</p><p>The other people said unhappily.</p><p>who cares? we’ve already warned him. He’s just too arrogant. He deserves to die. Let’s go!</p><p>A skinny old man was the most unhappy and mocked.</p><p>They returned to the mountain peak where they had laid in ambush.</p><p>However, the square-faced man was still frowning, as if he couldn’t bear to do it.</p><p>After a while, the square-faced man said,” no, that young man has reached the level of a five-star void Emperor at such a young age. He is definitely a top heaven’s pride expert. When he grows up in the future, our heaven realm may have another top expert. It would be a great loss if he were to die just like that. I’ve decided to persuade him and warn him again!</p><p>“You’re still going? That kind of person, if we don’t make him suffer, he won’t wake up. He’ll still think he’s the best in the world!”</p><p>The skinny old man said.</p><p>“Although that’s the case, we’re all from the heaven realm, so I have to remind you. Let’s go!”</p><p>After the square-faced man finished speaking, he flew in the direction that Lu Ming had left.</p><p>The square-faced man was obviously quite dignified. Although the others were unwilling, they still followed him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not conceal his aura at all and continued to move forward.</p><p>Previously, although the square-faced man and the rest had good intentions, they did not understand Lu Ming’s combat strength at all.</p><p>“Why haven’t the foreign races been attracted yet?”</p><p>Lu Ming grumbled. Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He saw a large mountain peak in front of him.</p><p>These mountain peaks were filled with grotesque rocks and rugged terrain, and ancient trees towered into the sky. They were the most suitable for an ambush.</p><p>Perhaps, there was a foreign race hidden here.</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the mountain peaks.</p><p>Lu Ming’s guess was right. There were indeed powerhouses from the alien races lying in ambush in this mountain.</p><p>Moreover, the alien races had already discovered Lu Ming.</p><p>hehe, it’s someone from the heaven realm. This kid is most likely a hothead. He actually dares to swagger around here. He’s really looking for death!</p><p>he’s young, but his cultivation isn’t weak. He must be a heaven’s favorite. The rewards for killing a heaven’s favorite are quite good!</p><p>There were at least a dozen alien races hiding on a mountain. They were all transmitting their voices in excitement.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>When Lu Ming got close, one of the evil god race members shouted. More than ten evil god race members rushed out of the mountain and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s finally here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>At this time, the square-faced man and the others finally arrived nearby. They were a long distance away, but their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>“Not good! It’s the alien race. That kid is ambushed!”</p><p>“I told you he’s looking for death. Let’s go, or we’ll die too!”</p><p>The skinny man and the others shouted and tried to escape.</p><p>That was because the evil god race had also discovered them.</p><p>The square-faced man revealed a complicated expression. He gritted his teeth and was about to escape.</p><p>If they didn’t escape, they would all die!</p><p>However, at this moment, he was stunned. The others were also stunned. Their bodies froze in the air.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming made his move at this moment..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
