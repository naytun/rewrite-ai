He understood that there was a huge difference between them.</p><p>Three types of second realm, nine types of Third Realm. This difference was truly shocking.</p><p>the weakest true Emperor has a one star cultivation and can control three types of second realm laws. A peak true Emperor has a Seven Star cultivation and can control nine types of Third Realm laws. The difference in strength is too shocking. It’s impossible to accurately distinguish a true Emperor’s battle strength by just relying on one star, two star, and three star!</p><p>therefore, in ancient times, our ancestors made a more detailed division of the true Emperor realm, which is the division of combat strength. According to combat strength, the true Emperor realm is divided into 18 levels!</p><p>“This is the battle power of a rank 18 true Emperor!”</p><p>B0x𝔫𝙤ѵ𝑒𝙡.com</p><p>Bai tai explained.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood.</p><p>the true Emperor has actually divided his battle strength into 18 ranks!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed with emotion.</p><p>for example, those who have just broken through to the true Emperor realm and can only control three types of second realm laws are the weakest stage one true Emperor. Of course, there are strong and weak people at the same stage. Some people can control the strongest law, some can control the king path law, and some can control the ordinary law. There are also magical powers that affect one’s combat power!</p><p>furthermore, those who have mastered three types of second level laws and one or two types of first level laws would also have the combat power of a first stage true Emperor!</p><p>similarly, those who can control four to five types of second realm laws and have, cultivation base of a one-star true Emperor would have the battle power of a second stage true Emperor …</p><p>in short, the division is very complicated. 1 can’t explain it in a few words. 1’11 give you a jade talisman with a detailed division of the true Emperor realm’s combat strength. Take a look!</p><p>Bai tai took out a jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you, senior white!”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He read it carefully.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming put down the Jade talisman. He had finally understood the combat strength of the true Emperor realm.</p><p>At the true Emperor realm, nomological laws affected one’s combat power the most. However, cultivation, which was also the power of the world, the strength of the physical body, and divine arts, could also affect one’s combat power.</p><p>Therefore, the total combat strength was divided into 18 levels.</p><p>The two members of the evil god race that they had killed previously had the combat power of a fifth stage true Emperor.</p><p>After some comparison, Lu Ming estimated that he had the combat power of a fourth stage true Emperor.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the five-star illusionary Emperor stage, his physical body was very strong, which could make up for the lack of cultivation level.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming controlled nine types of laws. However, three of them were ultimate laws. If they were transformed into divine abilities, the attack power would be extremely shocking. In addition, his chaos laws had already reached the second realm. That was why he had the combat power of a fourth stage true Emperor.</p><p>It was already extremely shocking.</p><p>In history, there had never been a five-star illusionary Emperor who had reached the battle strength of a fourth stage true Emperor.</p><p>The strongest one was only equivalent to a first stage true Emperor.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also understood that although his combat strength was only at the fourth stage of the true Emperor realm, with the help of the indestructible ancient scroll, Lu Ming could fight against a fifth stage true Emperor. He could even exhaust his opponent to death. The previous battle was enough to prove this.</p><p>“My battle power is at the seventh stage true Emperor realm!”</p><p>Bai tai informed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was no wonder that the other party could easily kill an evil god race member who had the combat power of a fifth stage true Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, in the battlefield of true emperors, only the strong would dare to enter. Usually, the weakest would have the combat power of a fourth stage true Emperor. The weaker ones would not dare to enter, as they would be easily killed!”</p><p>Bai tai said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It seemed that his combat strength was the weakest in the battlefield of true emperors.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not worried. On the contrary, it would stimulate his fighting spirit even more.</p><p>Only in such an environment would he be able to break through faster.</p><p>In the previous battle, Lu Ming had sensed that he would soon make a breakthrough in the death law and the array Dao law.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had many trump cards, such as the fallen star bow and the celestial Thearch’s physical body. If he were to encounter a perverted true Emperor, he would have no worries about protecting himself.</p><p>Lu Ming, why don’t the two of us join forces and hunt down the evil god tribe together? what do you think?”</p><p>Bai tai suggested.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p>First of all, he felt that Bai tai was a good person and didn’t seem like a sinister person. Furthermore, he was indeed very unfamiliar with the true Emperor battlefield. It would be better for him to work with Bai tai to hunt down the evil god race.</p><p>alright. However, the periphery of the true Emperor battlefield is also extremely dangerous. There are many experts, and we can’t just barge in. Let’s find a place to set up an ambush first and see if we can ambush the evil god tribe!</p><p>Lu Ming had no objections to Bai Tai’s suggestion.</p><p>The two of them left the place and found a hidden place. Bai tai took out a piece of black cloth and covered the two of them. Suddenly, they became one with the rocks around them. The color was exactly the same, and it was impossible to tell.</p><p>Moreover, this cloth had the ability to conceal one’s aura. If one didn’t get close, one wouldn’t be able to detect it.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. It seemed that those who were active on the battlefield all year round had unique tricks.</p><p>The two of them waited.</p><p>In the first two days, there was no movement at all. They didn’t see any alien races or even any living beings from the heaven realm.</p><p>It wasn’t until the third day that there was some movement!</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Bai Tai’s eyes brightened as he looked to the North.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over as well and saw three figures traveling on the ground. They were not fast and they were very secretive. If one did not look closely, one would not be able to tell.</p><p>They were from the evil god tribe.</p><p>Two of them were from the evil god race, and one of them was skinny and had four arms.</p><p>The three members of the evil god race were extremely careful as they surveyed their surroundings in case they were ambushed.</p><p>“Senior, should we make a move?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Bai tai.</p><p>“Attack, but don’t rush out rashly. We need a plan!”</p><p>Bai tai said.</p><p>It was very difficult to judge the strength of a true Emperor’s combat power without fighting.</p><p>The true Emperor realm was different from the other realms. For other realms, one could more or less judge it based on the strength of one’s cultivation, but it was hard to say for the true Emperor realm.</p><p>Some people’s cultivation levels were low, but their nomological laws were shockingly strong, so their battle prowess was naturally also shocking.</p><p>Thus, in the battlefield of true emperors, luck was sometimes very important.</p><p>For example, if you were to ambush someone, and if you were unlucky and met with an existence with terrifying combat strength, you could only admit that you were unlucky.</p><p>Therefore, it was difficult for them to determine the strength of the three evil god tribe members.</p><p>If it was in the past, Bai tai wouldn’t have attacked them because it was too risky. But now, he decided to attack.</p><p>how about this? you don’t attack first. I’ll attack first and test the other party’s combat strength. If the other party’s combat strength is stronger than mine, you can use that bow and arrow to suppress the other party. We’ll retreat!</p><p>“If the enemy’s combat strength is within our ability to deal with, we will attack together and kill them!”</p><p>Bai tai suggested.</p><p>“Senior, Won’t You Be in danger if you do this …”</p><p>Lu Ming said, feeling touched.</p><p>He understood that Bai tai was trying to protect him. If the other party’s combat strength was too terrifying and far above them, Bai tai would be in danger if he rushed out. However, Lu Ming would at least survive.</p><p>“On the battlefield, how can there be no danger at all?”</p><p>Bai tai smiled..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
