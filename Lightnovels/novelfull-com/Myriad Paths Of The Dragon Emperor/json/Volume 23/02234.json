It was as if a God had extended three fingers.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming used five types of laws. There was one more than the previous one and it was more powerful.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three fingers collided with the attacks of Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi.</p><p>The mountain formed by Yuan Xin shook violently and then exploded.</p><p>LAN Yun had used his divine power to form a giant lion. It wailed and exploded. Yan Xi’s blade light shattered.</p><p>The terrifying power surged towards the three of them, and they retreated. Their bodies trembled as if they had been electrocuted, and blood spurted out of their mouths.</p><p>With the addition of a law, Lu Ming’s attack power was greatly increased. He injured Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi in one move.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were dumbfounded. He could not believe what he was seeing.</p><p>Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi had all become four-star void emperors. They were all high-level void emperors.</p><p>Furthermore, they were all top talents and their combat strength could not be measured by their cultivation. However, the three of them had surrounded Lu Ming and were injured by him in one move.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming had not become an Emperor yet.</p><p>He was not an Emperor-to-be yet, but he could cross so many levels of cultivation and suppress the three top heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Everyone felt like they were going crazy, because this had broken common sense and had never happened before.</p><p>Even geniuses like Yuan Xin, LAN Yun, and Yan Xi were suppressed by Lu Ming. If an ordinary void Emperor went up, he would be killed by Lu Ming in seconds.</p><p>Wouldn’t lu Ming be able to suppress ordinary five-star or even six-star illusionary emperors?</p><p>This was simply too crazy.</p><p>However, this was still far from Lu Ming’s strongest combat power. If they knew that Lu Ming had still kept a large amount of combat power, they would definitely be shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with what the others thought. At this moment, he continued to attack Yuan Xin and the other two.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to point his fingers at the three of them.</p><p>The three of them bellowed in anger and unleashed all their strength to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>It could be seen that Yuan Xin was indeed stronger, and her combat strength was above LAN Yun and Yan Xi. Her injuries were also lighter.</p><p>However, it was not much stronger and was still crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With three loud bangs, the three of them were forced back and spat out blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and activated his six-feathered divine wings. In a flash, he appeared before LAN Yun.</p><p>LAN Yun was greatly alarmed. His entire body emitted light, and an enormous Lion pounced out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm was covered with five different radiances as it clashed with the giant lion’s palm.</p><p>The giant lion’s palm was shattered immediately and the palm continued to hit the giant lion’s head. The giant lion’s huge body exploded inch by inch and finally exploded with a loud bang. Lu Ming’s palm did not stop and continued to slap LAN Yun’s body.</p><p>LAN Yun let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was pierced through. He spat out a large mouthful of blood, and his body flew out like a broken sandbag.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The true emperors who had surrounded dandan and Mu Lan immediately roared in anger and wanted to save LAN Yun.</p><p>“You can come and go as you please, have you asked this Lord?”</p><p>Dandan said coldly. Then, he moved like a bolt of lightning and charged at the true emperors.</p><p>With a wave of dandan’s hand, nine colors emanated from her body. That was the eruption of nine types of nomological laws at the same time.</p><p>Furthermore, all nine types of nomological laws were at the second level. Some had even reached the third level.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The true emperors were shocked. Dandan’s combat power made their hearts tremble.</p><p>There were a total of five true emperors, and the highest one had even reached the level of a five-star true Emperor.</p><p>The true emperors attacked at the same time and charged toward dandan.</p><p>There were a few true emperors who had extremely shocking battle power and profound mastery of their laws. However, they were still lacking compared to dandan.</p><p>Dandan was fighting one against five, but she was not at a disadvantage at all. She even had the upper hand.</p><p>This shocked the others.</p><p>They had never expected that this ordinary-looking young Daoist would be so strong.</p><p>Not only had his cultivation reached the true Emperor level, but his combat strength was also ridiculously strong.</p><p>It was obvious that the cultivation base that dandan revealed was only that of a one-star true Emperor. However, his battle prowess was shockingly high. Even a five-star true Emperor wasn’t his match and was suppressed by him.</p><p>his nomological laws are too terrifying. A one-star true Emperor has already cultivated nine types of nomological laws to such a realm. It’s incredible!</p><p>Some of the older generation sighed.</p><p>For a void Emperor or a true Emperor, the deciding factor of one’s combat power was the laws.</p><p>Although cultivation could also affect one’s combat power, it was not as significant as nomological laws.</p><p>This was especially true for those at the true Emperor realm. The number of nomological laws they controlled and the strength of their mastery would greatly affect their combat power.</p><p>Many people might not be able to cultivate nomological laws to such a level even after cultivating for hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</p><p>This was talent!</p><p>The true emperors of the LAN family and Yan family were being held back by dandan and couldn’t be rescued.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared beside Yan Xi again. He struck a palm and Yan Xi followed in LAN Yun’s footsteps, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>you want to kill me. Today, I’ll kill you all!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his voice icy.</p><p>He knew that the LAN family and the Yan family were both powerful families in the heaven realm. They had deep foundations and definitely had a Celestial Emperor.</p><p>If he killed LAN Yun and Yan Xi, he would be in big trouble.</p><p>However, the other party had tried to kill him time and time again, which made Lu Ming want to kill them. If worse came to worst, he would just kill them and find a place to hide or go to the Gu family to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Although LAN Yun and Yan Xi were seriously injured, they were not dead yet. At this moment, they were so frightened that they were trembling all over. They used all the strength in their bodies and retreated frantically. At the same time, he shouted,”come and save me!.”</p><p>“Junior, you dare!”</p><p>With a loud roar, a burly old man rushed out of the crowd, picked up a giant hammer, and smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“True Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He did not dare to take it head-on. His six-feathered divine wings flashed and he dodged the Hammer’s attack.</p><p>“Kill him! Kill him!”</p><p>LAN Yun recognized that it was an expert from the Yan family and immediately shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly old man held a giant hammer and charged at Lu Ming, wanting to kill him.</p><p>you’re a true Emperor, yet you’re attacking a quasi Emperor. You’re so f * eking shameless. I’ll be your opponent!</p><p>Dandan roared and struck out a few times in succession. His attack method was very special. All the laws were transformed into runes, which could then condense into all kinds of terrifying attacks with shocking power.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two true emperors in front of dandan immediately spat out mouthfuls of blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>Dandan, on the other hand, charged towards the burly old man.</p><p>so what if you have a giant hammer? look at my hammer, smash!</p><p>Dandan shouted, raised her fist, and smashed it towards the other party.</p><p>As his fist smashed down, symbols filled the air, and a huge hammer even larger than his opponent’s took shape. It smashed down with a loud bang.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two big hammers collided and the void trembled. The burly old man’s body shook violently and his arm exploded. He spat out blood and retreated.</p><p>“Save the young master!”</p><p>The true emperors who had besieged dandan previously finally broke free and rushed towards LAN Yun and Yan Xi..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
