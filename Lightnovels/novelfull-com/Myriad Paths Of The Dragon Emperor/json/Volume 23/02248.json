It was his strongest attack at the moment and its power was shocking.</p><p>The long spear struck the giant tower, causing it to shake continuously before it was sent flying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming himself was also sent flying. His hands were covered in wounds and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, Lu Ming circulated the life law and his injuries were healing rapidly. Hmph!</p><p>After being continuously blocked by Lu Ming, ou yabing revealed a look of displeasure and let out a cold snort.</p><p>He was known as the strongest void Emperor among the younger generation of the heaven realm.</p><p>Even many void emperors who had lived for a long time were not his match. “Again!”</p><p>The light on ou yabing’s palm grew even brighter. Following that, another weapon appeared.</p><p>This was a flower vase, not a physical entity, but also condensed from the laws and the power of the world.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! ou yabing shouted. The giant Pagoda once again came crashing down on Lu Ming. At the same time, the mouth of the vase emitted a brilliant glow. Then, streams of sword Qi burst out from the mouth of the vase.</p><p>The boundless sword Qi was incomparably sharp. It cut through the space and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in his hand. The law of chaos and the law of death kept colliding with each other in the spear, triggering a terrifying power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear swept out once again and blocked the attack of the giant Pagoda. However, the sword Qi followed and slashed over with great power.</p><p>Although Lu Ming tried to block it with his long spear, he could not block it at all.</p><p>BOOM! boom! BOOM!</p><p>The spear in Lu Ming’s hand shattered with a series of explosive sounds. He retreated at top speed, but he was still swept by the sword light. His body was almost torn apart and sword wounds appeared. The destructive force continued to drill into Lu Ming’s body, destroying his physical body.</p><p>Even though he had circulated the life law, Lu Ming’s injuries could only recover slowly.</p><p>five types of second realm laws, one of the strongest laws is the law of nothingness, and there are four types of King path laws!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally had a clear look at ou yabing’s ability.</p><p>Ou yabing had actually comprehended five types of nomological laws, and all of them had reached the second realm. Coupled with his cultivation as a seven-star illusionary Emperor, his combat strength was terrifying.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s combat strength is ultimately limited!”</p><p>Someone shook his head.</p><p>haha, he’s finally going to be defeated. If he doesn’t become a saint Emperor, he’s still a waste!</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others laughed.</p><p>“This is your limit? If you don’t become a monarch, you’re just an ant that can’t withstand a single blow. I, on the other hand, can break through at any time and become a True Monarch. At that time, I can kill you with a single thought!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, just accept your fate. The indestructible ancient scroll isn’t something you can control!”</p><p>Ou yabing spoke coldly. He was filled with an air of superiority.</p><p>“Become Emperor, become Emperor, isn’t it just become Emperor? Then 1’11 become a divine Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and his last words turned into a long howl.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A shocking aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. The life law circulated rapidly and the injuries on his body recovered rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming controlled the nine types of laws and they entered his Saint heart.</p><p>The nine types of laws were arranged in a circle.</p><p>An ultimate law separated by two King path laws, then another ultimate law, then two King path laws.</p><p>The nine types of nomological laws were separated from each other and reached a balance. They burst forth with boundless radiance and began to evolve the world core.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming was about to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to find a place to consolidate his cultivation before breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm. In that case, he would be more confident.</p><p>However, Lu Ming understood that he had no choice but to break through to the divine Emperor realm in advance.</p><p>Once he broke through to the sovereign realm, he would be an unparalleled heaven’s favorite with unparalleled potential. Let’s see how Lan Cheng and the others would deal with him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body emitted an unparalleled dazzling radiance. A terrifying force burst forth and blasted ou ye’s weapon away.</p><p>“Breakthrough, he wants to breakthrough!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>he’s courting death. He’s trying to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. He’ll end up like the ancient people. His Saint heart will be shattered and his body will be torn apart!</p><p>he’s overestimating himself. Does he really think he can create a miracle? ”</p><p>Lan Cheng and the others spoke one after another, their voices filled with disdain.</p><p>Ou yabing stopped in the distance and did not continue to attack.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was trying his best to break through to the next realm. The power of law surged and the power he exerted was very shocking. He could not get close to him at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu and the other heavenly emperors from the primordial realm all looked worried.</p><p>They all thought that Lu Ming was forced to break through to the martial Supreme realm in such an environment in order to fight for a chance of survival.</p><p>However, they did not know that Lu Ming was confident. He did not attempt to break through without any confidence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must succeed!”</p><p>Mu Lan clenched her fists tightly. Although she knew that Lu Ming had obtained the method that Gu Lingtian had left behind, she was still very nervous.</p><p>In addition, the Gu family was the same!</p><p>After all, no one had ever tried Gu Lingtian’s method, so no one knew if it would succeed.</p><p>“Lu Ming will definitely succeed!”</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were bright as she stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had undoubtedly become the focus of everyone’s attention. Everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>Although many people who had no grudges with Lu Ming felt that the chances of him succeeding were very low, they still held on to a glimmer of hope and hoped that Lu Ming would succeed.</p><p>He was already so amazing even before he became a monarch. Once he became a monarch, his future achievements would be limitless. It was definitely beneficial to the heaven realm.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s Saint heart was undergoing a shocking change.</p><p>The nine types of laws formed a ring shape and burst forth with boundless power. The bright radiance was like a small sun.</p><p>The nine types of laws formed a wonderful balance. Their powers linked up with each other and seemed to be evolving towards the world core.</p><p>This time, there was no energy leaking out to tear Lu Ming’s Saint heart and physical body.</p><p>This was because the nine types of nomological laws were in a balanced arrangement, and their powers offset each other.</p><p>If Lu Ming had only mastered two ultimate maxims, one of which was the king path, the balance would not be formed. The power would burst out and tear Lu Ming’s Saint heart and physical body apart.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine types of laws trembled as if they were about to merge into one.</p><p>At this moment, thin threads that were thousands of times thinner than hair spread out from here and extended to various parts of the Saint heart.</p><p>These were law threads. They were extremely thin and invisible to the naked eye, but they were indeed the foundation of a world.</p><p>The law threads spread to the entire Saint heart. Every inch of it was covered by the law threads.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>When the law threads enveloped his entire Saint heart, his Saint heart began to shake and undergo earth-shaking changes.</p><p>Some parts of his Saint heart were collapsing, but it immediately recovered.</p><p>His Saint heart began to transform into a small world.</p><p>With the world core as the core and the Saint heart as the shell, a small world would be developed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the wind and clouds suddenly gathered above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Endless dark clouds seemed to have appeared out of thin air..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
