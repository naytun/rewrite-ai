When it exploded, it was truly shocking.</p><p>A one-star great emperor of the non-human race rushed over and was killed by Lu Ming with a single slash.</p><p>If he used fifty-five percent of his energy, it would be enough to kill a three star great emperor.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming killed his way through. With Lu Ming’s divine might, the alien races in front of them were finally defeated. They rushed over.</p><p>However, as they were blocked by the front and the foreign races behind them caught up, they lost a large number of people.</p><p>People were dying continuously!</p><p>Now, they had less than 3000 people!</p><p>The number of people in the entire small world was shocking. Naturally, there were far more than three thousand people.</p><p>However, those with low cultivation levels were kept into the small worlds by the true Emperor realm experts.</p><p>However, this was also extremely dangerous. If the true Emperor was killed, everyone in the small world would die as well.</p><p>So, along the way, who knew how many people and how many divine beasts had died.</p><p>The numbers were endless.</p><p>This was the war between the two worlds, and it was extremely cruel!</p><p>When the foreign races attacked the heaven realm, the number of living beings that died in the heaven realm was uncountable.</p><p>Less than 3000 people charged into the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>However, after charging for a while, they encountered another group of foreign races.</p><p>There was no other way. This path had been opened up by the alien races, so there were naturally alien races guarding it. However, it was even more dangerous to go anywhere else. The field energy of the land of dusk could kill everything.</p><p>Everyone fought with all their might, bathing in blood as they charged forward. Yet another few hundred people were left here forever.</p><p>Fortunately, after running into a few waves of alien races, there were no more alien races in front. Lu Ming killed his way to the back and fought with the alien races that were chasing him.</p><p>At the end of the battle, the energy in Celestial Emperor’s corporeal body was completely exhausted and he could no longer control it.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to put away the celestial Thearch’s body. At this moment, he had already killed countless alien races.</p><p>In the end, they only had about two thousand people left.</p><p>This was an extremely heavy loss.</p><p>At this time, they finally arrived at the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>In front of him, there were mountains one after another, rising and falling with each other.</p><p>At this point, the foreign kinds actually stopped and retreated.</p><p>In the eyes of the outsiders, everyone could see fear and terror!</p><p>Lu Ming and the group perked up and did not dare to be careless.</p><p>these mountains look like … They look like huge tombs!</p><p>Someone said, his voice a little dry.</p><p>The others were silent. Indeed, these mountains, one after another, really looked like large tombs. Although there were no tombstones or anything, the shape looked very similar.</p><p>“I don’t think so? These mountains are so majestic, how can they be large tombs?”</p><p>After a while, someone asked in bewilderment.</p><p>“What should we do next?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>the foreign tribes have retreated. Let’s take a rest and recover our strength. One group will rest while the other group will patrol the surroundings!</p><p>An elder of the great emperor realm said.</p><p>Now, there were only three great emperors left among them.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This was the only thing they could do now.</p><p>Just as they were about to make arrangements for their rest, suddenly, a deep rumble came from the front. It came from those mountains.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. They didn’t have time to rest and gathered together, on guard.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A few majestic mountains trembled. Under everyone’s shocked gazes, they actually split open.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A roar came from the crack in the mountain, and a terrifying demonic Qi burst out. It was so terrifying that it made people’s hearts beat faster. It was a great horror.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Roars came from several mountains in a row. The mountains trembled under the roars, and even the earth trembled. The clouds in the sky were scattered, and cracks appeared in the space.</p><p>There seemed to be a few ancient beasts lying dormant in the mountains.</p><p>“This … What is this?”</p><p>Someone’s voice trembled.</p><p>They recalled the news that they had heard before. Some time ago, the Outlanders had entered the depths of the land of dusk in large numbers, but they had returned in defeat in the end. A terrifying creature had awakened in the depths of the land of dusk. The Outlanders, who were also heavenly emperors, had fallen here.</p><p>Was this the kind of creature he was facing now?</p><p>Their faces turned pale. This was truly a dead end. There were alien races behind them, and there were such living beings in front of them.</p><p>However, they did not blame Lu Ming. Even if they did not take this path and rushed to other places in the ten thousand spirit heavenly domain, there was no way for them to go. The alien races would catch up with them. If they encountered the alien race’s celestial Thearch, they would still be doomed.</p><p>Ever since the alien races found the entrance to the small world, their fates seemed to have been sealed, just like all the other creatures in ten thousand spirit heavenly region.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A few terrifying roars sounded from the mountains. Then, a few figures walked out.</p><p>&Nbsp; instantly, a terrifying death energy exploded and covered the world.</p><p>Many of those with weaker cultivations immediately spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“That is … Humans … No, no, zombies … Zombies …”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The figure that walked out of the mountain was not a prehistoric giant beast. It was in the form of an adult and had a tall figure, more than two meters tall.</p><p>However, these figures were covered in long golden hair and had blood-red eyes. The aura of death and fierceness was so thick that it couldn’t be dispersed.</p><p>They were clearly zombies.</p><p>These mountains were indeed huge tombs. Terrifying experts were buried in these huge tombs, and they had turned into zombies after their deaths.</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming and the rest’s minds.</p><p>However, what kind of existence could turn into such a terrifying zombie? even the heavenly Emperor of the foreign race had fallen here.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>There were a total of five zombies. Their blood-red eyes were fixed on Lu Ming and the others. A terrifying, murderous aura filled the air.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>stop! the remaining great emperors rushed forward and unleashed their auras, trying to stop the demonic Qi.</p><p>However, the moment the demonic Qi hit them, their bodies trembled and they retreated. Their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>They couldn’t resist the fierce Qi. The strength of these zombies was terrifying.</p><p>However, although these zombies had amazing strength, they didn’t seem to have any intelligence. With a roar, their fiendish Qi became even stronger and turned into a cold killing intent.</p><p>“Not good, retreat, retreat…”</p><p>A great emperor roared.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The five zombies roared and moved like lightning, rushing towards the crowd at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“I’m finished…”</p><p>Everyone had the same thought.</p><p>These few zombies ‘strength was incomparably shocking. They were not what they could resist at all. They would be easily torn apart.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar came from the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>Then, the five zombies suddenly stopped and floated in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the depths of the land of dusk, behind the towering mountains, at least a dozen figures flew through the air. They were very fast, and in the blink of an eye, they were near them..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
