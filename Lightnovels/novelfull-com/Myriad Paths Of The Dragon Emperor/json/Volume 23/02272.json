Chapter 2271-challenge from another race</p><p>Translator: 549690339</p><p>This battle went on for three days.</p><p>The non-humans paid a heavy price, but they did not manage to break through the two world city. The war drums sounded, and the non-humans began to retreat.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The battleships retreated one by one.</p><p>Outside the two world city, the tear had also closed up.</p><p>Updated on B0XƝ0VEL.COM</p><p>“Clean up the battlefield!”</p><p>Someone ordered.</p><p>The heaven realm Warriors started to pack up. They sorted out the alien race’s corpses and the heaven realm’s creatures that died in battle.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were heavy. In this battle, although more of the foreign races had died, the heaven realm had also paid a heavy price. A large number of experts had died in battle.</p><p>this is the first time in thirty thousand years that the non-humankind has launched such a large-scale attack on the city!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>A few years ago, because of that space passage, the alien races had attacked the city once, but it wasn’t on a large scale.</p><p>After packing up, these resources would all be collected by the upper echelons of two world city in the redemption main hall and used as public resources.</p><p>On the city wall, they were still on guard, in case the foreign races attacked again.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the distance, huge battleships were charging over again.</p><p>The foreign races were attacking the city again.</p><p>A huge battle had broken out once again after half a month.</p><p>This battle was even more brutal than the previous one. Countless experts died in battle. Even the great sovereigns were killed one after another. There were also heavenly emperors who were seriously injured.</p><p>In the end, seeing that they couldn’t take him down, the alien races retreated.</p><p>why are the foreign races launching large-scale attacks in succession? this is the first time in a hundred thousand years!</p><p>Some of them looked very serious.</p><p>Many people were guessing that the alien races had lost their patience and were planning to break into two world city at all costs.</p><p>I’ve heard that more than ten years ago, in another battlefield, the alien races have launched a large-scale attack. In the past few years, there have been constant killing!</p><p>Another person spoke, and the atmosphere became even more oppressive.</p><p>The two world city was not the only battlefield in the Tai Qing heavenly region. There was another one.</p><p>It was also a passageway, but it was not connected to the Hunyuan heavenly region, but to another heavenly region.</p><p>The Tai Qing heavenly region was connected to two other heavenly regions. They all had the same path, and these two passages naturally became battlefields.</p><p>The other battlefield was not weaker than the two world city’s. It was also guarded by a large number of cultivators, and there was constant fighting all year round.</p><p>As for that battlefield, the foreign races had launched a large-scale attack more than ten years ago. Over the years, the fighting had been endless.</p><p>Just like that, another half a month passed by peacefully. Half a month later, the foreign races started their attack again.</p><p>But this time, the alien race stopped tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>“What the hell are they doing?”</p><p>On the side of the heavenly realm, everyone was puzzled.</p><p>At this time, a group of people flew out from the side of the alien race. They flew towards the two world city and stopped 10000 miles away.</p><p>I heard that in the past few years, there have been many geniuses in the heaven realm. Among the younger generation, countless strong people have been born. It just so happens that some geniuses have also been born in our realm. Why don’t we have a friendly match? ”</p><p>A figure stepped out from the alien race’s side, and his voice echoed throughout the entire area.</p><p>This alien was as handsome as a piece of Jade. He had a head of purple hair and was extremely handsome. He looked no different from a human except for the eye in the middle of his forehead.</p><p>This was a King of the non-humankind, a terrifying heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The foreign races were going to send geniuses to challenge them. Many people were moved.</p><p>“How are you guys going to fight?”</p><p>An important figure from the heaven realm spoke. Everyone looked over and saw that it was heavenly venerate six sages.</p><p>“You guys can leave!”</p><p>The non-human King said. Then, five figures walked out from the non-human race.</p><p>They were four young men from the foreign tribe. Although it was hard to recognize them from their appearances, they were indeed from the younger generation and weren’t old.</p><p>“These are the four Young heaven’s favorites from my realm. Your realm can send four heaven’s favorites to fight!”</p><p>The non-human King said.</p><p>“What the hell is this alien doing?”</p><p>it’s simple. The outsiders want to use this move to strike a blow to the morale of the heaven realm. If their elites can crush our elites, many of our elites will be filled with despair and feel that there’s no hope!</p><p>“On the contrary, the outsiders” morale will be greatly boosted!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>Many people came to a sudden realization. That was indeed the case.</p><p>This time, the heaven realm and the primordial realm could be said to have reached their Golden Age, giving birth to countless prodigies.</p><p>Many people saw this group of geniuses as the hope of the heaven realm. They even used a large amount of resources to cultivate them and allowed them to enter and leave all kinds of cultivation Holy Lands.</p><p>He hoped that this batch of heaven’s favorites would grow up and turn the tide of the battle.</p><p>However, what if a heaven’s favorite from the alien race defeated all the heaven’s favorite?</p><p>This proved that even if the heaven realm’s prodigies grew up, they would still be no match for the alien races.</p><p>How despairing was this? It would be strange if their morale wasn’t low.</p><p>However, they had to fight this battle. If they didn’t fight, it would also affect their morale!</p><p>This was the scheme of the outsiders!</p><p>Many people looked at the non-human genius.</p><p>One of them had a burly figure and his entire body was covered in purple scales. When his three eyes opened and closed, they shone with a bright light.</p><p>The last one was less than a meter tall and had four arms.</p><p>The third one was the strangest. He was about the same height as a human and had no scales on his body. However, he was like a shadow, his body constantly twisting. In the middle of his brows, there was a third eye.</p><p>The fourth one made many people’s eyes narrow.</p><p>It was a purple-haired young man who was unbelievably handsome. His three eyes were slightly squinted, and there was a faint smile on his face.</p><p>This was a King of a foreign race.</p><p>“Who will we send?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>the four outsiders must be the top heaven’s favorites. We only have jiujue to fight them!</p><p>“There are some jiujue in two world city, but they seem to be in seclusion!”</p><p>“Send people to look for him!”</p><p>Voices rang out one after another. After that, some heavenly Emperor realm powerhouses entered the various cultivation Holy Lands in two world city to look for jiujue.</p><p>As for the outsiders, they were waiting quietly outside the city walls.</p><p>Not long after, a few figures flew towards the city wall from two world city.</p><p>“I found it!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>There were a total of four young men following behind the heavenly Emperor.</p><p>it just so happens that four of the nine absolutes are in two world city!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor smiled.</p><p>The others also smiled.</p><p>The nine-Jue youth were the nine strongest heaven’s favorites among the heaven realm’s younger generation. They had long reached the true Emperor realm and were all heaven-defying geniuses.</p><p>With jiujue taking action, he would definitely be confident.</p><p>“Are they the ones?”</p><p>A young man from the nine absolutes spoke coldly and arrogantly. He was filled with great confidence.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely recognize him at a glance. Naturally, he was from the Black Tortoise forest. Back then, he was defeated by him and almost withdrew from nine absolutes.</p><p>During this period of time, the Black Tortoise forest had been cultivating in seclusion in two world city, and his combat power had improved greatly.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve been in closed-door cultivation for a long time and want to move my muscles and bones!”</p><p>A bald young man grinned..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
