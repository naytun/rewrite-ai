There was also one beside the Titan bull.</p><p>There was one in the Gu family, and there was one here.</p><p>The one here and the one with the Titan longhorn beetle were both mature.</p><p>This place was a Holy Land for cultivation in two world city. He had the token, so he could enter and cultivate at will.</p><p>B0xùî´ùô§—µùëíùô°.com</p><p>Lu Ming flew forward. The closer he was to the path-understanding ancient tree, the more he could feel the magnificence of the path-understanding ancient tree. Moreover, his body and mind became unusually calm.</p><p>If one cultivated here, the speed of comprehending nomological laws and cultivating divine power techniques would definitely be much faster than anywhere else.</p><p>Many people were cultivating under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>Lu Ming chose an isolated place, sat cross-legged, and started to comprehend quietly.</p><p>Time flew by, and ten days passed in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming was already at the beginner level of the cultivation of the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>The life law, array law, and weapon law intertwined together to form a unique divine power Technique. Once it was activated, his life force would reach an astonishing level.</p><p>Not only for the body, but also for the soul. The recovery speed was several times faster than the life law.</p><p>One had to know that this was only three types of nomological laws. If it was cultivated to large success, the magical power formed by 18 types of nomological laws would be astonishing and almost indestructible.</p><p>Of course, the undying ancient scroll‚Äôs profoundness was not limited to this.</p><p>Not only did he have the ability to recover, but he also had the ability to attack.</p><p>Inside, there was another divine power called the inextinguishable golden body.</p><p>By cultivating this divine ability, one‚Äôs entire body would seem to have turned into a peerless divine weapon. Its defensive power was astonishing, and it was immortal. Furthermore, it also possessed terrifying offensive power.</p><p>Every part of his body was like a divine weapon that could explode with shocking power.</p><p>This was the indestructible ancient scroll. It could attack and defend, and its recovery ability was astonishing.</p><p>It was no wonder that even the celestial Thearch was envious and wanted to obtain it.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started to comprehend.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had cultivated under the path-understanding ancient tree for a month.</p><p>The speed at which one cultivated divine abilities here was indeed astonishing.</p><p>In a short month, Lu Ming had already cultivated the indestructible ancient scroll to a certain level.</p><p>Of course, if he wanted to increase its power, he would have to comprehend the other nomological laws in the indestructible ancient scroll. The more nomological laws he mastered, the stronger the power would be.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no intention of comprehending other laws now.</p><p>He had already mastered nine types of laws and would need to spend a lot of energy to comprehend them. He should not bite off more than he could chew. Lu Ming planned to put his energy into the nine types of laws he had now.</p><p>‚ÄúNow, it‚Äôs time to refine the chaos Qi!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the place. He returned to his residence and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Then, a chaos gem appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the power of the world. With a single breath, three streams of air were sucked out of the chaos gem.</p><p>They were three wisps of chaos Qi.</p><p>A chaos gem usually contained three wisps of chaos Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and the three chaos gems were sucked into his mouth. They surged into the small world and Lu Ming began to refine.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The small world trembled slightly and became more stable. At the same time, its surface area grew larger.</p><p>After refining the three wisps of chaotic Qi, he took out a chaos gem and sucked out the three wisps of chaotic Qi from it before continuing the refinement.</p><p>Just like that, a month later, he refined all three chaos gems and a total of nine strands of chaos Qi.</p><p>A total of nine wisps of chaos Qi caused his cultivation to skyrocket.</p><p>His cultivation had just broken through to the four-star void Emperor realm. Now, he had broken through to the five-star void Emperor realm and even reached the peak of the five-star void Emperor realm.</p><p>This speed was shocking.</p><p>One had to know that the higher one‚Äôs cultivation was, the harder it was to raise it, and the more energy it would require.</p><p>From this, one could see how precious the nine wisps of chaos Qi were.</p><p>if I had an endless supply of chaos gems, wouldn‚Äôt my cultivation level be continuously improved?‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs eyes lit up but he shook his head soon after.</p><p>This was impossible. The reason he could improve so quickly was that he already had nine types of nomological laws, all of which had reached the perfection of the first realm. The nomological threads covered the entire small world, making it very stable. Only then could he continuously refine energy to improve himself.</p><p>If it were anyone else who had not cultivated their nomological laws to the right level, such a crazy increase would probably cause the small world to explode.</p><p>‚ÄúMy chaos laws!‚Äù</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming‚Äôs eyes lit up.</p><p>he could sense that the Laws of Chaos were about to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately closed his eyes and seized this fleeting inspiration.</p><p>A day later, a dusky law rose from Lu Ming‚Äôs body. It was the law of chaos. However, the power of the law of chaos that he was controlling now was much stronger than before.</p><p>The second realm!</p><p>Lu Ming‚Äôs chaos laws were the first to break through to the second realm.</p><p>When Lu Ming was going through the heavenly Tribulation, he had experienced a series of battles. His understanding of the various laws had improved. Now, because he had refined the chaos Qi and the chaos Qi and the chaos laws were connected, Lu Ming finally grasped a trace of inspiration and successfully made a breakthrough.</p><p>The breakthrough in the chaos laws had undoubtedly made Lu Ming stronger.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know how strong I am now!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered secretly.</p><p>If he were to face one of the nine absolutes, the Black Tortoise forest, he would be able to defeat it easily.</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the path-understanding ancient tree!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ming was excited. He wanted to go to the path-understanding ancient tree and see if he could break through a few more laws in one go.</p><p>He then went to the Dao Comprehension ancient tree to comprehend the laws.</p><p>A month later, Lu Ming was disappointed.</p><p>His other eight laws had all reached a bottleneck.</p><p>When one encountered a bottleneck, it was not something that could be broken through simply by bitter cultivation and comprehension.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was not very useful in this regard.</p><p>The path-understanding ancient tree was very useful for people like him who had just broken through the bottleneck of the chaotic laws. It could help Lu Ming to deepen his understanding and improve his level of mastery.</p><p>it seems like it‚Äôs time to go to the battlefield to train!</p><p>The best way to break through the bottleneck was to engage in a life-and-death battle. Only in a life-and-death battle could one stimulate one‚Äôs potential and improve quickly.</p><p>When Lu Ming was going through the Tribulation, he had to face a life-and-death battle. At the end, he fell into a life-and-death state and comprehended how to merge the laws of life, chaos, and death.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place. First, he bought a piece of information that introduced the battlefield and read it in detail.</p><p>The battlefield between the Hunyuan heavenly region and the taiqing heavenly region was huge and vast.</p><p>Apart from some ordinary battlefields, there were also some special battlefields.</p><p>For example, when Lu Ming first came, the ancient battlefield was very strange. No one dared to enter it in the past.</p><p>In addition, the heaven realm and the alien races had divided several special battlefields for the powerhouses of both sides to fight.</p><p>They were the empty Emperor battlefield, the true Emperor battlefield, and the great emperor battlefield.</p><p>These battlefields corresponded to people of different cultivation bases..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
