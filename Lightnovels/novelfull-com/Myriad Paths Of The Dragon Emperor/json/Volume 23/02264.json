Whoosh!</p><p>The evil god race’s third eye shone with a brilliant light, and six beams of destructive light shot out toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming slashed out with his sword and immediately dispersed the six beams of destructive light.

They were easily cut and killed.</p><p>They finally understood that a terrifying expert had arrived.</p><p>Otherwise, a five-star void Emperor would not have dared to rush over upon seeing so many experts.</p><p>As for rhe living beings of the heaven realm, they were ecstatic.</p><p>they were already in danger and could have been wiped out by the evil god race and died here.</p><p>This kind of example would often happen on this battlefield.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s appearance gave them hope.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After killing the six experts of the evil god tribe, Lu Ming did not stop. He flapped his six-feathered divine wings and charged toward the evil god tribe.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a tiger that had entered a flock of sheep. He destroyed everything like rotten wood. With every slash of his sword, at least one evil god tribe member was killed.</p><p>Regardless of whether they were six-star or seven-star illusionary emperors, as long as they were illusionary emperors, they were all the same in front of Lu Ming.

However, most of them were still killed by Lu Ming. Only a few managed to escape.</p><p>However, their speed was much slower than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the six-feathered divine wings, and his figure flickered non-stop. He caught up with the evil god tribe members who had escaped and killed them one by one.</p><p>They then returned and charged towards the evil god race that were being held back by the heaven realm beings.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>Not long after, the entire evil god race was killed, and not a single one was left.</p><p>More than fifty members of the evil god tribe, all of whom were six-star illusionary thearchs and above, had fallen here.</p><p>The living beings of the heaven realm felt like they were in a dream.</p><p>In the beginning, they were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties.

Instead, he planned to train in the outer area.</p><p>The battlefield was very quiet, and not a single figure could be seen.</p><p>On the battlefield, ordinary people didn’t dare to fly, because that would be too big of a target. It was an act of courting death, unless it was a terrifying existence.</p><p>Lu Ming ran carefully. At the same time, he spread out his spiritual sense and kept an eye on his surroundings.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the rock beneath Lu Ming’s feet cracked open and a huge claw swiped at him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
