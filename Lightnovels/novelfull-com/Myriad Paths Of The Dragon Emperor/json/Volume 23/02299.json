They were all middle-aged men with burly bodies and strong auras.</p><p>Their bodies were filled with powerful life essence. They weren’t zombies, but real humans.</p><p>They didn’t expect that there would be humans in the depths of the land of dusk, and it seemed that those powerful zombies would listen to their orders.</p><p>If he was a human, they would be saved.</p><p>More than a dozen burly men came forward and first bowed to those zombies, which made people surprised.</p><p>Then, the dozen of them looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a strong sense of hostility in their eyes.</p><p>“You guys are from the law system? Were you the ones who disturbed our ancestor’s slumber?”</p><p>The leader of the group, a burly man, spoke with a cold voice.</p><p>“Law system? The ancestor is in a deep sleep?”</p><p>He was very surprised to see Lu Ming, Ren Chan, and the others.</p><p>What did this burly man mean?</p><p>Why did he say that they were a system of laws? This statement was very strange. Could it be that the other party did not cultivate the nomological system?</p><p>And the ancestor’s slumber, could it be referring to those zombies?</p><p>senior, we weren’t the ones who disturbed your ancestors ‘slumber a while ago. It was the outsiders!</p><p>Ren Chan said.</p><p>“A foreign race? What alien race?”</p><p>The leading middle-aged man was puzzled.</p><p>in my opinion, it’s them. There are no good people in the law system. Capture them all first and hand them over to the elders for interrogation to see what conspiracy they have!</p><p>Another big man shouted.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The other burly men nodded one after another. This made Lu Ming and the others ‘expressions change.</p><p>The burly man in the lead nodded. At once, more than ten burly men moved as fast as lightning and appeared around Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>BOOM! boom!</p><p>A shocking aura burst out from the bodies of the dozen burly men, and there was a thunderous explosion. Pillars of blood Qi rushed out of their bodies and soared into the sky like smoke.</p><p>It was pure blood Qi. The dozen burly men were like ten ancient barbaric Dragons. Their blood Qi was extremely dense, forming a terrifying pressure! body cultivators, ancient body cultivators, they are ancient body cultivators!</p><p>A great emperor exclaimed.</p><p>The others were also greatly shocked.</p><p>Ancient body cultivators, these people were actually ancient body cultivators!</p><p>No wonder these people called them the system of laws. The immemorial cultivation system and the system of laws were indeed two completely different cultivation systems.</p><p>However, the immemorial body cultivators had long been lost. Only a small number of them were still passed down, and the number of people who cultivated them was also very small.</p><p>There were actually more than ten Archean body cultivators here.</p><p>senior, you’ve misunderstood. This is the first time we’ve come here. We were also being hunted down, so we fled here. The ones who disturbed you are indeed from the foreign tribes!</p><p>An Emperor explained.</p><p>The auras of these dozen or so burly men were too astonishing. Their qi and blood were incomparably rich, like Savage Dragons. Their muscles trembled slightly, and they actually emitted a terrifying rumbling sound.</p><p>It was caused by the rapid vibration of his muscles and the bombarding of air.</p><p>This was a pure ancient body cultivator.</p><p>It was said that the immemorial body cultivators cultivated their physical bodies. Their qi and blood were like dragons, and their physical bodies were unbelievably strong.</p><p>They didn’t have Saint power or world power in their bodies, but they could still fly and even break the void.</p><p>What he relied on was his physical body.</p><p>Their muscles vibrated and resonated with the space, allowing them to fly.</p><p>They had already used their bodies to the extreme.</p><p>This was the case for the dozen burly men in front of him.</p><p>whether it’s a misunderstanding or not, you can explain it to our elders. Let’s go, don’t force us to fight!</p><p>you’re courting death! the burly man in the lead said coldly. A terrifying aura enveloped the heavens and earth. His figure was clearly no different from an ordinary person, but he made people feel as if they were facing a giant wild beast.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The five zombies also roared, and their terrifying aura enveloped Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>These five zombies were extremely powerful. With the addition of the dozen burly men, they simply couldn’t resist them. If they attacked, only death would await them.</p><p>no matter what, they are all human beings. It’s better than falling into the hands of the alien races!</p><p>“That’s right, then we’ll go with them!”</p><p>A few people transmitted their voices. In the end, the few great emperors nodded and decided to follow the other party.</p><p>“Follow us!”</p><p>The burly man in the lead led the way into the depths of the land of dusk.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed him. The other burly men fell behind and blocked their way out.</p><p>They flew toward the tomb-like mountains, and when the five zombies arrived, they entered the cracks in the mountains, and the mountains closed one by one.</p><p>“Could it be that these zombies were all experts who cultivated ancient body cultivators when they were alive?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Ancient body cultivators had extremely strong bodies, and it was difficult for their bodies to decay even after death. These zombies were so powerful, so they were most likely formed after the ancient body cultivators died.</p><p>Experts who cultivated the nomological system did not have such powerful bodies. Even if they turned into zombies after death, they would not be so powerful.</p><p>Moreover, these zombies didn’t seem to have any intelligence, but they listened to the orders of the burly men. The burly men called these zombies ancestors, which explained the problem even more.</p><p>The group of people kept going inside. After crossing those mountains, what appeared in front of them was still the mountains.</p><p>there are so many mountains. It can’t be that every mountain has a powerful zombie, right?”</p><p>Someone said in a low voice, full of shock.</p><p>If that was the case, it would be terrifying. No wonder the foreign races would suffer a great loss here.</p><p>They had flown over at least a hundred mountains. In front of them, there was a Col surrounded by a few mountains. In the Col, there was a huge stone gate.</p><p>The stone door was open, and there was a pitch-black Vortex inside.</p><p>“This is the entrance to a small world!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the group had an idea.</p><p>The burly man in the lead entered the stone door first, followed by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>After stepping through the stone door, they arrived at a huge square in the next moment. There were already many people around the square. They were all middle-aged men with strong qi and blood. One look and one could tell that they were all from the immemorial system.</p><p>The land of ten thousand spirits ‘number one forbidden area, the depths of the land of dusk, actually had a small world with a large number of Archean body cultivators. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“Come with me!”</p><p>The burly man who was the leader of the group stood in front of them. After he finished speaking, he led them and flew forward.</p><p>this space … No, could it be a small world that was born naturally? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and was even more surprised.</p><p>There were many small worlds in this world and most of them were man-made. Once one’s cultivation reached the true Emperor realm, they would be able to cultivate a relatively stable small world.</p><p>However, there were also very few small worlds that were not man-made, but were born naturally.</p><p>For example, when the heaven realm was born, there would also be some small worlds born and attached to the heaven realm.</p><p>However, such small worlds were extremely rare.</p><p>The one where the immemorial body cultivators lived was naturally born..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
