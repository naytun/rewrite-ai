They stopped not far away from the outsiders.</p><p>“You’re finally here. I thought you didn’t dare to fight!”</p><p>One of the foreign beings said.</p><p>in the contest of the younger generation, the heaven realm is not afraid of anyone!</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages said coldly.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, let’s begin. You can choose any of the four prodigies of our realm!”</p><p>The alien imperial clan heavenly Emperor said.</p><p>At this moment, the four from the Black Tortoise forest were also sizing up the four foreign Young heaven’s favorites.</p><p>When they saw the young man from the royal family, their eyes turned serious.</p><p>Everyone knew that the Royal non-human races were extremely rare, but each one of them had terrifying battle power and endless potential.</p><p>They didn’t care about the other non-human heaven’s favorites, but they had to take the Royal non-human race seriously.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest spoke first and stepped forward. His gaze scanned the four non-human heaven’s favorites before finally landing on the burly non-human.</p><p>The burly alien race was the most widespread and numerous race among the alien races. The people in the heaven realm knew this race the best.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest would naturally choose the one they were most confident in.</p><p>“You, fight me!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise pointed at the burly alien.</p><p>“You’re choosing me?”</p><p>The three eyes of the burly alien opened and closed, emitting a cold killing intent.</p><p>He felt that he had been underestimated when he was the first one to be chosen.</p><p>kid, it’s your bad luck that you chose me first. Remember, the one who defeated you is called Wei Mo!</p><p>A burly alien stepped out, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>True Emperor!</p><p>Without a doubt, the foreign youth Wei Mo had already stepped into the true Emperor realm.</p><p>“There are strong and weak true emperors too. Kill!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest moved. He pushed out with both hands, and two stars appeared, blasting toward Wei Mo.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>destroy! Vimo dandan said, and two beams of destructive light shot out of his third eye.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest’s two stars were easily destroyed by the other party.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s expression darkened slightly. He quickly formed a seal with his hands, and stars appeared around him one after another. There was a total of 360 stars.</p><p>“Heavenly cycle stellar fist!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest didn’t hold back at all. He directly used his strongest killing move and raised his combat strength to the extreme.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>One star after another streaked through the air, shooting toward Wei Mo with a long tail.</p><p>the Black Tortoise forest’s combat strength has increased a lot!</p><p>that’s right. A few years ago, when he fought with Lu Ming in yaoguang ancient city, he was only equivalent to a third stage true Emperor. Now, he’s already a fifth stage true Emperor. His improvement is shocking. He’s indeed a peerless genius!</p><p>Many people from the heavenly realm were overjoyed.</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest must have suffered a great loss in the battle with Lu Ming. In the past few years, they had worked hard and improved tremendously.</p><p>They believed that this battle was in the bag!</p><p>But in the next moment, everyone from the heaven realm’s expression changed.</p><p>Wei Mo let out a long hiss, and his body was covered with a crystal-like purple light. A battle axe appeared in his hand, and his burly body rushed toward the Black Tortoise forest like a wild beast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, Wei Mo held the battle-ax with both hands and continuously slashed at the stars.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Those stars were like bubbles as they were easily split apart by Wei Mo.</p><p>Wei Mo strode forward, his battleaxe continuously slashing out. One star after another was formed, but they were all broken.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s expression changed. With a loud roar, he pushed his palms forward.</p><p>In an instant, two hundred stars shot towards Wei Mo.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wei Mo shouted coldly, and in an instant, he chopped out a few hundred times, filling the sky with axe shadows.</p><p>The stars exploded one after another.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the end, Wei Mo let out a loud roar and slashed out a shocking axe radiance.</p><p>A huge battle-ax with an energy of 10000 meters stood between the heaven and earth and suddenly slashed toward the Black Tortoise forest.</p><p>Xuanwu Lin’s pupils contracted sharply, and he exploded with all his strength. He fused all the stars into one, turning it into a huge star that blasted toward his opponent.</p><p>However, as the giant axe came down, the star exploded like a sun exploding in the sky. Black Tortoise Lin let out a blood-curdling scream as his body was sent flying. He flew for more than 10000 meters and fell to the ground, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest had lost!</p><p>The heaven realm experts ‘faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>The powerful black Tortoise forest, which was one of the nine absolutes, was defeated without causing much trouble to the other party.</p><p>“This Wei Mo’s battle power is at least at the sixth stage true Emperor level!”</p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Did the foreign races also have such terrifying geniuses?</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>The heaven realm and the primordial realm had only produced a large number of prodigies when they reached their Golden Age. However, how could the foreign races also have such powerful prodigies?</p><p>it must be someone else. It’s impossible for the Outlanders to have many of such heaven’s favorites. Impossible!</p><p>Someone growled, finding it hard to accept.</p><p>“Is this the heaven realm’s top genius? Can’t even withstand a single blow!”</p><p>Wei Mo spoke coldly and looked at the Black Tortoise forest with disdain. He carried his battle-axe and walked back.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the other heavenly emperors all had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>The loss of the Black Tortoise forest would more or less affect the morale of the heaven realm.</p><p>“You must win the second round!”</p><p>The six Saint venerable transmitted his voice to the remaining three heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“I’ll do this round!”</p><p>The bald young man stepped forward.</p><p>This person’s combat strength was very strong. Back in the Alkaid ancient city, he had also made a move to deal with Lu Ming. Later, he was stopped by dandan and displayed shocking combat strength. He was much stronger than the Xuanwu forest at that time.</p><p>The bald young man’s gaze swept across the remaining three, and finally fell on the four-armed skinny foreign man.</p><p>“You, come out and fight me!”</p><p>The bald youth said.</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Smiling faintly, he took a step forward and appeared in front of the bald youth with astonishing speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the skinny young man made his move. In a flash, his skinny body disappeared. The next moment, four extremely sharp blades appeared around the bald young man and slashed at him.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>The speed of this skinny foreign being was simply too astonishing. His body was so fast that it was impossible to catch him.</p><p>“Crazy devil fist technique!”</p><p>The bald young man roared and punched out with both fists like a mad demon.</p><p>The terrifying fist force swept in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of metal vibrating reverberated in all directions.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged over a hundred moves, their speed fast to the extreme..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
