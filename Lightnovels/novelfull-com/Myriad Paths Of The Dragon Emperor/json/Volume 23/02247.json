There were shocked discussions, shouts, and exclamations.</p><p>Even the heavenly Emperor characters found it hard to remain calm and were extremely shocked.</p><p>Oh my God, an Emperor-to-be can not only control many laws, but also two ultimate laws. Now, he has mastered three ultimate laws!</p><p>three ultimate maxims. How did he do that?”</p><p>the Laws of Chaos and the laws of death are the main offensive force, while the laws of life can heal the body. This is simply a perfect combination!</p><p>if he can become a saint Emperor, no one at the same level as him can be his match. Even the most amazing genius in history can’t be his match!</p><p>Many people shouted. They were truly shocked beyond belief.</p><p>It was already shocking enough that a person could control two ultimate maxims. Now, he could actually control three ultimate maxims.</p><p>Chaos, death, and life!</p><p>It was a perfect match.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, and Yuan Xin all shook their heads crazily, their eyes full of disbelief.</p><p>They found it hard to believe that all of this was real and hard to accept.</p><p>it doesn’t matter how many laws he can control. He can’t become a saint Emperor, so his combat power is limited. I’ll definitely be able to suppress him in the future!</p><p>They roared in their hearts. This was the only reason they could use to comfort themselves. Otherwise, their hearts of martial arts would be unstable.</p><p>Mingsheng’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on Mingsheng, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries had fully healed, and his fighting spirit was at its peak. At the same time, a large pile of origin stones appeared beside him. Lu Ming cast the law of devouring, and the large pile of origin stones turned into origin Qi and entered his body. The Saint energy that Lu Ming had just consumed was quickly restored.</p><p>“What a pervert!”</p><p>Many people sighed. Lu Ming’s combination of laws was simply invincible. He was like a war machine.</p><p>Mingsheng was a little dejected. He shook his head and retreated.</p><p>He was already severely injured and could not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>“Lan Cheng, what do you say now? Lu Ming’s ability is obvious to all!”</p><p>The heavenly Emperor Heng Yu turned to look at the LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Hmph, no matter how many laws you control and how strong your battle prowess is, what’s the use if you can’t become a divine Emperor? There’s a limit to his strength, and any true Emperor would be able to suppress him!”</p><p>Lan Cheng coldly snorted, his voice still filled with disdain.</p><p>He wanted to grasp this point and not let go.</p><p>if he can’t become a saint Emperor, everything else is useless. Therefore, it’s still a waste to leave the indestructible ancient scroll on him. I need to strip it out and give it to stronger geniuses!</p><p>Lan Cheng continued.</p><p>“Haha, what stronger heaven’s favorite? These people can’t even withstand a single blow. I’m invincible in a battle of the same level!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed arrogantly. He was filled with confidence.Tm invincible.’</p><p>Even in front of the celestial Emperor, it was the same!</p><p>Many people were shocked. They looked at the young man in front of them and sighed.</p><p>This young man was extraordinary. Be it in terms of wisdom, perseverance, talent, or heart of martial arts, he was at the top. However, fate made a fool of him and he could not become a sovereign.</p><p>Once he became an Emperor, he would probably shock the world.</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming continued to speak. His eyes were like stars as he stared at the LAN family’s celestial Thearch and said,”You’ve said time and time again that 1 can’t become a saint Emperor. What makes you think that 1 can’t?” Why do you think I can’t become a saint Emperor?</p><p>Many people were stunned by his words.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming still thought that he could become an Emperor?</p><p>However, in the history of the heaven realm, it was not as if no one under the rank of a martial sovereign had mastered multiple nomological laws, but none of them had become a sovereign? No one was an exception.</p><p>After that, many peerless powerhouses studied it and came to the conclusion that if one could master many laws below the martial sovereign realm, the path of martial Dao would be broken and one could never become a sovereign.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lan Cheng himself was also stunned at first. Then, he laughed out loud, full of ridicule, and said, those below the martial Supreme realm can control many laws, but they can’t become a Supreme Emperor. This has been a truth since ancient times and no one has been able to break it. You’re still dreaming of becoming a Supreme Emperor. What a joke!</p><p>“Who’s the laughable one?”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately retorted, his eyes shining, during the primordial era, the heaven realm was filled with the primordial cultivation system. At that time, did anyone think that a nomological cultivation system would appear? later on, it was still created by someone. It was unprecedented, and it led straight to the great Dao!</p><p>just because the ancients couldn’t do it doesn’t mean that the later generations can’t do it. It doesn’t mean that no one can do it. You don’t even understand this logic. What a waste of being the celestial Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area. It was filled with boundless pride and unyielding spirit, unyielding to fate.</p><p>Many people were touched. Indeed, if the ancient people couldn’t do it, would the future generations be unable to do it?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lan Cheng was at a loss for words. At the same time, an ice-cold killing intent filled his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to talk back to him and embarrass him. If they were not in public, he would have killed Lu Ming with one slap.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming, a junior, speak to the celestial Thearch in such a manner? this is a great disrespect and you deserve to be punished!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice rang out, and a young man stepped out.</p><p>This young man was wearing a black iron battle suit, and his entire body was filled with a sharp aura.</p><p>“It’s him, ou yabing!”</p><p>“The strongest illusionary divine among the younger generation of the heaven realm, ou yabing, is about to make his move!”</p><p>Someone immediately recognized the young man.</p><p>“Disrespectful? What a joke, some people also need to have something worthy of respect. Those who are not worthy of respect, why should they be respected? of course, there are exceptions to those who are deliberately flattering!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his words crossing the line.</p><p>First of all, they said that LAN city was not worthy of respect. Furthermore, they also said that ou Yibing was just trying to curry favor with them.</p><p>“Impudent! I’ll teach you how to behave!”</p><p>Ouyang Bing was furious, and a terrifying aura burst out from his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Ou yabing made his move immediately. He took a step forward and continued to close the distance between him and Lu Ming. At the same time, his palm glowed. With a wave of his hand, a small black Pagoda appeared. It grew rapidly and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed!</p><p>This Pagoda was not a monarch weapon, nor was it corporeal. It was a Divine Art that was condensed from laws and the power of the world.</p><p>The hammer of chaos condensed in Lu Ming’s hands and he swung it.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A dull explosion was heard. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was forced to retreat. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were a little solemn.</p><p>A shocking power came from the other party’s Black Tower. It far exceeded Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“A seven-star illusionary Emperor. Also, at least four of his nomological laws have reached the second realm!”</p><p>After matching one move, Lu Ming could only roughly estimate the other party’s strength.</p><p>“Just this bit of strength? Let’s see how many moves you can take!”</p><p>let’s go,” ou yabing said indifferently. With a wave of his hand, the giant Pagoda came crashing down on Lu Ming again.</p><p>At this moment, the hammer of chaos in Lu Ming’s hand disappeared and was replaced by a long spear.</p><p>It was a spear that contained eight laws.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his spear out. The long spear expanded rapidly and bombarded the giant tower..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
