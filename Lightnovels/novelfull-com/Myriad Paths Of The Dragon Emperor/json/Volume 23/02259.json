I didn’t do anything!”</p><p>you’ve just made a breakthrough in your cultivation,” heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said with a smile, you should go back and consolidate your cultivation and build a solid foundation. If you have anything to say, we can talk about it in the future!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and immediately returned to his residence with dandan, bubbles, Mu Lan and the Gu family.</p><p>As soon as he returned to his residence, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and constantly circulated the world Energy to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>This time, after breaking through to the void Emperor realm, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had skyrocketed all the way to the four-star void Emperor realm. He indeed needed to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. His cultivation had completely stabilized.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and stretched his muscles in the courtyard.</p><p>Suddenly, the space moved and a figure appeared in the courtyard.</p><p>“Senior Heng Yu!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed. The person who had come was the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>I sensed that you had finished your cultivation, so 1 rushed over. Your cultivation should have stabilized by now, right?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu smiled.</p><p>“It’s stabilized!”</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, I’ve brought your stone body. I’ll give it to you now!” Lu Ming nodded and continued.</p><p>A stone golem appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It looked exactly like the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor looked at the stone being with a complicated expression before smiling. I’ve already removed this stone body and condensed a new physical body. This stone body is now equivalent to a puppet. It’s of no use to me. You can keep it and keep it!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Seeing that the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor’s attitude was firm, he did not say much and put away the heavenly Emperor’s body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s your plan next?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu asked.</p><p>“What’s your next plan? 1 want to find a place to train, raise my cultivation, and comprehend the laws!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Since he had come to the heaven realm, he didn’t plan to go back for the time being. He had just become a great emperor and it was the time for him to advance by leaps and bounds. He planned to stay in the heaven realm to cultivate first.</p><p>if that’s the case, 1 recommend you to go to the two world city and fight with the alien races. That way, you’ll improve the fastest!</p><p>also, there are many cultivation places in two world city. With your current talent, you can freely enter and exit those cultivation places. Furthermore, the higher-ups of the heaven realm will give you some appropriate rewards, just like the other top heaven’s favorites!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Alright, I was also thinking of going to two world city!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. If he wanted to improve his cultivation as quickly as possible, the best place would be a life-and-death battle. The battlefield outside two world city was the best place.</p><p>Lu Ming also had the intention to go to two world city.</p><p>alright, I’ll also be participating in the battle in two world city. If you want to go, come with us!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“Senior Hengyu, when are you leaving? I’m going to say goodbye to my friends!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We’ll set off tomorrow!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor said. He then chatted with Lu Ming for a while and set a time to set off before leaving.</p><p>Lu Ming headed to another courtyard. Before he entered the courtyard, he heard dandan and bubbles’s shouts. He walked in and saw the two of them sparring.</p><p>With the appearance of a senior expert, he guided bubbles in her cultivation.</p><p>“Little guy, you can’t do it. You’ve overused the space-time laws and haven’t displayed their power at all. You’re far from your mother!”</p><p>yes, when your mother sees me, she has to call me big brother. For this reason, I’ll give you some pointers!</p><p>“Stand still!”</p><p>Dandan bragged as she guided bubbles in her cultivation.</p><p>This fellow’s experience and vision were indeed unique. He easily saw through bubbles ‘weaknesses and gave her pointers.</p><p>Lu Ming walked in.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles immediately abandoned dandan and rushed to Lu Ming’s shoulder, hanging onto him.</p><p>nest, you ran so fast. Who taught you just now? you’re so ungrateful!</p><p>Dandan was very unhappy and looked at Lu Ming from the corner of her eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored dandan.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, bubbles is leaving. My master sent me a message and asked me to go back and cultivate!</p><p>Before Lu Ming could speak, Pao Pao spoke first.</p><p>Lu Ming already knew that bubbles had a master in the heaven realm. It was said that he was an unparalleled expert who knew bubbles ‘mother back then. He was an antique who had survived from ancient times.</p><p>moreover, he was extremely skilled in spacetime laws.</p><p>yes, I’m about to leave for two world city to cultivate. If you have time in the future, you can come and find me there!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“But, paoba can’t bear to!”</p><p>The bubble hung on Lu Ming’s body and rubbed against him, reluctant to come down.</p><p>Lu Ming persuaded her nicely and eventually, bubbles agreed to go back to cultivate.</p><p>little brat, I’m going to leave too. The heaven realm is vast, with all kinds of forbidden places and countless opportunities. I’m going to find opportunities and improve my cultivation quickly, or I’ll be surpassed by you!</p><p>Dandan also walked over and said.</p><p>“Haha, the next time we meet, I’ll definitely surpass you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took out a few jars of fine wine. He passed them to dandan and bubbles and the three of them started drinking.</p><p>Everyone had their own path to walk. Only by walking the path that suited them the most could they grow quickly.</p><p>They all felt a sense of urgency.</p><p>Now, although the Tai Qing heavenly region was still in the heaven realm, the alien races had not given up on attacking. They had been looking for all kinds of ways to deal with it. No one knew when a terrifying war would break out.</p><p>Even though they were all Saint emperors now and their combat powers were not weak, they were not enough for The War of the Two Worlds. They had to keep improving.</p><p>The three of them drank and chatted. Later, Mu Lan joined in. Lu Ming took out a true Emperor golden Crow from his storage ring and started to roast it.</p><p>Everyone drank from day to night, and from night to day.</p><p>At dawn, bubbles and dandan bade farewell and left.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming and Mu Lan walked toward the residence of the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Not long after, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor and a few other heavenly emperors from the primordial realm set off for two world city.</p><p>The celestial Thearch’s speed was simply too fast. Not long after, they arrived at two world city once again.</p><p>miss Mu Lan, with your talent, you’re also free to enter some of the cultivation sites in two world city to cultivate!</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor gave Mu Lan a token.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Mu Lan expressed her thanks to the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>you’re welcome. I also hope to see you grow, especially since we’re all from the primordial realm!</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor smiled and said to Lu Ming,”Lu Ming, the celestial venerable wants to see you. Come with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor. Soon, they arrived at a side hall.</p><p>There, Lu Ming met the white-haired celestial venerable.</p><p>“Junior greets heavenly venerate six sages!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted the white-haired celestial venerable.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages was the white-haired heavenly venerate’s title..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
