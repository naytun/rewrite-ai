This blood Bladesman is actually good at the nomological laws of death, array Dao laws, and devouring laws!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were shining.</p><p>Blood Bladesman was definitely a very suitable target for training. Among the laws that he controlled, there were three that were the same as Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Although the battle with the bloody swordsman was short, he had a strong impression of Lu Ming.</p><p>In particular, the other party had three types of laws that were the same as Lu Ming’s. After fighting with the other party, Lu Ming’s understanding of the three types of laws became faster.</p><p>Lu Ming would not let blood swordsman off just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming was there, comprehending the laws and digesting what he had gained from the battle.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>“Let’s continue the battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and rushed straight to the cave where the bloody swordsman lived.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>From a distance, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he thrust it forward.</p><p>A huge spear light as big as a mountain stabbed toward the cave.</p><p>The cave exploded.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>With a furious roar, the bloody blade hand soared into the sky. Endless blood light burst forth, shattering the mountain rocks.</p><p>Then, he saw Lu Ming!</p><p>brat, I didn’t go to find you, but you actually dared to come to me. You’re simply looking for death. Kill!</p><p>The bloody swordsman roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few moves in a row. Just like the previous time, Lu Ming was still no match for him. He was completely suppressed and severely injured.</p><p>the third level of the law of death. So that’s how it is. So that’s how it is. Hahaha!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart. During the battle with the bloody swordsman, Lu Ming had caught a trace of inspiration from the other party’s death law.</p><p>He felt that there was hope for a breakthrough.</p><p>Blood Blade wielder, let’s not fight today. We’ll fight another day!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and flew into the distance with his six-feathered wings.</p><p>Bloody blade hand roared as he pursued madly. However, after chasing for a while, he could only stop helplessly.</p><p>this brat’s life-saving energy is too strong, and his speed is also fast. Unless he’s heavily injured to the point where he can’t fight back, it’s very difficult to kill him!</p><p>Bloody blade artist gritted his teeth and left in a flash.</p><p>This time, the bloody swordsman kept changing his position, afraid that Lu Ming would secretly follow him.</p><p>He had guessed correctly. Lu Ming had indeed followed them and the bloody swordsman had not noticed him at all.</p><p>The bloody swordsman was very familiar with the core area of the true Emperor battlefield. After running for a distance, he looked around but did not see Lu Ming. He then hid in a hidden place.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating not far away.</p><p>He had left a part of his mind to observe Blood Blade hand’s movements, while most of his mind was used to comprehend the laws.</p><p>His understanding of the law of death continued to deepen.</p><p>Finally, after a few days, the death precept broke through and broke through the limit, entering the third realm of the precept in one fell swoop.</p><p>This was the peak of the laws, the limit of the laws.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had skyrocketed after the breakthrough in the death rule.</p><p>This was an ultimate Maxim, and the increase in combat strength was especially shocking. Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached the peak of a rank 12 true Emperor in one fell swoop, increasing his combat strength by a whole rank.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Just as he was about to continue his battle with bloody blade hand, he saw a figure appear. It was bloody blade hand.</p><p>Bloody blade artist looked around for a moment before he turned and left in a direction.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly followed them.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw the bloody swordsman lying in ambush on a mountain peak. Then, he saw a figure flying over from the distance.</p><p>It was a living being from the heaven realm.</p><p>This guy wanted to kill the creatures of the heaven realm again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bloody blade hand made his move. A blade light burst out, slashing towards the creature.</p><p>The heaven realm being was shocked. It transformed into a fierce tiger and let out a long roar, shooting out a beam of light from its mouth.</p><p>However, this Tiger only had the battle strength of a level 12 true Emperor. It was no match for the blood Blade artist. The light pillar was cut open and the blade Qi hit its body, sending it flying. Its body was covered with wounds. It was severely injured and could no longer fight.</p><p>“Blood Blade hand!”</p><p>The ferocious Tiger roared, filled with despair.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Bloody blade hand said savagely.</p><p>“Bloody blade hand, 1 am your opponent!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also rushed out and thrust his spear. A terrifying spear ray shot out toward the bloody swordsman.</p><p>The bloody swordsman did not have time to kill the fierce tiger. He could only turn around and slash at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance was scattered and Lu Ming’s attack was blocked. The long spear trembled continuously.</p><p>“Brat, it’s you again, you … Combat strength!”</p><p>The bloody swordsman was shocked. He realized that Lu Ming’s combat strength had improved a lot since the last time.</p><p>“Blood Bladesman, our battle isn’t over yet. Let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed forward and engaged the bloody swordsman in a fierce battle.</p><p>“Senior, quickly leave!”</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the fierce tiger.</p><p>“Young friend, thank you!”</p><p>The ferocious Tiger thanked Lu Ming and turned to leave.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and the bloody swordsman had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>Lu Ming was still no match for the bloody swordsman. However, he was much better than before.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was completely at the bottom and was injured by the other party, it was not serious and he could still resist it.</p><p>Lu Ming did his best to fight the bloody swordsman.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged more than twenty moves. Lu Ming finally retreated with serious injuries.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the six-feathered divine wings, turned around, and fled. His speed was faster than before, and the bloody swordsman could not catch up with him at all.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, damn it!”</p><p>The bloody swordsman was so angry that he was about to vomit blood.</p><p>He knew that he had been targeted by Lu Ming and he could not get rid of him.</p><p>If he had known that this would happen, he would not have taken action against Lu Ming back then. It was too late for him to regret.</p><p>Following that, no matter what method the bloody swordsman came up with, he could not shake Lu Ming off.</p><p>Every once in a while, Lu Ming would look for him and fight with him.</p><p>However, he did not dare to leave the battlefield and return to two world city because Lu Ming had been keeping an eye on him. He was afraid that Lu Ming would report him when he returned to two world city. If that happened, he would die without a burial.</p><p>Half a year passed just like that.</p><p>In the past six months, Lu Ming had fought more than ten battles with the bloody swordsman. His progress was astonishing.</p><p>The bloody swordsman was the best magic Refining Stone. Its combat strength was slightly higher than Lu Ming’s, but not by much. Every time, Lu Ming could fight with all his might.</p><p>In the past six months, Lu Ming’s engulfing laws and array Dao laws had broken through to the third realm.</p><p>The breakthrough of the two King path laws had caused Lu Ming’s combat strength to soar to the thirteenth level of the true Emperor.</p><p>“It’s time to end him!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming decided to get rid of the bloody swordsman.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming caught up to the bloody swordsman and launched an attack.</p><p>“Brat, let’s die together!”</p><p>The bloody swordsman was about to go crazy as he attacked Lu Ming frantically.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was only one rank lower than the bloody swordsman’S. He was not afraid of the latter at all.</p><p>Lu Ming used a lose-lose strategy and eventually severely injured the bloody swordsman while his own injuries recovered rapidly.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His long spear was like a rainbow, piercing through the void..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
