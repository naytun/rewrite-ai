Every bolt of lightning was covered in a layer of purple flames. Those were heavenly flames with astonishing temperatures. They could burn everything with infinite power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The purple fire lightning streaked across the sky and struck Lu Ming continuously. Lu Ming’s body was covered in wisps of lightning and a layer of flames at the same time.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi…</p><p>The lightning and flames attacked continuously, burning Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>I’m starting to feel it. Come on, come on, come harder!</p><p>There was a look of excitement in Lu Ming’s eyes. He allowed the lightning and fire to attack his body but he did not resist at all.</p><p>His body was so strong that the third lightning punishment couldn’t hurt him at all. Instead, it could help him temper his body and improve its strength.</p><p>“This pervert!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>This was the third lightning tribulation. However, judging from Lu Ming’s state, he was clearly very relaxed and did not even use the law.</p><p>The third lightning tribulation was a life-and-death tribulation for ordinary people. They could be turned into ashes by the lightning tribulation at any time. However, to Lu Ming, it was just an appetizer.</p><p>“I wonder how many major calamities Lu Ming will face!”</p><p>it’s hard to say. Before becoming a sovereign, he has mastered so many kinds of nomologicai laws, even three of them are the strongest ones. Moreover, he has also undergone the sovereign tribulation. This is unprecedented in ancient times. Such a person is completely against the heavens. I’m afraid the lightning is also unusually terrifying!</p><p>that’s right. The Tribulation clouds cover 100000 miles. From the looks of it, there must be at least seven major tribulations, or even higher!</p><p>“Heavens, seven major tribulations, how terrifying is that?”</p><p>“I’ve gained a lot of knowledge today!”</p><p>The surrounding people looked on in fear.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was completely submerged in the sea of lightning, bathing in the purple Heavenly Fire.</p><p>His body was being refined continuously. It became crystal clear and dazzling, like a holy weapon. It was stronger than before.</p><p>Not long after, the purple flame lightning tribulation disappeared. He had passed the third lightning tribulation.</p><p>However, the Tribulation clouds were rolling and the Thunder was roaring. The aura was even more oppressive.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Bolts of lightning tore through the void and struck at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tribulation cloud didn’t even need to be prepared. The fourth tribulation came out right after the third tribulation, not giving the person who was going through the Tribulation a chance to breathe.</p><p>This time, the lightning had four colors.</p><p>There were four different colors of lightning, and the surface of each lightning was covered with different things.</p><p>Some of them were covered in flames, some were covered in gales, some were covered in ice, and some were covered in a sharp golden aura.</p><p>This lightning tribulation was several times more powerful than the pure purple flame lightning tribulation.</p><p>Bolts of tribulation lightning instantly drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming still did not use the law to resist. He simply used his physical body to withstand it and used the power of the lightning tribulation to temper his body.</p><p>When the lightning tribulation struck Lu Ming, his body trembled slightly as he felt a sharp pain.</p><p>“Good, this is the feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright and there was a hint of madness in them. Fie allowed the lightning to strike him continuously.</p><p>Wounds began to appear on Lu Ming’s body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>The power of the lightning seeped into the wound and circulated throughout Lu Ming’s body, trying to destroy it.</p><p>However, the vitality of Lu Ming’s physical body was too strong. Even without using the life law, his recovery rate was astonishing.</p><p>His physical body had just been destroyed, but it was immediately restored. At the same time, it made his physical body even stronger.</p><p>The fourth type of lightning tribulation was passed through in this cycle.</p><p>After the fourth lightning tribulation, a Goshawk, completely made of lightning, flew down from the Tribulation cloud and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The fifth lightning tribulation, lightning manifestation!</p><p>Lu Ming had experienced these lightning tribulations when he went through the martial Royal ordeal in the past. He was very familiar with the process.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not rely solely on his physical body to resist it. Instead, he circulated his holy power.</p><p>The lightning tribulation was more and more terrifying. The fifth tribulation was undoubtedly more powerful. If he only relied on his physical body, he would probably be seriously injured.</p><p>With his physical body and Saint energy, Lu Ming threw a punch at the goshawk.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The goshawk was sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, there was still a trace of lightning energy that flowed through Lu Ming’s fist and into his entire body.</p><p>However, this little bit of lightning was harmless to Lu Ming. It could be used to temper his body and Saint power. It could even surge into the dantian Saint heart to help the evolution of the world core and the small world.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation was both a tribulation and an opportunity.</p><p>Those who could cross it would obtain endless benefits from the heaven realm.</p><p>Those who could not cross it would be a calamity and would be struck into ashes.</p><p>Screeches were heard as goshawks continuously formed in the Tribulation clouds and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Other than the goshawk, there were also giant tigers, true dragons, phoenixes, and so on.</p><p>Each one was more shocking than the last, and the number was increasing.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and kept punching out with both fists, fighting against the divine beasts transformed from lightning.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were constant rumbles in the void. The lightning-formed divine beasts were sent flying by Lu Ming. Every time they collided with the lightning-formed divine beasts, the power of lightning would surge into Lu Ming’s body and be used by him.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his physical body had become stronger, his Saint energy had become more condensed, and the evolution of the world core had become faster.</p><p>However, more and more godly beasts rushed out of the Tribulation clouds. In the end, there were a shocking 81 godly beasts.</p><p>The eighty lightning creatures surrounded Lu Ming and attacked him continuously, putting him under great pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth. He still did not use the law to resist it. He only used his physical body and Saint energy to resist it. This way, he would be able to obtain the greatest opportunity from the lightning tribulation.</p><p>If he used a law to disperse the lightning tribulation, he wouldn’t be able to use it to temper his body and Saint power.</p><p>this guy is actually using the heavenly Tribulation to improve himself. This is too shocking!</p><p>that’s right. He’s really abnormal. When other people undergo their tribulations, they just want to get through it quickly. But he’s deliberately dilly-dallying. He’s using the power of the lightning tribulation to temper himself!</p><p>“This kid is terrifying!”</p><p>Some powerful existences were discussing in low voices.</p><p>The faces of the LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor, Lan Cheng, and the Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor became more and more gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming took the longest time to complete the fifth round of lightning tribulation. It took him a full hour.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that his physical body had improved again. It was three levels stronger than before.</p><p>At the same time, he had condensed three levels of Saint energy. If Lu Ming were to fight with Mingsheng now, he would not need to merge the law of chaos and the law of death. He could fight against Mingsheng and resist his mountain river palm.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming felt that the effect of this lightning tribulation on his tempering was getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>This lightning tribulation was useless to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming erupted with the power of the law.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The power of Lu Ming’s punch suddenly increased sharply. With one punch, a Giant Tiger was blown to pieces.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s every punch caused a living being condensed from lightning to explode.</p><p>The eighty-one lightning tribulation creatures were all blown up by Lu Ming in the blink of an eye and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>He had passed the fifth lightning tribulation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
