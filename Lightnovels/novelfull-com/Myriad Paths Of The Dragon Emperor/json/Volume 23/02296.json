He thrust the spear forward and its radiance burst forth. In an instant, more than ten alien races were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was almost unrivaled among the true emperors. Even if he encountered a rank-18 true Emperor, he could defeat them with the help of the profoundness of the indestructible ancient scroll.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming seemed to have entered a no man’s land. He did not put up any defense at all and attacked with all his might, killing the alien races one after another.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming passed, the alien races fell to the ground like raindrops.</p><p>However, there were too many alien races. They were much more in number and had more experts.</p><p>Miserable shrieks rose and fell. People from the heaven realm were also constantly being killed and fallen here.</p><p>Especially in the battle between the great emperor realm experts, the heaven realm was at a disadvantage. Some great emperor realm experts had already fallen.</p><p>The situation was extremely disadvantageous to them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A rank 18 true Emperor alien had his eyes on Lu Ming and was charging towards him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided continuously. Lu Ming disregarded his own defense and launched a frenzied attack.</p><p>Lu Ming hit the other party and the other party hit Lu Ming as well. The two of them retreated while coughing blood.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the imperishable golden body and his defense was astonishing. In addition to his breakthrough in the life law, the power of the indestructible ancient scroll was even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were healing continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about his injuries at all. He rushed towards the other party again and fought with all his might.</p><p>The alien roared and charged at Lu Ming with a ferocious expression.</p><p>The two of them continued to exchange blows. After more than ten moves, the alien was finally defeated. Lu Ming could recover quickly, but the alien could not.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming became one with the spear. He thrust his spear forward and pierced the other party’s head.</p><p>A rank-18 true Emperor powerhouse was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current strength was truly at the peak of the true Emperor realm.</p><p>With a sweep of his World Energy, he pulled the corpse into his small world. Lu Ming then used his six-feathered divine wings to attack a non-human with the combat power of a level seventeen true Emperor.</p><p>After a few moves, the alien was also killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered. He specifically picked some top-notch true emperors to kill.</p><p>For example, a level 16 true Emperor, a level 17 true Emperor…</p><p>In this way, Ren Chan and the others could finally take a breather.</p><p>“Go and kill that brat!”</p><p>In the sky, a non-human Emperor stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were more great emperors of the non-human race, and they could easily take out some to do other things.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A non-human Emperor charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted. His current combat strength was almost invincible in the true Emperor realm. However, he was no match for a great emperor. Even the weakest great emperor could kill him easily.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the celestial Thearch’s physical body.</p><p>Initially, there were too many foreign tribe experts and many top-notch great emperors. Even if Lu Ming used the celestial Thearch’s physical body, it would not be of much use to the overall situation.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming planned to save it for critical moments. However, he had no choice but to use it now.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to use the celestial Thearch’s physical body, a terrifying and shocking pressure burst out from the depths of the small world.</p><p>That was the might of the heavens, the might of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>The celestial Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>It was said that there was another Celestial Emperor in this small world. It seemed that it was true.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>The heaven realm’s cultivators roared and became excited.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the depths of the small world, a few sword lights shot out. Wherever the sword lights passed, the space was torn apart, leaving hideous cracks.</p><p>A few sword-lights were aimed at the few great emperors. One of them was the great emperor who was about to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>The alien expert roared as he retreated in fear.</p><p>However, how could their speed compare to the celestial Thearch’s? they couldn’t retreat at all.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A few emperors of the non-human race were killed by a few sword lights. Then, a sword light flashed in the void, and an old man with white hair and a long robe appeared.</p><p>This was the old ancestor of this small world, a Celestial Emperor, known as the celestial Emperor extinctive sword!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor extinctive sword’s sword let out a deafening howl as a sword-light burst forth from his hand. He was about to attack the non-human Emperor again.</p><p>However, at this moment, Celestial Emperor Jue Jian’s expression changed drastically. His sword momentum changed and turned into a brilliant and huge sword light, slashing towards a side of the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The void exploded, and a huge hand covered in purple scales appeared. It collided with the sword light.</p><p>After a shocking roar, the sword light dissipated and the big hand also shrank back. A few scales on the big hand were cut off, and a trace of blood oozed out.</p><p>Then, the void trembled, and a burly alien appeared in the sky.</p><p>This foreign being also exuded a terrifying pressure that was not weaker than heavenly Emperor jujian’s.</p><p>He was also a powerful existence in the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be a heavenly Emperor who slipped through the net. You can’t be left alive. Today is the day of your death!</p><p>The foreign celestial Thearch said coldly as he charged towards celestial Thearch juexian.</p><p>The celestial Emperor extinctive sword’s body burst out with a brilliant sword light as he fought with his opponent. At the same time, a voice rang in the ears of everyone in the heaven realm.</p><p>“Don’t linger in battle, charge out!”</p><p>The voice of the celestial Emperor extinctive sword rang out.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The five elders and the other great emperor powerhouses gathered with Lu Ming and the rest. They rushed to the front and charged out without a care for their lives.</p><p>“All of you, stay!”</p><p>The outsiders roared and surrounded them, not giving them a chance.</p><p>“You guys go first!”</p><p>“We must rush out!”</p><p>Two of the elders roared. Their bodies emitted a brilliant radiance that burned like flames.</p><p>The two founding elders were going all out. They burned their own origins to increase their strength and block a large number of alien experts.</p><p>“Doyen!”</p><p>Many people howled in grief.</p><p>Burning one’s life source would definitely exhaust one’s life force and one would die without a doubt.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The elder roared.</p><p>“Charge out with us, kill!”</p><p>The remaining doyens and great emperor realm experts led everyone to charge forward.</p><p>Two elders tried their best to stop them, but they finally broke through the encirclement and rushed toward the exit of the small world.</p><p>Behind them, the alien races were chasing after them at an extreme speed. In the process of running away, there were still people dying.</p><p>Soon, they saw the exit of the small world.</p><p>At this moment, the exit of the small world had been torn open by the alien race, and the exit had expanded hundreds of times.</p><p>They immediately rushed out.</p><p>However, when they rushed out, their expressions became even uglier.</p><p>In front of him was a dense crowd of non-humans, forming an arc that surrounded the exit of the small world.</p><p>Obviously, the alien race had come prepared.</p><p>Moreover, he saw two burly men in front of the alien tribe. They were from the heaven realm and Lu Ming had seen them before.</p><p>The two burly men looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a cold smile.</p><p>“Nangong Kang, it’s you! You betrayed the small world, you betrayed us!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>They finally knew why the alien races had found the entrance to the small world. It was because someone had betrayed them..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
