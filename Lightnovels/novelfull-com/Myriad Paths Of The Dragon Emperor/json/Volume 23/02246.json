He looked down from above and continuously struck out with his palms.</p><p>This time, four palm prints of mountains and rivers came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This level of power could be said to be incomparably shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely grave as he felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>He pushed his cultivation to the extreme. At the same time, he held the hammer of chaos in his right hand and held the void in his left hand. A battle sword formed in the void. It was the sword of death and was also made up of seven nomological laws.</p><p>death rule! Lu Ming has really mastered two ultimate maxims!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>It was one thing to hear about it, but it was another to see it with their own eyes. At this moment, they had seen Lu Ming cast two ultimate maxims with their own eyes. This impact was too great for them.</p><p>such talent. It’s a pity he can’t become a saint Emperor. If he could, how amazing would he be?”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor-level figure sighed.</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor, the Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor, and his master from the eternal Star River all had gloomy expressions.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the hammer of chaos in one hand and the sword of death in the other. He soared into the sky and attacked his opponent.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The hammer of chaos and the sword of death struck at each other.</p><p>The entire world was boiling as explosions rang out continuously, causing the void to split apart.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His opponent’s first mountain river World crumbled in an instant, followed by the second, and then the third.</p><p>With a final deafening boom, Lu Ming broke through the fourth level of the mountain river World.</p><p>However, Lu Ming himself was also sent flying by the terrifying force. He flew tens of thousands of meters away. His qi and blood churned, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, Mingsheng was not in a good state either. His palm force was broken and Lu Ming’s terrifying attack was charging towards him, causing him to retreat frantically.</p><p>This time, it was a draw.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure stopped. The six-feathered galloping beast flapped its wings fiercely. Its figure was like a bolt of lightning, drawing an arc in the air and charging towards Ming Sheng.</p><p>“4th level mountain river palm!”</p><p>Mingsheng shouted and once again cast the quadruple mountain and river palm. The quadruple mountain and river World formed and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them collided once again, and then quickly retreated.</p><p>it’s said that when the mountain river palm is cultivated to the highest realm, one can cultivate nine levels of the mountain river World. It’s extremely terrifying. Now, it seems that Mingsheng has only cultivated it to the fourth level!</p><p>that’s right. However, the fourth level of the mountain river palm is definitely shocking. I didn’t expect Lu Ming to be able to fight with Mingsheng to this extent!</p><p>Some people sighed. Even though they had seen it with their own eyes, they still felt that it was unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Ming and Mingsheng had similar combat strength. The two of them exchanged ten moves in a row and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>Mingsheng’s expression became more and more unsightly.</p><p>Using the quadruple-realm mountain river palm consumed a shocking amount of world power. If this continued, he would not be able to hold on any longer.</p><p>no, 1 can’t be defeated. How can I be defeated by a quasi-Emperor? 1 must defeat him and obtain the indestructible ancient scroll!</p><p>Mingsheng roared in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, Mingsheng’s aura became even stronger. The power of the world in his body seemed to be burning.</p><p>Mingsheng was going to risk his life!</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned serious.</p><p>“Fivefold mountain river palm!”</p><p>Mingsheng shouted. His long hair fluttered. His palm seemed to push the world forward. As he pushed out, layers of mountain river World formed.</p><p>In the end, a total of five layers of mountain river World stacked together and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>With Mingsheng’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to unleash the fifth level of the mountain river World. Now that he had forcefully unleashed it, he would suffer a backlash and be seriously injured.</p><p>But now, in order to win against Lu Ming, he could not care anymore.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Mingsheng’s eyes flashed with ferocity.</p><p>A fifth level mountain river realm was much more powerful than a fourth level mountain river realm. This move was enough to crush Lu Ming and defeat him.</p><p>The indestructible ancient scroll was his!</p><p>Mingsheng roared in his heart.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming stood still in the void. The world of five mountains and rivers enveloped the void and pressed down on Lu Ming. Under the World of five mountains and rivers, Lu Ming’s figure was as small as an ant.</p><p>“Lu Ming is still going to be defeated!”</p><p>Some people sighed.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming should have reached his limit. If he had already reached his limit, he would not be a match for this move.</p><p>Only dandan had a sneer on the corner of her mouth.</p><p>He knew that Lu Ming had not used his ultimate move.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The heavens and earth rumbled and the void trembled. The world of five mountains and rivers pressed down, getting closer and closer to Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming raised his hands high, one hand holding the hammer of chaos and the other holding the sword of death.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming put his hands together, combining the hammer of chaos and the sword of death.</p><p>The moment they merged, Lu Ming held the sword with both hands and a dazzling radiance burst out. Then, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>This spear contained eight types of laws.</p><p>Chaos, death, devour, extremity, penetration, array Dao, smithing Dao, and alchemy Dao!</p><p>“Infinite Dragon Spear!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. This was the name he had given to this move. It had the same name as the long spear that he had used in the past.</p><p>The long spear broke through the air, and a shocking spear radiance pierced through the void, stabbing towards the five level mountain river World.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The world of five mountains and rivers exploded one after another. In an instant, the world of five mountains and rivers completely collapsed. A terrifying power surged towards Ming Sheng.</p><p>Mingsheng screamed and flew out. His body almost exploded. He was covered in wounds. His face was pale and he spat out blood.</p><p>He had barely managed to use the fifth level of the mountain river World, and he was already injured.</p><p>Now, he was swept by the aftermath of Lu Ming’s destruction of the fifth level mountain river World. His injuries were even more serious and he was extremely dispirited.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arm was covered in wounds and blood was flowing out.</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hand disappeared. He circulated the life law and the wound on his arm healed quickly.</p><p>“It’s much better than before!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>When he was at the Gu family, he had fused the Laws of Chaos and the laws of death to form a magical power Technique. The more power he unleashed, the more serious his injuries would be.</p><p>But now, it was much lighter.</p><p>This was because his usage of the laws in the ancient undying city had improved a lot. It was also easier for him to control the fusion of the two ultimate laws.</p><p>In just a few breaths, the wound on Lu Ming’s arm had healed.</p><p>This scene was seen by some powerful existences.</p><p>“Then … That’s the law of life!”</p><p>One of the emperors ‘eyes widened as his voice trembled with disbelief.</p><p>“Heavens, it really is the life law!”</p><p>this little guy has not only mastered the Laws of Chaos, the laws of death, and the laws of life!</p><p>Some experts couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>His words stirred up a Thousand Waves. The scene began to quiet, and then it was noisy..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
