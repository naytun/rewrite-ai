If it weren’t for my unparalleled divine skills, you wouldn’t have been able to see me!</p><p>Dandan started sighing, but she quickly regained her spirits and said,”Who’s the oldest in the Gu family now?”</p><p>the oldest member of the Gu family is ancestor Ling Tian’s son, ancestor Gu Xinghui!</p><p>“Gu Xinghui, so it’s that little brat. Ask him to come and see me!”</p><p>Dandan said in a carefree manner, with the appearance of a senior expert.</p><p>The other members of the Gu family felt their eyelids twitching, and their expressions turned ugly.</p><p>Gu Xinghui was the old ancestor of the Gu family. He had lived since the ancient times and had lived for a long time. Now, he was called a little brat. What were they then?</p><p>However, when he remembered that the other party was the World Turtle from back then, he felt at ease.</p><p>Back then, the top ten warbeasts were all peak experts. The number of years they had lived was also shocking.</p><p>Senior turtle, please wait a moment. I’ll go report this to the ancestor!</p><p>The master of the Gu family cupped his fists and walked towards the palace in the depths of the Gu family.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not have to wait long before they saw the master of the Gu family and an old man with white hair flying over.</p><p>The old man had a ruddy complexion and white hair. He was in high spirits and his eyes were extremely bright.</p><p>The master of the Gu family followed behind the old man with a respectful expression.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the ancestor!”</p><p>The Gu family members bowed to the old man at the same time.</p><p>Needless to say, this person was the oldest ancestor of the Gu family, Gu Xinghui.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui waved his hand and looked at dandan. He spread out his spiritual sense to sense dandan’s aura, and a hint of joy appeared on his face. “Senior turtle, it’s you!”</p><p>hahaha, that’s me. You little brat, I haven’t seen you for so many years and you’ve become so old. Haha, I’m still the younger one!</p><p>Dandan laughed.</p><p>senior turtle, I just heard that there’s a young brother who has yet to become a sovereign, but he has already mastered many nomological laws, even two ultimate maxims. Are you here for the method left behind by father? ”</p><p>Gu Xinghui asked directly.</p><p>that’s right. I heard that Gu Lingtian has been researching for his entire life, and when he was about to die, he gained a lot. So, 1 want to see what he has found!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Gu Xinghui looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>He had lived for a long time. When he heard that someone could control so many laws, even two ultimate laws, before becoming a sovereign, even he couldn’t help but be shocked and curious.</p><p>“Little brother, can you show me your nomological laws?”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. With a thought, seven types of laws appeared one after another.</p><p>Gu Xinghui’s eyes were extremely bright as he sighed repeatedly,” miracle, what a miracle!</p><p>After a while, he said,” my father did have a great breakthrough back then. He said that he finally found the way to become a saint Emperor. Unfortunately, he couldn’t reach it himself. He could only leave it to the fated!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and his heart could not help but beat faster.</p><p>Gu Xinghui’s words obviously meant that Gu Lingtian had really found a way back then.</p><p>haha, Gu Lingtian is indeed a rare hero. I didn’t expect him to find a way. It’s a pity for him. If he wasn’t so ambitious, his achievements wouldn’t be any less than mine!</p><p>Dandan sighed. It was rare to see such an exaggerated person.</p><p>Gu Xinghui’s eyes were also a little dim.</p><p>Senior turtle, please follow me!</p><p>Said Gu Xinghui. Then, he made a gesture of invitation and walked towards the depths of the Gu family.</p><p>Lu Ming, dandan, and Mu Lan followed.</p><p>The other members of the Gu family also left.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two followed Gu Xinghui and flew across a large area of halls, arriving at a peaceful place.</p><p>It was very quiet here, and there was only a small house made of purple bamboo.</p><p>It was quiet and elegant.</p><p>There was a small courtyard outside the small house. There was a stone table with a few stone stools beside it.</p><p>senior turtle, please take a seat. I’ll be right back!</p><p>Gu Xinghui said and then walked into the bamboo house. After a while, he took out a bronze box and walked out.</p><p>“This is what my father left behind!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui said. Then, he opened the bronze box, and a Jade box appeared.</p><p>my father put all his research in this Jade box. However, no one has been able to open it since my father passed away. There is a formation on it. If you open it by force, the jade box and the things inside it will be destroyed!</p><p>Gu Xinghui said.</p><p>“It can’t be opened? It can’t be!”</p><p>Dandan was speechless.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank.</p><p>that’s right. However, I’m guessing that father wants to leave it for someone fated, such as young brother Lu Ming, who has yet to become a great emperor but has already mastered many types of laws. Young brother Lu Ming, you can take a look at it. Perhaps you can open it!</p><p>Gu Xinghui passed the jade box to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and studied it carefully.</p><p>The surface of the jade box was covered with dense runes.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a long time but could not find anything.</p><p>“Let me see!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming passed the jade box to dandan and she studied it carefully.</p><p>He was an expert in formations, and as expected, he had made a huge discovery. His eyes lit up, and he said,” no wonder no one can open it. It turns out that it requires such conditions. Haha!</p><p>“Dandan, you can tell?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course, don’t you know who I am? The head of the top ten Battle Beasts, the world God turtle. I can’t see it without a formation. If you want to open this Jade box, you need two conditions!”</p><p>“First, I need to use Saint energy!”</p><p>second, five types of nomological laws need to be used at the same time, but there are no rules on which five types of nomological laws to use!</p><p>these two conditions are very simple individually, but when put together, it’s very harsh, because the two conditions need to be completed by the same person!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>The few of them were stunned for a moment before they immediately reacted.</p><p>This condition was very obvious. It required a person who had yet to become a divine Emperor but could master five types of laws at the same time. This was what Gu Lingtian had left for people like him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take it and try it!”</p><p>Dandan handed the jade box to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and circulated his holy power according to dandan’s instructions. He controlled the five types of laws at the same time and shrouded the jade box.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As expected, the jade box started to move. It began to glow, and the runes on it flowed. Finally, with a Kacha sound, the jade box opened.</p><p>There was a Jade token in the jade box.</p><p>“It’s open!”</p><p>Gu Xinghui was also very excited.</p><p>Lu Ming, dandan, and Mu Lan were also very excited.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hurry up and take a look. Is there a way for you to successfully vindicate your Dao and become an Emperor?”</p><p>Dandan said excitedly.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath, took out the Jade card, and sank his spiritual sense into it.</p><p>“My life is Gu Lingtian …”</p><p>Immediately, a voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming put down the Jade token and looked surprised.’There, there’s really a way.. I can become an Emperor!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
