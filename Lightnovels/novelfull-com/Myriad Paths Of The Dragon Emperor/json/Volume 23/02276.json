He was in disbelief and was shocked by Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>The others weren’t any better. They were tongue-tied and gasped.</p><p>A seven-star illusionary Emperor was nothing, but this seven-star illusionary Emperor had only become a great emperor two years ago, which was terrifying.</p><p>The rest of the nine-Jue group, such as the bald young man, the young man in the blue shirt, and the beautiful lady, looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Updated on B0XƝ0VEL.COM</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the other celestial emperors were overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming was so talented. If he continued to grow, he might really become a peak expert.</p><p>The people from the heaven realm were shocked, but the outsiders were stunned and looked down on them.</p><p>They did not know that Lu Ming had become a Martial Emperor more than two years ago.</p><p>“Is there really no one else in the heaven realm? They actually sent an illusionary Thearch to die?”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor from the foreign race sneered.</p><p>“So what if you’re an empty Emperor? It’s enough to defeat your so-called heaven’s favorites!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were full of provocation and disdain.</p><p>“Arrogant! Leave this brat to me!”</p><p>Among the four heaven’s favorites, the burly one covered in purple scales stepped out. A giant axe appeared in his hand, and his eyes were ferocious.</p><p>This person was called Wei Mo, and he had easily defeated the Black Tortoise forest in his previous battle.</p><p>No one from the foreign tribes stopped him. In their opinion, Wei Mo alone was enough to deal with a mere void Emperor.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Wei Mo’s body glowed with purple light. He was four meters tall, more than twice Lu Ming’s height. With every step he took, the ground rumbled, as if a giant beast was walking.</p><p>“Brat, 1’11 chop you into pieces with my axe!”</p><p>Wei Mo opened his mouth ferociously, his three eyes emitting a ferocious light.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his middle finger and showed a look of disdain.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wei Mo took a step forward, causing the ground to crack. His burly figure rushed towards Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed. He was in mid-air when he swung his axe at Lu Ming. A terrifying axe radiance split the void into two.</p><p>a sixth stage true Emperor is too weak!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His figure soared into the sky and he charged towards the other party.</p><p>When he encountered the other party’s axe gleam, Lu Ming struck out with his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming used the inextinguishable golden body. His entire body was like a peerless divine weapon. At the same time, the power of the law covered his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The axe gleam was like tofu and could not withstand a single blow. It was immediately destroyed. Lu Ming’s figure did not stop as he charged toward Wei Mo.</p><p>Wei Mo was shocked. He did not expect that the attack that he had used all his strength to launch would be so weak in Lu Ming’s hands. This was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>In his opinion, a mere void Emperor could not be that strong. He would definitely be killed by his axe.</p><p>It was too late to react and Dodge. Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Wei Mo’s face. Wei Mo let out a blood-curdling scream and half of his face exploded. His body fell heavily to the ground, creating a huge pit. He lay in it and twitched non-stop. He was already half-dead.</p><p>The entire place suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but widen their eyes in shock.</p><p>Wei Mo, who had been extremely powerful just now and had easily defeated the profound martial arts world’s Wei Mo, could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming. With just one move, he was crushed by Lu Ming and was severely injured. The impact of this was too strong.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Good hit!”</p><p>The heavenly realm erupted in cheers, and the two world city was in an uproar.</p><p>Many people shouted in excitement.</p><p>It felt too good, too good.</p><p>Earlier on, the heaven realm’s paragons had been suppressed by the other party. Now that Lu Ming had made a move, he could kill one of the other party’s paragons with one slap. This scene was as cool as drinking a glass of cold beer in the summer.</p><p>At first, many people were in despair, but now, they couldn’t help but Show Hope.</p><p>There were even stronger geniuses in the heaven realm.</p><p>Although the heaven’s favorites of the foreign races were strong, they were not undefeatable.</p><p>Of course, there were also a few people who were angry instead of happy. For example, people from the Black Tortoise forest, Lan Cheng, and others who had a grudge against Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it, how did he become so strong? damn it!”</p><p>The Black Tortoise forest roared in his heart. He found it difficult to accept.</p><p>Previously, he had been easily defeated by Wei Mo. Now, Wei Mo could not even withstand a single blow in front of Lu Ming. Did this not mean that he was too trashy?</p><p>His face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lan Cheng coldly snorted, his expression not looking good.</p><p>At the same time, the alien powerhouses also looked terrible.</p><p>The alien race’s prodigy had been defeated by Lu Ming in such a domineering manner. It was a slap to the face. It was really ugly and not good for their plan.</p><p>“Is this your chosen? Too weak, change to another one!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually, looking at the remaining three non-human talents.</p><p>Of the remaining three, other than mo tianluo, the Prince of the foreign race, the other two looked solemn.</p><p>Even if their combat strength was stronger than Wei Mo’s, it was not by much. It was impossible for them to crush Wei Mo as easily as Lu Ming did.</p><p>Even if they went up, they would definitely not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>a seven-star illusionary Emperor with such battle strength. Interesting. Let me test you!</p><p>Mo tianluo stepped out. His purple hair was flying in the wind, and he was extremely handsome.</p><p>In addition, the third eye between his brows was filled with a sense of evil. If he were to enter the human race, he would probably charm thousands of young girls.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His target was the demonic Sky Net.</p><p>“Make your move, don’t waste time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly, as if he did not take the devil-Sky King seriously at all.</p><p>Mo tianluo’s eyes flashed with a hint of gloominess. His purple hair fluttered in the wind, and his body was surrounded by purple Qi.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His eyes shone with a brilliant light, which transformed into a huge combat sword. It slashed at Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and circulated the world Energy to the extreme. At the same time, a long spear containing eight types of laws appeared in his hand.</p><p>Although Lu Ming appeared to be carefree when facing the demon-Sky King, he did not dare to be careless.</p><p>His opponent’s battle strength had already reached the ninth stage true Emperor. His current battle strength was also at the same level as mo tianluo’s.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear expanded and collided with his opponent’s combat sword. There was a loud clang and the force was unrestrained.</p><p>The opponent’s combat sword was destroyed by Lu Ming, and he took a few steps back.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The eyes of the people from the heaven realm lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming had blocked the other party’s attack. This meant that he had the ability to fight.</p><p>At this moment, although many people were shocked by Lu Ming’s combat strength, they hoped that Lu Ming would be able to fight and even defeat the other party.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had blocked his attack, mo tianluo shouted. His third eye continued to shine, turning into more than ten combat swords and slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, his body flashed and he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hand pierced out continuously, blocking more than ten combat swords. In the end, he exchanged a blow with mo tianluo and his figure drifted backward..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
