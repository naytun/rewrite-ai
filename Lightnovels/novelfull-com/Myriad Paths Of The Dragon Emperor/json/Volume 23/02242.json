As long as Lu Ming did not resist, anyone could do it.</p><p>Soon after, dandan waved her hand, and an image appeared in the sky.</p><p>This scene was the scene of Lu Ming at the White jade square in Mount eternal.</p><p>In the sky, the dazzling mark of the heavenly Dao flew into Lu Ming’s glabella. Then, there were images that Lu Ming could not inscribe and the middle-aged man’s explanation.</p><p>Everything was clear. Lu Ming was not lying.</p><p>“How could this be? Detestable!”</p><p>Someone bellowed, revealing a look of deep disappointment.</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor and the others were equally disappointed.</p><p>As for LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others, their faces were ugly.</p><p>He did not expect that the truth was as Lu Ming said.</p><p>At this moment, dandan finished her work and the image disappeared.</p><p>“Everyone, this is the truth. 1 can’t hand over the indestructible ancient scroll now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Since you can’t hand it over, I can only strip your soul and strip you of the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>The celestial Thearch of the LAN family said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted at her words.</p><p>Meanwhile, bubble and dandan were even more furious.</p><p>senior, this is too much. The heavenly Dao mark has already fused into Lu Ming’s soul. If we forcefully remove it, Lu Ming’s soul will definitely not be able to withstand it and will be crippled!</p><p>The master of the Gu family finally couldn’t stand it anymore and spoke.</p><p>The remaining small group of people also couldn’t bear it.</p><p>But most of them had cold eyes.</p><p>“So what if I’m crippled?”</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor said coldly,” he has a crippled body and will never become a saint Emperor. It’s a waste for him to possess the indestructible ancient scroll. Although it’s impossible for everyone to see it, it’s still better to give it to a top heaven’s favorite than to keep it on him!</p><p>Lan Cheng, you’re the heavenly Emperor, yet you’re forcing a junior like this. Don’t you feel ashamed? ”</p><p>At this moment, a disdainful voice sounded.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Who was it that dared to speak to the LAN clan’s celestial Thearch in such a manner?</p><p>At this moment, ripples appeared in the void. With a crack, the space split open and a figure stepped out.</p><p>This person looked to be around 30 years old. He was dressed in white and had an unparalleled charm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened at the sight of this person.</p><p>This was because he was too familiar with this person’s appearance.</p><p>The Heng Yu heavenly Emperor!</p><p>This person was the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor. He looked exactly the same as the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor. Lu Ming could not be mistaken. After all, the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor’s physical body was still in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Back then, heavenly Emperor Heng Yu had told him that he had once been seriously injured, and his soul had almost been destroyed. He had never expected to reform his body and reform it. Later, heavenly Emperor Heng Yu had left his stone body in the primordial realm and suppressed it in the Lotus World. Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu himself had come to the heaven realm and fought in the heaven realm.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to see the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor here.</p><p>“Hengyu, it’s you!”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch’s face darkened.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“Of course it’s me. Why? You’re not happy to see me?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hengyu, you want to stop me?”</p><p>The LAN clan’s celestial Thearch said coldly.</p><p>of course! It’s his own fortune that this little guy can obtain the indestructible ancient scroll. Even if he can inscribe it, he can give it to whoever he wants. It’s his freedom. Besides, he can’t inscribe it now. You, the dignified Celestial Emperor, actually want to strip the indestructible ancient scroll from his soul. This is ridiculous!</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said, his voice filled with anger.</p><p>Hengyu, I’m doing this for the sake of the heaven realm. Right now, the heaven realm is being besieged by the alien races and is in imminent danger. We don’t know when the alien races will break through our defenses. We can’t miss anything that can improve the strength of the heaven realm!</p><p>as for Lu Ming, he’s a cripple. It’s a pure waste to keep the indestructible ancient scroll. It’s best for the heaven realm to extract it and hand it over to another heaven’s favorite. Hengyu, I know that you’re from the primordial realm, just like Lu Ming, but you can’t be selfish at this time!</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor said.</p><p>“Hahaha, selfish? Lan Cheng, we all know who is the one with selfish motives. Let me ask you, if you extract it, who do you plan to give the indestructible ancient scroll to?”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu said.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about this!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor said.</p><p>“I, Hengyu, am here. Let’s see who can touch Lu Ming today!”</p><p>The eternal universe heavenly Emperor said in an extremely domineering manner.</p><p>“Hengyu, do you think you can stop us all by yourself?”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch said coldly as a terrifying aura burst forth from his body.</p><p>At the same time, a few other heavenly emperors did the same. They stared at the Heng Yu heavenly Emperor with unfriendly eyes. One of them was the master of the eternal Star River, the gray-robed elder.</p><p>In addition, the Yan clan’s heavenly Emperor was also among them.</p><p>“Do you really think we’re easy to bully?”</p><p>At this moment, a rough voice rang out. The void then split open and two more figures walked out.</p><p>A burly middle-aged man and an old man stood beside the eternal universe heavenly Emperor, both of them exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>All of them were celestial emperors!</p><p>“What’s wrong? Your primordial realm’s Celestial Emperor wants to rebel and betray the heaven realm first, right?”</p><p>The LAN clan’s celestial Thearch bellowed in fear.</p><p>The two heavenly emperors that came after heavenly Emperor Heng Yu were both from the primordial realm, and their strength was astonishing. They were terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>The LAN clan’s heavenly Emperor was especially wary of the eternal universe heavenly Emperor.</p><p>“What a joke, the few of you can’t represent the heaven realm!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu laughed coldly.</p><p>“Then let’s fight and see if you can protect Lu Ming. I really don’t understand. What’s the point of protecting a cripple? You don’t know the big picture!”</p><p>The master of the eternal Star River, the grey-robed old man, said coldly. He stepped forward in an extremely powerful manner.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming burst out laughing. His laughter was filled with mockery.</p><p>“Kid, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>The LAN family’s celestial Thearch cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, the celestial thearchs were having a conversation and Lu Ming actually dared to laugh so wantonly. This was disrespectful to them.</p><p>“I’m laughing at you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the LAN family’s celestial Thearch, the gray-robed elder, the Yan family’s celestial Thearch, and the rest.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to laugh at the celestial thearchs. He was audacious and was courting death.</p><p>The LAN family’s heavenly Emperor and the others looked on with cold eyes as a terrifying aura burst forth. However, it was blocked by the heavenly Emperor Heng Yu and the others.</p><p>“Brat, you better explain clearly!”</p><p>The LAN clan’s celestial Thearch said coldly.</p><p>you keep saying that it’s a waste to keep the indestructible ancient scroll with me. In my opinion, that’s funny. It’s a waste to give it to someone else. Only by keeping it with me can it be put to its greatest use!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
