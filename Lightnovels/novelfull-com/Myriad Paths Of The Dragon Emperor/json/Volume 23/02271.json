He began to refine it and improve his cultivation.</p><p>One piece after another, Lu Ming spent the next two months refining the world core.</p><p>Lu Ming was focused on cultivation and was unaware of the outside world.</p><p>As Lu Ming was cultivating, countless alien races were charging toward two world city.</p><p>The outsiders were attacking the city!</p><p>B0xùî´o—µùëíùô°.com</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The massive black battleships, which looked like majestic mountains, tore through the sky and brought up the fierce wind.</p><p>Each of them had a large number of alien experts.</p><p>At a glance, one would not know how many alien races there were and how many battleships there were.</p><p>Two world city was naturally alerted.</p><p>‚ÄúThe outsiders are attacking the city!‚Äù</p><p>His roar echoed throughout two world city.</p><p>In two world city, countless figures rose into the air. Gorgeous rainbows intertwined in the sky. It was extraordinarily beautiful.</p><p>Countless experts appeared on the city walls of two world city.</p><p>‚ÄúActivate the formation!‚Äù</p><p>A voice spread throughout two world city. This was definitely a heavenly Emperor expert.</p><p>Dense runes appeared all over the two world city, especially on the city walls.</p><p>The endless runes interweaved into a terrifying formation.</p><p>The atmosphere in two world city was extremely tense.</p><p>This was a large-scale attack by the foreign races.</p><p>In the past 100000 years, the number of large-scale attacks by the alien races had become less and less. This was because the Tai Qing heavenly region had not been conquered for so many years.</p><p>Many people guessed that the alien races must be gathering strength or planning something else.</p><p>This time, the outsiders were attacking the city again. Had they lost their patience and were going to take two world city by force?</p><p>charge! Break through the walls of two world city!</p><p>A loud roar came from the non-humans.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Huge battleships were charging toward two world city.</p><p>However, even though those warships were huge, they were still far from the city walls of two world city.</p><p>‚ÄúAttack!‚Äù</p><p>After the alien battleship had flown a certain distance, someone on the two world city‚Äôs wall gave the order.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Countless dazzling runes appeared on the city walls. They transformed into formations and then into beams of attacks that attacked the non-human battleships.</p><p>There were giant swords as large as mountains, battle sabers that could break the sky, and so on.</p><p>In addition, there were also huge crossbows on the city walls.</p><p>Each of these crossbows was the size of a small hill, and the arrows were dozens of meters long. They were extremely powerful and could kill a peak true Emperor with one shot.</p><p>In addition, there were also giant orirock cannons.</p><p>This kind of giant cannon was made by refining. It was engraved with arrays and powered by raw stones.</p><p>As long as enough raw gemstones were added, it could produce a terrifying attack that could hit even from ten thousand miles away. Once hit, even a rank 18 true Emperor expert would die.</p><p>Even great emperors didn‚Äôt dare to ignore it.</p><p>These were all great killing weapons of war.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>All sorts of attacks were launched at the alien battleships.</p><p>The non-human battleships lit up with energy shields to resist the attacks of two world city.</p><p>Endless attacks landed on the energy shield, which kept shaking.</p><p>‚ÄúCounterattack!‚Äù</p><p>Some of the alien races roared. The battleships also launched various attacks at two world city, but they were blocked by the light outside the city.</p><p>The two sides attacked from long range and exchanged blows. The entire sky was drowned in dazzling light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of sword radiance shot out from two world city. It was extremely bright among all the other lights.</p><p>The sword light was filled with boundless heaven‚Äôs might. This was the attack of a heavenly Emperor.</p><p>However, a giant axe among the outsiders struck out and blocked the sword light.</p><p>Then, a burly figure appeared in the sky, exuding an earth-shattering aura.</p><p>‚ÄúCelestial Emperor of the heaven realm, come out and fight me!‚Äù</p><p>The burly foreign being opened his mouth and his voice was like thunder that reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not afraid of you!‚Äù</p><p>A brilliant sword light rushed out of two world city and attacked the alien race.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow and then fought their way into the depths of the sky.</p><p>These two people were undoubtedly figures of the heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>The attacks from both sides continued.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Finally, the defense of another alien battleship was broken. Endless attacks landed on the battleship. The battleship was blown up, sending all kinds of metals flying everywhere.</p><p>On the warship, countless alien races were flying around, but many of them were killed by the falling attacks.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>An arrow that was dozens of meters long pierced through the void and sent a peak true Emperor non-human flying a thousand miles.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The other peak true Emperor expert was hit by a beam of light and exploded.</p><p>However, there were a few figures that were unusually powerful. They charged forward and blocked a large number of attacks.</p><p>These were all non-human Emperor-level figures.</p><p>‚ÄúCharge, charge!‚Äù</p><p>The battleships of the foreign races continued to rush toward two world city.</p><p>As they rushed out, more battleships were destroyed, and more alien races were killed.</p><p>However, the battleships of the foreign races were getting closer and closer to two world city.</p><p>In the end, the alien races had lost more than a dozen battleships and thousands of experts. They had finally reached the two world city.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The battleships crashed into the light shield outside two world city.</p><p>The light shield trembled violently and was actually torn apart.</p><p>‚ÄúKill our way in!‚Äù</p><p>The alien race roared and charged in through the openings.</p><p>‚ÄúKill!‚Äù</p><p>On the city walls of two world city, there were also many experts who rushed towards these holes. They fought with the alien races next to the holes. It was a brutal battle.</p><p>At the same time, the formation on the two world city‚Äôs walls was still in operation. It turned into a series of attacks, attacking the foreign kinds.</p><p>This was the advantage of the heaven realm. By relying on the two world city, although they had far fewer experts than the foreign kinds, they could still stop the foreign kinds and their invasion.</p><p>‚ÄúKill, kill!‚Äù</p><p>The killing was unusually brutal. There was no mercy or mercy here, only killing.</p><p>This was a war between two worlds, and it concerned the survival of a world. Only by killing the opponent could one survive!</p><p>Experts from both sides continued to fall and would forever remain here.</p><p>Relatively speaking, the heaven realm‚Äôs side had the upper hand, because the experts of the heaven realm only needed to block those torn holes. With the help of the great formation, it was much easier for them. Although there were some who died in the battle, the number of alien races killed was more than that, double.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The void trembled as figures from the alien race stepped out, exuding terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>Heavenly emperors, they were all heavenly emperors. There were more than ten heavenly emperors.</p><p>More than a dozen heavenly emperors appeared at the same time, and the aura they released was too strong. The heaven and earth seemed to be groaning, unable to bear such a terrifying pressure.</p><p>However, at the same time, a celestial Thearch rushed out from two world city and blocked the other party.</p><p>Battle!</p><p>There was nothing much to say. The heavenly emperors of both sides were engaged in a great battle. Some of them fought into the depths of the sky, while others fought in the dark space..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
