Six different powers complemented each other and burst out with astonishing power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the hammer of chaos and continued to pour holy power into it, making the hammer of chaos bigger and bigger, smashing it forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An iron-armored undead spirit was hit by the chaotic hammer. Its body exploded into pieces of armor and bones.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming swung the hammer again.</p><p>The second armored undead spirit followed in the footsteps of the previous one and exploded.</p><p>The short-haired young man’s expression changed. His hands formed seals even faster, causing ripples in the void. It was as if a mysterious world had been created. Then, a furious roar was heard as a huge object appeared in the sky.</p><p>This was a true dragon. No, to be precise, it was a huge Dragon Bone. However, it was covered in iron armor and emitted a strong aura of death.</p><p>It was an undead dragon Bone!</p><p>“Kill!’’</p><p>The short-haired young man roared. This undead dragon Bone was his most powerful ultimate move.</p><p>The remaining nine iron-armored undead spirits waved their combat swords and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon Bone of the undead roared. It stepped in the air and twisted its body, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Shatter!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed and the surging holy power continuously gushed into the hammer of chaos.</p><p>The hammer of chaos grew larger and larger until it was as large as a mountain.</p><p>This time, three iron-armored undead spirits were smashed by Lu Ming’s hammer and exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the void and swung the hammer of chaos continuously.</p><p>It was a complete suppression!</p><p>Every time he smashed, an iron-armored dead spirit would be smashed to pieces by Lu Ming. In a few breaths, nine iron-armored dead spirits were all smashed to pieces.</p><p>At this moment, a huge Dragon Claw was coming at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming wielded the hammer of chaos and swung it at the Dragon Claw.</p><p>With a violent boom, the giant undead dragon Bone trembled and was forced back.</p><p>Lu Ming caught up with him. He held the hammer with both hands and launched a storm of attacks.</p><p>The short-haired young man’s combat strength was very strong. He was a five-star void Emperor and controlled three types of laws. One was the strongest and two were King path laws.</p><p>The strongest law was the death law, and the king path law was the summoning law. Both of these laws had been cultivated to the second realm.</p><p>In addition, there was another law of corrosion that could be cultivated to the perfection of the first realm.</p><p>The three types of laws combined to form a wondrous magical power that could summon terrifying undead spirits. Their combat strength was very strong.</p><p>However, Lu Ming now had nine types of laws that had reached the completion of the first level. After being tempered by nine types of laws, his body and Saint energy had reached an astonishing level.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming’s usage of the laws had greatly deepened. The power of the self-created hammer of chaos was even more shocking than before.</p><p>With the eruption of six types of laws, Lu Ming’s abilities were completely above that of the short-haired youth.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The chaos hammer kept clashing with the undead Bone Dragon.</p><p>The undead Bone Dragon couldn’t fight back and kept retreating. Its huge body kept shaking, and even one of its claws was blown off.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>The short-haired young man roared. He poured all the world Energy in his body into the dead spirit Dragon Bone, increasing its power.</p><p>However, it was still unnecessary.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming held the hammer of chaos with both hands. The hammer of chaos was like a small mountain and it smashed heavily on the dead spirit Dragon Bone.</p><p>The undead dragon Bone glowed. The air of death mixed with the power of the law of corrosion pounced at Lu Ming with a furious roar.</p><p>Several dragon claws struck out and collided with the hammer of chaos.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The Dragon Claw of the undead dragon Bone exploded, turning into broken bones and flying everywhere.</p><p>Then, the hammer of chaos struck the skull of the undead dragon Bone.</p><p>The skull of the undead spirit Dragon Bone was covered with a layer of thick iron armor. However, under this downward attack, the iron armor burst open, and the skull of the undead spirit Dragon Bone was covered with cracks like a spider web.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming leaped and stepped on the skull of the undead dragon Bone. He stomped with all his might and the skull of the undead dragon Bone burst. Then, the entire Dragon Bone exploded.</p><p>Inch hair Green’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His face was pale.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming made use of the force from his stomp and instantly pounced in front of the short-haired youth.</p><p>The short-haired teenager was shocked and wanted to admit defeat. However, Lu Ming did not give him the chance to do so. He smashed his hammer down.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>The short-haired young man was hit by the hammer directly. His body fell down like a meteorite and smashed into the ground.</p><p>The earth rumbled and dust filled the air. A huge pit was created on the ground. The short-haired young man lay in the pit like a dead dog. He was bloodthirsty and twitching non-stop.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, this person would have been crushed to death by Lu Ming.</p><p>this kind of trash is still thinking about the indestructible ancient scroll? isn’t it a waste to give it to such a person? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully. He looked at the LAN family’s heavenly Emperor, Lan Cheng, and his voice was filled with ridicule.</p><p>Lan Cheng’s face was extremely gloomy, and his heart was filled with anger.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was just an ant. An ant actually dared to provoke him and mock him. He was simply audacious.</p><p>However, there were so many people here, and with his identity as the heavenly Emperor, it was naturally not appropriate for him to make a move. He could only suppress his anger and snorted coldly.</p><p>“This guy is so strong?”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, and Yuan Xin all had gloomy eyes.</p><p>Tian Ming, who was wearing a white robe, stood in the void with a thoughtful look in his eyes.</p><p>The others were also extremely shocked.</p><p>It was the first time that many of them had seen Lu Ming in action. They could not help but widen their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>He was only an Emperor-to-be, but not only could he cross realms to fight with the Martial Emperor realm, he could also cross so many small realms.</p><p>The short-haired young man was a five-star illusionary Emperor. Moreover, he was not an ordinary five-star illusionary Emperor. He was a top-notch heaven’s favorite. There was such a huge difference between them, but he was still defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>This was simply unheard of, unprecedented, and had never happened in history.</p><p>Regardless of whether Lu Ming could become a Martial Emperor or not, this level of combat strength had created history.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A voice immediately sounded. A black-robed young man with long hair flew out.</p><p>His speed was very fast, as if he was traveling through the void. He took a step and suddenly appeared not far away from Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s Ming Sheng, he’s about to make his move!”</p><p>it’s said that Mingsheng has already reached the level of a six-star illusionary Emperor. His comprehension of the laws is even more profound. He will definitely be able to defeat Lu Ming with this!</p><p>that’s right. Mingsheng’s core nomological laws are the nomological laws of time and space. When combined with other nomological laws, the magical power it develops is unpredictable and its strength is unfathomable!</p><p>As soon as the black-clad young man appeared, the crowd burst into a discussion. It was obvious that the black-clad young man was very famous..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
