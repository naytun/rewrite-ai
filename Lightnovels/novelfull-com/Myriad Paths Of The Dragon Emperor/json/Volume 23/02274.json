He was actually able to block his opponent. The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves in an instant, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>interesting, you can actually keep up with my speed. But let me tell you, I’m only halfway there!</p><p>The skinny alien laughed coldly. Suddenly, his speed increased once more, and his four sharp weapons began to move at double the speed they had before.</p><p>The bald young man was shocked. He roared and circulated his fist technique to the extreme.</p><p>However, he was still no match for the other party and was not faster than him.</p><p>Updated on B0XƝ0VEL.COM</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A wound appeared on the bald youth’s body, almost cutting his body in half. Blood was flowing out.</p><p>The bald youth retreated frantically, trying to avoid his opponent’s attack. However, his opponent’s figure didn’t stop, and neither did his attacks. He couldn’t avoid it at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The bald young man was hit again. His body was slashed, and this time, one of his arms was cut off. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and revealed a look of despair.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The skinny non-human’s eyes were Savage as he charged toward the bald youth.</p><p>“I admit defeat, 1 admit defeat!”</p><p>At the critical moment, the bald man shouted.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The petite young man didn’t stop and continued to attack the bald young man.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>One of the celestial thearchs beside heavenly venerate six sages made his move. A wave of power enveloped the bald youth and swept him up to his side, hehe, you need the celestial Thearch to make a move? what a waste!</p><p>The skinny foreign man sneered and looked at the bald youth with disdain. Then, he stepped back.</p><p>The bald youth’s expression was extremely unsightly. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and then sat down cross-legged to heal his injuries.</p><p>Heavenly venerate six sages and the few heavenly emperors also had ugly expressions on their faces.</p><p>When the heavenly Emperor saved the bald youth, the other party’s heavenly Emperor did not stop him. Perhaps, the other party did it on purpose.</p><p>The bald youth’s defeat and the heavenly Emperor’s intervention were witnessed by countless people from both sides. This was a huge blow to the heaven realm.</p><p>Their top geniuses were no match for the heavenly Emperor and needed the heavenly Emperor to save them. How ironic was this?</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Some people in the heaven realm looked desperate.</p><p>If their overall strength could not compare to the outsiders, and even the geniuses of this generation could not compare to the outsiders, then what hope did the heaven realm have?</p><p>If he struggled on his last breath, he would be defeated and destroyed by the other party sooner or later.</p><p>At this moment, there were still two heaven’s favorites who had yet to make a move. The non-human who was like a shadow stepped out and said in a cold and harsh voice,” “Which one of you is going to fight me?”</p><p>There were still two young heaven’s favorites from the heaven realm.</p><p>One of them was a beautiful woman, and the other was a handsome young man in a blue shirt.</p><p>I’ll deal with this person. As for the Royal non-human race, I’ll have to rely on you. I’m definitely not his match!</p><p>At this moment, the beautiful woman said to the young man in blue.</p><p>There were also differences in the nine absolutes of the heaven realm’s youth.</p><p>The young man in blue was one of the top nine absolutes. He was ranked in the top three.</p><p>“Alright, no matter what, we can’t lose the next two matches!”</p><p>The young man in blue said.</p><p>alright, the beautiful lady nodded her head and floated out. Without saying anything, she started to fight with the shadow-like evil god race member.</p><p>The two of them should be at the seventh stage true Emperor realm. This battle was very intense.</p><p>However, the other party’s body was extremely strange. Not only was it like a shadow, but it could also launch soul attacks.</p><p>After dozens of moves, the beautiful woman was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The people from the heaven realm cried out in disbelief.</p><p>How could there be so many powerful heaven’s favorites from the alien race? they are even more terrifying than the heaven realm. This is really despairing.</p><p>“No, I can’t be defeated!”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s eyes flashed with ruthlessness. Suddenly, she no longer defended and let the other party stab her. She seized this opportunity and attacked with all her might.</p><p>This was a lose-lose fighting method, but it was effective. Obviously, the opponent had not expected the beautiful woman to be so ruthless and be hit in one move.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them were forced back. The beautiful woman spat out a mouthful of blood. Her body was almost torn apart by the sword Qi and she was severely injured.</p><p>However, the other party was not in a good state either. He was hit by the beautiful woman’s full-force attack and was also seriously injured.</p><p>Both sides were injured!</p><p>On the heavenly realm’s side, after the beautiful woman’s all-out attack, the battle finally ended in a draw.</p><p>However, no one in the heavenly realm was happy. There was only despair.</p><p>The evil god Realm had also given birth to such a powerful heaven’s favorite. What hope did the heaven realm have?</p><p>“It seems that you came prepared today. The four of them should be the strongest heaven’s favorites in your world, right?”</p><p>A heavenly Emperor from the heaven realm spoke.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up. It was possible that the alien race had come prepared. They might have brought the strongest heaven’s favorites here, which was why they were so strong.</p><p>As for the heaven realm, not all of the nine absolutes were present. There were still some geniuses who were still growing. If that was the case, then there was hope.</p><p>“You don’t have to lie to yourselves. 1’11 tell you the truth. The three people who fought just now can’t even enter the top ten in my Jie!”</p><p>A non-human heavenly Emperor sneered.</p><p>“You can’t even enter the top ten? That’s impossible, absolutely impossible!”</p><p>it’s fake. It’s definitely just an alarmist talk. It’s probably a blow to us!</p><p>“We can’t believe it!”</p><p>Everyone in the heaven realm was in an uproar. No one believed it.</p><p>The three outsiders who had just fought were already unbelievably powerful. Even nine absolutes from the heaven realm was no match for them. With such combat strength and cultivation, they still couldn’t enter the top ten of the outsiders. This was too despairing.</p><p>They naturally didn’t believe it.</p><p>how sad. No wonder you were defeated. 1 swear in the name of the heavenly Emperor that all of this is the truth!</p><p>The heavenly Emperor from the foreign race said indifferently.</p><p>Everyone in the heaven realm was in despair. Was what the other party said true?</p><p>this is a Prince of our realm. He has amazing talent and is ranked ninth among the younger generation in our realm!</p><p>Then, the non-human heavenly Emperor pointed at the non-human young man.</p><p>The young man from the royal family stepped forward and looked at the young man in blue, remember, my name is mo tianluo, and I will crush you!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The young man in blue stepped forward and launched an attack at the Prince of the alien race, mo tianluo.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The blue divine light turned into a series of shocking attacks. The young man in blue revealed his terrifying combat strength as soon as he attacked.</p><p>“Rank 8 true Emperor!”</p><p>The eyes of the people from the heaven realm lit up. They saw hope.</p><p>The blue-shirted young man’s battle power had already reached the battle power of a rank eight true Emperor. At such a young age, he was definitely powerful.</p><p>“You have some strength, but it’s not enough!”</p><p>Mo tianluo said indifferently. A destructive light burst out of his eyes, turning into a dozen sword lights and slashing toward the blue-robed young man.</p><p>The sword light whistled and broke through the attack of the young man in blue, forcing him to retreat quickly.</p><p>“What? He’s so strong!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>How was it possible for him to force the blue-robed young man to retreat with a single move?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! mo tianluo shouted. The sword light whistled and slashed at the young man in blue.</p><p>The young man in blue let out a long roar and soared into the sky. He used a terrifying Divine Art to break the sword light and attacked mo tianluo.</p><p>“I’ll defeat you!”</p><p>Mo tianluo said indifferently. He shot up into the sky and struck out with his palm..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
