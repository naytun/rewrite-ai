The space storm swept in all directions and he was almost caught in it.</p><p>Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron! Hide in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron!</p><p>Lu Ming thought of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. With a single thought, a Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron appeared in front of him and he rushed into it.</p><p>The energy of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron seemed to have been exhausted and it had fallen into a deep sleep. Lu Ming could not activate the terrifying power.</p><p>However, the material of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was extremely hard. Now, he could only rely on the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron to resist the spatial storm outside.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>Lu Ming had just hidden in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron when it was swept up by a spatial storm.</p><p>The terrifying spatial storm burst forth with astonishing power, constantly cutting the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>However, the material of the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was extremely hard. Although the spatial storm was powerful, it could not do anything to the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>The leader of the LAN family also saw this scene.</p><p>“Save me, Lu Ming, save me!”</p><p>The leader of the LAN family yelled.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s faint voice was heard from the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>no, save me. You can’t leave us in the lurch. We’re all from the heaven realm …</p><p>The leader of the LAN family shouted and wanted to rush toward the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>However, at this moment, the entire world seemed to have collapsed. Endless spatial storms swept out. The leader of the LAN family was directly swept into the spatial storm. He let out a desperate scream and then there was no sound.</p><p>Outside the small world, the other members of the LAN family and the Yan family were about to rush into the small world as well. However, as soon as they approached the vortex, the vortex shook violently and exploded.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The LAN and Yan families were shocked.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Following that, the entire space trembled violently. The LAN and Yan families were shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>The people from the other heaven realms also came over and looked on in surprise.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>A crack had actually appeared where the whirlpool had originally been, and one could vaguely see the scene of destruction inside.</p><p>“This is … The small world has collapsed, that small world has collapsed!”</p><p>Everyone was an experienced person. How could they not have thought of this when they saw this scene?</p><p>They also speculated that the small world must have been too ancient, and now it was completely collapsing.</p><p>“Lu Ming is dead!”</p><p>Someone said in a low voice.</p><p>Everyone’s expression was grave. Facing the collapse of a small world, the true Emperor realm expert was most likely dead.</p><p>The LAN and Yan families felt a wave of fear.</p><p>It was a good thing they didn’t rush in, or they would have died as well.</p><p>“It’s a pity about the indestructible ancient scroll!”</p><p>The LAN family and Yan family sighed in their hearts.</p><p>They did not care whether Lu Ming lived or died. It was a pity that the indestructible ancient scroll would be buried in the void with Lu Ming forever.</p><p>They didn’t leave, but watched from a distance.</p><p>At this time, the small world had completely collapsed, and the endless space storm swept over the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was hiding in the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and was protected by it, the power formed by the terrifying vibration still seeped into the divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron. Lu Ming suffered a terrifying attack.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by the power of law.</p><p>At the same time, he activated the imperishable golden body to resist the terrifying power. However, he was still heavily injured. His bones were broken and his muscles were torn apart. He spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>This small world was definitely the small world of a heavenly Emperor realm powerhouse. The energy formed from the collapse was too terrifying.</p><p>The Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron was like a small boat in the boundless ocean, drifting with the current. It was swept into the boundless dark void by the spatial storm and drifted far away.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron suddenly let out a violent roar. Then, a violent explosion erupted outside. Then, everything calmed down.</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it have been swept out of the dark void?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Through the opening of the divine cauldron, he noticed a ray of light shining in.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It seemed that he had really left the dark void.</p><p>Lu Ming crawled out of the cauldron.</p><p>In the outside world, birds were chirping and flowers were blooming. He was currently on this mountain peak.</p><p>However, when the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron smashed down just now, half of the mountain was crushed and embedded in the mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron away.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around.</p><p>What came into view was an endless Green Mountain, verdant and lush, full of vitality.</p><p>This wasn’t the battlefield of true emperors at all. In fact, it wasn’t even the battlefield outside two world city.</p><p>Because of the constant battles on the battlefield, it had long been deathly silent, and no vegetation could survive.</p><p>It was completely different from this place.</p><p>could I have been sucked into a spatial storm somewhere in the Tai Qing heavenly region?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart. However, his heart skipped a beat at the next moment. He thought of another possibility.</p><p>If they could be swept into the Tai Qing heavenly region, wouldn’t they be swept into other heavenly regions as well?</p><p>Could this place be another heaven domain?</p><p>Of the nine heaven domains in the heaven realm, except for the Tai Qing heaven domain, the other eight heaven domains were all occupied by the alien races. It would be troublesome if they went to the other heaven domains.</p><p>“Let’s heal first!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He was severely injured. No matter where he was, he had to heal his injuries first and adjust his condition to the peak. That was the best way.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated the indestructible ancient scroll to begin healing his injuries.</p><p>However, he had just started to recuperate when streaks of rainbow light flew over at high speed from the distance. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he had no choice but to stop recuperating and look at the Rainbow light.</p><p>“An alien!”</p><p>At one glance, Lu Ming’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>There couldn’t be any foreign races in the Tai Qing heavenly region, and this wasn’t the battlefield outside the two world city, so there was only one possibility.</p><p>This was another heavenly domain in the heavenly realm.</p><p>Lu Ming felt bitter. He did not expect that he would really come to another heaven domain in the heaven realm.</p><p>it’s the human race! Kill all the humans who have escaped!</p><p>The alien races also saw Lu Ming and charged toward him.</p><p>Beams of destructive light were shooting toward Lu Ming from a distance.</p><p>“The strongest is only a tenth level true Emperor. Kill!”</p><p>From the other party’s attack, Lu Ming could sense that the strongest alien race was a tenth level true Emperor.</p><p>Such combat strength was not a threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about his injuries. He condensed the infinite Dragon Spear in his hand and charged forward.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>One after another, the spear radiance pierced toward the foreign tribe members, killing them one by one.</p><p>More than ten alien races were killed by Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>After storing more than ten alien corpses into his small world, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he left the place.</p><p>He could not stay here for long. Lu Ming had to find a hidden place to recuperate.</p><p>His injuries had worsened after he forcefully attacked just now.</p><p>But the next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>Because another group of alien races was also coming from another direction.</p><p>it’s a human that escaped the net. Kill him!</p><p>Dozens of the alien races rushed toward Lu Ming..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
