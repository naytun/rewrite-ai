The other party has one rank 18 true Emperor and two rank 17 true emperors. However, we have one rank 18 true Emperor and three rank 17 true emperors. It’s enough to suppress them!</p><p>A white-haired old man said.</p><p>This white-haired elder was the strongest among them. He was a level 18 true Emperor, which was already at the peak.</p><p>In addition, there were three rank-17 powerhouses among them.</p><p>let’s make our move later. 1’11 deal with the opponent with a rank 18 true Emperor battle strength. We’ll also have to block the other two with rank 17 true Emperor battle strength. We’ll have one more rank 17 true Emperor battle strength to assist the others and kill the other alien races. Then, we’ll work together to kill the three strongest people on the other side!</p><p>The white-haired old man explained the strategy.</p><p>Everyone nodded. This strategy was the best one at the moment.</p><p>However, to be on the safe side, they didn’t make a move immediately. Instead, they waited for a while to prevent the other party from returning.</p><p>After a few hours, they would make their move after confirming that the Emperor had really left.</p><p>They concealed their auras and rushed toward the mine from the forest.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived near the mine.</p><p>There were two outsiders guarding the mine. They were both in the true Emperor realm but their combat strength was not high. They were killed by the white-haired elder in one move.</p><p>“Charge in!”</p><p>The white-haired old man growled, and they rushed into the mine.</p><p>“It’s a fish that escaped the net from the heaven realm, kill!”</p><p>As soon as they rushed in, they were discovered by the alien races. They roared like thunder and dozens of alien races rushed out from all over the mine.</p><p>There were more than fifty of them, double their numbers.</p><p>“Kill! Ants from the heaven realm, die!”</p><p>A purple-colored alien exuded a terrifying aura as he charged toward them.</p><p>This was a rank 18 true Emperor powerhouse.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>The white-haired old man rushed over and began to fight with this person.</p><p>The two of them had similar combat strength, and it was difficult to tell who was stronger.</p><p>At the same time, the two rank 17 true emperors from the foreign race were also blocked by the two from their side.</p><p>On their side, there was an additional level 17 true Emperor.</p><p>Although they had fewer people, they were all elites, and their combat strength was obviously stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed over. A long spear condensed in his hand. With a thrust of the spear, an alien race member with the combat power of a rank 13 true Emperor was killed.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that among these alien races, only a few of them had purple scales. Most of them were ordinary evil god races with black scales.</p><p>This was normal. The purple-scaled evil god tribe was a noble of the evil god tribe, so they naturally didn’t have that many.</p><p>They could only see so much outside the battlefield of two world city.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s bravery was unrivaled. After killing two alien races in a row, he was finally targeted by an alien race powerhouse.</p><p>This person was an existence with the battle power of a rank 15 true Emperor.</p><p>The alien roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The six-feathered wings on Lu Ming’s back flapped and he charged at the alien as well.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them used their killing moves and clashed together.</p><p>Then, the two of them quickly retreated.</p><p>The difference was that the other party spat out a large mouthful of blood and a large hole was blasted in his body. He was severely injured, while Lu Ming only suffered light injuries.</p><p>They were of the same combat strength, but Lu Ming had the indestructible golden body and shocking defensive power. The other party’s attack could only cause him minor injuries, while he could easily injure the other party.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack the man. The two of them exchanged a few more moves, and the man died on the spot after his head was pierced by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>Lu Ming had the absolute advantage in terms of combat strength.</p><p>Of course, having the same combat strength did not mean that they were of the same cultivation realm. In fact, the other party’s cultivation realm was much higher than Lu Ming’s. However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong and he could fight above his level. Hence, his combat strength was the same.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s team had an absolute advantage.</p><p>They were all elites with powerful combat strength. Although the other side had more people, their combat strength was not as strong as theirs. At this moment, more than 20 people had been killed.</p><p>Especially that rank 17 true Emperor expert, he was unrivaled and killed everyone.</p><p>They were about to achieve victory according to their plan.</p><p>Right at this moment, a loud boom was heard from one of the mines. Then, two burly foreign beings rushed out.</p><p>“Damn remnants of the heavenly realm, kill!”</p><p>The two demonic humans bellowed in rage. They soared into the sky and charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>“All!”</p><p>On Lu Ming’s side, two powerhouses were sent flying. One of them spat out a large mouthful of blood while the other one, who was slightly weaker, was killed immediately.</p><p>not good, there are two level 17 true Emperor experts. They were in the depths of the mine. There were no plants, so I couldn’t find them!</p><p>Ren Chan exclaimed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>The other side had two more rank 17 true emperors. This way, their high-end combat power was at a disadvantage and they were about to lose.</p><p>“Heaven realm’s remnant, die!”</p><p>The two alien races roared and charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I’ll block them!”</p><p>The rank-17 true Emperor expert charged toward the two foreign races.</p><p>However, he was fighting one against two and was not a match for them at all. After a few moves, he was injured.</p><p>This wasn’t a match in cultivation level, but a match in battle prowess. If one’s battle prowess was equal, then they would be evenly matched. It would be difficult to determine who was stronger. It would be one against two, so naturally, one would be no match.</p><p>“What do we do, what do we do?”</p><p>Ren Chan and the others were extremely anxious.</p><p>Their small worlds didn’t have many people to begin with, and they didn’t have many experts either. The death of even one was a huge loss.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said. He rushed over and the fallen star bow appeared in his hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming pulled the bowstring and the fallen star bow trembled slightly. The power of the law and the power of the world poured into the fallen star bow madly. A nine-colored arrow was shot at one of the rank 17 true Emperor alien race.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The alien waved his axe and chopped at the arrow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, the alien’s battle axe shook and cracks appeared on it. The alien couldn’t hold the battle axe and it flew out of his hand. He was also sent flying backward and spat out blood. He was severely injured.</p><p>Before Lu Ming’s chaos law had a breakthrough, his combat strength was at the level of a rank 14 true Emperor. When he used the fallen star bow, he would be blocked by a rank 17 true Emperor.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming had made a breakthrough in his chaos laws, the power of the fallen star bow had increased by a large margin. A rank-17 true Emperor could not withstand it at all and was severely injured by Lu Ming’s arrow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shot another arrow at the heavily injured alien.</p><p>This time, the other party could no longer resist and was shot to death in the air by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ren Chan and the others were ecstatic..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
