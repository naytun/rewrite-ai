It was too shocking. He had rushed to the two-star void Emperor realm as soon as he broke through.</p><p>When an ordinary person first became a void Emperor, they would only be at the initial stage of a one-star void Emperor and would need time to consolidate. Even if they were a top heaven’s pride expert with good resources and assistance, it would still take one or two years to break through to a two-star void Emperor.</p><p>For ordinary people, it would take even longer. However, Lu Ming had just broken through and he had already reached the level of a two-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>However, this was not the end. Lu Ming’s aura was still rising.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s aura had reached the peak of a two-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, our battle is not over yet. Let’s continue!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out as ou yabing stepped through the air. He formed a seal with his hands and a giant Pagoda and a giant flower vase appeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The pagoda was as big as a mountain, and it pressed down on Lu Ming. From the mouth of the flower vase, endless sword Qi burst out, sharp beyond compare.</p><p>“Despicable!”</p><p>“How shameless!”</p><p>Mu Lan and bubbles shouted.</p><p>Ou yabing had deliberately chosen this moment to make his move. He wanted to interrupt Lu Ming’s breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming had become a divine Emperor with nine types of laws, which was unprecedented in history. He had even gone through nine levels of Thunder tribulation and was at the peak of his momentum, about to break through continuously.</p><p>However, if he was interrupted, he would have to waste a lot of time if he wanted to break through again.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly shouted loudly, and the sound waves rolled.</p><p>At the same time, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he swept it horizontally.</p><p>This spear contained nine types of nomological laws. It was extremely powerful and swept in all directions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant Pagoda was swept by the long spear and exploded.</p><p>At the same time, the endless sword Qi also crumbled and turned into nothingness.</p><p>The long spear did not stop as it continued to blast towards ou Yeming.</p><p>Ou yabing’s expression changed drastically as he roared,”Divine weapon seal technique!”</p><p>He quickly formed seals with his hands, and in front of him, weapons were formed.</p><p>This was a terrifying Divine Art. It used the laws and the power of the world to interweave into divine weapons with infinite power.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s long spear swept over, these divine weapons all exploded and turned into nothingness.</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>Ou yabing’s expression changed drastically as he frantically retreated. However, it was already too late.</p><p>The terrifying power of the long spear pierced through the void and shattered the space. The terrifying power struck ou yabing’s body. He screamed out in pain as his body was sent flying tens of thousands of meters away. He then fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>The lower half of his body had completely exploded, leaving only the upper half of his body intact. He was spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>His aura was extremely weak.</p><p>He took out a large number of medicinal pills and stuffed them into his mouth, trying his best to recover his damaged body.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He did not bother with ou yabing anymore and continued to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Just now, he had already shown mercy. Otherwise, he would have been able to kill ou Yeming with a single move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was getting stronger and stronger. Ou yabing did not disturb him at all.</p><p>At this time, he had already reached the peak of a two-star illusionary Emperor. In the next moment, a violent roar came from Lu Ming’s body, and his aura suddenly soared.</p><p>The blood Qi was like a smoke signal that shot up into the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s dantian was undergoing a huge change.</p><p>His previous Saint heart had completely changed.</p><p>Countless nomological law threads covered every corner of the Saint heart, making it evolve into a small world.</p><p>The turbid air dropped while the clear air rose. The earth could be vaguely seen forming.</p><p>However, it was impossible for any living beings to survive now, because the small world was extremely unstable. The void was chaotic, and the space was extremely unstable.</p><p>This meant that the small world of the empty Emperor realm had not yet taken shape.</p><p>However, as his cultivation level increased, the pocket World would become more and more stable, and the area of the pocket World would also become larger.</p><p>In the end, when one reached the true Emperor realm, the small world would be completely stable and living beings could live inside.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cultivation had already reached the three-star illusionary Emperor stage.</p><p>in one breath, he has rushed to the three-star illusionary Emperor stage. This is too shocking!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>This speed was too fast.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The Galaxy roared in anger. It was extremely unwilling and filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>Back then, during the battle of the ten lands, he had entered the world left behind by the opening of that corner of the primordial realm and had broken through to become a one-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>Later on, he came to the heaven realm. With the guidance of a famous teacher and a lot of resources, it took him more than five years to reach the three-star illusionary Emperor stage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was different. As soon as he became an Emperor, he immediately became a three-star illusionary Emperor.</p><p>It would be strange if he wasn’t jealous.</p><p>Lu Ming’s breakthrough had not stopped. After reaching the three-star illusionary Emperor stage, he was still rising and slowly approaching the peak of the three-star illusionary Emperor stage.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming had accumulated a lot of experience before he became a great emperor.</p><p>His Saint power had been refined nine times by nine different laws and had become extremely condensed and strong. So was his Saint heart, which was crystal clear and bright.</p><p>The quantitative change led to a qualitative change. His Saint power was no weaker than the world power.</p><p>Now that he had made a breakthrough, his cultivation naturally increased rapidly.</p><p>It was only when he reached the peak of the three-star illusionary Emperor stage that Lu Ming’s rising momentum slowed down. His accumulation was finally about to be exhausted.</p><p>“In one go, I’ll rush to the four-star void Emperor stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Three streams of air suddenly appeared in his hands.</p><p>“That’s the nebulous primordial chaos!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>That’s right. The three streams of air in Lu Ming’s hands were the primordial Qi that he had obtained through the Hunyuan sect’s assessment.</p><p>The nebulous primordial chaos was similar to the nebulous chaos. It was born at the beginning of the world and could be refined to condense a small world. It could increase the power of the world and impact one’s realm.</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath. Three wisps of primordial Qi were inhaled through his nose and then surged toward his dantian, entering the small world.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the power of the world with all his might and began to refine three wisps of primordial Qi.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The nebulous primordial chaos was as heavy as a mountain. It was constantly being refined and turned into a part of Lu Ming’s small world.</p><p>The area of Lu Ming’s small world began to expand rapidly. At the same time, it also became more stable.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura, which had already stopped, rose sharply again. When Lu Ming’s aura reached a peak, it was as if he had broken through a certain zero point. His aura rose to another height.</p><p>A four-star illusionary Emperor!</p><p>Many people looked at each other and were completely speechless.</p><p>He had just become a void Emperor, but he had already reached the four-star void Emperor realm in one fell swoop. This speed was simply terrifying. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it even if he was beaten to death.</p><p>“Freak, freak!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming is so powerful!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out, his large eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>this kid is indeed worthy of being someone that this Lord values. He has some of this Lord’s style!</p><p>Dandan also smiled widely.</p><p>In contrast, LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, and Yuan Xin all looked extremely pale, and their eyes were filled with fear..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
