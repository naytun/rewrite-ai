Behind them was a string of evil god tribe powerhouses.</p><p>The three groups of people were all very fast, and in the blink of an eye, they had crossed a large forest.</p><p>The commotion here finally attracted the attention of others, and a group of people flew over.</p><p>It was the other people from the heaven realm. When they saw the evil god race, they started charging over.</p><p>When the evil god race saw that the heaven realm experts had increased in number, they did not dare to give chase anymore. They turned around and ran. “What a pity!”</p><p>Dandan sighed unceasingly. It was truly a pity that they didn’t cause LAN Yun and the others any losses this time.</p><p>“You guys … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, LAN Yun was extremely furious. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he led his men and charged towards Lu Ming and dandan.</p><p>“What do you want? You want to attack your own people on the battlefield?”</p><p>Dandan immediately shouted.</p><p>you’ve brought the evil god tribe’s people to charge at us time and time again. 1 suspect that you’re doing this on purpose. You’re trying to frame us.</p><p>LAN Yun said coldly.</p><p>Bullsh * t! Daddy here has a grudge with the evil god race. When I saw the evil god race, 1 didn’t want to let them off. That was why 1 went to kill them. However, there were simply too many of them, so we could only run. To think that we would meet you guys twice! This shows that we are fated!</p><p>Dandan began to lie through her teeth and talk nonsense.</p><p>However, the other party could not refute this reason.</p><p>Was it wrong to kill the evil god race?</p><p>Was it wrong to run away when you couldn’t win?</p><p>It just so happened to run to LAN Yun’s side, so they could only blame their bad luck.</p><p>“You… You…”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others were tongue-tied and speechless.</p><p>They were so angry that they almost vomited blood. Their eyes were wide and round. They could not wait to cut Lu Ming and dandan into pieces. However, now that there were other people from the heaven realm, it was not appropriate for them to do so.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>In the end, LAN Yun and the others were helpless and could only bring their people and leave this place.</p><p>it seems like this trick won’t work. These guys have learned their lesson!</p><p>After muttering to himself, the two of them moved forward and began to search the area.</p><p>“Look, there’s something unusual over there!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming looked ahead.</p><p>There, he could vaguely see a red light jumping around. It was unusually bright and dyed Half the Sky red, like fresh blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Obviously, the others had also noticed the abnormality and flew in that direction.</p><p>red light is everywhere. There’s a treasure. Let’s go!</p><p>Dandan’s eyes were burning, and the two of them also flew towards that area.</p><p>From other directions, there were also streaks of rainbow light flying over.</p><p>This was the direction that the heaven realm’s experts were searching in. Hence, no experts from the evil god tribe were rushing over.</p><p>In front of them, there was a huge and majestic mountain. On one side of the mountain, there was a cliff that was thousands of meters high. The red light was coming from the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>Everyone flew to the bottom of the cliff and found a pool there. The pool was not filled with water, but a bright red liquid, like fresh blood.</p><p>In the pool, there was a figure sitting cross-legged, covered in a bright red liquid, but his appearance could still be seen.</p><p>A beautiful woman!</p><p>Mu Lan!</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He had never expected to meet Mu Lan here.</p><p>Mu Lan was either cultivating or receiving some kind of inheritance. A small blood-red Pagoda was suspended above her head, exuding a vast pressure. It was high and mighty, like the might of the heavens.</p><p>Without a doubt, this small Pagoda was definitely a Supreme treasure.</p><p>“Treasure, this is definitely a treasure!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning with greed.</p><p>It was the same for dandan. She was almost drooling as she stared at the small tower.</p><p>this is the treasure of a powerful existence!</p><p>Dandan muttered, her eyes shining.</p><p>“She’s my friend!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly sent a voice transmission to dandan, causing her face to fall.</p><p>However, at this moment, LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others could no longer hold back.</p><p>“This treasure is mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>One figure after another rushed out toward Mu Lan, trying to grab the blood-red Tower above her head.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily. He wanted to save her but it was too late.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a sword rang.</p><p>On the cliff behind the blood pool, there was a cave. The sound of the sword came from the cave. Then, a sword light flew out of the cave at an amazing speed, like a ray of light.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A few of them with low cultivation were directly cut in half by the sword light and died on the spot.</p><p>The others were also blocked by the sword light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared beside Mu Lan with a crystal-clear longsword floating above his head.</p><p>“Jian feiliu!”</p><p>Lu Ming was once again dumbfounded.</p><p>The person who appeared next to Mu Lan was a young man with dashing eyebrows and heroic eyes. He was extremely handsome. It was Jian feiliu, whom Lu Ming had not seen for many years.</p><p>Back when Lu Ming was wandering in ninedragons, Jian feiliu was severely injured by the Wang family and the other families ‘geniuses. His cultivation was crippled. Later, he entered the blood pool and was taken away by a mysterious person under the blood pool. It was suspected that he was the remnant soul of an expert.</p><p>It had been many years since they last met. He didn’t expect Jian feiliu to still be alive. Not only could he cultivate, but his cultivation had also reached an amazing level. The people he had just killed were all martial sovereigns.</p><p>“Treasure, another treasure!”</p><p>Dandan looked at the long sword above Jian feiliu’s head with shining eyes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The longsword trembled slightly and emitted a fluorescent light. A terrifying sword Qi whistled and shot into the sky.</p><p>This was definitely a peerless sword. It was mostly thanks to this sword that Jian feiliu was able to block so many experts with one sword.</p><p>The others were also staring at the long sword above Jian feiliu’s head with burning eyes.</p><p>“Brat, Who are you? how dare you kill our people? people of heaven realm can’t kill each other on the battlefield. Kneel down and surrender!”</p><p>LAN Yun shouted.</p><p>“I’m not from two world city!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said coldly,” moreover, you were the ones who wanted to attack me without any explanation. Can’t you see that my friend is currently accepting the inheritance?”</p><p>“He’s still trying to quibble after killing someone. Take him down!”</p><p>LAN Yun roared. His eyes were burning with fire as he kept turning the longsword above Jian feiliu’s head and the small tower above Mu Lan’s head.</p><p>This was definitely a rare treasure, a treasure left behind by an ancient powerhouse.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming roared loudly.</p><p>Everyone stopped and Lu Ming dashed out.</p><p>“It’s you. What do you want to do?”</p><p>After LAN Yun saw Lu Ming, a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming and dandan had brought the evil god tribe to their place and caused them to suffer heavy losses. He had been thinking about it.</p><p>“Dandan, quickly set up the formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming first sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>Dandan nodded and sneakily walked around. With every step she took, countless runes sank into the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across LAN Yun and the rest. Then, he pointed at Jian feiliu and Mu Lan and sneered. I can tell that these two are humans. They are our people.. It’s too much for you to steal the treasures of your own people!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
