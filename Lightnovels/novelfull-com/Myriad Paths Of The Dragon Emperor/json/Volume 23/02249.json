Countless bolts of lightning slithered through the dark clouds like silver Snakes. A powerful pressure spread out and the entire world was instantly filled with an oppressive aura.</p><p>tribulation clouds! It’s the Tribulation clouds!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“How is that possible? How could there be tribulation clouds? Could it be that Lu Ming is about to break through!”</p><p>“Didn’t you say you can’t break through? Those below the rank of martial Supreme can control many laws and can’t break through. Why would there be tribulation clouds?”</p><p>People kept shouting in shock.</p><p>The appearance of the Tribulation cloud indicated that a Great Tribulation of heaven and earth was coming. This was the emperor’s tribulation. As long as one could pass the emperor’s tribulation, one would be able to step into the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>However, didn’t lu Ming, who was below the rank of a martial Supreme, master many types of laws and find it difficult to become a martial Supreme?</p><p>Everyone, including the celestial Thearch, thought that it was impossible for Lu Ming to break through. If he were to break through by force, the power triggered by the different laws would tear his Saint heart and physical body apart, and he would die on the spot.</p><p>Throughout history, no one had ever been able to trigger a Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation would only appear when heaven and earth sensed that a new martial sovereign was about to be born.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming had already surpassed all the ancient people and was ahead of them. He had created a miracle.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, Heng Xinghe, Yuan Xin, and the others roared madly. They could not believe what they had just seen.</p><p>Not only them, but the LAN clan’s celestial Thearch, the Yan clan’s celestial Thearch, and the star river’s master were all in disbelief. They were flabbergasted, and their faces darkened.</p><p>“Hahaha, good!”</p><p>Heavenly Emperor Heng Yu laughed heartily.</p><p>On the other hand, Mu Lan, Gu yingchong, bubbles, and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>“I knew it, this kid can do it!”</p><p>Dandan whispered.</p><p>could he really create a miracle and break through to the Martial Emperor realm?”</p><p>The other heavenly emperors of the heaven realm spoke up, filled with anticipation.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, it would definitely be a miracle if he managed to break through to the martial Supreme realm. His future achievements would be hard to estimate.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled. In the sky, more and more dark clouds gathered and became thicker and thicker. In the blink of an eye, the area covered by the Tribulation clouds had exceeded a hundred li. However, it did not stop and continued to expand rapidly.</p><p>Two hundred miles, three hundred miles …</p><p>Very quickly, it reached a thousand miles. However, the range of the Tribulation cloud did not stop. It was still rapidly expanding.</p><p>Two thousand miles, three thousand miles …</p><p>Ten thousand miles, twenty thousand miles …</p><p>Soon, the Tribulation cloud’s range had reached an astonishing size of tens of thousands of miles. The sky and earth had turned pitch-black, completely blocking the sunlight. Even a corner of yaoguang ancient city had been covered by the Tribulation cloud.</p><p>The oppressive and terrifying pressure made one’s heart tremble.</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The four groups of people frantically retreated, not daring to be enveloped by the Tribulation clouds.</p><p>This was not a joke. Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud had covered a radius of tens of thousands of miles. It was too terrifying. Once one was enveloped by it, one would trigger a Great Tribulation.</p><p>This was especially true for the Martial Emperor realm Warriors. Every 33333 years, they would face another tribulation. However, if they entered someone else’s tribulation cloud, their tribulation would be triggered in advance. They were not prepared for it and it was very dangerous.</p><p>Even the celestial Thearch had to back away from the area.</p><p>Although the heavenly Emperor no longer had a tribulation, who knew what would happen if he entered the area where others were undergoing tribulation? if he really attracted a Heavenly Tribulation, the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>Everyone retreated. Many people within the ancient city of Alkaid also retreated.</p><p>However, it was far from over. Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud was still growing.</p><p>50,000 miles, 60000 miles … Finally, it stopped when it reached a radius of 100000 miles.</p><p>The surrounding people retreated again and again.</p><p>“Heavens, a Heavenly Tribulation within a radius of a hundred thousand miles, this … This is too terrifying!”</p><p>“How powerful is this Heavenly Tribulation?”</p><p>“The more heaven-defying a person is, the more terrifying the heavenly Tribulation will be!”</p><p>Many people widened their mouths in shock. They knew that Lu Ming was too heaven-defying.</p><p>He had not even become a sovereign, but he had already mastered nine laws, including three ultimate laws. This was something that no one in history had ever been able to do.</p><p>That was why his Heavenly Tribulation was so abnormal.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming’s martial Royal ordeal only had a radius of two hundred miles.</p><p>When an ordinary person underwent a sovereign tribulation, the range of the Tribulation cloud was usually only about a thousand miles. However, Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud was indeed a hundred thousand miles.</p><p>such a powerful Heavenly Tribulation. Let’s see how you survive it. Die under the heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>LAN Yun, Yan Xi, and the others prayed silently.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Tribulation clouds were too terrifying. The sky and earth were covered in darkness, blocking the sunlight.</p><p>In the clouds, endless silver lightning was swimming. There were also giant Dragons roaring endlessly. It was very depressing.</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but retreat. Under the Tribulation cloud, they felt that their breathing was not smooth. There was a great horror that made them go crazy.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, Lu Ming was the only one standing under the vast tribulation clouds, looking up at the sky.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>There was no fear in Lu Ming’s eyes. There was only anticipation.</p><p>As long as he went through the heavenly Tribulation, he would be able to break through and become an Emperor. From then on, he would step into the last realm of martial Dao.</p><p>This was a realm that all cultivators dreamed of.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning struck down like a divine sword. It tore the space apart and struck Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. He did not block the lightning and allowed it to strike his body.</p><p>This was only the first wave of the lightning punishment. If Lu Ming had to put in a lot of effort to resist this lightning punishment, then there was no need to play with the rest.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The lightning struck Lu Ming and dissipated immediately. Lu Ming did not feel anything.</p><p>too weak. Let’s try again!</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky and muttered.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Then, bolts of lightning struck Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood still in the void, resisting it with his physical strength.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds rolled continuously. Thunder boomed, making people’s hearts beat faster.</p><p>Following that, bolts of lightning struck down from the dark clouds and struck at Lu Ming.</p><p>The lightning this time was darker in color than the previous ones.</p><p>The second lightning tribulation had descended.</p><p>Lu Ming was still using his physical body to resist.</p><p>it’s not enough! It’s not powerful enough!</p><p>As the lightning struck, Lu Ming’s body only felt a little numb. He wanted to use the lightning tribulation to temper his body, but the lightning tribulation only had a slight effect.</p><p>Not long after, the second lightning punishment passed, but the third lightning punishment descended.</p><p>The third lightning punishment was a purple fire lightning punishment. The lightning was covered with a layer of fire.</p><p>It was several times more powerful than the second lightning tribulation.</p><p>When Lu Ming was going through the martial Royal ordeal, he had also experienced the third stage of the purple fire Thunder tribulation. However, he was going through the sovereign ordeal now. Therefore, although it was the same kind of Thunder tribulation, the power was thousands of miles apart.</p><p>The lightning tribulation now could turn Lu Ming into ashes with just a strand of hair..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
