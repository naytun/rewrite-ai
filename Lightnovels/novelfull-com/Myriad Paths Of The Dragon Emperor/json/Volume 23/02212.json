They can only hold back a portion of the power and can’t play a crucial role. We still have to rely on evil swordsman!</p><p>Dandan sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Even though his current cultivation was far from what it had been in the ancient times, his vision was still there. He could determine his cultivation based on his aura.</p><p>“Surround and kill them!”</p><p>The experts of the evil god race roared. There were at least four or five of them, and they weren’t any weaker than the three experts from two world city. They surrounded evil swordsman.</p><p>According to dandan, they were all peak great emperor experts.</p><p>Evil swordsman’s demonic Qi became even more intense. Sword light crisscrossed as he fought with his opponent.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>After a few strikes, a peak Emperor was killed by evil swordsman.</p><p>Although evil swordsman had yet to recover from his injuries, his battle strength was still terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Evil swordsman let out a long cry, and sword light shot up into the sky. A sword light that was ten thousand Li Long was extremely terrifying.</p><p>As the sword slashed out, the void was completely shattered. A large number of evil god race members with weak cultivation bases were swept into the sword light and turned into ashes.</p><p>“Celestial Emperor, it’s the celestial Emperor!”</p><p>“How can the heavenly Emperor come here?”</p><p>furious roars came from the evil god race and they were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Too many peerless experts had died in this region in the past, leaving behind their immortal imprints. Once they sensed a powerful expert, these imprints would appear to kill the enemy.</p><p>This was especially true for the heavenly Emperor. Once he arrived in this territory, the marks of the experts would sense him and even leave his original place to attack him together and kill him.</p><p>In the past, there were also people of the heavenly Emperor realm who came here, but they all died.</p><p>Of course, the extremely terrifying heavenly emperors were the exception. Their strength was not weaker than those peerless experts when they were alive, and might even surpass them. With such strength, they would not be afraid even if those experts were alive, so why would they be afraid after they died?</p><p>However, evil swordsman’s battle strength didn’t seem to be that of a peerless expert, and was only equivalent to the most ordinary Celestial Emperor. How could he have entered this place?</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Evil swordsman continued to strike out with his sword, and every time he did so, a member of the evil god race would die under his sword. At the same time, the void continued to shatter, and the formation that the evil god race had set up was also continuously destroyed.</p><p>“Take out the celestial Thearch weapon!”</p><p>Some of the evil god race members roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Several terrifying fluctuations spread out in succession. Then, a giant axe, a mountain, and a saber appeared in the sky.</p><p>This was a Celestial Emperor weapon, a weapon controlled by a Celestial Emperor. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>The celestial Thearch himself could not enter, but the celestial Thearch weapon could be brought in.</p><p>The marks on the celestial Emperor weapon would not be able to sense it if it was not revived. Furthermore, it was just an inanimate object, not a living one. The marks would not have any reaction.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three Celestial Emperor weapons were awakened, and terrifying fluctuations burst forth from them. They gave off the aura of the heavenly Dao as they shot toward evil swordsman.</p><p>“If a Celestial Emperor weapon isn’t controlled by a Celestial Emperor, how much power can it unleash? 1’11 show you the true power of a Celestial Emperor weapon!”</p><p>Evil swordsman’s cold voice rang out, and the long sword in his hand burst out with a shocking sword howl.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword hummed as several terrifying sword lights slashed out from evil swordsman’s hands.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>After three consecutive clashes, the three celestial Thearch weapons of the evil god race trembled violently and were sent flying. The three powerful beings of the evil god race who were controlling the celestial Thearch weapons spat out mouthfuls of blood as their bodies cracked and exploded.</p><p>Without a doubt, the long sword in evil swordsman’s hand was also a celestial Thearch weapon. It was controlled by him, and its power was extremely powerful.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Right at this moment, an explosive roar came from the distance. An extremely terrifying aura rushed over.</p><p>Then, a huge demonic shadow appeared in the world.</p><p>The demonic shadow was huge, towering like a mountain. It stood between the heaven and earth and was approaching.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>the evil god race members were ecstatic.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils suddenly constricted and his gaze was extremely solemn.</p><p>When he had passed through that passage and come from the primordial realm, he had seen four huge demonic shadows fighting against the nine Divine Nine-Dragon cauldrons.</p><p>This demonic shadow was extremely similar to one of the previous four.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic shadow moved and threw a punch. The void was directly shattered, and the huge fist, wrapped in the void turbulence, smashed toward evil swordsman.</p><p>At this moment, evil swordsman’s eyes were extremely grave. The long sword in his hand kept shaking, and his aura was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the end, evil swordsman slashed out with his sword, and a shocking sword light slashed toward the huge fist.</p><p>The sword gleam collided with the fist, causing an ear-piercing cutting sound. Although he was still far away, Lu Ming could feel a sharp pain in his eardrums. The blood in his body was boiling, and his body felt like it was about to explode.</p><p>Dandan also circulated her energy to resist, but she was slightly better than Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, evil swordsman’s sword light shattered, and the remaining power of the fist blasted towards evil swordsman, forcing him to retreat frantically.</p><p>not good! Senior evil swordsman is no match for him!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was ugly.</p><p>that’s the old ancestor of the evil god race, a peerless expert. However, he should be injured as well, and his battle prowess is far from his peak!</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that the evil god tribe’s patriarch must have been injured during the intense battle with the Divine Nine-Dragon Cauldron and the huge true dragon in the sky.</p><p>you’re an ancient antique from the ancient times. Today, I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor spoke, and his voice caused the sky to rumble.</p><p>His body began to shrink, and he became three meters tall. His speed increased greatly, and he instantly approached evil swordsman.</p><p>This was also a purple-scaled being of the evil god race. He wasn’t a member of the Royal race, but a noble of the evil god race. However, his cultivation base had already reached a terrifying realm.</p><p>His palm was like a knife, and he struck out a few times towards evil swordsman.</p><p>Evil swordsman fought with him, but he was no match. After a few moves, evil swordsman was violently shaken and sent flying far away, a trace of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Although the evil god race’s old ancestor was also injured, his injuries weren’t as severe as evil swordsman’s.</p><p>In ancient times, evil swordsman had almost died in battle, and only a wisp of his soul remained.</p><p>After so many years, he had yet to recover, and his fighting prowess was far from what it had been at his peak.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The evil god race’s old master had the upper hand, and his attacks became even more violent.</p><p>“A junior, this old man will accompany you in battle!”</p><p>Blood trickled down from the corner of evil swordsman’s mouth, but his eyes were exceptionally bright. At this moment, a layer of light flickered on his body, burning like a flame.</p><p>At the same time, evil swordsman’s aura also soared.</p><p>“Evil swordsman, it’s time to go all out!”</p><p>Dandan opened her mouth and watched with rapt attention.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Evil swordsman slashed out with his sword, and a sword light that was several times more terrifying than the previous one slashed toward the evil god race’s old ancestor.</p><p>The evil god race’s old ancestor’s eyes also became serious. A battle-axe appeared in his hand, and he charged towards evil swordsman.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two experts exploded with terrifying rumbles as they engaged in a fierce battle. For a moment, it was difficult to determine the victor.</p><p>The two of them rushed into the depths of the sky and fought.</p><p>The rest of the evil god tribe charged towards the three experts of two world city. The three experts of two world city were in a precarious situation..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
