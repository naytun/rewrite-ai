In fact, he had used all his strength.</p><p>One had to know that these were all extremely powerful experts. In a battle of the same level, it was almost impossible to be killed in one move.</p><p>Each and every one of them was stronger than Qin Qingshan.</p><p>In order to create such an effect and intimidate Jiang Taixu and the others, the fatty had used all his strength. It had consumed a lot of his energy, and he could not maintain that terrifying combat strength for long.</p><p>But fortunately, Jiang Taixu and the others were really scared off.</p><p>Aiyo, I’m so tired. Fighting is really something that consumes a lot of energy. No, I have to quickly replenish my energy!</p><p>As he said that, a roasted Golden Lamb leg appeared in Kong Jin’s hand and he began to gnaw on it.</p><p>“Sister, we have to find Lu Ming’s brother-in-law as soon as possible and join forces with him. Jiang Taixu and his people will definitely not let this go.”</p><p>Kong Jin mumbled as he gnawed on a leg of lamb.</p><p>“I’m telling you, I’m not your sister. Lu Ming, he … He’s not your brother-in-law!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were wide open as he gritted his teeth.</p><p>Oh, look, you’re all shy. You and Lu Ming will be together sooner or later. So will your sister and I. Don’t worry!</p><p>Kong Jin said as he gnawed on the leg of lamb. The fat on his chubby body trembled. He was extremely confident.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth. He was speechless at this fatty and turned to leave.</p><p>“Brother Kong Jin, thank you for your help this time!”</p><p>Jian feiliu cupped his hands and said.</p><p>“What are you thanking me for? we’re all family. Haha, hey, sister, wait for me!”</p><p>Kong Jin twisted his fat body and chased after Xie nianqing.</p><p>Jian feiliu smiled bitterly. This Kong Jin was really weird.</p><p>The three of them searched for the others to seize the monument Qi while searching for Lu Ming.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and the others were also gathering the experts of the Jiang and Wang families. In addition, there were also people from the Luan family.</p><p>They also wanted to get the Dongfang family and the other two families involved, but the people of the two family heads were obviously not interested and did not agree.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was already the third day. There were still a few hours before the end of the three days.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know about all that.</p><p>These few days, he had been snatching the Qi of the stele.</p><p>Those he encountered, as long as they took the initiative to hand over the monument Qi, he would not make things difficult for them. If the other party refused to comply, he would not be soft-hearted.</p><p>As more and more people were eliminated, the remaining people gathered more and more Qi.</p><p>For every person he captured, he would obtain a large amount of stele Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming already had more than two thousand strands of stele Qi.</p><p>This time, there were more than ten thousand people who had entered. In total, there were more than thirty thousand strands of Qi.</p><p>He had obtained more than 2000, which was not a small number. It was almost certain that he would enter the top 50, or even more.</p><p>I haven’t seen anyone from the Jiang family and the Wang family in the past few days. Also, I haven’t seen Xiaoqing and the others either!</p><p>Lu Ming was in deep thought. He did not know if he was lucky or unlucky.</p><p>two thousand Qi is definitely not enough. There are still a few more hours before it’s time to leave. I’ll go and block the exit first and wait for the people from the Jiang and Wang clan to arrive. Then, I’ll snatch all their Qi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>He had the same idea as Jiang Taixu and the others.</p><p>Jiang Taixu and the rest gathered their men to ambush Lu Ming at the exit, while Lu Ming wanted to seize the stele Qi of the Jiang and Wang families at the exit.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming flew in the direction of the exit.</p><p>The exit of the Heavenly King tablet world was at the center of the world.</p><p>Once the three days are up, you have to leave through that exit. After three days, even if you kill someone, you won’t be able to seize the stele Qi.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As he got closer to the exit, he saw a few figures.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, there was still room to enter.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and flew up.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu’s eyes lit up.</p><p>They had been looking for Lu Ming for a long time but to no avail. Therefore, they wandered around the area near the exit, waiting for Lu Ming. As expected, they met him.</p><p>“Haha, younger brother-in-law, we’ve been looking for you for a long time!”</p><p>Kong Jin stepped forward and grinned.</p><p>“Younger brother-in-law?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look on his face. When did he become the Fatty’s brother-in-law?</p><p>“That’s right, she’s my wife’s sister, so you’re my brother-in-law!”</p><p>Kong Jin pointed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face darkened and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips trembled. This fatty was really a talent.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s cold and aloof figure appeared in Lu Ming’s mind. He was like a pure and holy fairy who was aloof and looked down on others.</p><p>If Xie nianjun knew that this fatty had taken her as his wife, what would his expression be like? Lu Ming did not know why, but he was looking forward to it.</p><p>“How have you been these past few days? Did you run into the Jiang family and the Wang family?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Both Jian feiliu and Xie nianqing’s faces turned dark.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You guys encountered it?” Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right, not only did we meet, we even had a big fight. If it wasn’t for brother Kong’s timely rescue, miss Xie and I would have been in danger.”</p><p>Jian feiliu sighed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you defeat Jiang Taixu?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Jiang Taixu joined forces with the Wang family and killed all the members of the golden sword sect. Now, he wants to capture us to threaten you! Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was enraged and a cold killing intent burst out from his body.</p><p>Xie nianqing briefly explained what had happened during this period of time.</p><p>“Jiang Taixu should be killed!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. He did not expect Jiang Taixu to be so despicable. He was no match for Lu Ming, but Jiang Taixu had gathered his men to kill the golden sword sect members and even wanted to capture Xie nianqing and the others to threaten Lu Ming.</p><p>Was this the pride of an ancient family?</p><p>“Then they must have gathered their men and are waiting for us at the exit. Good, very good. This time, I must kill Jiang Taixu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning, filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Brother Lu, they have more people. Are you confident?”</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>if there are too many people, then I’ll take them down one by one. Little Qing, I’ll need your cooperation later. Let’s go all out and clear the small fish first!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning.</p><p>haha, good, interesting, interesting. Watch me show off my power this time!</p><p>Kong Jin then took out a demon beast leg and gnawed on it in order to replenish his strength.</p><p>The four of them rested for a while, adjusting their condition to the peak, and then headed towards the exit.</p><p>At this moment, there were many people gathered at the exit.</p><p>Jiang Taixu had brought more than 30 experts of the Jiang family.</p><p>Wang Jue had also brought over 20 experts from the Wang family.</p><p>In addition, Luan Zhan was a proud Son of Heaven from the ancient Luan family. He was as famous as Jiang Taixu and the others, and he also brought more than 20 experts from the Luan family.</p><p>When the three parties gathered, there were close to eighty people.</p><p>This was a terrifying power. Every single one of them was a peak-tier King, and some of them could even compete for the top 108.</p><p>They were waiting for Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
