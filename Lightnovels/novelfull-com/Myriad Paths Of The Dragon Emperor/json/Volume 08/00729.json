The purple flames were too terrifying. Everywhere he passed, the space turned into a vacuum.</p><p>The Wang family was an ancient family. Their bloodline talent was of the fire type, which was extremely shocking.</p><p>This was especially true for the direct descendants of the Wang family. It was said that they could awaken a bloodline called the ultimate purple Heavenly Fire. This bloodline, when combined with a God-grade cultivation technique, the sky-burning Inferno, could unleash a terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to make a move. Jian feiliu had to face this matter himself. However, if Jian feiliu was in danger, he would not sit by and do nothing.</p><p>“Gold destruction slash!”</p><p>Jian feiliu growled. The dazzling golden light all over his body converged as if it was condensed into the sword in his hand. An extremely sharp feeling spread out from the sword.</p><p>Immediately, a dark golden sword light slashed towards Wang Mang.</p><p>a demigod-level martial technique!</p><p>Wang Mang’s pupils shrank as he let out a low roar. Immediately, the flames on his body rose sharply.</p><p>“Purple Extreme break!”</p><p>The purple halberd gushed out, causing the space to rumble.</p><p>A terrifying boom reverberated between heaven and earth. The dark golden sword light was shattered and Jian feiliu’s body was thrown far away. He coughed up blood in the air.</p><p>There were even purple flames on his body. They were burning fiercely as if they were going to burn Jian feiliu into ashes.</p><p>you have a demigod-level martial technique? what a pity that you didn’t cultivate it well. It’s someone else’s martial technique and not a bloodline martial technique. You want to stop me? die!</p><p>Wang Mang shouted as he strode forward and attacked Jian feiliu.</p><p>What he used was his own bloodline martial technique. Although he wasn’t at the demigod level, he was extremely close to it. With the combination of the God-level raging flames sky-burning technique and the extreme Purple Heavenly Fire bloodline, he defeated Jian feiliu’s attack in one fell swoop.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s demigod-level martial technique was obtained from the underground world’s holy mountain. He had only just started cultivating it, so it wasn’t very powerful. Naturally, he wasn’t Wang Mang’s match.</p><p>Jian feiliu has lost. Is he going to be killed by Wang Mang? ”</p><p>“The Wang clan is too powerful. Their bloodline is terrifying, and with the addition of a God-grade cultivation technique, who can defeat them? He was almost invincible in a battle of the same level. Jian feiliu was strong, but he couldn’t escape defeat!”</p><p>that’s right. All along, the top ten Heavenly Kings on the Heavenly King ranking were occupied by the six ancient families. The top spots on the Heavenly King ranking were also occupied by the geniuses from the six ancient families.</p><p>let’s not talk about the Heavenly King List. Even the top of the list of top 1000 talents are occupied by the six great ancient families. Only after the rise of the heavenly corpse sect did there be geniuses who could compete with the geniuses of the six great ancient families.</p><p>In the midst of everyone’s exclamations, Wang Mang’s halberd had already slashed towards Jian feiliu. It seemed that Jian feiliu’s defeat was already set in stone.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a vast fist radiance pierced through the void and headed toward Wang Mang.</p><p>“Who’s there? You dare to sneak attack me?”</p><p>Wang Mang shouted angrily. He changed the direction of his halberd and swung it at the fist radiance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud explosion, and Wang Mang’s body moved slightly, taking three steps back.</p><p>A slender figure stepped out and walked to Jian feiliu. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Jian, are you alright?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>brother Lu, I’m sorry to have embarrassed myself. This person is very strong. You have to be careful!</p><p>Jian feiliu had already put out the fire on his body and was gasping for breath.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and looked at Wang Mang, his eyes exuding a strong fighting spirit. God-grade cultivation technique, sky-burning flame technique. I’m going to have a taste of it today!</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>Wang Mang recognized Lu Ming and sneered, kid, don’t think that you can fight me just because you defeated a piece of trash ranked at the bottom of the list of top 1000 talents. If you want to experience the sky-burning flames, you better be prepared to be killed!</p><p>“With just you, I’m afraid you’re not as mature as everyone!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Although the cultivation technique was powerful, it also depended on who was cultivating it. It was not said that one would be powerful and invincible after cultivating a God-grade cultivation technique.</p><p>Take the true war Dragon technique as an example. If someone else were to cultivate it, they might not be able to cultivate to the highest realm and possess ten times the true energy.</p><p>The power would be different depending on who cultivated it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s meaning was clear. Wang Mang had not mastered it yet.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s eyes narrowed, and a cold killing intent flashed in them. He took a step forward and continued to charge at Lu Ming. He swung his halberd, burning everything in his path.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the explosive star fist and threw a punch. The fist ray contained two concepts of heaven and earth, Thunder and fire.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist radiance and the halberd collided, creating a violent boom.</p><p>“What a powerful force. It turns out that you’ve comprehended two wills. Unfortunately, it’s only level one, and you want to stop me? Kill!”</p><p>Wang Mang strode forward, his entire body seemingly turning into flames. It was as if a Purple Sun had appeared in the night sky.</p><p>There were more and more people in the surroundings. At this time, thousands of people had gathered and were watching carefully.</p><p>Most of the people were peak-tier Kings who had come to participate in the battle of the Heavenly King List.</p><p>He could use this opportunity to understand the combat strength of others and compare them with himself.</p><p>Some of them were even the top 700 on the list of top 1000 talents, and some of them were extremely powerful elders.</p><p>The intent realm that Wang Mang had comprehended was the flame intent realm. It was obvious that he had already reached level two.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then, add another one!”</p><p>The wind mentality also burst out. The three mentalities combined and exploded, pushing the power of the exploding star fist to the extreme.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, a beam of light filled the sky, illuminating the entire city.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move, but Wang Mang was retreating.</p><p>three intents? impossible!</p><p>A look of disbelief flashed across Wang Mang’s eyes. He had never thought that someone would be able to cultivate all three intents to such a level.</p><p>“Purple Extreme break!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s aura exploded as he performed his heaven level upper class bloodline martial technique. The purple flames seemed to be able to break through all obstacles.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, you’re not up to standard!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and the essential core in his body circulated wildly.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming did not use all his essential core.</p><p>If he were to use it now, he would completely crush anyone of the same level with his true essence.</p><p>The fist radiance of the exploding star fist was even more terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming threw dozens of punches in an instant. Each of his punches was like a shooting star, flying toward Wang Mang.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sound of explosions continued. After a few dozen explosions, Wang Mang’s figure retreated rapidly, blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p>He was injured and was completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it, attack and kill him!”</p><p>Wang Mang bellowed. As soon as he finished speaking, the two elders ‘figures flickered and they pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>These two elders were both peak-tier King tiers, but they had definitely lived for a very long time. Other than the fact that their heaven and earth intent realm hadn’t broken through to the second level yet, they were extremely terrifying in all other aspects. Their battle-power wasn’t much weaker than Wang Mang’s.</p><p>The two of them joined forces and suppressed Lu Ming.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. He took a step forward and struck out two palms in a row.</p><p>These two palms were ordinary, but they contained a terrifying force.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art!</p><p>With two dull sounds, the two old men retreated quickly, blood spurting from their mouths.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
