There was no way to compare them.</p><p>...</p><p>Those who had not awakened a divine bloodline would have limited future achievements.</p><p>Only those who had awakened a divine bloodline could be considered a divine level prodigy, and their future achievements would be limitless.</p><p>The top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents were all geniuses who had awakened divine bloodlines.</p><p>is this a divine bloodline? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with anticipation.</p><p>At this moment, long Qianli’s body seemed to have turned into a ray of light and rushed into his blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three-headed demon flood dragon actually opened its mouth, and its voice was exactly the same as long Qianli’s. It was as if the three-headed demon flood Dragon had come to life, and had transformed into a real three-headed demon flood Dragon.</p><p>Bloodline fusion!</p><p>It was said that those who had awakened a divine bloodline could perform bloodline fusion. Their bodies would merge with the bloodline and transform into the form of the bloodline, erupting with terrifying combat power.</p><p>The three-headed demon flood Dragon’s massive claws swiped toward Luan Fengyun and the others.</p><p>“Let’s join hands, let’s join hands!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun roared. His eyes were filled with shock as a powerful aura burst forth from his body. He drew his bow and instantly shot out nine arrows. They formed a line and shot towards the three-headed demon flood Dragon.</p><p>At the same time, Wang Haotian, Jiang Taiyou, and the rest also made their moves. They burst out together and attacked the three-headed demon snake one after another.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>First, the nine arrows were slapped away by the three-headed demon flood dragon’s claw. The huge claw continued to strike forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Luan Fengyun, Wang Haotian, and the others were all sent flying like cannonballs, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>With just one move, Luan Fengyun and the others were all injured. They looked at long Qianli in shock.</p><p>“You want to fight with me? You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The three-headed demon flood Dragon spoke in the human language before rapidly shrinking. In the next moment, it had returned to long Qianli’s appearance and was looking at Luan Fengyun and the others with a ferocious expression.</p><p>Crushing, completely crushing.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were all extremely shocked.</p><p>“Is this the power of a divine bloodline? The fusion of bloodlines is indeed powerful.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glimmered.</p><p>Long Qianli’s cultivation should be at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Although he was higher than Luan Fengyun and the others, it was difficult for ordinary heaven’s favorites to completely suppress him. However, long Qianli completely suppressed him. Moreover, no one knew how much strength he had used just now.</p><p>As one’s cultivation level increased, the power of the bloodline fusion would become even stronger.</p><p>“Do you all still want to continue fighting?”</p><p>Long Qianli’s gaze swept across Luan Fengyun and the others, causing their expressions to change.</p><p>long Qianli, the God-grade geniuses of our three families aren’t here today. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be afraid of you!</p><p>Luan Fengyun said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Nonsense. Now, get lost!”</p><p>Long Qianli said.</p><p>long Qianli, you can take away Lan Jin’s inheritor, but the others are ours!</p><p>Wang Haotian said. He still had not given up on the token on Lu Ming.</p><p>Long Qianli frowned. He swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest before finally landing on ruan Tingting. He said,”You’re Blue Gold Knight’s inheritor, right? Come with us!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his voice was clear.</p><p>“Eh? No? You want to stop me?”</p><p>Long Qianli’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“She’s my friend. If you want to take her away and extract the inheritance from her soul, you’ll have to get through me first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was extremely determined.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Unexpectedly, long Qianli burst into laughter and said, ” “So that’s what you’re worried about. You don’t have to worry about that. Do you think we’re as disgusting as the six great ancient families? We’ll bring her back, but we won’t strip her of her inheritance. Instead, we’ll nurture her and let her grow.”</p><p>“Oh? How can I trust you?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>this point is very simple. In history, this young lady wasn’t the only one who obtained the inheritance of an expert. In the end, those who joined the Emperor heaven Imperial Guards were all nurtured and some even became Supreme experts. No one was deprived of the inheritance. Who doesn’t know about this? ”</p><p>Long Qianli said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll go with them!”</p><p>“Di Tian’s Imperial Guards have indeed never deprived others of their inheritance before,” ruan Tingting said as she walked out of the cave.</p><p>Ruan Tingting knew very well that the best path for her now was to go to the Ditian royal guards. If she did not go, the six great ancient families would not give up and she would implicate Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were very clear about this.</p><p>“Young master long, I can go with you, but I have a condition!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“What condition?” Long Qianli said.</p><p>“I want them to leave this place with me. I’ll let you all leave after we leave the hundred venerated mountains!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting pointed at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“No, they must stay!”</p><p>Wang Haotian shouted.</p><p>“Is it your turn to speak?”</p><p>Long Qianli’s eyes darkened. He looked at Wang Haotian, who turned pale.</p><p>the few of you have protected your Friends to the End and fought against powerful enemies. I admire geniuses and heroes with true personalities the most. Even if you didn’t say anything, I would have done it. Alright, let’s go out together!</p><p>Long Qianli shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s leave this place together!” He said.</p><p>Ruan Tingting looked at Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. For now, it was better to leave this place first and then improve his cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the sword whistling Thunder formation disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Long Qianli took the lead, and Lu Ming and the rest followed him as they flew outside.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Haotian roared, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Hmph, inform the family. We can’t let these people off so easily!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun also said coldly.</p><p>They sent the news to their families.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest left the hundred venoms mountain very quickly and flew to the West.</p><p>The Wang family’s dragon vein was at the easternmost end, while the DI Tian Imperial Guards were at the center of ninedragons. They were at least ten million miles away from here.</p><p>After flying for a few hundred thousand miles, they stopped.</p><p>Tingting, we won’t send you off. Take care!</p><p>Kong Jin said reluctantly.</p><p>yeah, you guys too. I’ll go back to find you guys when I’m successful in my cultivation.</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Tingting, goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also bade farewell to ruan Tingting.</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at long Qianli and said, ” “Brother long, Lu Ming has something to ask. Is there any place in ninedragons that can replenish his blood essence?”</p><p>the blood pool is the most suitable place to replenish the power of the bloodline. It is a high-level cultivation Holy Land. You can accumulate the power of the bloodline in there and it will be of great help to awaken the third bloodline. However, you need a token to enter!</p><p>Long Qianli said.</p><p>“Blood pool!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this jade talisman is for you. It has records of some of the cultivation sanctuaries in ninedragons. There are ordinary ones and high-level ones. However, only those who are qualified can enter the high-level cultivation sanctuaries. You can take a look!”</p><p>Long Qianli threw a jade talisman to Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
