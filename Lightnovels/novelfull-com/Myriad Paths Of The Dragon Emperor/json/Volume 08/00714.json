It’s too early to say that I’m the chosen one. I don’t know how to wake your ancient ancestor up.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Don’t be so modest, Lu Ming. I have a feeling that you’re the only one who can awaken the ancient ancestor on this trip to the holy mountain. To be honest, if it weren’t for the fact that you’re from the outside world and have to return one day, and that you have such a beautiful girlfriend like miss Xie, I’d really like to keep you by my side and be my man!”</p><p>Red Moon blinked her big eyes and spoke very directly.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept coughing. He did not expect Red Moon to be so direct. Indeed, the humans in the underground were different from those outside.</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing blushed and said, ” “I’m not his confidante. Miss Chi Yue, why don’t you let him stay and be your man? this pervert will definitely be willing to do it!”</p><p>“Oh, really? Then I won’t be polite!”</p><p>Chi Yue chuckled, her gaze sweeping between Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Pervert, quickly agree!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s big eyes were fixed on Lu Ming. He emphasized every single word.</p><p>“Ah, haha, this wine is so good. Haha, the moon is so beautiful today.”</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a glass of wine, took a big gulp, and laughed awkwardly.</p><p>However, this was the underground world. Where did the moonlight come from?</p><p>……</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Chi Yue, Chi jinkong, Chi Jin mountain, and a few elders of the red leopard tribe gathered at the canyon where the previous chief of the red leopard tribe was sealed.</p><p>The Crimson blood sand and the poisonous snake blood mist were all ready. Now, they could break the last 36 sealing formations.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward. With a wave of his hand, a cloud of Crimson blood sand floated in the air. Then, he took out a Jade bottle that contained the blood mist of a venomous snake. He opened the bottle and the blood mist flew out, mixing with the Crimson blood sand.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s fingers moved rapidly in the air. He was so fast that afterimages appeared in the air.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Inscriptions attached to the Crimson blood sand and the poisonous snake’s blood mist flew into the Grand sealing formation.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and watched quietly. Chi jinkong and the others had a look of anticipation in their eyes.</p><p>However, there was one exception, and that was pure gold Mountain. His eyes were filled with anxiety, and his gaze flickered with uncertainty.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sealing formation glowed and a huge poisonous Rainbow Snake pounced out. However, the poisonous Rainbow Snake was covered in a layer of blood-red mist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The poisonous Rainbow Snake collapsed in mid-air.</p><p>The first of the last 36 formations had been broken!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to break the seal, his fingers moving non-stop. The Crimson blood sand and the poisonous snake’s blood mist were also constantly consumed.</p><p>Soon, the second formation was broken!</p><p>In this way, one after another, Lu Ming cracked the major arrays.</p><p>Every time Lu Ming cracked nine major arrays, he would sit cross-legged and restore his mental energy fire.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>There was only one formation left out of the 36. Chi jinkong and the others stared at it with wide eyes. They were so excited that their breathing became heavy.</p><p>On the other hand, the pure gold Mountain clenched its fists and slowly moved its body to the front, close to Lu Ming’s position.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s fingers moved, inscriptions fell on the ground.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>This time, a total of three seven-colored venomous snakes flew out and crumbled in the air.</p><p>the seal has been broken. The heavens have blessed our red leopard tribe!</p><p>The pure gold Mountain gave a loud cry and was the first to move, directly charging into the valley.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He took a step forward and a vine shot out, wrapping around the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>“What’s going on? Lu Ming, it’s you. What are you doing?”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain roared.</p><p>“Why are you so anxious?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and dashed into the valley.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain roared in anger. A puppet appeared and broke through the vines. He also rushed in. At the same time, the pure gold Mountain and the rest also rushed into the valley.</p><p>The valley was not big. Not long after he rushed in, Lu Ming saw a skeleton leaning against the wall, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Lu Ming saw at a glance that one of the skeleton’s claws was holding a Jade tablet. On its finger was a storage ring.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Behind them, the pure gold Mountain roared angrily.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. With a sweep of his vital essence, he took the Jade card from the skeleton’s storage ring into his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? You want to steal the treasure of the previous clan leader? you’re courting death!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s eyes turned cold as it controlled the puppet to charge towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, another puppet rushed out and blocked the puppet from the pure gold Mountain. It was the pure gold Mountain puppet.</p><p>clan leader, don’t block me. You should have seen that this brat has ulterior motives and wants to seize the previous clan leader’s treasure!</p><p>The pure gold Mountain roared.</p><p>“Pure gold Mountain, what are you so anxious about? Who said I wanted to steal the treasures of your previous clan leader? I’m only here to hand it over to the clan leader!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Jade token and storage ring flew to Chi jinkong. Chi jinkong caught them in his hands.</p><p>Chi tribe leader, that Jade tablet should have been left behind by the previous tribe leader before he died. It should contain some important information, you should take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Pure gold Mountain’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>Chi jinkong picked up the Jade token and sank his spiritual power into it. Then, his expression changed drastically and became extremely ugly.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s figure was slowly moving towards the outside.</p><p>“Elders, take down the pure gold Mountain!”</p><p>Chi jinkong suddenly roared. Although the few elders were stunned, they did not hesitate. Puppets appeared and surrounded the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>“Patriarch, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Pure gold Mountain’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>“What do you mean? Haha, pure gold Mountain, I really didn’t expect that you were the one who betrayed the previous generation clan head. If not for that, how could the previous generation clan head be besieged and fall in the end? before the previous generation clan head died, he had already recorded everything in this Jade token. Pure gold Mountain, how should you be punished?”</p><p>Chi jinkong roared, his eyes red.</p><p>His heart ached. He had never thought that it was the pure gold Mountain that betrayed the previous clan head.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was indeed so.</p><p>Back then, Chi Yue had brought him here and said that he could break the great sealing formation. The pure gold Mountain had opposed it with all its might and had even tried to find a reason to kill Lu Ming. This in itself was very strange.</p><p>The others were hoping that Lu Ming could break the seal and let him try. Only the pure gold Mountain tried its best to stop him. It was as if it was afraid that Lu Ming would break the seal.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had been on guard against him.</p><p>When they were breaking the last formation, Lu Ming had been on guard against him. He used the formation to stop him and was the first to obtain the item left behind by the red leopard tribe’s previous tribe leader. If it were to fall into the pure gold Mountain’s hands, he would definitely destroy the evidence.</p><p>When the few clan elders heard this, their expressions also changed greatly as they looked at the pure gold Mountain with dark faces.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Seeing that he had been exposed, the pure gold Mountain laughed loudly and said, ” “That’s right. I did it all. After so many years, everything should have disappeared. It’s all because of this brat. He destroyed everything. The heavens want me dead.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
