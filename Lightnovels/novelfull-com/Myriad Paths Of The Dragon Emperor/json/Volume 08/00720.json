The pressure from Lian Cang was too strong. It was boundless, as if they were facing the universe.</p><p>...</p><p>In the face of this pressure, the people from the outer realm also knelt down.</p><p>No one was an exception. This was not a question of whether they were willing to kneel or not, but they had no choice but to kneel.</p><p>“This person is the chosen one!”</p><p>A rumbling voice came out from Lian Cang’s mouth.</p><p>Countless people’s eyes were focused on Lu Ming.</p><p>This young man was actually the chosen one. Was he the one who had awakened the ancient ancestor?</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really him. It’s really him!”</p><p>The people of the red leopard tribe were all ecstatic. They were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>It was really Lu Ming, and Lu Ming was sent by the red leopard tribe. What reward would the ancient ancestor give them?</p><p>They were filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Which tribe sent this chosen one?”</p><p>Lian Cang’s voice was heard again. It was as if the heavens were talking. His voice was like thunder, reverberating between heaven and earth.</p><p>“It’s US, it’s the sacred Wind tribe!”</p><p>Before Chi jinkong could say anything, a loud shout was heard.</p><p>There was a group of people in that direction. There were more than a thousand of them, and each of them had a strong aura. They were all rank 6 alchemists above the sea of Souls realm.</p><p>it’s the Holy Wind tribe. This time, the Holy Wind tribe is going to be even stronger.</p><p>“That’s right. The Holy Wind tribe has always been the most powerful tribe with countless experts. Now, the ancient ancestor will definitely reward the destined person. They will become stronger as they grow. In the future, which other tribe will be a match for the Holy Wind tribe?”</p><p>The other tribes started to discuss.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The people of the red leopard tribe roared in their hearts. The sacred Wind tribe was so shameless that they stole their credit.</p><p>However, they didn’t dare to make a sound. The Holy Wind tribe was too powerful. If they made a sound and the ancient ancestor didn’t punish the Holy Wind tribe, the red leopard tribe would be in danger. If the Holy Wind tribe wanted to destroy the red leopard tribe, it would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Holy Wind tribe, how dare you lie to me! You must die!</p><p>Lian Cang’s rumbling voice resounded. Two beams of light shot out from his eyes towards the Holy Wind tribe.</p><p>“Ah, ancient ancestor, please spare me!”</p><p>The people of the Holy Wind tribe cried out in fear.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. The two beams of light swept past, and the people of the Holy Wind tribe all disappeared, turning into ashes.</p><p>Including the extraterrestrials who had come with the sacred Wind tribe, they had all disappeared.</p><p>The two gazes, both dead.</p><p>Even though there was only a wisp of Lian Cang’s soul left and it was about to dissipate, his power was still terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, everyone present was as silent as cicadas in winter, not even daring to breathe loudly.</p><p>the Holy Wind tribe doesn’t need to exist in this world. All the tribes should attack it together!</p><p>Said Lian Cang.</p><p>“I will obey the ancient ancestor’s decree!”</p><p>Countless tribes responded loudly.</p><p>With just one sentence from Lian Cang, the number one tribe in the underground world was doomed.</p><p>I already know that the red leopard tribe is the one who has delivered the heavenly mandate. Now, I will bestow upon you a spiritual cultivation method!</p><p>As soon as Lian Cang finished his words, a Jade token flew towards the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Chi jinkong received it respectfully and quickly kowtowed, ” “Thank you for your gift, ancient ancestor!”</p><p>He was extremely excited.</p><p>A spiritual cultivation technique. It was actually a spiritual cultivation technique. This was a priceless treasure. Given time, how many experts could their red leopard tribe produce?</p><p>In the future, it was possible for them to become the strongest tribe in the underground world.</p><p>There were so many tribes in the underground world, but none of them had a spiritual cultivation technique. This was the legendary Holy Bible.</p><p>The other tribes were extremely envious.</p><p>Some people looked at the Jade token in Chi jinkong’s hand with burning eyes.</p><p>“Also, each of these nine inscription scrolls can kill those above the God level. You can keep them!”</p><p>Lian Cang’s voice was heard again. The nine inscription scrolls flew towards Chi jinkong.</p><p>“Thank you for your gift, ancient ancestor!”</p><p>Chi jinkong received it and bowed again.</p><p>With these nine inscription talismans, he could ensure the safety of the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Some of the tribes with other thoughts immediately felt their hearts turn cold.</p><p>It was obvious that the ancient ancestor wanted to protect the red leopard tribe. How could they dare to have any disloyal thoughts?</p><p>“Chi Yue, clan leader Chi, Lu Ming will take his leave now!” At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice entered Chi Yue and Chi jinkong’s ears.</p><p>Chi Yue looked up and saw the ancient ancestor wave his hand. Lu Ming’s figure disappeared.</p><p>Chi Yue felt lost and sighed in her heart. She knew that after today’s farewell, they might never see each other again.</p><p>Lu Ming was a heaven’s favorite from the outer world. The outer world was so vast, and the underground was only a stop in Lu Ming’s journey.</p><p>At the same time, Lian Cang disappeared. Jian feiliu, who was standing in a tribe, also disappeared.</p><p>The surrounding environment changed. Lu Ming realized that he had returned to the cave.</p><p>With a flash of light, Lian Cang appeared. At the same time, Jian feiliu appeared as well.</p><p>As soon as Jian feiliu appeared, he retreated hurriedly and put on a vigilant look. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>He looked at Lian Cang, Lu Ming, and Xie nianqing and said,”Brother Lu, what’s going on?”</p><p>“Brother Jian, in a few days, the three of us will go out and return to the outside world. As for other matters, please don’t ask too much.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Jian feiliu was stunned. However, even though he had many doubts in his heart, since Lu Ming said not to ask too much, it most likely involved some of Lu Ming’s secrets. Jian feiliu was smart and naturally did not ask too much.</p><p>For the rest of the time, Lu Ming and Jian feiliu sat cross-legged, waiting for Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s consciousness sank into his mind and he realized that there was a shiny object in his mind. There were layers and layers of formations on it. This was the sealing formation that Liao Cang had sealed in his mind. It was related to Liao Cang’s Dao of refinement and cultivation experience.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the mental energy fire and moved closer to the seal array.</p><p>The first level of the array was not very strong. It was broken through by the mental energy fire not long after. Lu Ming found himself in an extremely vast space. There were countless Lian cangs sitting cross-legged, explaining the Dao of inscription and their cultivation experience.</p><p>It was as if there were countless Lian cangs teaching him how to cultivate. He would listen to any one of them.</p><p>“Amazing, truly amazing.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He stopped in front of one of the Lian cangs and started to listen.</p><p>After this Lian Cang explained for a while, he repeated what he had just said. Lu Ming listened to it a few times and felt that he had understood it. He walked to the next Lian Cang.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming continued to listen to them one by one.</p><p>These were all Lian Cang’s knowledge and cultivation experience about the Dao of inscription of Level 5 and below.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had already reached the limit of the fifth-level, he realized that he still had many shortcomings after listening to it. His Foundation in the Dao of inscription was becoming more and more solid.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>On the fourth day, Xie nianqing’s aura began to rise rapidly. The black cocoon floating above her head began to crack.</p><p>Lu Ming and Jian feiliu finished their cultivation and looked at Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
