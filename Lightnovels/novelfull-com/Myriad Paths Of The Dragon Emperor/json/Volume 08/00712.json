It was indeed mysterious and was an ancient formation that had gone extinct.</p><p>...</p><p>However, there was a flaw in this kind of large array. It was too complicated to inscribe and required a very long time. It was impossible to activate it instantly. Moreover, it was only useful against puppets, so it slowly disappeared in the long river of history.</p><p>However, it was just right for now.</p><p>After walking out of the West City gate, Lu Ming began to inscribe.</p><p>One by one, the complicated inscriptions sank into the ground and disappeared.</p><p>As time slowly passed, the red leopard tribe began to recall their forces to guard their headquarters. The yin snake tribe also began to gather a large number of people to prepare for battle.</p><p>The other tribes were all observing the battle. Even if the yin snake tribe could destroy the red leopard tribe, they would suffer some losses. The other tribes would naturally sit on the mountain and watch.</p><p>Three days passed quickly.</p><p>On the third day, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Chi Yue, Chi jinkong, and the others stood on the city wall. There were people everywhere on the city wall.</p><p>In the sky above the ancient city, many people summoned their puppets and sat on their backs, floating in the sky.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, chijin Kong’s voice sounded.</p><p>Three huge snake puppets flew towards them from the sky. They were Yin Buhai and the two elders of the yin snake tribe.</p><p>More of the yin snake tribe’s Army rode on the giant snake puppets and followed the ground to the rear.</p><p>Yin Buhai and the two clan elders stopped in the sky a few miles away.</p><p>“Kid, you killed my son?”</p><p>Yin Buhai looked at Lu Ming and said in a cold and heartless voice.</p><p>“That’s right, he, should die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply was very simple.</p><p>good, very good. Boy, I swear that I will make you suffer the most painful torture in the world. I will make you face a dilemma of life and death!</p><p>His eyes were frighteningly dark, like those of a poisonous snake.</p><p>Then, he looked at jinkong Chi and said,”jinkong Chi, it seems like you don’t want to hand him over?” Are you planning to bury the entire red leopard tribe with this kid?”</p><p>“If you have the ability, you can try!”</p><p>Chi Jin said. His attitude was clear.</p><p>“Good, very good. It seems that you have forgotten the dignity of the yin snake tribe after a few years of not conquering it. In that case, the red leopard tribe shall be destroyed!”</p><p>Yin Buhai’s voice spread far and wide. As soon as he said the word ‘dangmie’, a deafening battle cry came from behind.</p><p>“Kill! Raze the red leopard tribe to the ground!”</p><p>“Kill all the men, but leave the young women behind!”</p><p>……</p><p>The yin snake tribe members shouted as they controlled the giant snake puppet to follow the ground and rush towards the red leopard tribe’s ancient city.</p><p>There were too many people, at least twenty thousand giant snake puppets, and two people were sitting on each of them.</p><p>One engraved a defensive formation, while the other controlled the puppets and shot arrows at the same time. They were well coordinated.</p><p>“Prepare the bows and arrows!”</p><p>Chi Jin waved his hand.</p><p>Instantly, tens of thousands of people nocked their arrows.</p><p>“Fire!”</p><p>Chi Jin waved his hand again.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A large number of arrows were shot towards the yin snake tribe’s Army. Each arrow had a rune on it.</p><p>There were powerful explosive runes, as well as Gale runes that could increase speed and penetration.</p><p>More than ten thousand arrows covered the sky.</p><p>The yin snake tribe’s Army began to glow with runes and formations. Light barriers appeared one after another, covering both the puppets and humans. At the same time, a portion of the yin snake tribe’s Army also drew their bows and shot arrows at the red leopard tribe.</p><p>At the same time, elder Gu of the red leopard tribe also activated his inscription formation.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sound of the explosion reverberated unceasingly, and the ground was constantly shaking and shaking.</p><p>This kind of battle was a battle between alchemists, which was completely different from the battle between an Army of Warriors. However, the momentum was not small at all.</p><p>However, the yin snake tribe had more people and more experts. They were constantly advancing and shooting their arrows. The red leopard tribe was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Summon the puppets and prepare for a great battle!”</p><p>Chi jinkong ordered.</p><p>The defensive light shield formed by the great inscription formation on the ancient city was shaking continuously. It would not last for long.</p><p>More cheetah puppets appeared on the city walls and in the sky.</p><p>The yin snake tribe’s Army was getting closer and closer. They were only a few miles away from the red leopard tribe’s ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the city wall, his gaze sweeping across the distance.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming mumbled. His hands glowed with a green light and he started to inscribe in the air rapidly. Finally, it turned into a large inscription array and flew down to the ground outside the city wall.</p><p>“Great formation, rise!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the entire ground seemed to shake. Then, countless inscriptions appeared on the ground. One formation after another, it was unknown how many there were in total, but they covered an area of thirty miles in length and width.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming spent three days and did his best to inscribe a large array within a thirty-mile radius.</p><p>Almost all of the yin snake Army was covered in the mist.</p><p>At this moment, the yin snake tribe was in an uproar.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why can’t I control the puppets?”</p><p>me too. It seems like my connection with the puppet has been cut off.</p><p>“How could this be? I’ll try. Ah, I can’t control it either.”</p><p>All sorts of terrified cries rang out.</p><p>Those who were originally only assisting with the inscribing array also summoned their own puppets, but the result was the same. All of them were cut off from their puppets.</p><p>The tens of thousands of giant snake puppets were like rocks, standing there motionlessly.</p><p>“Kill, kill, puppet troops, kill!”</p><p>Seeing this, Chi jinkong’s eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p>He knew that he had made the right bet.</p><p>He took the lead and rushed out of the city.</p><p>Those who had been secretly taught and cultivated the puppet controlling technique that Lu Ming had taught them all followed Chi jinkong. They rode on the cheetah puppet and rushed outside.</p><p>This Army had a total of 8000 people, and each of them had a cheetah puppet. They were the true elites of the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Originally, there were only 8000 of them, but the yin snake tribe had sent out 40000 elites. They were no match for the yin snake tribe.</p><p>But now, he couldn’t control the yin snake tribe’s puppets. He could only use inscriptions and runes to fight them. The difference in combat power was unknown.</p><p>There was a huge difference in combat strength between having a puppet and not having one.</p><p>Chi jinkong led his 8000-strong Army and charged into the yin snake tribe’s Army. Instantly, all sorts of howls and screams rose and fell.</p><p>One-sided, completely one-sided. Although the yin snake tribe tried their best to resist, it was still one-sided. Without the puppets, they had lost their most powerful weapon.</p><p>As for the red leopard tribe, they controlled the puppets and attacked with all their might.</p><p>The puppets were not afraid of pain or death. They madly charged forward, tearing apart the yin snake tribesmen one after another. Blood splattered all over the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
