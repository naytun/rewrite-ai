He had helped the red leopard tribe, but the pure gold Mountain had repeatedly stopped him. With his personality, he would have turned around and left long ago.</p><p>The reason why he stayed was firstly because of Red Moon. Secondly, if he turned around and left now, he would definitely not be valued by the red leopard tribe. He wanted to use the red leopard tribe’s power to find out where Xie nianqing was.</p><p>“Since you want to see it, open your eyes wide and watch!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At the same time, a Scarlet ring appeared above Lu Ming’s head. There were ten points on the ring that were as dazzling as the stars.</p><p>“Ten, ten mind lamps!”</p><p>he lit up ten mind lamps in the first stage!</p><p>Chi jinkong, the seven elders, and the others were all shocked. Some of the elders even shouted.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. Its mouth was so wide that it could swallow a dead rat. It looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>In the first stage, Lu Ming could actually light ten mental lamps and enter the perfect stage.</p><p>haha, I told you. Lu Ming’s talent is the best in the extraterrestrial world!</p><p>After Chi Yue’s initial shock, he laughed out loud.</p><p>Hmph, it’s only the first stage. Maybe he’s just lucky and obtained a powerful fire seed that allowed him to light up the ten lamps in the first stage. It’s not like there haven’t been such cases in history, but the later stages, the harder it is to light up the lamps. I’ll see how many lamps he can light in the later stages!</p><p>Pure gold Mountain said with a dark expression.</p><p>“Father is right!” Chi Feng chimed in from the side.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then open your dog eyes wide and take a good look!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. Then, a light flashed again above his head. This time, two rings appeared in succession, one orange and one yellow.</p><p>The two rings were the same as the first one. They both had ten bright spots that were dazzling and mesmerizing.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. Their eyes widened in shock.</p><p>The first three stages were all perfect, and he lit up ten spirit lamps each. This was too shocking.</p><p>Pure gold Mountain’s face was flushed red, while Chi Feng was dumbstruck.</p><p>Didn’t they want to see it? Then, he would let him take a good look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Continue watching!”</p><p>The sneer on Lu Ming’s face grew wider. The next moment, two rings appeared above his head.</p><p>There were two rings, one green and one cyan, and each had ten bright spots.</p><p>The five Rings were stacked on top of each other, and the fifty bright spots almost blinded the pure gold Mountain’s eyes.</p><p>perfect, all perfect. All five stages are perfect. Oh my God, what did I just see? ”</p><p>miracle! Genius! He’s the strongest genius I’ve ever seen. Yue ‘er is right, he’s the number one genius in the outer realm!</p><p>A few clan elders who were hundreds of years old could no longer control their emotions. They shouted one after another, their faces and ears red with excitement.</p><p>Chi Yue’s small mouth opened into an ‘O’ shape as she stood there in a daze. After a while, her eyes were filled with a strange light.</p><p>As for the pure gold Mountain and the pure peak, they looked as if they had seen a ghost. They looked at Lu Ming, unable to say a single word, their lips trembling non-stop.</p><p>Five stages and ten spirit lamps were lit. This was simply a legend. They had never heard of such a genius in their world.</p><p>In fact, there was a rumor in this world that nine was the limit and there was no way to be perfect.</p><p>In other words, lighting up nine spirit lamps was the limit. Perfection was only a legend after all. It was an expected realm, but now, it had actually appeared in a young man in his twenties.</p><p>“My current spiritual power should be enough, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze continued to fall on pure gold Mountain.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s expression changed, becoming extremely unsightly. He didn’t say a single word, he couldn’t open his mouth.</p><p>good, good, good. Brother Lu is indeed the number one genius in outer space. I believe that brother Lu will be able to break the seal!</p><p>Chi jinkong laughed, his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>“That’s right. Little brother, please come forward and check those inscription arrays and see how you can crack them.”</p><p>A white-haired clan elder said in an extremely excited manner.</p><p>Other than Chi jinkong and Chi Feng, everyone looked at Lu Ming with anticipation.</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming could really do it?</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked forward. He came to the place full of runes and looked at it carefully.</p><p>“Dandan, can you really crack it?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>The seal here was made up of three completely different formations. There were more than a hundred of them. The three different formations were linked and intertwined with each other. Furthermore, they were all extremely profound level six inscription formations.</p><p>The patriarchs of the Sirius, Yin snake, and blood Tiger tribes who had set up the formation were all peak level-six inscriptionists. To be honest, with Lu Ming’s current attainment in the Dao of inscriptions, it was still very difficult for him to crack it.</p><p>The reason why he agreed was because dandan had told him that it could break it.</p><p>“Nonsense, don’t you know what kind of existence I am? the head of the top ten war beasts, I have lived for countless years. I understand astronomy at the top and yin and yang at the bottom. How can a mere level six inscription array be difficult for me?”</p><p>Dandan began to boast again. Of course, she did it through voice transmission, so no one else could hear her.</p><p>Lu Ming was already used to it. He directly ignored the part where dandan boasted and said, ” “Oh? How can we break it?”</p><p>“Kid, listen up. We’ll start with the 18 flame inscriptions, then the 7 explosion inscriptions …”</p><p>Dandan began to give pointers.</p><p>Between Lu Ming’s fingers, a green flame spread out and he began to inscribe in the air. Runes appeared one after another and flew into the ground at the entrance of the canyon in different directions.</p><p>Everyone from the red leopard tribe stared with wide eyes.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>Suddenly, a Wolf’s howl could be heard. An array glowed and condensed into a giant wolf, which pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s heart tightened, and the pure gold Mountain’s eyes brightened.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he allowed the giant wolf to pounce on him. When the giant wolf pounced in front of Lu Ming, it exploded with a bang, turned into spots of light and dissipated.</p><p>The first formation was broken!</p><p>“The first formation is broken!”</p><p>“It’s really broken!”</p><p>Chi jinkong and the seven clan elders were all ecstatic.</p><p>“Father, elder, look. I’m right. Lu Ming can definitely do it.”</p><p>Chi Yue said with a smile.</p><p>yes, but this seal is made up of 136 formations. The deeper you go, the harder it is to break. We’ll have to see what happens later.</p><p>Chi jinkong said.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming continued to inscribe runes. One after another, runes flew to the ground. After a while, a roar was heard and a blood-red giant Tiger pounced out and then dissipated.</p><p>The second formation was broken!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s fingers did not stop. He continued to inscribe runes in the air. One after another, the major arrays were cracked by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming broke through eighteen large arrays in a row at a crushing speed. He took less than half an hour.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
