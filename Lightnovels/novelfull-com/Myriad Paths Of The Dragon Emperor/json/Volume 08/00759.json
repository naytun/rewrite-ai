There’s also miss Xie. Calm down, calm down. I’ll settle this!”</p><p>...</p><p>Kong Jin suddenly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes glowed with a cold light. He was stunned.</p><p>At this moment, Kong Jin stepped out and shouted, ” “I say, you two old fogeys, are you treating me like air? Now, quickly kneel down and apologize to these girls, and this Lord can consider giving you a lighter punishment!”</p><p>These sudden words caused ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, and Shi Kai to be stunned.</p><p>“Fat pig, what did you just say?”</p><p>An old man’s face darkened.</p><p>“Old man, are you deaf? I told you to kneel down and admit your mistakes!”</p><p>Kong Jin said with a cold face.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly but did not step forward. This fatty wanted to show off in front of the beautiful woman. He would let him.</p><p>Anyway, in Lu Ming’s heart, these two old fellows from the Miao family were dead for sure.</p><p>Xie nianqing snorted but did not make a move.</p><p>“Fatty, you … You don’t want to live anymore.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s face was as white as snow. She walked to Kong Jin’s side and whispered.</p><p>“Tingting, don’t worry. With me here, no one can hurt you. I can suppress these two old men with one hand!”</p><p>Kong Jin straightened his back and shouted.</p><p>He was speaking the truth. The two elders were both at the peak first level of the spiritual ocean tier. He was confident that he could suppress them with one hand.</p><p>“It’s over, it’s over!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, and the others thought that fatty was bragging and sighed in their hearts. Today, they were definitely done for.</p><p>In fact, they had already decided that they would rather die than fall into the hands of these two old men.</p><p>fat pig, if you want to be the hero saving the beauty, why don’t you take a look at your own capabilities first? I’ll chop you up right now!</p><p>An old man revealed a cold smile on his face. His figure moved as fast as lightning, and he clawed at the fatty.</p><p>Fast, too fast, and a huge pressure spread out, pressing down on ruan Tingting and the others. They only felt that there was an incomparably heavy mountain on their bodies, and they couldn’t even resist.</p><p>The difference between ordinary peak-tier Kings and first level spiritual ocean tier supreme beings was too great, and they could kill a large group with a single slap.</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the other two were in despair. They realized that they might not even be able to commit suicide in the hands of the two old men.</p><p>However, the next moment, their eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>The fat man reached out his hand and grabbed the old man’s wrist.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The next moment, the sound of bones breaking came from the old man’s wrist, followed by the old man’s shrill scream.</p><p>“Stupid fat pig, let me go!”</p><p>The old man roared. His body was filled with green true essence, and his cultivation erupted. His other palm smashed toward Kong Jin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kong Jin was very direct. He raised his arm and swung it. The old man’s body was like a broken gunny sack, heavily thrown to the ground. With a boom, the ground shook, and the old man’s body hit the ground, creating a big pit. The intent realm and Zhen Yuan on his body all disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Kong Jin swung his arm again.</p><p>The old man created another hole in the ground, and even the secret room started to shake.</p><p>The old man was lying in the pit, spitting out blood. His body was like a pile of mud, and his eyes were filled with disbelief and fear.</p><p>With his cultivation at the peak first level of the spiritual ocean tier, he actually had no power to resist Kong Jin.</p><p>Kong Jin said that he would suppress him with one hand, so he did it.</p><p>“Freak, he’s a freak!” The old man roared in his heart.</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, and Shi Kai were already petrified. Their eyes were wide open as they looked at Kong Jin’s ‘tall and straight’ figure.</p><p>Especially ruan Tingting. She had known Kong Jin for a while now, but she had never seen him hand anything. She never dreamed that this lazy fatty would be so terrifying.</p><p>A first level spiritual ocean tier cultivator was as weak as a baby in Kong Jin’s hands.</p><p>This was simply too unbelievable. It was like a dream.</p><p>a clown. How dare you be so rude to Tingting. You’re looking for death!</p><p>Kong Jin straightened his chest with all his might, trying to look as mighty and extraordinary as possible.</p><p>“Tsk, you really know how to act!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said in disdain.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose.</p><p>“Go, go quickly. Bring the experts of the Miao family here and kill this fatty. I want them to die, all of them!”</p><p>The mud-like old man roared.</p><p>The old man at the entrance of the passage suddenly reacted and turned to run.</p><p>However, the moment he turned around, he suddenly saw a figure standing at the entrance of the passage, looking at him with a faint smile.</p><p>It was Lu Ming, but he did not know when Lu Ming had appeared there.</p><p>“Brat, get lost!”</p><p>He could not be bothered to think too much. He roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying true essence and concept condensed into a sharp blade and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming as quickly as possible and then escape. He could not let the fatty catch up to him. He was too terrifying.</p><p>He swore in his heart that as long as he could escape, he would bring the experts of the Miao family to kill that fatty and destroy the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Then, he saw Lu Ming stretch out his palm and slap him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The saber-light that he had unleashed with all his might was as fragile as tofu in front of Lu Ming’s palm. Wherever Lu Ming’s palm passed, all his attacks and defenses turned into bubbles. Then, Lu Ming’s palm landed on his face ruthlessly.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out. The old man felt the world spin around him. His body flew far away and fell in front of Kong Jin. Blood spurted out of his mouth, and he was dumbfounded.</p><p>The old man who was like a pile of mud was also confused.</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, Shi Kai, and the rest’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. They looked at Lu Ming in a daze, then at the old man who had been slapped until he was dizzy. They rubbed their eyes hard, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others were no longer speaking fluently.</p><p>They didn’t know what to say.</p><p>First, it was empty advance, then Lu Ming.</p><p>In their hands, two first level spiritual ocean tier powerful beings were simply trash, dolls, without the slightest ability to resist.</p><p>Birds of a feather flock together.</p><p>They thought of this sentence.</p><p>That fatty was so powerful. How could Lu Ming be weak? And Xie nianqing.</p><p>They looked at Xie nianqing, who still had a look of disdain on his face, and were speechless.</p><p>Who were these people? Could he be a top figure on the list of top 1000 talents?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re snatching it from me again?” Kong Jin cast an ‘unhappy’ glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m just afraid that he’ll run away.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>Hmph, with me here, where can he run to? it’s just a matter of minutes to get rid of these two pieces of trash. Alright, Tingting, how do we get rid of them now? ”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at ruan Tingting.</p><p>kill them! We must kill them! Otherwise, the Miao family will not let us off when they return!</p><p>Before ruan Tingting could say anything, Qiao Xuan spoke up in a decisive manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
