How did this happen?”</p><p>...</p><p>In the sky, Yin Buhai let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few elders of the red leopard tribe controlled their puppets and flew into the sky, attacking Yin Buhai and the others.</p><p>The rest of the clan elders and elders worked with jinkong Chi to kill some of the yin snake tribe’s experts.</p><p>the rest of you, control the puppets and surround them in the sky. Kill anyone who tries to escape!</p><p>Chi Jintian was on the city wall, giving orders.</p><p>There were at least 10000 people from the red leopard tribe controlling puppets to fly into the sky and surround the yin snake tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the city wall and did not make a move. The situation was clear for this battle. There was no need for him to make a move.</p><p>Besides, he had no desire to fight. He realized that the blood essence of an inscriber contained a very limited amount of power. It was also of limited help to him. Only martial arts powerhouses or powerful demonic beasts would have extremely powerful blood essence.</p><p>This was understandable. An inscriber specialized in mental energy fire, physical strength, and blood Qi. Of course, they could not be compared to martial arts powerhouses.</p><p>Battle cries resounded through the heavens and earth.</p><p>There were still many people on top of red leopard ancient city. However, most of these people had low cultivation and did not have any puppets. Hence, they did not leave the city to participate in the battle and only guarded the city walls.</p><p>As time passed, the battle cries gradually died down. The air was filled with blood and the ground was covered with corpses.</p><p>The battle lasted for two hours before it finally quieted down.</p><p>The yin snake tribe’s Army was almost completely annihilated. Only a few powerful elders managed to escape, but they were also severely injured.</p><p>Even Yin Buhai had been captured with serious injuries.</p><p>Under the siege of several elders of the red leopard tribe, he was severely injured.</p><p>In fact, the red leopard tribe’s high-end combat power was not much weaker than the yin snake tribe’s. These experts had all risen to power 60 years ago.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yin Buhai was thrown on the city wall, right beside Lu Ming’s feet.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I’ll leave Yin Buhai to you!”</p><p>At this moment, the red leopard tribe’s elders and elders looked at Lu Ming with eyes filled with gratitude and respect. This battle was all because of Lu Ming. Otherwise, the outcome would have been the complete opposite.</p><p>“How could this be? Why does the red leopard tribe have such a powerful formation that can cut off the connection between humans and puppets? I’ve never heard of it before!”</p><p>Yin Buhai shouted.</p><p>“I was the one who carved this formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yin Buhai and said coldly.</p><p>“It’s you? It’s you, it’s you again! Hahaha, could it be that the heavens want the yin snake tribe to be destroyed?”</p><p>Yin Buhai shouted unwillingly.</p><p>this is called self-inflicted suffering. Little Qing is in the hands of your Yin snake tribe. If you had treated her well, how could she have ended up in this disaster? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Yin Buhai looked at Xie nianqing and laughed. His laughter was filled with mixed emotions. He didn’t know if it was regret or unwillingness.</p><p>Treat her well? The yin snake tribe ruled over dozens of tribes in the surrounding area. They were used to being rude and unreasonable. Bullying happened every day in the yin snake tribe. After so many years, the yin snake tribe had still become more and more prosperous. Nothing had happened to them.</p><p>Who would have known that because of Xie nianqing, she had offended someone she shouldn’t have. She could only say that she was just unlucky.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and a combat sword formed. He pinned Yin Buhai to the city wall and his storage ring fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Warriors of the red leopard tribe, follow me and attack the ancient city of the yin snake tribe!”</p><p>Chi jinkong’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>This time, the yin snake tribe had sent out 40000 elite soldiers with the intention of flattening the red leopard tribe in one fell swoop. However, the defenses of the red leopard tribe’s ancient city were definitely the weakest. This was the best time to attack.</p><p>“I’m willing to follow the chief and raze the yin snake tribe to the ground!”</p><p>The red leopard tribe’s warrior roared.</p><p>Immediately, the Army of over 10000 soldiers controlled the puppets and headed in the direction of the yin snake tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming did not participate in this battle. He returned to the ancient city with Xie nianqing and cultivated in seclusion.</p><p>The yin snake tribe’s elites had been exterminated, and even Yin Buhai had died. The outcome of this battle was almost predictable.</p><p>In the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming had the path-understanding ancient tree next to him and a piece of earth intent crystal in his hand.</p><p>Back then, on the small island in the heaven realm, Lu Ming had obtained many types of earth profound crystals. The number was not less than the Wind and Fire profound crystals.</p><p>Now, the force of the earth had already fused with the three intents. Now, it was time to improve.</p><p>There were nine types of commonly seen heaven and earth intent realms: wind, fire, water, metal, wood, Thunder, ice, earth, and mountain.</p><p>As for the earth mentality, it was similar to the earth and mountain mentalities, but it was more advanced. It could be said to be an evolved version of the two mentalities. It was a special kind of mentality that was full of heaviness, vicissitudes, and ancientness.</p><p>Not only was its offensive power extremely shocking, suppressing everything, but its defensive power was also extremely terrifying. It was an extremely powerful intent realm.</p><p>Right now, he was only at the beginner stage of Earth Force and could not unleash its power. When Lu Ming improved it, the power it could unleash would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>He crushed an earth profound crystal and started cultivating.</p><p>One after another, three days later, Lu Ming had consumed a total of thirty earth profound crystals. He had cultivated Earth Force to large success, just a step away from perfection.</p><p>It was obvious that Earth Force was harder to cultivate than the nine commonly seen forces or intents.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>In the past three days, Chi jinkong had led his Army to battle. Now, he had finally returned.</p><p>Without a doubt, the yin snake tribe had been destroyed. The red leopard tribe had broken into the ancient city, and many people had surrendered to the red leopard tribe.</p><p>In particular, the large areas of land that had been occupied by the yin snake tribe in the past, as well as the tribesmen of the red leopard tribe who had been enslaved by the yin snake tribe, had all returned to the red leopard tribe. In a short time, the red leopard tribe’s strength and reputation had greatly increased.</p><p>The surrounding tribes were all shocked. They had never thought that the powerful Yin snake tribe would be destroyed.</p><p>Immediately, all the tribes strengthened their defenses. This was especially so for the tribes that had enmity with the red leopard tribe. They were even more jittery and strengthened their defenses by several times.</p><p>The red leopard tribe held a grand celebration.</p><p>During the celebration, Chi jinkong and the other leaders of the red leopard tribe thanked Lu Ming in public.</p><p>This battle was all because of Lu Ming. Many people were secretly glad that they had chosen to believe in Lu Ming. Otherwise, how could there be such results?</p><p>The red leopard tribe had been suppressed ever since the previous tribe leader was killed and sealed. After being suppressed for so many years, they finally had the feeling of being able to hold their heads up high. Naturally, they were excited.</p><p>Everyone was happy, but there were two people who weren’t happy. They were the pure gold Mountain and the pure peak.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain growled in a low voice. He clenched his fists so tightly that cracking sounds could be heard. His eyes were fixed on Lu Ming. If looks could kill, Lu Ming would have long pierced through a thousand holes.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He seemed to have sensed something and suddenly turned to look at the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain was shocked and quickly turned its head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I knew I was right. When I first saw you, I knew you were the legendary destined one.”</p><p>Chi Yue walked in front of Lu Ming, her big eyes blinking. She was very excited.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
