Shangguan Wu Ling let out a blood-curdling scream as her body was sent flying far away. She fell tens of meters away. Her hair was disheveled and one side of her face was swollen. She looked at Lu Ming in a daze, completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to hit her. He actually dared to slap her? Not even in her dreams did she expect this.</p><p>“You’re just a Mad Dog, you don’t want face when I give you face!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, Shangguan Wu Ling finally reacted and let out a hysterical scream. Her eyes revealed endless viciousness as she glared at Lu Ming and shouted,”Little bastard, you dare to hit me? I want you dead! I want to skin you alive!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand again and slapped the other side of Shangguan Wu Ling’s face across the air. Immediately, her body flew out again and fell to the ground. She spat out a large mouthful of blood and was completely stunned.</p><p>“How dare you! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen bellowed in rage. He moved his body and struck a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and all of Shangguan wuchen’s attacks turned into bubbles. The next moment, he felt a tight grip on his throat. His throat had been grabbed by Lu Ming’s iron-like claws.</p><p>There was a look of disbelief in his eyes. Lu Ming had actually destroyed all his attacks and defenses with one move and grabbed his throat.</p><p>“Do you still think that I’m the same person as I was back then?”</p><p>Lu Ming clasped Shangguan Wu Chen’s neck and lifted him up high. Shangguan Wu Chen’s face was flushed red. The vital essence in his body could not be mobilized at all. It had been sealed by Lu Ming.</p><p>His heart was in a state of shock.</p><p>How long had it been? not even a year! Back in the Tianxuan region, he was a mighty sea of soul realm expert who looked down on Lu Ming. In his eyes, Lu Ming was like an ant that he could kill at will.</p><p>But now? In Lu Ming’s hands, he was so weak and defenseless. It was completely the opposite of what it was before.</p><p>boy, let go of your hand. Lord wuchen is a direct descendant of the Shangguan family. If anything happens to him, you’ll be dead!</p><p>A young man who had been following behind Shangguan Wu Chen burst out with a powerful aura that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>This youth had a cultivation at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The young man was shocked and shouted,”you’re bullying the weak. What kind of skill is that?” If you have the ability, fight me!”</p><p>all right, no fighting is allowed at the entrance of the hundred venerated mountains. If you have any grudges, leave this place or enter the hundred venerated mountains to settle them!</p><p>At this moment, an old voice was heard from the entrance of the hundred venerated mountain.</p><p>The young man from the Shangguan clan’s expression changed when he heard the voice, and he immediately retracted his aura.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and threw Shangguan wuchen away.</p><p>“Get out of the way. If you want to find me, I’ll be waiting for you in the hundred venerated mountains!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the young man.</p><p>Although this young man’s cultivation was at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, he did not give Lu Ming any pressure at all.</p><p>Clearly, he was not a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>In the superior environment of ninedragons, some big families like the Shangguan family, especially the six great ancient families, definitely had many young men under the age of thirty who had reached the sea of soul realm.</p><p>However, these people were not heaven’s favorites. Their combat strength was not strong and their potential was limited.</p><p>If they really had to fight, Lu Ming could suppress them with a flip of his hand.</p><p>The young man snorted coldly and rushed toward Shangguan Wu Chen and the others to check their injuries.</p><p>you’re so weak, yet you still want to find trouble. How boring!</p><p>Kong Jin pursed his lips.</p><p>They walked towards the entrance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the Shangguan family still has a few other geniuses. You have to be careful!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan whispered.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He had never been afraid of challenges. Only challenges could make him improve faster.</p><p>The Group of Eight showed their mountain entrance tokens and naturally entered the hundred venerated mountains without any obstructions.</p><p>“Little bastard, little bastard, I want him dead!”</p><p>On the platform, Shangguan Wu Ling was screaming. Her face was ferocious, like a fierce ghost.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to slap her. How dare he?</p><p>Yan kuangtu dared to slap him, but so did Lu Ming?</p><p>Although Shangguan Wu Ling’s cultivation level was low, her status was not low. She was the daughter of an elder of the Shangguan clan who had real power. She had been pampered since she was young. Who would dare to hit her?</p><p>“How about this? let’s go back first. I’ll call a few experts from the clan to enter the hundred venerated mountains and kill that Lu Ming!”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go back first!”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen nodded and the three of them flew toward the Shangguan family.</p><p>When they returned to the Shangguan family, they met a few people.</p><p>“Mother, uncle, what’s wrong? Who did this? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>One of the youths was Saint Xingchen. He could see the injuries of Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling with a single glance.</p><p>Especially Shangguan Wu Ling, both sides of her face were swollen, and it had not disappeared until now.</p><p>This made the killing intent of the sacred constellation extremely strong.</p><p>“Xingchen, you’ve come out of seclusion? It’s Lu Ming. It’s that little b * stard Lu Ming. He actually dared to hit me!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming? It’s him!” Holy constellation’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>A majestic voice rang out.</p><p>The one who spoke was a tall and strong old man. His eyes were sharp, and he gave off an imposing aura.</p><p>This old man was the Father of Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling. He was an elder with real power in the Shangguan family.</p><p>“Father, it’s like this!” Shangguan wuchen briefly explained the matter.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re simply courting death. I’m going to the hundred venerated mountains to kill him now!”</p><p>The Holy star’s killing intent exploded, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Sacred constellation’s cultivation had also broken through to the spiritual ocean tier, and it wasn’t the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, but the second level.</p><p>Xingchen, it’s not a good time for you to fight now. Your bloodline is extraordinary. It’s the seven stars of heavenly Dipper. If you can awaken the real seven stars of heavenly Dipper, it’ll definitely be a divine bloodline. The most important thing for you now is to cultivate in seclusion and awaken the third bloodline. If you can awaken a divine bloodline, you’ll be able to enter the ranks of divine level geniuses. You’ll have more capital in the battle of Providence!</p><p>The old man said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Grandpa, are you going to let Lu Ming off? I’m not willing!”</p><p>Sheng Xingchen said.</p><p>“Compared to you awakening a divine bloodline, this is a small matter. How about this, Jin Jue, bring a few men and bring Lu Ming’s head to me!”</p><p>The old man turned around and said to the other youth.</p><p>“Don’t worry, elder. Lu Ming will definitely die!”</p><p>The young man smiled.</p><p>As for Shangguan Wu Chen and the others, their faces were also filled with joy.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue was the Shangguan family’s Supreme talent. He was ranked 465th on the list of top 1000 talents. With him, Lu Ming was doomed.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue then turned around and left.</p><p>……</p><p>After Lu Ming and the other eight stepped through the door, they appeared on another platform in the next moment.</p><p>This platform was built on a cliff. As far as the eye could see, what appeared in front of them was a mountain peak that rose into the clouds. The clouds were dense and it was like a dream.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
