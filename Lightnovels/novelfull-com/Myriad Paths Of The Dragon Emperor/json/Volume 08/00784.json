He focused his mind and unleashed the Wind and Fire concepts to resist with all his might.</p><p>...</p><p>Although every attack would make the long spear condensed by Lu Ming’s Wind and Fire concept tremble as if it would collapse at any time, Lu Ming would block it every time.</p><p>Lu Ming blocked and comprehended.</p><p>Outside the tower of a hundred Supremes, everyone was watching.</p><p>“What’s going on? Who was it? Why are you on the fifth floor for so long?”</p><p>“It’s the person who came with Chu zhongxuan. I don’t know his name, but I guess he can only reach the fifth level at most. That’s why he was stuck there for so long.”</p><p>if you can’t pass, then come down earlier. There are other people who need to go in. Don’t waste their time!</p><p>At this moment, there were others who had just arrived and snorted coldly.</p><p>“Boring!”</p><p>Wang Kong curled his lips contemptuously. Just as he was about to leave, his eyes moved.</p><p>The others were also stunned. Because of this, the sixth level of the tower of a hundred Supremes suddenly shone.</p><p>Lu Ming had reached the sixth level.</p><p>“After enduring for so long, he’s finally reached the sixth floor. I guess the sixth floor is his limit.”</p><p>“I bet he’ll be ejected from the sixth floor in less than a minute …”</p><p>But before he could finish, he stopped abruptly.</p><p>That was because the seventh level had also lit up.</p><p>It had only been a few breaths since the sixth floor had lit up, and the seventh floor had already lit up. Those people under the tower of a hundred Supremes couldn’t help but open their mouths.</p><p>The few people who said that Lu Ming’s limit was the sixth level and that he would be ejected in less than a minute were so ashamed that their faces turned red.</p><p>This face-smacking was too fast.</p><p>The seventh floor was already the highest floor that Wang Kong had reached, and now, someone else had reached it.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Wang Kong stepped back and stared at the tower of a hundred Supremes.</p><p>The seventh floor stopped again. The eighth floor did not light up for a long time, and no one came out.</p><p>In the tower of a hundred Supremes, Lu Ming felt that he had trained enough on the fifth level and once again unleashed the Thunder mentality. He fused the three types of mentality and instantly defeated the green ring, entering the sixth level.</p><p>The intent realm of the sixth level was equivalent to the peak of a second-grade Minister. Lu Ming only needed a few breaths to defeat it and ascend to the seventh level.</p><p>Therefore, the time it took for the sixth and seventh floor to light up was only a few breaths.</p><p>The seventh level had a complete level-two concept.</p><p>A long Lightning Spear formed by lightning shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>He was fast and ruthless. He appeared in front of Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the three concepts to resist the lightning Spear.</p><p>This time, the battle lasted for more than ten minutes.</p><p>haha, my Thunder concept has finally reached the completion of the second level’s initial stage!</p><p>In the process of the fierce battle with the lightning Spear, Lu Ming had an epiphany and cultivated the Thunder concept to the peak of the second level beginner.</p><p>The power of the fusion of the three intents increased again, and it destroyed the lightning Spear in one fell swoop.</p><p>7th level, passed.</p><p>Lu Ming passed through the door of light and stepped into the eighth level.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped onto the eighth level, the eighth level of the tower of a hundred Supremes lit up.</p><p>Under the tower, everyone could not help but widen their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually reached the eighth level.</p><p>Terrifying. In that case, Lu Ming’s comprehension of intent realm had already surpassed that of Luan Xiongfei and Wang Kong.</p><p>amazing. Lu Ming is indeed amazing! Chu zhongxuan secretly praised.</p><p>Hmph, intent realm doesn’t represent all of one’s combat power. Although this person’s intent realm is not bad, his combat power might not be that strong.</p><p>Wang Kong coldly snorted.</p><p>No one said a word. They knew that Wang Kong had been surpassed and were unhappy. They just raised their heads and looked at the tower of a hundred Supremes.</p><p>Would he be able to charge to the ninth level?</p><p>They couldn’t help but look forward to it.</p><p>The eighth level of intent was the peak of the complete level two. Lu Ming had three types of intent and was no match for it. Therefore, he unleashed the earth intent.</p><p>As soon as the earth intent was used, the four intents combined and crushed him.</p><p>Lu Ming ascended to the ninth level.</p><p>“The ninth level is lit up!”</p><p>someone has reached the ninth level. Amazing, amazing. As long as he performs well on the ninth level, he might be able to get a token that leads to a higher cultivation Holy Land!</p><p>the ninth level is extremely difficult to pass. We have to do our best. The better we perform, the more likely we’ll be able to get the token.</p><p>At the bottom of the tower, everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared at the top of the tower, at the ninth level.</p><p>Let’s see when someone will be ejected.</p><p>The intent of the ninth level had not been raised to the third level. If it had been raised to the third level, there would be no need to compare. A third-level intent could completely crush a second-level intent.</p><p>Nine combat swords appeared on the ninth floor.</p><p>Blue, red, gold …</p><p>It was actually the nine commonly seen intents. Each of them condensed into a combat sword and stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The nine combat swords formed a sword array.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The four intents fused and formed a four-colored battle suit on Lu Ming’s body. It covered his entire body and even his face. At the same time, he wielded a long spear and attacked with terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the mentalities that appeared in the tower of a hundred talents were the nine common mentalities. Therefore, those who cultivated special mentalities would have an advantage here. This was because special mentalities were more powerful and mysterious.</p><p>For example, the earth concept was the strongest of Lu Ming’s four concepts. When it was combined with the other three concepts, the power that erupted was also the most terrifying.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sounds of collision rang out continuously.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A combat sword condensed from the will of mountain was first defeated by Lu Ming. After one combat sword was defeated, the power of the remaining eight wills was much weaker. Then, one combat sword after another was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Soon, all nine combat swords were defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>A door of light appeared in front of the platform.</p><p>“Is that the entrance to the tenth floor?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>According to Chu zhongxuan, it was very difficult for ordinary people to pass the ninth level. It was already not bad to be able to make it to the ninth level and even persist for a period of time.</p><p>On the ninth level, nine types of commonly seen wills condensed into nine combat swords, forming a sword array. Furthermore, they were all at the completion of level two. An ordinary person would not be able to pass it.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one who had fused four intents and a powerful earth intent that could pass.</p><p>Then, what would be on the tenth floor?</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and stepped into the door of light.</p><p>Outside the tower, when Lu Ming stepped into the door of light that led to the tenth level, all the lights on the ninth level suddenly went out.</p><p>All the lights in the tower were extinguished.</p><p>the light is gone. That person has failed!</p><p>They did not know Lu Ming’s name.</p><p>“That’s not right, why isn’t he out yet? Usually, after failing, you’ll be ejected. You wouldn’t have died inside, right?”</p><p>I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of anyone in the tower of a hundred Supremes dying.</p><p>“I’m waiting!”</p><p>However, an hour had passed in the blink of an eye and Lu Ming had not come out. Two hours later, Lu Ming had not come out.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a day had passed but Lu Ming had not come out.</p><p>Everyone was speechless. What was going on? did he really die inside? However, the others wanted to go in but couldn’t. This meant that there were still people inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
