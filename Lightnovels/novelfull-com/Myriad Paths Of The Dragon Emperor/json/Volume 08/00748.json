In the end, dozens of them had died, and the rest were surrounded by Lu Ming’s group of four. This scene was destined to be a big joke in the East continent.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and Luan Zhan all had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>They could not wait to turn Lu Ming and the other three into ashes.</p><p>They knew that after today, they would definitely become a laughingstock and would be looked down upon by the other top 1000 talents. They might even lose in the competition between their families.</p><p>In each of the six great ancient families, they weren’t the only chosen. Each of them had to bravely step forward, trampling over the other chosen before they could take control of the ancient family.</p><p>However, if today’s situation were to spread out, they would probably not have another chance.</p><p>How could they not hate him? how could they not be angry?</p><p>“Jiang Taixu, what’s wrong? You guys aren’t going to make a move? If that’s the case, you guys won’t be able to get first place.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I swear that from now on, there will be no place for you in the East barren!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>ha-ha, Jiang Taixu, don’t flatter yourself. Do you think the Jiang family will send their elders to stand up for you after your performance today? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Jiang Taixu gritted his teeth. He knew that Lu Ming was right.</p><p>He could only use his own energy if he wanted to find trouble with Lu Ming.</p><p>“However, I don’t want to just let it go like this!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. I’ll definitely take back the lives of the golden sword sect’s nine disciples. Today, I’ll definitely kill you!</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re only relying on your speed to escape. Do you dare to fight me head-on?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu sneered.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, his long hair flying in the wind and his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>Just now, he had successfully weakened the strength of Jiang Taixu and the others. Now, it was time for a head-on battle.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave the Wang family to me. I’ll hold them back!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure moved and appeared in front of Wang Jue and the others.</p><p>“Miss Xie, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Jian feiliu appeared beside Xie nianqing, intending to assist her.</p><p>“Brother Kong, how about delaying the chaotic family?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Kong Jin.</p><p>“Haha, leave it to me. I’ll let them know how powerful I am!”</p><p>Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>Lu Ming could not see through Kong Jin. He felt that it was extremely powerful and gave him a sense of danger. There were very few people of the same level that could give Lu Ming a sense of danger.</p><p>Although Luan Zhan was strong, he was not one of the top ten Heavenly Kings from the last Heavenly King Competition. He was ranked 602nd on the list of top 1000 talents, which was slightly weaker than Jiang Taixu and Wang Jue. Kong Jin should be able to stall for a while.</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, was facing Jiang Taixu and the other Jiang family experts alone. He wanted to kill Jiang Taixu.</p><p>The others in the outside world were also extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were going to take the initiative and attack aggressively.</p><p>It was unbelievable. One had to know that the peak-tier King tiers of the three great families were all experts. Some of them were existences that could compete for the top 108, but they actually wanted to launch an attack with only four people.</p><p>This had never happened before in history.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Even spirit embryo realm experts like Dongfang Hao and enlightened three corpse revealed looks of anticipation.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing made the first move, and the sky demon force field enveloped Wang Jue and the others.</p><p>The Wang clan only had six people left.</p><p>However, they were all experts.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Wang Jue shouted.</p><p>The six men from the Wang family were like six blazing Suns, trying to break through the demonic power field and rush toward Xie nianqing.</p><p>However, in the sky demon power field, a terrifying cutting power burst out. Other than Wang Jue, it was extremely difficult for others to break it.</p><p>With a dazzling golden light, Jian feiliu rushed into the sky demon power field. He didn’t attack Wang Jue, but kept wandering in the sky demon power field. The sharp sword light kept stabbing at the other five people, hindering their movements.</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, he used the sky demon hand to attack Wang Jue. Wang Jue was at a disadvantage and was suppressed by Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Haha, watch me, heaven suppressing demonic axe!”</p><p>Kong Jin laughed loudly. His fat body actually swelled up again. The battle-ax in his hand, which was as big as a door, madly chopped toward the members of the Luan family.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Kong Jin stepped in the air, causing the space to tremble. Each of his axe strikes seemed to be able to split open the sky and destroy everything.</p><p>“Eight rebellious slashes!”</p><p>In chaotic battle, he displayed the ultimate technique of the Luan family. One strike after another, and finally, eight strikes converged into one strike, which collided with the battle-ax that had advanced.</p><p>However, the moment they clashed, Luan Zhan’s saber trembled violently and almost exploded. His body was sent flying back like a cannonball, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Luan Zhan, who was ranked 602nd on the list of top 1000 talents, spat out a mouthful of blood after being hit by Kong Jin’s axe.</p><p>earth concept and shattering concept!</p><p>Luan Zhan shouted in disbelief.</p><p>Kong Jin had actually cultivated two extremely terrifying mentalities, the earth mentality and the shattering mentality. Moreover, both of them were at the second level and had been successfully fused.</p><p>How terrifying was it to have two special intents successfully fused together?</p><p>“Haha, die!”</p><p>Kong Jin wielded a battleaxe the size of a door and charged toward the Luan family.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Kong Jin killed several people in a row, and no one could stop him.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>Chaotic battle roared.</p><p>The Heavenly King stele world was a pure martial arts world. They couldn’t even form a battle formation. They could only gather everyone’s power to fight against the void.</p><p>Nearly 30 Masters of the chaotic family attacked at the same time, and dozens of attacks poured toward Kong Jin.</p><p>“Nest, there are too many people. It’s not easy to fight!”</p><p>The air advance battle axe was waved, forming an iron wall to block the attack. The fat on his body trembled non-stop.</p><p>They would then look for an opportunity to counterattack. The members of the Luan family did not dare to be distracted. They could only gather together and attack Kong Jin continuously. Otherwise, Kong Jin would seize the opportunity to counterattack and kill one of them.</p><p>The Wang clan and the Luan clan were both held back.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s expression turned even uglier.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not waste any more time. He strode forward, and his aura burst out one after another.</p><p>In the end, four kinds of intent surrounded his body, raising his aura to the limit.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted. With him as the leader, the remaining dozen or so Jiang family experts joined forces and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>suppress the heavens and earth! I’m invincible!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and used the prison suppressing heavenly art to strike out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A dazzling light flashed. The joint attack of the Jiang family was actually dispersed by Lu Ming’s palm. Lu Ming advanced again and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An old man’s palm collided with Lu Ming’s. He let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu cried out in disbelief.</p><p>“Last time, I didn’t use my full strength and you managed to escape. This time, you will die!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and continuously struck out with his palms.</p><p>The last time, Lu Ming had only used two intents-wind and thunder. This time, he had used all four intents. Lu Ming’s combat strength had reached its peak.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two more elders were split into pieces by Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
