One of them was ranked 420th and he was extremely strong.</p><p>In addition, there were still eight young experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Although fatty had successfully broken through during this period of time and reached the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, he was still not a match for them and was injured by so many people joining hands.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the cave’s entrance was narrow and could only allow one person to attack at a time, fatty wouldn’t have been able to block it at all.</p><p>He had already been here for two days and two nights. The chaotic family took turns to attack him, and his injuries were getting more and more serious. But he couldn’t fall. For Tingting, he couldn’t fall.</p><p>Outside the cave, the elites of the Luan family surrounded the cave with cold eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen one of them before. He was Luan Xiongfei, ranked 432nd on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>The other person was called chaotic Tianhao, ranked 420th.</p><p>“Fatty, I advise you not to put up any unnecessary resistance, or else you’ll suffer!”</p><p>Luan Xiongfei said coldly.</p><p>I’ve already said that when I received the inheritance, there was a restriction. I can’t pass it on to anyone else. Once I do, my soul will explode. Even if you want it, I can’t give it to you!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s voice could be heard from the cave.</p><p>hehe, of course, we know this. However, as long as you return to the Luan family with us, we will naturally have a way to extract the inheritance from your soul!</p><p>Luan Xiongfei sneered.</p><p>“Do you think I’m stupid? If you’re not careful, your soul will be destroyed. Even if you’re lucky, you’ll end up with an idiotic ending!”</p><p>Kong Jin shouted angrily.</p><p>“Hehe, that will depend on her own luck!” Luan Xiongfei sneered.</p><p>“A God-grade cultivation technique is so precious that it’s not something you can control. You’d better obediently follow me to my house!”</p><p>Luan Tianhao said coldly.</p><p>“Dream on! If you have the ability, come up and fight me, and see how I chop you up with my axe!”</p><p>Kong Jin roared like an injured beast, and a wild aura filled the air.</p><p>Not far from the cave, many people were watching, but no one came forward to say a word.</p><p>What a joke, who would dare to interrupt and interfere in the affairs of an ancient family?</p><p>He could only blame his bad luck for being targeted by an ancient family.</p><p>“You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Luan Xiongfei’s killing intent exploded.</p><p>This damn fatty was even more difficult to deal with than they had imagined. He had actually blocked the entrance of the cave. It had already been two days. They had taken turns to attack, but they could not break through the Fatty’s defense.</p><p>If it wasn’t for this cave, fatty wouldn’t have been able to withstand many of their attacks with his injured body.</p><p>“Fatty, forget it. Just hand me over to them!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes welled up with tears as she looked at Fatty’s bloodied body.</p><p>She didn’t want to mess up her family. She wasn’t willing to do so. She hadn’t avenged her parents yet, but the power of the ancient family was too strong. What could she do?</p><p>“Don’t say anymore. That’s impossible unless I die!”</p><p>Kong Jin’s tone was firm.</p><p>Ruan Tingting sighed. At this moment, she really hated herself for being useless.</p><p>“If you want to die, I’ll grant you your wish!”</p><p>Luan Xiongfei strode forward and rushed toward the cave.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>The fatty grinned, and his eyes revealed a fierce light. He raised his battle-axe and began to fight with Luan Xiongfei.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying Qi shot out in all directions, but there were marks on the stone walls of the cave that glowed. All the Qi shot out was like a stone sinking into the ocean.</p><p>The two of them exchanged over a hundred moves. After that, Luan Xiongfei retreated, his face dark.</p><p>This Fatty’s battle strength was simply too strong, and his endurance was also too strong. He actually couldn’t break through his heavily injured body.</p><p>“Hahaha, Luan Xiongfei, Luan Tianhao, you can’t even deal with a heavily injured person. How about this? leave this place to our Jiang clan. What do you think?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud laugh could be heard as more than ten figures stepped through the air.</p><p>When he saw who had arrived, Luan Tianhao’s expression changed, and he said in a deep voice, ” “Jiang Taiyou, is that you? What is the Jiang family doing here?”</p><p>Luan Tianhao, a God-tier cultivation technique has appeared, and everyone has a share. You Luan clan can’t be thinking of keeping it for yourselves, right? ”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou smiled faintly.</p><p>“You guys also want a God-grade cultivation technique? We, the Luan family, found that girl first.”</p><p>Luan Tianhao said with a cold expression.</p><p>“So what if you found it first? I gave you a few days and you still can’t settle it. Who can you blame? It’s our Jiang family’s turn!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou said with a smile.</p><p>Luan Tianhao and Luan Xiongfei had unsightly expressions on their faces.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou was ranked 419th on the list of top 1000 talents, one rank higher than Luan Tianhao. Moreover, there were two other geniuses among the Jiang family’s people. There were three geniuses in total, and they were not weaker than them at all. In fact, they might even be stronger.</p><p>The two sides were instantly at daggers drawn.</p><p>“How about this, we’ll bring that little girl back first and let the elders of the two families discuss it, what do you think?”</p><p>Luan Xiongfei said.</p><p>“Alright, I have no objections!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou said.</p><p>I don’t have any objections either. Now, it’s your Jiang family’s turn to attack. As long as you can get rid of that fatty, everything will be easy! Luan Tianhao said, nodding.</p><p>They reached an agreement.</p><p>At the entrance of the cave, fatty grinned.</p><p>In the cave, ruan Tingting’s eyes were filled with despair and her face became even paler.</p><p>It was obvious that she had been injured before, and it was not a light injury.</p><p>“Let me kill this fatty!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou strode forward, his eyes like lightning.</p><p>“Let’s see who you’ll behead.”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice sounded out, and an enormous force field descended with a loud bang.</p><p>Xie nianqing stepped through the air.</p><p>“Little Qing, quickly leave!”</p><p>The Fatty’s expression changed as he shouted.</p><p>Xie nianqing was definitely no match for the Jiang family and the Luan family, the six prodigies, and more than a dozen young experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Shut up! Mind your own business!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted. He did not stop as he stepped forward. His body was surrounded by a black light. His black dress fluttered in the wind, making him look like a demoness.</p><p>“What a beautiful girl! It’s not bad to bring her back as a concubine!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s eyes lit up with a hint of passion.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, Jiang Taiyou moved. Like a peerless divine weapon, he broke through the sky demon force field and charged towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said softly. In the sky demon force field, the space twisted and a terrifying cutting force exploded.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s expression changed suddenly. His body glowed with black light and he slashed forward like a divine weapon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s arm collided with the destructive cutting power, making a sound of gold and iron colliding and sending sparks in all directions.</p><p>“Interesting, but you’re still far from being able to stop me with this!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s eyes glowed and his body suddenly moved. It was as if he had transformed into a sword, a slender sword of assassination, a sword of a poisonous snake, and he began to swim in the sky demon power field.</p><p>The sharp sound of something breaking through the air resounded through the sky.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Jiang family’s immemorial divine weapon technique was extremely wonderful and could refine people into divine weapons.</p><p>The sword Qi was extremely sharp, breaking through the demonic force field and cutting through the destructive force. It was headed for Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
