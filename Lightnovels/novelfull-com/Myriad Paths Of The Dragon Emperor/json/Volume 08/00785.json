He was worried that something had happened to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chu zhongxuan, who is this man who came with you?”</p><p>Wang Kong’s eyes turned to Chu zhongxuan, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“He is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Chu zhongxuan said after a moment of silence. It was just a name, there was nothing to hide.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Who is it?”</p><p>“You don’t even know Lu Ming? it seems like you’ve been in seclusion for too long. I heard that the first place on the Heavenly King ranking this year is called Lu Ming.”</p><p>“So it’s him!”</p><p>Some of the people at the scene had heard of Lu Ming’s name before, while some had not.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>Wang Kong’s eyes were even sharper, as if there were flames burning in them.</p><p>Of course, he had heard of Lu Ming. During the battle of the Heavenly King List, several of the Wang family’s elites had died, and they were all killed by him.</p><p>“I’d like to see what’s going on with this hundred venerated Pagoda. How many days can you stay in there?”</p><p>Wang Kong sneered. He appeared on a huge rock not far away and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming himself was a little surprised.</p><p>When he stepped through the door of light and appeared on the tenth floor, he discovered that there were two old men sitting cross-legged on the tenth floor.</p><p>The two old men were dressed in gray robes, and they did not seem to be emitting any aura at all. They were just like two ordinary old men.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not really think that they were two ordinary elders. It was impossible for ordinary elders to be here.</p><p>The only possibility was that the other party’s cultivation was so deep that he could not sense it at all.</p><p>When Lu Ming appeared, the two elders ‘gazes fell on him, and they looked surprised.</p><p>interesting. He has comprehended four kinds of intent and has successfully merged them. This is very rare!</p><p>One of the old men said.</p><p>it’s more than rare. I’ve never seen anyone who has fused four wills and can still cultivate to the second level. Well, I’ve seen someone who has fused three wills!</p><p>Another old man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the junior generation greets the two seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Eh? Not bad, little guy!”</p><p>One of them nodded.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask what the test for the tenth floor is?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Assessment? No, you’ve already passed all of them, but since you’ve reached the tenth floor, we two old guys can’t not show our appreciation!”</p><p>The eyes of the old man on the left lit up as soon as he finished speaking. It was as if two Balls of Fire were burning. In the next moment, endless flames enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He released four intents and shouted at the same time, ” “Senior, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>kid, it’s good for you to resist with only fire concept!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. These two elders were unfathomable. It would be easy for them to kill him. Why did they have to do this? From the old man’s tone, there seemed to be another reason.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming kept the other three concepts and only used the fire concept to resist.</p><p>When the flames controlled by the elder surrounded Lu Ming, he did not feel the slightest bit of heat. Instead, he felt very comfortable.</p><p>He felt as if he was bathing in the fire concept, and the various changes of the fire concept appeared before his eyes.</p><p>the fire mentality has such a transformation. Amazing, it’s really amazing. Why didn’t I think of it? ”</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. He closed his eyes and began to comprehend.</p><p>His perception was completely immersed in the fire concept of the outside world. As for his own fire concept, it changed as he comprehended it.</p><p>“This kid has such strong comprehension!”</p><p>The eyes of the old man on the left lit up and he couldn’t help but praise.</p><p>his comprehension is indeed amazing. He has comprehended it so quickly. But it’s not surprising. To be able to successfully merge four kinds of intent and cultivate to this realm, even if he had a great encounter, his comprehension is absolutely amazing.</p><p>The old man on the right said.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming was immersed in cultivation. Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s fire concept suddenly became violent and powerful.</p><p>His fire concept had finally broken through to the second level lower tier.</p><p>three days to break through the bottleneck. Not bad, not bad!</p><p>The old man on the left nodded and put away his fire concept.</p><p>“Many thanks for senior’s help!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He knew that the old man had the intention to help him.</p><p>“Kid, don’t be happy too early. There’s more!”</p><p>The eyes of the elder on the right lit up. He opened his mouth and a strong wind blew. Endless wind concept enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and continued to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. Lu Ming’s concept of wind had also successfully broken through and reached level two lower tier.</p><p>kid, the two of us have only grasped these two intents. Consider it your reward for passing the level. You’ll have to comprehend the other intents on your own.</p><p>The old man on the right withdrew his wind concept and said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks to the two seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and thanked him again.</p><p>Oh, and this token. Take it. With your talent, you’re fully qualified to go to a higher Holy Land to cultivate!</p><p>The elder on the left took out a token and tossed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming received it and was overjoyed.</p><p>Wasn’t his purpose here for this token? Now, he had finally obtained it.</p><p>Lu Ming bowed again to express his gratitude.</p><p>“Mm, go!”</p><p>The elder on the right waved his hand and a powerful force acted on Lu Ming’s body. With a flash of light, Lu Ming realized that he had left the tower of a hundred Supremes and appeared in the air outside the tower. At the same time, the vital essence in his body was no longer suppressed and could be used freely.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core and landed on the ground.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming has come out!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually stayed in the tower of a hundred Supremes for six days and then appeared safe and sound. This was somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>In the past, even if someone cleared the level, they would only get a token, but no one stayed inside for six days.</p><p>On a huge rock not far away, Wang Kong opened his eyes. His eyes were like two Balls of Fire. He moved his body, and his hot breath spread toward Lu Ming. He suddenly landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you experience in there? Speak!”</p><p>Wang Kong asked, his tone filled with command. “What did I experience inside? What does it have to do with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and cast a glance at Wang Kong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s with your attitude? If I say it’s related to me, then it’s related to me. Also, did you get a token that leads to a higher cultivation Holy Land? hand it over!”</p><p>Wang Kong coldly rebuked.</p><p>“Idiot, get out of my way, you’re blocking the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless. Who did Wang Kong think he was?</p><p>Other people might be afraid of him, but Lu Ming had come so far. Who had he been afraid of?</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t think that you can be arrogant in front of me just because you’ve ranked first on the Heavenly King List and your will of heaven and earth is stronger. Let me tell you, the Heavenly King List is a joke in my eyes. Although you’ve passed the tower of a hundred talents, your will of heaven and earth can’t represent your combat power. I advise you to hand over the token obediently before I do anything to you!</p><p>Wang Kong’s eyes turned cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
