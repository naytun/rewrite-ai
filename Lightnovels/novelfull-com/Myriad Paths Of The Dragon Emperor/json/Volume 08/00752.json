They all sat cross-legged on the top seven steps.</p><p>They had half a month’s time to cultivate. After half a month, the Heavenly King monument would return to its ordinary state and lose its mysterious effects. It would only open again after three years.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming’s fire concept broke through in one go and reached beginner level two.</p><p>Then, he turned to comprehend the essence of the earth.</p><p>It was much more difficult to cultivate the essence of the earth. Lu Ming spent ten days before he managed to break through to level two.</p><p>Since then, Lu Ming’s four concepts of heaven and earth had all broken through to level two.</p><p>He had met the requirements to enter the spirit sea realm. Lu Ming could enter the spirit sea realm at any time.</p><p>At this time, 13 days had passed, and there were only two days left.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to continue comprehending the earth mentality in the next two days. The earth mentality was the most difficult to cultivate, so Lu Ming had to seize this opportunity.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. His earth mentality had also made some progress and had reached the middle stage of the second level.</p><p>Half a month’s time was almost up.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a message rushed into Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He thought about it carefully and was overjoyed.</p><p>The information that rushed into Lu Ming’s mind was actually a secret skill.</p><p>The secret skill was called super spirit sea!</p><p>That’s right, the name was super spirit sea.</p><p>According to the information inside, if a sea of soul realm martial artist cultivated this secret technique, the area of their sea of soul would be twice as large as others.</p><p>The spiritual ocean of the spiritual ocean realm was twice as large as others, which meant that the storage of true essence was twice as strong as others, and thus, the battle power was naturally stronger.</p><p>He had heard before that the first place on the Heavenly King ranking would have special rewards that could be obtained from the Heavenly King monument. Some were martial arts techniques, some were cultivation methods, and some were secret skills.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained a secret skill.</p><p>This was also the reason why Jiang Taixu and the others were so determined to fight for the first place.</p><p>With a secret technique like the Super spirit sea, he would have an advantage among the elites of the spirit sea realm.</p><p>haha, good. My genuine Yuan is already much stronger than ordinary people. With the Super spirit sea secret skill, my advantage will be even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily in his heart.</p><p>Although the six great ancient clans also cultivated God-grade cultivation techniques, each God-grade cultivation technique specialized in a different direction.</p><p>For example, after cultivating the Wang family’s sky-burning flame technique, one’s true energy would be like Heavenly Fire, capable of burning everything. However, the density of the true energy was definitely not as high as the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique leaned towards rich true essence.</p><p>The combination of the Super spirit sea and the true war Dragon technique was a perfect match.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt that the Heavenly King stele’s illusionary shadow above his head had disappeared. He could no longer feel any pressure or artistic conception. The time was up and the Heavenly King stele had returned to its ordinary state.</p><p>At this moment, everyone on the stairs opened their eyes.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Wang Jue and the rest took a glance at Lu Ming and the others before they hurriedly flew away, as if afraid that Lu Ming would attack them.</p><p>The corpse King and the rest of the heavenly corpse sect also stood up and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how’s the harvest?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>yes. Lu Ming nodded and asked, ” have you made a breakthrough in your concepts? ”</p><p>“I’ve broken through. Next, I’ll be breaking through to the spiritual ocean tier.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Haha, I’m also going to break through to the spiritual ocean tier!” Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>“I’m also planning to break through to the spirit ocean realm!”</p><p>Jian feiliu also said.</p><p>This time, many people had made great progress. After the battle of the Heavenly King List, many people would probably choose to break through to the sea of soul realm, such as Wang Jue and the corpse King.</p><p>After all, the war of Providence was getting closer and closer. There was only a year and three months left.</p><p>The battle of karmic luck was the key.</p><p>“Alright, let’s find a place to break through then!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Right now, he had almost accumulated enough Supreme-grade spirit crystals. He had to break through to the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Only by breaking through to the spiritual ocean tier would he be able to compete with those top talents on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>The four of them rose into the air and flew away.</p><p>The four of them did not fly toward the city, but toward the wilderness.</p><p>“I say, brother-in-law, what good stuff did you get on the top step?”</p><p>Kong Jin’s eyes sneaked a glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fatty, you’re not allowed to call him brother-in-law, and you’re also not allowed to call me little sister. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite.”</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and looked at Kong Jin with a dark expression.</p><p>Kong Jin shivered and said, ” “There’s no need to do this! If I call you that, isn’t it just to make you feel closer? if I don’t call you that, what else can I do?”</p><p>“Whatever you want, call me by my name!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Alright, alright!” Fatty Kong Jin pulled a long face. He then looked at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, you haven’t told me what good stuff you got.”</p><p>“It’s indeed a good thing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not hide anything. He said,”It’s a secret technique that can double the area of the spirit ocean after cultivating it in the spirit ocean realm!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu were both shocked.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, look … You and I are family, can you share it with us?” Kong Jin looked at Lu Ming sneakily and said.</p><p>“Sure, use crystals to buy it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Crystals? I don’t have many crystals. How about this, I’ll give you the raw stone!”</p><p>Kong Jin pondered for a moment. A bag appeared in his hand and he threw it to Lu Ming. there are 100 raw gemstones inside. Do you think that’s enough? ”</p><p>“Raw gemstones? you have that many raw gemstones?”</p><p>Other than Xie nianqing, Lu Ming and Jian feiliu widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>Orirocks were similar to spiritual crystals in that they contained massive amounts of energy.</p><p>However, the energy in the raw gemstones was not the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth in the spiritual crystal, but the original Qi of heaven and earth. The original Qi was purer and more advanced than spiritual Qi.</p><p>The amount of energy consumed by a warrior at the spiritual ocean tier and above was too terrifying. If they used Supreme-grade spirit crystals, it would be tens of millions or even hundreds of millions. The higher the tier, the more terrifying it would be.</p><p>However, it would be different if he used raw gemstones. Raw gemstones were extremely advanced and could be quickly converted into vital essence. A low-grade raw gemstones were worth millions of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>The fatty gave Lu Ming 100 low-grade raw stones, which were worth hundreds of millions of Supreme spiritual crystals.</p><p>One had to know that normal spiritual ocean tier Warriors didn’t have any raw gemstones. Usually, only martial artists at the higher stages of the spiritual ocean tier and above had raw gemstones, and would use them to cultivate.</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the rough stone and took out three Jade cards. He engraved the information of the Super spirit sea into the Jade cards and then threw one to Kong Jin.</p><p>This time, the few of them had experienced a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming had already regarded Kong Jin as a friend. Although the Super spirit sea secret skill was precious, he would not be stingy with it.</p><p>Then, he gave the other two Jade tokens to Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
