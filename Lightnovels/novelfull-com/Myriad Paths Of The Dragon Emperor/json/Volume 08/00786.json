They knew that Wang Kong was going to snatch Lu Ming’s token.</p><p>...</p><p>It was up to Lu Ming to deal with it.</p><p>Chu zhongxuan wanted to say something, but he hesitated. He wanted to speak up for Lu Ming, but the Wang family was powerful. If he stepped in, he might get himself into trouble. He pondered for a while and did not say anything in the end.</p><p>“Get lost, good dogs don’t block the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming had completely lost his patience. His expression turned cold and he berated coldly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wang Kong’s eyes turned completely cold. His body was covered in blazing flames. The terrifying temperature twisted the space.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He took a step forward, his hand was like a heavenly blade, and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming also struck out with his palm, activating the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Their palms met and a buzzing sound was heard. Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly while Wang Kong took two steps back. The rocks where his feet stepped on were vaporized by the terrifying temperature, leaving two dark holes.</p><p>“A battle in the air!”</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and appeared high in the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wang Kong’s killing intent surged, and the temperature of his body became even more terrifying.</p><p>He circulated the Wang family’s sky-burning flame art to the extreme. At the same time, his Extreme Purple Heavenly Fire bloodline burst out, making Wang Kong look like he was about to turn into a ball of fire.</p><p>His aura was many times stronger than Wang Jue’s when he was still a peak King tier.</p><p>Wang Kong’s cultivation was also at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>raging flames burning the heavens! Burning extermination slash!</p><p>A saber appeared in Wang Kong’s hand. The saber was also covered in flames of terrifying temperature.</p><p>“What is this? The fire concept has evolved, the burning concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Wang Kong’s talent was indeed worthy of being ranked 430th on the list of top 1000 talents. He had actually evolved his fire mentality into the more terrifying burning mentality.</p><p>The essence realm of heaven and earth was not always the same.</p><p>It didn’t mean that just because one had comprehended the concept of fire, it was the concept of fire.</p><p>Some geniuses with terrifying talent could achieve evolution on the basis of this intent realm and evolve into an even more terrifying intent realm.</p><p>As for what kind of intent realm they could evolve into, everyone was different, and it would depend on themselves.</p><p>For example, the nine common intents might seem to be the weakest, but they also had the most infinite possibilities.</p><p>For example, the fire concept could evolve into countless types of concepts related to fire. Many of these concepts were extremely powerful and far surpassed the fire concept itself.</p><p>The burning concept was one of the types of concepts that had evolved after the fire concept.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying saber gleam slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded four different intents, which merged with the prison suppressing heaven technique. He threw a palm at Wang Kong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there was a terrifying roar. The clouds were torn apart, and five-colored lights filled the entire sky.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s figure only swayed a little, while Wang Kong took nine steps back.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Wang Kong’s eyes were filled with shock. He had already used all his strength, but he was still pushed back by Lu Ming’s palm. It was unbelievable.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite of the Wang family. The sky-burning flames skill he cultivated was a God-grade technique. In addition, his intent realm had evolved and he had comprehended the burning intent realm.</p><p>Furthermore, his bloodline martial technique was also extremely powerful. It was also a demigod-level martial technique.</p><p>It could be said that he had no shortcomings at all. In a battle of the same level, he was not afraid of anyone, except for a few extremely rare geniuses or divine level geniuses who had awakened divine bloodlines.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming was of a higher level and had defeated him.</p><p>When had he ever been forced to retreat by someone of a higher level?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>die! Wang Kong bellowed. The flames on his body roared as if they were going to burn the world.</p><p>“Is there any use in shouting?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and swung his palm at Wang Kong.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two exchanged blows, and Wang Kong retreated again.</p><p>To be honest, Wang Kong was very strong. He was even stronger than Shangguan jinjue.</p><p>When Shangguan jinjue was facing Lu Ming, he was completely suppressed and killed in a few moves.</p><p>Wang Kong, on the other hand, was still able to block it, though he was also at a complete disadvantage.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a dozen moves, Wang Kong was completely suppressed. No matter how much he roared, it was useless.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Wang Kong was sent flying thousands of meters away by Lu Ming’s palm. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>Wang Kong roared and turned to leave, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. Wang Kong was strong, extremely strong. If he was determined to leave, Lu Ming would not be able to kill him unless he used the Dao of inscription and cooperated with him.</p><p>The surrounding people looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Wang Kong. Furthermore, he had defeated someone of a higher level. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>brother Lu is really amazing. I admire you!</p><p>Chu zhongxuan walked over, his face still filled with surprise.</p><p>“You’re welcome, brother Chu. I need to find a place to cultivate in seclusion, so I’ll take my leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left.</p><p>Some of them were left with a belly full of questions. They were guessing whether Lu Ming had obtained a token that led to a higher cultivation Holy Land.</p><p>After flying tens of thousands of miles, Lu Ming landed on a mountain peak. He entered the Supreme shrine and five to six storage rings appeared in his hand.</p><p>These storage rings were obtained from the enemies he had killed during this period of time, such as Shangguan jinjue and the others.</p><p>All of them were above the spiritual ocean tier, and there were even those at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. There was also Shangguan jinjue, a prodigy. The things inside were very rich.</p><p>Just the Supreme spiritual crystals alone were worth 800 million.</p><p>There were even dozens of middle-grade intent crystals, but they were of all sorts.</p><p>In addition, there were many martial arts, spirit weapons, and pills.</p><p>It was a pity that there were no raw gemstones. However, Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>Now, his four intents had all reached the peak of the second level. Even his Wind and Fire intents had reached the second level lower tier. He could continue to devour spiritual crystals to improve his cultivation.</p><p>However, 800 million spiritual crystals would not be much of an improvement. One should know that Lu Ming had consumed more than 800 million spiritual crystals in the process of breaking through to the spirit ocean realm from the martial King realm.</p><p>Furthermore, he had cultivated a super spirit sea. If Lu Ming wanted to increase his cultivation, the energy consumption would be even more terrifying.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang …</p><p>Piles of top-grade spirit crystals were devoured and Lu Ming began to refine them crazily.</p><p>100 million, 200 million …</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had refined 600 million out of the 800 million Supreme spiritual crystals. His cultivation had only risen to the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm. The remaining 200 million was not enough to break through to the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. Hence, Lu Ming did not continue devouring.</p><p>However, his cultivation had advanced to the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm, and it had also increased Lu Ming’s essential core by a large margin. In his spirit ocean, his essential core was surging.</p><p>At this moment, a spiritual herb appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It was a level 6 spiritual herb.</p><p>It had been a long time since Lu Ming cultivated his physical body. Now, it was time for him to cultivate properly.</p><p>He activated the ten thousand spiritual combat body and began to refine spirit herbs and cultivate his physical body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Lu Ming had refined more than twenty sixth-level spiritual herbs and improved his physical body to the perfected seventh-level in one go.</p><p>However, to break through to the eighth level, it was possible to do so with spirit herbs that were above the seventh level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
