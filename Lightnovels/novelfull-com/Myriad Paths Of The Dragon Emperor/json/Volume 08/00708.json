At this moment, seeing Xie nianqing and Lu Ming’s intimate behavior, jealousy appeared in his eyes. He shouted coldly, ” “Kid, Who are you? He’s my woman, get lost!”</p><p>...</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Chi Yue arrived.</p><p>“Chi Yue, is that you? How dare you trespass into the territory of the yin snake tribe! You’re courting death!”</p><p>Yin que’s eyes were filled with killing intent when he saw Chi Yue.</p><p>“Yin que!”</p><p>Seeing Yin que, Chi Yue’s face sank.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his head and looked at Yin que. A violent killing intent exploded from his body. He said in a cold voice, ” “Today, you must die!”</p><p>“Haha, kid, you think you can kill me? Brat, you dare to hold my woman? I will make you beg for death!”</p><p>Yin que sneered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the giant wolf puppet appeared, pouncing towards Yin que.</p><p>“A fourth-ranked divine Golem!”</p><p>Yin que’s expression changed slightly. With a wave of his hand, a giant snake puppet appeared. It was also a puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The two puppets collided with each other.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing in one hand and strode forward. A terrifying fist radiance burst forward.</p><p>Wherever the fist radiance passed, the valley would shake. The old vines around the valley exploded and some poisonous snakes were turned into powder.</p><p>Yin que’s expression changed, and a picture scroll appeared in his hand. After he unrolled it, a light shield appeared and enveloped Yin que within it. On the light shield, a few venomous snakes were slithering non-stop.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist radiance landed on the light shield, causing it to shake non-stop. However, it was not broken, and Yin que was sent flying.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>Yin que landed on the ground and took out another inscription scroll. He unfurled it and a giant snake that was dozens of meters long flew out, pouncing at Lu Ming.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared in his hand. He thrust the spear forward and a three-colored true dragon flew out to collide with the giant snake.</p><p>However, the three-colored true dragon was dispersed by the giant snake’s collision and continued flying toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. This was clearly a sixth level inscription scroll. Its power was equivalent to the attack of a fourth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Chi Yue controlled the cheetah puppet and pounced forward, clashing with the giant snake.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of air being torn rang out as elder kui arrived with the other six people.</p><p>“Elder kui, kill, kill that brat, and capture Chi Yue and that little bitch alive.”</p><p>Yin que shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Powerful mental energy spread out from the heads of elder kui and the others, forming a terrifying storm.</p><p>Giant snake puppets appeared in the air.</p><p>this is bad. That’s a tier five divine level inscriber. Lu Ming, let’s leave quickly!</p><p>Chi Yue’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Elder kui was equivalent to an inscriber at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He had lit up at least four blue Spirit lamps.</p><p>His puppet was also equivalent to the strength of the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Chi Yue, help me take care of little Qing. I must kill him today!”</p><p>Lu Ming put Xie nianqing down and pointed his spear at Yin que.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing was already fine and was standing behind Lu Ming.</p><p>“Haha, brat, you can’t even protect yourself, and you still want to kill me? you’re dreaming. I’ve changed my mind. Elder kui, capture him alive. I want him to suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>Yin que laughed out loud, his expression extremely malevolent.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Elder kui controlled the giant snake puppet and it pounced at Lu Ming. Its tongue was like a sword, piercing through space.</p><p>Chi Yue gritted his teeth and controlled the cheetah puppet to charge forward, but before he could even exchange two moves with the giant snake puppet, he was sent flying.</p><p>The other six people were also extremely powerful. The puppets they controlled were at least at the level of the spiritual ocean tier. There were even two giant snake puppets that were at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Chi Yue’s puppet was entangled by a puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, while the other giant snake puppets charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and there were traces of lightning swimming around. He was ready to control the lightning cauldron and launch a fatal attack.</p><p>“Ta!” …</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the giant wolf puppet to block in front of him. At the same time, he stomped on the ground frantically.</p><p>“Yayaya, watch me!”</p><p>Dandan landed on the ground and kept waving its claws.</p><p>OWW …</p><p>The giant wolf puppet was entangled by a giant snake. It kept howling and shooting sparks in all directions. That giant snake was elder kui’s puppet. It was too powerful. The giant wolf puppet let out a series of banging sounds and exploded continuously.</p><p>In the end, the giant wolf puppet was completely destroyed, becoming a pile of scrap metal.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. The inscription formation appeared and formed a large bow. An arrow shot towards Yin que like a shooting star.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Dandan waved her claws, and dense runes appeared. Countless vines appeared and wrapped around the five or six giant snake puppets, tightly binding them.</p><p>Yin que’s expression changed and he took out another inscription talisman scroll. After opening it, a combat sword flew out and clashed with Lu Ming’s arrow.</p><p>“Kill! Let’s use the inscription scroll together and kill that brat!”</p><p>Elder kui shouted coldly. An inscription talisman appeared in his hand, and so did the others.</p><p>As soon as he opened it, all kinds of attacks were launched at Lu Ming. There were swords, sabers, ice, storms, and so on.</p><p>All of them were attacks that were equivalent to the spiritual ocean tier and above. Some of them were even at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier and above. They were too powerful and Lu Ming could not possibly block them. He would be turned into dust in an instant.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing and Chi Yue both exclaimed.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold. His eyebrows suddenly glowed with a bright light. A large cauldron flew out, and lightning filled the air.</p><p>The moment the cauldron flew out, Lu Ming’s essential core was instantly sucked dry. Even his life essence was sucked away. Every time he used it, he would lose fifty years of his life.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care. He had to kill Yin que today.</p><p>The lightning cauldron rapidly grew in size as a fearsome might gushed forth from it. It was as if it could destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>At this moment, everyone felt the fear of facing the heavens.</p><p>“Retreat! Retreat!”</p><p>Elder kui’s pupils contracted as he retreated in a frenzy. Not only him, but everyone else also retreated in a frenzy. At the same time, runic scrolls appeared, and a light screen enveloped their bodies.</p><p>Especially Yin que, he opened all the inscription scrolls and at least seven light screens covered his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning cauldron descended and suppressed everything. Boundless lightning power descended, destroying all life.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Other than elder kui and Yin que, the other six people died instantly under the lightning cauldron.</p><p>Elder kui and Yin que were like leaves in the wind, constantly drifting. The light shield on Yin que’s body was constantly being destroyed. His face was full of fear, and it was twisted into a ball.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning cauldron fell and quickly shrunk. It flew back to Lu Ming’s glabella and disappeared.</p><p>The 10,000 snakes Valley was charred black. Whether it was the ancient trees, wild grass, or poisonous snakes, they were all charred black as if they had experienced a lightning tribulation.</p><p>Elder kui and Yin que spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They lay on the ground like two dead fish, unable to move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
