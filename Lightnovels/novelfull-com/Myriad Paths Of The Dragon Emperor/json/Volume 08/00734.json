However, Lu Ming still stood firmly. Following closely behind him was Xie nianqing. Xie nianqing’s eyes were extremely determined.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to see in Xie nianqing’s eyes that she was going to step on someone.</p><p>“It shouldn’t be me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled in his heart.</p><p>Wang mie’s eyes turned cold when he saw that both Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had reached the 16th step.</p><p>The rest of the people below were surprised as well. They did not expect Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu to be able to reach the 16th step.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Xie, I can’t keep going up with you!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said. Then he sat down cross-legged and started to cultivate.</p><p>if you can’t make it, you’d better not force yourself. Otherwise, it would be a joke if you die Here before the Heavenly King ranking even starts.</p><p>Wang mie looked at Lu Ming and sneered.</p><p>“Oh, really? This is what you told yourself, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You have a sharp tongue. I’d like to see if you can step on it!”</p><p>Wang mie coldly snorted and stepped forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wang mie’s foot landed heavily on the 17th step. Instantly, his body shook violently as if he was under a terrifying pressure.</p><p>But in the end, it was still blocked by him.</p><p>“He’s stopped, he’s stopped. Wang mie, he really can reach the 17th step!”</p><p>it’s said that the situation on the 17th step is completely different from the previous 16 steps. It’s even more terrifying. The 17th step is a threshold. Only those who can reach the 17th step can be considered a top genius.</p><p>When Wang mie stepped onto the 17th step, many people were moved, even though they had already expected it.</p><p>“Come on up!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked down at him with a smug expression.</p><p>Heaven’s pride experts were also divided into different levels. He had reached the 17th step. In terms of determination and potential, he could already be ranked among the top heaven’s pride experts. How could he not be proud?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His proud expression didn’t last long before it stiffened.</p><p>Xie nianqing took a step forward. He stepped on it steadily without even shaking.</p><p>you’re just a frog in a well. What’s there to be proud of on the 17th step? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing glanced at Wang mie with disdain.</p><p>Below, many people were dumbfounded. Xie nianqing’s actions were completely beyond their expectations.</p><p>They couldn’t help but reevaluate this beautiful woman. Xie nianqing had been quiet all this while, but now they knew that they had underestimated him.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Wang mie’s expression was extremely ugly. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”She’s her, what about you?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as Wang mie finished speaking, Lu Ming stepped forward and stood firmly on the 17th step. Wang mie’s expression was completely stiff.</p><p>“The 17 steps are indeed different!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze looked up.</p><p>In front of him, a figure as tall as the sky appeared. This figure exuded a terrifying pressure. This pressure was unparalleled, like the might of the heavens. Under this pressure, even one’s soul would tremble, and one wouldn’t be able to summon the slightest thought of resisting.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The giant figure spat out these three words like a Thunderbolt. It was supremely dignified and did not allow any resistance.</p><p>At the same time, all kinds of light fell on Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming could clearly feel that his body had been pierced through, and he was bleeding profusely.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to make me get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were firm and bright. He faced the huge figure fearlessly.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang mie let out a low roar.</p><p>At that moment, nine people on the 17th step opened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>These nine people were the ones who had reached the 17th step before him. There were old men, but most of them were young people, all of whom were extremely powerful.</p><p>“Interesting, a few more heaven’s chosen have arrived. Wang mie seems to be at a disadvantage.”</p><p>“Wang mie should have to stop here. But who’s that young man? I’ve never seen him before!”</p><p>it seems like he’s a new genius. I wonder if he can make it to the 18th step!</p><p>On the 17th step, a few young experts were discussing.</p><p>“It’s not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Without even looking at Wang mie, he lifted his foot and continued to step forward.</p><p>His determined footsteps landed on the 18th step. Lu Ming stepped on it steadily.</p><p>At that moment, the five figures who had been sitting cross-legged on the 18th step opened their eyes at the same time and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Wang mie shouted.</p><p>The rest of the people at the scene looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually reached the 18th step. It was too shocking and beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>There were only five people sitting cross-legged on the 18th step. They were all famous geniuses. Although they weren’t among the last ten Heavenly Kings, they were close to that level. Each of them was ranked above Wang mie on the list of top 1000 talents. Now, there was one more person.</p><p>Above them, on the 19th step, there was only one person, and that was Jiang Taixu.</p><p>The key was, was this Lu Ming’s limit? Could he go one step further and reach the 19th step to be on the same level as Jiang Taixu?</p><p>He was curious, extremely curious.</p><p>However, an even more shocking scene appeared. Xie nianqing also raised his foot and stepped onto the 18th step.</p><p>“Do you want to come up and try?”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming turned his head and looked down at Wang mie.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang mie’s eyes were extremely gloomy. His body was emitting hot flames, like a god of fire.</p><p>if you can’t make it, don’t force yourself. The Heavenly King ranking hasn’t started yet. If you die Here, you’ll be a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Wang mie almost vomited blood in anger. This was what he had said to Lu Ming just now. Now, Lu Ming returned it to him in its original form.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Wang mie’s eyes revealed a trace of ruthlessness. He let out a low roar and stepped onto the 18th step.</p><p>Instantly, his body trembled violently, and his eyes were filled with fear. He screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was directly sent flying, following in Wang Mang’s footsteps.</p><p>The 17th step was already Wang mie’s limit. If he had barely managed to climb up, this would have been the only result. It was already a good thing that he didn’t die.</p><p>The crowd only glanced at Wang mie casually and then looked at the two figures on the 18th step.</p><p>Could they still continue to go up?</p><p>Everyone was extremely curious.</p><p>However, to his disappointment, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Xie nianqing pondered for a moment, then sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
