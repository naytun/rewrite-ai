As long as we hand over Lu Ming and the woman, we can stabilize the yin snake tribe. Then, we can slowly think of a way to break the last thirty-six formations. This is the best plan!</p><p>...</p><p>“That’s right, what the pure gold Mountain elder said makes sense!”</p><p>An elder spoke out, supporting the pure gold Mountain’s statement.</p><p>This caused excitement to flash in the pure gold Mountain’s eyes.</p><p>“I object. Lu Ming is our clan’s benefactor. If we treat him this way and word gets out, what will others think of our clan? Also, the most important thing now is the awakening of the ancient ancestor. As long as we can stop the yin snake tribe’s attack, we’ll enter a period of peace. If Lu Ming can awaken the ancient ancestor, he’ll definitely value our tribe. That’s the foundation of our tribe’s rise.”</p><p>Chi Yue’s second uncle, Chi Jintian, said.</p><p>“That’s right, I also agree with second brother’s words!”</p><p>Chi jinkong said.</p><p>“Second brother, clan leader, you’ve overestimated Lu Ming. There are many extraterrestrials who have descended this time. How did you know that Lu Ming is the legendary chosen one? We can’t bet the fate of our race on this tiny possibility!”</p><p>right now, we have to deal with the yin snake tribe. The most important thing is to protect our tribe!</p><p>Pure gold Mountain shouted loudly, causing many people to nod their heads.</p><p>“What if I can destroy the yin snake tribe?”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice came from outside the hall, causing everyone’s heart to skip a beat. They couldn’t help but look outside the hall.</p><p>Three young figures walked in.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Chi Yue.</p><p>Lu Ming was the one who said those words just now.</p><p>“Yue ‘er, this is our clan’s meeting hall. How can you bring two outsiders in?”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain berated.</p><p>“It’s fine. Our clan is greatly indebted to Lu Ming. We can enter the discussion!” Chi jinkong waved his hand, causing Chi Jin Shan’s expression to turn ugly.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s face darkened as he looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, what did you just say? You can destroy the yin snake tribe?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re so full of yourself. You’re just a heaven-grade inscriber? Kid, do you know how strong the yin snake tribe is? Laughable, truly laughable!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain laughed loudly, revealing a mocking expression.</p><p>hehe, I remember that you said that I was talking big before. How could a mere Sky Realm break the seal formation? how did I break it in the end? ”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s face turned red. He had indeed said such words back then, but the truth had proven that his words were just nonsense.</p><p>Hmph, this is completely different from breaking the seal. The yin snake tribe is extremely powerful. There are dozens of tribes in the area. How can they be destroyed just like that? ”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain chided coldly.</p><p>“Of course I have my ways!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If you have a way, why don’t you say it out and let everyone see if your method is feasible?”</p><p>Chi Jinshan said.</p><p>“I can’t say it now. If I want to say it, I’ll only say it to the patriarch.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re clearly trying to stall for time by spouting nonsense. What can you do?”</p><p>Pure gold Mountain shouted.</p><p>“Because I don’t trust you!” Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“What? Kid, what do you mean by this? If you dare to slander me, I’ll kill you right now!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain roared.</p><p>alright, sixth brother, you can leave now. I believe in Lu Ming! At this moment, Chi jinkong spoke. His voice revealed an unquestionable meaning.</p><p>“I believe in Lu Ming too!”</p><p>“I also believe that!”</p><p>Chi Jintian and a few clan elders spoke one after another.</p><p>Chi jinkong and a few clan elders with the most authority all spoke, and the others immediately fell silent.</p><p>thank you for your trust, seniors. Clan leader, can you ask the others to leave? senior Jin Tian and the other clan elders can stay. I have a plan to destroy the yin snake tribe!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, you can all leave!” Chi jinkong waved his hand in an unquestionable manner.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s expression was extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth and could only retreat.</p><p>Soon, only Chi jinkong, Chi Jintian, and a few elders were left in the hall. Of course, Chi Yue and Xie nianqing were also there.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you have any way to exterminate the yin snake tribe?”</p><p>A look of hope flashed in Chi jinkong’s eyes.</p><p>He was satisfied as long as he could stop the yin snake tribe’s attack, let alone destroy them.</p><p>“Chief, if the yin snake tribe were to attack the red leopard tribe, would they attack from the sky or from the ground?”</p><p>Lu Ming gave an irrelevant answer.</p><p>“Of course we’ll attack from the ground. In the air, they’ll be covered by our arrows, and in the air, they can’t inscribe formations to defend. If they use inscription talismans all the time, they won’t be able to afford it.”</p><p>if we attack from the ground, we can cooperate with each other. One person will control the puppet, and the other will inscribe an inscription formation to block our arrows. At the same time, they can also shoot back arrows.</p><p>Chi jinkong explained.</p><p>“That’s good. If I have a way to cut off the connection between the yin snake tribe’s people and the puppets, do you have the confidence to defeat the yin snake tribe?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“What? Cut off the connection between the yin snake tribe’s people and the puppets?”</p><p>Chi jinkong’s eyes were burning with a fiery light.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>if that’s the case, our tribe will be able to annihilate the yin snake tribe with our puppet army!</p><p>Chi jinkong’s eyes were bright as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>If they could really annihilate the yin snake tribe, the red leopard tribe’s reputation would definitely soar, and their strength would also increase rapidly.</p><p>that’s good. I know of a formation that can cut off the connection between the enemy and the puppets once they enter the formation. As long as we set up the formation outside the ancient city, the yin snake tribe will be killed if they attack!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled confidently.</p><p>“There’s such a wondrous formation?”</p><p>Chi jinkong was shocked. He frowned and said, ” “If that’s the case, won’t our clansmen’s connection with the puppets be cut off if they charge in?”</p><p>it’s fine. I have a small puppet-controlling technique here. After using it, you can avoid being cut off from the puppet by that kind of formation. Moreover, this small technique is very easy to learn, and can be learned in a few hours.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade tablet and handed it to Chi jinkong. “The clan leader can teach this little technique to some of his confidants, but please don’t explain the use of this technique. It’ll be troublesome if word gets out.”</p><p>“Good, good, haha!”</p><p>Chi jinkong took it and laughed excitedly. The others were also excited.</p><p>“There’s no time to lose, I’ll go and inscribe the great inscription formation now. However, clan head, you’d better keep an eye on the pure gold Mountain elder.”</p><p>Lu Ming said as if he was implying something.</p><p>: Don’t worry, I know what to do.”Chi jinkong’s eyes flickered as he thought of something:</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left with Xie nianqing and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
