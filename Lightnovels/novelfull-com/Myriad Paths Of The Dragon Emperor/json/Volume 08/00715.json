Why are you doing this?”</p><p>...</p><p>Chi jinkong said.</p><p>“It’s simple. The yin snake tribe and the heavenly Wolf tribe gave me enough resources to break through a few levels. It’s enough for me to use for a few hundred years. What does the death of the previous clan leader have to do with me? What does the decline of the red leopard tribe have to do with me? It’s not like I’m going to inherit the position of clan leader, hahaha!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain laughed madly.</p><p>“Selfish, selfish! Tribal elders, take down pure gold Mountain and extinguish his spiritual fire. Bring him back to the tribe and execute him in public!”</p><p>Chi jinkong ordered.</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle. The few clan elders were all extremely powerful. Under their joint efforts, the pure gold Mountain had no chance of resisting. Not long after, it was taken down, its mental energy fire extinguished, and it was brought back to the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming was no longer concerned about what happened next. He focused on closed-door cultivation and waited for the underground world’s rest period before heading to the holy mountain.</p><p>In the underground world, there was a one-month period of rest every year, and half a month before and after the day of the ancient ancestor worship.</p><p>During the period of ceasefire, no tribe was allowed to wage war, and no one was allowed to kill the people of other tribes who passed by. If anyone violated this rule, they would be besieged by the other tribes and annihilated.</p><p>There was still about half a month before the rest period.</p><p>Like Lu Ming, Xie nianqing was cultivating in seclusion.</p><p>The battle of Providence was getting closer and closer, and he felt a sense of urgency.</p><p>It was said that the top 600 on the list of top 1000 talents were almost all sea of soul realm Warriors, and only a few of them were King’s realm Warriors.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were far from being able to compete with a spiritual ocean tier elite.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the Supreme shrine. He crushed the earth intent crystals one after another as he focused on increasing his Earth Force.</p><p>Seven days later, the force of the earth had reached perfection. Lu Ming used a middle-grade profound meaning crystal to break through to the next realm. He broke through in one go and condensed an intent rune.</p><p>The earth Force had successfully transformed into first level earth concept.</p><p>However, this was far from enough. If he wanted to display his powerful combat strength, he had to cultivate the earth will to the completion of level one.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate with the earth intent crystal. In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the intent of the profound meaning of the earth to level one lower tier.</p><p>&Nbsp; with such a terrifying increase, the number of intent crystals he had consumed was also enormous.</p><p>At this time, the underground world had finally reached a period of peace. The red leopard tribe was preparing to head to the holy mountain.</p><p>“Little Qing, how’s the harvest during this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked as he strolled with Xie nianqing in the courtyard.</p><p>the wind concept has broken through to the second level. This time, I’m faster than you, right? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes narrowed as he chuckled.</p><p>you broke through to level two? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Xie nianqing’s talent was indeed terrifying.</p><p>His Thunder, wind, and fire concepts were all stuck at the limit of the first level. He was only one step away from the second level, but he couldn’t break through.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Xie nianqing had already broken through to the second level.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s cultivation had already reached the peak-tier of the king realm. As long as his destruction intent broke through to the second level, he would be able to open his spirit sea and become a sea of spirit realm expert.</p><p>The spiritual ocean tier was known as the Almighty, and it was the first tier of the three spiritual divine tiers. It was not something that the king’s Tier could compare to, and was definitely a qualitative leap. However, who knew how many people had been trapped to death by this step?</p><p>The two of them chatted as they walked. After a while, they arrived at a large square outside.</p><p>There were already many people gathered here.</p><p>One after another, huge cheetah puppets stopped in the square.</p><p>“Lu Ming, miss Xie, you’re here. We’re about to set off.”</p><p>Chi Yue walked over and said with a smile.</p><p>This time, Chi jinkong personally led the team, along with two clan elders and more than 100 experts from the red leopard tribe. They were all heading to the holy mountain.</p><p>Chi Yue was also going with them.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a huge cheetah puppet appeared on the ground.</p><p>This cheetah puppet was equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. It was a gift from the red leopard tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing leaped onto the back of the cheetah puppet.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, let’s go!”</p><p>Chi jinkong ordered.</p><p>The cheetah puppet rose into the air and flew toward the North.</p><p>Like Lu Ming, there were more than a hundred people who came from the outer world. They headed to the holy mountain together to participate in the assessment.</p><p>The holy mountain was to the North of the red leopard tribe, separated by dozens of tribes of various sizes. The distance was quite far, so they could only rush without rest.</p><p>&Nbsp; no tribe stopped them on the way.</p><p>After 13 days of non-stop traveling, they finally arrived at the foot of the sacred mountain and set up camp there.</p><p>“What a magnificent mountain peak!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood at the foot of the mountain and looked ahead.</p><p>A huge and majestic mountain stood between the heaven and earth. It pierced straight into the sky, surrounded by clouds and mist.</p><p>The mountain covered a very wide area. At the foot of the mountain, one could see tribes after tribes that were clearly divided. Just like the red leopard tribe, they had set up camps. After two days, the outsiders would have to go up the mountain for the assessment.</p><p>Legend had it that the underground ancient ancestor lived on the peak of this mountain.</p><p>The people underground couldn’t climb the mountain. According to the legends, only those from the outer world could climb the mountain. After going through a test, the person who reached the top of the mountain would be able to awaken the ancient ancestor.</p><p>could this Saint mountain be the real location of the Martial Emperor’s treasure? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He believed that not only him, but most of the people from the outside world also thought so.</p><p>Time passed. In the blink of an eye, two days passed.</p><p>On this day, a dense crowd appeared around the holy mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, miss Xie, it’s said that there’s an array of endless inscriptions on the holy mountain. You can’t fly up, you can only climb on foot.”</p><p>Chi Yue said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>A loud roar was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that someone from another tribe not far away had already rushed up the holy mountain.</p><p>The strange thing was that as soon as those people rushed up the holy mountain, they disappeared.</p><p>As expected, there was a formation on the holy mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, not long after, Lu Ming saw that some of the people who had rushed in flew back from inside.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s the situation inside?”</p><p>Someone hurriedly asked.</p><p>I need to clear the levels inside. When experts of the same cultivation level as me start to appear, more and more experts will appear after each level. If I fail, I’ll be bounced back.</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>it seems like there won’t be any danger if we fail. Let’s go!</p><p>Following that, more and more people rushed into the mountain.</p><p>Not long after, more people were bounced back.</p><p>On the side of the red leopard tribe, some people also rushed in, but they were also bounced back soon after.</p><p>The situation they encountered was similar to the others. Experts of the same cultivation level appeared to fight with them. The more rounds they passed, the more experts would appear later.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, be careful!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure fluttered and rushed towards the holy mountain. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing walked side by side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
