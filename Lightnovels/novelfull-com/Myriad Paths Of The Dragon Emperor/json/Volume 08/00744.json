The nine powerhouses from the golden sword sect who had entered were all killed.</p><p>...</p><p>In the outside world, countless people saw this scene.</p><p>“Despicable, despicable!”</p><p>The remaining members of the golden sword sect who had not entered the Heavenly King stele’s world were all furious.</p><p>Jiang Taixu and the others were too despicable.</p><p>“What are you guys talking about?”</p><p>In the outside world, there were also people from the Jiang and Wang families who had their eyes on the golden sword sect.</p><p>The metal sword sect’s people’s expressions changed drastically, and they didn’t continue speaking.</p><p>“Hmph, the world of the Heavenly King tablet is not like the battle stage where you can fight one on one. You can use all kinds of methods, don’t you understand? Once you enter, you must be prepared to be killed!”</p><p>Someone from the Jiang family shouted coldly.</p><p>Although the others were indignant, they could only keep their mouths shut because the ancient family was too powerful.</p><p>look, that’s Lu Ming’s girlfriend and Jian feiliu. They’re going to meet Jiang Taixu.</p><p>Wang Jue is also here. Wang Jue is also nearby.</p><p>“It’s over, this is dangerous!”</p><p>On the stele, two figures appeared. They were Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu met by chance half a day after entering the divine King monument. They decided to work together.</p><p>“I wonder where brother Lu is?”</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that fellow. No one here is his match.”</p><p>Xie nianqing was very confident in Lu Ming.</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing stopped. Jian feiliu was stunned. The next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>In front of him, more than a dozen figures appeared.</p><p>The leader was Jiang Taixu.</p><p>Beside him were two young men, who were obviously the most powerful existences of the Jiang family. The other dozen or so people were all big men and old men, exuding sharp auras.</p><p>“Jiang Taixu!”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s expression changed. He sent a message to Xie nianqing, ” “Miss Xie, there are too many of them. Let’s retreat first!”</p><p>“The other party has killing intent, he might not let us go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jiang Taixu and the others were extremely fast. Like spirit weapons, they cut through the void and appeared in front of Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu in an instant.</p><p>hahaha, Jian feiliu, and you, Lu Ming’s woman, you won’t be able to escape today. But don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I’ll cripple your cultivation and then lead you to kill you in front of Lu Ming!</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s voice was very cold.</p><p>it seems that you’ve been defeated by Lu Ming. Otherwise, why would you use such a method to deal with Lu Ming!</p><p>Xie nianqing said indifferently, his eyes filled with contempt.</p><p>“Bitch, shut up!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s sore spot was touched. He growled and glared at Xie nianqing with a ferocious expression.”B * tch, Lu Ming is dead for sure. And you, I won’t waste you. I’ll serve you well in front of Lu Ming.”</p><p>“Hehe, a heaven’s favorite from an ancient family? An expert on the Heavenly King ranking? You’re just a piece of trash. You’ve been defeated and you’re trying to win through despicable means. You’ll never be able to achieve anything!”</p><p>Xie nianqing sneered, his face full of disdain.</p><p>“Bitch, you’re looking for death!” Jiang Taixu roared in anger.</p><p>“Haha, this girl has a sharp mouth. I like it!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, Wang Jue and Wang mie brought over a dozen people and walked over.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s face was extremely serious, while Xie nianqing frowned slightly.</p><p>“Wang Jue, you’ve come at the right time. Have you settled everything?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu said.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Wang Jue waved his hand, and four golden combat swords flew out and stabbed into the ground below.</p><p>Jiang Taixu also waved his hand. Five golden combat swords flew out and stabbed into the ground.</p><p>Nine golden battle swords were arranged in a row.</p><p>“You guys … Animal!”</p><p>Jian feiliu roared and his face looked terrible.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and the others were actually hunting the members of the metal sword sect.</p><p>With nine members of the metal sword sect killed, Jian feiliu’s eyes turned red.</p><p>they shouldn’t have died. They can only blame themselves for being too close to Lu Ming. As for all of you, you will soon follow in their footsteps!</p><p>Jiang Taixu smiled hideously.</p><p>At this moment, the outside world was also frozen here.</p><p>Many people were indignant and felt that the actions of Jiang Taixu and the others were shameful.</p><p>However, the other party was a heaven’s favorite from one of the six great ancient families. They didn’t dare to say anything and could only keep it in their stomachs.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taixu waved his hand and led a dozen Masters of the Jiang family towards Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hands, and the sky demon force field enveloped Jian feiliu and herself.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared and rushed into the field like a divine weapon.</p><p>More than a dozen Jiang family Masters also rushed into the sky demon power field.</p><p>As soon as they charged into the sky demon power field, their expressions changed drastically, and they felt an unimaginable pressure.</p><p>Ever since Xie nianqing had successfully fused the destruction will and the wind will, the power of the sky demon power field had increased by a large margin. In addition, her bloodline had undergone Nirvana and she had reached the ninth level of the king stage, making her even more powerful.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>The terrifying cutting power started to cut the people of the Jiang family crazily.</p><p>Some of them immediately coughed out large mouthfuls of blood. They were severely injured.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu let out a long howl. His palm was like a heavenly blade, cutting through everything. With a single strike, the force field in front of him was broken. Jiang Taixu strode forward and rushed in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>The light in Jian feiliu’s eyes turned golden. Dazzling golden light filled his hand and turned into a sharp sword light, slashing toward Jiang Taixu.</p><p>jumping clowns! You dare to attack me? you’re looking for death!</p><p>Jiang Taixu struck out with his palm again, which turned into a divine sword and crashed into the dazzling golden sword light. The sword light was shattered, and Jian feiliu quickly retreated. His face turned red and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The difference between him and Jiang Taixu was too great. Even with the help of Xie nianqing’s sky demon power field, he was still far from Jiang Taixu’s opponent.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was like a divine weapon, unstoppable. He continued to break through the sky demon force field and went for Xie nianqing.</p><p>“The right hand of the sky demon!”</p><p>Xie nianqing mumbled. A black light bloomed from his body as he pressed his hand forward. In the air, a beautiful arm condensed like the most beautiful work of art in the world and shot toward Jiang Taixu.</p><p>Jiang Taixu struck out with his palm, which collided with the beautiful arm. In an instant, Jiang Taixu’s expression changed slightly. His body trembled and he took a step back.</p><p>In the process of clashing with Xie nianqing, he was bombarded by a powerful destructive cutting force. In the sky demon power field, he was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>This made his killing intent even more intense.</p><p>First, he was defeated by Lu Ming. Now, he was at a disadvantage against Xie nianqing. He could not accept it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s bloodline exploded and his aura grew stronger as he charged toward Xie nianqing.</p><p>Jian feiliu, you deal with those people. Leave this man to me!</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Jian feiliu.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s body flashed and golden sword light bloomed, attacking the other people of the Jiang family.</p><p>Those people were also very strong. They kept breaking through the sky demon force field, giving Xie nianqing a lot of pressure.</p><p>Not only did Xie nianqing have to control the force field, but he also had to deal with Jiang Taixu.</p><p>This caused the spectators to be extremely shocked.</p><p>It was obvious that Xie nianqing could overpower Jiang Taixu if he was alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
