All the mountains were side by side, and he couldn’t see the end.</p><p>...</p><p>There was a huge city gate under a few of the mountains.</p><p>It was one of the city gates to ninedragons.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were calm.</p><p>haha, I’m back. Come, let’s go in!</p><p>Kong Jin carried his hatchet on his shoulder and held a lamb leg in one hand. He gnawed on it as he walked forward.</p><p>“I say, fatty, why are you carrying your axe all day? aren’t you tired? don’t you have a storage ring?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked as they walked.</p><p>Ever since he saw Kong Jin, he had been seen carrying his huge battle axe every day.</p><p>I’m carrying this battle axe to lose weight!</p><p>Kong Jin answered.</p><p>Kong Jin’s answer made Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stagger and almost fall.</p><p>“To lose weight? Then why don’t you stop eating?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said in disdain.</p><p>“How can you carry the battleaxe if you don’t eat? how can you lose weight if you can’t carry the battleaxe? You guys don’t know, but it’s very tiring to carry a battle-axe every day!”</p><p>Kong Jin said with a serious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were speechless. They were completely defeated.</p><p>The city gate of ninedragons was huge, at least hundreds of meters high and hundreds of meters wide.</p><p>At the city gate, people came and went, and it was very lively.</p><p>All kinds of Warriors riding on demonic beasts and fierce beasts could be seen rushing past and into ninedragons.</p><p>There was no one guarding the city gate, and no one was checking, so anyone could enter and leave at will.</p><p>This was confidence!</p><p>As the main palace of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, ninelongs city gathered the most powerful forces of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace. In the entire empyrean heaven divine Palace, more than 80% of the experts above the spirit embryo realm were in ninelongs city.</p><p>The spirit embryo realm, the spiritual God Realm, and even the Supreme.</p><p>In addition, Martial Emperor Di Yi was also there.</p><p>No matter if it was the heavenly corpse sect or the heavenly demon Valley, if they dared to break into ninedragons and cause trouble, they would be courting death, unless they were Imperial powerhouses.</p><p>However, if an Imperial path expert really came, it would be useless no matter how many experts there were at the city gate.</p><p>The three of them walked through the city gate, and what entered their eyes was a huge and wide road that led in all directions. There was also an endless mountain range.</p><p>The inside of ninedragons was an entire world. After all, its area was comparable to the Tianxuan region.</p><p>the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth is so dense. Also, the essence realm of heaven and earth is much clearer than other places!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming, this is only the edge. Nine dragon veins converge in Nine Dragons city. The closer you are to the Dragon vein, the richer the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth will be, and the clearer the conception of heaven and earth will be. Therefore, in Nine Dragons city, martial Kings and martial artists are everywhere, and even Sea of Souls realm experts are a dime a dozen. Only those who are above the spirit embryo realm can be considered as experts.</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed, mainly because the conditions were too good.</p><p>“Nine Dragons city is dominated by the Dragon veins. Right now, in six directions, the core of the six dragon veins are occupied by the six great ancient clans. With the Dragon veins as the core, countless clans and sects of all sizes are scattered all over the city. On the larger scale, these powers all belong to the Emperor heaven divine Palace. On the smaller scale, they compete with each other, developing and fighting each other. Every day, there are powers being destroyed, and new powers rising up. Even the six great ancient clans are competing with each other. Only by doing so can more powerhouses be born.”</p><p>Kong Jin explained. He had stayed in ninedragons before, so he knew the place quite well.</p><p>we’re currently in the easternmost region of the Dragon vein. The strongest force here is one of the six ancient families, the Wang family. The Wang family occupies the core of the Dragon vein, and there are countless forces of various sizes scattered around the Dragon vein.</p><p>Kong Jin continued.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The three of them chose a direction and chatted as they flew.</p><p>A few hours later, a city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The three of them flew in.</p><p>This city was called Grand gathering city. According to Kong Jin’s introduction, there were more than a dozen forces of various sizes scattered around the city.</p><p>And this place had not officially entered the Dragon vein in the East. It was only in the outer area.</p><p>The closer it was to the Dragon vein, the richer the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was. Only the powerful forces could occupy it.</p><p>Small forces could only be in the periphery.</p><p>The three of them strolled around the city.</p><p>The city was not particularly large, but there were many experts on the streets.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the area. All of them were martial Kings. Fortunately, there were not many at the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>He saw a few, but they were not very strong.</p><p>After all, this was only the periphery of the Dragon vein.</p><p>“Eh? Tingting, it’s me, the young master.”</p><p>Suddenly, Kong Jin smiled brightly and greeted a woman.</p><p>The woman was about 23 or 24 years old. She was wearing a light yellow dress and had a slim figure. She was very beautiful.</p><p>The woman was walking over. When she heard the voice, she looked over. Then, she glared at Kong Jin and walked over.</p><p>“Damn fatty, are you a friend or not? you actually left without saying goodbye last time. Did he lie to a little girl again?”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s beautiful eyes sized up Kong Jin as she unhappily said.</p><p>“Haha, Tingting, why would I? With a beauty like you in front of me, how can other beauties enter my eyes? the last time I left, I had something to do. See, I came back as soon as I finished. One day apart really feels like three years. Look, I’ve lost weight.”</p><p>As he said that, Kong Jin patted his stomach. Instantly, his fat started to shake like waves. It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t try to flatter me. Your tricks are useless Against Me!”</p><p>The girl’s lips curled up and she looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Haha, Tingting, come, let me introduce you!”</p><p>“This is ruan Tingting, my confidante!” Kong Jin laughed.</p><p>“Go away, damn fatty, don’t talk nonsense, I haven’t known you for long.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting interrupted Kong Jin. She looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and said,”The two of you look very dignified, are you friends of this fatty? I advise the two of you, this damn fatty is ignorant and incompetent, lazy and good at eating. The two of you shouldn’t make bad friends by mistake and be led astray by this damn fatty.”</p><p>“Hey, Tingting, how can you say that about me? we’re friends, aren’t we?”</p><p>Kong Jin said unhappily.</p><p>“Hmph, who asked you to be so unreliable and leave without saying goodbye? next time, don’t say that I don’t recognize you as a friend.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting coldly snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming found Kong Jin and ruan Tingting’s bickering rather interesting and did not interrupt.</p><p>“Of course. With such a beautiful friend like you, how could I leave without saying goodbye? haha, these two are friends I met outside. Their names are Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. Have you heard of them?”</p><p>Kong Jin introduced Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I’ve never heard of it!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shook her head.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that the secret Chamber of Commerce had not updated the list of top 1000 talents yet. In addition, the battle of Providence was approaching. Most people’s attention was on the top of the list of top 1000 talents. Not many people paid attention to the battle of the Heavenly King List.</p><p>However, this was also good. It was not a good thing to have too many people paying attention to it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
