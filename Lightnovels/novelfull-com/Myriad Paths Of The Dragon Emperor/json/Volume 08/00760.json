When we go back, I promise not to say a word. We’ll pretend that today’s incident never happened and let it go.</p><p>...</p><p>“Yes, yes, let’s forget it!”</p><p>The two old men from the Miao family shouted one after another.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I don’t trust you!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s face was cold as a bright sword light poured out. The two pitiful elders from the Miao family were separated by Lu Ming and Kong Jin despite their strength. They were completely unable to resist and their bodies were pierced by the sword light.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, ruan Tingting’s gaze swept across Lu Ming before landing on Kong Jin.”Fatty, you’ve been hiding it from me for so long. You’re so strong, but you didn’t tell me!”</p><p>“Tingting, you didn’t ask me, did you?” Kong Jin chuckled.</p><p>this time, it’s all thanks to you guys. Otherwise, we would have been in danger. How about this, all of the storage rings here will belong to you. We don’t want any of them!</p><p>Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>“It should be like this!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting nodded.</p><p>Although Shi Kai was a little indignant, it was all thanks to Lu Ming and Kong Jin this time. He did not have the face to ask for a share of the profits.</p><p>“This place was found by everyone, so let’s split it equally!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward and devoured the blood essence of the two elders without anyone knowing.</p><p>Two martial artists at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm. As for the skeleton, Lu Ming estimated that it was at most at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm when it was alive. With Lu Ming’s current realm, he was not too tempted, so he suggested splitting it equally.</p><p>Qiao Xuan, Shi Kai, and a few others were all local tyrants. Although their cultivation was not strong, it might be useful to build good relations with them.</p><p>well, Lu Ming is right. Let’s split it equally. You guys can check it!</p><p>Kong Jin’s Zhen Yuan sucked in a few storage rings and he handed them to ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Thank you, brother Kong and brother Lu!”</p><p>Shi Kai immediately expressed his gratitude, his face beaming with joy.</p><p>As such, ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan did not decline and began to count. In the end, the six of them split it equally.</p><p>the mission has been completed. Let’s go back first. Thank you for this time. I’ll treat you to a big meal in two days!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said with a smile.</p><p>Qiao Xuan and Shi Kai were also beaming with joy. This time, they had struck it rich.</p><p>They left the secret underground room, and nothing happened along the way. It didn’t take long for them to return to Grand gathering city.</p><p>Qiao Xuan and Shi Kai were the first to leave, returning to their respective factions. Lu Ming and the rest returned to the courtyard with ruan Tingting.</p><p>After returning to the courtyard, ruan Tingting left first. She had to hand in the Black Ghost Scorpion mission.</p><p>After ruan Tingting went to the hall of missions to hand in her mission and was about to go back, she was stopped by a figure.</p><p>“Ye Qing, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes darkened as she looked at the figure in front of her.</p><p>The person in front of her was a woman. She was quite good-looking, but her mean eyes destroyed her beauty.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, my father is looking for you. Go to the meeting hall!”</p><p>Ye Qing said coldly.</p><p>“The sect master is looking for me?” Ruan Tingting frowned.</p><p>Ye Qing’s father was the wind sword sect’s sect leader.</p><p>Whether it was talent or beauty, ruan Tingting was superior to Ye Qing. In the past, Ye Qing had always been jealous of ruan Tingting and would cause trouble for her at any time. The relationship between the two was very bad.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ye Qing turned around and walked out. The cold smile on her face grew wider and there was a faint smug smile on her face.</p><p>Ruan Tingting frowned. She had a bad feeling about this, but since the sect master was looking for her, she had no choice but to go.</p><p>Not long after, ruan Tingting and Ye Qing arrived at the wind sword sect’s meeting hall.</p><p>In the conference hall, not only was the wind sword sect leader ye fa present, but there were also a few of the most powerful elders of the wind sword sect, all of whom were above the sea of soul realm.</p><p>“Sullo!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting saw su Luo behind an elder.</p><p>Sullo’s father was an elder.</p><p>Sullo looked at her with a cold gaze.</p><p>Ruan Tingting didn’t know why, but she had a bad feeling.</p><p>“This disciple greets the sect master and elders!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting bowed.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>The wind sword sect leader, ye fa, smiled.</p><p>“Many thanks, Palace Master!” Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>en, Tingting, your ruan family has received the wind sword sect’s favor for generations, and the wind sword sect has also nurtured you with all their heart. Now, there’s something that concerns the rise and fall of the wind sword sect that you need to do. You won’t refuse, right? ”</p><p>Ye fa said.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s heart skipped a beat. She knew that they were about to get to the main topic. She said, please speak, sect master. As long as Tingting can do it, I will do my best!</p><p>“Tingting, you should know about the hundred venerated mountain, right?” Ye fa said.</p><p>“The hundred venerated mountains? Could it be that it has already been opened?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was shocked.</p><p>the hundred venerates mountain is an extremely mysterious Holy Land for cultivation. It is said that there are more than 100 spiritual God Realm Masters who left their marks and inheritances in the hundred venerates mountain. It is usually not opened and will only be opened before the battle of Providence. The geniuses of those great families can naturally enter at will, but small forces like us have a fixed quota.</p><p>this time, there are a total of thirty-six forces surrounding the three cities, juhao city, Juxing city, and Jufeng city. There are only thirty spots, and only the six most powerful forces are qualified to be allocated spots. Therefore, after ten days, the thirty-six forces will send their strongest experts to compete for the first six spots!</p><p>Ye fa explained.</p><p>“Sect master, for this kind of competition, it’ll definitely be spiritual ocean tier Warriors fighting, right? my cultivation is low, how can I help?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting asked in confusion.</p><p>that’s right, it’ll naturally be a spiritual ocean tier expert. My wind sword sect’s patriarch will also come out of seclusion to battle. However, with my wind sword sect’s strength, it’s impossible for us to enter the top six. We’ll have to ask for external help. Only then can we enter the top six!</p><p>I can’t miss this opportunity. When the time comes, a few geniuses from my wind sword sect will be able to enter, and we’ll be able to rise in the future.</p><p>Ye fa said.</p><p>Ruan Tingting still didn’t say anything. She still didn’t know what she needed to do.</p><p>Tingting, to tell you the truth, the two seniors of clear river Mountain have taken a fancy to you. As long as you agree to marry them, they will help my wind sword sect. In that case, my wind sword sect will have a high chance of getting into the top six!</p><p>After ye fa finished speaking, he looked at ruan Tingting with bright eyes.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s mind seemed to have been struck by lightning.</p><p>After a long time, ye FA’s true motive was finally revealed. He wanted him to marry the two monsters of Mount Qinghe.</p><p>The two monsters of Qing He were two old monsters who had lived for more than a thousand years. They were both vicious and eccentric, and they were famous in the vicinity of Grand gathering city. Ye fa actually wanted to use her as a condition to marry the two old monsters in exchange for their help.</p><p>Yes, she was married to two old monsters at the same time.</p><p>Ruan Tingting never expected such a thing to happen.</p><p>“I don’t agree!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting clenched her fists tightly and took a deep breath. She looked at ye fa with determination.</p><p>Ye fa frowned, and so did the other elders.</p><p>Tingting, you have to know how important this opportunity is to the wind sword sect. The two seniors from clear river Mountain are at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm and the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. With their help, we’ll definitely be able to get into the top six. Even if we’re in sixth place, we’ll still have three spots. This matter concerns the rise and fall of the wind sword sect!</p><p>Ye fa emphasized.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
