There are two pieces of the Heavenly King stele. One is for assessment and the other is for cultivation. There are imprints left by ancient mighty people on the Heavenly King stele. As long as you climb the stairs, you will be able to gain some insights. Some people can even use it to break through!</p><p>Jian Fengliu introduced.</p><p>didn’t they say that only by participating in the battle of the Heavenly King ranking and obtaining the 108 spots can one step onto the Heavenly King Stone staircase and obtain the opportunities on it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little curious.</p><p>you are talking about the top seven dark red steps. Only the final 108 people can step onto those seven dark red steps. That’s because the effect is much stronger than the 20 steps below.</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Oh? If you don’t get a slot, what will happen?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>death. There’s no quota. If you step on it, you’ll only die. There will be no exceptions. In fact, the next twenty steps are also very dangerous. It tests one’s willpower, and it has nothing to do with the strength of one’s heart of martial arts. If one’s willpower is not strong enough, and one’s heart of martial arts is not strong enough, it’s very likely that one will die on the top.</p><p>moreover, the higher you go, the more powerful and dangerous it will be. Of course, if you can withstand it and obtain rewards, the rewards will be equally great!</p><p>Jian feiliu explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, his eyes filled with interest.</p><p>The Heavenly King stele was only activated once every three years. During normal times, there would be no effect on the steps. It would only be activated when the time was up.</p><p>The effect of the stairs had started half a month ago, and some people had come here to cultivate half a month ago.</p><p>During this period of time, there would be a large number of people coming every day.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, one of them couldn’t take it anymore and was sent flying down the stairs. He fell to the ground and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>There were also people who stood up trembling and slowly retreated. They only let out a long breath when they were down the stairs, their bodies drenched in sweat.</p><p>sigh, I can only hold on for half an hour on the seventh step!</p><p>The man sighed. He was a middle-aged man.</p><p>it’s already not bad that you can last for half an hour on the seventh step. I’m ashamed to say that I’ve lived for 800 years, but I can only last for 20 minutes on the seventh step!</p><p>An old man sighed.</p><p>“Speaking of which, Jiang Taixu is really terrifying!”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked up at the figure sitting cross-legged on the 19th step.</p><p>The figure was tall and straight. One look and one could tell it was a young man.</p><p>“What? Is that Jiang Taixu up there?”</p><p>Jian feiliu exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Almost all of the top 600 on the list of top 1000 talents of the eastern barren territory were at the Sea of Souls realm, except for ten. These ten were at the martial King realm, but they were able to squeeze into the top 600 and compete with many other Sea of Souls realm Warriors. It was easy to imagine how powerful they were.</p><p>These ten people were also in the top ten of the Heavenly King ranking, known as the ten Heavenly Kings.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was one of them. He was the descendant of the Jiang family, one of the six great ancient aristocratic families.</p><p>now, the top four of the ten Heavenly Kings have already reached the Sea of Souls realm and will not participate in this competition. The last one is a genius of the talisman sect and will not participate in this competition either. This Jiang Taixu is ranked sixth among the ten Heavenly Kings and is one of the most likely candidates to compete for the strongest Heavenly King in this Heavenly King ranking.</p><p>that’s right. He’s too terrifying. He’s already been on the 19th level for three days!</p><p>Oh my God, this is too terrifying. He’s just one step away from being comparable to the ancient heroes.</p><p>Discussions could be heard from all around.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze pierced through the crowd and landed on the figure at the top.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of air being torn could be heard from time to time as more and more people arrived.</p><p>Lu Ming saw Gao Qiang, a few gray-robed young men from the heavenly corpse sect, and Qin Qingshan and Qin qingfei.</p><p>Qin qingfei’s eyes were filled with fear when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A scorching aura descended as a group of people arrived, causing the crowd to hurriedly avoid them.</p><p>He was from the Wang family, an ancient family.</p><p>There were more than a dozen people from the Wang clan. It was obvious that this was not the entire Wang clan, but only a small portion.</p><p>Wang Mang was one of them.</p><p>“You little bastard!”</p><p>The moment Wang Mang arrived, his cold eyes were fixed on Lu Ming and Jian feiliu.</p><p>“Wang Mang, the one you’re talking about, is that kid?”</p><p>Beside Wang Mang, there was a young man. This young man was very strange. His eyes were actually red, like rubies. It was extremely demonic.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s that little bastard!”</p><p>Wang Mang pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The red-eyed young man strode toward Lu Ming. The others along the way stepped back as the young man’s body temperature was too hot.</p><p>he’s from the Wang family, an ancient family. That man’s eyes are fiery red. He should be Wang mie!</p><p>list of top 1000 talents, 635th, Wang mie!</p><p>Soft discussions could be heard all around.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you have to be careful. This person is very strong!” He warned.</p><p>Jian feiliu reminded him in a low voice.</p><p>The 635th place on the list of top 1000 talents was almost the strongest group of King tiers.</p><p>One had to know that in the top six hundred, other than the ten Heavenly Kings, the others were all in the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Brat, last night, you were the one who injured my Wang family’s people and said arrogantly that my Wang family is nothing?”</p><p>Wang mie walked up to Lu Ming and asked indifferently. His voice was calm, but there was a condescending look in it.</p><p>“So what if I am?”</p><p>Lu Ming replied calmly.</p><p>“Hahaha, so what if I am? You don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. So what if you dare to say yes in front of me? I’m telling you, the consequence is death!”</p><p>Wang mie laughed out loud, his voice extremely cold.</p><p>“You can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming was still very calm.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Purple flames rose from Wang mie’s body. The terrifying temperature instantly evaporated the air. The area within three meters of where he stood became a vacuum.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, a powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. He circulated his true energy and roared like a dragon. The three-colored will of heaven and earth surrounded his body.</p><p>The moment their auras clashed, Lu Ming instantly felt a terrifying Heat Surge towards him. It was as if this heat could burn and destroy everything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body could not help but take three steps back.</p><p>Wang mie was also pushed back three steps.</p><p>This scene caused an uproar.</p><p>“Who is that young man? He’s so terrifying that he’s not at a disadvantage when clashing with Wang mie’s aura. Terrifying!”</p><p>“He’s indeed terrifying. I’ve never seen him before. He should be a new genius. There are too many geniuses in this year’s Heavenly King ranking competition. It’s going to be too difficult for us.”</p><p>Some of the older generation sighed.</p><p>Although many of the older generation had cultivated for hundreds of years, even close to a thousand years, and were terrifying in all aspects, they were unable to break through to the spirit ocean realm. Their talents were ultimately limited.</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that he couldn’t break through to the spirit ocean realm meant that the intent realm of heaven and earth was still stuck at the great circle of level one and hadn’t reached level two.</p><p>Every time there was a competition for the Heavenly King ranking, the young geniuses always had the advantage.</p><p>And this time, there were even more geniuses. No wonder the older generation was in despair.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
