He strode forward and charged toward su tengshan.</p><p>“Sect master, elders, let’s attack together and kill this brat!”</p><p>Su tengshan’s face changed as he shouted.</p><p>He had just received a punch from Lu Ming and was rather fearful of him.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other two patriarchs made their moves. At the same time, su tengshan made his move as well. The three of them joined forces and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>The two elders were at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm, while su tengshan was at the late stage.</p><p>Ye fa didn’t make a move, he just stood at the side.</p><p>When the three of them joined forces, their momentum was Grand and their power was boundless. Their momentum was extremely shocking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even blink. His face was still cold as he stared at su tengshan.</p><p>Just as the three of them were about to land their attacks on Lu Ming, he threw three punches.</p><p>With three miserable shrieks, su tengshan and the other two were sent flying far away while spitting out blood.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The wind sword sect members were dumbfounded as they watched this scene in shock.</p><p>This young man was actually so terrifying, heavily injuring three spiritual ocean tier elders with one move. This was too inconceivable.</p><p>“No one can save you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward su tengshan, step by step.</p><p>Su tengshan’s heart trembled, and his face turned pale.</p><p>He retreated frantically and shouted, ” “Sect master, sect master, save me!”</p><p>Ye FA’s expression turned ugly. Lu Ming had injured three elders in one move. Even he could not do it.</p><p>His cultivation was only at the early stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, quickly ask the ancestor to come out of the mountain!”</p><p>Ye fa roared and retreated with his men, ignoring su tengshan.</p><p>“Sect master!”</p><p>Su tengshan shouted in despair.</p><p>“What are you shouting for?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure appeared in front of su tengshan. He struck his palm at su tengshan.</p><p>Su tengshan tried his best to resist, but it was useless. He was struck down by Lu Ming’s palm and crashed heavily into the mountain below the wind sword sect, creating a huge pit that was dozens of meters wide.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand glowed, and a long spear condensed from vital essence appeared. With a wave of his hand, the long spear shot out like lightning and flew down su tengshan, piercing his dantian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Su tengshan’s dantian seemed to have let out a loud boom. Lu Ming had pierced through His Spirit ocean and it exploded.</p><p>His spiritual ocean was broken, and his cultivation was crippled.</p><p>Su tengshan screamed hysterically.</p><p>The rest of the wind sword sect disciples turned pale. A spiritual ocean tier elder was as weak as a baby in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Ye FA’s eyes were filled with humiliation. However, he did not dare to make a move. In his eyes, Lu Ming was unfathomable and gave him immense pressure. He had a feeling that if he made a move, he would end up like su tengshan.</p><p>Therefore, he retreated and waited for help.</p><p>Ye Qing’s face was also extremely pale, but her eyes were filled with jealousy.</p><p>She was jealous of ruan Tingting. Why did such a powerful young master Stand up for her, but she didn’t?</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure suddenly appeared not far from ye fa and pressed down with one hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sky demon power field was released, and a huge pressure enveloped ye fa and the others.</p><p>Some of them screamed in pain. Under the immense pressure, their bones were broken and they coughed up blood.</p><p>Even ye FA’s face changed dramatically. He had to use all his Zhen Yuan to block the attack.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>One of the elders who had been injured by Lu Ming roared and tried to break through the sky demon power field.</p><p>However, in the next moment, The Other Wind sword sect disciples widened their eyes in horror. That was because they saw that the lower half of the elder’s body had charged out, but his lower half was still in place.</p><p>He had been cut in half at the waist.</p><p>The elder also saw this scene and let out a shrill and terrified scream. However, he did not die immediately.</p><p>“You’d better not move!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly.</p><p>Ye FA’s face turned ashen, who were these people? It was too terrifying. He felt that any one of them could easily kill him.</p><p>“Could it be that ruan Tingting asked a few friends to help the wind sword sect compete?”</p><p>Ye fa had a feeling that he was wrong this time.</p><p>But now that things had come to this, he could only brace himself and continue.</p><p>Now, he could only hope that the wind sword sect’s Grandmaster would arrive as soon as possible.</p><p>The wind sword sect’s patriarch had a cultivation at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier. He could definitely kill these kids.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the half-dead su tengshan, throwing him in front of ruan Tingting.</p><p>This person needed ruan Tingting to kill.</p><p>He took a step forward and appeared in front of ye fa and the others.</p><p>today, all of you will die. There’s no need for the wind sword sect to remain in this world!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The Spear’s radiance soared into the sky.</p><p>Today, he was going to flatten the wind sword sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from behind. It was ruan Tingting.</p><p>At this moment, ruan Tingting’s cultivation had been unsealed. Her eyes were cold and filled with killing intent. She said, ” Lu Ming, don’t kill them. I’ll take revenge with my own hands. One day, I’ll flatten the wind sword sect and avenge my parents!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He then nodded.”Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming understood that ruan Tingting had to take revenge on her own. This way, she would not have any inner demons in her heart that would hinder her future cultivation.</p><p>as for su tengshan, you will die today!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes turned to su tengshan.</p><p>“No, help!”</p><p>Su tengshan shouted.</p><p>He knew all too well about ruan Tingting and ruan Zhen’s background. They didn’t have any powerful friends, so he killed them without any restraint. He never dreamed that he would provoke such terrifying fiends.</p><p>Now, he was filled with regret.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s sword light pierced through su tengshan’s heart, and the sword Qi crushed his heart into pieces.</p><p>Su tengshan’s eyes were wide open as he shouted unwillingly. Then, he stopped breathing.</p><p>ye fa, just you wait. I will personally destroy the wind sword sect and make you pay for your actions!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes were extremely cold, revealing a bone-deep hatred and killing intent.</p><p>Seeing such a gaze, even ye fa, who had lived for many years, could not help but tremble.</p><p>“Wait a minute, this woman, I don’t feel comfortable looking at her!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Ye Qing. He reached out and caught Ye Qing in his hand.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me, don’t kill me, father, save me!”</p><p>no! Ye Qing screamed crazily, her face pale and bloodless.</p><p>release Qing ‘er now. Otherwise, the wind sword sect will not rest until you die!</p><p>Ye fa roared as his Zhen Yuan exploded.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill her. I’ll leave her life to Tingting.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He pointed his finger and directly crippled Ye Qing’s cultivation.</p><p>“Didn’t you want to obtain a spot to enter the hundred venerated mountains? Could he still enter after his cultivation was crippled? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and threw Ye Qing out.</p><p>Ye Qing screamed in despair.</p><p>Her original goal was to sacrifice ruan Tingting to fulfill her wish and let her enter the hundred venerates mountain. Perhaps she would be able to obtain a great opportunity in the hundred venerates mountain and rise to the top.</p><p>She was full of hope.</p><p>But now, there was no more hope, only despair. Even if there was a spot, it was useless to her.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting carried her parents ‘corpses and flew out of the wind sword sect with Lu Ming and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
