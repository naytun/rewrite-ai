Moreover, Kong Jin still looked very casual. How strong was Kong Jin?</p><p>first level of the spiritual ocean tier. A cultivation at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier is actually so powerful. Could he be a peerless prodigy? ”</p><p>Qiao long muttered to himself in his heart.</p><p>In the spiritual ocean tier, those who could still fight across levels were definitely peerless geniuses.</p><p>In ninedragons, there were a lot of people who broke through to the sea of Souls realm before the age of thirty, but most of them were just normal Warriors. They were just a bit more outstanding, but not prodigies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qiao long was certain that Kong Jin was definitely a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>His heart was burning.</p><p>If Kong Jin was a prodigy, what about Lu Ming?</p><p>“Lu Ming! Lu Ming?”</p><p>All of a sudden, Xu Long’s eyes widened and his heart started to beat faster.</p><p>He remembered, he remembered.</p><p>Some time ago, he had heard from his friends that this year’s battle for the Heavenly King List had ended. The new Heavenly King List had been released.</p><p>The strongest Esper who ranked first in this year’s competition was called Lu Ming.</p><p>But now, in ninedragons, all the cultivation sanctuaries had opened, and countless forces, big and small, had their eyes on those cultivation sanctuaries. They had their eyes on those sea of soul realm geniuses who were ranked at the top, so they didn’t pay much attention to the Heavenly King List at all.</p><p>Now, he finally remembered.</p><p>He was the strongest on the Heavenly King ranking, so it was normal for him to break through to the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Could it really be that Lu Ming?” Xu Long’s heart beat faster.</p><p>If he really was the strongest Esper, then how strong would his battle prowess be after breaking through to the spiritual ocean tier? It was completely unpredictable.</p><p>what, what an amazing young man! Haha, I’m convinced!</p><p>Elder Hua was knocked back by Kong Jin’s punch, but he was not angry. He adjusted his breath and laughed out loud.</p><p>“Senior, thanks for letting me win!” Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>“Senior, should I try?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at elder Hua.</p><p>Elder Hua’s face stiffened. He felt a little uncertain.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Suddenly, he took a step forward and struck his palm down in the air.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was clearly slashing in the air, but the void was like water waves, rippling and rippling. As Lu Ming’s palm swept across, the ripples spread far away.</p><p>The hearts of Qiao long, elder Hua, and the others suddenly jumped, and their eyes widened.</p><p>To be able to stir the void with a casual swing of his palm, such strength was truly terrifying.</p><p>haha, enough, enough. The strength of the two little brothers has broadened our horizons. I’m impressed, I’m impressed!</p><p>Qiao long burst out laughing.</p><p>“Sect master Qiao, do we have the right to fight for the sea Cloud sect?” Kong Jin said.</p><p>“Of course, of course, it is my Sea Cloud sect’s honor to be able to invite you two.”</p><p>Qiao long said with a smile.</p><p>it’s not just the two of us. We have a friend who’s going to participate as well!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“There’s another person?”</p><p>“What are your conditions for helping my Sea Cloud sect?” Qiao long asked.</p><p>the conditions are simple. We want four spots to enter the hundred venerated mountains! Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Four spots?”</p><p>what? ” Qiao long exclaimed. the two of you might not know this, but there are a total of 36 forces participating in the competition this time. Only the top six will have a spot, while the sixth will have three spots. The fifth and sixth will have four spots.</p><p>sect master Qiao, you don’t have to worry. As long as you get into the top three, you’ll have more than four slots. We want four slots, and the remaining slots will be yours!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his tone full of confidence.</p><p>He had a rough idea of the forces near Grand gathering city.</p><p>He was 100% confident that he would be in the top three.</p><p>Qiao long and the rest looked at each other. Lu Ming was too confident.</p><p>“Alright, I agree to this condition!”</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Qiao long agreed.</p><p>Without the help of Lu Ming and the rest, they would not have been able to get into the top six. By then, there would not have been a single spot.</p><p>this competition is a group battle. It’s a competition of the comprehensive strength of each force. Each force will send nine experts to fight at the same time. Only by defeating the opponent will you win. Therefore, the battle formation is very important!</p><p>“This time, there are three of you and I will send six experts. I wonder when you will have the time to practice battle formations together?”</p><p>Qiao long said.</p><p>sect master Qiao, I have a battle formation here. As long as you use it, it can form a powerful defensive force. It might be suitable for this competition. You can let the others practice it first!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade tablet and waved it around. He infused the array’s execution into the Jade tablet and threw it to Qiao long.</p><p>Qiao Long’s expression changed when he took it and read it.</p><p>He had some attainments in the Dao of inscriptions, so he could tell with a glance that this formation was extremely profound. It was a level six formation and was much more exquisite than the one he had obtained.</p><p>haha, thank you, young hero Lu. If you have any other requests, please let me know!</p><p>Qiao long was in a good mood and said with a smile.</p><p>“No need, sect master Qiao, we’ll be taking our leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left the place with Kong Jin. They returned to their residence.</p><p>sect leader, I think these two are definitely heaven’s pride experts. Although the list of top 1000 talents doesn’t have their names, there have been many new heaven’s pride experts recently.</p><p>Elder Hua said.</p><p>yes, there’s no mistake. You haven’t heard, have you? the name of the strongest Esper on the Heavenly King List this year is Lu Ming!</p><p>Qiao long said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others were even more shocked.</p><p>Of course, there was also ecstasy.</p><p>If that was the case, then the sea Cloud sect had really picked up a treasure this time.</p><p>No matter if they could get a ranking or not, being able to make friends with such a peerless genius was beneficial to a small force like the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>After Lu Ming and Kong Jin returned to their residence, they began to cultivate.</p><p>After ruan Tingting experienced this, she became even more hardworking in her cultivation and stayed in her room every day.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not participate in the battle formation practice as there was no need to. Qiao long and the rest thought that Lu Ming and the rest were familiar with battle formations and did not say much.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed. There was still one day left before the competition.</p><p>At this moment, Qiao Xuan came to invite Lu Ming and the rest to meet the other six participants of the competition and get to know them.</p><p>Sea Cloud sect, on a huge square.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the other two arrived, they saw six figures standing in different positions in the square. Their figures flickered and their auras intersected, merging and linking together.</p><p>They were rehearsing the battle formation that Lu Ming had given Qiao long back then.</p><p>One was at the early stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, two were at the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, two were at the middle and early stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, and one was at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Elder Hua was one of them. Qiao long stood to the side and watched.</p><p>“Three young heroes, you’ve come!”</p><p>Qiao long looked at Lu Ming and the rest and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>A moment later, the battle formation drill ended, and an old man with white hair strode over.</p><p>this person is the external helper my father invited. His name is you Bo, and his cultivation is at the early stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier!</p><p>Qiao Xuan introduced them to Lu Ming and the rest in a low voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
