Including Jian feiliu, there were thirty people.</p><p>...</p><p>Among them, there were some who were very old, and some who were in their thirties.</p><p>The oldest were the two old Kings who were close to a thousand years old. Seeing that their time was almost up, they wanted to try their luck. If they were lucky, they might be able to break through to the sea of soul realm. That way, their lifespans would increase by a thousand years.</p><p>Including Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, there were a total of 32 people. They stepped onto the inter-province transportation portal and headed to the Heavenly King domain.</p><p>The Heavenly King domain was a very special region in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>It was because the Heavenly King domain was very small, only one-tenth of the size of the Tianxuan domain. It was the smallest domain in the eastern barren territory, and it lacked resources. There were almost no powerful forces here.</p><p>Moreover, it was located at the border between the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect. Therefore, this was a no man’s land. Neither of the two Overlord forces had occupied it.</p><p>However, it didn’t affect his reputation in the eastern barren territory. He was the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>The two pieces of the Heavenly King tablet were located in the Heavenly King domain.</p><p>Every three years, the Heavenly King monument would open, and the Heavenly King ranking competition would be held there. Countless peak Kings would gather there.</p><p>More than a dozen big cities were built around the stele of Heavenly King.</p><p>These big cities usually had almost no people, but once the Heavenly King monument was opened, they would be packed with people.</p><p>“So many people?”</p><p>Looking at the city in front of him, people were coming and going, flying here and there. Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>This was because any one of these people was a peak-tier King.</p><p>all the peak-tier kings of the east continent, except for the sky demon Valley and the talisman Amulet sect, have come. This time, there are at least hundreds of thousands of peak-tier Kings.</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, everyone flew toward a big city.</p><p>After flying into the city, the group landed on a Street and looked for an Inn to stay in.</p><p>It was full, it was full.</p><p>Everyone looked for two houses in a row, and they were all full. It was only at the third house that there was an empty room.</p><p>“Brother Lu, let’s go out for a walk and find a place to have a few drinks.”</p><p>After the guest room was arranged, Jian feiliu went to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He found Xie nianqing and the three of them walked out.</p><p>In the gold sword sect’s group, only the three of them were young. The others were the youngest, already over thirty years old. They did not have any common topics to talk about, and it was still the three of them who were closer.</p><p>This small city was quite wide, but the streets were still full of people.</p><p>There were fewer young people and more older ones. Each of them had a strong aura and were powerful. One look and one could tell they were experts.</p><p>The three of them strolled around for a while and then walked into a restaurant. They ordered some food and wine, and as they ate, they listened to the conversations of the people around them to see if they could obtain some information.</p><p>it’s really too lively these two days. There are so many experts!</p><p>“With so many people fighting for the last 108 spots, the competition will be extremely fierce.”</p><p>this year will be even more brutal. In the past, the top ten places were usually taken by young geniuses. The rest of the places were usually split equally between the young and the older generation. But this year is different. Many terrifying young geniuses have emerged, and they are all extremely powerful.</p><p>that’s right. It’s a well-known fact that even the secret Chamber of Commerce hasn’t rearranged the list of top 1000 talents. It’s just that too many geniuses have appeared. Otherwise, the list would have changed a long time ago.</p><p>that’s right. If the list of top 1000 talents is re-arranged, those at the bottom of the list, such as Gao Qiang, Qin Qingshan, and Sheng Xingchen, would have been kicked out of the list long ago.</p><p>Around them, many people were drinking and chatting.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>All of a sudden, a young man slammed the table. His eyes were like lightning as he looked at another table and said coldly, ” “You’re just a frog in a well. What do you know about the matters of the heaven’s pride?”</p><p>This young man was tall and burly, with strong muscles and a powerful aura. One look and one could tell that he was an expert.</p><p>Three young men in gray robes were sitting at another table. They were the ones who had said that the last few on the list of top 1000 talents would be expelled.</p><p>“Hehe, what’s wrong? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>One of the young men sneered.</p><p>if you’re not on the list of top 1000 talents, how do you know how powerful they are? ”</p><p>The tall and burly youth sneered.</p><p>“Oh? So you’re a heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents?”</p><p>The gray-robed young man smiled faintly.</p><p>“I am Gao Qiang!”</p><p>The burly young man said arrogantly.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the other people in the restaurant were moved.</p><p>Gao Qiang was ranked last on the list of top 1000 talents. However, no matter where he ranked, he was still a heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents. His strength and talent were absolutely amazing.</p><p>“Oh? So it’s Gao Qiang, who’s at the bottom of the list of top 1000 talents. Hehe, a beauty like you should have been eliminated long ago.” The gray-robed young man was not surprised at all after hearing this. Instead, he revealed a faint mocking expression.</p><p>“In that case, you’re very strong. I’d like to experience it!”</p><p>Gao Qiang stood up, his eyes were cold, and the aura on his body became violent, like a fierce beast.</p><p>you want to fight? fine! Today, I’ll let you know how useless you are!</p><p>The gray-robed young man sneered and stood up as well, his body exuding a cold aura.</p><p>“Let’s go out and fight!”</p><p>After Gao Qiang finished speaking, he rushed out of the restaurant and flew into the sky.</p><p>“Two senior brothers, wait for me to come back and continue drinking!”</p><p>The gray-robed youth laughed. He then rushed out of the restaurant and flew into the sky.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant flew out one after another, watching the battle with interest.</p><p>After all, one of them was on the list of top 1000 talents. Even if he was ranked last, his combat strength was definitely not weak. Who was that gray-robed young man? With such strong self-confidence, it seemed that Gao Qiang was nothing in his eyes.</p><p>The other people in the surroundings also gathered around.</p><p>“That’s Gao Qiang!”</p><p>Someone recognized Gao Qiang.</p><p>In an instant, a large number of people gathered in all directions.</p><p>“Let’s see what kind of ability you have to dare to speak such arrogant words!”</p><p>The aura on Gao Qiang’s body was getting more and more terrifying. He was like an immemorial vicious beast that was choosing people to eat.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He took a step forward, and the space rumbled as terrifying energy wreaked havoc.</p><p>“Mad beast fist!”</p><p>Gao Qiang threw out a punch, and a beast’s roar sounded, shaking the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man sneered. Layers of black mist emanated from his body. The black mist twisted and turned, and a shrill ghostly wail was heard.</p><p>The gray-robed young man grabbed out with his claw. In the void, a Black River appeared, and within it, there was a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Gao Qiang’s fist and the gray-robed young man’s claw collided. Suddenly, a terrifying force raged. Gao Qiang’s expression changed drastically. He stepped in the air and retreated continuously.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Gao Qiang, a genius on the list of top 1000 talents, was actually at a disadvantage after one move. How was this possible?</p><p>Gao Qiang seemed to be unable to bear this result. With a loud roar, a huge fierce beast appeared above his head. The name of this fierce beast was unknown, but its whole body was covered with scales. It was filled with a fiendish Qi and looked extremely ferocious. Seven silver chakras appeared around the fierce beast.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
