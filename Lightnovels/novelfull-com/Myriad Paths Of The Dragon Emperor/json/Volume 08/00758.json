Could it be the immortal’s cave of a certain senior?”</p><p>Shi Kai’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Ruan Tingting put the corpse of the Black Ghost venomous Scorpion into her storage ring and also examined it. “This mound looks like it’s been here for a while. It’s covered with weeds, and I reckon that no one has been here for a long time. Could this be a cave abode left behind by a senior expert? A relic left behind?”</p><p>“It’s possible!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan and Shi Kai’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Ninedragons had given birth to countless powerhouses throughout its history. Some of them did not have any descendants and would leave behind cave abodes and relics after their deaths. If anyone were to encounter them, it would be a great opportunity.</p><p>Now, could it be that they had encountered such an opportunity?</p><p>The few of them were overjoyed.</p><p>“But how do we break this formation? If we inform the elders of the sect, we won’t get a share.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said with a frown.</p><p>this formation is quite powerful. That Black Ghost Scorpion was killed in an instant. I’ve only learned a little about the Dao of inscription, so I can’t break it at all.</p><p>Qiao Xuan sighed.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other and could only feel anxious.</p><p>Did he really have to hand over this rare opportunity to the elders of the sect? They were a little unwilling.</p><p>“I know a little about inscriptions, let me try!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you know the Dao of inscription?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“Yes, I understand!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He sized up the mound and said, the owner of this mound should be a rank 6 Alchemist. The formation he set up is a rank 6 formation.</p><p>“A level six formation? Then how do we break …”</p><p>Ruan Tingting opened her mouth, but before she could finish her words, she stopped and her beautiful eyes widened.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingertips danced in the air. In an instant, dense runes appeared in the air and flew toward the mound.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, and the rest were dumbfounded. Lu Ming’s speed of inscribing inscriptions was too fast.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, hundreds of inscriptions seemed to appear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the mound, a dazzling light appeared and mysterious inscriptions appeared.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the next moment, the mound actually split into two, revealing a dark passage.</p><p>“Beat … It’s opened?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others were dumbfounded and only reacted after a long time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect your Dao of inscription to be so profound. You even hid it from us before.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting blinked her big eyes and was a little surprised.</p><p>ah, ah, damn it. Lu Ming has stolen the limelight. Damn it!</p><p>Fatty was empty, wailing in his heart, feeling indignant.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Alright, let’s hurry in!”</p><p>A group of six people walked towards the tunnel that had been split open on the mound.</p><p>The passage was very long. After a few thousand meters, the front suddenly opened up, and a rather spacious underground space appeared.</p><p>This was an underground secret room, which should have been excavated by man. The area was very large.</p><p>A skeleton sat cross-legged in the middle of the secret room. There was a space ring on the finger of the skeleton.</p><p>“It really is the immortal’s cave of a senior. This senior must have been dead for many years.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s big eyes lit up.</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s and Shi Kai’s eyes also lit up. A sea of soul realm expert who could set up a rank 6 formation left behind a storage ring, how many treasures would there be in it? To peak King tiers like them, the temptation was huge.</p><p>“Let’s split it equally between the six of us? How is it?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan suggested.</p><p>“Evenly split? If Lu Ming had not opened the array this time, we would not have gotten it at all. I think Lu Ming should get more.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Hmm, that’s true!” Qiao Xuan nodded.</p><p>“I don’t mind if Lu Ming gets more, but the fatty and the lady didn’t do anything. I’m afraid it’s not good to split it equally with us!”</p><p>Shi Kai’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Hey, kid, what do you mean by that? are you looking down on me?” Kong Jin was immediately displeased.</p><p>“Hehehe, you guys don’t have to fight anymore. Everything inside is ours.”</p><p>Right at this moment, a cold sneer was heard. Two green-robed elders walked in from the passageway.</p><p>Ruan Tingting, Qiao Xuan, and Shi Kai’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Especially when they saw the clothes of the two old men, their faces became even uglier.</p><p>“The Miao family. You are from the Miao family.”</p><p>Qiao Xuan exclaimed.</p><p>hehe, that’s right. We are from the Miao family. In fact, we have discovered this cave dwelling a long time ago. It’s just that the array outside is quite tricky. We have been thinking of a way to solve it during this time. We didn’t expect that the array would be broken by you. Haha, the heavens are really helping us!</p><p>One of the old men laughed.</p><p>you two, there’s no proof. You said that you found it first, but no one knows. However, it’s a fact that we opened this cave. According to the rules, the treasures inside should belong to us!</p><p>Shi Kai argued.</p><p>“Yours? hehe, kid, you really have the guts to say that!”</p><p>An old man sneered, his eyes revealing a cold smile. The aura from his body also spread out. It was terrifying, powerful, and vast.</p><p>“Spiritual ocean tier, it’s the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Shi Kai exclaimed, his face turning pale. Ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan’s faces also turned pale.</p><p>“Senior, since you discovered this place first, it should belong to you. We’ll leave immediately, we’ll leave!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was quite decisive. When she saw that the situation was not right, she immediately gave up.</p><p>“Leave? Hehe, where to?”</p><p>One of the old men moved and blocked the passage.</p><p>The other old man scanned Xie nianqing, Qiao Xuan, and ruan Tingting with a burning gaze. He sneered, ” “Our luck today is too good. There are actually three beautiful little girls. Stunning, truly stunning. Hehe, you guys can stay and serve us!”</p><p>“How about this, I’ll take that girl and you take the other two, how about that?”</p><p>The old man who was blocking the passage pointed at Xie nianqing and said. His eyes were burning.</p><p>“You really know how to choose.”</p><p>The other old man pouted.</p><p>As for ruan Tingting and Qiao Xuan, their faces were already so pale that there was no trace of blood.</p><p>“Seniors, my father is the sea Cloud sect’s sect master. Please let us go.”</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s face was pale as she said in a trembling voice.</p><p>“So you’re the daughter of the sea Cloud sect’s sect master. Haha, then it’ll be even more fun to play with!”</p><p>An old man laughed, not afraid at all.</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others revealed looks of despair.</p><p>The Miao family wasn’t a power near Grand gathering city. The Miao family was located on the Dragon’s Vein. Those who had the qualifications to establish a power on the Dragon’s Vein were not comparable to the powers near Grand gathering city. They were much stronger than these powers.</p><p>The Miao family didn’t care about the forces near Grand gathering city at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
