Moreover, he had severely injured elder kui and Yin que.</p><p>All of this made her feel like she was in a dream.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Now, there was not even a trace of true essence in his body. His face was pale, which was caused by his lifespan being extracted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing gasped and walked over to support Lu Ming, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s body was strong and his vitality was strong. Now, the wound on her chest was slowly healing and she was fine.</p><p>“Little Qing, help me over. I want to kill them!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and helped Lu Ming walk forward.</p><p>At this moment, elder kui and Yin que were lying on the ground like mud, half dead. In such a situation, they naturally couldn’t control the puppets. Those giant snake puppets were all like statues, lying on the ground and not moving.</p><p>“Little brat, what do you want to do? I’m telling you, I’m the young master of the yin snake tribe, and my father is the chief of the yin snake tribe. If you dare to kill me, you’ll die without a doubt!”</p><p>Yin que shouted.</p><p>“I said, you must die today, no matter who you are. It won’t change the result!”</p><p>With Xie nianqing’s help, Lu Ming walked forward slowly. Above his head, a green spiritual fire spread out.</p><p>His body was weak and he couldn’t use his true essence, but he could still use his mental energy fire.</p><p>brat, I advise you to let us go. I’ve already sent a message back through a voice transmission talisman. If you kill us, you’ll have to face the crazy revenge of the yin snake tribe!</p><p>At this moment, elder kui sneered. He barely moved his body and a voice transmission jade talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Haha, well done, elder kui!”</p><p>Yin que laughed out loud. He then looked at Lu Ming and shouted,”Brat, my father has already received the news that you’re dead for sure. Now, if you cripple your own arms and legs and obediently give that slut to me to serve me, I might spare your lives!”</p><p>“Little Qing, I can’t move right now. I can’t even inscribe inscriptions. I’ll leave these two to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing as if he did not hear elder kui and Yin que’s words.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing helped Lu Ming sit down. With a dagger in his hand, he walked toward elder kui.</p><p>“B * tch, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Yin que roared.</p><p>“You dare?” Elder kui roared.</p><p>Xie nianqing was unmoved and strode forward.</p><p>Chi Yue came to Lu Ming’s side, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Xie nianqing walked in front of elder kui and swung his dagger. Elder kui’s head flew far away.</p><p>Then, he walked towards Yin que.</p><p>“No, don’t, don’t come over!”</p><p>Yin que was terrified, his face full of fear.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing would dare to kill them after knowing that news of them had reached the yin snake tribe. Where did they get the guts to do that?</p><p>The yin snake tribe was the most powerful tribe in the area.</p><p>“You should have expected this day to come!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were filled with killing intent. With a flash of his dagger, Yin que’s head fell to the ground.</p><p>All the yin snake tribesmen were dead!</p><p>“Lu Ming, we have to leave this place as soon as possible. The yin snake tribe’s experts might be here soon!”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Chi Yue put away all the giant snake puppets that were still in good condition. Then, she controlled the cheetah puppet to carry Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and fly back to the red leopard tribe at top speed.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the cheetah puppet’s back, constantly circulating the true war Dragon technique and beginning to recover his essential core.</p><p>The side effects of using the lightning cauldron were just too obvious. He would lose all his true essence and his body would be weak. Even if he still had his mental energy fire, he wouldn’t be able to inscribe any inscriptions. It was like he was a chicken at the mercy of others.</p><p>Furthermore, he now had a better understanding of the lightning cauldron’s power.</p><p>The stronger his cultivation was, the more powerful the lightning cauldron would be after absorbing the true essence. With his current cultivation, he should be able to pose a fatal threat to experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>But he might not be able to kill them.</p><p>Just now, there were two fourth level spiritual ocean tier inscription Masters in the yin snake tribe. The reason they were able to kill them in one blow was that those inscription Masters had used their spiritual power to control the puppets, and the puppets were entangled by dandan’s formation and couldn’t turn around to save them.</p><p>They could only rely on the inscription scrolls to resist and their defense was naturally greatly reduced. That was why they were killed by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he would at most heavily injure a fourth level spiritual ocean tier expert, but not kill him.</p><p>As for those at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier, they would probably only suffer light injuries.</p><p>Of course, if Lu Ming could enter the Sea of Souls realm, his Thunder mentality and true essence would increase greatly. Then, the power of the lightning cauldron would also increase crazily.</p><p>“Aiya, I’m so tired. I’ve accumulated so much energy, but it’s all used up in one go. Kid, this time, you must compensate me well!”</p><p>Dandan lay on Lu Ming’s shoulder, rolling her eyes continuously.</p><p>A few hours after they had left, a strong gust of wind blew and a dozen experts arrived at 10000 snakes Valley, riding on giant snake puppets.</p><p>The leader of the group was a middle-aged man with a poisonous snake wrapped around his neck. When they arrived, they quickly rushed into the depths of the 10000 snakes Valley.</p><p>Not long after, an earth-shaking roar was heard. kid from the outer world, red leopard tribe, kill, kill, kill!</p><p>His voice was full of killing intent. Even the snakes in 10000 snakes Valley trembled and shrank back into their caves.</p><p>……</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest returned to the red leopard tribe, Lu Ming focused on recovering his cultivation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already recovered a stream of vital essence in his dantian. Then, he took out a large number of top-grade spirit crystals and devoured the energy in them to recover his cultivation.</p><p>With a trace of essential core, Lu Ming’s recovery speed had greatly increased.</p><p>As soon as Chi Yue returned to the red leopard tribe, she went to find Chi jinkong to report the situation.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming killed Yin que?”</p><p>Chi jinkong’s shocked voice came from a large hall.</p><p>“Yes, father. What should we do now?”</p><p>Chi Yue stood in front of Chi jinkong and said.</p><p>Chi jinkong’s face was solemn. He frowned and said, ” Yin Buhai only has one son, and he has always doted on him. Now that Yin que has been killed, I’m afraid he will go crazy and take revenge. Pass down the order to strengthen the defense of all places. Also, I will immediately inform the elders to come here for a meeting!</p><p>The atmosphere in the red leopard tribe became tense, but Lu Ming was still fully focused on recovering.</p><p>Half a day after he returned to the red leopard tribe, his true essence had finally recovered to its peak.</p><p>“Little Qing, let me remove the seal on your hands and feet!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the room and saw Xie nianqing.</p><p>Now, Xie nianqing’s injuries were much better and he was almost fully recovered.</p><p>“Silly girl, are you alright?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming worriedly.</p><p>“I’m fine now!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over and held Xie nianqing’s hand in front of his eyes. He observed the ring seal on her wrist.</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed slightly when Lu Ming held her hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
