Two days had passed.</p><p>...</p><p>Riding on the golems, they could cultivate as they traveled.</p><p>“Yes, there’s a battle cry coming from the front!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and the giant snake puppet slowed down.</p><p>Jian feiliu and Xie nianqing also stopped their cultivation.</p><p>“It looks like there are Pirates trying to kill the caravan!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the giant snake puppet. He transformed into three rays of light and flew forward.</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Xin was in despair. She watched the people of the flame Chamber of Commerce die one by one in battle.</p><p>This time, the flame Chamber of Commerce had a large amount of valuable goods to transport to the golden light region. The goods were very valuable, and the flame Chamber of Commerce had mobilized almost all their forces.</p><p>Chen Dao, the strongest expert in the flame Chamber of Commerce, and Luo Xin’s father, Luo Ming, was also a peak-tier King.</p><p>In addition, there were two other peak-tier Kings, making it a total of four peak-tier Kings. Their strength could not be said to be weak.</p><p>However, the other party was even stronger, because they were the blood evil pirate group. Yes, it was the blood evil pirate group again, and this time, all of them were mobilized. What made them despair was that not only did the blood evil pirate group have four peak-tier Kings, their leader was even at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>They were completely outmatched and had already been surrounded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The leader of the blood Fiend Pirates was called Blood Fiend. With one palm, Chen Dao spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>Yun Sha, we’ve already agreed to hand over all our goods. Why are you still killing us? ”</p><p>Luo Ming roared, he was really unwilling.</p><p>“Why? Hehe, last time, my fifth and sixth brothers tried to Rob your flame Chamber of Commerce, but they were killed in the end. During this period of time, I have been investigating the movements of your flame Chamber of Commerce, intending to avenge my fifth and sixth brothers. I didn’t expect to hear the news that all of you are on the move. How can I miss such an opportunity?”</p><p>Bloody ghost sneered. The killing intent on his body was extremely strong.</p><p>Luo Xin laughed bitterly, so that was the case.</p><p>The blood Fiend Pirates wanted to take revenge for those people. Back then, the two peak-tier kings of the blood Fiend Pirates were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, in that situation, the Bloodfiend Pirates wanted to annihilate them. Of course, they had to retaliate. She did not blame Lu Ming. She could only say that the flame Chamber of Commerce was fated to have such a calamity.</p><p>“Little girl, I heard that my fifth brother fell for you and was killed later on. Why didn’t you agree to it back then? Why didn’t you just agree to my fifth brother’s request? you actually dared to resist and even ordered people to kill them. Today, I’ll take you down and let my other brothers enjoy you. I’ll let you know what regret is!”</p><p>Yun Sha’s voice was extremely cold, as cold as a venomous snake that was about to choose its prey.</p><p>“Chen Dao, you will bring Xin ‘er to break out of the encirclement. I will block them with all my strength!”</p><p>Luo Ming said to Chen Dao.</p><p>“Father, we can’t leave together!”</p><p>Luo Xin shouted.</p><p>If Luo Ming stayed behind to block them, it would definitely be a dead end.</p><p>“Go, where do you want to go? Today, none of you will be able to leave.”</p><p>The other four peak-tier kings of the blood Fiend Pirates spread out in all directions. There were also many other experts who blocked the other escape routes of the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>“Also, who was the murderer who killed my fifth and sixth brothers? Hurry up and tell me so that you won’t suffer so much!”</p><p>Xue Sha asked coldly.</p><p>I’ve told you that the person who killed your fifth and sixth brothers is not from the flame Chamber of Commerce. He was just passing by. We don’t know him, and we don’t know where they are now.</p><p>Luo Xin said.</p><p>“It seems like you’re not going to say anything? Alright, wait a moment, I’ll let you say it. ”</p><p>Xue Sha’s eyes turned even colder, and the aura from his body burst out. The aura of the spiritual ocean tier was like a vast ocean, spreading towards the flame Chamber of Commerce’s people. Luo Xin, Luo Ming, and the others felt even more despair.</p><p>“Are you looking for me?”</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice came from the distance.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Luo Xin’s body trembled. She didn’t know why, but she immediately became excited and looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>The others also looked in the direction of the sound.</p><p>Three young figures stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Luo Xin was excited.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Chen Dao’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>Only the few of them knew that Lu Ming was the Asura, the Asura who could kill a Sea of Souls realm deep-sea Giant snake.</p><p>Lu Ming was here. They were saved.</p><p>But the others didn’t know.</p><p>Yun Sha’s eyes were cold as he looked at Lu Ming and said,”Who are you?”</p><p>“Who am I? What a joke, weren’t you looking for me just now? I was the one who killed your fifth and sixth brothers.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>so it’s you. Hahaha, there’s a way to heaven, but you refuse to take it. There’s no Door to Hell, but you chose to throw yourself into it. How stupid. But this is good, it saves me the trouble of looking for you!</p><p>Bloody ghost laughed out loud, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>“Oh, really? From now on, the chaotic Astral Ocean will no longer have the Bloodfiend Pirates!”</p><p>“Xiaoqing, brother Jian, I’ll leave the rest to you,” Lu Ming said as he stepped forward.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>Jian feiliu smiled and walked toward a peak-tier King.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The peak-tier King roared as a bright blade light slashed toward Jian feiliu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A light sword sound rang out as a golden light flashed. Then, everyone was shocked to find that the peak King realm pirate’s blade light had been shattered. A bloody gash appeared in the middle of his forehead, and then his body was split in two.</p><p>A peak-tier King was killed by a single sword strike!</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing arrived in front of a peak-tier King.</p><p>But what happened next was even more terrifying. Just as the peak-tier King was about to attack, he froze on the spot, and only an expression of extreme fear could be seen on his face.</p><p>Then, with a bang, this peak-tier King turned into a cloud of blood mist, which spread in the air.</p><p>He died and turned into dust.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Everyone around them felt as if their chests were being sucked in by an air pump.</p><p>Terrifying, too terrifying! A peak-tier King had been killed without even the slightest chance to retaliate.</p><p>However, Xie nianqing and the others were clearly only peak-tier King tiers!</p><p>“He … Who are they?”</p><p>Luo Ming was stunned and stammered.</p><p>Luo Xin took a deep breath, pointed to Jian feiliu and said, ” “King Yama!”</p><p>“Yaksha!; He immediately pointed at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Finally, he pointed at Lu Ming and said,”Asura!” &Nbsp;</p><p>Luo Ming’s pupils contracted, and he took a few deep breaths and said, ” “So it’s them. No wonder, no wonder!”</p><p>Asura, King of Hell, Yaksha, everyone on golden sand island knew about them. Of course, Luo Ming had also heard of them.</p><p>He knew that the flame Chamber of Commerce could finally be saved today.</p><p>After killing two peak-tier Kings, Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu appeared in front of the other two peak-tier Kings, and their powerful auras enveloped the two.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
