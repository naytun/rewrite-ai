For example, the sky corpse sect’s corpse King and that fatty are both extremely terrifying and unfathomable!”</p><p>“The other members of the previous ten Heavenly Kings are also extremely terrifying. In the past few years, no one knows how strong they are. Perhaps they are even stronger than Jiang Taixu?”</p><p>“Furthermore, the heavenly stele world is not a one-on-one battle. It’s hard to say who will take first place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s actions caused a lot of discussion.</p><p>Half an hour later, Jiang Taixu’s figure appeared hundreds of thousands of miles away. As soon as he appeared, he coughed up another mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu growled in a low voice. He was extremely angry.</p><p>He had actually lost to Lu Ming. It was simply unbelievable and hard for him to accept.</p><p>This time, he was very ambitious and was determined to win the first place. However, he was defeated by Lu Ming on the first day. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core. He must kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, no matter how strong you are, you’re alone. I’ll kill you after I gather the other experts of the Jiang family. I’ll definitely win first place this time.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes glowed with malice and killing intent.</p><p>“Haha, Jiang Taixu, why are you in such a sorry state? are you besieged by the heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>haha! a laugh sounded as two figures stepped through the air.</p><p>“Wang Jue!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes glinted.</p><p>Wang Jue, a member of the ancient Wang family, ranked eighth in the last Heavenly King List.</p><p>Next to Wang Jue was Wang mie, but he was directly ignored by Jiang Taixu.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Wang Jue, you want to take advantage of my injuries to steal my monument Qi?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu looked at Wang Jue warily.</p><p>“Haha, brother Jiang, what kind of person do you think I, Wang Jue, am? Even if I have to fight with you, I won’t take advantage of you. Why? Did you really get besieged by the heavenly corpse sect?”</p><p>Wang Jue said.</p><p>“It’s not the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>“Would you believe me if I told you that I was defeated by a single person?” Jiang Taixu shook his head.</p><p>“What? Was he defeated by a single person? was it Luan Zhan, Dongfang Yu, or first ghost?”</p><p>Wang Jue’s expression changed drastically as he said a few names. These people were all as famous as them and were extremely powerful.</p><p>Jiang Taixu shook his head. neither. He’s a rising genius named Lu Ming and Wang Jue. I suggest we work together. Otherwise, we’re no match for him alone!</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming?”</p><p>Wang Jue’s eyes flickered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him?”</p><p>On the side, Wang mie’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Oh? I have forgotten that you seem to have a grudge with Lu Ming!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that little b * stard, is actually so powerful?”</p><p>Wang mie was in disbelief.</p><p>“Hehe, there’s nothing to lie about. You’re just lucky. If Lu Ming were to unleash his full power, he would only be able to kill you in a few moves!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu looked at Wang mie and chuckled.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect that you would lose to Lu Ming in a head-on battle!”</p><p>Wang Jue’s eyes were extremely solemn.</p><p>He was Jiang Taixu’s rival and he knew very well how terrifying Jiang Taixu was. If even Jiang Taixu had been defeated, then he was probably no match for Jiang Taixu either.</p><p>this person’s existence is a huge obstacle for us to fight for first place. Other than first place, what’s the difference between the other rankings? ”</p><p>Jiang Taixu said.</p><p>“Oh? Are you thinking of joining forces to get rid of Lu Ming together?”</p><p>Wang Jue said.</p><p>“That’s right. You guys should join forces and gather the other experts from the Jiang and Wang families. Also, aren’t some of Lu Ming’s friends here as well? That girlfriend of his is very pretty, and there’s also that trash from the golden sword sect. As long as we capture them, Lu Ming will definitely be wary. It will be much easier to kill him then.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu said with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Haha, Jiang Taixu, it seems like you’re really afraid of Lu Ming. Alright, I promise you. I’ll gather the people from the two families first, then capture Lu Ming’s friends. Then, I’ll wait for Lu Ming at the exit.”</p><p>Wang Jue laughed.</p><p>alright, let’s get moving. We’ll meet at the exit!</p><p>Jiang Taixu said with a cold face.</p><p>Wang Jue smiled and left with Wang mie.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll deal with you guys after I’m done with that Lu Ming bastard!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes were cold. He took out a few pills and swallowed them. Then he sat cross-legged and began to heal himself.</p><p>Two hours later, Jiang Taixu rose to his feet, transformed into a beam of light, and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>In the world of the heavenly stele, not even voice transmission Jade talismans could be used. If one wanted to find someone, they could only fly and try their luck.</p><p>However, many people from the Jiang family and the Wang family had come in. Gradually, some people had gathered. Jiang Taixu had even formed an alliance with Luan Zhan from the Luan family to kill Lu Ming together.</p><p>People from the three ancient families started to search for Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and the people from the metal sword sect.</p><p>This time, other than Jian feiliu, the golden sword sect had sent a total of twenty-nine people. However, only nine of them had successfully made it in.</p><p>Jin zhaokai was one of the nine. He had cultivated for more than eight hundred years and was an extremely powerful pinnacle King tier in the golden sword sect. However, at his age, the chances of breaking through the Spirit ocean realm were extremely small. However, the Heavenly King ranking was an opportunity, and he wanted to give it a try.</p><p>Now, he had already gathered seventy-two strands of Qi. Perhaps, there was still hope!</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly stopped. In front of him, three figures were walking over.</p><p>“Jiang Taixu!”</p><p>Jin zhaokai’s expression changed.</p><p>The leader of the three people in front was Jiang Taixu.</p><p>looking at the cultivation technique you’re cultivating, you’re from the metal sword sect, right? ”</p><p>Jiang Taixu asked with a gloomy face.</p><p>that’s right. I am from the golden sword sect. If young master Jiang needs the monument Qi, I am willing to offer it all!</p><p>Jin zhaokai had lost all hope when he encountered Jiang Taixu. He knew that he could not hold back the monument Qi this time. He could only exchange the monument Qi for his life.</p><p>“Offer the monument Qi? Hehe, wouldn’t I still get the Qi of the stele after killing you?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu laughed coldly. At the same time, he moved and pounced toward Jin zhaokai, revealing his sharp edge.</p><p>Jin zhaokai was shocked and retreated frantically. At the same time, he resisted with all his might, and the bright golden sword light slashed at Jiang Taixu.</p><p>But in the next moment, the sword light was broken. His body shook violently, and one of his arms was broken.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s palm pierced through Jin zhaokai’s heart.</p><p>“For … For … Why?”</p><p>Jin zhaokai’s eyes widened, full of unwillingness.</p><p>Normally speaking, as long as one offered the monument Qi, no one would be so ruthless.</p><p>This was because they were all from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, not the heavenly corpse sect or the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>“Why? If you want to blame someone, blame yourselves for being too close to that b * stard Lu Ming.”</p><p>With that, he burst forth with energy and Jin Zhao died.</p><p>Jiang Taixu waved his hand and put away Jin zhaokai’s golden sword. He said, ” “Let’s go and find the next one!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
