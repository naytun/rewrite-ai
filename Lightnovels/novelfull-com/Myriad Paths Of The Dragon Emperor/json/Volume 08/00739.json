The key point was that there were more than forty thousand people. It was too crowded. Everyone had to rush forward bravely in order to reach the stele.</p><p>Therefore, in this process, there would definitely be a fierce battle. One had to fight for the top spot in order to have a chance to enter the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>Everyone waited just like that. This wait lasted for half a day.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the Heavenly King tablet shook and shone with a bright light.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as Dongfang Hao finished his sentence, countless figures rose into the air and flew toward the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and the rest also rose into the air and flew forward.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>As soon as they flew above the abyss, a strong wind started blowing in the abyss. The strong wind was extremely sharp, like a sharp knife, slashing at everyone.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Some people’s expressions changed drastically as they were caught off guard and almost fell into the abyss with heavy injuries. They hurriedly used their Zhen Yuan to resist.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also released a vital essence shield to resist the surrounding strong winds. However, in this way, their speed was undoubtedly much slower. They could have flown across the abyss in the blink of an eye, but it would take a lot more time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Everyone stabilized their bodies, broke through the astral wind, and advanced at an extreme speed.</p><p>“Get lost, don’t block the way!”</p><p>Someone roared and attacked the person in front of him.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The people in front roared, and a great battle instantly broke out.</p><p>“Get lost, get out of the way!”</p><p>The roars rose and fell.</p><p>Everyone wanted to be the first to rush into the stele so that they could have the confidence to rush into the stele within the time for one incense stick to burn. If they all wanted to grab it, a battle was inevitable.</p><p>Above the abyss, a dazzling light burst out.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Someone screamed as he was shot down into the abyss. Suddenly, a sword light flashed in the abyss, and that person was cut in half. His corpse fell into the abyss.</p><p>There was a peerless killing formation below, and those who fell would die.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a cold killing intent surged toward Lu Ming and the others. At the same time, a series of attacks enveloped Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Wang mie, Wang Mang, you’re courting death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with killing intent. The ones who attacked them were Wang mie, Wang Mang, and some other elders.</p><p>These old men were all extremely powerful and were obviously experts from the Wang family.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest exploded and blocked the attacks from all directions.</p><p>“Damn it, how dare you sneak attack me, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Kong Jin roared as he swung his axe, destroying everything.</p><p>Five old men were caught by Fatty’s axe.</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hand and enveloped the five elders.</p><p>As for Jian feiliu, he was facing the two old men alone.</p><p>“You two, stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent the two elders flying with a single punch and charged towards Wang mie and Wang Mang.</p><p>The two men’s expressions changed drastically. They had sent out more than a dozen Wang family Masters, but they were all held back by Xie nianqing and his men. This was beyond their expectations.</p><p>Hmph, kid, this abyss will be your burial ground. Let’s kill him together!</p><p>Wang mie snorted coldly, his killing intent soaring. Together with Wang Mang, they pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>In addition, two other elders also charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared, and the spear light burst out. It contained the second level wind and thunder concepts. It was too fast and terrifying.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two large holes appeared in the chests of the two elders. They were pierced by Lu Ming’s spear gleam. They screamed in pain and fell into the abyss.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out horizontally. Wang mie and Wang Mang trembled and retreated quickly.</p><p>Wang mie was still fine, but Wang Mang’s eyes flashed with fear as he spat out a large mouthful of blood. The bone armor on one of his arms was completely shattered.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? The best plan is to leave!”</p><p>Wang mie didn’t even think and turned to leave.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Wang Mang realized that Wang mie had turned around and ran. In his shock, it was too late for him to leave. Lu Ming stepped forward and thrust his spear.</p><p>The spear radiance was extremely dazzling.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Wang Mang roared as he tried his best to block the attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s strength had improved greatly and had reached a terrifying level. Wang Mang could not stop him at all.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Wang Mang’s chest. With a shake, Wang Mang’s corpse fell into the abyss.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill the Wang family’s prodigy? you’re dead!”</p><p>In front of him, Wang mie roared but he did not dare to stop. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He realized that he was no match for him at all. If he stayed, he would definitely die.</p><p>“I will definitely kill you in the Heavenly King tablet!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>At this time, the elders who had surrounded Xie nianqing and the others were either dead or had escaped. They had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>At the side, when the others saw the terrifying combat strength of Lu Ming and the rest, they were shocked and did not dare to attack them.</p><p>The four of them charged forward together, and those who were in their way were sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and found that Jiang Taixu, the corpse King, and some of the most powerful people had already rushed to the front. Those who stood in their way were all killed in one move.</p><p>In the end, they rushed into the divine King’s tablet and disappeared.</p><p>After about half an incense’s time, Lu Ming and the rest also rushed into the stele and disappeared.</p><p>Soon, the time for one incense stick to burn had passed and the light on the Heavenly King stele disappeared. Those who rushed in again could no longer enter the Heavenly King stele. They could only sigh outside and fly back to the other side of the abyss.</p><p>They had already lost their chance.</p><p>Out of the 40000 people, at least a few thousand fell into the abyss, and about 10000 rushed into the Heavenly King monument. The rest stayed outside.</p><p>In addition to those who were eliminated in the first round, there were more than 100000 people gathered at the edge of the abyss.</p><p>“Let’s see what’s going on inside!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Dongfang Hao said. He then joined hands with enlightened three corpse, and beams of light entered the Heavenly King stele. In the next moment, an image appeared on the stele.</p><p>“That’s Jiang Taixu!”</p><p>On the screen, Jiang Taixu could be seen flying rapidly in the sky above an empty land.</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Hao waved his hand, and the scene changed into another one.</p><p>A young man in a red robe killed an old man with one punch. Above him and the old man’s heads, there was a stone stele shadow. There were three wisps of Qi in the stone stele. At this time, the Qi from the stone stele above the old man’s head all flew towards the young man in red robe. The stone stele above the young man in red robe turned into six wisps of Qi.</p><p>that’s Wang Jue, the pride of the Wang family. He was ranked eighth among the ten Heavenly Kings last year!</p><p>Many people recognized this young man.</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Hao waved his hand again, and the scene changed.</p><p>The Heavenly King tablet could actually display the scene inside.</p><p>Lu Ming felt the world flash and he appeared in a desolate desert. Above his head, there was a floating shadow of the Heavenly King stele. There were three gray gases swimming inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
