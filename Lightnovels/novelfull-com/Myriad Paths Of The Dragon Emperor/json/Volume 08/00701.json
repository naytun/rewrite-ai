Brother Lu and I will come soon!</p><p>...</p><p>Chi Yue said to elder Chi Xu.</p><p>“But young lady …”</p><p>Elder Chi Xu was about to object, but when he saw Chi Yue’s wide eyes, he knew that he couldn’t persuade this stubborn young lady. He could only return to the tribe first.</p><p>“Lu Ming, during the short fight with you just now, I saw that you understood inscriptions and inscription arrays. You should be quite knowledgeable, right?”</p><p>Chi Yue suddenly asked, a hint of hope flashing in her eyes.</p><p>“It’s alright, I guess!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Kid, what do you mean by” not bad “? The inscriptions and formations that this Lord has given you are almost all that this Lord has taught you. Who else in this world has more inscriptions than this Lord?”</p><p>Dandan immediately shouted in displeasure.</p><p>“Eh? A little turtle like you can actually talk?”</p><p>Red Moon was startled at first, then her eyes widened as she looked at dandan curiously.</p><p>“Of course I can speak. If even you can speak, why can’t I? you’re so strange.”</p><p>Dandan pouted and looked at Red Moon in disdain.</p><p>Red moon’s mouth directly opened into an ‘O’ shape, and he looked at dandan in a daze, his eyes shining.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled wryly. During this period of time, Lu Ming had discovered that there were demonic beasts in this underground world. However, the demonic beasts had extremely low intelligence. Martial King realm demonic beasts were slightly better than ordinary wild beasts. They could not speak at all. No wonder Chi Yue was so surprised.</p><p>Red moon’s eyes widened as she looked at dandan curiously.</p><p>“Beauty, are you convinced by this Lord’s spirit? let me tell you, this Lord is the head of the top ten Battle Beasts, unrivaled in the world, revered in the universe, and unrivaled!”</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder, her two front claws on the turtle shell, looking like an unparalleled master.</p><p>But the next moment, dandan collapsed.</p><p>Red Moon reached out and grabbed dandan’s head, placing it in front of her eyes and carefully examining it.</p><p>“I’m so angry!”</p><p>Dandan’s four short legs kicked and flew out of Chi Yue’s hand, landing on Lu Ming’s shoulder. Its eyes were wide open, and it wanted to eat Chi Yue.</p><p>Chi Yue laughed heartily, very forthright.</p><p>He then turned to Lu Ming. Lu Ming, if you know a lot of inscriptions and formations, you might be able to do our tribe a huge favor. By then, the elders of our tribe will definitely treat you like an ancestor. They’ll definitely agree to any conditions you have!</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“This matter has to start from the current situation of our red leopard tribe …”</p><p>Chi Yue and Lu Ming began to talk.</p><p>In the underground world, the battle between the tribes was endless.</p><p>60 years ago, the red leopard tribe was still an extremely powerful tribe. The tribe had many experts and was very powerful. They occupied large areas of rich land.</p><p>At that time, the chief of the red leopard tribe was a renowned expert who had already reached the peak of the divine level, which was the peak of the sixth level.</p><p>But later, the Chiefs of the heavenly Wolf tribe, the yin snake tribe, and the blood Tiger Tribe joined forces to launch a sneak attack on the red leopard tribe’s chief. In the end, the red leopard tribe’s chief was severely injured and sealed in a Canyon. The red leopard tribe’s chief died in that Canyon.</p><p>Not only that, but the red leopard tribe leader also carried the most exquisite inscription secret manual of the red leopard tribe, which was the foundation of the red leopard tribe. Without the inscription secret manual, the follow-up power of the red leopard tribe became weaker and weaker. In the past 60 years, the territory occupied by the red leopard tribe was less than 20% of what it was in the past. If it were not for the support of some elders, it was estimated that the red leopard tribe would have been exterminated by the three major tribes.</p><p>As for the seal on the canyon, it was set up by the three tribe leaders. It was extremely complicated, and the inscription formation was unique to the three tribes. Unless the three tribe leaders worked together to break it, the red leopard tribe would not be able to break it.</p><p>Therefore, when Chi Yue saw that Lu Ming knew so many inscriptions and formations, she wanted him to give it a try. If Lu Ming could break the seal and take out the secret inscription refining manual of the red leopard tribe, then wouldn’t the elders of the red leopard tribe treat Lu Ming like their ancestor?</p><p>“Alright, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. If he wanted to be valued by the other party and if he could give the other party a little favor, it would be the best.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Chi Yue was overjoyed. She brought Lu Ming to the place where the previous tribe leader of the red leopard tribe was sealed.</p><p>According to Chi Yue, that place was very close to the red leopard tribe’s city, only a hundred li away.</p><p>It was a huge mountain range. There were huge mountain peaks that pierced the sky. They were steep and majestic.</p><p>There were two huge mountain peaks in between, forming a Canyon about ten meters wide in the middle. This Canyon was the place where the red leopard tribe’s previous chief was sealed.</p><p>There were experts from the red leopard tribe guarding this place.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Chi Yue arrived at the entrance of the valley, they saw dozens of figures guarding the entrance.</p><p>“Chi Yue, huh? It’s you? How dare you! Men, kill this person for me!”</p><p>They had just reached the entrance of the valley when they heard a loud shout.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Stop!”</p><p>Chi Yue shouted, and the others, who were about to make a move, stopped.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. The one who called for a fight was a young man. It was Chi Feng, who he had previously held hostage.</p><p>Chi Feng’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at Lu Ming, then at Chi Yue,”Chi Yue, why are you protecting him? This person has killed many of our red leopard tribe’s people. He should be executed on the spot for his crime!”</p><p>“Chi Feng, the clan elders have said long ago that we should be polite to the people from the outer realm. We should invite them instead of fighting. You were the one who started it first, so Lu Ming naturally resisted. You can’t blame him for this. To cut off the only chance for the red leopard tribe to rise?”</p><p>Chi Yue was very strong, staring at Chi Feng and loudly questioning.</p><p>“Chi Yue … I didn’t mean that!”</p><p>Chi Feng’s voice lowered.</p><p>“Alright, Feng ‘er, since the other party has come to the red leopard tribe, he is a guest of the red leopard tribe. You don’t have to say anything more!”</p><p>On the side, a long-bearded man in his fifties walked over and said.</p><p>“Sixth uncle!”</p><p>Chi Yue called out and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming at the same time. This person was Chi Feng’s father, her sixth uncle, and also the person in charge of guarding this Canyon, pure gold Mountain.</p><p>“En, Yue ‘er, why did you bring this little brother here? This is the tribe’s forbidden area.”</p><p>Chi Jinshan said.</p><p>“Sixth uncle, Lu Ming comes from the outer world and is an extremely talented inscriber. He has mastered many inscriptions and formations that our red leopard tribe does not have. He might be able to break the seal here and take out the secret inscription manual inside. So, I brought him here to give it a try.”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>Hearing this, pure gold Mountain’s face sank, ” “Yue ‘er, this place is the red leopard tribe’s forbidden area. How can we allow an outsider to break in? this is simply nonsense. Alright, you should all leave quickly!”</p><p>Pure gold Mountain waved his hand.</p><p>“Sixth uncle, taking out the red leopard tribe’s Secret inscription refining manual concerns the rise and fall of the red leopard tribe. It’s of great importance. Maybe he can really crack it?”</p><p>Chi Yue didn’t give in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
