They must be killed!”</p><p>The old man in the lead revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were all at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, but when the three of them joined forces, their coordination was seamless. They were actually able to fight against three experts at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, which was truly shocking.</p><p>there shouldn’t be any problems. Let’s attack together and end the battle quickly. After a long time, we might attract other people’s attention!</p><p>The old man in the lead spoke.</p><p>The battle had caused a huge commotion. If any other powerful cultivators passed by and their identities were exposed, the Shangguan family would have a hard time explaining themselves to the outside world.</p><p>At this time, if the younger generation was defeated and the older generation was sent to assassinate them, then the geniuses from the other regions would not dare to come to ninedragons to compete with the geniuses. If they accidentally hit the geniuses of the big families, and the older generation was sent to assassinate them, then who would dare to come?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The others shouted coldly and charged into the valley together.</p><p>The powerful aura and cold killing intent sent chills down Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>There were at least five experts at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier, and their battle prowess completely crushed them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He shouted, ” charge! Charge out!</p><p>They tried their best to charge out, but the three sixth level spiritual ocean tier experts blocked them with all their might.</p><p>In the next moment, more than a dozen black-robed men all landed in the valley.</p><p>“Three little brats, I’ll send you on your way. In your next life, remember to keep a low profile. There are some people you can’t offend.”</p><p>The leading old man said.</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? In my eyes, the Shangguan family is nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed drastically as he said,”you …” They know about us?”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you. Now, let me send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and took a step forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Instantly, the entire Valley shone brightly. Inscriptions of various colors appeared on the ground and walls. They were dazzling.</p><p>not good, we’ve been tricked! Retreat!</p><p>The old man shouted.</p><p>“It’s too late, kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. Endless sword Qi condensed and shot toward the elder and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming had spent a few hours on this sword aura thunderous array. Although it could not unleash its full power, it was still much more powerful than the one he had hastily carved at the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>Moreover, there were 11 other formations to assist him.</p><p>The vines rushed out and wrapped around the Shangguan clan’s men. Then, sword Qi, saber Qi, and spear light all shot toward them.</p><p>Puchi! Puchi!</p><p>Ten experts at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier were killed in an instant.</p><p>Only five experts at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean tier were still struggling to hold on. They wanted to break out of the encirclement, but they couldn’t charge out at all.</p><p>All sorts of great formations covered them.</p><p>The twelve major arrays that Lu Ming set up were not just for attacking. They were also for trapping enemies.</p><p>Very quickly, the five-man Mountain was covered in blood as it was cut by the sword Qi.</p><p>ah! The Shangguan family will never let you off!</p><p>The old man in the lead let out an unwilling roar.</p><p>However, not long after, they followed in the footsteps of their predecessors and were killed here.</p><p>Fifteen experts at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier and above were completely annihilated.</p><p>these people have a lot of top-grade spiritual crystals. Let’s find a place to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He grabbed the storage rings of the 15 people and devoured their blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of these 15 people was too strong. He had a feeling that he couldn’t control it, and he urgently needed to find a place to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and flames appeared, burning the fifteen corpses into ashes. Then, the three of them left the place and flew into the distance.</p><p>After 200,000 miles, they found a hidden cave and walked in.</p><p>take a look at these storage rings. I’m going to start cultivating!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and focused on refining the blood essence.</p><p>Previously, in the great battle with the Wang, Jiang, and Luan families at the hundred venerated mountain, he had killed six experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier and refined their blood essence.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that the prison-suppressing stele bloodline was getting closer and closer to advancing.</p><p>It was as if he could already see the level of the divine bloodline.</p><p>While Lu Ming was refining the blood essence with all his might, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were also cultivating.</p><p>Fifteen martial artists, the lowest at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and five at the seventh level. The power of blood essence was too strong.</p><p>It was constantly refined and gushed into the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele. In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>This time, the refinement took three days.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline started to shake crazily. The nine silver chakra glowed with a dazzling light like nine silver Suns.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin both opened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Suddenly, their eyes widened and their mouths opened wide.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s mouth was wide open enough to swallow a large lamb leg.</p><p>The nine silver chakras on the prison-suppressing stele were slowly gathering towards the bottom. At first, two chakras merged together, then three chakras merged together …</p><p>In the end, the nine silver chakras merged together. When they did, they emitted a golden light instead of a silver light.</p><p>At the same time, the size of the prison-suppressing stele also expanded rapidly, becoming more majestic and tall. On it, there was a primitive, ancient, and heavy aura, as if it had come from the ancient times, crossing time and space, giving people a strong pressure.</p><p>The clouds and mist above it had also become lighter, allowing people to see the lines on the prison-suppressing stele more clearly.</p><p>A golden chakra was circling the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“God … God … The divine bloodline has been upgraded to the divine bloodline!”</p><p>Kong Jin looked on in a daze, dumbfounded.</p><p>Xie nianqing was still fine because she had long known that Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian would level up. Although she was shocked, she did not lose her composure.</p><p>finally, I’ve upgraded to a divine bloodline!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. There was a strange feeling in his heart. He felt that he could turn into a prison-suppressing stele at any time and suppress all his enemies.</p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn’t wait any longer. Suddenly, he felt that he had turned into a light and entered the prison-suppressing stele. At this moment, the aura of the prison-suppressing stele grew.</p><p>An even more wonderful feeling was born. Lu Ming felt as if he was a prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he could still cast the prison-suppressing heaven technique even if he transformed into the prison-suppressing stele. Moreover, its power was much stronger than his.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the prison-suppressing stele shrunk and finally turned into Lu Ming’s figure on the ground.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, your Blood Meridian can actually be upgraded. Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>Kong Jin’s fat body seemed to be weightless. He appeared beside Lu Ming in a flash. His small eyes widened to the maximum. He circled Lu Ming and swept his gaze around.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
