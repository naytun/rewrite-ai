Lu Ming saw nine silver chakras at one glance.</p><p>King level ninth rank bloodline.</p><p>How was that possible? Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>Jian feiliu was even more shocked.</p><p>They had fought together before, so they knew that Xie nianqing’s bloodline was a seventh level King-tier bloodline. But now, it had become a ninth level King-tier bloodline. It was incredible.</p><p>not bad, not bad. This bloodline is indeed powerful. I wonder what level the third bloodline is at? ”</p><p>Lian Cang looked at Xie nianqing and nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><p>it seems that the nine Dragon bloodline is not the only wondrous bloodline in the world.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The world was full of wonders. In the past, the place he lived in was too small. When he stepped onto a broader stage, he would definitely see more wonderful things. There were all kinds of bloodlines, and the nine Dragon bloodline was not the only one that could be upgraded.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s bloodline was able to advance to the ninth level of the king realm through the rebirth of his bloodline.</p><p>A ninth-level King bloodline was the highest level a second bloodline could reach. If one wanted to reach the divine level, they would usually have to go for the third bloodline.</p><p>After a while, the silver light disappeared and the blood vessels behind Xie nianqing disappeared into her body. She opened her eyes.</p><p>alright, now, step onto the altar and I’ll send you out!</p><p>Said Lian Cang.</p><p>Jian feiliu and Xie nianqing walked up to the altar while Lu Ming came to Lian Cang and bowed, ” “Master, disciple will take his leave.”</p><p>yes, go. I can’t help you in the future. You have to rely on yourself!</p><p>Liao Cang nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart ached. Although he had not spent a long time with Lian Cang, Lu Ming had indeed regarded him as his true master.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this was the first master that Lu Ming had formally acknowledged.</p><p>Lu Ming knew very well that this farewell might be an eternal farewell. With Lian Cang’s soul power, he would not be able to last for more than a few years.</p><p>The Emperor of a generation had ended up in such a state. It really made one sigh.</p><p>Lu Ming bowed again and stepped onto the altar.</p><p>Lian Cang waved his hands and the altar began to shine. Inscriptions appeared and the next moment, the world started to spin.</p><p>When their surroundings had stabilized, they opened their eyes.</p><p>With the sea breeze blowing in all directions, they arrived at a small island. This place should be one of the small islands in the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you, miss. Thank you!”</p><p>Jian feiliu cupped his fists at Lu Ming to express his gratitude.</p><p>This time, only three people came out. He knew very well that the others would probably stay underground forever. The only reason he could come out was definitely because of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>He was extremely grateful. If he was to stay underground forever, it would be worse than death.</p><p>“There’s no need to thank me, brother Jian!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Xie, what are your plans from now on?”</p><p>Jian feiliu asked.</p><p>we’ve come out to train and improve our cultivation. After the battle of Providence starts, we’ll head to the sky martial region!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The sky martial region was where the main palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace was located.</p><p>Oh, if that’s the case, why don’t you return to the golden sword sect with me, and then head to the Heavenly King domain? the Heavenly King ranking battle is about to begin. To all peak-tier Kings, this is an indispensable opportunity!</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“The battle of the Heavenly Kings ranking?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Other than the battle of Providence, why was there another battle of the Heavenly Kings list?</p><p>“Brother Lu, you don’t know about the Heavenly King ranking battle?”</p><p>Jian feiliu was a bit dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He really did not know.</p><p>“Alright! In the Heavenly King domain, there are two Heavenly King steles that open once every three years. The Heavenly King steles have a miraculous effect on peak-tier Kings, and many people have broken through to the sea of soul realm because of them.”</p><p>however, there is a limit to the number of places that can obtain the final opportunity. There are only 108 spots. However, there are countless peak King tiers in the eastern barren territory. Everyone wants these 108 spots, so it triggered a series of fights. This is the battle for the Heavenly King ranking.</p><p>now, the battle of the Heavenly King ranking is not only for the one hundred and eight spots, but also for the ranking of the Kings. It is a kind of glory to determine the strongest King. Among them, the top ten on the Heavenly King ranking are known as the ten Heavenly Kings.</p><p>Jian feiliu explained in detail.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He roughly understood.</p><p>This meant that they had to compete for both the ranking and the opportunity.</p><p>the battle of the Heavenly Kings ranking is extremely intense. Since there’s no age limit, many old monsters who have cultivated for almost a thousand years will be dispatched. There are many experts. Those old monsters may have limited potential, but after accumulating for so many years, their combat strength is extremely terrifying. Many geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents are no match for them.</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>alright, we’ll go to the golden sword sect with you first, then head to the Heavenly King domain!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately made a decision.</p><p>His wind, fire, and Thunder intent realms were all stuck at the limit of the first level. Perhaps the battle of the sky King List would be an opportunity for him to break through.</p><p>Without breaking through the Spirit sea, it was almost impossible to stand out in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded as well. Although she had heard of the Heavenly King ranking battle, it was only hearsay. She was also quite curious.</p><p>Then, the three of them rose into the air and flew toward the West.</p><p>The golden light region, where the golden sword sect is located, is located to the West of the chaotic Astral Ocean.</p><p>After flying for a day, the three of them arrived at a large island. They matched the map to their current location.</p><p>It should be a ten-day journey from the golden light region.</p><p>“Let’s ride the puppets!”</p><p>With a wave of Lu Ming’s hand, a giant snake puppet appeared. This giant snake puppet was fifty meters long and had a combat strength equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. It came from the yin snake tribe.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming brought quite a number of puppets back.</p><p>Jian feiliu was shocked when he saw Lu Ming take out the giant serpent puppet and felt the powerful aura it exuded.</p><p>I didn’t expect brother Lu to be so powerful in both martial arts and inscription!</p><p>Jian feiliu sighed.</p><p>To be able to control a puppet that was equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was definitely extremely terrifying. Needless to say, he was definitely a true inscription Alchemist.</p><p>At this age, not only was his martial arts so terrifying, but he had also reached such a realm in the Dao of inscription. Jian feiliu wailed in his heart. Was he still human?</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>The giant serpent puppet was very large, and there was a lot of space for the three of them to ride on.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The giant snake puppet flapped its wings, and a strong gust of wind blew. They transformed into streaks of light and flew forward.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>After exiting the ground, he discovered that the speed of the giant snake puppet was many times faster than when it was underground. As expected, its speed was completely suppressed when it was underground.</p><p>Flying became many times more difficult, and once they were out of the ground, it was as if they were suddenly freed from their shackles and were free to fly in the sky.</p><p>The giant snake puppet’s flying speed was even faster than their flying speed. It was truly equivalent to a fourth level spiritual ocean tier cultivator hurrying on their way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
