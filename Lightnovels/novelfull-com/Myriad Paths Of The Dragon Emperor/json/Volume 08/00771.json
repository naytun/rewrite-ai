That Fatty’s battle power is indeed equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He can actually fight to a draw with Six-Fingered cultivator, how terrifying!”</p><p>also, the battle formation of the sea Cloud sect is so powerful and mysterious. It’s a pure defensive battle formation. The cooperation of eight people is flawless, and they actually blocked the attack of the red moon sect.</p><p>can you guys tell? those two youths aren’t simple either. They’re at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm and have battle prowess at the peak of the second level. They’re Almost heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“How did the sea Cloud sect manage to invite such people?”</p><p>The surroundings were abuzz with discussion.</p><p>However, they had no idea that Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin had suppressed their combat strength.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had only erupted with combat power at the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>With the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, he was able to burst out the combat power of the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. This was already comparable to some of the worst prodigies, such as Qin Qingshan and Gao Qiang.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and the other two were not Ordinary Geniuses.</p><p>Xie nianqing and the other two had each comprehended at least one powerful special intent realm, and they had at least fused two of them together. In addition, they had their powerful bloodline martial techniques and cultivation techniques, which were all extraordinary. In addition, they had all cultivated the secret skill super spirit sea, which doubled the size of their spirit sea.</p><p>Each of them had terrifying battle power, and it wasn’t hard for them to kill a normal fourth level spiritual ocean realm warrior.</p><p>The two sides exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>At this moment, Kong Jin roared repeatedly like a ferocious beast. He slashed wildly with his giant axe and gradually gained the upper hand.</p><p>Another few dozen moves.</p><p>Six-Fingered cultivator spat out a mouthful of blood. His chest was swept by the axe, and a deep bloody mark appeared. He was almost cut in half.</p><p>He turned pale with fright, and cold sweat poured down his back as he frantically retreated!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Kong Jin carried his battle axe and gave chase.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With another move, Six-Fingered itinerant’s body was sent flying out of the fighting ring by Kong Jin’s axe.</p><p>He flew out of the fighting ring and was considered defeated.</p><p>“You’re lucky!”</p><p>Kong Jin laughed hideously. He raised his battle-axe and charged toward the other members of the Crimson Moon sect.</p><p>we admit defeat! We admit defeat!</p><p>Seeing that Six-Fingered had been defeated, the other people from the red moon sect immediately admitted defeat and didn’t dare to fight again.</p><p>With the red moon sect’s surrender, the sea Cloud sect won the first round of the ranking battle.</p><p>“How boring!”</p><p>Kong Jin returned to his seat, took out a large lamb leg, and started munching on it.</p><p>haha, I’ve said it before. You said it too early.</p><p>Qiao long sneered as he looked at the sect leader of Crimson Moon sect.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The sect leader of the red moon sect snorted coldly with a gloomy face.</p><p>the sea Cloud sect’s strategy is very simple. They rely on that defensive formation to defend themselves. In terms of offense, they completely rely on that fatty. That Fatty’s battle power is slightly stronger than Six-Fingered’s. As long as there’s an expert stronger than Six-Fingered holding that fatty back, or even having two experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier to defeat that fatty, the sea Cloud sect will definitely lose.</p><p>that’s right. The key is that fatty. He’s not easy to deal with. This time, if nothing goes wrong, the sea Cloud sect will have no problem entering the top six. Qiao Long’s luck is really good. He actually managed to invite such a heaven’s favorite!</p><p>The leaders of the other forces were quietly discussing.</p><p>In the wind sword sect area, ye fa and the others were also discussing.</p><p>“Ancestor, seniors, if we encounter the sea Cloud sect, do we have a chance of winning?”</p><p>Ye fa sent a message to the wind sword sect Grandmaster and the Qing He twin monsters.</p><p>faction leader ye, don’t worry. My cultivation is stronger than Six-Fingered cultivator’s, so I can suppress that fatty. With younger brother ye, we can kill that fatty. Then, we will win!</p><p>The great Dao of the Qinghe twins, the little brother ye he was referring to, was the wind sword sect’s old ancestor.</p><p>it’s going to be difficult to completely annihilate the sea Cloud sect. As long as we kill that fatty, the others will definitely admit defeat, and we won’t be able to kill more people.</p><p>The boss of the Qing He twin monsters continued.</p><p>“It’s not bad to kill that fatty!” Ye fa nodded.</p><p>He looked in the direction of the sea Cloud sect. He didn’t know why, but he still felt uncertain.</p><p>He was worried about Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had already displayed combat strength at the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean realm, he was still uncertain.</p><p>He was already at the early second level of the spiritual ocean tier, but last time, at the wind sword sect, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing gave him a very strong pressure. He could vaguely sense that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s combat strength was not just at the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>But even if he reached the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, what was the use? If the Qing He twin monsters and the old ancestor killed the fatty, they would definitely win.</p><p>Ye fa warned himself in his heart.</p><p>The competition continued. Soon, the first round was over and they entered the second round.</p><p>When he encountered the forces of intentionless mansion, he still admitted defeat directly.</p><p>“The wind sword sect against the sea Cloud sect!”</p><p>Suddenly, the judge’s voice was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin were the same.</p><p>He did not expect to meet the wind sword sect in the second Battle. What luck.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you confident?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The wind sword sect had two experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier!</p><p>“Don’t worry, you don’t think I’m worse than this fatty, do you?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>Kong Jin pursed his lips but did not refute.</p><p>“Tingting, just watch. We’ll kill the two monsters of Qinghe in this battle!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at ruan Tingting.</p><p>“You guys be careful!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said softly.</p><p>“Let’s go, time to go on stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew up to the fighting ring with Kong Jin and the rest.</p><p>The wind sword sect disciples also ascended the stage.</p><p>“I advise you to admit defeat as soon as possible, hehe!”</p><p>The boss of the Qing He twin monsters sneered as he stared at Xie nianqing with a burning gaze.</p><p>I say, old man, hurry up and admit defeat. Wait a minute, my axe doesn’t recognize people!</p><p>Kong Jin laughed coldly as he waved the battle axe in his hand.</p><p>fatty, little Qing, follow the plan. I’ll take care of the two monsters of Qing He. Leave the wind sword sect patriarch to fatty. Little Qing, you’re in charge of keeping the others quiet!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Kong Jin and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them nodded.</p><p>“Hehe, if that’s the case, then go to hell!”</p><p>The two monsters of Qing He revealed a cold killing intent. Their bodies flashed and they pounced towards Kong Jin.</p><p>At the same time, the wind sword sect’s Grandmaster pounced towards Kong Jin while the others pounced towards Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, everyone saw a figure flash and suddenly appear in front of the boss of the two monsters of Qinghe.</p><p>“Old man, I’ll send you on your way today!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Just you? die!”</p><p>The two monsters of Qing He shouted coldly and struck a palm at Lu Ming. The eruption of the cultivation of the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge explosion was heard. The boss of the Qing He twin monsters trembled and took two steps back.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The leader of the Qing He twin monsters looked at Lu Ming in shock. How could Lu Ming be so powerful that he could force him to retreat with one palm?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
