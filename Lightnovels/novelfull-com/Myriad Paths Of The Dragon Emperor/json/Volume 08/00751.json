The divine King monument does not prohibit killing. They died in battle because they were incompetent. However, let me ask you, one person is an ancient family. Have you ever said this?”</p><p>Wang Yan stood in mid-air, purple flames shimmering as a terrifying temperature emanated from him.</p><p>The people nearby kept retreating, unable to withstand the terrifying temperature.</p><p>“I did!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was simple and clear.</p><p>“Hahaha, laughable, truly laughable!”</p><p>Wang Yan laughed out loud, his eyes shining as though two small Suns had appeared in them.”You’re really stupid and ignorant. Do you know what an ancient family represents? He actually said that he is comparable to an ancient family. He really doesn’t know the immensity of the heavens and earth!”</p><p>“That’s right. You think that you’re so arrogant just because you have some combat strength, but in fact, you’re just an ignorant fool. No matter how strong you are, you’re just a martial King. A martial King can only do odd jobs in the ancient family. There are countless people in the ancient family who can kill you. Any one of them can suppress you with a single palm strike.”</p><p>Jiang Taichong also sneered.</p><p>“I can’t do it now, but that doesn’t mean I can’t do it in the future!” Lu Ming’s gaze was firm, persistent, and full of confidence.</p><p>“Future? Let me tell you, in the eyes of the true geniuses of the East continent, the so-called Heavenly King ranking battle is just a child’s play, not worth mentioning. The real competition among the eastern continent’s geniuses is above the martial King realm. The battle of Providence in a year’s time is the real battlefield of the geniuses, and you don’t even have the right to interfere!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s voice was filled with faint disdain.</p><p>Wang Yan, there’s no need to waste your breath on them. I’ll let them understand right now how insignificant they are in front of the ancient family. They’re even less than ants!</p><p>Jiang Taichong took a step forward, and the aura on his body exploded with a bang. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>It was as if countless divine swords had gathered around his body, emitting sharp glints. Each glinted was a divine sword that pressed down on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the others trembled violently. Their protective true energy was completely useless as it was directly pierced through by the sharp light. It was as if their bodies were going to be pierced through with holes.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong. Jiang Taichong was definitely not an ordinary spiritual ocean tier warrior. He had already walked a long way in the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Ming and the rest were, they were only at the martial King realm. The difference was too great, so great that they could not resist.</p><p>no matter how strong a martial King is, he’s still an ant in front of absolute strength!</p><p>Jiang Taichong looked down at the crowd, his voice cold and aloof.</p><p>“I will definitely kill you in the battle of karmic luck!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. Four-colored concepts surrounded him as he tried his best to resist.</p><p>“Killing me in the battle of Providence? what a joke!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong sneered, and the aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly King tablet’s shadow above Lu Ming’s head suddenly shook and emitted a bright light.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, and Jian feiliu’s Heavenly King stele shadows also trembled and shone brightly. The four people’s lights gathered together.</p><p>At this moment, behind the four of them, opposite the abyss, the Heavenly King stele was also glowing. A huge shadow of the Heavenly King stele suddenly appeared above the four of them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Heavenly King stele’s shadow shook and dispersed Jiang Taichong’s aura. Jiang Taixu took a few steps back and looked at the huge Heavenly King stele’s shadow with an ugly expression.</p><p>Their pressure had caused the Heavenly King tablet to move.</p><p>A terrifying aura erupted from Wang Yan’s body and pressed forward. However, he immediately followed in Jiang Taichong’s footsteps and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“The divine monument’s protection, Hmph!”</p><p>Jiang Taichong snorted coldly.</p><p>you’re lucky this time, Lu Ming. If you’re really confident, go to the sky martial region or ninedragons. By then, you’ll understand the true strength of the ancient families. You’ll also understand what a true heaven’s favorite is and how insignificant you are!</p><p>Wang Yan swept a glance at Lu Ming and the rest as he spoke indifferently. With that, he turned around, took a step forward, and disappeared.</p><p>Jiang Taichong also turned around and left.</p><p>This time, they did not really intend to make a move on Lu Ming and the rest. Just as the crowd had guessed, with their cultivation, they could suppress Lu Ming and the rest with one hand. The difference was too great.</p><p>If they made a move, they would instead end up with a reputation of bullying the weak.</p><p>They only wanted to intimidate Lu Ming and the rest, to let them and everyone else understand the dignity and power of the ancient families.</p><p>At the same time, it also proved their own strength. No matter how strong a martial King was, he was still a martial King. They were all under thirty years old, but they had already gone far beyond the level of a martial King.</p><p>Now that they had achieved their goal, they naturally left.</p><p>“Hmph, is the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents that great? I’ll surpass them one by one sooner or later!”</p><p>Kong Jin snorted coldly in dissatisfaction. He took out a lamb leg and started gnawing on it.</p><p>He wondered how many roast lamb legs this guy had in reserve.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word, but his eyes revealed a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Before he had the ability, it was useless to say anything. However, as Kong Jin had said, he would surpass them one day. Lu Ming believed that that day would not be too far away.</p><p>One person was comparable to an ancient family. This was only Lu Ming’s initial goal and he had to achieve it. If he could not even do this, how could he compete with the number one Martial Emperor?</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll cultivate on the Heavenly King’s tablet’s steps!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and strode forward.</p><p>The four of them walked towards the first Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>When he arrived at the bottom of the Heavenly King tablet, he realized that there were already some people on it.</p><p>The corpse King was sitting cross-legged on the 26th step.</p><p>Wang Jue, first ghost, and a few others were sitting cross-legged on the 25th step.</p><p>There were a total of 27 steps on the Heavenly King stele.</p><p>The 21st to 27th steps were dark red and were the rewards for the top 108 on the Heavenly King List. Only they could go up.</p><p>Only the first place could go up to the highest twenty-seventh step.</p><p>The 26th step could be reached by the second to fourth place.</p><p>On the 25th step, the 5th to 10th place would be able to go up.</p><p>On the 24th step, the 11th to 20th place can go up.</p><p>…….</p><p>The last 38 would be able to reach the 21st step.</p><p>The 108 spots were distributed on the seven steps.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and flew to the top of the stairs. Above his head, the Heavenly King stele’s illusionary shadow scattered down rays of light that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Without the protection of the Heavenly King stele, only death awaited them if they ascended the dark red steps.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the highest step. In an instant, he felt an extremely strong sense of all kinds of concepts. He even felt that there were experts fighting and cultivating.</p><p>There was an imprint left behind by a Supreme expert on the Heavenly King stele.</p><p>No one knew when the Heavenly King stele was left behind. It had been standing there for countless years. Throughout history, many martial Royal realm experts had wanted to move it away and take it for themselves, but none of them had been able to do so.</p><p>That was why he had stayed here.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat cross-legged, captured various concepts, and began to comprehend them.</p><p>The various traces of intent here were much stronger than the stairs below.</p><p>Lu Ming was the first to capture a wisp of the concept of fire. In an instant, the world changed. He saw a tall figure practicing the concept of fire. His every movement was extremely mysterious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
