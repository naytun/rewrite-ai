Sect master, if you want help, you can ask someone else. Why must you ask the two monsters of clear river?”</p><p>...</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Someone else? Then what kind of expert can you invite, tell me?” Ye fa sneered.</p><p>I have a few friends with extremely high cultivation and powerful combat strength. You can ask them to help us!</p><p>Ruan Tingting thought of Lu Ming, Kong Jin, and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Hahaha, ruan Tingting, you’re not talking about the boys who live in your courtyard, are you?” Beside him, sullo burst out laughing.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s them!” Ruan Tingting said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Kong Jin and Lu Ming could easily crush the two elders of the Miao family who were at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier. Their combat strength was definitely above the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. Ruan Tingting thought that if she begged them, Kong Jin and the others might agree.</p><p>“Hehe, what a joke. What can those few kids do to help us? Are you a burden to us? That girl is pretty, as beautiful as a fairy. Do you want her to use her beauty as a trap? haha!”</p><p>Sullo laughed out loud.</p><p>Hmph, she’s just trying to find a reason to shirk her responsibility. She doesn’t care about the sect at all, she only cares about herself! Ye Qing coldly said.</p><p>“Alright, the two seniors of Mount Clear river are at the peak of the fourth and third level of the spiritual ocean realm. Where can we find such combat power? Only finding them is the safest. This matter is settled!”</p><p>Ye fa said.</p><p>“No, I don’t agree. Sect master, you know what kind of people the two monsters of Qing He are. They are two old monsters. Who knows how many innocent girls have died at their hands.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shook her head.</p><p>“Nonsense, the two seniors of Qinghe mountain are not that kind of people. You must agree to this!”</p><p>Ye FA’s face darkened as he scolded.</p><p>that’s right, ruan Tingting. Those are two powerful people in the spiritual ocean tier. It’s your fortune to be able to marry them. This is also a benefit that the sect fought for for you. It’s fine if you don’t thank them, but you dare to reject them? ”</p><p>Ye Qing’s eyes glowed with joy as she coldly said.</p><p>“Since it’s so good, why don’t you get married? since it’s for the good of the sect, then get married!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting stared at Ye Qing and called out.</p><p>“Nonsense. The two seniors of Mount Qinghe have their eyes on you. Alright, this matter is settled. Go back and pack up. In two days, follow me to Mount Qinghe!”</p><p>Ye fa slammed the table and made his decision.</p><p>no, I won’t marry you. I’d rather die than marry you. Unless you kill me and bring my body over.</p><p>Ruan Tingting gritted her teeth, her eyes red as she looked at ye fa with determination.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>“Evil creature!”</p><p>“What an ingrate!”</p><p>The other elders shouted in anger and glared at ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting suddenly burst out laughing. At this moment, her heart was as cold as ice. She was completely disappointed in this sect.</p><p>for generations, the ruan family has given our all for the wind sword sect. We’ve fought bloody battles and made countless contributions. My big brother died in battle for the sect. The ruan family has never owed the sect anything. You don’t have to use any favors to pressure me!</p><p>Ruan Tingting completely exploded. She stood up straight and glanced at ye fa and the elders. Her eyes were filled with disappointment.</p><p>you guys don’t have to give any excuses. Whatever you say is for the sake of the sect’s rise and fall. You’re just doing it for your own selfish reasons. You want to send your descendants, these few pieces of trash, to the hundred venerate mountain. Are they the most talented in the wind sword sect? ”</p><p>Ruan Tingting pointed at Ye Qing and su Luo.</p><p>“B * tch, what did you say? who are you calling trash?”</p><p>Ye Qing screamed.</p><p>“Isn’t it? How many resources has the sect spent on you? If these resources were used on me, I would have broken through to the sea of soul realm long ago. You, on the other hand, have only just broken through to the peak-tier King tier. If you’re not trash, what are you?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shouted.</p><p>“B * tch, b * tch, you’re talking nonsense. I want you dead!”</p><p>Ye Qing’s voice was sharp and her face was twisted. Ruan Tingting had hit her where it hurt.</p><p>if the quota obtained this time is really given to those talented disciples, I can agree to it. But if it’s given to these few trash, I will definitely not agree!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“The matter of the spots, the sect is free to arrange, it’s not up to you to interfere!” Ye FA’s face was very cold as he said in a deep voice.</p><p>Ruan Tingting shook her head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>Her talent was definitely one of the best in the wind sword sect. However, she was usually suppressed in all aspects. All the good resources would be given to Ye Qing, su Luo, and the others first because they had a backer.</p><p>As for her, most of her resources were obtained by completing missions on her own.</p><p>She wouldn’t say anything about this. They were born into different families, and that was how fate was. She could only rely on herself.</p><p>But now, ye fa and the others were so shameless that they wanted to sacrifice her in exchange for Ye Qing and the others ‘opportunities. She would never agree.</p><p>“I’ll say the same thing again. Either you kill me, or I won’t agree to this!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s reply was decisive.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, you’d better think it through. You should know that your parents are still in the sect. You’d better consider their safety!”</p><p>Ye fa said in a deep voice.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s delicate body trembled violently, and her face was deathly pale, without a trace of blood.</p><p>Ye fa actually used her parents to threaten her. Was this something a sect leader should do?</p><p>“Despicable, shameless, ye fa, you guys are despicable!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shouted.</p><p>you bastard! How dare you! Ruan Tingting, come with me to Mount Qinghe in two days. Otherwise, I’ll collect your parents ‘bodies and you’ll still have to go!</p><p>Ye fa stood up and released a powerful aura that pressed down on ruan Tingting.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s body trembled, and a trace of blood appeared at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>She had no choice. Her parents ‘lives were in the hands of the wind sword sect. She could only compromise.</p><p>“Hehe, ruan Tingting, aren’t you pretty? Congratulations, you’ve married two Almighty men!”</p><p>Ye Qing let out a gloating laugh.</p><p>haha, ruan Tingting, when I enter the hundred venerated mountains in the future, I will obtain a great opportunity and become a peerless expert. I will definitely not forget your kindness.</p><p>Sullo laughed heartily, extremely carefree.</p><p>“Trash like you will never achieve anything great!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting glared at them coldly, then turned around and strode out of the meeting hall.</p><p>“Hmph, b * tch, just you wait!”</p><p>Ye Qing snorted.</p><p>Ruan Tingting walked out of the meeting hall in a daze. She felt despair in her heart. The road ahead was long, but she could not see any hope.</p><p>She flew out of the wind sword sect in a daze and disappeared into the distance.</p><p>She only returned to the courtyard in the evening.</p><p>“Eh? Tingting, what’s wrong? Why are your eyes so red? did someone bully you?”</p><p>Kong Jin quickly asked after seeing ruan Tingting.</p><p>I’m fine. Now, all of you, move out of my courtyard and leave the wind sword sect!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said coldly.</p><p>“Ah? You want to drive us away? why?” Kong Jin was a little stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing heard the commotion and walked out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
