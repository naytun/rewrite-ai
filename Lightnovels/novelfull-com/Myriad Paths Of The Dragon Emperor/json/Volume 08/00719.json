It was countless times more precious than any treasure.</p><p>In the future, when Lu Ming cultivated, he would take fewer detours and could improve at the fastest speed.</p><p>This was an Imperial Dao expert. In the divine wilderness continent, he was the strongest expert. He was not like dandan, who bragged about how powerful he was every day. However, he was only half-baked and knew a lot of things. He would only throw it to Lu Ming and let him learn by himself. He had no experience to learn from.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Liao Cang nodded. He took out a scroll and handed it to Lu Ming, this is the spirit weapon I used in the past. It’s called the myriad array diagram. Unfortunately, it was damaged during the battle with Di Yi. Many of the inscriptions and arrays on it have been destroyed, but it’s still very powerful. With your current cultivation, you can’t use it yet. When your cultivation improves in the future, it may be of great use to you. Take it!</p><p>“Myriad array diagram?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He took the myriad array diagram and put it away.</p><p>Lu Ming had never heard of the all formation picture. However, since it was Lian Cang’s treasure, it must be extraordinary.</p><p>At the side, nine suns Supreme was secretly shocked. Lu Ming had never heard of it, but he knew that the myriad array diagram was the treasure that made Liao Cang famous. It was a powerful ninth-level spiritual weapon and an Imperial Treasure. Its power was earth-shaking and could destroy the sky. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Now, Lian Cang gave such an important treasure to Lu Ming. It was clear that he valued Lu Ming very much.</p><p>my dear disciple, your little girlfriend is also extremely talented. Her bloodline and physique have a strong background. Since she has reached the last stage, I must show her some appreciation. Now, let me help you unleash the power of your bloodline to the extreme!</p><p>Lian Cang waved his hand and a ray of light enveloped Xie nianqing.</p><p>A blood-red light flashed behind Xie nianqing, and a lotus flower appeared. On the lotus flower, a beautiful woman sat cross-legged.</p><p>“So it really is this bloodline. Even in that family, this kind of bloodline only appears very rarely. It’s called a variant. Haha, let me see the effect of the Nirvana bloodline!”</p><p>Lian Cang’s fingers moved and a magical array entered Xie nianqing’s blood. Immediately, Xie nianqing’s blood formed a black cocoon. Xie nianqing sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes. He seemed to have started cultivating.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>“Yes.” Liao Cang nodded and said,”I should be able to achieve Nirvana in three days.”</p><p>“Jiuyang, how’s the situation in the talisman Amulet sect?” he asked.</p><p>Nine suns Supreme Master pondered for a moment and said, ” “Ever since the incident with senior Lian, the talisman sect, talisman sect, and puppet sect have been dissatisfied with each other and have been divided into two factions. Their strength has been greatly weakened. Now, a large area of the talisman sect’s territory has been occupied by the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect. They are not as good as they used to be.”</p><p>“I knew that this would be my end the moment something happened to me.”</p><p>Lian Cang sighed.</p><p>I’ve even heard that the puppet lineage might have the intention of joining the Empyrean heaven divine Palace!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Damn it, the talisman sect can not be destroyed like this, disciple!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lian Cang looked at Lu Ming and said, ” the million array illustration is not only a Supreme treasure, it is also a token of the talisman Amulet sect’s sect leader. From now on, the talisman Amulet sect will be handed over to you. After you leave, you have to think of a way to reorganize the talisman Amulet sect and merge the two sects into one. We will regain our former glory.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little confused.</p><p>How could he have the strength to deal with a behemoth like the talisman sect?</p><p>my disciple, since you are my successor and have my token, the talisman Amulet sect is Naturally Yours. Once you have the talisman Amulet sect in your hands, you will have the capital to fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi in the future!</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming. This is also senior Lian Cang’s good intention!”</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“Alright, I promise master that I’ll do my best!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>Indeed, if he could really control the talisman Amulet sect, he would have the capital to fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>“Good, good, haha, I’m relieved. Originally, with my soul power, I could only hold on for a few years before my soul completely dispersed. I didn’t expect that I would finally welcome hope before I die. Haha, the heavens have been kind to me!”</p><p>Lian Cang laughed.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dejected. It was already unbelievable that a wisp of his soul could last for thousands of years. He knew that Lian Cang might not be able to last more than a few years.</p><p>“Jiuyang, there’s still hope for you to be resurrected. If you’re resurrected in the future, you must help Lu Ming!”</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>“Of course, but resurrection is easier said than done!”</p><p>Nine suns Supreme Master sighed.</p><p>there is always hope in everything. Alright, I’ve explained everything. When this girl wakes up, I’ll send you all back to the outside world.</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>“Master, what about the other people from the outer realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“As for the others, let them stay in the underground world. With my current strength, I can’t send so many people out.”</p><p>Lian Cang said calmly.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. Lian Cang was an Imperial path expert. He was high and mighty. In his eyes, ordinary martial artists were probably like ants.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he and Xie nianqing had reached the last stage, which attracted Lian Cang’s attention and made him his disciple, they might have been nothing more than two ants in Lian Cang’s eyes.</p><p>“Master, I want to bring a friend with me, can I?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“A friend? of course. Oh well, I’ll solve this underground human problem by the way!”</p><p>Lian Cang waved his hand and Lu Ming felt the world change. The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in the sky outside the Saint mountain.</p><p>Outside the holy mountain, hundreds of tribes were staring in the direction of the holy mountain.</p><p>Most of the tribes were sighing in sorrow because all of their people had failed.</p><p>Then, they looked at each other to see which tribe had not come out yet.</p><p>Lu Ming and miss Xie have not come out yet. There might be hope!</p><p>Chi Yue, Chi jinkong, and the other members of the red leopard tribe clenched their fists and stared in the direction of the holy mountain with endless anticipation in their eyes.</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s someone in the air!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Countless people looked up and saw a figure appear in the sky. He stood in the air and did not land.</p><p>“What’s going on? How did this person appear in mid-air? the others were directly bounced back by the formation.”</p><p>“This is strange. Which tribe sent this person?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s appearance caused a wave of doubtful discussion.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The people of the red leopard tribe were shocked.</p><p>Did he succeed? Could it be that Lu Ming had also failed?</p><p>At this moment, the entire Saint mountain glowed with bright light, illuminating the land within a thousand miles.</p><p>A figure appeared in the light.</p><p>This figure was 10000 meters tall. He was huge and his body was emitting a Qi that was as powerful as the sky. He was none other than Lian Cang.</p><p>“Ancient ancestor, the ancient ancestor has awakened!”</p><p>“It really is the ancient ancestor!”</p><p>Countless people from the hundreds of tribes let out excited roars and knelt down on the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
