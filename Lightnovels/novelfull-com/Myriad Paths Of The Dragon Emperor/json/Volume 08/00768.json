It was all Lu Ming’s fault for interfering. Otherwise, he would not have to pay such a huge price.</p><p>He was determined to win this competition.</p><p>Other than his daughter, Ye Qing, he had two sons. He had to fight for the spots to enter the hundred zuns mountain for his two sons. Only in this way could his ye family continue to prosper.</p><p>“And …”</p><p>Ye FA’s mouth revealed a smug sneer. Others didn’t know, but he, the ye family’s ancestor, had actually broken through a few days ago, from the third level of the spiritual ocean tier to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, his battle prowess greatly increasing.</p><p>This way, the wind sword sect’s strength would increase greatly.</p><p>This time, not only did the wind sword sect want to be in the top six, but they also wanted to be in the top three, or even the first place.</p><p>Just as he was lost in his thoughts, a figure appeared in the sky, exuding a terrifying pressure.</p><p>The judge arrived.</p><p>Someone would be sent from deep inside ninedragons to host their competition.</p><p>In the depths of ninedragons, there were three dragon veins. They did not belong to any force, but to the Ditian royal guards, who were directly under Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Even the six great ancient families didn’t have the right to mobilize this force. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>This judgment would belong to the Imperial Guards of Ditian.</p><p>Di Tian’s Imperial Guards could also be said to be the core strength of the DI Tian divine guards.</p><p>The leaders of the thirty-six forces stood up and paid their respects.</p><p>yes, I won’t say much. The competition for the hundred venerated mountains will begin now. There are a total of thirty-six forces. The members of your respective forces, please step forward. If anyone dies in the middle of the battle, you can’t continue to change people.</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Immediately, the members of the 36 forces rose and flew to the center of the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group and the other six people from the sea Cloud sect flew up to the fighting ring and stood in a row.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were sizing up the people on the fighting stage, observing the opponents and the experts on the other side.</p><p>this time, many powerful rogue cultivators have been invited. The major forces have really paid a huge price.</p><p>that’s right. Look, the wind sword sect has invited the two monsters of the clear river. Their boss is at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He’s a formidable opponent!</p><p>there’s also the Scarlet Moon sect. The Scarlet Moon sect invited Six-Fingered cultivator, who’s also an expert at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>the most terrifying one is the intentionless mansion. The intentionless mansion has always been known as the strongest force among the 36 forces. They already have two experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. This time, a few unfamiliar faces have appeared in the team. I wonder what their cultivation is? ”</p><p>Many people were looking at the fighting ring and discussing.</p><p>Around the three cities, there were thirty-six forces. They were all small forces. Usually, with an expert at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean realm holding the fort, they were considered a superior force. With an expert at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, they were considered a top force.</p><p>haha, look, the sea Cloud sect actually sent out three young men in their twenties. It seems like the sea Cloud sect really has no one left.</p><p>yeah, haha, but with the sea Cloud sect’s strength, they only care about participating. They probably didn’t think about fighting for a spot!</p><p>“I guess so, just to make up the numbers!”</p><p>Many people laughed when they saw the sea Cloud sect’s formation.</p><p>Apart from the sea Cloud sect, none of the thirty-six forces present were under thirty years old.</p><p>“Haha, Qiao long, if your Sea Cloud sect doesn’t have anyone, you can go yourself. Why send a few juniors to their deaths?”</p><p>The iron bone sect’s sect master, who was a faction beside the sea Cloud sect, laughed and looked at Qiao long.</p><p>The iron bone sect had always had a grudge against the sea Cloud sect. Although they were slightly stronger than the sea Cloud sect, they had also invited a few experts this time. Now that they saw that the sea Cloud sect had even invited a few juniors, they naturally had to seize the opportunity to mock them.</p><p>perhaps brother Qiao just wants to go through the motions and admit defeat as soon as the competition starts. Nothing will happen.</p><p>On the other side, the sect leader of the red moon sect mocked.</p><p>Usually, the sect Masters and family Masters of the major forces would not participate in the battle. After all, they were the Masters of a sect. If they were to go to battle and died in battle, it would have a great impact.</p><p>Hmph, the battle hasn’t started yet. Don’t say it so early, or you’ll be embarrassed later!</p><p>Qiao long said calmly.</p><p>“Haha, Qiao long, if that’s the case, could those juniors be peerless geniuses? Hahaha!”</p><p>The sect leader of the iron bone sect laughed even louder, his laughter filled with mockery.</p><p>Heaven’s pride? There were not many people in the entire East continent who could be called a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>As for the Sea of Souls realm heaven’s favorites, only the top 600 were on the list of top 1000 talents. Even if you included some new talents, there were less than 1000 people.</p><p>Among these 1000 people, the heavenly corpse sect and the talisman Amulet sect made up a portion, and the Emperor heaven divine Palace was only a small portion. How could a small Sea Cloud sect invite a genius?</p><p>Not only did the iron bone sect’s sect master not believe it, but the other forces also did not believe it.</p><p>Hmph, they’re looking down on us. I’ll let Lu Ming and the rest teach them a lesson and give them a big surprise!</p><p>Qiao Xuan and ruan Tingting were sitting together. At this moment, she was pouting and snorting coldly, very unhappy.</p><p>“Yes, you guys go back to your seats!”</p><p>The judge in the sky looked at it and nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest returned to their seats.</p><p>the rules this time are very simple. There are a total of 36 forces. I will call names later. The two forces that are called will fight against each other. The winner will advance and the loser will be eliminated. In the second round, there are only 18 forces left. Similarly, they will fight in pairs to determine the top nine!</p><p>in the end, the top nine will take turns to fight each other. The top six will be ranked according to their battle results, and they will be able to obtain a spot to enter the hundred venerated mountains. Now, let’s begin!</p><p>After the announcement of the referee, he swept his gaze across the court and called out a name.”The Crimson Moon sect against the Zhang family!”</p><p>After the names were called, two forces immediately went up. One was the red moon sect, and the other was the Zhang family.</p><p>the Zhang family is going to lose for sure. The Zhang family isn’t strong to begin with, and the red moon sect already has two patriarchs at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean realm. They even invited six fingers. This time, they have the hope of entering the top six!</p><p>that’s right, but this is more reasonable. Eliminate the weak, and the strong advance!</p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly as they looked at the fighting ring.</p><p>The nine people of the Zhang family had very serious expressions. As soon as they got on the stage, their figures changed and they formed a battle formation.</p><p>hehe, the difference in strength is so great that it can’t be changed by a single battle formation. Attack directly and crush them!</p><p>In the Scarlet Moon sect, there was a green-haired old man with six fingers. He was six fingers loose cultivator.</p><p>He strode forward in a domineering and overbearing manner, crushing the Zhang family’s battle formation in a brutal way.</p><p>The Zhang family’s strongest were only two middle third level spiritual ocean tier martial artists. They were no match for them at all. Not long after, the battle formation was broken, and one of their third level spiritual ocean tier martial artists was killed by Six-Fingered’s trio.</p><p>The others were shocked and quickly admitted defeat.</p><p>There was a rule in the nine-person team battle. As long as five out of nine people admitted defeat, they could admit defeat. More than half of the people had to admit defeat. Otherwise, it was not considered as admitting defeat and the other party could continue to attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
