His combat strength was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the two of them split, they started fighting again.</p><p>“Heavenly Wolf slash, slash all life!”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue was bathed in the bright Starlight. He was like a god who had descended to the mortal world. His aura was magnificent and powerful. He slashed out with his saber, like a wolf howling at the moon.</p><p>If they were fighting at the same level, Shangguan jinjue’s combat strength would even surpass Miao Yi’s.</p><p>Every 100th place on the list of top 1000 talents was a leap and a stage.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue was ranked in the top five hundred, and his combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing Divine Art and the vital essence in his body exploded. Every palm and every punch contained the power to suppress the nine levels of hell. It was extremely terrifying as he engaged in an intense battle with Shangguan jinjue.</p><p>The violent force swept in all directions, causing the surrounding spectators to retreat frantically.</p><p>A powerful Qi blasted towards the mountain peak. However, the long spear that was stuck upside down on the peak of the mountain emitted a red radiance. The powerful Qi that flew away was like a stone sinking into the ocean. It did not cause any movement at all.</p><p>“So powerful! Is this the combat strength of the top 500 on the list of top 1000 talents? It’s too terrifying.”</p><p>that’s right. The 100th place on the list of top 1000 talents is a threshold!</p><p>“Who is that person? He can actually fight against Shangguan jinjue!”</p><p>Cries of alarm came from the surroundings.</p><p>The most important thing was that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the second level of the spiritual ocean realm. For a second level spiritual ocean realm to be so powerful was simply terrifying.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Is this the combat strength of the top 500 on the list of top 1000 talents? It’s indeed powerful, but that’s all.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he suddenly waved his palm.</p><p>Four types of lights flashed. Lu Ming’s palm contained four concepts.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had only used three types of intent realm, the earth intent realm, and not an explosion.</p><p>He also wanted to test the strength of the top 500 on the list of top 1000 talents. Now that he had found out, it was time to end the battle.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The palm struck down and Shangguan jinjue’s saber-light was shattered. Shangguan jinjue’s face was filled with fear as he frantically retreated while holding his saber in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck Shangguan jinjue’s saber. It was as if an ancient divine mountain had crashed into Shangguan jinjue. Shangguan jinjue’s body trembled violently. He spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“How is that possible? You were holding back just now?”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue roared in disbelief. Lu Ming was only at the second level of the spiritual ocean realm. When he fought with him just now, he actually held back his strength. It was simply unbearable for someone as proud as him.</p><p>“I don’t need to use my full strength to deal with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and struck with his palm.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue let out a long howl. Starlight filled the air and the howl of a Wolf shook the sky. He wanted to fight back, but Lu Ming’s four wills were too strong. Even though Shangguan jinjue’s will of stars had already reached the second level advance, it was still vulnerable under Lu Ming’s will.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shangguan jinjue’s body was sent flying. There was a big hole in his chest, and his bones were shattered. He spat out a large mouthful of blood, and his eyes were full of fear.</p><p>“Stop, you win this battle. We’ll fight again another day!”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue shouted and quickly retreated, trying to leave.</p><p>“What a joke, who wants to fight you another day? You can come and go as you please, what do you take me for? Since you’ve come today, don’t leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and moved forward at top speed, his eyes cold.</p><p>you want to kill me, but you have to understand that if you kill me, you’ll have to wait for the Shangguan family’s crazy revenge!</p><p>Shangguan jinjue said coldly. He had actually threatened her.</p><p>“That’s my business, you don’t have to worry about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was calm and he was unmoved.</p><p>Today, he was determined to kill Shangguan jinjue.</p><p>The disciples of the major aristocratic families were all the same. Today, under the watchful eyes of the public, Lu Ming had killed three young men from the Shangguan family and defeated the Shangguan golden Jue. Even if he let the Shangguan golden Jue go, he would still seek revenge. He might as well kill him to end the matter.</p><p>Seeing this, Shangguan jinjue was truly afraid. He understood that he had met a ruthless person.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue fled into the distance.</p><p>However, how fast was Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven stomping steps? After a few steps, he caught up to Shangguan jinjue. His palm was like a divine monument, and he continued to press down.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue bellowed in anger and tried to fight back with all his might. The next moment, one of his arms was crushed.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was aimed at Shangguan jinjue’s head.</p><p>Miao Yi, along with a few other young men, rushed towards Lu Ming’s group at top speed.</p><p>“We’re almost there. This time, I’m going to make that kid face a life-and-death dilemma!”</p><p>In Miao Yi’s eyes, a crazed killing intent kept flashing.</p><p>“Eh? There’s a huge battle ahead!”</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a rumbling sound coming from the front.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!” Miao Yi brought a few young men and increased their speed, flying forward.</p><p>He did not fly far before he saw Shangguan jinjue running away in fear. A man was chasing after him.</p><p>“That’s Shangguan jinjue, and that kid!”</p><p>Miao Yi’s pupils rapidly contracted.</p><p>The next moment, he saw Shangguan jinjue scream in pain. Lu Ming’s palm struck him without any hesitation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Shangguan jinjue’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>Miao Yi’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and he almost bit his tongue.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue had been killed by Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed Shangguan jinjue with a single palm strike, he extended his hand and took Shangguan jinjue’s storage ring. He then devoured the blood essence and looked at Miao Yi with a cold gaze.</p><p>“You’ve also brought people to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s tone was cold and filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Miao Yi’s heart trembled, and he felt cold sweat breaking out on his back. He hurriedly said,”No, no, why would I? I just happened to pass by, just happened to pass by, haha, brother is really brave, this younger brother admires you. Goodbye, goodbye now!”</p><p>Miao Yi cupped his fists, an ugly smile on his face as he turned around and left.</p><p>What a joke. Shangguan jinjue’s combat strength was much stronger than his. He was also the Shangguan family’s peerless pride of heaven. His status was also extraordinary. Lu Ming had even killed Shangguan jinjue. He would most likely not show mercy to him. He was simply a ruthless man. He was not afraid of the forces behind them at all.</p><p>He no longer had the thought of killing Lu Ming. He only wanted to get as far away from Lu Ming as possible.</p><p>Miao Yi left as if he was trying to escape. A smile hung on the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth. He did not pursue him.</p><p>As expected, if you were ruthless, others would be afraid of you.</p><p>The other young powerhouses in the surroundings were also extremely shocked, and their feelings were extremely complicated.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue, the famous heaven’s favorite in the eastern barren land, had died just like that.</p><p>Now, the battle of Providence had yet to begin, and there were already peerless geniuses dying one after another. When the battle of Providence officially began, how tragic would it be? how many geniuses would die then?</p><p>At that time, the strong would become stronger and step over the corpses of the weak to reach the peak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed as he kept the storage rings of the other members of the Shangguan family and devoured all the blood essence. He then flew to the mountain peak where the spear was stuck upside down. He sat cross-legged and began to refine the blood essence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
