It was actually located on top of this dragon vein, but it was completely isolated from the outside world by a peerless formation. There was only one entrance that could be entered.</p><p>...</p><p>although the hundred venerated mountain is called the hundred venerated mountains, there are actually more than a hundred venerable ones who left their imprints and inheritances. I estimate that there are at least a few hundred of them scattered in every corner!</p><p>Qiao Xuan explained.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, it seems like we have to cultivate separately. Let’s see who improves faster after a while!</p><p>Kong Jin laughed.</p><p>Each of them was good at different things, and the intent they comprehended was also different. Of course, they couldn’t cultivate together. In the hundred venerated mountain, they needed to find the most suitable one for themselves in order to improve their comprehension.</p><p>Similarly, it also required luck.</p><p>“Good! We’ll meet here after a while!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Immediately after, the eight of them split up, each choosing a direction and flying forward.</p><p>The hundred venerated mountain was huge, with a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles. There were countless peaks, and no one knew which peak or which corner would have a venerable leaving a mark.</p><p>Moreover, the spiritual Qi in the hundred venerated mountains was unimaginably dense. It was several times denser than the Dragon vein outside.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the density of the spiritual energy here was almost the same as that of low-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>What did this mean? it was equivalent to the lower spiritual crystals filling the world.</p><p>In just one breath, he had absorbed the total amount of spiritual Qi contained in several lower spiritual crystals.</p><p>“I don’t even need spiritual crystals to cultivate here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He was really envious of those people from the great aristocratic families.</p><p>However, now was not the time to cultivate. The most important thing was to find a mark that was suitable for him and comprehend intent.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way. Soon, he found more than ten people sitting cross-legged on the lakeside.</p><p>Lu Ming landed and noticed that there was a strong aura in the lake.</p><p>He sensed carefully and suddenly felt that there was a huge flood Dragon in the lake that was pouncing at him. This flood Dragon contained a powerful water concept.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still and let the flood Dragon Rush past him.</p><p>what a marvelous water mentality. It contains the spiritual God Realm master’s understanding of the water mentality. It can be combined with one’s own body and be used as a reference for enlightenment. Unfortunately, I have not cultivated the water mentality. I’d better find another place!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He rose into the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>Following that, he found a few imprints left by spirit God experts, but none of them were suitable for him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming noticed a cliff in front of him. There was a deep mark on the cliff that seemed to have been left behind by a sword.</p><p>This cliff was thousands of meters high. In front of the cliff, there were more than a dozen stone pillars that stood on the ground, level with the cliff.</p><p>On the stone pillars, there were many figures sitting cross-legged.</p><p>There were a total of 18 stone pillars, and 17 of them were already occupied. Only one stone pillar was empty, and this stone pillar was the closest to the cliff.</p><p>Lu Ming flew up and landed on the stone pillar.</p><p>“Wind concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and realized that the carvings on the cliff contained a mysterious wind concept, which was exactly what Lu Ming needed.</p><p>When Lu Ming landed, the people on the other stone pillars opened their eyes one after another. When they saw Lu Ming, their expressions changed slightly.</p><p>“Brother, I advise you to leave that stone pillar!”</p><p>A young lady said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Why?” Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>“Because that stone pillar has already been reserved by someone. That person has said that no one else is allowed to set foot on this stone pillar!”</p><p>The woman explained.</p><p>“Oh? Where’s that person?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>that person is not in the baizun mountain now. Perhaps he is cultivating somewhere else!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled,’since I’m not here, why can’t I use it? Furthermore, the hundred venerated mountains is a public area, and I have never heard of it belonging to a single person. Even if he is not here, I can still use it!”</p><p>Lu Ming then sat down cross-legged.</p><p>“Hehe, brat, I might as well tell you. That man’s name is Miao Yi, the youngest son of the Miao family!”</p><p>A sneer came from the other stone pillar.</p><p>“Miao Yi? Miao Yi, 501st on the list of top 1000 talents?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed as he said.</p><p>that’s right, hehe. So, I advise you to leave. When he comes and sees you up there, you won’t have a good end!</p><p>The young man sneered.</p><p>“Then we’ll wait for him to come!”</p><p>leave, ” Lu Ming said calmly. He had no intention of leaving.</p><p>“Hmph, you overestimate yourself. When Miao Yi comes, you’ll be in for a good time!”</p><p>The young man snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care about his surroundings. His gaze was fixed on the carved line on the cliff.</p><p>Slowly, the mark changed in Lu Ming’s eyes. It turned into a sword and then into a human figure, dancing in the air. Each sword contained a mysterious concept of wind.</p><p>Even if it was the same intent, different people would have different comprehensions.</p><p>How profound was the comprehension of intent of a spiritual God Realm powerhouse? Lu Ming could compare it with his own concept and seek inspiration to quickly improve his understanding of the concept.</p><p>When intent reached level two, it wasn’t something that could be continuously broken through just by using intent crystals. If one used only intent crystals, it was extremely easy to reach a bottleneck, and one would still need to comprehend it.</p><p>As long as he could combine the intent crystals with his own comprehension, that would be the best way.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. Lu Ming had many new insights into the concept of wind.</p><p>He continued to cultivate. Days passed and another four days passed. Lu Ming had been here for seven days.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was in the midst of comprehending when he suddenly felt a sharp killing intent enveloping him.</p><p>His eyes moved and looked to the side.</p><p>A young man in a green robe was walking toward them step by step.</p><p>“It’s Miao Yi, Miao Yi has come!”</p><p>“That kid is in trouble!”</p><p>Seeing the person, the surrounding people all let out a low cry.</p><p>In particular, the young man who had said that Lu Ming was overestimating himself was gloating.</p><p>“Now, you’re going to cry!” The young man sneered.</p><p>Miao Yi was dressed in a green robe, his hands behind his back, his gaze cold as he stepped through the air and appeared not far from the stone pillar.</p><p>“Kid, who allowed you to sit on that stone pillar? didn’t anyone tell you that I ordered that stone pillar?”</p><p>Miao Yi looked down at Lu Ming from above. His voice was cold and gloomy, like a venomous bug that was staring at his enemy. It sent chills down one’s spine.</p><p>“I heard about it. When I first came, someone told me that.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Since someone told you, you still dare to sit on it. Do you not put me in your eyes? Now, roll down from above, give yourself a hundred slaps, and then get as far away as you can. I won’t hold it against you!”</p><p>Miao Yi ordered, as if he was ordering a servant.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled. This Miao Yi was really overbearing.</p><p>However, when had he, Lu Ming, ever been afraid of others being overbearing?</p><p>“Let me ask you, does the hundred venerated mountains belong to your Miao family?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Miao Yi said.</p><p>“Since you’re not, what’s wrong with you cultivating here? Don’t you know that it’s a first come, first served basis? If you want it, just wait at the side.”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
