There were three auras, which were called stele Qi.</p><p>...</p><p>As long as one killed or defeated another, one would be able to snatch the Qi from the other party. When all three Qi were taken away, one would be transported out.</p><p>And the final ranking was also determined by the amount of stele Qi.</p><p>In the world of the Heavenly King stele, there were only three days. In other words, one had to obtain as much stele Qi as possible within three days. After three days, the person with the most stele Qi would be ranked first on the Heavenly King ranking. The top 108 people would be the final 108 names.</p><p>Therefore, these three days were destined to be brutal. There would be endless battles.</p><p>Finding a place to hide wouldn’t help him obtain the final spot.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and the others weren’t nearby. It was obvious that they had been randomly scattered when they entered.</p><p>it’s said that the Dao of inscription can’t be used in the world of the Heavenly King tablet. Let’s try it!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and started to inscribe runes on the ground.</p><p>The inscriptions flew into the ground, but the next moment, they disappeared.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming tried to inscribe runes on himself again and realized that the result was the same. He could not stop it and it collapsed directly.</p><p>“As expected, in this place, one can only rely on one’s martial cultivation and not the Dao of inscription!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>“Aiyo, let me out for some fresh air!”</p><p>He did not know when dandan had climbed onto Lu Ming’s shoulder again. Previously, Lu Ming had stuffed her into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“Dandan, you should return to the Supreme shrine. This place is extremely mysterious. I’m afraid there are some important people observing. Don’t blame me if I catch you and braise you.”</p><p>Lu Ming reluctantly stuffed dan dan back into the Supreme shrine.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming randomly chose a direction and soared into the sky, flying into the distance.</p><p>“Hand over your monument Qi!”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming met an elder. He did not expect the elder to turn and run when he saw Lu Ming. Lu Ming chased after him hurriedly.</p><p>How fast was Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven-treading steps? He caught up in a few moments and punched out, causing the old man to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“I’ll give you all my stele Qi, don’t kill me!”</p><p>The old man cried out in fear. He secretly sighed in his heart that he was unlucky. He did not expect to meet Lu Ming, this monster, the moment he entered.</p><p>The old man stopped resisting. He knew that Lu Ming wanted to kill him and he could not resist at all.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and shattered the Heavenly King stele’s shadow above the elder’s head with a single palm strike. The three streams of stele Qi above the elder’s head all flew into Lu Ming’s Heavenly King stele’s shadow.</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light enveloped the old man. The next moment, the old man’s figure disappeared and reappeared outside.</p><p>After Lu Ming obtained the three traces of stele Qi, he continued to fly in search of his next prey.</p><p>There were only three days left, so he had to make full use of the time.</p><p>In the next three hours, Lu Ming met seven people in a row.</p><p>One of them resisted with all his might and was killed by Lu Ming. The other six surrendered and obediently offered their stele auras.</p><p>Lu Ming’s stele Qi had become twenty-seven.</p><p>Outside, everyone was staring at the Heavenly King tablet. The images on the tablet kept changing.</p><p>“It seems that the strongest group of people this time must be the young ones.”</p><p>no matter how long the older generation has cultivated, their talent is still limited. It’s hard for them to compete with the peerless geniuses.</p><p>that’s right. This time, there are even more geniuses. Not only the top ten, but I’m afraid the top twenty will all be taken by the young heaven’s pride experts. As we’ve seen just now, Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, the corpse King, and the others are almost invincible. They’ve swept all the way.</p><p>hey, look, that’s Lu Ming. In front of him are the two old geezers from the heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>At this moment, the screen suddenly flashed and Lu Ming’s figure appeared.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was flying forward. On a mountain peak not far ahead of him, two elders were hidden. They exuded a cold and gloomy aura.</p><p>the two old fogeys from the heavenly corpse sect are extremely powerful. They’re the most promising candidates for the top one hundred and eight this time. This is interesting. Lu Ming is about to be ambushed!</p><p>Many people widened their eyes and looked at the scene on the divine King’s tablet.</p><p>Dongfang Hao didn’t change the screen either. He seemed to be interested.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally did not know that there were two experts waiting for him in front. He flew forward at top speed.</p><p>All of a sudden, two black shadows flashed at high speed. Two sharp glints were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. The Spear’s gleam condensed and swept toward the two black shadows.</p><p>There was a loud boom and Lu Ming’s figure swayed slightly. The two figures also retreated.</p><p>“Refined corpse!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that it was two refined corpses that had ambushed him.</p><p>The two refined corpses were tall and strong. They were wearing black battle armor and holding two black battle swords. Their eyes were flashing with blood-red light.</p><p>hehe, it’s that kid called Lu Ming. He’s the genius who has reached the 20th step of the Heavenly King monument!</p><p>A faint sneer was heard as two black-robed figures appeared beside the two refined corpses.</p><p>They were two old men who were so thin that they were only skin and bones. They looked like two skeletons and were extremely gloomy.</p><p>The only difference was that one of them had a thick corpse Qi, while the other had a ghost Qi.</p><p>hehe, such a genius has endless potential. We must kill him now. Otherwise, he will be another disaster for our heavenly corpse sect in the future!</p><p>The old man with ghostly Qi sneered.</p><p>“Just you two old ghosts?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Brat, your combat strength is not bad. I’m afraid that any one of us is no match for you, but do you think you still stand a chance if we join forces?”</p><p>The old man with corpse Qi grinned. The next moment, a huge bush appeared under his feet. The coffins opened, and more than a dozen refined corpses flew out. Each refined corpse was wearing black armor and holding a black sword. Their aura was extremely powerful.</p><p>Although these refined corpses were only peak-tier Kings, they were all extremely powerful, much stronger than ordinary peak-tier Kings. This could be seen from the two refined corpses that had just ambushed them.</p><p>However, this old man could control so many refined corpses of peak-tier Kings. This was terrifying.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>The old man with the corpse Qi bellowed, and the dozen refined corpses roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the old man with the ghostly aura moved. He threw a punch, and the world was filled with ghostly wails and ghastly howls. A black fist radiance was sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Strong. These two old men were very strong. They were the kind of old monsters who had cultivated for hundreds of years.</p><p>“I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>With a sweep of his spear, the three refined corpses were sent flying. At the same time, he threw a punch with his left hand to offset the fist radiance of the old man with ghostly Qi. Then, he strode toward the old man with corpse Qi.</p><p>“You want to kill me? die!”</p><p>The old man with corpse Qi smiled coldly and controlled the rest of the refined corpses to surround Lu Ming.</p><p>“I can’t be bothered to waste my time with you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming put away his infinite Dragon Spear and cast the explosive star fist. In an instant, he had thrown hundreds of punches.</p><p>Each fist ray was infused with the intent realms of wind, fire, and Thunder.</p><p>Especially the wind and lightning intents, they had reached level two and their power was terrifying.</p><p>Hundreds of fist forces drowned the refined corpses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
