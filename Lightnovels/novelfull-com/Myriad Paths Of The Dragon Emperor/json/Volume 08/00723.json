If he didn’t run, he would die.</p><p>However, one of them suddenly turned into a cloud of blood mist with a bang in the process of running.</p><p>As for the other one, it suddenly split into two while it was running.</p><p>The four peak-tier Kings were all dead!</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>A powerful aura rose from Lu Ming’s body and enveloped the blood Fiend.</p><p>Yun Sha’s pupils contracted sharply. The strength displayed by Jian feiliu and Xie nianqing had shocked him.</p><p>“You think you can kill me? No matter how strong a peak King tier is, he’s still a peak King tier. I’ll let you all know how strong a spiritual ocean tier warrior is.”</p><p>Bloody ghost’s body emitted a thick blood-colored mist. His eyes turned red, and so did his hands.</p><p>“Blood hand! Die!”</p><p>Yun Sha stepped forward and struck a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The smell of blood filled the air, and it was filled with the smell of corrosion. Even the air was emitting terrifying crackling sounds.</p><p>“Middle first level of the spiritual ocean tier, perfect to test out the power of the prison suppressing heavenly technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. His war Dragon true energy howled violently as he struck out with his palm like a heavenly blade.</p><p>It was as if a divine monument had been condensed in this palm, suppressing everything.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and blood Fiend’s palm collided with each other, producing a dull sound.</p><p>In the next moment, everyone saw a figure retreating madly, blood spurting out of his mouth. This person was Xue Sha.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Sha’s palm had already become mush. His eyes were filled with disbelief and fear.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>you … Yun Sha roared in shock. He felt as if an ancient divine mountain had crashed into him with Lu Ming’s palm just now. His internal organs were all injured and his body felt like it was about to crack.</p><p>“Spiritual ocean tier? I’ve already seen it, so let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and his body was like a stream of light. He appeared in front of Blood Fiend in an instant and struck him with his palm again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, bloody ghost was forced back thousands of meters. His arms exploded and turned into ashes. Not only that, a big hole was blown in his chest, and his whole body was distorted.</p><p>If it wasn’t for his profound cultivation and powerful body, he would have died.</p><p>spare me! he shouted in horror. don’t kill me!</p><p>What welcomed him was a spear light. The dazzling spear light pierced through the void and pierced through bloody ghost’s heart.</p><p>Bloody ghost, dead!</p><p>Everyone present was stunned.</p><p>Three moves … In just three moves, he had killed a sea of soul realm expert. Was he still a peak-tier King? It was truly terrifying.</p><p>Luo Xin, Luo Ming, and the rest were also shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength had improved and become stronger compared to when he was on golden sand island.</p><p>we’re both peak-tier King tiers, but I’m far too inferior!</p><p>Chen Dao shook his head with a bitter smile.</p><p>the prison suppressing heavenly art is indeed a demigod level bloodline martial technique. It’s really powerful, but the amount of true Yuan it consumes is also shocking!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and devoured Blood Fiend’s storage ring and blood essence.</p><p>“I’ll leave these people to you. Xiao Qing, brother Jian, let’s go!”</p><p>The first sentence was directed at the flame Chamber of Commerce, and the second sentence was directed at Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu.</p><p>The strongest few had been killed, and the rest of the blood Fiend Pirates were left to the flame Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>After all, the flame Chamber of Commerce still had four peak-tier Kings. They would definitely take this opportunity to annihilate the blood Fiend Pirates.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two soared into the sky. As expected, they heard deafening battle cries behind them.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Luo Xin muttered as she looked into the distance. She then sighed and joined the battle.</p><p>The three of them sat cross-legged on the giant snake puppet and continued on their journey.</p><p>brother Lu, you’re getting stronger and stronger. I don’t think I’m your match anymore.</p><p>Jian feiliu said with a bitter smile.</p><p>“Brother Jian is too humble!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“I’m not being humble, I’m just telling the truth!”</p><p>Jian feiliu then looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Although Xie nianqing didn’t reveal much, he gave him a feeling of unfathomability. He estimated that if they really fought, he wouldn’t be a match.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that Xie nianqing and Lu Ming’s will of heaven and earth were still at level one. If their will of heaven and earth broke through to level two, how terrifying would that be?</p><p>if the two of them break through to the second level of the essence realm of heaven and earth, they will be able to compete with those freaks on the Heavenly King ranking!</p><p>Jian feiliu was moved.</p><p>Although he was ranked 788th on the list of top 1000 talents, there were many peak-tier Kings who were more powerful than him.</p><p>That was because the list of top 1000 talents only listed those below 30 years old, while the list of Heavenly Kings had no age limit.</p><p>The top 600 on the list of top 1000 talents were almost all at the spiritual ocean tier and above. Only the last ten Heavenly Kings had been able to rank in the top 600 with their King’s realm cultivation. It was a terrifying feat.</p><p>Therefore, there were nearly 200 heaven’s favorites on the list of top 1000 talents who were stronger than him. There were also many powerful older King tiers. Therefore, there were many peak-tier King tiers who were stronger than him.</p><p>After all, the eastern barren territory was too big, and there were too many peak-tier Kings.</p><p>I need to quickly upgrade my earth will to the completion of level one. Otherwise, I won’t be able to exert much power.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>There was still a huge difference between the earth concept and the other three concepts. Once the earth concept was similar to the other three concepts, the power of the fusion of the four concepts would be terrifying. Lu Ming’s combat strength would also increase by a notch.</p><p>The giant snake puppet was very fast. After another three days, they arrived at the golden light region, which was twice as fast as they had expected.</p><p>After reaching the golden light region, they continued to fly. After another three days, they arrived at the golden sword sect.</p><p>The golden sword sect was too majestic. It was more magnificent and powerful than any sect Lu Ming had ever seen.</p><p>The golden sword sect was the number one sect in the golden light region. Although it was a subsidiary sect of the Emperor heaven divine Palace, the golden sword sect’s authority in the golden light region was as great as the Emperor heaven divine Palace’s. From this, one could see its strength.</p><p>Furthermore, the golden sword sect also had an inter-province transportation array that could transport one to other large regions.</p><p>They were going to take the gold sword sect’s inter-domain teleportation array to head to the Heavenly King domain.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s status in the golden sword sect was very high. He was the number one genius of the golden sword sect. After returning, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were naturally treated with great hospitality.</p><p>brother Lu, miss Xie, you might have to stay in the golden sword sect for two days. This time, the golden sword sect will be sending out a group of peak-tier Kings to compete for the Heavenly King ranking!</p><p>Jian feiliu brought Lu Ming and Xie nianqing to an elegant courtyard and told them.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>“Could it be that this time, all the peak-tier Kings in the eastern barren territory will be gathered?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>gathering all the peak-tier Kings is naturally a little exaggerated. However, most of the peak-tier Kings with profound strength should be participating. Of course, this refers to humans. The demon race of the sky demon Valley will not participate. The talisman sect will also not participate!</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Why is the talisman Amulet sect not participating?” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was somewhat curious.</p><p>that’s because the Heavenly King ranking only focuses on martial arts. The Dao of inscription will not benefit you.</p><p>Jian feiliu explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and had a rough idea of what was going on.</p><p>It seemed like this Heavenly King ranking competition would be extremely intense.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
