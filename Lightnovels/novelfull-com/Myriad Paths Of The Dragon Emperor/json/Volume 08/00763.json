The dagger danced in the air, shooting out rays of cold light that were extremely sharp.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>One of the burly men was swept by the sharp light, and one of his arms was cut off. He retreated while screaming in pain.</p><p>“Sixth-level spiritual weapon, how do you have a sixth-level spiritual weapon? damn it, take them down. This sixth-level spiritual weapon is mine!”</p><p>Ye Qing shrieked, her eyes revealing a greedy light.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s spirit weapon was naturally from the storage rings of those sea of soul realm martial artists that she had previously obtained.</p><p>Ruan Tingting was controlling a sixth-level spiritual weapon, and her combat power had already suppressed the other peak-tier Kings. She was about to rush out.</p><p>However, at this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds came from behind them. At least a few dozen figures were flying over at extreme speed.</p><p>Two of them had auras as deep as the ocean, and they were all at the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Ye fa, the Grandmaster of the wind sword sect, and su Luo’s father, su tengshan.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s family revealed a look of despair.</p><p>not only did your family betray the sect, but you also injured your fellow disciples. This is a heinous crime. Take them all down!</p><p>Ye fa ordered.</p><p>More than a dozen figures flew out from behind ye fa, and more than half of them were peak-tier Kings.</p><p>“Tingting, run! I’ll hold them back!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father roared and rushed toward the dozen or so figures.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shouted.</p><p>“Go, go quickly, Tingting, you can’t marry the two monsters of Qinghe River, go quickly!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father roared, and the aura on his body became violent.</p><p>“Not good, he’s going to self-destruct!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this time, su tengshan took a big step forward and pressed down with his palm. A palm print as big as a mountain hit ruan Tingting’s father.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father coughed out a large mouthful of blood, and his body made a cracking sound.</p><p>“Father, don’t!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father ignored his injuries and rushed over madly.</p><p>“Ruan Zhen, since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Su tengshan took a step forward and pointed out his finger. The terrifying finger force was like a sharp sword, shooting toward ruan Tingting’s father.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The finger force pierced through ruan Zhen’s chest and pierced through his heart.</p><p>“Hurry, let’s go!”</p><p>Ruan Zhen spat out his last words before his life was extinguished and he fell to the ground.</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes were bloodshot as she screamed madly.</p><p>“Brother Zhen!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s mother also shouted and ran toward ruan Zhen’s body.</p><p>“Even without your parents, you still want to go to Mount Qinghe. I will kill your parents now and seal your cultivation. Two days later, I will send you to Mount Qinghe!”</p><p>Su tengshan strode forward and pointed out his finger again.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Just as ruan Tingting’s mother caught ruan Zhen’s body, she was pierced through by the finger force and fell to the ground. She turned around to look at ruan Tingting for the last time before her life force dissipated.</p><p>“Father, mother, ah! I want you all dead!”</p><p>su tengshan! ruan Tingting screamed crazily. Her eyes were filled with killing intent. She rushed towards su tengshan crazily. The Qi on her body was extremely violent.</p><p>“How is it possible for you to self-destruct in front of me?”</p><p>Su tengshan coldly snorted and struck out a palm. Ruan Tingting’s entire body trembled and she coughed up a large amount of blood. Her body flew far away. Her cultivation had been sealed by su tengshan’s true essence.</p><p>A burly man flew forward and caught ruan Tingting.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, ye fa looked on coldly.</p><p>kill me. You’d better kill me. Otherwise, I swear I’ll kill you. I’ll destroy the wind sword sect and avenge my parents!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes were filled with hatred.</p><p>“You? hehe, if you can last three months against the two monsters of Qinghe, I’ll admit defeat!”</p><p>Ye Qing coldly laughed.</p><p>ruan Tingting, you brought all of this upon yourself. If you had obediently agreed, how could all of this have happened? all of this was caused by you.</p><p>Sullo sneered as well.</p><p>“Alright, take her away and lock her up!”</p><p>Ye fa waved his hand.</p><p>“Whoever dares to touch Tingting, I will kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, a deafening roar reverberated in the air. A terrifying killing intent permeated the air from outside the wind sword sect. It was as if an unparalleled beast had awakened.</p><p>Four figures instantly appeared in this place.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, and Qiao Xuan had finally arrived.</p><p>“Let go of your dirty hands!”</p><p>Kong Jin’s body exuded a terrifying aura. The huge axe in his hand was covered in blood. A wind sword sect disciple had tried to stop him earlier, but he had been chopped off by his axe.</p><p>At this moment, the ferocity on his body was extremely thick. His figure moved and appeared in front of the burly man who had grabbed ruan Tingting.</p><p>The burly man was shocked and was about to retreat, but a large hand reached out and grabbed his neck.</p><p>With a crack, the peak-tier King’s neck was snapped.</p><p>Kong Jin took advantage of the situation and pulled ruan Tingting into his arms.</p><p>“Tingting, are you okay?”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at ruan Tingting worriedly.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Tears streamed down ruan Tingting’s face as she looked at her parents ‘corpses in a daze.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was like a mountain. He strode forward, and the world rumbled. He did not hide his cold killing intent at all.</p><p>a bunch of trash. Today, all of you will die!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p>it’s you little B * stards! How dare you trespass into the wind sword sect? tell me, did you collude with that b * tch ruan Tingting to plot against the wind sword sect?!</p><p>Su Luo pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and clenched his fist in the air.</p><p>Su Luo suddenly felt that he was bound by a force and his body was flying toward Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>“Ah, father, save me!”</p><p>Sullo was scared and shouted in fear.</p><p>“Brat, let go of my son!”</p><p>Su tengshan strode forward and wanted to help.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch with his other hand. A ray of fist radiance flew out and hit su tengshan, sending him flying backward.</p><p>The next moment, su Luo fell into Lu Ming’s hands. He had his throat in Lu Ming’s grasp.</p><p>“Speak, who killed the two of them?”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the corpses of ruan Tingting’s parents and asked su Luo.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you grab me? put me down! You’re looking for death, do you know that?”</p><p>Sullo shouted.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A blast of energy shot out and cut off sullo’s arm.</p><p>Sullo let out a hysterical scream.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>ah, I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you! My father killed him! It’s my father! It’s not my fault!</p><p>Su Luo screamed and betrayed su tengshan.</p><p>Su tengshan’s face turned pale as he roared, ” kid, let go of my son. Otherwise, I guarantee that you won’t be able to walk out of the wind sword sect!</p><p>At this moment, two more powerful auras descended. They were two extremely powerful elders from the wind sword sect.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’d like to see how you’re going to prevent me from leaving the wind sword sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and his palm burst with energy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Su Luo exploded in Lu Ming’s hands and turned into a cloud of blood mist.</p><p>“Luo ‘er, ah, damn it, I want you to pay with your life!”</p><p>Su tengshan roared with red eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
