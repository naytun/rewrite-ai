Xie nianqing couldn’t refuse. If she refused, she was afraid that the other party would force her.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at 10000 snakes Valley.</p><p>The group of nine people walked in.</p><p>In the beginning, they were indeed hunting poisonous snakes to make some medicine.</p><p>Soon, they were about thirty miles away.</p><p>you guys stay here and hunt for poisonous snakes. I’ll take miss Xie nianqing to the front to take a look!</p><p>Yin que ordered.</p><p>“Alright, young master, you can go!” Elder kui laughed, but there was a hint of gloominess in his smile.</p><p>“Miss Xie, let’s continue forward!”</p><p>Yin que said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned. She had a bad feeling in her heart, but she had no choice but to agree. She made up her mind that if the other party had any ill intentions towards her, she would rather die than let them have their way.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and followed Yin que inside.</p><p>Soon, the two of them traveled another five to six miles.</p><p>Red flowers bloomed all over the place. These flowers were very strange. They were in the shape of snakes, just like small snakes. They also gave off an intoxicating fragrance that smelled very good.</p><p>Along the way, Yin que didn’t do anything out of the ordinary. Xie nianqing also gradually relaxed and slowly strolled around.</p><p>But slowly, Xie nianqing felt that something was wrong. She felt her body becoming weaker and weaker.</p><p>She was very smart. She suddenly thought of something. Her face turned pale. She ran forward a few steps and said, ” Yin que, what did you do to me? ” You’re using poison on me?”</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Yin que saw that Xie nianqing’s body was indeed weak, and he laughed evilly, ” I didn’t poison you. However, this place is full of snadesire flower. The pollen of this flower is like poison to those who can’t use their vital essence and spiritual fire. Anyone who smells it will feel weak all over. Hahaha!</p><p>Yin que laughed.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Xie nianqing kept retreating, feeling weaker and weaker.</p><p>“Hehe, what are you doing? Bitch, I don’t care what your status is outside the earth, but you’d better behave yourself here. I want to marry you as a concubine because I think highly of you, but you’ve refused me time and time again, and you even dared to scold me. Now, I’ll let you know the consequences of rejecting me!”</p><p>In Yin que’s eyes, the fire was dancing. His eyes wandered all over Xie nianqing’s body, and the fire in his eyes became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted. Her spine suddenly glowed with a red light. Then, her body darted forward and ran into the depths of 10000 snakes Valley.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yin que shouted angrily. He didn’t expect that Xie nianqing could still use such a strange power even though his vital essence and spirit Fire were sealed. He was careless and Xie nianqing ran hundreds of meters away.</p><p>He immediately chased after her at top speed.</p><p>In the end, Xie nianqing’s true essence and mental energy fire were sealed. Her body was special, so she could borrow some of the power of her bloodline. However, it was not much. Before she could run a mile, the power of her bloodline dissipated. She felt her body becoming weaker and weaker. She staggered and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>Yin que caught up from behind.</p><p>“Hehe, let’s see where you can run to. I’ll serve you well later.”</p><p>After running for a while, Xie nianqing’s body was covered in sweat. His sweat soaked his clothes, causing them to stick tightly to his body. His curves were even more shocking.</p><p>Yin que’s evil fire exploded as he looked on. His entire body was hot and he couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes revealed a trace of despair. He touched his waist and a short dagger appeared in his hand. He pressed it against his chest and looked at Yin que with determination, ” “If you want to use force, I’ll die!”</p><p>Yin que’s footsteps stopped and his face was dark. He said coldly, ” “I don’t believe that you don’t even want your life!”</p><p>Then, he strode forward.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you fool, where are you? Perhaps, you and I will never meet again.”</p><p>Xie nianqing closed his eyes and stabbed the dagger into his heart.</p><p>……</p><p>In the depths of the 10000 snakes Valley, Lu Ming took out a Jade bottle and kept a cloud of blood mist. He then frowned.</p><p>He didn’t know why, but he had been feeling uneasy since just now. He felt inexplicably irritable.</p><p>This was somewhat unbelievable. At Lu Ming’s current realm, his martial arts heart was stable. Most things would not make him feel agitated.</p><p>But just now, he felt inexplicably irritable and uneasy, but he didn’t know the reason.</p><p>“Kid, what’s wrong? Something’s wrong with my condition!”</p><p>Dandan could tell Lu Ming’s state.</p><p>I don’t know why, but I’ve been inexplicably irritable since just now. I keep having this uneasy feeling!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Inexplicable restlessness? “The deeper a martial artist’s cultivation base is, the more they’ll be connected to the laws of the universe and their minds will be clear. Therefore, any emotion that appears won’t be without reason. Something is definitely going to happen.”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. In ancient times, there were powerful people who could even predict some fragments of the future. It was mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Dandan closed her eyes and waved her pair of front claws, producing inscriptions.</p><p>After a while, dandan suddenly opened her eyes and said anxiously, ” “Not good, brat, your little lover is in danger!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned but he immediately realized that dandan was talking about Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s wrong with her? Where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked anxiously.</p><p>“It’s just a few miles away, hurry up or it’ll be too late!” Dandan shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, Lu Ming exploded. His figure was like a bolt of lightning as he charged out of the snake Dowager.</p><p>Chi Yue’s eyes flickered and inscriptions appeared on her body, forming a pair of wings. With a flap, she turned into a Phantom and followed.</p><p>The distance of several miles was covered in a few breaths ‘time under Lu Ming’s full outburst.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived, he saw Xie nianqing’s dagger stabbing into his heart. Blood was flowing out and it was a ghastly sight.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, it was as if Thunder had exploded in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>He could roughly guess what was going on with just one look at this scene.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and pounced on Xie nianqing like a bolt of lightning. He used his essential core to wrap around Xie nianqing’s arm, stopping her dagger from continuing.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still a little too slow. Xie nianqing’s dagger had already pierced through his muscles. A part of it had already pierced into his heart. Fortunately, it was not deep.</p><p>Lu Ming wrapped his arms around Xie nianqing’s waist. His essential core surged into Xie nianqing’s body and protected his heart.</p><p>“Silly girl, you’re here. I thought I’d never see you again!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and looked at Lu Ming in a daze. He did not even blink, afraid that all of this was a dream.</p><p>“Don’t say anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as his vital essence continued to flow into Xie nianqing’s body. His Combat Dragon vital essence was very active and successfully sealed Xie nianqing’s heart meridian. At the same time, Xie nianqing’s wound was slowly healing.</p><p>He rejoiced that he had arrived in time. If he had been a little later, perhaps it would have been an eternal farewell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
