The others almost jumped up in shock.</p><p>He had hidden his strength. Lu Ming had definitely hidden his strength before this. His true combat strength was so powerful that he could defeat the boss of the Qing He twin monsters with one move. One must know that the boss of the Qing He twin monsters was stronger than Six-Fingered cultivator.</p><p>Many people realized that they had underestimated the sea Cloud sect’s strength. To be more precise, they had underestimated the strength of those young people.</p><p>He didn’t show it just now because he didn’t need it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field had already enveloped the wind sword sect disciples. The terrifying pressure suddenly pressed down, causing the wind sword sect disciples to move as slowly as a turtle.</p><p>“Haha, kill!”</p><p>Kong Jin laughed out loud and struck out with his battle axe. The wind sword sect Grandmaster’s body trembled violently and he staggered back with a pale face.</p><p>“Let’s enter together!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw out two punches. One of them was aimed at the eldest brother of the Qing He duo, while the other pierced through the void and aimed at the second brother.</p><p>The second brother of the Twin monsters of Qing He was only at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier. He was sent flying by a punch and coughed up large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>An even more terrifying fist radiance followed closely, drowning the second brother of the Qinghe twin monsters.</p><p>The second brother of the Qing He twin monsters let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was blasted apart by Lu Ming’s fist force and he died on the spot.</p><p>“Second brother!”</p><p>The leader of the Qing He twin monsters roared angrily. His eyes were red. He unleashed all his strength and bombarded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Little bastard, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>The sword aura in the hands of the leader of the Qing He twin monsters was like a river, surging toward Lu Ming. The sharp aura filled the air and cut the space, leaving traces.</p><p>“It’s your turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he struck out with his palm. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and his palm was like a divine monument.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The river of sword Qi collapsed and the prison suppressing heavenly art suppressed everything. The two monsters of Qing He cried out in pain and retreated, blood spurting out of their mouths.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>He howled madly and looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of disbelief and fear.</p><p>His cultivation had already reached the middle fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and his combat strength was not weak either. Yet, he was not Lu Ming’s match and was completely crushed by Lu Ming. Lu Ming was only at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, how could there be such a freak?</p><p>His heart trembled.</p><p>The next moment, he heard a scream. On the other side, the wind sword sect master was in an even worse state. One of his arms had been cut off, and he was covered in blood.</p><p>The strength that Kong Jin displayed was even stronger than when he fought six fingers.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings was shocked beyond words.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength was shocking. He completely crushed the boss of the Qing He twin monsters.</p><p>Even Kong Jin’s strength was stronger than before.</p><p>They had been hiding their strength. They had not even used their full strength before.</p><p>In the red moon sect’s area, Six-Fingered cultivator’s face was a bit pale. He originally thought that Kong Jin’s battle power was stronger than his, but not by much. However, he now understood that Kong Jin had been pretending.</p><p>In the intentionless mansion, many experts of the intentionless mansion had grave expressions.</p><p>“Fatty, send them on their way!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He strode forward and struck with his palm. A terrifying pressure suddenly exploded as if it was going to crush the boss of the two monsters of Qinghe River.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The boss of the Qing He twin monsters tried his best to resist, but one of his arms was shattered.</p><p>On the other side, the wind sword sect’s Grandmaster was in an even worse state. A deep gash appeared on his chest, and he was almost split in half.</p><p>we admit defeat! We admit defeat!</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The boss of the Qinghe twin monsters and the patriarch of the wind sword sect roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Kong Jin continued to charge forward.</p><p>why aren’t you guys stopping? we’ve already admitted defeat!</p><p>The wind sword sect’s patriarch roared.</p><p>“What a joke, there are only eight of you left, and it will only take effect if more than half of you admit defeat. Only two of you admit defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“You guys, quickly admit defeat!”</p><p>The leader of the Qinghe twin monsters felt the killing intent from Lu Ming and was on the verge of tears. He roared madly at The Other Wind sword sect members.</p><p>However, The Other Wind sword sect members were simply in a dilemma.</p><p>They were enveloped by Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field. The most important thing was that it contained a terrifying destructive cutting power. They felt that they would be killed in the next moment.</p><p>As long as they opened their mouths and shouted a word, the terrifying destructive cutting power would enter their mouths, making it difficult for them to speak.</p><p>Their hearts were burning with anxiety, but they couldn’t utter a word.</p><p>“It seems like they don’t want to admit defeat!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped forward. A terrifying pressure was exerted on the two monsters of Qing He.</p><p>cheating, they’re cheating! Judge, we admit defeat, we admit defeat!</p><p>On the grandstand, ye fa stood up and shouted madly.</p><p>“You’re a person who didn’t participate in the battle. What’s the use of admitting defeat?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a sidelong glance at him and said coldly.</p><p>they’re about to admit defeat. You guys controlled them. You guys cheated!</p><p>Ye fa shouted, his heart burning with anxiety.</p><p>according to the rules, you have to admit defeat personally to be considered to have admitted defeat!</p><p>In the sky, the judge coldly said.</p><p>He found Lu Ming and the others interesting. He muttered to himself that the judge could not be bothered with the lives of a few ants from the wind sword sect. He was only doing things according to the rules.</p><p>The judge’s words made ye FA’s face turn pale.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>On the battle stage, Kong Jin’s roar was like thunder as his battle axe chopped down. The wind sword sect’s Grandmaster screamed in pain as he was split into two.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm hit the two monsters ‘chests. The terrifying power destroyed their boss’s heart and internal organs.</p><p>The Qing He twin monsters roared, their eyes filled with unwillingness.</p><p>This time, they were not here to die, but ye fa had paid a heavy price to invite them.</p><p>If they had known that they would die if they came, they would never have come. However, there was no medicine for regret in this world.</p><p>The boss of the two monsters let out an unwilling roar and died.</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and kept old monster Qinghe’s storage ring. He devoured the blood essence.</p><p>Then, with a flash of his body, he devoured the blood essence of the wind sword sect Grandmaster and the second brother of the Qinghe twin monsters.</p><p>At this moment, the remaining people who were enveloped by Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field were so scared that their faces turned pale, their bodies trembled, and they broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>The Qinghe twins and the wind sword sect’s Grandmaster had been killed. Would they be killed next?</p><p>Yet, they could not admit defeat.</p><p>All he saw was that their faces were pale and their eyes were full of pleading.</p><p>little Qing, kill those at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier. Leave the rest to Tingting!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. With a press of her hand, the destructive cutting power suddenly increased by several times.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Two wind sword sect experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier were killed by the destructive cutting force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
