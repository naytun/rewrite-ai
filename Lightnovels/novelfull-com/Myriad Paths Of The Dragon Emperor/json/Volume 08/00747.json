They’ll meet Jiang Taixu and the others soon.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and Luan Zhan add up to almost 80 experts. Lu Ming and the others can’t possibly be a match for them. Wouldn’t they be courting death if they charged forward like this? ”</p><p>“Maybe they have a way? This battle will definitely be exciting!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they stared at the image on the divine King’s tablet. There were also many people discussing it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, everyone suddenly felt two auras as deep as the ocean above their heads. An enormous pressure pressed down on them like the ancient divine mountains.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock.</p><p>In the sky, two young figures had appeared.</p><p>One of them was dressed in a purple robe and looked like a noble young master. However, his body was emitting an extremely hot aura, like a sun floating there.</p><p>The other person was wearing a black robe and had his hands behind his back. He was like a peerless divine weapon that could destroy the sky.</p><p>“That’s Wang Yan! Wang Yan from the Wang clan!”</p><p>“And Jiang Taichong!”</p><p>why are Jiang Taichong and Wang Yan, who are ranked in the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents, here? aren’t they cultivating in seclusion in a secret place to prepare for the battle of Providence? ”</p><p>that’s right. They shouldn’t have any interest in the Heavenly King ranking!</p><p>Everyone was discussing in shock.</p><p>Jiang Taixu is getting more and more useless. I thought he could win the first place after three years of silence.</p><p>Jiang Taichong put his hands behind his back and smiled faintly.</p><p>the new guys who rose up this year are quite interesting!</p><p>Wang Yan smiled faintly.</p><p>it’s interesting, but it’s a pity that his cultivation is too weak. It’s not worth mentioning!</p><p>Jiang Taixu looked at the scene on the Heavenly King’s tablet as if he was watching a good show.</p><p>If they didn’t happen to pass by this time, they wouldn’t have bothered to watch the Heavenly King ranking battle. Their goal was the battle of karmic luck.</p><p>The others suppressed the shock in their hearts and continued to look at the screen.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and the group were getting closer and closer to the exit. Finally, both parties met.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming and the rest, Jiang Taixu and the rest emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally here. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu said coldly.</p><p>“Wait for me? Why? You’re not convinced after losing the last time? You want to fight me again? Alright, I’ll take you on anytime!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Jiang Taixu gritted his teeth, his face gloomy. Lu Ming was rubbing it in.</p><p>Moreover, he knew very well that he was not Lu Ming’s match. Why would he fight him?</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t think that I’m afraid of you. However, this is not a fighting ring. I have a better way to defeat you. Why do we need to fight?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu said.</p><p>if you’re scared, then say you’re scared. If you don’t dare, then say you don’t dare. And you’re still acting so high and mighty. What other methods are there? you’re just relying on more to win. Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“The winner is king, and the loser is Bandit. Don’t you understand this principle? Let’s attack together!”</p><p>At this point, Jiang Taixu could no longer care about his pride. He only had one thought in his mind, and that was to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was the one who caused him to lose face.</p><p>If Lu Ming was not that powerful, if Lu Ming had obediently allowed him to kill him from the beginning, why would he do this? It was all Lu Ming’s fault.</p><p>The Jiang family, the Wang family, and the Luan family charged at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The aura of nearly eighty experts converged, and it was terrifying.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and the four of them retreated quickly.</p><p>After that, the four of them split up and retreated in four directions.</p><p>“If you have the guts, don’t run!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>“Let’s fight one-on-one if you have the guts!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Wang Jue, chaotic battle, let’s kill one of them each!</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted. He led more than thirty Jiang family experts and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Wang Jue, on the other hand, charged towards Xie nianqing and Luan Zhan, leading his men towards Kong Jin.</p><p>As for Jian feiliu, they did not care about him at all. As long as they killed Lu Ming and the other two, killing Jian feiliu would be a piece of cake.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure was like a demon, forming a series of phantoms. His speed was extremely fast, and he kept changing his position in the air.</p><p>As for Kong Jin, he was like a fierce beast, running wildly in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and turned into a stream of light, appearing in front of the Wang family members in an instant.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure flashed, leaving behind afterimages. Then, he pressed his hands together and the sky demon force field burst out, enveloping some of the Wang family members.</p><p>“Exploding star fist!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and threw hundreds of punches in succession. Hundreds of fist gleams drowned seven to eight Wang family experts.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered as he unleashed a destructive slash.</p><p>There, screams could be heard.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>Wang Jue charged towards Xie nianqing like a madman.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming threw hundreds of punches, he appeared beside Xie nianqing in a flash. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and turned into a stream of light, leaving the place.</p><p>As for the seven or eight Wang family Masters who were surrounded by Xie nianqing, they were already dead.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing appeared behind the Jiang family.</p><p>Xie nianqing reached out his hand, and the sky demon force field covered seven or eight of the Jiang family Masters.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he launched hundreds of fist radiance.</p><p>They didn’t pick on Jiang Taixu. There were a few other extremely powerful existences, but they picked on those who were slightly weaker.</p><p>These seven or eight people were also successfully killed.</p><p>“Dammit, dammit! Kill!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu changed his direction and charged at Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming hugged Xie nianqing and their figures flickered. They appeared in another direction and attacked together, killing another five to six Jiang family experts.</p><p>The speed of Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was too fast. It was a divine level martial arts technique and no one of the same level could compare to it.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming, don’t run if you have the guts. Stop and fight head-on!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>“Alright, let’s have a one-on-one!” Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>Jiang Taixu stopped talking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed continuously. More than ten experts from the Jiang family and the Wang family were killed.</p><p>Streams of stele Qi flew towards Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. Both of them had more than 3000 strands of stele Qi.</p><p>Tragic, too tragic.</p><p>Jiang Taixu had brought more than 30 experts with him, but now there were only about ten left, and all of them looked pale.</p><p>Wang Jue was even worse off. He only had five or six people left with him.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I want you to die!”</p><p>Wang Jue roared.</p><p>gather, let’s gather together. Don’t split up!</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>The three parties quickly gathered together.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and Luan Zhan each led a few of their strongest experts and guarded three sides to prevent Lu Ming from ambushing them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had also spread out and surrounded Jiang Taixu and the rest.</p><p>This scene was extremely comical.</p><p>The four of them surrounded dozens of people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
