The red leopard tribe has been sealed here for sixty years. Even with the help of many divine level alchemists, we still can’t break the seal. He’s just a young boy, a heaven level Alchemist. How can he break the seal here? it’s impossible. You guys should leave quickly. Otherwise, I’ll take it as him trespassing the forbidden area and suppress him!</p><p>...</p><p>sixth uncle, Lu Ming has not even tried. How do you know that he won’t be able to do it? given the current situation of our tribe, shouldn’t we seize every opportunity? ”</p><p>Red Moon argued.</p><p>“Impudent, what does a junior know? Hurry up and leave!”</p><p>Chiding the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>“I think this seal can be broken!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s voice was heard and the scene fell silent. Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Really?” Chi Yue’s eyes revealed a look of ecstasy.</p><p>“Of course!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“You’re talking big, kid. What are you up to? You want to destroy my red leopard tribe’s forbidden ground? I suspect that you are using some kind of evil technique to control Red Moon. You are simply up to no good. Men, kill this brat for me!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s expression was extremely gloomy, and his killing intent exploded as he shouted.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The people guarding the entrance of the valley all waved their hands, and several cheetah puppets appeared on the ground. They were all spiritual ocean tier puppets.</p><p>The puppet roared and was about to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who dares?”</p><p>Chi Yue shouted and stood in front of Lu Ming. At the same time, she summoned her cheetah puppet.</p><p>“Miss Chi Yue has already been controlled by this evil person, she can’t help herself. Quickly attack, kill that brat and save miss!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain roared.</p><p>“Kill, kill that brat!”</p><p>Chi Feng also roared, his killing intent exploding.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. With a wave of his hand, the giant wolf puppet appeared and blocked in front of him. He stomped on the ground and waved his hands. Runes appeared on the ground.</p><p>A great battle was about to start.</p><p>“Stop! What are you doing?”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar sounded, and a white-haired elder flew over on a cheetah puppet.</p><p>“Second uncle!”</p><p>Chi Yue was overjoyed.</p><p>what’s going on: ” the white-haired elder arrived and scanned the scene. His face was dark. what’s going on? ”</p><p>second brother, that brat has controlled Yue ‘er and has ulterior motives. I’m about to kill him!</p><p>Pure gold Mountain hurriedly said.</p><p>“Nonsense! Second uncle, Lu Ming is an inscription master from beyond the ground. He can break the seal of the canyon. That’s why I brought him here. I didn’t expect sixth uncle to want to kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>Chi Yue argued.</p><p>“What? He can break the seal of the valley?”</p><p>The white-haired elder was shocked, and his eyes shone brightly. A layer of blue mental energy fire spread out from the top of his head due to his excitement, and his vast mental energy filled the entire area.</p><p>Yue ‘er, don’t be fooled by this man. He’s just a heaven grade Alchemist and he’s so young. How many inscriptions can he master? how can he break this seal? he’s simply talking nonsense!</p><p>Pure gold Mountain said coldly.</p><p>“Second uncle, why don’t you let Lu Ming try? what if it works? This is related to the rise and fall of our clan, so please consider it, second uncle!”</p><p>Chi Yue shouted.</p><p>Chi Yue’s second uncle was called Chi Jintian. He looked at Lu Ming with a hint of hope in his eyes.”Little brother, can you really break the seal here?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and said, ” I’ve observed it just now. There are three different inscriptions in it. The inscriptions are intertwined and there should be more than a hundred inscriptions. Although it’s mysterious, it has been sixty years. It’s not difficult to break it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s words caused Chi Yue and Chi Jintian’s eyes to light up, while Chi Jintian’s face grew even gloomier.</p><p>“This matter is of great importance. I need to inform the clan leader and the elders!”</p><p>Chi Jintian took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a few messages. Then, he started to wait.</p><p>The pure gold Mountain knew that he couldn’t stop them, so he walked to the side with a gloomy face.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the pure gold Mountain, his eyes flickering.</p><p>This pure gold Mountain was very strange. It wanted to stop him from breaking the seal no matter what. Just like what Red Moon had said, this was related to the rise and fall of the red leopard tribe. Even if there was a one in ten thousand chance, they still had to try. However, pure gold Mountain kept stopping him.</p><p>If it was because of the Scarlet mountain matter, it was impossible. Just now, when they didn’t mention breaking the seal, the Scarlet mountain was still normal, as if it had intentionally broken the seal.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming felt very strange about all this.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In just a few minutes, seven or eight huge cheetah puppets flew over in the howling wind.</p><p>There was a total of eight cheetah puppets, and on each of them stood a person. One of them looked to be in his fifties, and his body exuded a dignified aura. Lu Ming guessed that this might be Chi Yue’s father, the chief of the red leopard tribe, Chi jinkong.</p><p>As for the other seven, they were all white-haired old men and old ou. They should be the tribal elders of the red leopard tribe.</p><p>“Greetings to the clan leader and the clan elders!”</p><p>The pure gold sky, pure gold Mountain, and the guards all saluted.</p><p>“Father, elders!”</p><p>Chi Yue also stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>Chi jinkong’s eyes were like lightning. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Yue ‘er, is he the one you said could break the seal?”</p><p>Although Chi jinkong was pretending to be calm, he still revealed a trace of excitement.</p><p>that’s right, father. Lu Ming came from the outer-world and is the most powerful genius Alchemist there. Although he’s at the peak of the heaven rank, his mental strength is not weaker than that of a divine rank.</p><p>Chi Yue stepped forward and held Chi jinkong’s arm as she smiled.</p><p>“The most talented inscription master from beyond the earth?”</p><p>The eyes of Chi jinkong and the seven elders lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and smiled bitterly. This girl was too good at boasting for him.</p><p>haha, Yue ‘er, I think you’ve been deceived by him. It’s been said since ancient times that the world beyond the ground is vast and boundless. It’s many times larger than this place and has a countless population. It’s like sand. How can he be the most talented inscription master? Tribe leader, elders, you must not trust this person. If you make a mistake and cause the formation to explode, destroying the body of the previous tribe leader and the inscription secret manual, then our red leopard tribe will be finished!”</p><p>Pure gold Mountain jumped out to stop him.</p><p>“Sixth uncle … You … You haven’t seen Lu Ming in action. How do you know that his Dao of inscription is not strong?”</p><p>Chi Yue said stubbornly.</p><p>since that’s the case, why don’t you let him show it off? if he wants his spiritual power to be on par with a divine-rank inscriber at the heaven rank, he must light at least seven or even eight spiritual lamps at every stage. Let him show his spiritual ring!</p><p>The pure gold Mountain sneered.</p><p>The divine-level Alchemist he was referring to was, of course, a true-level Alchemist. At every stage, he had to light up at least six spirit lamps. This was already very difficult. He did not believe that Lu Ming could really light seven or even eight spirit lamps at every stage.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, just show it to someone!”</p><p>Chi Yue looked at Lu Ming. She was very confident in Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
