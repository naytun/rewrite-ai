The other eight are paths of death. Once you step in, you will die without a doubt. You can choose one to enter!”</p><p>...</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Nine paths, eight paths of death, and one path of survival. If he were to choose, the chances of survival were only one in nine.</p><p>Was this a test of luck?</p><p>“Senior, may I ask if there are any hints?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No hints, you can choose!” A voice rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed even more tightly.</p><p>“Could it really be a test of luck? that’s impossible. Luck is something that’s illusory and no one can say for sure. Since the person who set up these formations wanted to take the test, there’s no way it was a test of luck. It’s better to just test my luck.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly.</p><p>you have five minutes to consider. If you don’t choose, you can just retreat!</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>why five minutes? I can make my decision now!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode toward the middle path.</p><p>Nine paths appeared in front of Xie nianqing, exactly the same as Lu Ming’s. Xie nianqing pondered for a moment before he strode into the fourth path.</p><p>Jian feiliu looked at the nine paths in front of him and frowned. After a while, he sighed and turned around.</p><p>After a short while, he appeared at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Faced with a one-ninth chance of survival, how many people could make a choice?</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the middle path. The next moment, he found himself in a huge cave.</p><p>The cave was very wide, and in the middle of the cave, there was an altar.</p><p>At this time, in the cave, there was a flash of light and another figure appeared.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming and walked over with a smile.</p><p>“As expected, the nine paths were a lie!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>it’s not really a lie. You need to test a person’s courage and wisdom!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the previous nine paths were not eight dead ends or one path of survival. Instead, all of them were paths of survival.</p><p>As for the eight dead ends, it was purely a scare.</p><p>This would depend on everyone’s judgment. Of course, it would also require great courage.</p><p>For some people, even if they could guess the answer, it was a different matter whether they dared to step in.</p><p>What if there was really a dead end? This place required courage.</p><p>There was no doubt that Xie nianqing and Lu Ming had successfully passed the test.</p><p>After a moment, no one else appeared. Only Lu Ming and Xie nianqing appeared.</p><p>“Sigh, after so many years, someone has finally come here!”</p><p>At this moment, a sigh was heard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions changed.</p><p>“Didn’t you all come here to find me?”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a figure appear on the altar in the middle.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man in his forties. He wore a long, two-colored robe and was floating in the air. A terrifying pressure emanated from his body.</p><p>The middle-aged man did not release any aura, but the pressure he exuded was natural. Lu Ming had a feeling that he was facing a vast heaven and earth, a whole world.</p><p>“Strong, too strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>However, this middle-aged man was obviously not a real person. He was an illusionary body that seemed to be transparent.</p><p>strong, he’s too strong. He’s an Emperor, an expert of the Emperor path.</p><p>Dandan screamed in horror, her four limbs and head all retracted into the turtle shell.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s hearts trembled.</p><p>Wasn’t an Imperial path expert a Martial Emperor?</p><p>The person in front of him was actually a Martial Emperor? Was the Martial Emperor’s treasure real?</p><p>“Interesting little turtle.”</p><p>The middle-aged man glanced at dandan, then at Lu Ming and then at Xie nianqing. It was as if the sun, moon, and stars were shifting in his eyes.</p><p>“These two little fellows are interesting. They seem to be hiding a lot of things.”</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and waved his hand.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming seemed to have lost control of himself. Five spiritual rings floated above his head.</p><p>five stages and ten mind lamps have been lit. Amazing, amazing. Back then, I was only at this level. Haha, good!</p><p>The middle-aged man laughed.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask who you are? Did senior set up the entrance to the Martial Emperor’s treasure in the chaotic Astral Ocean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The person in front of him should be the ancient ancestor that the people of the underground world had mentioned.</p><p>“Who am I? Sigh, it’s already been thousands of years, I’ve almost forgotten about it. ”</p><p>The middle-aged man let out a faint sigh. After a moment of silence, he said, ” “My name is Lian Cang!”</p><p>“Lian Cang?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked puzzled. He had never heard of this name.</p><p>“Lian Cang, you are the talisman Emperor, the sect master of the talisman sect, Lian Cang!” Xie nianqing exclaimed.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>“What? He’s the talisman Emperor?” Lu Ming was also shocked and shocked.</p><p>He had never heard of the name Lian Cang, but not many people had not heard of the talisman Emperor.</p><p>There were four Overlord forces in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>The Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, the heavenly demon Valley, and the talisman sect.</p><p>The talisman Amulet sect focused on inscription and focused on the Dao of inscription. Martial arts were only supplementary.</p><p>The talisman Emperor was the sect master of the talisman sect. He had reached level nine in the Dao of inscription, which was equivalent to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>He was as famous as Di Yi and Martial Emperor. He was one of the few emperors in the eastern barren land. He could shake the entire Eastern barren land with a stomp of his foot.</p><p>In fact, in the entire divine wilderness continent, they were the strongest.</p><p>It was said that the talisman Emperor had fallen 3000 years ago. As for why he had fallen, it had always been a mystery.</p><p>But why did he appear underground?</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had endless questions in their hearts.</p><p>“Little girl, you know quite a lot. Your bloodline is very special, so you should be from that family in the central continent, right?”</p><p>Lian Cang revealed a smile.</p><p>Xie nianqing was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Central continent, Xie nianqing came from the central continent? then why did she come to the East continent?</p><p>“You guys must be very curious about what happened, right? Why am I here?”</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>actually, I was ambushed and killed by someone. The person who ambushed me was the palace Master of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, Martial Emperor Di Yi!</p><p>Lian Cang said word by word.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled again.</p><p>The talisman Emperor, Lian Cang, was killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi’s sneak attack? It was beyond their expectations.</p><p>3000 years ago, I was secretly killed by Di Yi, and only a wisp of my soul was left. I escaped into this underground world and escaped the detection of Di Yi’s Martial Emperor. I’ve been alive until now! The talisman Emperor slowly explained the reason.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
