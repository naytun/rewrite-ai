You don’t have to be so polite. Unfortunately, we were one step too late! Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>If they had been a step earlier, ruan Tingting’s parents might not have died.</p><p>“Tingting, where do you plan to go next?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan pulled on ruan Ting Ting’s hand and asked with concern.</p><p>I don’t know either. I need to find a place to cultivate. I must raze the wind sword sect to the ground!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said through gritted teeth.</p><p>how about this? the hundred venerated mountains is an opportunity. We will assist a force to obtain a place to enter the hundred venerated mountains to cultivate. This way, your cultivation speed will definitely increase!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said to ruan Tingting.</p><p>“That’s a good idea!”</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>“How about this? you guys come with me to the sea Cloud sect, and I’ll report this to my father. My father’s been looking for outside help all this time, and it’s impossible for my Cloud Sea sect to obtain a spot. If you guys join and obtain a spot, then it’ll all be yours. How about it?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>that’s possible, but we don’t want all the spots. Four will be enough!</p><p>Kong Jin quickly nodded.</p><p>After that, everyone left the place and flew toward the sea Cloud sect. On the way, they discussed the details.</p><p>After they arrived at the sea Cloud sect, Qiao Xuan arranged a place for Lu Ming and the others to stay, then she went to report to her father.</p><p>More than an hour later, Qiao Xuan returned and said that her father wanted to meet Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Many people in the sea Cloud sect knew ruan Tingting, so there was no need for her to go. Xie nianqing was not interested in her, so only Lu Ming and Kong Jin followed Qiao Xuan to the sea Cloud sect’s meeting hall.</p><p>In the conference hall of the sea Cloud sect, Qiao Xuan’s father, Qiao long, was not the only one sitting there. There were also five or six elders of the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>“Sect head, do you really believe that Xuan ‘er is acquainted with some powerful being? That girl Xuan ‘er’s friends, do you think we don’t know? They’re all young people around his age.”</p><p>A middle-aged man said to Qiao long.</p><p>“That’s right, although my Sea Cloud sect is weak, we can’t just randomly invite people to fill the numbers!”</p><p>Another elder said.</p><p>this time, Xuan ‘er is very serious. She said that she knows a few strong practitioners who can easily kill an expert at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier and are unfathomable. That’s why I called you guys along to meet them!</p><p>Qiao long said.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect could only be considered a lower-tier power among the dozen or so forces around the Grand gathering city. The strongest in the sect was only at the peak second level of the spiritual ocean tier. It was almost impossible for them to get a spot in the hundred venerated mountains this time.</p><p>However, they were unwilling to give up. After all, this spot was extremely precious to small forces like them. They wanted to fight for it.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been constantly seeking outside help, and had practically run all over the area around Grand gathering city. There were even some powerful itinerant cultivators near other cities who wanted to ask them for help, but they were all rejected.</p><p>If he had to choose those experts, he would naturally choose the powerful forces.</p><p>During this period of time, he had spent a huge sum of money and a huge price, but he had only managed to invite an expert at the early stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier to help.</p><p>The moment he heard Qiao Xuan say that she knew a few strong practitioners who could easily kill the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, he was naturally a little moved and wanted to meet them.</p><p>To be able to easily kill someone at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, his battle prowess definitely wouldn’t be weaker than the late stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, or even the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>If they could help the sea Cloud sect in battle, they would be a great force.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>An elder said.</p><p>Then, Qiao Xuan brought Lu Ming and Kong Jin into the room.</p><p>The people in the hall were immediately stunned.</p><p>They didn’t expect that the people Qiao Xuan had brought would be two young men, and they looked like they were in their early twenties.</p><p>“Xuan ‘er, are they the few powerful beings you mentioned?”</p><p>A middle-aged man was the first to speak.</p><p>“Elder Hua, that’s right, they are Xuan ‘er’s friends!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>nonsense! Xuan. er, this battle is no small matter. All the major powers will send out their strongest forces and it will be extremely dangerous. You … Your friends are too young. If something happens to them, how are you going to explain it to their elders?”</p><p>Qiao long berated.</p><p>“Father, Lu Ming, Kong Jin and the others are very strong. They can easily kill martial artists at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>Qiao Long’s gaze flickered. He seemed to feel that the name Lu Ming sounded familiar, but he could not recall it at the moment.</p><p>“He can easily kill a martial artist at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier? Xuan ‘er, you’re really getting out of hand. Do you know how strong the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier is? How can he be killed so easily?”</p><p>Elder Hua shook his head and laughed.</p><p>The wind sword sect’s matter had already been sealed off from the entire sect. They would naturally not spread such an embarrassing matter everywhere. As such, Qiao long and the others did not know what had happened in the wind sword sect.</p><p>The other elders also shook their heads and laughed. They felt that Qiao Xuan was still young and didn’t understand many things. It was normal to hear rumors.</p><p>They did not think that Lu Ming and the rest could easily kill a martial artist at the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>So young and with such battle power, he was most likely a heaven’s favorite. How could Qiao Xuan know him?</p><p>“Xuan ‘er, take your friends with you. If they want to play in the sea Cloud sect, that’s fine too. Take them around.”</p><p>Qiao long said with a smile.</p><p>“Sect leader Qiao, how do you know that Qiao Xuan is lying if you haven’t tried? If we miss it, wouldn’t we be missing out on a great opportunity?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming smiled and cupped his fists.</p><p>that’s right, sect master Qiao. It’s not that I’m bragging, but not to mention the peak of the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, even the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier would be split in half with this axe of mine!</p><p>Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>young man, you’re quite arrogant. Let me test you!</p><p>Elder Hua stood up, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Early stage of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>This elder Hua was one of the top experts in the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Elder Hua took a few steps forward and threw a punch at Kong Jin.</p><p>This punch moved the air, and it was like a mountain crashing toward Kong Jin.</p><p>Kong Jin’s mouth twitched slightly as he casually threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the two fists collided, elder Hua’s expression changed and he was forced to retreat a dozen steps.</p><p>Qiao long and the other elders were greatly alarmed and stood up from their seats one after another.</p><p>Kong Jin had actually forced elder Hua back with a casual punch.</p><p>hey, uncle, use your full strength. This is boring!</p><p>Kong Jin casually said.</p><p>“Alright, watch my fist!”</p><p>Elder Hua’s expression was serious. He took a deep breath and his body emitted a blue light. His intent combined with his true essence and he threw a punch at Kong Jin.</p><p>This punch was several times stronger than before.</p><p>However, Kong Jin still casually threw out a punch. In the end, elder Hua was still forced to retreat. This time, he retreated even further, more than 20 steps.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
