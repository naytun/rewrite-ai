Then, they stepped on the 11th step.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop and also stepped onto the 11th step.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>When he reached the eleventh step, beams of light shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These lights were of various colors and shapes. There were swords, sabers, fists, palms, hammers, and so on.</p><p>These weapons of various colors exuded a cold killing intent as they flew towards Lu Ming. It was as if many experts were attacking him.</p><p>Lu Ming stood still.</p><p>Pfft! “Pfft!”</p><p>These weapons struck Lu Ming’s body one after another. The difference was that previously, the demonic beasts disappeared as soon as they pounced on him. However, this time, the weapons pierced through his body after hitting him. Holes appeared on his body, and the pain that seeped deep into his soul spread out.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and looked in other directions. He saw that the others were not injured, but their eyes were filled with disbelief or solemness.</p><p>An illusion. It should still be an illusion, but this illusion was too real.</p><p>It was just like many experts who were really attacking him and piercing his body. That kind of attack could even penetrate deep into his soul, causing him extreme pain.</p><p>In such an environment, how many people would be able to hold on to their hearts, remain unmoved, and even move forward bravely?</p><p>Once they retreated, these illusions could become real and cause serious injuries.</p><p>it’s powerful, but it’s far from enough to defeat me. My heart is as firm as a rock. If I retreat in the face of such an attack, how can I face Martial Emperor Di Yi in the future? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he continued to walk forward.</p><p>On the 12th step, there were still many attacks. Each color represented a kind of heaven and earth intent realm. It was extremely profound and was definitely left behind by a top expert.</p><p>Then, the 13th step, the 14th step.</p><p>At this point, the twenty-nine experts from the metal sword sect had all stopped.</p><p>On the 14th step, only Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, Wang mie, Wang Mang, and the three gray-robed young men from the heavenly corpse sect were still struggling. In addition, there were two white-haired elders.</p><p>Below the stairs, countless people were watching.</p><p>amazing. They’re indeed peerless geniuses. Who do you think is stronger? which step do you think they’ll reach? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. The Heavenly King monument tests a person’s will, will, and heart of martial arts. It has little to do with battle strength, so it’s usually hard to tell.</p><p>even so, it’s not completely untraceable. Generally, the more talented and the more potential one has, the further one can go. For example, Jiang Taixu. So I think Wang mie will go further in this group. He should have no problem reaching the 17th step!</p><p>yes, that’s true. Also, that Lu Ming was able to confront Wang mie just now, which means he’s also extraordinary. He should be able to step onto the sixteenth step. As for Jian feiliu, Wang Mang, the three people from the heavenly corpse sect, and that young woman, they can only step onto the sixteenth step at most. In fact, they might only be able to step onto the fifteenth step.</p><p>“Your speculation is quite possible.”</p><p>Below, the crowd was in a heated discussion, expressing their own opinions.</p><p>In the midst of their discussion, Lu Ming and the rest took another step forward.</p><p>On the 15th step.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A ray of sword light, like a fairy from the heavens, went straight for the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>The sharp killing intent made Lu Ming feel that he was going to lose his life here in the next moment.</p><p>They knew that this was fake, but it felt too real. No matter who it was, they subconsciously wanted to resist, retreat, and resist.</p><p>“Come on! What do I have to fear even if I have to face mountains of daggers and seas of flames?”</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella seemed to have been pierced through. A cold feeling spread through his entire body. At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have been killed.</p><p>“My heart won’t move!”</p><p>Lu Ming murmured, his eyes determined as he looked upwards.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, there seemed to be endless wills of heaven and earth. Every one of them was extremely mysterious. However, this was not what Lu Ming wanted. He wanted to go further.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, on the 15th step, two old men let out a blood-curdling screech as they were blasted down the steps, blood spurting from their mouths.</p><p>As for the three men in gray robes from the heavenly corpse sect, two of them trembled violently and were almost blasted off. However, they roared in the end and barely managed to withstand the impact. They were also breathing heavily and sweating profusely.</p><p>The other person was Wang Mang. His body was also trembling, and his face was pale.</p><p>In addition, Jian feiliu’s body also started to tremble slightly.</p><p>“Could it be that this is my limit? No, I can become stronger. I want to become a peak expert. I want to use my strength to protect the people I love. I want to save my Junior Sister!”</p><p>Jian feiliu roared in his heart and his eyes were filled with madness.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jian feiliu was the first one to step onto the 16th step.</p><p>He was stepping forward for love. He must become stronger.</p><p>Yesterday, Lu Ming had said that as long as one was strong enough, one person could be an ancient family.</p><p>He was deeply touched by that kind of heroic spirit. He wanted to break through the limit.</p><p>On the 16th step, Jian feiliu’s body trembled violently. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth, but his eyes were still firm.</p><p>Slowly, his body calmed down, and he stood firmly on the 16th step.</p><p>Jian feiliu actually reached the 16th step and stabilized himself. Amazing, truly amazing.</p><p>that’s right. Jian feiliu is ranked 788th on the list of top 1000 talents. It’s rare for him to reach the 16th step.</p><p>generally speaking, only a few people after the 700th place on the list of top 1000 talents can reach the 16th step!</p><p>Looking at the 16th step, many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing smiled as they watched Jian feiliu step onto the 16th step.</p><p>Jian feiliu had an obsession in his heart, so he would definitely become stronger.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>It was already very difficult for him to reach the 15th step, but he didn’t expect Jian feiliu to reach the 16th step.</p><p>“How can I lose to this trash!”</p><p>Wang Mang roared in anger and stepped forward.</p><p>The next moment, his eyes were filled with fear. With a scream, his body flew far away and fell to the ground, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>On the other side, the remaining grey-robed young man from the heavenly corpse sect also stepped onto the 16th step. His eyes were filled with fear, but he didn’t fall down in the end. Instead, he slowly calmed down and sat down cross-legged on the 16th step.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
