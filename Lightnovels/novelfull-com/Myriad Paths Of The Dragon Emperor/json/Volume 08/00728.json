There are plenty of fish in the sea. Brother Jian, you have to put it down!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming patted Jian feiliu’s shoulder and did not say much.</p><p>It was difficult for outsiders to help in this kind of matter. He had to face it himself.</p><p>After that, they returned to their rooms.</p><p>Now, there were only 20 days left before the start of the Heavenly King ranking battle.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to improve his ability as soon as possible within these twenty days.</p><p>The geniuses of the six ancient families who cultivated God-tier cultivation techniques were definitely terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming himself had cultivated a divine level cultivation technique, the true war Dragon technique. He was well aware of how terrifying a divine level cultivation technique was.</p><p>The true war Dragon technique allowed him to cultivate ten times the essential core. It had always been the foundation of Lu Ming’s powerful combat strength.</p><p>In that case, even if it was a God-level technique, it would definitely be extremely terrifying.</p><p>The battle for the Heavenly King ranking would definitely be extremely brutal.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the Supreme shrine and sat cross-legged in front of the path-understanding ancient tree. He took out an earth intent crystal and started cultivating.</p><p>After the nine suns Supreme had appeared and chatted with Lian Cang, he returned to the Supreme shrine and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>He crushed the earth intent crystal, and intent tendrils spread all over Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>&Nbsp; this intent crystal was a middle-grade earth intent crystal.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a day had passed. Lu Ming had advanced the earth concept to the peak of level one lower tier. He was just one step away from breaking through to the upper tier.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a slight bottleneck.</p><p>He had actually encountered a bottleneck at the first level minor accomplishment of the earth concept. For the other concepts, Lu Ming had only encountered a bottleneck after he cultivated them to the limit of the first level in one go.</p><p>The earth essence realm was indeed a special essence realm. It was not something that the nine common essences could compare to.</p><p>Since he had reached a bottleneck, Lu Ming stopped cultivating and planned to take a walk outside.</p><p>He opened the door and walked out, only to see a figure flash by and head outside.</p><p>“Brother Jian!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>That figure was Jian feiliu. It was already night time and Jian feiliu looked a little anxious. What happened?</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he followed her.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s figure was extremely fast. He was like a Phantom as he went around a few streets and appeared in a quiet alley.</p><p>Lu Ming inscribed an array to conceal his aura and followed behind Jian feiliu silently. Jian feiliu did not notice him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming appeared on the roof of a house. He looked down and saw a lady in the alley.</p><p>She was the junior Sister apprentice of Jian feiliu.</p><p>“Why did you call me here?”</p><p>Jian feiliu looked at the woman in front of him and said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Senior brother, do you really hate me that much?” The woman looked at Jian feiliu and smiled sadly.</p><p>“Hate you? How could this be? I can’t force it. If I have to hate someone, I should hate myself. I hate myself for being born into a poor family and for having poor talent. No matter how hard I cultivate, I still can’t compare to that Wang Mang.” Jian feiliu laughed at himself.</p><p>senior brother, I was wrong. I was really wrong!</p><p>At this time, the woman suddenly smiled sadly. Her delicate body trembled and tears fell.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Jian feiliu frowned.</p><p>“Senior brother, you have to save me. I want to leave that beast. Ever since I followed him, he has never treated me as a human. He has been abusing me every day. Senior brother, I beg you. I can only rely on you now.”</p><p>The woman walked to Jian feiliu’s side, grabbed his arm, and kept crying.</p><p>She rolled up her sleeves and saw that her arms were covered with dense scars. Those scars were all from the whip.</p><p>that beast tormented me every day, whipped me, and left wounds on my body. He doesn’t even allow me to use my energy to heal my injuries. I can’t take it anymore. I want to leave him. Senior brother, I want to leave him. I shouldn’t have agreed to it. I shouldn’t have agreed.</p><p>The woman continued to cry, and her tears continued to flow.</p><p>“Beast, beast!”</p><p>Jian feiliu let out a beast-like roar.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>On the roof, Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly shifted.</p><p>Not far away, a few streaks of light were flying towards them at high speed.</p><p>swordsman, you dare to meet your old lover behind my back? you’re looking for death!</p><p>An angry roar reverberated in the world.</p><p>The next moment, three figures landed in the alley.</p><p>“Wang Mang!”</p><p>The woman screamed and her face turned pale.</p><p>Jian feiliu, how dare you touch my woman? you must die today!</p><p>A cold killing intent flashed across Wang Mang’s eyes. His body was covered in purple flames, and the temperature was terrifyingly high. The walls of the house and the floor under his feet were directly vaporized.</p><p>The temperature was so high that it could even vaporize solid rocks.</p><p>“Sky-burning flames!”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>The sky-burning flame technique was a God-level cultivation technique, the ultimate technique of the Wang family, one of the six great ancient families.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Wang Mang stepped out and leaped towards Jian feiliu. A halberd formed from flames appeared in his hand and he slashed down at Jian feiliu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes turned golden as a golden sword appeared in his hand. A golden sword light cut through the night as if it could split the dark sky.</p><p>However, it couldn’t split Wang Mang’s halberd.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying temperature burned everything. A deep pit appeared on the ground. It was vaporized by the flames. A stream of golden and purple Qi shot up into the sky and into the clouds.</p><p>“Ta!” …</p><p>Jian feiliu retreated quickly. His body glowed with golden light to resist the terrifying temperature.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>there’s a huge battle going on. What a terrifying commotion!</p><p>Nearby, countless people were alarmed and flew over. Suddenly, figures appeared in all directions.</p><p>that’s the sky-burning flame technique. He’s the Wang family’s heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Wang Mang, it’s Wang Mang. He’s ranked 700th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“The other person seems to be Jian feiliu. He’s going up against Wang Mang.”</p><p>Some people recognized the two and were quite shocked.</p><p>“Jian feiliu, is this all you have? I’m so disappointed!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s entire body glowed with purple flames, making him look like a fire god. The terrifying temperature spread in all directions, and even the air was burning. The place where Wang Mang stood became a vacuum.</p><p>He took another step forward and the flaming halberd cut through the night sky towards Jian feiliu.</p><p>The golden light on Jian feiliu’s body was almost solid. It turned into a golden armor. He put it on and a golden sword light burst out again.</p><p>But this time, Jian feiliu retreated even further. The golden light on his body trembled as if it was going to collapse.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two old men who had come with Wang Mang appeared beside the woman. One of them grabbed the woman’s shoulder.</p><p>“Senior brother!”</p><p>The woman shouted.</p><p>“B * tch, I’ll let you see with your own eyes how I’ll kill your old lover today.”</p><p>Wang Mang shouted coldly and took a step forward, charging towards Jian feiliu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
