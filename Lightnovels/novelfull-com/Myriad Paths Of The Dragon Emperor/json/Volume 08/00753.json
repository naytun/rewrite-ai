You can use them for your cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“No, this is too precious.” Although Jian feiliu desired it, he still refused.</p><p>“Brother Jian, you’re being so polite. Do you not treat me as a friend?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“How could this be? It is my honor to be friends with brother Lu!” Jian feiliu said.</p><p>“Then that’s it!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!” Jian feiliu clenched the Jade plate tightly and looked touched.</p><p>Even if they were friends, how many of them could share such a precious secret technique with him?</p><p>As for Xie nianqing, he didn’t say a word and kept the Jade card.</p><p>Hey, hey, why am I the only one who wants to buy raw stones? they don’t want them. This is unfair, this is unfair!</p><p>Kong Jin shouted.</p><p>“Because you’re so rich!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“How am I rich? It’s not fair, it’s not fair!”</p><p>Kong Jin continued to shout.</p><p>……</p><p>Before long, they had flown hundreds of thousands of miles and arrived at a remote, barren mountain.</p><p>The four of them descended. Lu Ming waved his hands and inscribed a large inscription formation on the ground.</p><p>It was no small matter to break through to the spirit ocean realm and he could not be disturbed. Lu Ming had set up an inscription formation in this area. If there was anything abnormal, he would be able to sense it.</p><p>After setting up the formation, everyone each chose a place to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the cultivation technique that you’re cultivating requires a significant amount of energy to break through to the spirit ocean realm. You can use these raw gemstones!”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked to Lu Ming and threw him a bag. Then, he turned and disappeared into a mountain.</p><p>“Two hundred raw gemstones!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened it and found two hundred low-grade raw stones inside.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and put away the rough stone. In a flash, he rushed into a mountain and appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>Dandan was lying in a corner, gnawing on spirit herbs, very leisurely.</p><p>“Brat, you’re ready to break through to the spiritual ocean tier?”</p><p>Dandan glanced at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Not bad!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>your true essence is extremely rich, and the danger of breaking through to the spirit ocean realm has increased greatly. Fortunately, you’ve cultivated four intents, so you should be fine. Let me help you guard!</p><p>Dandan walked over.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sat down cross-legged. With a wave of his hand, piles of top-grade spiritual crystals appeared in the surroundings.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had killed many enemies and gathered all their spiritual crystals. There were more than five hundred million pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that five hundred million Yuan should be enough.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a shake of his vital essence, large piles of spiritual crystals exploded and were devoured by the nine Dragon bloodline. Then, he began to refine them crazily.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and continuously transformed the energy into essential core.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The vortex spun wildly and a large amount of essential core gathered in the vortex. Lu Ming began to compress the vortex.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s Qi cyclone became smaller and smaller. However, his essential core also became more and more condensed, reaching a terrifying level.</p><p>To open up the spirit ocean, the first step was to compress the cyclone to the extreme, then it would explode.</p><p>Yes, it was an explosion.</p><p>At the moment of the explosion, a terrifying energy would be produced. In the dantian, a spirit sea would be opened.</p><p>The spirit ocean was an ocean of Zhen Yuan. The amount of Zhen Yuan it could contain was much higher than the Qi current.</p><p>There was a limit to how much true essence a Qi cyclone could hold. Without opening a spirit ocean, one would never be able to break through.</p><p>However, this process was extremely dangerous. If the cyclone exploded, a single mistake could cause the dantian to explode. It could even cause the entire body to explode and be crushed into pieces.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to protect his body with intent.</p><p>Using intent to block the energy of the explosion, the energy of the explosion would gather in a certain area and open up the spirit sea.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s essential core was too strong and condensed. Naturally, the power of the explosion would be stronger. If he only used one intent to protect himself, he would not be able to withstand it and it would be very dangerous.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had four concepts.</p><p>Compress, continue compressing.</p><p>Half a day later, the vortex concept was compressed to the extreme, forming a point. Astonishing energy spread out from within.</p><p>success or failure depends on this one move. Explode!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. With a single thought, the cyclone that had been compressed to the extreme exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>It was as if the world had just been split open. A shocking amount of energy erupted and destroyed everything.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The four intents of heaven and earth gathered together and formed layers of defense in his dantian.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The violent energy wreaked havoc. Lu Ming’s dantian was torn apart, forming a crack. This crack was growing rapidly.</p><p>Slowly, the crack turned into a pool of water, and the pool became larger and larger.</p><p>The spirit sea was opening up!</p><p>This process only happened in an instant.</p><p>The next moment, the violent energy calmed down and a pool with a diameter of about ten meters was formed.</p><p>This pool was the spirit sea.</p><p>At the beginning of a breakthrough, the area would not be very large, but as one’s cultivation level increased, it would become larger and larger.</p><p>When an ordinary person broke through to the spirit ocean, their spirit ocean would not be as large as Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming had cultivated the true war Dragon technique and he had opened up such a large area of spirit ocean at the beginning.</p><p>Lu Ming had successfully opened up the spirit sea and was not in any danger.</p><p>This was normal. After all, Lu Ming had comprehended four types of concepts and had successfully fused them. No matter how strong his essential core was, the defense of four types of concepts was enough.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. He had finally made a breakthrough to the spirit sea realm.</p><p>However, there was only a thin layer of Zhen Yuan at the bottom of the spirit ocean. Only when the Zhen Yuan in the spirit ocean was filled could one be considered to have truly entered the spirit ocean realm.</p><p>“Explode, explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to blow up the spirit crystals, devouring and refining the spiritual energy to turn it into essential core.</p><p>As the spirit crystals continued to be refined, the true essence in his spirit ocean increased and slowly filled up.</p><p>Three days later, everyone’s spiritual crystals had been used up, but their spiritual oceans were not full.</p><p>the amount of energy I’ve consumed in my cultivation is still as terrifying as ever.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed bitterly. More than 500 million Supreme spiritual crystals were not enough.</p><p>Lu Ming then took out a bag and took out two raw gemstones. He crushed them and the raw gemstones emitted their Qi.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons opened its mouth and swallowed the origin Qi.</p><p>Origin Energy was much more advanced than spirit energy. The true origin Energy in his spirit ocean quickly filled up.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming refined another fifty raw gemstones before his spirit ocean was completely filled.</p><p>“What a rich Zhen Yuan, what a rich Zhen Yuan!”</p><p>Lu Mingyuan switched to the true war Dragon technique. He felt extremely rich vital essence and was in a good mood.</p><p>The true Yuan of a spiritual ocean realm was much stronger than a King’s realm. Right now, his battle power had also increased by an unknown amount.</p><p>With a thought, he left the Supreme shrine and sensed around.</p><p>Xie nianqing and the others should still be breaking through. Lu Ming had the nine Dragons bloodline, so he was faster.</p><p>I’ll wait for them while I cultivate. I’ll cultivate my super spirit sea first.</p><p>Lu Ming re-entered the Supreme shrine and started cultivating.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
