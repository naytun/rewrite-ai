Lu Ming realized that he was standing on a platform. In front of the platform, there was a stone ladder that slanted upwards. There seemed to be another platform above it.</p><p>...</p><p>what a wonderful formation. I didn’t even notice a trace of it!</p><p>Lu Ming was rather shocked.</p><p>With his current level of inscription, he had not found a single trace. The formation here was definitely far beyond level five, no, far beyond level six. It was not something that he could pry into at his current level.</p><p>“Kid, the inscription formation here is incredible. It was definitely set up by an expert with extremely high attainments in inscription.”</p><p>Dandan, who was on Lu Ming’s shoulder, looked around.</p><p>There were not many people who could make dandan say such words.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was a brawny man in his thirties. He looked like a real person, but his expression and voice were very cold.”As long as you can defeat me, you will be able to pass the next stage!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and the sword Qi was unrestrained. A combat sword appeared in the burly man’s hand and he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Peak-tier King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. The one that appeared was indeed of the same cultivation level as him. It was a peak-tier King.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could kill martial artists of the same level in seconds.</p><p>He punched out, and the explosive fist radiance turned the figure into dust.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and went up the stone stairs to the second platform.</p><p>This time, two figures appeared on the platform.</p><p>The two figures looked exactly the same as the brawny man from before. Furthermore, they were both peak-tier Kings.</p><p>“As long as you can defeat us, you can proceed to the next stage!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sound of swords clashing could be heard. The two strong men attacked Lu Ming at the same time. Their attacks formed a wonderful network.</p><p>“Battle formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The two burly men were not launching ordinary attacks. They were cooperating to form a large array. The power was definitely not as simple as multiplying by two. Instead, it was multiplied by several times.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, it was still nothing.</p><p>He punched out, and the boundless fist force drowned the two strong men.</p><p>When the fist force disappeared, the two strong men disappeared as well.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward.</p><p>In the third stage, four strong men appeared. Similarly, the four of them joined forces to set up a formation, and its power was even more terrifying.</p><p>However, he was still crushed by Lu Ming’s exploding star fist and he managed to break through.</p><p>Fourth round, eight strong men.</p><p>Fifth round, sixteen strong men.</p><p>……</p><p>At every stage, the number of people would double, and the battle formations they set up were terrifying.</p><p>It was impossible for ordinary martial artists to make it through.</p><p>Only a few peerless geniuses could pass it.</p><p>Very quickly, he had reached the seventh level.</p><p>There were sixty-four brawny men in the seventh level, and they were all peak-tier Kings. The formation they set up was unimaginably powerful.</p><p>“It’s a good opportunity to train my intent!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the infinite Dragon Spear in his hand and maneuvered through the crowd. He fused the earth concept with the other three concepts and bombarded them continuously, tempering his own concept.</p><p>A moment later, all sixty-four strong men were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a Jade token flew towards Lu Ming. He reached out and caught it.</p><p>“What is this? Could it be my reward?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind sank into the Jade card and a hint of joy appeared on his face.</p><p>The Jade token contained a martial technique, a demigod-level martial technique.</p><p>The demigod-level martial arts technique was extremely precious. Lu Ming kept it.</p><p>As he continued to head upwards, the surrounding environment suddenly changed again. This time, Lu Ming came to an underground cave.</p><p>In the underground cave, there was a pool of water. The water was so clear that one could see the bottom.</p><p>it seems that there were a total of seven stages before. Now, we’ve arrived at another stage.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>for this round, you must count the number of ripples in the water. If you are correct, you will pass!</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard.</p><p>“Count the ripples of the water drops? It seems like this trial tests one’s observation skills.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Then, he came to the side of the pond.</p><p>A drop of water fell from above and landed on the surface of the water, creating ripples.</p><p>Lu Ming was highly focused, his eyes fixed on the surface of the water.</p><p>Layers of ripples continued to spread. At first, it was clear, but in the end, it became fainter and fainter, and finally disappeared.</p><p>a total of 1356 levels!</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“Correct. Let’s see what happens next!”</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>This time, there were two drops of water that fell into the pool.</p><p>The ripples formed by the two drops of water interfered with each other and overlapped each other. The difficulty was more than ten times higher than before.</p><p>Lu Ming had to count the number of ripples produced by the two drops of water.</p><p>After a while, the water droplet disappeared.</p><p>“Two thousand five hundred and thirty-seven!” Lu Ming answered.</p><p>correct. Continue watching!</p><p>The voice rang out again.</p><p>“There are more?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. There were three water droplets this time.</p><p>The ripples formed by the three drops of water interfered with each other, making it even more complicated.</p><p>Lu Ming observed it carefully. After a moment, the waves disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. In his mind, he kept recalling the waves that he had just seen.</p><p>“How many waves?” The voice asked.</p><p>“Three thousand six hundred!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“Congratulations on your success!”</p><p>The voice was heard, and then a sword flew over.</p><p>Lu Ming held it in his hands.</p><p>this combat sword is of such high quality. It should be a sixth-tier superior-grade combat sword!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Spirit weapons were divided into low grade, middle grade, high grade, and above high grade, there were Supreme grade and peerless grade.</p><p>Lu Ming’s infinite Dragon Spear was now a six extremes superior-grade sword. The quality of this combat sword was much higher than Lu Ming’s infinite Dragon Spear.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming could not use it.</p><p>In another cave, Xie nianqing waved his hand and grabbed a combat sword.</p><p>a Supreme-grade Lv 6 combat sword!</p><p>Xie nianqing kept it and continued walking.</p><p>Just like Lu Ming, Xie nianqing had also obtained a demigod-level martial arts technique and this combat sword.</p><p>In a cave, Jian feiliu also passed two rounds and got a demigod-level martial technique and a combat sword.</p><p>with this martial technique and combat sword, my combat strength can continue to improve!</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes revealed his excitement.</p><p>At this moment, at the foot of the sacred mountain, people were constantly being sent flying.</p><p>“There’s only Lu Ming and miss Xie left. I wonder how they’re doing?”</p><p>Chi jinkong sighed.</p><p>Almost all of the more than one hundred extraterrestrials from the red leopard tribe had failed. Only Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were still inside.</p><p>“Dad, don’t worry. I believe that Lu Ming will definitely succeed!”</p><p>Chi Yue’s eyes were bright. She had great trust in Lu Ming.</p><p>The red leopard tribe was still fine. Many tribes were already sighing in despair because they had been completely annihilated.</p><p>On the holy mountain, Lu Ming put away his combat sword and strode forward. The scene around him changed again.</p><p>In front of him, nine passages appeared, leading to the front.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. What was this test?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
