Then, they entered the ring on Xie nianqing’s hand.</p><p>...</p><p>Beautiful inscriptions appeared on the ring and two venomous snakes rushed out. The venomous snakes dispersed in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming held the ring and shook it with his essential core. The ring shattered.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming removed all the other rings on Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the ring was removed, a powerful aura emanated from Xie nianqing’s body. Then, it slowly disappeared.</p><p>“Fool, you saved my life this time, so I’ll take back my previous promise!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“What promise?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“Of course it’s a promise to trample you under my feet, you fool!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and rolled them at Lu Ming. A smile appeared on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly and touched his nose. He was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Then, his eyes flashed as he stretched out his arms and wrapped them around Xie nianqing’s waist. “Shouldn’t you repay me with your body for saving your life? It’s better to repay your kindness now.”</p><p>Feeling the heat from Lu Ming’s arm, Xie nianqing’s face turned red. He released his true energy and broke free.”Repay me with your body? You wish!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was depressed, Xie nianqing chuckled. “But it’s not impossible. It depends on your future performance.”</p><p>“Really?” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Fake!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled and asked about Lu Ming’s experience over the past few days.</p><p>The two of them began to chat.</p><p>In the red leopard tribe’s chief’s meeting hall, the atmosphere was extremely depressing.</p><p>“Chief, there’s a report from the front. The yin snake tribe has sent out a large Army and is rapidly approaching us!”</p><p>Someone reported.</p><p>“Pass on my order! There’s no need to resist at the front. Pull back all the forces and withdraw them into the ancient city.”</p><p>After Chi jinkong gave the order, he turned to the clan elders and said, ” “Elders, come with me to the city gate to ‘welcome’ Yin Buhai!”</p><p>After that, Chi jinkong and the other elders of the red leopard tribe arrived at the city gate on the west side of the ancient city. At this moment, a large Army had already been deployed around the city gate.</p><p>A few hours later, the wind howled, and the world was filled with faint sounds.</p><p>In the sky and on the ground, countless giant snake puppets appeared. On each giant snake puppet sat one or two people.</p><p>At a glance, there were at least ten thousand giant snake puppets, densely packed together, filling the entire sky.</p><p>On the city wall of the red leopard tribe, a series of dazzling inscriptions appeared. A large formation appeared, along with all kinds of powerful defensive and offensive formations. At the same time, the Warriors of the red leopard tribe drew their bows and nocked their arrows. There were runes on the arrows, and they shone brightly.</p><p>A great battle was about to start.</p><p>The chief of the yin snake tribe, Yin Buhai, walked out and stood in the air. A venomous snake was wrapped around his neck and flicking its tongue.</p><p>Yin Buhai’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He looked at Chi jinkong and said, ” Chi jinkong, your daughter Chi Yue and two outsiders are despicable. They snuck into the yin snake tribe’s territory and killed my son, Yin que. Now, hand over the three of them, and I’ll retreat and let the red leopard tribe off this time!</p><p>haha, Yin Buhai, you’re really good at making things up. I heard that it was your son who wanted to defile someone else’s girlfriend and was killed in anger. He was killed in a direct attack. How can you call it a sneak attack? ”</p><p>Chi jinkong laughed.</p><p>“Hmph, what defile? it’s that b * tch’s honor that my son likes her. What are their lowly lives worth? How can you compare yourself to my son? Chi jinkong, I advise you to look at the situation clearly. Don’t bring about the extermination of your red leopard tribe!”</p><p>Yin Buhai said coldly.</p><p>“Impossible!” Chi jinkong’s reply was decisive.</p><p>Yin Buhai frowned and his face turned even gloomier. His eyes flickered and he said, ” how about this, Chi jinkong? I know you can’t bear to part with your daughter. I don’t want you to hand over Chi Yue, but as long as you hand over the two extraterrestrials, I’ll retreat!</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Chi jinkong replied with the same two words.</p><p>Yin Buhai’s face darkened. He said, ” Chi jinkong, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. I’ll give you three days to discuss it. If you don’t hand over the two people after three days, I will personally lead the Army and raze the red leopard tribe to the ground. I will make sure that the red leopard tribe will be wiped out forever!</p><p>After saying that, Yin Buhai waved his hand and led his men away. Not long after, the yin snake tribe’s Army had all left.</p><p>It was not that he was not afraid of the red leopard tribe. The main thing was that he had hurriedly assembled an Army this time, and their strength was not very strong. If he rashly attacked the red leopard tribe, he was afraid that both sides would suffer losses.</p><p>He also needed time to gather more power.</p><p>As the yin snake tribe retreated, Chi jinkong let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>pass down my order. Gather all the forces of the red leopard tribe and send them back to guard the ancient city. Elders, follow me back to the meeting hall!</p><p>Chi jinkong ordered. A moment later, the meeting hall of the red leopard tribe was filled with more than 20 people.</p><p>Not only were the elders of the red leopard tribe present, but there were also many ordinary elders.</p><p>tribe leader, in my opinion, we should just hand over the two young men. Why start a war with the yin snake tribe for two outsiders? ”</p><p>that’s right, chief. Those two young men were overconfident. They actually dared to kill Yin que. They were looking for death. We can’t drag the red leopard tribe down because of two people from the outer realm!</p><p>Some of the ordinary elders urged Chi jinkong to hand over Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Chi jinkong’s voice was heard.</p><p>“No? Why not, chief?” An ordinary elder asked doubtfully.</p><p>“I won’t hide it from you. Lu Ming was able to break the formation that sealed the previous clan leader. Now, he has already broken 100 formations. There are only 36 left. He will be able to break all of them in a few days. At that time, we will be able to find the secret inscription manual of our tribe and return our red leopard tribe to its former peak!”</p><p>Said Chi jinkong. His voice was like a storm that swept across the entire place.</p><p>“What? There’s such a thing?”</p><p>Many ordinary elders were shocked. Then, they fell silent. They finally knew why Chi jinkong was protecting Lu Ming.</p><p>This was related to the rise and fall of the red leopard tribe.</p><p>“Patriarch, I don’t think so!”</p><p>A voice rang out, it was from the pure gold Mountain.</p><p>With such a major event happening, he was naturally summoned back for a discussion.</p><p>Pure gold Mountain walked out and said loudly, ” there are still thirty-six more sealing arrays left. It’s still unknown whether that Lu Ming can really break them. Moreover, even if he can break them, so what if we get the inscription refinement secret manual? ” The yin snake tribe destroyed our tribe before we could even rise to power. I think we should hand over Lu Ming and that woman to stabilize the yin snake tribe first. That way, at least we won’t be destroyed!”</p><p>The pure gold Mountain’s words caused many elders to fall into deep thought.</p><p>Indeed, the pure gold Mountain’s words were not without reason.</p><p>If the tribe was annihilated, what was the point of obtaining the inscription secret manual?</p><p>Chi jinkong also frowned. He could not refute this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
