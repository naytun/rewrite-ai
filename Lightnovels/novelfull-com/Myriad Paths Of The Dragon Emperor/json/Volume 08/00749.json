His spine twisted like a dragon and shook slightly, clashing with Jiang Taixu’s palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a dull boom, Jiang Taixu’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu cried out in disbelief.</p><p>His palm, which could break through everything, hit Lu Ming’s waist. Not only did it not cut Lu Ming into two, but it was also forced back by Lu Ming.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>How could he know the marvels of the prison suppressing heavenly art?</p><p>Not only could the prison suppressing heaven technique be cultivated to the hands and feet, but it could also be cultivated to the other parts of the body. At the highest level, every muscle in the body would be able to unleash the immense power of the prison suppressing heaven technique, suppressing everything.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing heaven technique had made further progress. Not only could he attack with his hands and feet, but he could also attack with his waist. Just now, he had used the prison-suppressing heaven technique with his waist and forced Jiang Taixu back.</p><p>what a terrifying bloodline martial technique! It must be a demigod-level bloodline martial technique!</p><p>Dongfang Hao’s eyes glowed as he spoke slowly.</p><p>“Demigod-level bloodline martial technique? It’s really terrifying!”</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>Generally speaking, to comprehend a demigod level martial technique from the bloodline, one would need to be at sea of soul realm and above. Moreover, it was very difficult for ordinary bloodlines. Only those with divine bloodlines could easily comprehend demigod level bloodline martial techniques.</p><p>In order to unleash the power of a demigod level martial technique, one would need to be at least at the sea of soul realm. At the king’s realm, one’s Zhen Yuan would not be strong enough, so they would not be able to unleash much power.</p><p>However, it was obvious that Lu Ming had comprehended a demigod-level bloodline martial art technique when he was only in the king’s realm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s left hand burst out with a terrifying devouring power that enveloped the Jiang family members. His right hand was like a prison-suppressing stele that pressed down.</p><p>Enveloped by the devouring power, the members of the Jiang family felt that their bloodline power was unstable, and their blood essence was faintly throbbing. Their combat strength had weakened even more.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With one palm and one kick, Lu Ming killed two Jiang family experts.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming had killed six Jiang family experts. He was extremely ferocious.</p><p>“How can he be so strong? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes were wide open, as if he could not accept this.</p><p>“Jiang Taixu has lost his will to fight. He’s definitely going to lose!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>run! Run! This man is a monster! Run!</p><p>Jiang Taixu suddenly shouted. His confidence had completely collapsed. He turned around and ran toward the exit.</p><p>The exit was like a door. Once one ran in, they would be transported out.</p><p>“You can’t run away!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his body was like a stream of light. He caught up with Jiang Taixu in a few moments and struck his palm at Jiang Taixu.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jiang Taixu was sent flying. He coughed up blood and his eyes were full of fear.</p><p>“Save me, save me! Wang Jue, fight back, save me!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted.</p><p>At this moment, he no longer had his previous arrogance and the ambition he had before the start of the Heavenly King ranking battle. He was simply like a pitiful rat crossing the street, a pitiful worm.</p><p>Right now, he didn’t want anything but to live.</p><p>However, at this moment, how could Wang Jue and Ni Zhan save him?</p><p>They themselves were extremely shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a group of figures flew over and stopped in the distance.</p><p>“First ghost, save me. Let’s work together and kill this man. Did you see how much Qi He has? with him around, you won’t be able to get first place.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted madly.</p><p>The people who came later were the experts of the heavenly corpse sect. The leader was a young man who was covered in a black robe. His eyes were full of ghostly Qi.</p><p>First ghost’s eyes swept across and he was shocked. However, when he saw the stele Qi in the Heavenly King stele’s shadow above Lu Ming’s head, his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s monument Qi was much more than his. Not only Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and even Kong Jin had more monument Qi than him.</p><p>First ghost was also one of the ten Heavenly Kings of the last Heavenly King List, ranked ninth. He wanted to get first place too.</p><p>first ghost, hurry up and attack. If this man rises up, it will be bad for your heavenly corpse sect!</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted.</p><p>“Shameless!”</p><p>In the outside world, many people looked down on him.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was too shameless. He actually wanted to join forces with GUI Yi to kill Lu Ming, and the reason was that Lu Ming’s rise would be detrimental to the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was a member of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, and so was Lu Ming.</p><p>This caused the anger of many people from the Empyrean heaven divine Palace to soar to the heavens.</p><p>The Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect were mortal enemies.</p><p>Dongfang Hao and the others also shook their heads.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s words would definitely be punished when they got back to the Jiang family.</p><p>Jiang Taixu also knew that he would be despised and disdained if these words were spread, but he had no choice. What was more important than his life now?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was struck by Lu Ming’s palm again. His arm, which was harder than a spirit weapon, was shattered.</p><p>“First ghost, attack!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>First ghost’s eyes flashed and he was about to step forward.</p><p>first ghost, I advise you not to make a move. Even I’m not sure if I can defeat this person!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared beside first ghost and a hoarse voice came out.</p><p>It was the corpse King!</p><p>“Even you don’t have the confidence to defeat him?”</p><p>First ghost’s eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>“Yes, didn’t you see how miserable Jiang Taixu was? If you make a move, you might die Here. It’s better for us to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight!”</p><p>The corpse King said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>First ghost let out a long breath and took a few steps back, but he didn’t attack.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted in despair.</p><p>“Jiang Taixu, no one can save you today.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, spare me! I’m the Jiang family’s Supreme talent. Killing me won’t do you any good. Spare me!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu finally began to beg for mercy.</p><p>“It’s even worse for me to spare you! Kill!”</p><p>The terrifying devouring power enveloped Jiang Taixu and his palm struck down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Half of Jiang Taixu’s body had exploded, and he was only left with half a breath. His eyes were full of despair and pleading.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move. He took a step forward and Jiang Taixu was torn into pieces.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, who was ranked sixth on the previous Heavenly King ranking and was thought to be number one, was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The devouring power burst out and Jiang Taixu’s blood essence was devoured.</p><p>Currently, devouring the blood essence of a peak-tier King was not of much help to Lu Ming, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, we’ll retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, Wang Jue, Luan Zhan, and the others no longer had the will to fight. They retreated frantically and flew toward the exit.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was dead, and the rest of the Jiang family had escaped. Even if they stayed, they would probably end up in a miserable state.</p><p>Wang Jue took the lead and broke through Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field, flying toward the exit.</p><p>The other members of the Wang family followed suit.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room. He took a step forward and turned into a stream of light, rushing toward the Wang family.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Before he had even arrived, a fist radiance was blasted out, blocking one of the Wang family members.</p><p>This person was Wang mie.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
