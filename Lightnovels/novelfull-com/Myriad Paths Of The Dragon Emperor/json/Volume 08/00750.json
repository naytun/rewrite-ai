Didn’t you and Wang Mang join forces to knock me down the abyss when we were challenging the Heavenly King tablet? I’m a person who bears grudges.”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>The other members of the Wang clan couldn’t care less about Wang mie as they all rushed to the exit.</p><p>no, no, that was a moment of folly. Please, please let me go!</p><p>Wang mie’s face turned pale and he almost peed his pants.</p><p>Lu Ming was a devil and a ruthless man. He did not even let Jiang Taixu off. He had no fear of the Jiang family, so why would he be afraid of the Wang family? therefore, he did not dare to mention the Wang family and could only beg for mercy.</p><p>“It’s too late!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>“Ah, I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>Seeing that begging for mercy was useless, Wang mie could only go all out. However, facing Lu Ming who had unleashed his strongest combat strength, his outcome was already set.</p><p>With a single palm, it was torn into pieces.</p><p>The storage ring and blood essence would belong to Lu Ming. Of course, there was also the stele Qi.</p><p>At this moment, the Luan family, Wang Jue, and the others had already rushed into the door and disappeared.</p><p>this Lu Ming is quite bold. He’s not giving the Wang family any face at all.</p><p>In the outside world, Wang Yan licked his lips as a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s expression was also not good.</p><p>In his opinion, no matter how weak Jiang Taixu was, he was still the Jiang family’s chosen warrior. Lu Ming had killed Jiang Taixu in front of everyone, which was an insult to the Jiang family.</p><p>In the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, how many people would dare to not give face to the ancient aristocratic families?</p><p>This made them feel embarrassed.</p><p>In their position, they didn’t care about the life and death of Jiang Taixu and Wang mie, but it was a great sin to ignore the ancient families and embarrass them.</p><p>“This Lu Ming previously said in public that the Wang family was nothing. He alone is an ancient family!”</p><p>An old man from the Wang family walked up to Wang Yan.</p><p>“One person is an ancient family, and you speak so arrogantly. You’re just a mere king tier. No matter how strong your battle-power is, what’s the use? When faced with a stronger opponent, he would be able to suppress them with a single hand!”</p><p>Wang Yan’s eyes flashed with anger.</p><p>“He really doesn’t know the immensity of the heavens and earth!” Jiang Taichong also spoke.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not know that two top 100 talents on the list of top 1000 talents had appeared outside. He also did not know that he had already offended them.</p><p>However, even if he knew, he would not care.</p><p>His eyes looked in the direction of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>He didn’t have a good impression of the sky corpse sect. If he had the chance, he wouldn’t mind killing a few geniuses of the sky corpse sect.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The corpse King stepped out, shaking the earth and sky. Corpse Qi filled his body, flowing like liquid.</p><p>His eyes were filled with ferocity and a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re very strong. I’m not sure if I can defeat you in a real battle. However, this is only the Heavenly King ranking. You and I are both in the king’s realm. In the face of the battle of Providence, this is just a small fight. We’ll meet in the battle of Providence. How about it?”</p><p>The corpse King’s hoarse voice sounded.</p><p>“The battle of karmic luck? Good! I hope you won’t disappoint me when the time comes!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his eyes full of fighting spirit.</p><p>This King corpse gave him a sense of danger. He was definitely a terrifying opponent that Jiang Taixu couldn’t compare with.</p><p>that’s exactly what I wanted to say. Don’t die before the battle of Kismet. There aren’t many good opponents!</p><p>The corpse King then looked at Xie nianqing and Kong Jin. His eyes were also filled with battle intent. Then, he strode towards the exit.</p><p>As the corpse King stepped in, the others also followed and disappeared into the portal.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the other two stepped into the portal.</p><p>The next moment, they appeared outside the Heavenly King monument, at the edge of the abyss.</p><p>“Lu Ming, look! There are names on the divine King monument!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming looked back. As expected, golden names had appeared on the stele. They were the rankings of the Heavenly King ranking battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name was written on the first place.</p><p>Lu Ming, first place.</p><p>Without a doubt, Lu Ming had obtained the most Qi. He had killed many experts from the Jiang and Wang family and even Jiang Taixu, obtaining all their Qi.</p><p>His stele Qi had already far surpassed the others.</p><p>Second place, Xie nianqing!</p><p>This was not surprising. Previously, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had joined forces to kill many experts from the Jiang and Wang families. Xie nianqing had also obtained a lot of stele Qi.</p><p>Third place, corpse King.</p><p>Fourth place, Kong Jin.</p><p>Fifth place, Dongfang Yu. Sixth place, GUI Yi. Seventh place, Wang Jue …</p><p>On it, a series of rankings appeared.</p><p>Jian feiliu also appeared on the ranking, entering the top one hundred and eight.</p><p>On the other side of the abyss, there were more than 100000 people looking in this direction. Their eyes were filled with all sorts of emotions. There was envy, jealousy, hatred, and so on.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>After Lu Ming was born, the four of them flew across the abyss.</p><p>Above their heads, there was still the Heavenly King stele’s illusionary shadow floating. This kind of Heavenly King stele’s illusionary shadow could help them ascend the dark red steps at the top of the first Heavenly King stele without being pressured or attacked.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest came over, the crowd took the initiative to make way for them.</p><p>The combat strength of Lu Ming’s group of four had become stronger. With just the four of them, they had actually defeated the joint attack of nearly eighty experts from the Jiang, Wang, and Luan families. It was truly unbelievable.</p><p>Many people looked at them with respect in their eyes.</p><p>Although they were all peak-tier Kings, Lu Ming and the rest were much stronger than the others.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, two vast and incomparable pressures suddenly pressed down on Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, and Jian feiliu’s expressions changed drastically. They unleashed their powers to resist the attack. Even so, the four of them trembled and kept retreating. Jian feiliu, in particular, was coughing up blood.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique in his body. He stomped on the ground and stabilized himself. He looked up.</p><p>In the sky, two young men stepped through the air.</p><p>One of them was covered in purple flames like a Purple Sun, emitting a terrifying temperature.</p><p>The other one showed off his abilities, like a peerless divine weapon.</p><p>“The Jiang family and the Wang family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. It was easy to distinguish the aura that the two of them emitted.</p><p>“Could it be that Jiang Taichong and Wang Yan are going to make a move on Lu Ming and the rest?”</p><p>they’re the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents. Their cultivation has long reached an extremely high level. Lu Ming and the others are only in the king’s realm. It’s a little unreasonable for them to fight against a King’s realm expert with their cultivation, right? ”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. After all, Lu Ming just killed Jiang Taixu and many experts from the two families.”</p><p>Whispers could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill the Jiang family’s prodigy? do you know your crime?”</p><p>Jiang Taichong’s eyes shot out two beams of sharp light like two divine swords.</p><p>life and death are determined by fate in the Heavenly King stele. It’s meant to kill each other and seize the stele Qi. If we can’t kill the people from the ancient families, is there still a need to hold the Heavenly King ranking battle in the future? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless. His eyes were like lightning as he shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
