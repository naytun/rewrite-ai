With Lu Ming here, the three of them would be able to charge out with ruan Tingting.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he swept a glance at Jiang Taiyou and the rest.</p><p>He really wanted to go all out and kill these people.</p><p>However, he also knew that it was more important to take ruan Tingting and rush over.</p><p>There would be plenty of opportunities to kill Jiang Taiyou, Luan Xiongfei, and the others.</p><p>“Boy, you’re Lu Ming?”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taiyou’s eyes were cold and sharp.</p><p>The Jiang family’s prodigy, Jiang Taixu, had been killed by Lu Ming during the Heavenly King ranking battle. This news had long spread among the younger generation of the Jiang family.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was not an ordinary heaven’s favorite. In the king’s realm, he had only suppressed himself and could enter the Sea of Souls realm at any time. Once he entered the Sea of Souls realm, his cultivation would definitely improve by leaps and bounds, and he might even awaken a divine bloodline and enter the ranks of the God’s favorite.</p><p>However, he was too ambitious. He had been suppressing his cultivation and wanted to become the first on the Heavenly King ranking to increase his Foundation and rise higher in the future. However, he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The higher-ups of the Jiang family were furious.</p><p>Among the younger generation of the Jiang family, many of them wanted to kill Lu Ming to gain a righteous reputation.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied coldly.</p><p>alright, I was just about to find you. Since you’ve come here yourself, I’ll send you on your way!</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s voice rang out faintly. In the next moment, his figure flashed like a sword of Shadows, stabbing towards Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed and from a tricky angle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a sneer. Without even looking, he swept his long spear across. The dazzling Spear’s gleam emitted a sharp whistling sound and filled the surroundings.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s figure appeared. His palm struck the Spear’s shaft and bounced back.</p><p>“Then I’ll Cut You Down head on!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou strolled forward. Sword will shot up into the sky from his entire body. He was like a peerless divine sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He swung his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped forward. He extended his palm and struck at Jiang Taiyou’s palm.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the people watching the battle flashed.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually going against Jiang Taiyou with his body of flesh and blood. Was he not courting death?</p><p>Who didn’t know that the Jiang family cultivated the immemorial divine weapon technique? their bodies were like divine weapons, indestructible, incomparably sharp, and could break anything.</p><p>He could not even block it with a spirit weapon, but Lu Ming was using his body?</p><p>At this moment, the members of the Jiang family sneered. They were looking forward to seeing Lu Ming’s palm being cut in half.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and Jiang Taiyou’s palm collided. It was as if two Spirit weapons had clashed.</p><p>A sharp aura spread out in all directions.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, the sound of bones breaking was heard. Jiang Taiyou’s expression changed and he let out a low roar like an injured beast. He retreated rapidly.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes could not help but fall on Jiang Taiyou. To be precise, they fell on his palm, which was bleeding and had been seriously deformed.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s palm was unscathed.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, Lu Ming actually had the upper hand. He had cracked the bone armor of Jiang Taiyou’s palm with one palm. How was this possible?</p><p>Jiang Taiyou was an existence who had cultivated the immemorial divine weapon technique.</p><p>The people from the Jiang family were the most shocked. They knew better than anyone else that Jiang Taiyou’s immemorial divine weapon technique had a profound level of mastery and he had comprehended sword will. His palm was extremely sharp, but now, his spine had been broken by Lu Ming’s flesh and blood.</p><p>This was a huge blow to their confidence.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou kept growling. His palm was covered in black light and crackling sounds could be heard. It was healing rapidly.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, and ruan Tingting rushed out of the cave.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged toward Jiang Taiyou.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>kill! Jiang Taiyou shouted. Suddenly, another Jiang family’s Paragon lunged at Lu Ming. This Paragon was also in the top 500 and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Meanwhile, Luan Tianhao, Luan Xiongfei, and the others charged toward Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was wild. He circulated the prison suppressing heavenly art and the true war Dragon technique at full force, launching a crazy attack.</p><p>The members of the Jiang family were like divine weapons, and their limbs were killing weapons. The others could only keep a distance from them, or it would be dangerous.</p><p>However, Lu Ming cultivated the prison destructive Divine Art. His hands and feet seemed to contain the divine monument and could suppress everything. He was also good at close combat.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck out and he lifted his leg to kick out. His power was shocking as he fought against the two Jiang family’s elites. The rumbling sounds continued. For a moment, he actually suppressed the two Jiang family’s elites, which shocked everyone.</p><p>In the past few days, Lu Ming’s cultivation and physical body had improved. Naturally, his combat strength had increased as well. If it were a few days ago, he would not have been able to achieve this.</p><p>The onlookers in the distance were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Charge out from this side!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss, his essential core boiling, and his attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>haha, amazing! Watch me! I’ll smash it!</p><p>Dandan stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder and laughed heartily. Then, she suddenly leaped out, her four limbs retracted into the turtle shell, and she smashed toward Jiang Taiyou’s face.</p><p>During this period of time, dandan had swallowed a lot of spirit herbs and recovered a little, and her aura was stronger.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou was suddenly attacked by dandan and was hit in the face by dandan.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Dandan was bounced back and shouted, ” “Nest, what thick skin, I can’t smash it!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s body was as strong as a divine weapon, but he was still a little dizzy after being hit by dandan. Lu Ming seized the opportunity and swept his leg out, kicking Jiang Taiyou so hard that he spat out blood and retreated.</p><p>They were about to break out of the siege.</p><p>At that moment, a terrifying howl was heard. An extremely sharp aura and cold killing intent enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Danger, extreme danger!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt his hair stand on end.</p><p>In the distance, an arrow shot toward Lu Ming’s back like a stream of light.</p><p>Fast, it was too fast!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other Jiang family’s Paragon launched a frenzied attack at Lu Ming. He wanted to stall Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the person who shot the arrow was extremely powerful and was definitely far more powerful than Jiang Taiyou and the others. He had not expected that such a powerful person would launch a sneak attack and attack Jiang Taiyou and the other person with all his might. It was too late to Dodge now.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed. She used the sky demon force field to cover her. Within the sky demon force field, her speed was as fast as lightning.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure flashed and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the arrow had already arrived.</p><p>Xie nianqing didn’t even have the time to launch a powerful attack. He could only use his destructive cutting power to rush toward the arrow.</p><p>However, the arrow was terrifyingly powerful. It instantly destroyed all the destructive cutting power and shot through the sky demon power field.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
