The spear was dark red in color, and it was filled with a scorching flame aura.</p><p>Around the long spear, there were at least 100 figures sitting with their legs crossed. These people were all trained in the fire concept.</p><p>Lu Ming asked around. It was said that this long spear was a weapon used by an expert at the peak of the spiritual God Realm. The long spear was broken because he had a great battle with someone. That expert then stuck the broken long spear upside down here.</p><p>However, this spear still contained the fire concept that the powerhouse had comprehended. It had not dissipated even after thousands of years.</p><p>It could be said to be a Holy Land for cultivating the concept of fire.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the place for a while, then chose a place and sat cross-legged.</p><p>However, he did not notice that not far away from Lu Ming, there was a young man who was carefully sizing him up. His eyes were flickering.</p><p>“Recently, Shangguan jinjue and Miao Yi have been looking for a young man. Shangguan jinjue just came here a few days ago, and from their description, he looks very similar to this man. Hehe, if I pass the news to Shangguan jinjue and Miao Yi, I’ll probably get a lot of rewards!”</p><p>The young man sneered. He took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent out two messages.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue was standing on a mountain peak with his hands behind his back. Suddenly, his expression changed and a jade talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>With a sweep of his mind, a cold smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.”Brat, I’ve finally found you. Let’s go!”</p><p>With a flash, he disappeared.</p><p>In the sky above a mountain range, Miao Yi was flying with a few people. Suddenly, a voice transmission jade talisman appeared in his hand. After scanning it with his mind, a sinister expression appeared on his face.</p><p>“Brat, I’ve found you. I’ll see how you die for offending me!”</p><p>Then, Miao Yi led a few people and headed in the direction of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming studied it quietly. The owner of the spear was extremely powerful. His comprehension of the concept of fire had also reached an astonishing level, which was a great inspiration for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his fire concept could break through the bottleneck at any time and enter the realm of level two lower tier.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating here for a day.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a terrifying killing intent. A sharp sword Qi was coming at him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. His body flashed and he moved a few meters away.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A sharp sword Qi struck the spot where Lu Ming had been sitting cross-legged, creating a bottomless hole.</p><p>The others nearby were also shocked. They all ended their cultivation and appeared in the sky.</p><p>Although they had comprehended the fire intent here, each of them had split a part of their attention to observe the surroundings. After all, they had to be on guard against others.</p><p>After Lu Ming moved a few meters away, his figure flashed and he appeared in the air. His cold eyes swept in one direction.</p><p>It was a tall young man wearing a starry robe. He had an extraordinary aura.</p><p>Behind him, there were three young men in their late twenties, all wearing long starry robes.</p><p>“Who are you? Why did you attack me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He did not know any of these people, but they wanted to kill him.</p><p>Before the young man in the starry robe could speak, there were already exclamations around him.</p><p>“It’s him, Shangguan jinjue!”</p><p>he’s here again. He came here a few days ago. Could it be to find this person? ”</p><p>“It can’t be wrong! Who was this person? He actually offended the Shangguan family and made the Golden Lord of Shangguan spend so much effort to find him.”</p><p>The words of the people around made Lu Ming come to a realization.</p><p>He was probably here for Shangguan Wu Chen and the others.</p><p>“Why? How dare you injure a direct descendant of the Shangguan family! You deserve to die! Now, I’m here to take your head back!”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue’s eyes sparkled with Starlight as he spoke in an overbearing manner.</p><p>“Take my head? Hahaha, I’ve already shown mercy to those guys, but in your eyes, it’s a capital crime. It seems that if I don’t show some thunderous means, everyone will think that I’m easy to manipulate!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>After he came to ninedragons, his methods were much gentler. The main reason was that he had just arrived here, and this place was full of big forces and big families. His strength was too weak, so he decided to keep a low profile and endure it for a while. He wanted to use the cultivation resources in ninedragons to quickly improve his strength.</p><p>But now he found that forbearance was not a solution at all. The more you forbear and the gentler your methods are, the more others will bully you.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. Who Do You Think You Are? How dare he compare himself with the direct descendant of the Shangguan family! Kill him!”</p><p>Shangguan jinjue waved his hand, and three young men strode out from behind him. Their bodies were filled with dazzling Starlight.</p><p>The bloodline awakened by the Shangguan family’s disciples was related to the stars, and there were all kinds of stars.</p><p>All kinds of star bloodlines appeared above the three young men’s heads. There was the saber star, the giant sword star, and the flying bird star.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a loud shout, the three young men strode out. Dazzling Starlight condensed into a saber, a giant sword, and a flying bird, all of which were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The three youths were all experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then be prepared to be killed by me. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss. The essential core in his body exploded and a tsunami-like sound was heard.</p><p>His palm struck out like a divine monument.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the Starlight sabers was shattered, and the young man’s chest caved in. With a miserable cry, he was blasted to the ground and died on the spot.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming twisted his body and swept out with his leg. This kick was also driven by the prison-suppressing heavenly art. The giant sword shattered and the body of the young man from the Shangguan family exploded.</p><p>Two moves, killing two people in a row, the momentum was like thunder.</p><p>The remaining young man turned pale with fright and counterattacked with all his might, his figure retreating rapidly.</p><p>“Gokudo path attack!”</p><p>A ray of spear light flashed past, and a large hole appeared between the eyebrows of the last young man. His eyes were wide open, full of unwillingness.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard from all around.</p><p>Three experts at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier were actually killed by Lu Ming in three moves. This was too terrifying.</p><p>The most important thing was that Lu Ming was decisive and merciless.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue’s pupils constricted. Lu Ming’s combat strength was beyond his imagination.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, if you want to kill me, then be prepared to be killed by me! Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to Shangguan jinjue.</p><p>your combat strength is not bad. It’s beyond my expectations. That’s good. It’ll be more enjoyable to kill like this!</p><p>A cruel look flashed across Shangguan jinjue’s eyes. A violent star power spread out from his body.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>On top of Shangguan jinjue’s head, a Star Wolf howled at the sky, showing its ferocity.</p><p>This was the star of ravenous Wolf, a legendary and extremely powerful star.</p><p>“Sky Wolf slash!”</p><p>A saber appeared in Shangguan jinjue’s hand. He swung the saber, and the wolf howled, filling the sky with Starlight.</p><p>Without a doubt, Shangguan jinjue had also comprehended the star will.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The palm and the blade light met, making a violent roar.</p><p>Heaven and earth shook violently as the two figures separated upon contact.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
