The powerful inertia carried Xie nianqing back.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. After forcing the Jiang family’s elite to retreat with a single palm strike, he took advantage of the situation and wrapped his arm around Xie nianqing’s slender waist. He took a step forward and landed beside the cave.</p><p>“Fatty, retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>Kong Jin didn’t go very far with ruan Tingting, but with a roar, he rushed back.</p><p>“Little Qing, how is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing in his arms and kept injecting his vital essence to seal Xie nianqing’s wound, stopping the blood from flowing out.</p><p>“Fortunately, I avoided my vital parts, so I won’t die!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was pale.</p><p>“Now, where can you run to?” Jiang Taiyou’s face was cold as he stepped forward.</p><p>Luan Tianhao and the rest also came over and surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not even look at them. His gaze was directed in another direction.</p><p>A young man wearing a black iron battle suit, with a cold gaze, stepped in the air.</p><p>His body exuded a terrifying aura and a strong will to fight.</p><p>“Chaotic wind cloud! It’s chaotic wind cloud!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others are finished. The Luan family actually sent Luan Fengyun!</p><p>ranked 350th on the list of top 1000 talents, quasi-God-tier heaven’s favorite, Luan Feng Yun!</p><p>The exclamations were getting louder and louder.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. The person who had ambushed him was this person.</p><p>“Fatty, bring Tingting and little Qing back to the cave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Kong Jin’s face was solemn as he led ruan Tingting and Xie nianqing into the cave.</p><p>Xie nianqing sat cross-legged and began to heal.</p><p>Although the arrow had injured his vital parts, the intent contained in it was extremely powerful. Xie nianqing’s injury was not as light as it looked.</p><p>Luan Fengyun stepped forward and stood in the air. He said in a calm voice, ” Luan Tianhao, you’re too slow. This matter has already reached Di Tian’s Imperial Guards, and they’ll soon send someone over to take that woman away. After all, she’s obtained supremacy lanjin’s inheritance, and supremacy lanjin was one of the commanders of Di Tian’s Imperial Guards back then!</p><p>“Then what should we do?” Luan Tianhao’s expression changed.</p><p>If Di Tian’s Imperial Guards were here, then there would be no need for him to mess up the family.</p><p>the clan head will think of a way to delay Di Tian’s Imperial Guards for a day, so he sent me here to capture this woman as soon as possible and bring her back to the chaotic clan!</p><p>“I’m sorry,” said Luan Fengyun. He then turned to look at Lu Ming with a cold smile on his face.”If you get lost now, you’ll live. If you delay, you’ll die!”</p><p>“Luan Fengyun, I’ll definitely kill you one day!”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored Luan Fengyun’s words. His eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Luan Fengyun had almost killed Xie nianqing. Based on this, Lu Ming had to kill him no matter who he was.</p><p>hehe, from the moment you said that, you no longer have a chance. I didn’t want to fight and only take that woman away. But today, I have to kill you!</p><p>Said Luan Fengyun coldly. He stood high up in the air, his fighting spirit growing stronger.</p><p>The Luan family cultivated a divine-grade cultivation technique, the hundred battles technique, and were born to fight.</p><p>Of course, his combat strength was also extremely powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s aura suddenly exploded. His essential core boiled and emitted the sound of stormy waves. His aura was like a divine mountain that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The peak of the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, this was the cultivation of Luan Fengyun.</p><p>The peak of the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier was two levels higher than Lu Ming. However, Luan Fengyun was no ordinary martial artist. He was a quasi-god level prodigy, and his combat strength was already incomparably powerful.</p><p>The essential core in Lu Ming’s body circulated at full force. There was a faint blue light shining between his eyebrows.</p><p>haha, I didn’t expect this place to be so lively. Add me in then!</p><p>A loud laugh came from afar. As soon as the voice fell, a scorching aura covered the sky and earth.</p><p>Two streaks of flames, dragging a long tail behind them, pierced through the void and approached in an instant.</p><p>Two young figures appeared.</p><p>“Wang Haotian!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s eyes flashed.</p><p>At this moment, gasps of shock could be heard from the surroundings.</p><p>The Wang clan’s heaven’s pride expert had also arrived. Moreover, he was also a quasi-God heaven’s pride expert.</p><p>brother Luan, supremacy Blue Gold’s inheritance has appeared. Isn’t it a little too much for your Luan family to want to keep it for yourself? ”</p><p>Wang Haotian laughed.</p><p>“Do you think I have to inform your Wang family?” Luan Fengyun said, his face dark.</p><p>Wang Haotian’s ranking on the list of top 1000 talents was only a few places lower than his, but his combat strength was on par with his. It would not be easy for Wang Haotian to get a God-level cultivation method today.</p><p>“It’s fine if you don’t tell me. We’ll rely on our own abilities!” Wang Haotian smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept past Wang Haotian and landed on the person behind him.</p><p>Wang Kong!</p><p>In Wang Kong’s hand was a pale-faced man who was breathing weakly.</p><p>Jian feiliu. The person in Wang Kong’s hand was actually Jian feiliu.</p><p>“Brother Jian, what did you guys do to him?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like two sharp swords, piercing Wang Kong and Wang Haotian.</p><p>“Are you talking about this good-for-nothing?”</p><p>Wang Haotian smiled and looked at Jian feiliu with disdain. this brat has the audacity to have an affair with a woman of my Wang family. So, I crippled him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>No wonder Jian feiliu was so weak. It was because his cultivation had been destroyed.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice.</p><p>After this period of time, Lu Ming had already regarded Jian feiliu as a true friend. Now, Jian feiliu’s cultivation had been crippled by Wang Haotian.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry about me. I’m a piece of trash. I can’t even save my Junior Sister. They killed her!”</p><p>you’re all animals, all animals! Junior Sister is a married woman, and you still want to reward her to someone else, you animals!</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes were red as he growled.</p><p>Hmph, that Wang Mang fellow is already dead. Our Wang clan isn’t going to raise him for nothing. Naturally, we have to make the best use of him! Wang Kong said indifferently, as if he was talking about a very normal thing.</p><p>Lu Ming had more or less understood what was going on.</p><p>It must be because Wang Mang was dead, and the Wang family wanted to reward Jian feiliu’s junior Sister to the other Wang family disciples to play with. Jian feiliu’s junior Sister must have sent a message to Jian feiliu asking for help, which was why Jian feiliu left in a hurry and came to ninedragons.</p><p>After that, he was naturally discovered.</p><p>Jian feiliu was right. The Wang clan was a group of beasts.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I heard that you’re good friends with this good-for-nothing, so I brought him here. Hehe, it seems that you’ve come at the right time!” Wang Haotian laughed.</p><p>“What do you want?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s very simple. Hand over the token you obtained from the tower of a hundred Supremes, and then hand over the woman who obtained Blue Gold venerable’s inheritance to me. Then, I’ll give this trash to you!</p><p>Wang Haotian still had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“He has the token from the tower of a hundred Supremes?”</p><p>On the side, Luan Fengyun’s eyes glowed with greed.</p><p>He also needed the token of the tower of a hundred Supremes.</p><p>“I’ll use the token to exchange with you, but it’s impossible for you to hand over Tingting!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If he handed ruan Tingting over, they would definitely strip ruan Tingting of her soul and turn her into an idiot.</p><p>It was impossible for him to use one person to exchange for another.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
