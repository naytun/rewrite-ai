Two swords formed and slashed at Wang Haotian.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming pounced on Wang Haotian.</p><p>A terrifying devouring power erupted from his left palm and enveloped Wang Haotian. His right palm activated the destructive prison heaven art and struck out.</p><p>With the addition of eight inscription arrays, Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased greatly.</p><p>Wang Haotian’s eyes were filled with shock. With a long howl, the Spear’s radiance turned into an illusion and shattered the two combat swords. Then, he stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>This time, the collision was even more shocking than the previous one. Wang Haotian was forced to retreat.</p><p>Yes, this time, it was Wang Haotian who retreated.</p><p>Gasps could be heard from all around.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually repelled Wang Haotian. It was unbelievable.</p><p>Wang Haotian took six steps back and stood still. He was in disbelief and roared, ” “You, when did you inscribe the inscription formation?”</p><p>He had never expected that not only was Lu Ming’s martial arts cultivation extremely high, but his inscription Dao was also so terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold killing intent was the only response he got. He continued to step forward. Runes appeared on the ground and condensed into a combat sword, which was aimed at Wang Haotian.</p><p>At the same time, he charged toward Wang Haotian.</p><p>Wang Haotian roared and almost turned into a Man on Fire. His spear was thrown forward and collided with Lu Ming’s.</p><p>But the result was that Wang Haotian kept retreating.</p><p>Lu Ming cast eight formations on himself. At the same time, he used the inscription formation and the devouring power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline. He had completely suppressed Wang Haotian.</p><p>Not far away, Luan Fengyun’s expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>Just now, he was still high and mighty, thinking that he could suppress Lu Ming at any time and take ruan Tingting away.</p><p>Now, the truth told him that he was ridiculously wrong.</p><p>Wang Haotian’s combat ability was definitely not weaker than his. If Wang Haotian was suppressed, did that mean that he would be suppressed as well?</p><p>This was hard for him to accept.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and a formation appeared. Eight swords were formed and they slashed at Wang Haotian.</p><p>At the same time, he attacked Wang Haotian with all his might.</p><p>Wang Haotian was in danger.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Wang Haotian let out a long roar. The long spear pierced through the sky. He turned into a beam of light and shot up into the sky, breaking through the attack of the inscription formation and rushing into the sky.</p><p>Wang Haotian retreated in defeat. He rushed into the air to avoid Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Lu Ming could not inscribe inscription arrays in the void yet.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s eyes were filled with killing intent. He could not wait to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>He was actually forced to retreat by Lu Ming and could only run for his life. Under the watchful eyes of the public, this was simply a great humiliation.</p><p>The key was that Lu Ming’s martial arts cultivation was two levels lower than his.</p><p>Wang Haotian rushed into the sky, but Lu Ming had no intention of stopping. He suddenly changed direction and stomped on the ground. Runes appeared and condensed into a long spear, which shot toward Wang Kong like lightning.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of Wang Kong in an instant. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>what?! Wang Kong was shocked. Everything had happened too quickly.</p><p>Wang Haotian fled while Lu Ming turned around to attack him. He did not expect this to happen so quickly.</p><p>He roared in fear and used all his strength to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear condensed by the formation was sent flying by Wang Kong. However, in the next moment, Lu Ming arrived.</p><p>The terrifying devouring power enveloped Wang Kong, causing his blood flow to be disrupted and his combat strength to be weakened. At the same time, Lu Ming’s palm was coming for him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>All of Wang Kong’s defenses were shattered by Lu Ming’s palm. Lu Ming’s palm landed heavily on Wang Kong’s chest. Wang Kong’s eyes popped out of their sockets. His eyes were filled with disbelief and unwillingness.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>ah! a shrill scream came out of Wang Kong’s mouth, and the next moment, his body was torn into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming took another step and his essential core rolled up, wrapping around Jian feiliu’s body. In a flash, he appeared at the entrance of the cave.</p><p>All of this happened in the time it took for a spark to fly off a Flint.</p><p>It was too fast.</p><p>Wang Haotian fled and rushed into the sky. Lu Ming changed his direction and charged toward Wang Kong. He took Jian feiliu and appeared at the entrance of the cave. Everything happened in the span of one or two breaths.</p><p>Many people didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>When Lu Ming appeared at the entrance of the cave, the crowd finally reacted and gasped.</p><p>Wang Kong had been killed. He had been killed instantly.</p><p>Was this Lu Ming’s combat strength? It was too terrifying to use all of his combat strength. A heaven’s favorite like Wang Kong was completely unable to resist.</p><p>“Eh? This kid isn’t completely dead yet!”</p><p>Dandan, who was on Lu Ming’s shoulder, suddenly spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. His eyes were shining as he said,”Dandan, what do you mean by this? What do you mean by not completely dead?”</p><p>on the surface, this brat looks like he’s dead. In fact, he still has a chance of survival. His cultivation was crippled and he used a method to self-destruct his bloodline power. However, he still doesn’t have cultivation and can’t fully control his bloodline power. Therefore, he still has some chance of survival. As long as his bloodline power is restored, maybe he can be revived? ”</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right. Now I’ll inscribe an inscription formation to lock this kid’s chance of survival. The rest will be up to you.”</p><p>After saying that, he flew into the cave with his sword and began to inscribe the formation.</p><p>When he spoke to dandan, it was all through voice transmission, so the others did not hear it.</p><p>“Damn it, Lu Ming! How dare you kill the Wang family’s prodigy? you’re dead!”</p><p>Wang Haotian roared in the sky.</p><p>“If you have the ability, come down and fight me!” Lu Ming glanced at Wang Haotian with disdain.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s face turned pale, then ashen. He didn’t dare to go down.</p><p>Wang Haotian, let’s work together. It’s more important to get supremacy lanjin’s inheritance. In less than a day, the Ditian royal guards will be here!</p><p>Luan Feng Yun said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s join forces!”</p><p>Wang Haotian nodded.</p><p>“Everyone, attack together and kill this man!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun waved his hand.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou also roared.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s hands moved rapidly and countless inscriptions sank into the ground.</p><p>“Attack, don’t give him time to inscribe inscriptions and arrays!”</p><p>Wang Haotian roared and took the lead to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Luan Fengyun moved as well. A large bow appeared in his hands. He drew the bow and nocked an arrow, which he shot at Lu Ming.</p><p>The arrow was like a stream of light, piercing through the void and making a terrifying Sonic Boom.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and arrays appeared one after another. There were offensive and defensive arrays.</p><p>A few ancient shields appeared in front of Lu Ming, but they were easily pierced through and shot straight at the area between Lu Ming’s eyebrows.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear appeared and stabbed forward, colliding with the arrow. Lu Ming felt his arm go numb and he took three steps back.</p><p>The attack power of chaotic wind cloud’s arrows was too strong.</p><p>At the same time, Wang Haotian arrived. Lu Ming kicked out and activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique, exchanging blows with Wang Haotian.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
