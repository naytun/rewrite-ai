Two powerful elders were spurting blood from Lu Ming’s palm. Lu Ming’s combat strength had once again shocked everyone.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s long hair fluttered in the wind. He strolled forward and chased after the two elders.</p><p>“Kid, stop!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s voice rang out. He stood behind Jian feiliu’s junior Sister, and a violent aura enveloped her. “Brat, if you dare to attack again, do you believe that I won’t kill her!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He did not expect Wang Mang to be so despicable that he would use feng ting’s life to threaten him.</p><p>Feng ting was the name of Junior Sister apprentice Jian feiliu.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had stopped, Wang Mang’s expression turned sinister.”Brat, destroy your own cultivation. Otherwise, this b * tch will die now!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Wang Mang, if I’m not mistaken, this woman is your wife, right?” Lu Ming laughed. You’re threatening me with your wife’s life? Did a dog eat your head?”</p><p>“Also, the so-called disciples of the ancient families are like you? I’ve really opened my eyes.”</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect Wang Mang to be so shameless. He actually used his own wife to threaten Lu Ming. Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward with a threatening gaze. if you want to kill her, go ahead. I don’t even know this woman. However, I’m afraid that you, Wang Mang, will have to bear the good name of killing your wife and threatening your enemy in the future!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck out and suppressed everything. The elder brothers spat out large mouthfuls of blood and one of their arms exploded.</p><p>“Dammit! Retreat!”</p><p>Wang Mang grabbed feng ting and quickly retreated.</p><p>The two elders also retreated quickly. Lu Ming didn’t press on. He still had some concerns about feng ting’s life. If Wang Mang really went crazy and killed feng ting, Jian feiliu would probably feel bad.</p><p>“Jian feiliu, you piece of trash. Do you only know how to hide behind others? Don’t worry, when I return, I’ll keep an eye on this b * tch. All of this is because of you!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s angry voice could be heard.</p><p>“Senior brother!”</p><p>Feng ting’s face turned pale and her body trembled.</p><p>“Junior Sister!”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes were red and he clenched his fists but he was helpless.</p><p>“And you, brat, just you wait! How dare you hurt my Wang family’s people? I’ll see how you die!”</p><p>Wang Mang immediately shouted at Lu Ming and left with his men.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. After all, he was an outsider. Just now, he had the ability to make Wang Mang stay, but so what if he stayed? The consequence would be that feng ting’s end would be even more miserable, and even Jian feiliu would be implicated.</p><p>He was not afraid, but he had to consider Jian feiliu and feng ting.</p><p>Jian feiliu looked in the direction that Wang Mang had left in and was in a daze. Then, his body started to tremble.</p><p>“Trash, I’m trash!”</p><p>Jian Fei and Liu Nannan muttered to themselves.</p><p>“Brother Jian!” Lu Ming frowned. Jian feiliu’s condition was not right.</p><p>“Trash, brother Lu, I’m a piece of trash. I can’t even protect the woman I love and can only watch as she’s bullied and humiliated. Tell me, do you think someone like me is worthy of being called a heaven’s favorite? Do you still deserve to live in this world?”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes were listless and he looked dispirited. It was as if he had lost all his fighting spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Jian feiliu was in a dangerous state. His martial arts heart was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. A long spear appeared in his hand. The sharp spear radiance was aimed at Jian feiliu’s glabella.</p><p>Jian Feilu sensed the terrifying killing intent. A golden light shone in his hand and a golden combat sword appeared. He blocked the spear radiance and retreated quickly. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brother Lu, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>“What do you mean? I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>“Kill me? Why do you want to kill me?”</p><p>Jian Fei revealed an expression of disbelief.</p><p>“What’s the use of a trash like you in this world? A small blow and you’re already unable to recover, what’s the point of cultivating martial arts? I might as well send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura was overbearing and his clear voice continued, ” the path of martial arts is full of thorns and difficulties. What we need to do is not to retreat, but to move forward bravely. With our own strength, we can destroy everything. If you want to save your Junior Sister, you have to become stronger, so strong that you can look down on everyone!</p><p>“Do you think a noble King would have the balls? didn’t the ancestors of the ancient families all start off as ordinary people? what does a mere Wang family count for? As long as I’m strong enough, I alone can be an ancient family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was like a great Bell, striking Jian feiliu’s heart and soul continuously, causing Jian feiliu’s body to tremble.</p><p>power, power, yes, as long as I have enough power, I can save Junior Sister. As long as I have power, I can destroy everything!</p><p>Jian feiliu murmured to himself. A trace of light slowly returned to his eyes. Then, he closed his eyes. After a while, he opened his eyes. There seemed to be two golden divine swords piercing the sky.</p><p>A golden combat sword appeared above his head, as if it could break the sky.</p><p>At this moment, Jian feiliu seemed to have realized something and transformed.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you very much for this!”</p><p>Jian feiliu bowed to Lu Ming in gratitude.</p><p>This time, it was really too dangerous. His heart of martial arts almost collapsed. If his heart of martial arts collapsed, his cultivation would no longer be able to advance. He might even be invaded by his heart’s devil and suffer from Qi deviation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were like an epiphany that woke him up. It even caused him to undergo a transformation. He comprehended a martial art technique from his bloodline, an even more powerful bloodline martial art technique.</p><p>He was extremely grateful to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Jian, there’s no need to be so polite. I’m just speaking from the bottom of my heart. Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, the two of them returned to the inn.</p><p>However, the surrounding crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>“Who’s that kid? What big words, you actually look down on the Wang family!”</p><p>not only that, but he also said that he’s from an ancient family. He’s really arrogant and doesn’t know his place!</p><p>just wait and see. The chosen of the Wang clan won’t let him off. Wang Mang is only considered ordinary in the Wang clan!</p><p>The sound of discussion spread and soon, the news of the battle spread.</p><p>……</p><p>The next morning, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and the other twenty-nine experts of the metal sword sect flew westward.</p><p>The Heavenly King tablet was there.</p><p>A hundred miles away, a huge stone tablet rose into the sky. It was a thousand meters tall and hundreds of meters wide.</p><p>There were no words on one side of the stone tablet. It was completely blank, and there were 27 stone steps below it.</p><p>The stone staircase was very large and long. One could see that the top seven steps were dark red, but there was no one on it.</p><p>The 20 stone steps below were gray, the same color as the stone monument. There were many figures on these 20 steps.</p><p>One by one, they sat cross-legged on the steps, as if they were cultivating.</p><p>Moreover, the number of people decreased from the bottom to the top.</p><p>The first step had the most people, and the higher it went, the fewer people there were.</p><p>There was only one figure sitting cross-legged on the 19th step, and no one was on the 20th step.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
