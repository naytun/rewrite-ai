You actually invited three little fellows. Even if you don’t want to fight for a spot, don’t joke around with the lives of the rest. It’s very dangerous to step onto the battle stage. What do you mean by asking three trash to drag us down? ”</p><p>Yubo said in an unfriendly tone.</p><p>“Hey, old man, who are you calling trash? You’re the one who’s a f * cking piece of trash!”</p><p>Kong Jin was furious when he heard Yubo calling them trash.</p><p>“Junior, you still dare to talk back? Let me ask you, why haven’t you come and practice battle formations together? if you’re not trash, then what are you doing if you’re not dragging us down?”</p><p>Yubo berated loudly, taking advantage of his seniority.</p><p>hehe, we don’t practice the battle formation because we don’t need to practice at all. Do you know the main purpose of this battle formation? ”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and said indifferently.</p><p>“The purpose of the battle formation is to increase our combat power and fight against the enemy.” Yubo said.</p><p>“Wrong!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and said, ” the purpose of this battle formation is to strengthen your defense. To put it bluntly, it’s to strengthen your defense so that you can protect yourself. You can leave the matter of fighting the enemy to us.</p><p>Not only were the others stunned, but so were Yubo and Qiao long.</p><p>Qiao long finally understood that Lu Ming’s goal was to get the others to strengthen their defense. He did not expect them to help defeat the enemy at all.</p><p>Even though he had guessed Lu Ming’s identity, he still felt that Lu Ming was too confident.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Yubo laughed even more crazily. ignorant, boastful, and arrogant. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.</p><p>“Fatty, I’m not interested in this kind of trash. I’ll leave him to you. You can finish him in five moves. No problem, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in the air.</p><p>“Five moves? One move is enough!” Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said as he strolled out.</p><p>Yubo’s mouth twitched in anger. What’s wrong with these kids? It was as if he was made of mud. She said five moves and she would take him down in one move. Did she think he was just a decoration?</p><p>“Little girl, get lost!”</p><p>You Bo shouted, and the powerful aura of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier exploded.</p><p>The other people’s expressions changed and they retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yubo reached out his hand and formed a huge claw, grabbing at Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing stretched out a small white hand and pressed forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The terrifying pressure of the sky demon power field suddenly descended, and then the destructive cutting power burst out.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s destruction and wind mentality had already merged successfully. Now that he had broken through to sea of soul realm, the sky demon power field and the destructive cutting power were many times stronger than before.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yubo’s hand, which was formed from true energy and will, exploded. The destructive force hit him and almost cut him in half. He screamed and flew out, coughing up blood. He looked at Xie nianqing in fear.</p><p>Just now, he really felt that he was almost cut in two.</p><p>He didn’t know that Xie nianqing had been merciful just now. Otherwise, he would have been cut in two.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Lu Ming turned around and left.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin left with Lu Ming, leaving behind a bunch of dumbfounded people.</p><p>It was too terrifying. They had already tried their best to overestimate Lu Ming and the rest. In the end, they realized that they had still underestimated them.</p><p>The combat strength of Lu Ming and the others was simply unfathomable. Even youbo, who was at the early stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean realm, was easily defeated. It was a complete crushing.</p><p>They couldn’t help but be filled with anticipation for this competition. Perhaps, they could really charge into the top three?</p><p>Yubo’s face turned green and red. Finally, he waved his hand and said, ” “Sect master Qiao, since you have such a heaven’s favorite, why do you still need me? This time, I’ll back out. I won’t accept any of the treasures you’ve given me!”</p><p>Then, he strode away.</p><p>However, Qiao long had no intention of keeping him.</p><p>If it was before, he would definitely try his best to keep Yubo. After all, he had spent a lot of effort to invite Yubo over, and he was also the only expert at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier from the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>But now, he realized that there was no need.</p><p>Yu Bo’s presence didn’t seem to affect the overall situation much. If Yu Bo left, he could just find a random spiritual ocean tier martial artist to join.</p><p>It was enough as long as Lu Ming and the other two were there.</p><p>……</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The contest for the spots in the hundred venerated mountains had officially begun.</p><p>This time, a total of thirty-six forces around the three cities, including Grand gathering city, were competing, and only the top six would get a spot.</p><p>In first place, there were eight Ming ‘er.</p><p>The second place had six spots.</p><p>The third place had five spots.</p><p>The fourth and fifth place had four spots each, while the sixth place only had three spots.</p><p>There were a total of thirty spots.</p><p>The venue was on a mountain peak at the junction of the three cities. This mountain peak was called juping peak. The top of juping peak was very flat. There was a huge battle stage built on it, and there were many audience seats around it.</p><p>In the past, all the major events in the three major cities would be held on juping peak.</p><p>On this day, juping peak was packed with people.</p><p>The 36 forces were clearly divided and sat around each other.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin sat among the sea Cloud sect’s crowd and looked around.</p><p>Not far away from them, there were people from the wind sword sect, two forces apart.</p><p>the two monsters of the clear river. I don’t know what method the wind sword sect used, but they actually managed to invite the two monsters of the clear river.</p><p>Qiao Xuan looked in the direction of the wind sword sect and said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw that ye fa was sitting at the top of the wind sword sect’s group. Below him were many wind sword sect disciples and elders.</p><p>Among them were two skinny old men in green robes. Their eyes were cold and they would occasionally glance at Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Ye Qing from the wind sword sect was among them. She looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a venomous gaze.</p><p>Tingting, don’t worry. If the wind sword sect meets us this time, we’ll definitely cripple them. It’s impossible for them to get a spot. Also, those two monsters of Qinghe are dead for sure.</p><p>Kong Jin revealed a ferocious smile.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting nodded, her eyes filled with hatred.</p><p>Wind sword sect District.</p><p>“Seniors, the three juniors of the sea Cloud sect can’t be underestimated. Their battle power is very strong. If you encounter them, try to kill them!”</p><p>Ye fa said to the two monsters.</p><p>don’t worry, hehe, that girl is really beautiful, even more beautiful than that girl ruan Tingting. The two of us must get her!</p><p>The boss of the Qinghe twins laughed coldly as he looked at Xie nianqing with a pair of evil eyes.</p><p>“When the time comes, as long as we kill those two brats, that little girl will be yours to play with!”</p><p>Ye fa laughed as a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
