I hate you, and I don’t welcome you now. Get lost, get lost, I don’t want to see you!”</p><p>...</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s face was cold as she asked him to leave.</p><p>“Tingting, what’s wrong? you were fine before. What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>Kong Jin asked.</p><p>“Didn’t you hear me telling you to leave? You’re not welcome here, so leave quickly. Are you going to bully me just because you have a high cultivation level? I’m not afraid!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting called out stubbornly.</p><p>“Tingting, what’s the matter? tell us and I’ll help you solve it!”</p><p>Kong Jin shouted.</p><p>Ruan Tingting gritted her teeth and almost said it, but then she remembered that there were patriarchs at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier in the wind sword sect, as well as several experts at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. If she told Kong Jin and the others, wouldn’t she just implicate them? she gritted her teeth and didn’t say anything, only wanting Kong Jin and the others to leave.</p><p>“Fatty, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked over, pulled the spatial link, and walked out.</p><p>“But … Tingting!”</p><p>Kong Jin wanted to continue.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll talk after we leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled fatty and walked out with Xie nianqing by his side.</p><p>As she watched Lu Ming and the rest leave, ruan Tingting could no longer hold back her tears. They flowed down in streams.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Kong in and left the wind sword sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why did you drag me out? Tingting must be in trouble.”</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>“You think I can’t tell?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If you can tell, why did you bring me out?”</p><p>there must be an inside story behind this. She doesn’t want to say it, perhaps because she’s afraid of implicating us. We can only come out first and think of a solution later.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“What do you have in mind?”</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>“Right now, we need to first know what’s going on before we can solve it. Let’s go to Grand gathering city first. Didn’t we leave behind miss Qiao Xuan’s voice transmission jade talisman? She’s so close to Tingting, so she might know something. Let’s find her first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>perhaps it’s because of the wind sword sect or her family. I’ve seen her cry before! Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Let’s go to Grand gathering city first, I’ll send a message to miss Qiao Xuan!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade voice transmission talisman. At this moment, his eyes flickered.</p><p>“Miss Qiao Xuan sent me a message first, asking us to gather at Grand gathering city!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Kong Jin’s expression changed. He said, ” miss Qiao Xuan must have something to tell us at this time. Let’s go!</p><p>The three of them quickly flew towards Grand gathering city. Not long after, they arrived at Grand gathering city and saw Qiao Xuan at the city gate.</p><p>“Brother Kong, brother Lu, miss Xie, Tingting is in trouble!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said anxiously when she saw Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>what happened? Tingting just kicked us out. Kong Jin hurriedly said.</p><p>Tingting came to look for me just now. She cried the moment she saw me. She didn’t want to tell me at first, but after I asked her again and again, she finally told me that it was because of the hundred venerated mountain …</p><p>Immediately, Qiao Xuan told him everything she knew.</p><p>despicable, despicable and shameless wind sword sect. What sect leader? what elder? they’re simply shameless to the extreme.</p><p>After listening to what he had to say, Kong Jin’s anger rose to the sky like a mad beast.</p><p>“This sect should not remain in this world!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was also extremely cold.</p><p>“Miss Qiao Xuan, you’re guessing that Ting Ting will risk her life to save her parents?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“With Tingting’s personality, that’s very likely to be the case!” Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>not good. If you can guess it, how can the wind sword sect not? if Tingting goes, it might be dangerous. Let’s hurry back to the wind sword sect!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>……</p><p>By the time Qiao Xuan found Lu Ming and the rest, ruan Tingting had already started to move in the wind sword sect. She had changed into a black robe and turned into a Black Phantom in the night, flying towards the depths of the wind sword sect at high speed.</p><p>After passing through many pavilions and palaces, ruan Tingting appeared in a courtyard.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>When ruan Tingting appeared, a voice came from one of the rooms. Then, two figures appeared in the courtyard.</p><p>It was a middle-aged couple.</p><p>“Tingting, it’s you. Why are you here so late at night?” she asked.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Tingting and asked.</p><p>father, mother, come with me. Let’s leave this place and leave the wind sword sect. Ruan Tingting’s eyes were red.</p><p>“Tingting, what happened?”</p><p>The middle-aged couple was even more confused.</p><p>“Father, mother, they want me to marry the two monsters of Mount Qinghe. They even need you to threaten me …”</p><p>Ruan Tingting briefly explained the situation.</p><p>“What? How could such a thing happen? our ruan clan has been devoted to the wind sword sect, but they’re still treating you like this. No, I must find the sect leader and ask him.”</p><p>The middle-aged man said angrily.</p><p>father, it’s no use. They’re very determined. In their eyes, it’s only right for them to use my happiness to help their children. Let’s go!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>This was also the reason why she came here personally and didn’t send a message to her parents. She was afraid that after her father received the news, he would directly look for ye fa, and by then, she wouldn’t be able to leave even if she wanted to.</p><p>yeah, listen to Tingting. There’s no need to stay in such a sect!</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s mother said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father said through gritted teeth.</p><p>The three of them carefully left the courtyard and headed out of the sect. They bypassed many courtyards and left the core area of the wind sword sect. The terrain became wider, but the three of them stopped.</p><p>In front, Ye Qing and su Luo stood in front and sneered. Behind them, a group of people followed.</p><p>ruan Tingting, How dare you! You actually want to betray the wind sword sect with your parents and ignore the rise and fall of the wind sword sect. You’ve committed a heinous crime.</p><p>Ye Qing sneered with a smug smile on her face.</p><p>Ye Qing, just admit that you’re despicable and shameless. Don’t use those reasons to pressure me. You’re only doing this for yourself. Even if I die, I won’t let you have your way.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s face was very pale. She knew that she would not be able to leave today.</p><p>“Impudent, you b * tch, what’s your status? How dare you speak to me like this? men, take down those two old men and cripple their cultivation. I’ll see if that cheap woman will obey or not!”</p><p>Ye Qing shrieked.</p><p>A few figures walked out from behind her.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father shouted as his aura burst out from his body and he rushed out.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s father also had the cultivation of a peak-tier King.</p><p>At the same time, ruan Tingting and her mother also rushed forward.</p><p>Today, he would only have a chance if he killed his way out.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s mother, who was a Lv 9 martial King, and ruan Tingting joined forces to defeat the two men.</p><p>“You still dare to fight back? let’s attack together!”</p><p>Sullo waved his hand.</p><p>Immediately, the people behind them all made their moves. There were more than ten of them.</p><p>Three of them were peak-tier Kings, while the others were late-stage Kings.</p><p>With so many experts, ruan Tingting’s group of three couldn’t rush out at once.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
