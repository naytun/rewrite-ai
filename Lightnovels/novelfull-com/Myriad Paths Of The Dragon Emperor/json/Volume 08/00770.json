The other sects looked at the sea Cloud sect with a hint of solemnity.</p><p>He didn’t care about the others in the sea Cloud sect, but it would be troublesome if there was an empty one.</p><p>The competition continued. Lu Ming sat in the stands and focused on refining the blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence of three martial artists at the third level of the spiritual sea realm was too rich. This was the first time Lu Ming had devoured such a rich and powerful blood essence.</p><p>He had used all the power of his blood essence to improve his second bloodline.</p><p>He planned to upgrade the prison suppressing stele bloodline to the divine level first. That way, the power of the prison suppressing heaven technique would increase greatly, and then, he would upgrade the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>The strong power of blood essence kept flowing into the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Time passed very quickly. Not long after, the first round of the competition was over, and the top 18 had been determined.</p><p>Those who won were happy because they were one step closer to the top six.</p><p>Those who failed would be dejected and lose such a great opportunity.</p><p>The ruling Guild allowed the various major powers to rest for an hour before proceeding with the second round.</p><p>The second round was still arranged by the referee.</p><p>The judge seemed to have done it on purpose. The most powerful forces were not arranged together in the beginning. Instead, they were arranged to be separated. This was the only way to appear fair.</p><p>If those powerful forces met at the beginning, then there would be forces that could strive for the top six. It would be a little unfair if they were eliminated early.</p><p>The second round of the competition continued.</p><p>There were a total of nine battles for the 18 forces.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect was scheduled for the seventh round. At this time, the blood essence in Lu Ming’s body was almost fully refined.</p><p>Although the blood essence of three martial artists at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm was rich, it was impossible for the prison suppressing stele bloodline to advance to the divine level. It could only reach the ninth level of the king tier. If it wanted to break through to the divine level, it was unknown how much blood essence it would require.</p><p>In this match, the sea Cloud sect’s opponent was the blue waves sect. This power had an expert at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier as its leader, as well as several other experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>As soon as the competition began, the other side formed a battle formation, with defense as the priority.</p><p>On the sea Cloud sect’s side, Kong Jin launched a storm of attacks while the others only assisted him in his attacks. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not make any moves and followed behind the crowd.</p><p>This was their plan. First of all, they only needed to make a move.</p><p>Their target was the stronger forces. It wasn’t their turn to make a move yet.</p><p>In this battle, under Kong Jin’s storm-like attacks, the opponent’s battle formation was finally destroyed. That peak third level spiritual ocean tier martial artist was heavily injured and almost chopped off by Kong Jin’s axe. Fortunately, they admitted defeat in time.</p><p>Just like that, the sea Cloud sect had already locked onto the top nine.</p><p>The last two matches ended quickly, and the top nine were all out.</p><p>Intentionless mansion, Sea Cloud sect, Red Moon sect, wind sword sect, Shi family …</p><p>In the process of entering the top nine, the most shocking one was still the wind sword sect.</p><p>The wind sword sect didn’t just have the two monsters of Qinghe River. An elder of the wind sword sect had also erupted in this battle, revealing his cultivation at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, shocking everyone.</p><p>The wind sword sect actually had two experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and everyone thought that they had the highest chance of entering the top three, or even the top two.</p><p>Without a doubt, the intentionless mansion was considered the strongest.</p><p>After entering the top nine, they would take turns to fight each other. Each force would have to fight against the other eight forces, and their ranking would be determined by their battle results.</p><p>The order of the battle would be decided by drawing lots.</p><p>The first battle was between intentionless mansion and the Shi family.</p><p>The Shi family was Shi Kai’s family. They were also very powerful and had a patriarch at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier as their leader. However, this battle was against intentionless mansion, so there was no suspense at all. Before they even started the competition, the Shi family had already admitted defeat.</p><p>This was the ranking battle, not the elimination battle, so of course he had to admit defeat.</p><p>Otherwise, if they lost a few experts, how could they compete in the future?</p><p>Therefore, when they encountered an opponent like intentionless mansion that they could not defeat, it was the wisest decision to admit defeat.</p><p>No one would look down on the Shi family.</p><p>In the second Battle, the wind sword sect took the stage. His opponent also admitted defeat.</p><p>Intentionless mansion and wind sword sect had easily won.</p><p>As long as they won three consecutive matches and entered the top six, there would be no problem.</p><p>The entire wind sword sect revealed a smile. Even ye FA’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>Only one person’s expression was even more ferocious, and that was Ye Qing.</p><p>Her cultivation had been crippled. No matter how good the wind sword sect’s results were, no matter how many spots they had, she would not have a share. Hence, her hatred for ruan Tingting and Lu Ming grew even stronger.</p><p>The competition was carried out one match after another.</p><p>“Sea Cloud sect versus Red Moon sect!”</p><p>The judge’s voice spread far and wide.</p><p>In the first round of the ranking battle, they had actually encountered the red moon sect.</p><p>“Qiao long, your winning streak ends here!”</p><p>The sect leader of the red moon sect looked at Qiao long coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? Don’t end up like that pile of bones just now, in such a sorry state!”</p><p>Qiao long sneered in response and looked at the sect leader of the iron bone sect.</p><p>The iron bone sect’s sect leader was so angry that his teeth were itching. With just a single sentence from him, Qiao long had pulled him in again, causing him and the others to be depressed.</p><p>“Doesn’t your Sea Cloud sect rely on that fatty? As long as we send someone to hold him back, the others will be able to easily defeat the rest of the sea Cloud sect. Then, we’ll join forces to deal with that fatty. It’ll be easy to win!”</p><p>The sect leader of the red moon sect smiled faintly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Qiao long responded coldly and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>On the fighting ring, Lu Ming and the rest stood opposite the people from the Crimson Moon sect.</p><p>fatty, the Crimson Moon sect will definitely send out that expert at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier to hold you back. Then, the others will come and defeat us, and then join forces to deal with you. Later on, you can’t appear too strong. Our target is the wind sword sect. If you display too much strength, the wind sword sect will directly admit defeat when they meet us later. That would be troublesome.</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Kong Jin.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry. I’ll defeat my opponent with ‘difficulty’ later.”</p><p>Kong Jin grinned and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled faintly.</p><p>This time, their target was the wind sword sect.</p><p>If the wind sword sect wanted to enter the top six, they would have to be extremely lucky and only encounter them later on. If they had encountered them earlier, the wind sword sect would not be able to enter the top six.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>In the red moon sect, Six-Fingered cultivator shouted and his body flashed as fast as lightning, pouncing toward Kong Jin.</p><p>The other eight people from the Crimson Moon sect quickly pounced on Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The strength of the red moon sect was very strong. Apart from Six-Fingered cultivator, who was at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, they also had an expert at the peak of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier. There were also some other experts, and their overall strength was not weak.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>The eight of them had set up a large array. Light flashed and a light screen enveloped them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Kong Jin and Six-Fingered cultivator were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The others from the Crimson Moon sect had also arrived.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The experts of the Crimson Moon sect attacked them with all kinds of attacks. However, their battle formation was the inheritance that Lu Ming had obtained from Lian Cang. It was extremely exquisite.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing had unleashed some of their strength and combined it with the battle formation to block the attack of the red moon sect.</p><p>As for Kong Jin, he also suppressed his strength on purpose and fought to a draw with Six-Fingered cultivator.</p><p>For a time, the two sides were in a stalemate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
