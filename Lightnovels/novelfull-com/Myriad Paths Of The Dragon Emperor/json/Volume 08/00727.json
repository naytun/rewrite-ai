He endured the pain and left with Qin Qingshan.</p><p>He came with an overbearing aura and left in a sorry state.</p><p>Looking at the shocked gazes around him, Lu Ming was extremely calm.</p><p>Defeating Qin Qingshan was not a big deal. In his heart, he had long since stopped treating Qin Qingshan as an opponent. The opponents in his heart were those King tiers who were ranked at the top of the list of top 1000 talents, and even those ten Heavenly Kings who had rushed into the top 600 with their King tier cultivation, and were on par with many sea of soul realm heaven’s favorites.</p><p>That was his true opponent.</p><p>He turned around and strolled back.</p><p>“Brother Jian, let’s go in and continue drinking!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, but Jian feiliu did not respond. He was slightly stunned and looked at Jian feiliu.</p><p>Jian feiliu was looking in a direction with a blank look.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Jian feiliu’s gaze and saw a few figures.</p><p>One of them was a tall young man in a red scaled armor, and the other was a young woman who was extremely beautiful.</p><p>Behind the two of them were two elders.</p><p>Jian feiliu just fixed his eyes on the girl. However, the girl just lowered her head as if she dared not raise her head.</p><p>Pa! “Pa!”</p><p>The young man in the scale armor clapped his hands and strolled toward Lu Ming and the rest. He smiled and said,”I didn’t expect to meet such an expert here. Not bad, not bad. Isn’t this brother Jian?”</p><p>“Wang Mang!”</p><p>Jian feiliu looked at the young man and said in a low voice.</p><p>“Haha, Jian feiliu, what’s the matter? You’re also here to participate in the Heavenly King ranking battle? With your cultivation, be careful not to die Here.”</p><p>The corners of Wang Mang’s mouth curled up slightly, revealing a hint of mockery.</p><p>“You don’t need to care if I’m alive or dead, do you? Brother Lu, let’s go!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said as he turned around to leave.</p><p>“Haha, Jian feiliu, why don’t you greet your Junior Sister apprentice?”</p><p>Wang Mang laughed heartily. His strong arms wrapped around the beautiful woman beside him. The woman’s body trembled, but she didn’t dare to resist.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s body trembled slightly and he clenched his fists.</p><p>haha, Jian feiliu, I told you that as long as I like your Junior Sister, she will be mine. Now, she has become my wife. Speaking of which, your Junior sister’s body and skin are really comfortable.</p><p>Wang Mang laughed heartily.</p><p>The woman’s body trembled, but she lowered her head and didn’t make a sound.</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>Jian feiliu clenched his fists tightly. His eyes were red and his teeth were clenched.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If you want to hit me, then why aren’t you attacking? You’re really useless!”</p><p>Wang Mang shouted coldly.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s breathing became heavy.</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s eyes turned cold and a powerful aura emanated from their bodies.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Xie, let’s go!”</p><p>Jian feiliu said. His voice was hoarse and it seemed to be filled with endless anger.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He felt that the situation seemed to be very complicated.</p><p>He didn’t understand the situation and it was indeed inconvenient for him to make a move.</p><p>Jian feiliu took another look at the woman, then turned around and strode away.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing, then turned to leave.</p><p>“You’re really a piece of trash!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s disdainful voice could be heard from behind.</p><p>The three of them didn’t return to the restaurant, but went straight to the inn.</p><p>On the way, Jian feiliu didn’t make a sound. His eyes were red and his fists were clenched.</p><p>After returning to the inn, Jian feiliu opened his mouth.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Xie, aren’t you curious why I didn’t make a move just now?”</p><p>Jian feiliu said.</p><p>Wang Mang. I remember that the person ranked 700th on the list of top 1000 talents is called Wang Mang. Could it be him? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Jian feiliu nodded and said, ” that’s him. But I didn’t do anything. It’s not because he’s ranked higher than me. It’s because he’s an ancient family. He’s the direct descendant of the Wang family!</p><p>“Wang clan? The Wang family, one of the six great ancient families?” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Jian feiliu nodded and then sighed, ” the strength of the six great ancient clans is too terrifying. I’m not afraid, but I have to think for the golden sword sect. Furthermore, I have to think for my junior!</p><p>“Are the six great ancient families really that powerful?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course it’s powerful. Lu Ming, I think you should learn more. Don’t you know some common knowledge? ”</p><p>Xie nianqing rolled his eyes at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose in embarrassment.</p><p>miss Xie is right. The six great ancient aristocratic families have astonishing strength. Back then, when Martial Emperor Di Yi founded the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, there were a total of nine great aristocratic families. They followed Martial Emperor Di Yi to conquer the world. These nine great aristocratic families were called the nine great ancient aristocratic families.</p><p>each ancient family has an amazing inheritance and talent. Later, each family was given a divine level cultivation technique by Martial Emperor Di Yi as a family protection cultivation technique. Since then, the nine ancient families have become more powerful. As time passed, three of them disappeared, and there are only six left.</p><p>these six ancient families can be said to be the most powerful forces in the Emperor heaven divine Palace. They are all located in ninedragons of the sky martial region. Their strength is not something that those sub-palaces in the major regions can compare with. The difference is too great.</p><p>Jian feiliu explained.</p><p>he actually has a God-grade cultivation technique? ” Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>that’s right. It’s said that the ancient clans ‘deity-tier cultivation techniques complement their bloodlines, and their power is extremely terrifying. For example, my golden sword sect can be said to be extremely powerful in the golden light region. We can cover the sky with one hand and have peak stage spirit embryo experts. However, compared to the ancient clans, we’re still far too inferior. Every ancient clan has many powerful spiritual God Realm existences.</p><p>Jian feiliu sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. That was indeed the case. An ancient family like that could annihilate the golden sword sect with just one spiritual God Realm powerhouse.</p><p>“What’s with that woman?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>Jian feiliu didn’t answer. He seemed to be lost in thought.</p><p>“If brother Jian doesn’t want to answer, then forget it.” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“AI! “It’s nothing much. That woman was originally my Junior Sister, and we were childhood sweethearts. Once, when we went out to train, we met Wang Mang. Wang Mang took a fancy to my Junior Sister at first sight, and later sent someone from the Wang family to the golden sword sect to propose marriage. The Wang family is a behemoth, so some of the elders in the golden sword sect were naturally willing to marry her. What’s laughable is that my Junior Sister was also willing, hehe!”</p><p>After Jian feiliu finished, he laughed at himself.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s gazes flickered, but they did not say anything else.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s words were simple, but the two could roughly guess it.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of Lu Yao. Back then, didn’t lu Yao do the same? In order to climb up to a stronger power, she had abandoned him.</p><p>Such things did not only happen to Lu Ming. In this world of martial arts where the strong preyed on the weak, such things happened everywhere.</p><p>there’s no need to be too afraid. When the battle for karmic luck begins, there are rules everywhere. When the younger generation fights, the older generation is usually not allowed to interfere. Even if we kill that Wang Mang, the elders of the Wang family are not allowed to interfere.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
