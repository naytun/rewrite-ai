His combat strength is extremely terrifying.</p><p>the nine Serenities corpse transformation art can turn one’s body into a divine corpse. One’s entire body will be impervious to blades, Spears, water, and fire. There’s nothing that can’t be destroyed. It’s terrifying to the extreme. This is a terrifying opponent!</p><p>Many people were talking about it. Some of the Warriors who were going to participate in the battle of the Heavenly Kings list secretly noted down the corpse King so that they could be more careful when they met him in the future.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taixu’s expression was extremely ugly. He glanced at the four people on the 20th step and his killing intent flashed. Then, he turned around, walked down the steps, and left.</p><p>“Beautiful lady, how may I address you? I’m free advance!”</p><p>Fatty took a few bites of the leg of lamb before turning his small eyes to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s answer was only one word.</p><p>“Beauty, why are you so fierce? Didn’t he just want to exchange some pointers? Don’t tell me you’re already taken? Am I late again? Brother, are you really you?”</p><p>The fatty sighed and then looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you want to fight me?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Duel? what duel? I have my principles when it comes to picking up girls. First, I don’t pick up girls who are already taken. I won’t fight with others for someone who’s already taken. How tiring would that be?”</p><p>pretty lady, do you have any brothers or sisters? no, sisters? introduce one to me. fatty turned to Xie nianqing as he munched on the leg of lamb.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianqing uttered another word.</p><p>“Look at you, can’t you speak properly? Brother, does your wife have a sister? can you introduce one to her?”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This fatty was really a weirdo. Did he come online to find someone to introduce a girlfriend to him?</p><p>Xie nianjun’s figure appeared in Lu Ming’s mind. He said subconsciously, ” “She really does have an older sister who looks quite like her!”</p><p>“What? Really? Brother, you have to help me. I’ve already decided, I’m going to conquer this beautiful sister.”</p><p>Fatty’s eyes were shining, and then he took another bite of the Lamb leg.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes were fierce as he squeezed out two words.</p><p>“I’m going to start my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly sat cross-legged and closed his eyes, ignoring the outside world.</p><p>Xie nianqing gritted his teeth and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>The fat man gnawed on the leg of lamb with a swish. Then, he carried the axe, sat cross-legged, and began to cultivate.</p><p>The corpse King also began to cultivate.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming caught a trace of the earth concept’s trajectory and began to comprehend it.</p><p>His comprehension of the earth essence realm had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed. Lu Ming had finally cultivated the earth concept to the full circle of level one.</p><p>Now, there were four concepts.</p><p>The earth and fire concepts were both at the completion of level one, while the wind and thunder concepts had both reached the beginning of level two.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased tremendously compared to when he had first arrived.</p><p>At this time, the battle for the Heavenly King ranking had officially begun.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and everyone else who was cultivating on the Heavenly King’s tablet descended the steps and headed north.</p><p>There was a huge square dozens of miles away. The square was paved with a kind of black stone with complicated inscriptions on it.</p><p>There were more than 100000 peak-tier Kings gathered around the square.</p><p>The fat man followed Lu Ming like a shadow, mumbling non-stop that he wanted to introduce Xie nianqing’s sister to him.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely regretful now. He regretted the words that he had blurted out previously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying pressure came from the sky, and six figures appeared.</p><p>These six people were definitely extremely powerful experts. It was very likely that they were all in the spirit embryo realm. Three people from the Empyrean Heavenly Divine Palace and three people from the heavenly corpse sect. Both sides would send experts to preside over the battle for the Heavenly King ranking.</p><p>“Venerable three corpses, let’s begin! Do you want to announce it, or should I?”</p><p>In the Emperor heaven divine Palace, a middle-aged man with a Jade crown on his head looked at the man in the middle of the three people from the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>“Hehe, Dongfang Hao, you’ll do it!”</p><p>Venerable three corpses chuckled and said no more.</p><p>Dongfang Hao nodded and looked around. the battle of the Heavenly Kings ranking requires two rounds of preliminaries to select the strongest group of people to qualify for the final battle. The first round of preliminaries will be held in this square.</p><p>With that, Dongfang Hao waved his hands, and runes entered the ground. The runes glowed, and the next moment, shields appeared in the square.</p><p>The shields were arranged in rows. In each row, there were thirty-six shields in front of and behind them, making a total of eighteen rows.</p><p>you should have seen that there are thirty-six shields in each row. Go up the stage and hit these shields. Only those who can break through nine shields will pass and enter the next round. Now, let’s begin!</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p><p>“I’ll do it, I’ll do it!”</p><p>“I’ll join you too!”</p><p>Immediately, 18 people stepped onto the square.</p><p>There were a total of eighteen rows, and eighteen people could take the test at the same time.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>True Qi circulated, and all kinds of wills bloomed. The eighteen people attacked one after another.</p><p>Those shields were shattered piece by piece.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a burly man punching out with both his fists continuously. Beams of scorching fist radiance were blasted out and the shield was constantly broken. However, the moment the shield was broken, it seemed to produce a powerful force that retaliated against his body.</p><p>The further back they went, the harder it seemed to break the shield, and the stronger the power of the counterattack.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The brawny man kept retreating. In the end, he roared and punched with all his might, shattering the shield of the ninth fastest man.</p><p>But at the same time, his body was also pushed back and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>nine pieces, pass. You, six pieces, fail, eliminated!</p><p>…..</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p><p>Out of the eighteen people who went up, only six of them managed to shatter nine pieces. Those who passed only had a success rate of one-third.</p><p>The tallest one had broken eleven shields.</p><p>“Next group!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p><p>Immediately, another 18 people flew up, and the broken shields were re-formed.</p><p>that’s Jiang Taixu! Jiang Taixu is going up!</p><p>Among the eighteen people, one person attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was a genius from the Jiang family, one of the six great ancient aristocratic families. He was ranked sixth in the last generation of the ten Heavenly Kings. Now, the top four of the ten Heavenly Kings had all entered the sea of soul realm. Jiang Taixu was the most likely candidate to compete for the strongest King this time.</p><p>Jiang Taixu stood still like a mountain. A terrifying sharpness emanated from his body, as if it could cut through everything.</p><p>The Jiang family, one of the six ancient families, cultivated the immemorial divine weapon technique, which was a God-level cultivation technique that could cultivate one’s body into a divine weapon. Their body was a divine weapon that could break and destroy everything, somewhat similar to the nine nethers corpse transformation technique of the heavenly corpse sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
