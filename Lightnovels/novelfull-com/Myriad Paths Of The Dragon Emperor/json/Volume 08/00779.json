Lu Ming did not even use the prison-suppressing heaven technique or the earth concept and he was already completely suppressed.</p><p>...</p><p>you’re acting like you’re the number one in the world with your little combat power. You’re really shameless. I’m not playing with you anymore!</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and took a step forward. He approached Miao Yi at lightning speed and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art.</p><p>As soon as he struck out with his palm, Miao Yi’s expression changed drastically, because he felt a terrifying pressure.</p><p>This pressure made him feel apprehensive.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>He quickly put away his centipede weapon, which then formed a circle in front of him like a shield.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm hit the shield of the centipede weapon.</p><p>The shield formed by the centipede weapon was instantly shattered. Miao Yi’s body trembled violently and he coughed out a large mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying backward like a cannonball.</p><p>“Brat, I won’t let you off!”</p><p>Miao Yi bellowed in anger, and turned into a green light, flying off into the distance. He had actually escaped just like that.</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes but he did not pursue.</p><p>Miao Yi was, after all, the son of the Miao family’s patriarch. Although it was not appropriate for the Miao family’s elders to interfere in the young people’s conflicts before the battle of Providence, no one could say for sure if the Miao family’s patriarch would go crazy if Miao Yi was really killed.</p><p>However, if Miao Yi did not know when to retreat, Lu Ming did not mind finding an opportunity to get rid of him.</p><p>At this moment, the other dozen or so people looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Miao Yi, who was ranked 501st on the list of top 1000 talents. Could Lu Ming be in the top 500?</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold as he swept his gaze across the dozen of people.</p><p>Among them, the young man who said that he wanted to see how Lu Ming would cry turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of the young man.</p><p>“You said you want to see how I cry? How was it? Does it look good?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>“That … This brother, I was blind. I didn’t know you were so powerful, haha!”</p><p>The young man broke out in a cold sweat as he spoke incoherently.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>The young man’s expression turned unsightly, but he didn’t dare to refute in the slightest and obediently flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to land on the stone pillar and began to comprehend.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming got up and left the place.</p><p>He had already stayed here for seven days. That was enough. He needed to find the next imprint.</p><p>Only by corroborating multiple imprints with each other could inspiration be inspired and collide with more brilliant sparks.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming appeared in another place. It was a small valley with another mark.</p><p>This mark contained the concept of fire.</p><p>Lu Ming comprehended it quietly.</p><p>At this moment, two groups of people were looking for Lu Ming in the hundred venerated mountain.</p><p>On one side was Shangguan jinjue. He was leading a few young experts from the Shangguan family in search of Lu Ming.</p><p>Those young experts were all at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Although they weren’t prodigies, being able to cultivate to this realm under the age of thirty wasn’t simple either. Their battle prowess was considered high among those of the same level.</p><p>On the other side was Miao Yi. After he returned to the Miao family, he also gathered a few experts and entered the hundred venerated mountains to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about this. He stayed in the small valley for three days before he got up and left.</p><p>He found a secret place and entered the Supreme shrine.</p><p>&Nbsp; after comprehending Wind and Fire intent in this period of time, he was now going to use intent crystals to increase his cultivation speed.</p><p>He sat cross-legged next to the path-understanding ancient tree, crushed a wind-element intent crystal, and started cultivating.</p><p>Right now, he still had more than ten middle-grade wind attribute intent crystals.</p><p>As he crushed one after another, Lu Ming’s intent of wind was improving rapidly. Now that Lu Ming’s intent had reached the second level, the speed at which he consumed the profound meaning crystals had greatly increased. In less than a day, more than ten wind-type profound meaning crystals had been consumed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming used low-grade profound meaning crystals to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming consumed the low-grade profound meaning crystals even faster. He used dozens of them and shattered them.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had used up more than ten thousand low-grade profound meaning crystals. His wind concept had finally reached the peak of level two beginner. He was only one step away from level two lower tier.</p><p>However, he was stuck at this step. He had reached a bottleneck. This wasn’t something that could be broken through with intent crystals. He could only rely on himself to comprehend it.</p><p>Putting aside the concept of wind for now, Lu Ming took out the fire-type esoteric crystal and started cultivating.</p><p>Three days later, the middle-grade fire attribute profound meaning crystals were all used up. At the same time, he used up a large number of low-grade profound meaning crystals. Lu Ming had also raised his fire concept to the peak of the second level beginning stage. At this point, he had also encountered a bottleneck.</p><p>“Let’s go out and look for the imprint to comprehend!”</p><p>After that, Lu Ming left the Supreme shrine and searched for a suitable mark in the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming would refine earth attribute esoteric crystals whenever he had time. He would find a suitable imprint and comprehend it on the spot.</p><p>Every few days, his position would change.</p><p>The hundred venerates mountain was filled with mountains and peaks. It wasn’t easy to find a single person. Shangguan jinjue and Miao Yi had been looking for him, but to no avail.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>A month had passed since Lu Ming arrived at the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>At this time, there was still one year and two months until the battle of Providence.</p><p>“Such dense spiritual energy!”</p><p>Looking at the pool in front of him, Lu Ming was a little shocked.</p><p>He searched for the mark left by the venerable one in a barren mountain. He passed through a secret crack in a cliff and saw a pool that was completely condensed by spiritual Qi.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the pool had turned into liquid. Lu Ming felt that the spiritual energy in the pool could be compared to that of high-grade spiritual crystals.</p><p>“I can cultivate here and break through to the second level of the spiritual ocean realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>In this period of time, although his Wind and Fire intents were still at the peak of the beginning second level, his earth intent had also reached the peak of the beginning second level through cultivating with earth-element intent crystals.</p><p>Only the Thunder concept was a little slower, and it had also reached the late-stage of level two beginning.</p><p>Now, breaking through to the second level of the spiritual ocean tier was not the slightest bit of a problem.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Lu Ming leaped into the pool, and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. He opened his mouth and inhaled, and the extremely rich spirit Qi of heaven and earth continuously gushed toward the nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had exploded countless spiritual crystals to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique and refined it with all his might, converting it into essential core.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>In the spirit ocean, the Zhen Yuan was like waves, constantly rolling. As the spirit Qi continued to transform into Zhen Yuan, the Zhen Yuan continued to grow.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming had devoured and refined all the spiritual energy in the entire pool.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sound of raging waves crashing against the shore came from his dantian, rumbling and exploding.</p><p>Waves of terrifying aura emanated from Lu Ming’s body. After a while, he opened his eyes.</p><p>“Second level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>intent is still in the middle tier. As long as I can reach the second level lower tier in all four types of intent, and have enough spiritual crystals or orirocks, I can charge into the third level of the spiritual ocean realm in one go, or even the fourth level!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, got up, and left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
