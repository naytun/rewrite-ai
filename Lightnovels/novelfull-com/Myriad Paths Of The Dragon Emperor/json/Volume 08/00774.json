A terrifying destructive force burst out.</p><p>...</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The people of intentionless mansion activated the battle formation. Battle sabers were formed one after another, negating the invisible destructive cutting power.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and Kong Jin flashed into the sky demon power field.</p><p>“Try my axe, the Mad demon battleaxe!”</p><p>Kong Jin stepped on the fighting stage, and the fighting stage rumbled. With every step he took, his body swelled up a little. The battle axe in his hand, which was as big as a door, twisted the air into a ball and smashed toward intentionless mansion like a storm.</p><p>The earth concept and shattering concept were integrated into the bloodline martial skill. The terrifying power and the power to destroy everything made the people of intentionless mansion change their expressions.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used the prison-suppressing heavenly art and struck out at the intentionless mansion.</p><p>In comparison, Lu Ming’s palm was much more restrained. It looked very ordinary, as if it was just an ordinary palm. However, the faces of the people from intentionless mansion were even uglier.</p><p>This was because they could feel that the pressure from Lu Ming’s palm was even stronger than Kong Jin’s.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The elegant old man shouted. The nine of them activated the battle formation and combined their auras into one. They each sent out two rays of saber radiance, which were aimed at Lu Ming and Kong Jin.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, Lu Ming and Kong Jin stood still, while the nine people from intentionless mansion staggered backward. Even the battle formation was almost destroyed.</p><p>They were enveloped by Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field and were suppressed. It was difficult for them to exert their full combat strength.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Kong Jin stepped forward and launched another attack. This time, the power of this attack was stronger than the previous one.</p><p>“The hand of the heavenly Devil!”</p><p>This time, Xie nianqing also attacked. A beautiful arm pressed towards the people of intentionless mansion.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The entire battle stage was shaking. The nine people from intentionless mansion were thrown into disarray by the violent power and retreated one after another. The four peak third level spiritual ocean tier martial artists ‘faces turned pale and they spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Haha, amazing, truly amazing. We admit defeat!”</p><p>The elegant old man took a deep breath and calmed his surging qi and blood. He cupped his fists and said, but his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>The nine of them had joined forces to set up a formation, but they were still no match for Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>The combat strength of these three young men was terrifying.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and smiled.</p><p>“The sea Cloud sect wins this battle!” The judge announced.</p><p>Immediately, cheers came from the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Many people were so excited that their faces turned red.</p><p>Hu! “Hu!”</p><p>At the scene, the people from the other forces all let out a breath, as if they were trying to calm down their turbulent emotions.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect had actually defeated the intentionless mansion.</p><p>This was something that he had never expected before the competition.</p><p>At the very beginning, when the sea Cloud sect’s people went up, everyone saw that there were actually three first level spiritual ocean tier youths. No one thought highly of the sea Cloud sect, thinking that they were just going through the motions.</p><p>Even if a few people thought that the sea Cloud sect might have invited a heaven’s favorite, what would happen?</p><p>However, they would never have thought that the sea Cloud sect would be able to defeat the intentionless mansion.</p><p>After all, it was impossible for Ordinary Geniuses to defeat an expert at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>However, in the end, the sea Cloud sect became the dark horse and defeated the intentionless mansion. Without a doubt, the sea Cloud sect was in first place this time.</p><p>according to the results, the top six have been decided. They are the sea Cloud sect in first place, with eight spots!</p><p>The judge announced.</p><p>Waves of cheers came from the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Qiao Long’s face was filled with excitement.</p><p>Out of the eight spots, four were given to Lu Ming. There were four left. He would never have dared to think about this before.</p><p>The other powers all looked at the sea Cloud sect and Qiao long with envy.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect’s luck was too good. They had actually obtained the help of such a heaven’s favorite. Why didn’t they have this luck?</p><p>“Second place, intentionless mansion, six spots.”</p><p>……</p><p>The judge announced the top six.</p><p>sixth place, Red Moon sect. Sixth place, three spots for the hundred venerate mountains. Alright, this competition is over. In the next two days, list out the spots to enter the hundred venerate mountains. In two days, someone will go to the sea Cloud sect to get it.</p><p>After the announcement of the verdict, he looked at Lu Ming, Kong Jin, and Xie nianqing before leaving.</p><p>With the judge’s departure, the competition had come to an end. The sea Cloud sect had become the biggest winner.</p><p>The 36 forces dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had also returned to the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>The top six forces all sent people to the sea Cloud sect to wait for the messenger.</p><p>One day, a young man wearing a starry robe arrived at the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>Qiao long and the people from the other six factions came out to welcome them.</p><p>“Have you prepared the list of the people who will enter the hundred venerated mountains? Give it to me!”</p><p>The young man had his hands behind his back and an air of superiority.</p><p>Qiao long and the others didn’t dare to delay and quickly handed in their respective name lists.</p><p>They could tell that the young man was a disciple of the Shangguan family just by looking at his clothes.</p><p>The Shangguan family was one of the most powerful families on the Dragon’s Vein, apart from the Wang family. It was also one of the most powerful forces in ninedragons, apart from the six ancient families.</p><p>Compared to small forces like them, they were many times stronger.</p><p>The young man put away the name list and glanced at it. He nodded and waved his hand, sending eight tokens to Qiao long. “These are the eight tokens to enter the hundred venerated mountains, keep them!”</p><p>Qiao long happily put it away.</p><p>Then, the young man passed the corresponding token to intentionless mansion and the other forces.</p><p>as long as you’re under 30 years old and have the mountain entrance token, you can enter the hundred venerated mountains at any time!</p><p>After saying that, the young man stepped into the air and left.</p><p>After the young man left, Qiao long went to Lu Ming and the others ‘residence and handed the four tokens to them.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, when do you plan to enter the hundred venerated mountains? Should I let Xuan ‘er and the others go with you guys?”</p><p>Qiao long asked.</p><p>“Tomorrow!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiao long nodded and left.</p><p>……</p><p>After the young man from the Shangguan family issued the tokens, he flew toward the Dragon vein.</p><p>this time, there’s a name called Lu Ming on the list. Interesting. Could it be Lu Ming from the Heavenly King List? ”</p><p>The young man muttered.</p><p>‘I heard from uncle wuchen that cousin Xingchen has an enemy in the Tianxuan region. His name is Lu Ming. I wonder if they are the same person. Should I tell uncle wuchen about this? Hmm, I should go and tell them. If it’s the same person, I might be blamed for not mentioning it even if I know the situation in the future.”</p><p>With this thought in mind, the young man flew in the direction of the Shangguan family.</p><p>The Wang family occupied the core of the Dragon vein, but the Shangguan family also occupied a very good territory, which was one of the most precious places.</p><p>One after another, majestic mountain peaks rose from the ground. They were lush and verdant, and the spirit Qi was so dense that it was like fog floating in the sky. It was like a paradise.</p><p>Many palaces were located on the mountain peak.</p><p>In the courtyard of one of the palaces, two figures were sitting.</p><p>They were Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
