He ended his seclusion and continued to look for the marks to comprehend the concepts.</p><p>...</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming sat cross-legged beside a huge stone ax, quietly comprehending.</p><p>The intent realm that this stone axe emitted was the earth intent realm.</p><p>There were not many people who could comprehend the earth essence realm now. There were only five people around the stone axe, including Lu Ming.</p><p>……</p><p>The position of the dragon’s head was the center of the Dragon’s Vein. The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was so dense that it had even turned into fog, floating between heaven and earth.</p><p>There was even the will of heaven and earth permeating the area. It was obvious that there was a Dao eye in the Dragon vein. It was very easy to comprehend the will of heaven and earth here.</p><p>The Wang family, one of the six great ancient families, was located here.</p><p>In one of the Wang family’s courtyards, Wang Kong stood beside a slender young man who was wearing a cloud pattern. There was no trace of arrogance on his face. Instead, there was respect and fear.</p><p>“Wang Kong, you’re saying that Lu Ming might have obtained a token that leads to a higher cultivation sanctuary?”</p><p>The young man spoke. His voice was not loud, but it was filled with dignity.</p><p>brother vast heaven, that’s right. Lu Ming made it to the ninth level and stayed there for six days. It’s highly possible that he has obtained a token.</p><p>Wang Kong answered honestly.</p><p>“Oh, that’s very likely. I must get that token and use it to enter the blood pool to form my third bloodline! Wang Kong, go get it for me!”</p><p>The young man’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The young man’s name was Wang Haotian, ranked 356th on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>Although his ranking was only a few dozen places higher than Wang Kong’s, they were not even on the same level.</p><p>The top 300 were known as God-level prodigies. Wang Haotian was in the top 400, close to the top 300. He was a quasi-God prodigy who was about to awaken his third bloodline.</p><p>Once the third bloodline was awakened, and it was a divine bloodline, one would be a divine-level genius.</p><p>It was a pity that Wang Haotian didn’t get the token to go to a higher Holy Land when he reached the ninth floor of the tower of a hundred talents.</p><p>Wang Kong knew that Wang Haotian wanted to get the token and go to a higher cultivation Holy Land, the blood pool. He wanted to accumulate the power of his bloodline and condense a divine bloodline.</p><p>Therefore, when he knew that Lu Ming might have a token, he must get it.</p><p>“Brother Haotian, that Lu Ming is extremely powerful. I couldn’t take him down in the last battle!” Wang Kong’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>hehe, I see. No wonder you’ve come to find me. It’s fine. You just have to say my name, and I don’t think he’ll dare to refuse. Go!</p><p>Wang Haotian waved his hand.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Wang Kong nodded and left.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming stood by the stone axe. He spent five days in comprehension. Lu Ming had gained a lot. He felt that the earth concept could break through to level two lower tier at any time.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly turned his head and looked in one direction.</p><p>A young man walked over.</p><p>Wang Kong!</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve finally found you!”</p><p>Wang Kong coldly said.</p><p>“What’s wrong? A defeated opponent is looking for a beating again?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Hearing this, the other four people around the stone axe were shocked. Did Wang Kong really lose to this young man?</p><p>Wang Kong’s face darkened as the wound was mended. I’m not the one looking for you this time. You’ve heard of Wang Haotian, right? ”</p><p>Wang Haotian, a quasi-God prodigy, ranked 356th? ” Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>that’s right. He asked me to come and take your token. Hand over the token!</p><p>Wang Kong coldly said, his tone filled with threat.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?” Wang Kong’s face darkened.</p><p>“I’m laughing at your Wang family. As one of the six great ancient families, it’s simply a disgrace. You don’t have the ability to get it, so you want to get it from others without putting in any effort. Who was Wang Haotian? If he wants it, tell him to come and get it himself!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, his tone full of disdain.</p><p>“How dare you, Lu Ming! You dare to insult the Wang family? no one can save you!”</p><p>Wang Kong roared.</p><p>“Why don’t we try?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were as sharp as a blade. He exuded a powerful aura and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth rumbled, and a powerful aura emanated from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Wang Kong’s expression changed. He quickly retreated and shouted, ” “Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>With that, he quickly left.</p><p>“You cowards!” Lu Ming shook his head and continued to sit cross-legged beside the stone ax.</p><p>However, just as he sat down, Lu Ming’s expression changed. A voice transmission jade talisman appeared in his hand. He scanned it with his mind and his expression changed slightly.</p><p>It was Qiao Xuan who had sent him the message. She seemed to be in a hurry and was looking for Lu Ming. She wanted to meet him somewhere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed slightly. He stopped cultivating and flew toward the address that Qiao Xuan had left behind.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming saw Qiao Xuan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, fatty and Tingting are in trouble!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said anxiously when she saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“What? What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Immediately, Qiao Xuan explained everything she knew.</p><p>It turned out that after entering the hundred venerated mountains, Kong Jin had been cultivating with ruan Tingting. Everyone knew what fatty was thinking.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that some time ago, ruan Tingting had obtained a great opportunity. She had actually obtained the inheritance of a peerless master from an imprint. That inheritance was actually a God-grade cultivation technique.</p><p>Many people were shocked by this.</p><p>The prodigies of the Luan family, one of the six great ancient families, were nearby. They immediately forced ruan Tingting to hand over the divine-grade cultivation technique. Ruan Tingting naturally refused to hand it over, and then the Luan family made their move.</p><p>This time, Kong Jin had defeated The Prodigy of the Luan family in the beginning. However, the Luan family had sent out even more people. Kong Jin was no match for them, so he had to escape with ruan Tingting. Now, they were trapped in a cave.</p><p>“Tingting and fatty didn’t send us any news. They must be afraid of implicating us. I only heard about it because this matter is getting bigger and bigger. Right now, fatty and the others are in danger, so I thought of you.”</p><p>Qiao Xuan said.</p><p>“Chaos, damn it!”</p><p>There was a sharp glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The Luan family and the Wang family were really jackals of the same lair. They thought that they were high and mighty and that they could take other people’s things as they pleased.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve also heard that Tingting’s legacy is deeply engraved in the soul and can’t be passed on to outsiders. Once it’s passed on, the soul will explode and the person will die!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiao Xuan said anxiously.</p><p>“Do you know where fatty and the others are trapped? Bring me there!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a cold light.</p><p>“It’s at a place with a mark. It’s quite a distance from here. Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiao Xuan rose into the air and disappeared.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The fat man walked forward, gasping for air. His entire body was covered in blood. It was all his own blood.</p><p>He held his battle axe and blocked the entrance of a cave. Ruan Tingting was in the cave.</p><p>The walls of the cave had been marked by a peerless expert, which made the rocks of the cave extremely hard and indestructible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
