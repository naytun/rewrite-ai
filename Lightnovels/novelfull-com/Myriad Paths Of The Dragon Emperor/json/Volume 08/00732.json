This time, the battle of the Heavenly King ranking is an early confrontation for some peerless geniuses in the battle of Providence. It will be extremely fierce. We must be prepared.</p><p>...</p><p>Some of the older generation sighed.</p><p>kid, you’ve got some skills. Let’s see how strong you are.</p><p>Wang mie was forced to retreat by Lu Ming. He felt embarrassed. The killing intent in his eyes grew colder and the aura on his body grew stronger.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not back down and his fighting spirit grew stronger.</p><p>Suddenly, a vast and boundless aura spread down from the top of everyone’s heads.</p><p>An old man appeared in the air and said, ” no fighting is allowed in front of the Heavenly King tablet. Anyone who violates this rule will be killed without mercy!</p><p>His voice was so loud that it shocked everyone.</p><p>This old man’s aura was too terrifying, making it impossible for one to even think about resisting. He was definitely not an ordinary sea of soul realm expert. Perhaps, he was a top expert of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Every time the Heavenly King stele was opened, the Empyrean divine Palace and the heavenly corpse sect would send out experts to manage the stele together.</p><p>It was obvious that this old man was the master in charge of the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>Lu Ming and Wang mie quickly retracted their auras and disappeared.</p><p>kid, you’ve made it this time. However, you won’t be so lucky when the battle for the Heavenly King List begins.</p><p>Wang mie’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Oh, really? I will see you at the battle of the Heavenly King board!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Wang mie coldly snorted and turned to leave.</p><p>At this moment, on the steps of the Heavenly King monument, people were continuously being blasted down.</p><p>“I’m going to break through my limits and enter the spirit sea!”</p><p>With a loud roar, a white-haired old man on the 10th step took a step up to the 11th step.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A large hole suddenly appeared in the old man’s chest. With a scream, his body was blown down the stairs like a kite with a broken string. He fell to the ground and no longer had any breath.</p><p>it’s your old man. Sigh, his life is coming to an end. He wanted to give it a try, but he still died in the end!</p><p>Someone recognized the old man and sighed.</p><p>“What can I do if I don’t fight? Rather than dying from the exhaustion of his lifespan, it’s better to take a risk!”</p><p>A similarly white-haired old man firmly said.</p><p>The number of people on the stairs was getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>At this moment, a new person went up.</p><p>For example, Gao Qiang, Qin Qingshan, Qin qingfei, and the others.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were about a hundred people who stepped onto the first step.</p><p>As soon as everyone stepped on it, some people’s expressions changed drastically, and their bodies trembled, but they gritted their teeth and barely held on, while some people’s expressions remained calm.</p><p>For example, Gao Qiang and Qin Qingshan had very calm expressions.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>With a shrill cry, Qin qingfei was blasted down the first step and fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>“Haha, who is this person? He was blown down the first step!”</p><p>The surrounding crowd burst into laughter.</p><p>Normally, those who came here were all peak-tier King tiers and could be considered experts. It was very rare for one to be blasted down from the first step. Their willpower was simply too weak.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen?”</p><p>Qin qingfei’s face was red with shame.</p><p>Out of more than a hundred people, he was the only one who had been blasted down the first step.</p><p>As for the others, some of them sat cross-legged on the first step, while others continued to walk up.</p><p>After that, at every step, there would be people who would stop and sit down cross-legged. There were also people who were thrown down the steps.</p><p>Generally speaking, as long as one didn’t force himself, there wouldn’t be any danger to his life. At most, he would be injured.</p><p>Only a small number of people kept going up.</p><p>Gao Qiang and Qin Qingshan, who were close to each other on the list of top 1000 talents, seemed to be competing with each other. They didn’t stop and kept moving up.</p><p>Soon, the two of them reached the tenth step.</p><p>After climbing up the 10th step, the two of them stopped and looked up with a hint of fear in their eyes.</p><p>But the next moment, the two of them continued to move upwards.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The moment Gao Qiang stepped on it, it was as if he was struck by lightning. His body trembled and he spurted out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His body couldn’t help but retreat back to the 10th step. He roared and stood firm on the 10th step.</p><p>As for Qin Qingshan, he didn’t retreat. Although his body was trembling, he still stood firmly on the 11th step.</p><p>Gao Qiang’s eyes were filled with unwillingness. In the end, he was still no match for Qin Qingshan.</p><p>After Qin Qingshan had stabilized himself on the 11th step, he took another step.</p><p>On the 12th step.</p><p>When he stood on the 12th step, his body trembled non-stop and his face was pale. After a long time, he slowly stabilized himself and sat cross-legged on the 12th step to cultivate.</p><p>“Let’s go up too!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with curiosity. He stepped forward, followed by Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and the others.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also saw Wang mie, Wang Mang, and the three gray-robed men from the heavenly corpse sect. They had all come forward together, and there were more than a hundred of them.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the first step.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stepped on it, he felt a strong pressure on his body and even on his heart.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the same time, a huge, menacing demonic beast pounced on Lu Ming, its demonic aura enveloping him. Its bloody mouth bit at Lu Ming’s neck as if it could snap it in half in the next moment.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He stood still like a mountain, allowing the demonic beasts to charge at him.</p><p>When the demonic beast hit his body, it disappeared.</p><p>An illusion, it was indeed an illusion!</p><p>However, the cold and merciless killing intent and the violent fiendish Qi were real.</p><p>Moreover, the most terrifying thing about this illusion was that if one’s will wasn’t strong enough, the illusion would become real and deal a heavy blow.</p><p>This was also why some people couldn’t resist it and were seriously injured or even died.</p><p>The demonic beast on the first step wasn’t too strong, so very few people would be blasted down.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming stepped onto the second step.</p><p>The pressure on his body and soul grew stronger. At the same time, a ferocious demonic beast pounced at him.</p><p>This demonic beast’s eyes were cold and emotionless, and the killing intent it gave off was even stronger than the previous one.</p><p>However, Lu Ming ignored it and allowed the demonic beast to charge past him.</p><p>He continued to step forward, the third step, the fourth step …</p><p>On the side, Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu also stepped forward without stopping.</p><p>On the other side, Wang Mang, Wang mie, and the three gray-robed men from the heavenly corpse sect were also in the same state.</p><p>Starting from the fourth step, the demonic beast’s killing intent and demonic aura were stronger. It even carried the will of heaven and earth. This way, the pressure it gave people was even more terrifying.</p><p>The further they went, the more demonic beasts there were, and the impact they gave people became more and more real.</p><p>There were already many people who couldn’t bear it. They either stopped or were blasted down.</p><p>it’s amazing. The essence realm of heaven and earth carried by these demonic beasts seems to be left by a top master. If I can capture them, I will definitely gain something and deepen my understanding of the essence realm of heaven and earth, or even break through!</p><p>however, this place is still not strong enough. I need stronger pressure and a stronger will of heaven and earth. Perhaps it can help me break through the bottleneck and cultivate my will of heaven and earth to level two!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart, his eyes bright.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
