How’s the investigation going? Is he still in the Tianxuan region?”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling asked.</p><p>Shangguan wuchen shook his head and said, ” I’ve done my investigation. Lu Ming has left the Tianxuan region a long time ago. I don’t know where he went. However, I’m sure that his relationship with Yan kuangtu isn’t that deep. Yan kuangtu stayed in the Tianxuan region for two days before he left.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, that little b * stard. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t have suffered such humiliation and even been humiliated by Yan kuangtu in public.</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling’s face revealed a malevolent expression.</p><p>little sister, let’s forget about the matter with Yan kuangtu. He is one of the Supreme commanders of the Ditian royal guards. Even our patriarch would not dare to offend him!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>“Second brother, I know that. But we can’t let Lu Ming off.”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling said coldly.</p><p>“You don’t have to worry about that. Lu Ming is quite talented. He won’t miss the battle of Providence. He might come to ninedragons. Once he’s there, he’ll be at our mercy.”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen took a sip of tea, a cold smile on his face.</p><p>As the two of them were talking, a young man walked in. This young man was the one who had gone to the sea Cloud sect to issue the hundred venerated mountain entrance token.</p><p>The young man was called Shangguan Jinhui.</p><p>“Jin Hui, you’re not working as a Ditian Imperial Guard. How do you have the time to return to the Shangguan clan?”</p><p>Shangguan wuchen stood up and smiled when he saw the young man.</p><p>“Uncle wuchen and aunt Wuling are here as well. It just so happens that I have something to discuss with you two, so I decided to come back.”</p><p>Shangguan Jin Hui said.</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?” Shangguan Wu Chen was a little curious.</p><p>I heard that cousin Xingchen has an enemy in the Tianxuan region. His name is Lu Ming, right? ” Shangguan Jin Hui said.</p><p>“Jin Hui, do you have news of Lu Ming?” Shangguan Wu Ling’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Shangguan Jinhui nodded. I went to the periphery of the Dragon vein this time to give out the hundred venerated mountain entrance tokens to a few small forces. Lu Ming’s name was on one of the forces ‘nominations, so I wanted to come and say something!</p><p>“Could it be someone with the same name?” Shangguan wuchen said.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Shangguan Jin Hui shook his head.</p><p>He was only in charge of giving out tokens and did not know anything else. As for the situation of the competition, he naturally did not know anything.</p><p>“Second brother, I’m planning to go and take a look. What if it’s that little bastard? Hmph, you still want to enter the hundred venerated mountains? dream on!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>“I’ve delivered my message, farewell!”</p><p>Shangguan Jinhui cupped his fists and left.</p><p>“Mm, then let’s go take a look! If it’s that little bastard, just cripple him!” Shangguan Wu Chen also said coldly.</p><p>……</p><p>The next morning, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, ruan Tingting, the four young men from Sea Cloud sect, and Qiao Xuan were all there. A group of eight people flew toward the Dragon vein.</p><p>The entrance of the hundred venerated mountains was right above the Dragon vein.</p><p>The word ” Supreme ” in the hundred venerated mountain referred to the spiritual God Realm Masters. The Masters of the spiritual God Realm were also called supremacies.</p><p>It was said that not only was the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth extremely rich in the hundred venerated mountains, but there were also more than 100 spiritual God Realm powerhouses who had left their own cultivation marks there. There were even spiritual God powerhouses who had left their own inheritances there.</p><p>In history, there were some peerless powerhouses who, when they were alive, did not find a suitable successor. They would leave their inheritance behind through some special means in the hope that there would be a suitable successor in the future to inherit their legacy.</p><p>Therefore, in the hundred venerated mountains, not only could one use the marks left behind by spiritual God Realm Masters to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth, but one could also obtain the inheritance of spiritual God Realm Masters.</p><p>Some powerful spiritual God Realm powerhouses had even mastered God-level cultivation techniques and martial techniques, which was very tempting.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of eight flew forward at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>In the distance, one could see an extremely majestic and vast mountain range lying on the ground.</p><p>This mountain range was the Dragon’s Vein, and one couldn’t see the end of it. It was too big and majestic.</p><p>“Such dense spiritual Qi of heaven and earth!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in admiration. The spiritual Qi of heaven and earth on the Dragon vein was even denser. It was several times denser than in the area of the Grand gathering city. Moreover, he could sense the intent realm of heaven and earth more clearly.</p><p>The environment was too good. Cultivating in such an environment, it would be difficult for one’s cultivation not to improve.</p><p>They flew into the dragon vein and headed towards the entrance of the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>Soon, they came to a huge platform. In front of the platform, there was a huge light door, which was the entrance to the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>In front of the light door, there were experts guarding.</p><p>“Little bastard, is it really you?”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming and the rest landed on the platform, a shrill scream was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and could not help being stunned.</p><p>He saw Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling. At this time, Shangguan Wu Ling was staring at him with a ferocious face.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He did not expect to meet people from the Shangguan family here.</p><p>little bastard, you’re really amazing. You’re in ninedragons, and you’ve even managed to get a place to enter the hundred venerated mountain!</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling stepped forward.</p><p>At the same time, Shangguan Wu Chen also stepped forward. Beside them, there was a tall young man.</p><p>They stood in front of Lu Ming and the rest, blocking their way.</p><p>“Move, you’re blocking the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Get out of the way? Little bastard, do you know what’s in front of you? That’s the hundred venerated mountains, the Holy Land for cultivation in ninedragons. What is your status? What right does a kid who came from a barren mountain in the Tianxuan region have to enter the hundred venerated mountain? now, hand over your entrance token and get out of here!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling said coldly.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had injured the Holy star in public and caused Yan kuangtu to slap her in public. She had regarded it as a great humiliation, and even after such a long time, she still hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>In addition, she did not dare to provoke Yan kuangtu. She could only blame everything on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, who is this crazy woman? There must be something wrong with his brain!”</p><p>Kong Jin said unhappily.</p><p>he’s just a Mad Dog. Let’s go!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and walked to the side, wanting to bypass Shangguan Wu Ling and the rest.</p><p>“Little bastard, what did you just say? You dare to scold me? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Shangguan Wu Ling screamed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen took a step forward and stood in front of Lu Ming and the others. A powerful aura burst out.</p><p>“Second level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could clearly sense Shangguan Wu Chen’s cultivation. The corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>The second level of the spiritual ocean tier, he could suppress it with a flip of his hand.</p><p>“I advise you to get out of the way!” Lu Ming looked at Shangguan wuchen indifferently.</p><p>little bastard, how dare you insult me! Today, none of you can leave!</p><p>Shangguan Wulin’s face was twisted with rage as he swept his gaze across Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest. He then screeched, I didn’t expect you to have a few pretty girls with you. That’s good. These girls will all come back with me. It’s your good fortune to be Xingchen’s concubines!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
