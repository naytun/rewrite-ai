This move could only tie with Wang Haotian.</p><p>...</p><p>The two of them trembled and took a step back.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, Luan Fengyun’s arrows arrived again. This time, he shot out Seven Arrows in a row, and the power was terrifying!</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Taiyou, Luan Tianhao, and the others had also arrived.</p><p>The Jiang family, the Luan family, and Wang Haotian-a total of eight geniuses, plus a dozen fifth level spiritual ocean tier experts-all charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>Kong Jin roared.</p><p>“Fatty, guard the entrance of the cave, don’t come out!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. The cave was filled with injured people. If the fatty came out and the others entered, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Fatty roared. His heart was filled with anger, but he also understood that he could only wait.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and a few huge creatures appeared in front of him.</p><p>There were two giant snake puppets and a cheetah puppet.</p><p>The three puppets were all equivalent to the fifth level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>In the underground world, after annihilating the yin snake tribe, they had seized a large number of puppets. Lu Ming asked Chi jinkong for some puppets to bring along in case he needed them.</p><p>He could finally use it now.</p><p>The two giant snake puppets charged at Jiang Taiyou and the others fearlessly.</p><p>Puppets were impervious to weapons and possessed immense strength. They were the best defensive tools.</p><p>The cheetah puppet, on the other hand, soared into the sky and charged towards the arrows shot out by Luan Fengyun.</p><p>Thump! Thump …</p><p>A series of explosions rang out. It was equivalent to the cheetah puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier being hit by Seven Arrows, and it exploded.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming’s mental energy fire was so huge. An ordinary inscriber would have to use almost all of their strength to control a puppet of the same level, but Lu Ming was perfect at every stage and had lit ten mental energy lamps. How vast was his mental energy fire?</p><p>Not only could he control puppets above his level, but he could also control several at the same time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming, on the other hand, exerted all his strength and sent Wang Haotian flying with a single palm.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Lu Ming’s hands danced wildly once again, and inscriptions were buried into the ground.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>High in the sky, Luan Fengyun bellowed, his killing intent surging like a tide as arrows rained down.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and another puppet appeared. It flew into the sky and exploded under the arrows.</p><p>He, on the other hand, made the best use of his time to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>On the other side, the two giant snake puppets exploded under the attacks of Jiang Taiyou and the rest. However, Lu Ming waved his hand and a few more puppets appeared, charging towards Jiang Taiyou and the rest.</p><p>At this moment, Wang Haotian arrived.</p><p>The more they fought, the more shocked Wang Haotian was. His desire to kill Lu Ming grew stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to stop inscribing inscriptions and fight with Wang Haotian.</p><p>The true essence explosion inscription he had inscribed on his body couldn’t last for long. If the effect of the inscription array wore off, he would be even more passive.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Another arrow was shot down from the sky. This time, the arrow curved and dodged the puppet, aiming for Lu Ming.</p><p>“You want to stop me with a mere puppet? In your dreams!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun’s eyes were like lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength, but the combination of Luan Fengyun and Wang Haotian was too powerful. Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>What he feared the most were Luan Fengyun’s arrows. They were impossible to guard against and had terrifying offensive power. They could take lives from a hundred miles away.</p><p>If it had only been Luan Fengyun, he would naturally have been able to avoid him, draw closer to Him, and defeat him.</p><p>However, there was another Wang Haotian.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s current state, even with the help of the inscription formation, he could barely suppress Wang Haotian. He could not completely suppress Wang Haotian and was in a passive position.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>Kong Jin bellowed. He stood at the entrance of the cave and the battle axe in his hand flew out. It danced in the air and helped Lu Ming block Luan Fengyun’s arrows.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The battle-axe blocked a few arrows from Luan Fengyun and flew back. Then, fatty threw the battle-axe again. This time, it was aimed at Wang Haotian.</p><p>Wang Haotian’s punch sent the axe flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a powerful force field covered a radius of several hundred meters.</p><p>Xie nianqing was also standing at the entrance of the cave, behind fatty.</p><p>Although Xie nianqing’s face was still a little pale, his injuries had basically stabilized.</p><p>“Destruction cut!”</p><p>In Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field, Luan Fengyun’s arrows were blocked by layers of obstacles. Their power was greatly reduced, and it was much easier to defend.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou and the rest were also suppressed by the demonic force field. Lu Ming’s pressure was reduced.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m here to help you!”</p><p>Dandan flew out and stood on Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>“How is it, brother Jian?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ve temporarily sealed their vitality with an inscription formation. The rest is up to you!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>After saying that, dandan retracted her limbs into the turtle shell and flew forward. An arrow hit dandan’s turtle shell and sparks flew, but the arrow was also knocked off course by dandan.</p><p>Dandan flew back to Lu Ming’s shoulder and shouted, ” “You want to shoot through this Lord’s invincible defense? little brat, you’re still 108000 miles away!”</p><p>The killing intent in Luan Fengyun’s eyes intensified. He shot out nine arrows one after another, one after the other. They connected and formed a straight line, instantly crossing thousands of meters in the air. They pierced through the obstruction of the demonic energy field and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Watch me!”</p><p>Dandan flew out and used the turtle shell to block the arrow.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Dandan was shot away, but the continuous arrows were deflected.</p><p>With a scream, a youth at the fifth level of the spiritual ocean realm from the Luan family was shot through by an arrow and died on the spot.</p><p>haha, like I said, you’re far from being able to break my defense, little kid!</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged a blow with Wang Haotian and continued to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taiyou and the others had already rushed over.</p><p>Lu Ming had already lost more than ten powerful puppets.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming no longer had any puppets.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and a formation appeared. It formed sabers, giant swords, long Spears, and so on, attacking Jiang Taiyou and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to inscribe the array.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming, fatty, and Xie nianqing worked together to carve inscriptions as they fought.</p><p>It lasted for more than ten minutes.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and the last inscription sank into the ground. Lu Ming was elated.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As Lu Ming took a heavy step, dense inscriptions appeared on the ground. Then, a light curtain rose and enveloped Lu Ming and the others. In the light curtain, endless sword Qi condensed and attacked Jiang Taiyou and the others.</p><p>not good! This is a peak grade level 6 killing array!</p><p>Jiang Taiyou and the others roared in horror and retreated frantically.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Within the formation, sword Qi crisscrossed, and in an instant, a few fifth level spiritual ocean tier youths were killed.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou, Luan Tianhao, and the others desperately rushed out of the area covered by the formation.</p><p>In the sky, chaotic wind and cloud shot out arrows continuously, but they were all destroyed by the dense sword Qi in the formation.</p><p>It was a top-tier level-six formation, the sword howling Thunder formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
