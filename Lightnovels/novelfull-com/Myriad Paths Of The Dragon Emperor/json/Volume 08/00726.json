If it wasn’t for Yan kuangtu’s appearance, he might not have been able to return to the Tianxuan region and make it in time for Mu Lan’s wedding with the sacred constellation.</p><p>...</p><p>Originally, since this matter was already in the past, Lu Ming did not have the time to go to the Hong domain to find trouble with Qin qingfei and the others.</p><p>However, he did not expect that the two of them would take the initiative to jump in front of Lu Ming and make a fuss. Lu Ming naturally had to settle the score.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming step out, Qin qingfei’s expression changed drastically. He could not help but take a step back. Back then, Lu Ming could compete with Qin Qingshan, but he was not.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m your opponent!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan took a step forward, his aura erupting as he stood face to face with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we didn’t have a clear winner in the battle back then. Let’s see who’s better today!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s eyes revealed a strong desire to fight.</p><p>“It’s really lively today!”</p><p>The people around them watched excitedly.</p><p>At this moment, someone had recognized Qin Qingshan. Naturally, the interest of the surrounding people was high.</p><p>Today, Gao Qiang, the last heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents, Jian feiliu, and now, Qin Qingshan, the other one, appeared.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s ranking was one rank higher than Gao Qiang’s.</p><p>hehe, looks like I don’t need to make a move. I want to see just how much this kid is worth, to dare to speak such arrogant words!</p><p>Gao Qiang sneered in his heart.</p><p>make your move. Use all your strength. I’ll give you two chances!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>It was obvious that Lu Ming would only give him two chances to make a move. He would have no more chances to make a move after that.</p><p>Self-confidence and arrogance!</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan shouted coldly as the aura on his body exploded.</p><p>This aura was extremely cold and seemed to be able to freeze everything. Many ice crystals appeared in the air and even the air itself was frozen.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s body became transparent, and even his hair turned snow-white.</p><p>Qin Qingshan seemed to have turned into an Ice Man, his aura growing stronger and stronger.</p><p>This was Qin Qingshan’s bloodline secret skill. Facing Lu Ming, he did not dare to be careless. As soon as he made his move, he used his ultimate skill.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! Qin Qingshan shouted and slashed out a vast blade light. The blade light broke the sky and was extremely cold as it slashed toward Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>The aura he revealed was much stronger than Gao Qiang’s.</p><p>Many people’s pupils shrank. Qin Qingshan’s combat strength was extremely strong. He had made great progress in the past few years. With his current combat strength, he might not only be ranked at the 999th place.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming stood still in the void. Just as the saber ray was about to land, Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>A dazzling fist radiance pierced through the void and collided with the saber radiance. With a loud bang, the saber radiance was shattered.</p><p>“Not bad, you’ve improved a little, but is that all? It’s too far off!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly, his tone calm as if he had just done something insignificant.</p><p>Qin Qingshan’s pupils contracted sharply. There was disbelief in his eyes. Lu Ming had actually broken through his attack so easily. How could he be so strong?</p><p>“Take another move!”</p><p>Qin Qingshan let out a long howl. His eyes turned snow-white, and his true essence burst out crazily. The cold air around him kept shrinking.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Qin Qingshan became one with his blade, turning into a blade of ice. It was as if there was only a blade light left in the world.</p><p>“So strong, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The surrounding people quickly retreated to avoid being hurt by the wanton cold blade light.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still stood calmly in the air. When the saber ray approached him, he still threw a punch.</p><p>When the fist light was released, the saber Light was shattered!</p><p>Qin Qingshan retreated in disbelief.</p><p>“Qin Qingshan, although you’re much stronger than Gao Qiang, you’re still far from him!”</p><p>A faint voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, a vast spear light burst out from Lu Ming’s hand and smashed toward Qin Qingshan.</p><p>This Spear’s light was unstoppable. It had completely locked onto Qin Qingshan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if Qin Qingshan had been hit by a divine mountain. He was blasted to the ground, creating a huge pit on the street below.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the experts below who acted in time to protect them, half of the city would have been razed to the ground.</p><p>Qin Qingshan had been defeated.</p><p>He had been defeated so thoroughly and so easily.</p><p>Before he started, Lu Ming told him to show off his strength and that he only had two chances. Previously, some people thought that Lu Ming was too arrogant, but the facts proved that Lu Ming was telling the truth. Once he made a move, Qin Qingshan would not have the chance to make a move.</p><p>Many people around them were guessing who Lu Ming was. He was so powerful that even Qin Qingshan, who was on the list of top 1000 talents, was unable to fight back.</p><p>there are too many new talents. Those who ranked below 900th in the last list are in danger. There’s a high chance that they’ll be squeezed out of the list, especially the last few.</p><p>not to mention the 900th place, even the 800th place might be squeezed out if they don’t improve quickly.</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were discussing in shock.</p><p>Gao Qiang looked at Lu Ming, dumbfounded, his face pale.</p><p>Earlier, he actually wanted to teach Lu Ming a lesson. With his strength, was he not courting death?</p><p>When he thought of this, his heart trembled.</p><p>“Perverts, they’re all perverts!”</p><p>Gao Qiang roared helplessly in his heart. He was too unlucky today. In his big domain, he was invincible among the younger generation, which made his self-confidence extremely inflated. He was even brooding over the fact that he was ranked last on the list of top 1000 talents. He thought that with his talent, he could at least be ranked in the top hundreds.</p><p>But today, reality had given him a heavy blow.</p><p>Any random young man on the list of top 1000 talents would be more powerful than him. At this moment, he was dejected.</p><p>Qin qingfei, who was standing at the side, was also dumbfounded.</p><p>In his mind, his big brother had always been powerful and invincible. However, he was as weak as a baby in Lu Ming’s hands. How was this possible? Seven to eight months ago, Lu Ming was still suppressed by his brother. How did he become so powerful now?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure moved and appeared in front of him. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Argh, what do you want?”</p><p>Qin Qingshan screamed in fear.</p><p>“It’s very simple. I’ll take one of your arms and we’ll be even!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Qin qingfei shrieked and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Don’t hurt young master qingfei!”</p><p>The elder behind Qin qingfei bellowed. His essential core burst out and a terrifying attack poured down on Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>This old man was also a peak-tier King, but his battle-power was extremely strong. He was definitely an old man who had cultivated for more than 500 years. He had come to participate in the Heavenly King ranking battle.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even look at him. He kicked out and the power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps exploded, instantly crushing all of the elder’s attacks. The elder screamed in pain and his body flew far away, coughing up blood.</p><p>The crowd was even more shocked. Lu Ming was too strong. That old man’s combat strength was definitely not weaker than Qin Qingshan’s. But in front of Lu Ming, he was like a little chick without the ability to resist. The difference was too great.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers were like a sword, slashing out. A scream was heard and one of Qin qingfei’s arms flew out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
