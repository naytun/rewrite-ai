His palm was like a sword, and he slashed forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In an instant, nine shields exploded, but that was not all. The 10th, 11th, and 12th shields exploded.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, 18 shields exploded.</p><p>“Break again!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted, and the sharpness in his eyes grew. He struck out with his palm again. This time, everyone seemed to see a saber slashing forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One shield after another exploded. The strong wind and Qi were counterattacked, but Jiang Taixu’s figure remained unmoved.</p><p>He continued to attack, shattering everything.</p><p>In the end, a total of 28 shields were broken.</p><p>Jiang Taixu had broken twenty-eight of the thirty-six pieces, which was an amazing achievement.</p><p>In the king’s realm, no one had ever been able to break all thirty-six shields.</p><p>Apart from Jiang Taixu, the strongest among the 18 people in this round had only broken 12 shields. The gap was too great.</p><p>Following that, 18 people in a round, 18 people in a round, people continued to go up.</p><p>However, the success rate was only about one-third.</p><p>Many people who had failed shook their heads and sighed. They had no fate with the Heavenly King ranking competition this time.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Gao Qiang, the last-ranked genius on the list of top 1000 talents, had lost an arm and his combat strength had been weakened. In the end, he had only broken 12 shields.</p><p>Qin Qingshan had shattered sixteen pieces.</p><p>Wang Mang had shattered twenty pieces.</p><p>Wang mie was very strong. He had broken 24 pieces, only four pieces away from Jiang Taixu.</p><p>However, the further one advanced, the tougher the shield became. It was too difficult to break it. Even a single piece was a huge difference.</p><p>A day later, more than half of the 100000 people had been turned.</p><p>Among them, there were a few shocking powerhouses that attracted Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>Those people had broken 28 shields, just like Jiang Taixu.</p><p>From the others, Lu Ming knew that these people were either the prodigies of the six great ancient families or powerhouses from the heavenly corpse sect. They were also the geniuses of the previous ten Heavenly Kings.</p><p>The last generation of ten Heavenly Kings, including Jiang Taixu, had five people.</p><p>Without a doubt, these five people were extremely terrifying. In the previous tournament, they were already the ten Heavenly Kings, and then they had settled in the peak King’s realm for three years. How terrifying would their battle prowess be?</p><p>It wasn’t that these people couldn’t break through to the spirit ocean realm. They could do it at any time. They just wanted to accumulate more and become more robust. Once they broke through to the spirit ocean realm, there was no doubt that their cultivation would improve greatly and rush to a new height in a short time.</p><p>Of course, the others had not shattered as many pieces, but that did not mean that there were no experts who could match Jiang Taixu and the others. It was normal for some people to hide their strength. Anyway, as long as they shattered nine pieces, they would pass.</p><p>And the 28 broken pieces by Jiang Taixu and the others might not be their limit.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were at the back of the queue. It was their turn the next day.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Jian feiliu, and fatty Kong Jin stepped onto the square together.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on them.</p><p>This was especially so for fatty Kong Jin, Xie nianqing, and Lu Ming. The three of them had reached the 20th step.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was very straightforward. He threw a punch.</p><p>A fist radiance burst out and smashed onto those shields, shattering them one by one.</p><p>As expected, the further back the shield was, the harder it became and the harder it was to break it. Every time a shield exploded, there would be a powerful force that was reflected back at Lu Ming.</p><p>With one punch, the nine shields exploded.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not continue to attack.</p><p>He looked to the side and saw that Xie nianqing had also broken nine pieces, so he stopped.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and smiled. Anyway, nine pieces were enough to pass, so what was the point of breaking so many?</p><p>The rest of the people were speechless. They had wanted to see Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s attack power. They did not expect that the two of them would stop after breaking nine pieces. This made many people feel depressed.</p><p>It was obvious that the two of them didn’t use their full strength at all. It was fine as long as they passed the test.</p><p>Of course, there were also people who opposed it.</p><p>Hmph, maybe his attack power is not high and he doesn’t dare to use his full strength. That’s why he broke the nine shields and deliberately mystified it to attract people’s attention!</p><p>Someone snorted coldly, not optimistic about Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s chances.</p><p>At this moment, there was a commotion.</p><p>Lu Ming turned his head and saw the fat man walking forward smugly. In front of him, there were twenty-eight broken pieces.</p><p>It was no wonder that everyone was so surprised. To be able to break 28 shields, his attack power was already on par with Jiang Taixu and the others.</p><p>“Who is this fatty? I’ve never seen him before. Where did this peerless genius come from?”</p><p>“I’ve never seen him before either. Perhaps he’s a disciple secretly taken in by some peerless expert? There are too many geniuses nowadays.”</p><p>Fatty Kong Jin looked around. He carried a huge axe and grinned, feeling proud of himself.</p><p>Very quickly, this batch of people had all finished and the next batch of people were replaced.</p><p>“Corpse King!”</p><p>In this group, the corpse King went up, and everyone’s eyes were fixed on the corpse King.</p><p>The corpse King was also someone who had reached the 20th step.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The king corpse was very straightforward. It directly threw out a punch, and the terrifying fist force shattered the shields in front of it. After a few punches, it had shattered twenty-eight shields.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>this guy’s strength isn’t bad. I feel like he didn’t use his full strength. Interesting.</p><p>The fatty Kong Jin stood beside Lu Ming, his eyes glimmering as he stared at the corpse King. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>In the next moment, the leg of an unknown demonic beast appeared in his hand, and he began to gnaw on it.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could not be bothered with him.</p><p>As time passed, the candidates went up in batches and came down in batches. One day later, all the assessments were over.</p><p>A total of 120000 people took the test, but only about 40000 passed.</p><p>One could see how difficult it was.</p><p>One had to know that those who could come here were all peak-tier Kings, and many of them had pretty good battle-power at that level. Many of them were old guys who had cultivated for hundreds of years.</p><p>alright, the first round of assessment is over. Those who have passed the first round, follow us to the other piece of the Heavenly King tablet!</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p><p>Then, he flew toward the North with the rest of the heavenly corpse sect.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest followed.</p><p>There were two pieces of the Heavenly King stele. They had already seen one of them, and the other was where the final battle of the Heavenly King ranking would take place.</p><p>In front of him was a deep abyss that was at least ten miles wide. On the other side of the abyss was a huge stone tablet. It was a thousand meters tall and a few hundred meters wide. It was simple and unadorned.</p><p>This was the second piece of the stele.</p><p>there’s a peerless killing formation at the bottom of this abyss. You’ll die for sure if you fall in. The entire abyss is filled with astral winds, making it extremely difficult to fly.</p><p>and the place of your final battle will be inside the Heavenly King tablet, which is a world of its own. In a moment, the Heavenly King tablet will emit light, and at that time, you can rush in. However, the light of the Heavenly King tablet will only last for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. You need to fly across the abyss and rush into the Heavenly King tablet within that time. Those who fail to make it in will be eliminated!</p><p>Dongfang Hao announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
