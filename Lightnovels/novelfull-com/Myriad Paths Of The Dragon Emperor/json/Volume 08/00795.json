Even experts at the peak of the spirit sea realm would die if they stepped in. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>Lu Ming had spent more than ten minutes in the battle to set it up in a hurry. Naturally, it could not be that powerful, but it was enough to deal with Wang Haotian and the rest.</p><p>Wang Haotian, Jiang Taiyou, and the others tried their best to rush out of the formation, leaving five or six corpses in the formation.</p><p>“Damn it!” Wang Haotian roared in anger. Not only did he not get the token he wanted, but Wang Kong was also left behind. If news of this got back to the Wang family, it would be a heavy blow to his reputation.</p><p>“This formation of his was set up at the last minute, so its power is limited. As long as we keep attacking, we’ll be able to exhaust the energy of this great formation, and then we’ll kill our way in!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun said with a dark expression.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll take turns to attack!”</p><p>Wang Haotian said.</p><p>Immediately, they made the necessary arrangements. Luan Fengyun was the first to attack.</p><p>Arrows streaked across the sky like meteors and shot toward the formation below. However, sword Qi whistled through the formation and blocked all the arrows.</p><p>“Little Qing, fatty, you guys focus on recuperating. They won’t be able to break in!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he sat cross-legged at the entrance of the cave.</p><p>His psyche fire was so strong that he could continuously inscribe new inscriptions and inject them into the formation. The attacks of Luan Fengyun and the others were simply unable to break through it.</p><p>Xie nianqing, Kong Jin, ruan Tingting, and the others let out a long breath and relaxed. They began to channel their energy to heal and recover.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jian feiliu, who was in the cave, with a worried look.</p><p>If Jian feiliu wanted to recover, he needed a treasure to replenish his bloodline power. He could only wait until the matter here was over before looking for a treasure to replenish his bloodline power.</p><p>Fortunately, it should not be difficult to find treasures that could replenish bloodline power. Back in the blazing sun Empire, there were blood refinement crystals and blood refinement pills that could replenish bloodline power and increase the level of the second bloodline awakening. Ninedragons would naturally have no shortage of such treasures.</p><p>However, it was a little inconvenient to carry Jian feiliu like this.</p><p>“I wonder if I can store it in the Paragon temple!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. A surge of quintessential essence rolled out and Jian feiliu’s figure disappeared.</p><p>As expected, Jian feiliu appeared in the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It must be because there was no vitality in Jian feiliu’s body that he could be stored.</p><p>In the sky, Luan Fengyun kept attacking. After half an hour, it was Wang Haotian’s turn.</p><p>Just like that, time slowly passed.</p><p>One hour, two hours …</p><p>Very quickly, a day’s time had passed.</p><p>Not only did Luan Fengyun and the others fail to break through the sword howling Thunder formation, but they also exhausted themselves.</p><p>“Damn it, how did this happen? How can his Spirit Fire be so exuberant?”</p><p>Wang Haotian roared in anger. He was so depressed that he was about to vomit blood.</p><p>The others ‘eyes were also red as they glared at Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged at the entrance of the cave.</p><p>“Little Qing, fatty, how’s your recovery?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ve fully recovered, and I can fight a great battle now!” The fatty grinned, revealing a trace of ferocity.</p><p>“I’ve almost recovered!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Then let’s charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In terms of combat power, they were no match for Luan Fengyun and Wang Haotian. They could only rush out first, improve their cultivation, and then kill them in the future.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, a loud sound of something breaking through the air could be heard from afar. It was extremely fast, and by the time everyone heard it, more than a dozen figures had already appeared in the sky.</p><p>These people were all young people. Each of them was wearing armor and a helmet, and their eyes were as sharp as knives.</p><p>The one standing at the front was a young man with a fierce gaze, like a wild beast.</p><p>“Di Tian’s Imperial Guard, long Qianli!”</p><p>Luan Feng Yun couldn’t help but cry out in alarm.</p><p>The others, such as Wang Haotian and Jiang Taiyou, also exclaimed in shock.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were even more shocked.</p><p>They were not only shocked by the Ditian divine guards, but also by the young man, long Qianli.</p><p>Long Qianli was ranked in the top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents. He was a true God-level talent who had awakened a God-level bloodline.</p><p>Luan Fengyun, How dare you! Supremacy lanjin was the commander of Emperor heaven’s Imperial Guards back then. You want to take his successor? ”</p><p>Long Qianli’s eyes swept over Luan Fengyun and the others.</p><p>long Qianli, Blue Gold Knight, has been dead for a long time. His inheritance has no owner. Why can’t we take it? ”</p><p>Luan Feng Yun said.</p><p>“Now that I’ve arrived, you can get lost! Venerable lanjin’s inheritor, we’re going to bring back Di Tian’s Imperial Guards and train them to become venerable lanjin’s true inheritor!”</p><p>Long Qianli said coldly. He was not polite at all, not giving any face to Luan Fengyun and the others.</p><p>The main forces of the Empyrean divine Palace were divided into three major groups. The first group was the Empyrean heavenly Imperial Guards, which were the direct guards of Di Yi and Martial Emperor. They were extremely powerful.</p><p>One was the six great ancient families.</p><p>There were also the sub-palaces in the various large regions.</p><p>In fact, these three forces all obeyed Martial Emperor Di Yi and fought for him. However, they were not harmonious with each other.</p><p>The majority of the Emperor heaven Imperial Guards didn’t come from noble backgrounds. Very few of them were descendants of the six great ancient clans. The majority of them were geniuses like Yan kuangtu, who came from small powers.</p><p>They would continuously take in geniuses and nurture them to become the pillars of Di Tian’s Imperial Guards.</p><p>Back then, the nine suns Supreme had been one of the Supreme commanders of the Ditian royal guards. Now, Yan kuangtu was also one of the Supreme commanders.</p><p>Therefore, the geniuses of the Imperial sky guards had never had a harmonious relationship with the geniuses of the six great ancient clans, and competition between them was common.</p><p>After being berated by long Qianli, Luan Fengyun’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>“Long Qianli, don’t you go too far!”</p><p>Luan Fengyun sternly said.</p><p>“I’m bullying you, what can you do? Do you want to fight me?”</p><p>The ferocity in long Qianli’s eyes became even more intense, as if he was a ferocious beast that was about to attack.</p><p>Hmph. Today, besides me, heavenly brother Wang Hao and the other elites of the Jiang family are here too. We’re not afraid of you!</p><p>Luan Fengyun said coldly, a powerful aura exuding from his body.</p><p>Wang Haotian appeared next to Luan Fengyun, and his aura began to emanate from his body.</p><p>“Hehe, looks like you all want to experience the power of a divine rank bloodline!”</p><p>Long Qianli’s face turned even more ferocious and he sneered.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>All of a sudden, a Dragon’s Roar resounded through the heavens and earth. A flood Dragon rushed out from long Qianli’s body. The flood Dragon was pitch-black all over, and the most shocking thing was that it actually had three heads.</p><p>This was a ferocious beast of the legends, the three-headed demon flood Dragon. It was incomparably powerful.</p><p>It was said that the three-headed demon flood Dragon could even compete with some weaker true dragons. One could imagine how terrifying it was.</p><p>On the three-headed demon snake’s body, a golden chakra attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>The Golden chakra was a God-level bloodline.</p><p>A golden chakra was equivalent to a rank 1 divine bloodline.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
