It can devour blood essence and increase the grade of my bloodline!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Fatty’s empty character was naturally unspeakable. For ruan Tingting, he was willing to risk his life and fight against the chaotic family. At the same time, in order not to implicate them, he didn’t send them any voice transmissions at the beginning.</p><p>They could be said to have experienced life-and-death battles. Lu Ming naturally trusted him.</p><p>Moreover, if they were to travel together more often in the future, the matter of his Blood Meridian would naturally not be kept a secret. Therefore, Lu Ming did not hide the fact that his Blood Meridian had leveled up.</p><p>Of course, he also didn’t mention the bloodline of the nine Dragons, only the secret skill in the bloodline.</p><p>bloodline secret skill! Amazing! Amazing! Why don’t I have such an amazing secret skill? ”</p><p>The fatty pulled a long face and suddenly reached out his hand, fumbling all over Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Hey, fatty, what are you doing? I don’t have that kind of fetish!”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated and said.</p><p>“Let me take a look, let me study it!” Fatty’s small eyes glowed.</p><p>Lu Ming directly kicked the fatty, causing him to fall flat on his face.</p><p>“Fatty, this is the secret of my bloodline. You can’t tell anyone!” Lu Ming urged.</p><p>“I know, let me study it!” Fatty still didn’t give up.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>This time, it was not Lu Ming who spoke. It was Xie nianqing. She glared at the fatty with an unfriendly gaze, a lotus flower dancing in the air between her fingers.</p><p>Fatty immediately became obedient and muttered, ” you only care about your own man. You even hit your friends. I’m so miserable!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes twitched and his face turned red.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing with a smile and said, ” “Your cultivation broke through to the third level of the spiritual ocean tier?”</p><p>He realized that Xie nianqing and fatty had made a breakthrough in the past few days.</p><p>He had been refining the blood essence with all his might, but he had also sensed something along the way.</p><p>“Yes, that’s right!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>it’s useless even if I break through. I can’t beat a freak like you. You actually upgraded to a divine bloodline. Once the bloodlines merge, there’s no point in fighting.</p><p>Fatty muttered.</p><p>then all of you should also awaken your third bloodline as soon as possible. Let’s go, we will return to the hundred venerated mountain now. All of you will go to the hundred venerated tower and obtain the token. After that, we will go to the blood pool together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Of course, they would not go back like this. Instead, they changed their appearances.</p><p>At their level, it was easy to change their appearance and figure. They only needed to control their muscles and bones.</p><p>The main thing was the aura. No matter how the appearance of the bone armor changed, the aura would not change.</p><p>However, this was simple. Lu Ming immediately inscribed an array to conceal their aura on the three of them and concealed all their auras.</p><p>Since he couldn’t change it, he just had to restrain himself.</p><p>The three of them changed their appearance and body shape, changed their clothes, and flew toward the hundred venerated mountain.</p><p>Half a day later, they returned to the hundred Supremes mountain and headed straight for the hundred Supremes Pagoda.</p><p>There were still a few people watching at the bottom of the tower. At this moment, someone was challenging the tower.</p><p>However, the highest level was only the sixth level. Not long after, everyone failed.</p><p>When the light on the sixth floor dimmed, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin rushed into the tower of a hundred talents.</p><p>There were a few other people with him.</p><p>Lu Ming was standing there and watching.</p><p>He wasn’t too worried. Xie nianqing and Kong Jin’s Wills were both very strong and had been comprehended to a very deep level. Moreover, they were both fused together. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to pass the tower of a hundred talents.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent Sonic Boom came from the sky. A hot aura spread down, and a figure covered in purple flames flew over at high speed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, a figure landed on the ground. Wave after wave of scorching aura came.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over. Then, his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>This person was Wang Haotian.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Wang Haotian shouted and strode forward.</p><p>The others quickly stepped back and gave Wang Haotian the best spot.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood still.</p><p>“You’re not retreating?”</p><p>Wang Haotian looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Wang Haotian had been very unhappy these days.</p><p>He brought Wang Kong and Jian feiliu with him, planning to get the token of a higher cultivation sanctuary from Lu Ming. In the end, not only did he not get the token, but Wang Kong died and he was injured.</p><p>Because of this, he was even reprimanded by the elders in his family.</p><p>In the past few days, he had healed his injuries and planned to challenge the tower of a hundred Supremes again, hoping to obtain a token.</p><p>Now, when he told the others to get lost, there were actually still people who didn’t retreat. Was he not giving him face?</p><p>Wang Haotian was furious.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile as he looked at Wang Haotian coldly.</p><p>His original plan was to go to the blood pool and save Jian feiliu. Then, he would go to other cultivation sanctuaries and cultivate for a while to improve his cultivation. After that, he would find an opportunity to kill Wang Haotian.</p><p>However, he did not expect Wang Haotian to offer himself. Lu Ming did not mind taking action now.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming dared to look at him like that, Wang Haotian’s anger grew.</p><p>“Brat, you’re staring at me like that. There’s no need for your eyes to exist anymore.”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s body emitted a cold killing intent.</p><p>At this moment, the tower of a hundred Supremes lit up one level after another. Soon, the fifth level lit up, and the next moment, the sixth level lit up as well.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that it would not take long for Xie nianqing and the rest to reach the ninth level.</p><p>Since that was the case, he might as well get rid of Wang Haotian.</p><p>Wang Haotian, I said I would kill you. Have you forgotten so quickly? ”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up as he spoke coldly.</p><p>Wang Haotian’s expression changed when he heard Lu Ming’s voice. “It’s you, Lu Ming?”</p><p>The bone armor on Lu Ming’s body moved. The next moment, he returned to his original appearance.</p><p>hahaha, it’s really you, Lu Ming. I didn’t expect you to dare to come back and show yourself in front of me. Good, good. This time, I’ll see who can save you!</p><p>Wang Haotian was ecstatic.</p><p>Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that Lu Ming was still in the hundred venerated mountains. He thought that Lu Ming had left long ago and headed to other more advanced cultivation places.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not have any companions by his side. This made him even happier.</p><p>“Why are you so happy? You weren’t my match that day, so why would I need anyone to save you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>that day, you only relied on your formation. Today, I won’t give you a chance. Kill!</p><p>With that, Wang Haotian suddenly exploded. A scorching aura filled the air. He had used all his strength.</p><p>He wanted to use violent attacks to completely suppress Lu Ming so that he would not have the chance to inscribe inscriptions.</p><p>“Why do I need inscriptions to deal with you?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and struck with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, Wang Haotian’s body trembled. The flames on his body flickered. He retreated quickly and almost spat out blood.</p><p>“How could this be? How did your attack become so much stronger?”</p><p>Wang Haotian shouted in disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
