The yellow spring claw!”</p><p>...</p><p>The gray-robed young man struck out with his claw again. A terrifying River wound around his arm, and the world was filled with ghostly wails and wolf howls. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Gao Qiang let out a furious roar and rushed forward. His energy was unrestrained, and the terrifying fist radiance caused the void to tremble continuously.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A loud boom resounded, but after just a few moves, Gao Qiang was forced to retreat. His entire body was covered in a layer of black mist, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Gao Qiang was defeated. He was not a match at all. On the other hand, the other party seemed to be very relaxed. It was unknown how much strength he had used.</p><p>It was obvious that the difference was too great.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Gao Qiang roared unwillingly.</p><p>“Ghost nine of the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>The gray-robed young man replied indifferently.</p><p>“It’s the genius of the heavenly corpse sect, GUI Jiu. I’ve never heard of him. He must be a new genius.”</p><p>“As expected, there are more and more geniuses nowadays.”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings sighed.</p><p>so this is your strength. How disappointing. Trash like you should have been removed from the list of top 1000 talents long ago.</p><p>Ghost nine sneered, then stepped out and returned to the restaurant.</p><p>“It’s actually a genius from the heavenly corpse sect. The cultivation technique of the heavenly corpse sect is extremely strange. It’s not something that ordinary people can resist.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>In the past, when he was in the Tianxuan region, the people from the heavenly corpse sect that he encountered all controlled refined corpses and fought with them, so their own combat strength was not strong.</p><p>Later on, when he met Xue gang in the chaotic Astral Ocean, he discovered that the members of the heavenly corpse sect did not necessarily rely on corpse refinement alone. There were also some who did not rely on corpse refinement, but the martial arts they practiced and the intent domains they comprehended were all extremely strange and powerful.</p><p>It was not without reason that the heavenly corpse sect was able to rise up in such a short period of time and contend against the Empyrean heaven divine Palace.</p><p>The speaker didn’t mean it, but the listener took note of it. This sentence was heard by Gao Qiang.</p><p>His eyes turned cold as he took a step forward and walked towards Lu Ming.”Kid, what did you say? Not something that ordinary people can resist? In that case, you’re not an ordinary person. I’d like to experience it!”</p><p>Gao Qiang had just been defeated by ghost nine and felt embarrassed. He was feeling extremely unhappy. He happened to hear Lu Ming say that the sky corpse sect’s cultivation technique was not something that ordinary people could resist. Did that mean that he, Gao Qiang, was an ordinary person?</p><p>He was powerful. As a heaven’s favorite on the list of top 1000 talents, he had always been proud and arrogant. But today, he had been easily defeated by GUI Jiu, and then he was called an ordinary person by a kid who came out of nowhere. He was so angry that he couldn’t control himself.</p><p>He wanted to get back some face from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had only made an objective comment and he was targeted.</p><p>“Brother Gao, I’m not talking about you. Many people do have a headache when they encounter the strange cultivation technique of the heavenly corpse sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming explained.</p><p>“Shut up! Who Do You Think You Are? are you even worthy of being my brother? Also, do you mean that many geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents are no match for GUI Jiu, but you are?”</p><p>Gao Qiang berated and asked Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Was Gao Qiang sick?</p><p>“Gao Qiang, I advise you to get lost. Don’t be so shameless!”</p><p>Jian feiliu shouted coldly and his face looked terrible.</p><p>Their argument aroused the curiosity of the others, and they all looked over.</p><p>“Who are these young people? It seems Gao Qiang is going to get back his face from them.”</p><p>“Don’t kick an iron plate again!”</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>“How can it be that easy? Gao Qiang is still very strong, how could he be so unlucky to kick an iron plate so easily?”</p><p>The people at the side were discussing and watching with interest.</p><p>After being scolded by Jian feiliu, Gao Qiang’s face turned even colder. His eyes were like a ferocious beast as he looked at Jian feiliu and said,”Brat, I’m going to cripple one of your arms today just because of your words!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His powerful Qi was violent as he punched at Jian feiliu.</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes turned cold. Golden light bloomed from his eyes. He put his fingers together like a sword and slashed out.</p><p>A golden sword light flashed, as if it could cut through everything. The powerful fist light was cut in half like tofu. The sword light did not stop and continued to cut towards Gao Qiang’s arm.</p><p>Gao Qiang’s face turned pale with fright as he retreated frantically. At the same time, his bloodline burst out, causing his body to swell up rapidly and his aura to become even stronger.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>Jian feiliu’s eyes turned golden and his body was as sharp as a sword.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The golden sword light burst out and cut through the void in an instant. Then, a shrill scream was heard. Everyone saw Gao Qiang retreating madly, and one of his arms had already disappeared.</p><p>Just now, Gao Qiang said that he wanted to cripple one of Jian feiliu’s arms. Now, Jian feiliu had cut off his arm with one sword.</p><p>Crushing, completely crushing.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Gao Qiang roared madly. He circulated his Zhen Yuan and sealed his wound, preventing it from bleeding.</p><p>His eyes were bloodshot. It was too tragic. One of his arms had been cut off, and his vitality was greatly damaged. It was destined that he would not be able to compete with the other geniuses.</p><p>He was angry, he was unwilling.</p><p>“Jian feiliu!”</p><p>Jian feiliu reported his name.</p><p>Jian feiliu, it’s Jian feiliu. He’s ranked 788th on the list of top 1000 talents. He’s a few hundred places higher than Gao Qiang. The gap is huge.</p><p>no wonder it’s so one-sided. He actually met Jian feiliu. This Gao Qiang is really unlucky. First, he met the genius of the heavenly corpse sect, and now, he has to face Jian feiliu.</p><p>“It’s all because he’s too arrogant. He thought that he was in his palm-sized place. What is this place? Powerhouses are gathering in the Heavenly King domain now. Isn’t he looking for death by being so arrogant?”</p><p>“That’s true. Who are those two young men? To be able to stand next to Jian feiliu, I’m afraid he must have had a good start. Is he also a top talent on the list of top 1000 talents?”</p><p>“Even if he’s not on the list of top 1000 talents, he’s still extraordinary!”</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>“Jian feiliu, fine, I admit defeat!”</p><p>Gao Qiang bellowed like an injured wild beast. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was all his fault. If not for Lu Ming’s words, he would not have found Lu Ming and offended Jian feiliu. It was all Lu Ming’s fault.</p><p>If not for Jian feiliu, he would have killed Lu Ming right then and there.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a long howl was heard, and a few beams of light flew over.</p><p>The light dissipated, and a few figures appeared.</p><p>“Qin qingfei? Qin Qingshan?”</p><p>Lu Ming was taken aback. He did not expect to meet Qin qingfei and Qin Qingshan here, and behind them was an old man.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect to meet you here. Haha, it’s time to settle our scores!”</p><p>Qin qingfei sneered. The aura on his body was powerful. Clearly, after this period of time, Qin qingfei’s cultivation had also broken into the peak realm.</p><p>“With just a piece of trash like you?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at him and said in disdain.</p><p>“What did you just say? Don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you have some strength. Let me tell you, there are many people who can suppress you. Let’s see who can save you today.”</p><p>Qin qingfei laughed coldly.</p><p>“Oh, really? That’s good, I’m also going to settle the score with you that day!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out, his gaze turning cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
