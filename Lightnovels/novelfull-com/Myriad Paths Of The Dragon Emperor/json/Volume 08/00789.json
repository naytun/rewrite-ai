It descended like the arm of a Supreme demon and pressed down on Jiang Taiyou.</p><p>It was clear that Xie nianqing’s cultivation had also improved and reached the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>The palm seemed to have locked onto Jiang Taiyou. Jiang Taiyou could not avoid it in the field of the heavenly demon.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s expression changed slightly. His palm was like a sword as he slashed out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s hand clashed with Xie nianqing’s demonic hand. Xie nianqing’s demonic hand was defeated, but Jiang Taixu was forced to take three steps back.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings widened their eyes.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou was ranked 419th on the list of top 1000 talents. His cultivation had already reached the limit of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier. Yet, he was defeated by Xie nianqing, who was only at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>“Good, very good. Little girl, you’ve successfully angered me.”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes were cold. The dark light on his body became even more intense, and a sharp aura emanated from him, tearing the space apart.</p><p>At the same time, a black iron sword floated above his head. The iron sword was thin and long, like a poisonous snake.</p><p>The nine silver chakras were shining brightly.</p><p>This was Jiang Taiyou’s bloodline.</p><p>Back then, Jiang Taixu’s bloodline was a mountain, and the mountain was filled with all kinds of weapons.</p><p>However, Jiang Taiyou’s bloodline was different. It was only a sword, but it was purer.</p><p>An extremely sharp artistic conception emanated from Jiang Taiyou’s body. It was a vast sword power.</p><p>sword concept! That’s the sword concept!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The sword concept was also an evolved concept. It was evolved from the metal concept.</p><p>Those who had awakened weapon-type bloodlines such as swords and sabers were the easiest to comprehend the creation of metal.</p><p>As for the metal mentality, it could evolve into the sword mentality, saber mentality, spear mentality, and so on.</p><p>For example, the sword mentality, combined with the sword-type bloodline and the corresponding sword techniques, was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Jiang Taiyou shouted. His arm was like a sword, slashing out.</p><p>The extremely sharp sword Qi slashed forward, as if it could cut through all obstacles.</p><p>The sky demon force field was torn apart in an instant.</p><p>“The demonic lotus throne!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing frowned slightly and pressed his hands again. This time, a Lotus platform appeared in the air. The Lotus platform was black and a black petal flew out. It was extremely sharp and confronted Jiang Taiyou’s sword Qi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sharp sound rang out, and the two of them canceled each other out.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s expression darkened and he launched a frenzied attack. However, Xie nianqing was also extremely powerful. For a moment, he was locked in a stalemate with Jiang Taiyou.</p><p>The others ‘expressions were grave. Xie nianqing was too strong. He was only at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier. If she broke through to the third level of the spiritual ocean tier, what would happen? Would he be able to suppress Jiang Taiyou with a flip of his hand?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xie nianqing and Jiang Taiyou had exchanged dozens of moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With another blow, the two of them were forced back.</p><p>let’s end this quickly. Why don’t we join forces and capture this woman? ”</p><p>Luan Tianhao said.</p><p>“Good! Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou nodded with a dark face.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s combat power was beyond his expectations.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing controlled the sky demon force field. Within the force field, she was unbelievably fast and appeared at the entrance of the cave in an instant.</p><p>fatty, you heal first. I’ll block here!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>no, you can’t fight against so many of them alone. They’re taking turns to attack you. You can’t hold them back. You’d better break out alone!</p><p>Kong Jin said.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said coldly, but he had no intention of leaving.</p><p>Kong Jin was speechless. Then, he said, ” why don’t we send a voice transmission to Lu Ming and ask him to come over? with the three of us, we should be able to get out of here.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll send him a message!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. He took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taixu continued to attack Xie nianqing. Xie nianqing was blocking the entrance of the cave, so they had to attack alone.</p><p>While the battle was going on, Lu Ming received Xie nianqing’s message on the way. He was even more anxious and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>miss Qiao, it’s very dangerous over there. Don’t go over. I’ll rush over and save fatty and the others first!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took a step forward and his speed increased sharply, heading forward.</p><p>……</p><p>At this time, in the Wang family, in Wang Haotian’s courtyard, Wang Kong stood beside Wang Haotian and reported the news.</p><p>“He really said that?”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming is unruly and lawless. He doesn’t care about you at all, brother Haotian!”</p><p>Wang Kong said.</p><p>“Hehe, unruly? That’s because I haven’t met anyone who can tame him. I’ll make him bow down to me. Wang Kong, take that trash with the surname Jian and come with me to the hundred venerated mountain. I’d like to see how arrogant he can be in front of me. ”</p><p>Wang Haotian said, and a cold killing intent filled the air.</p><p>alright, I heard that the good-for-nothing with the surname Jian is a good friend of Lu Ming. Hehe, he actually dared to date a woman from my Wang family. He’s really bold!</p><p>Wang Kong sneered coldly and walked out of the courtyard. Soon, Wang Haotian and Wang Kong were heading toward the hundred venerated mountains with a person.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the entrance of the cave, the battle had been going on for three hours.</p><p>The six elites of the Jiang family and the Luan family took turns to attack Xie nianqing. No matter how strong Xie nianqing’s true element was, he couldn’t hold on any longer. He was sweating and panting heavily.</p><p>“B * tch, let’s see how long you can last!”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou was attacking Xie nianqing again.</p><p>The storm-like attacks made Xie nianqing’s sky demon force field tremble violently. It seemed that it was difficult to maintain it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of blows, and Xie nianqing’s breathing became heavier.</p><p>“B * tch, I’ll destroy your cultivation and bring you back to the Jiang family to ‘serve’ you well.”</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s face turned colder, but the evil fire in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>The stronger Xie nianqing was, the more he aroused his desire to possess him.</p><p>“You won’t have that chance!”</p><p>At this time, an extremely cold voice came from the distance. In the sky far away, a spear radiance cut through the void, bringing with it a terrifying Sonic Boom, and stabbed toward Jiang Taiyou.</p><p>Jiang Taiyou’s expression changed. His palm was like a divine sword as he struck out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His palm collided with the spear radiance.</p><p>In a split second, Jiang Taiyou’s face changed greatly. With a quiver, he retreated rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in the air, holding a long spear. A bone-chilling killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>Lu Ming had arrived!</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally here!” Xie nianqing whispered.</p><p>“Little Qing, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I’m fine!” Xie nianqing shook his head.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, you’re here. It looks like your cultivation has improved greatly. This is great. Let’s charge out together!”</p><p>Fatty laughed.</p><p>“Fatty, looks like you’re not dead yet.”</p><p>Looking at Kong Jin’s body that was covered in blood, Lu Ming’s eyes turned even colder.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
