He used guerilla tactics. A golden sword light kept moving around, attacking the Jiang family members from time to time to distract them and help Xie nianqing reduce the pressure.</p><p>...</p><p>Jiang Taixu went crazy and charged at Xie nianqing. However, Xie nianqing’s bloodline martial skill was extremely powerful. Combined with the cutting power of the sky demon force field, he had the upper hand.</p><p>haha, Jiang Taixu, it seems like you’re really done for. You can’t even take down a woman!</p><p>On the side, Wang Jue laughed.</p><p>“Wang Jue, are you just going to watch the show from the side?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>He was Wang Jue’s competitor, and he knew that Wang Jue had done it on purpose.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Wang Jue smiled, but he was also very shocked in his heart.</p><p>He did not make a move because he thought that Jiang Taixu would be able to take down Xie nianqing and the others without him. In fact, if Jiang Taixu could not take down Xie nianqing in a short time, it would be a blow to his reputation. Then, he would make a move and decide the outcome in one fell swoop.</p><p>However, he had never expected that Jiang Taixu would be at a disadvantage. Xie nianqing’s strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>In the depths of his eyes, a murderous intent flashed.</p><p>He suddenly agreed with Jiang Taixu’s way of doing things. With these people here, would they still have a share in the first place?</p><p>“Jiang Taixu, let me help you win this girl over!”</p><p>Terrifying flames spread out from Wang Jue’s body, and the surrounding temperature rose sharply.</p><p>The purple flame seemed to have turned Wang Jue purple.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wang Jue’s whole body was like a burning meteor, rushing into the sky demon power field and killing Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes turned serious.</p><p>“The hand of the heavenly Devil!”</p><p>She formed a seal with both hands, and two beautiful arms condensed in the air. One on the left and one on the right, they struck toward Jiang Taixu and Wang Jue respectively.</p><p>“Slut, break!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu turned into a heavenly weapon, like a strand of hair. He put his palms together and struck out.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>The void seemed to split open, and the palm struck a demonic hand.</p><p>On the other side, Wang Jue’s body turned into flames, burning everything as he threw out a shocking punch.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky trembled and Xie nianqing’s face turned pale. He trembled and took nine steps back.</p><p>The sky demon power field trembled and almost dissipated.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>In the outside world, the metal sword sect’s people had very heavy expressions.</p><p>Wang Jue and Jiang Taixu were too powerful when they joined forces. Who in the same realm could defeat them?</p><p>In addition, the Jiang family still had more than a dozen experts, and the Wang family also had some experts who had not made a move yet.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu were probably dead.</p><p>“B * tch, I’ll kill you if you still resist!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted.</p><p>nest, are you guys f * cking shameless? a group of people bullying two people. I can’t stand it anymore!</p><p>A voice rang out. A fat man carrying a battle-axe rushed over at top speed.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>Fatty Kong Jin was also the one who had reached the 20th step and shattered 28 shields. Moreover, he seemed to be very close to Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the others.</p><p>Fatty Kong Jin’s arrival made Jiang Taixu and the others frown.</p><p>“Damn fatty, I advise you not to meddle in other people’s business. Otherwise, you’ll end up in a very bad state,”</p><p>Jiang Taixu stared at Kong Jin with an unfriendly look.</p><p>fat my ass! You’re the fat one! Your whole family is fat!</p><p>Fatty’s eyes widened as he cursed. When he turned to look at Xie nianqing, he put on a smile.”Little sister, are you alright?”</p><p>“Who’s your sister?”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes widened.</p><p>“My wife is your sister. Of course, you are my sister. Where is my brother-in-law, Lu Ming?”</p><p>Kong Jin’s eyes darted left and right.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie nianqing was speechless. He had never seen such a shameless person.</p><p>so many people joining hands to deal with two people. You’re really shameless. Today, I’m going to deal with you!</p><p>Kong Jin grabbed his great axe and revealed a hint of ferocity in his eyes.</p><p>“You guys, kill this fatty!”</p><p>Wang Jue waved his hand and said to the Wang family.</p><p>Wang Jue had also brought more than ten people, each of whom was an expert.</p><p>“Kill this fatty!”</p><p>Wang mie, who was also among them, waved his hand.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>More than ten Wang family experts charged toward Kong Jin.</p><p>“Eat my axe!”</p><p>Kong Jin held his axe with both hands, stepped forward, and chopped down.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The next moment, an expert of the Wang family was cut in half.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>With a wave of his axe, two of the Wang family experts were cut in half.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, I’ll kill you first!”</p><p>Kong Jin’s fat body was like an ancient beast. He was carrying a giant axe that was as big as a door. No one could block his axe.</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>This fatty was too strong. Those Wang family members were definitely experts. They were extremely strong existences among those at the same level, but none of them could block his axe.</p><p>Wang mie could only feel his body trembling and cold sweat pouring down.</p><p>Inhuman, this fatty was simply inhuman. He was terrifyingly strong.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, eight out of the ten Wang family experts had been killed by the fatty.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Wang mie turned around and ran.</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>Kong Jin berated. He looked at Wang Jue and Jiang Taixu and said, I heard that you guys were the last batch of the Bullsh * t ten Heavenly Kings. I was just about to give it a try, so you’re the one!</p><p>Kong Jin pointed his battle-axe at Jiang Taixu. He rushed toward Jiang Taixu with the battle-axe in hand.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s expression turned ugly. His palm was like a divine weapon as he struck at the fatty.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s body trembled violently and he was sent flying backward.</p><p>“Let’s go out and fight. I won’t take advantage of you!”</p><p>Kong Jin said as he flew out of the area covered by the sky demon power field.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s expression changed and became extremely gloomy.</p><p>Kong Jin’s combat strength was too terrifying. Although he had been at a disadvantage in the sky demon power field earlier, who knew if Kong Jin had used his full strength? even if he had left the sky demon power field, he was not sure if he could defeat Kong Jin. He even had a feeling that he would not be able to defeat Kong Jin.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared in his heart.</p><p>How could there be such a perverted person?</p><p>“What are you doing? If you don’t dare, then hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>Kong Jin berated.</p><p>brother Jiang, I think we should retreat first. This fatty is unfathomable and difficult to deal with. It won’t be too late to deal with them after we gather more people!</p><p>Wang Jue’s expression also changed, and then he sent a message to Jiang Taixu.</p><p>With Kong Jin’s addition, it would be impossible for them to take down Xie nianqing and the others.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu shouted and turned to leave.</p><p>The rest of the people followed Jiang Taixu and left.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Xie nianqing let out a long breath.</p><p>Previously, she had controlled the heavenly Devil force field to trap so many experts at the same time and had to launch attacks continuously. At the same time, she had to deal with Jiang Taixu, which had consumed too much energy.</p><p>If they continued fighting, they might not be able to hold on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
