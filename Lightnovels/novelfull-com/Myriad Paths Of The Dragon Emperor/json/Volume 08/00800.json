It was the same as a few days ago. Why did his attack suddenly increase so much?</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm seemed to have the power to suppress everything. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, I don’t need inscriptions to kill you! Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent burst out. He took a big step forward and his palm was like a divine monument, slashing toward Wang Haotian.</p><p>The prison suppressing heavenly technique would become stronger as the bloodline of the prison suppressing stele leveled up.</p><p>The prison suppressing stele’s bloodline had reached the divine level, and the prison suppressing heavenly technique’s power was equivalent to the sixth stage of a demigod-level martial technique.</p><p>Its power was more than ten times stronger than before.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s cultivation level had not changed, his combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>Wang Haotian was shocked and furious. He used all his strength to block the attack, but he was still completely suppressed by Lu Ming. He was forced to retreat and cough up blood.</p><p>Below the tower, the other people were even more dumbfounded.</p><p>A few days ago, Lu Ming had stopped the nine geniuses of the three aristocratic families almost by himself, shocking the hundred venerates mountain.</p><p>They did not expect that the person who was standing beside them just now was Lu Ming.</p><p>And now, Lu Ming had exploded with terrifying combat strength. He did not use the Dao of inscription. He suppressed Wang Haotian with pure combat strength, leaving Wang Haotian unable to fight back.</p><p>How did Lu Ming’s combat strength increase so much in just a few days?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm. Wang Haotian’s arm cracked and his bone armor was broken. He spat out blood and was sent flying. He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>Wang Haotian roared and turned to run.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and gave chase. After a thousand miles, Lu Ming suddenly accelerated and stood in front of Wang Haotian.</p><p>“There’s no one here now, just in time to kill you!” Lu Ming’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Although your combat strength is stronger than mine, you want to kill me? dream on!”</p><p>Wang Haotian shouted.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The sneer at the corner of Lu Ming’s mouth became even more intense.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele appeared above Lu Ming’s head. The dazzling golden light almost blinded Wang Haotian.</p><p>His eyes almost popped out of their sockets as he roared in disbelief, ” divine bloodline! You’ve awakened a divine bloodline!</p><p>His voice was filled with shock, jealousy, hatred, and fear.</p><p>He was determined to use the token to go to the blood pool, accumulate the power of his bloodline, awaken a divine bloodline, and become a divine level genius.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming was the first to succeed in his unfulfilled wish. How could he not be jealous?</p><p>He was also terrified because he knew how terrifying a divine bloodline was.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without thinking, he turned around and fled.</p><p>“It’s too late to escape now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body turned into a ray of light and entered the prison-suppressing stele’s Blood Meridian.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline trembled. It pierced through the space and pressed down on Wang Haotian like an ancient mountain.</p><p>Wang Haotian had nowhere to run. He was terrified by the terrifying pressure.</p><p>All his attacks and defenses were useless in front of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“No, my sister will take revenge for me!”</p><p>Wang Haotian shouted, and then his voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele, Wang Haotian was torn into pieces and died on the spot.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shrunk and turned back into Lu Ming. He waved his hand and put away Wang Haotian’s storage ring, devouring his blood essence.</p><p>Then, flames appeared and turned Wang Haotian’s body into ashes.</p><p>In a flash, Lu Ming left the place and returned to the tower of a hundred Supremes.</p><p>Of course, he had already changed his form again.</p><p>At this moment, the eighth floor of the tower of a hundred Supremes had already lit up.</p><p>The few people at the bottom of the tower did not even notice his return. They just stared at the tower of a hundred Supremes in a daze.</p><p>They were naturally shocked that someone had made it to the eighth level.</p><p>“The ninth floor has lit up!”</p><p>Someone suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>“It’s really the ninth floor. Someone else has made it to the ninth floor. Is it one of the two? A woman and a fatty!”</p><p>the others have all come out. Only the two of them are left. Amazing!</p><p>The others sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>……</p><p>In the Wang family, at the head of the Dragon’s Vein, there was a chain of volcanoes that erupted all year round. Because this was the Dragon’s Vein, the temperature of the flames here was frighteningly high, hundreds of times higher than ordinary volcanoes.</p><p>Suddenly, an angry roar came from one of the volcanoes. The next moment, a Firebird made of flames flew out of the volcano and turned into a beautiful woman.</p><p>However, the woman’s body exuded an extremely cold killing intent, and the hot flames seemed to be able to burn through the world.</p><p>“Haotian, who killed you? I will make your murderer suffer the most painful torture in the world!”</p><p>The woman spat out a cold and ruthless killing intent.</p><p>She raised her hand. There was a Jade tablet in her palm with the words ‘Wang Haotian’ written on it. However, the Jade tablet had already been torn into pieces.</p><p>This was Wang Haotian’s life token. If the life token was broken, it meant that he was dead!</p><p>There were also other Wang family members cultivating in the volcano range.</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard.</p><p>“What happened? Wang haoxian is going crazy!”</p><p>“I don’t know. Did something happen to Wang Haotian? It’s no small matter for a God-tier heaven’s favorite to go crazy!”</p><p>“This is not something we can interfere in!”</p><p>Soon, the voice died down.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s figure disappeared in a flash and soon appeared in Wang Haotian’s courtyard.</p><p>After a while, Wang haoxian left Wang Haotian’s courtyard and flew toward the hundred venerated mountain.</p><p>Hundred venerates mountain, hundred venerates Pagoda.</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the ninth level.</p><p>Suddenly, all the lights on the ninth floor dimmed and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, the tower of a hundred Supremes glowed. Xie nianqing and Kong Jin appeared in the air at the same time and descended.</p><p>The other people’s gazes fell on them in unison.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“If I take action, there will naturally be no problem.” Kong Jin grinned.</p><p>Xie nianqing also nodded.</p><p>It was obvious that both of them had obtained tokens.</p><p>alright, let’s leave this place immediately. We’ll leave the hundred venerated mountains!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>From the beginning, he didn’t know why, but he had a bad feeling in his heart, as if a crisis was coming.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Kong Jin nodded. The three of them turned into three rays of light and left the place. They headed towards the exit at top speed. Soon, they exited the exit and flew towards the West. Their destination was the blood pool.</p><p>Not long after they left, Wang haoxian arrived and rushed into the hundred venerated mountain.</p><p>God-tier prodigy Wang haoxian. Why is she here? ”</p><p>One of the old men guarding the entrance asked in bewilderment.</p><p>At the foot of the tower, a few young men were still in shock. They were shocked that two people had actually made it to the ninth floor.</p><p>They were guessing if the two of them had obtained the token. What was his identity? It was actually so powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying pressure descended. The cold killing intent mixed with the hot aura and pressed down on their bodies.</p><p>Their bodies trembled, and they knelt on the ground.</p><p>Wang haoxian’s eyes were cold and his killing intent was as cold as ice as he stepped through the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
