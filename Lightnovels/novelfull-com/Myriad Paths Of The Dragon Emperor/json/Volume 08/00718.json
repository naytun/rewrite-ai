He escaped into the underground world.</p><p>...</p><p>In the beginning, his heart was filled with hatred and he wanted to take revenge.</p><p>Thus, he imparted the Dao of inscription to the underground humans, hoping to cultivate an Imperial path expert to avenge him.</p><p>Thus, he became the ancient ancestor of the underground humans.</p><p>But later, he realized that the underground humans had a special Constitution. Perhaps because they lived underground, they were different from the great Dao of heaven and earth and were forever separated from the sun, moon, and stars. Thus, the underground humans were not like the people outside the earth, who had infinite possibilities. The humans here could only cultivate to the sixth level at most.</p><p>That’s right, rank six was equivalent to the spirit sea realm, which was also the God rank that the Underdark humans called.</p><p>How could a level six help him take revenge?</p><p>His remnant soul couldn’t go out to find a successor. As a sovereign realm expert, he was afraid that Martial Emperor Di Yi would sense him as soon as he went out.</p><p>out of helplessness, lian cang made nine jade swords and found a few peak lv 6 experts to send them out of the underground world. they built an entrance to the underground world and scattered the nine jade swords everywhere in hopes of finding a fated person who could enter the underground world and become lian cang’s inheritor to avenge him.</p><p>He had deliberately spread the news underground, saying that if someone from the outside world came in, there would be a person inside who could wake him up.</p><p>However, as time went by, no one came in. Lian Cang was slowly losing hope. A wisp of his soul fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, 3000 years had passed. Who would have thought that after 3000 years, someone would finally come in. Furthermore, there were two people who had made it to the last stage.</p><p>As soon as Xie nianqing and Lu Ming entered the last cave, Lian Cang sensed them instantly due to the formation. He woke up from his deep sleep.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart after hearing that.</p><p>It was another Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>He couldn’t help but think of the nine suns Supreme, who had also been killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi and only had a wisp of his soul left.</p><p>The two unrivaled heroes had similar endings.</p><p>“You’re the Empyrean heaven Divine Guard of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace, right? i can sense the fluctuations of the divine guard token on you!”</p><p>Lian Cang looked at Lu Ming. In his eyes, there seemed to be the sun, the moon, and the stars.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. Lian Cang and Martial Emperor Di Yi were enemies. Would he kill him?</p><p>A layer of cold sweat seeped out of his back as he thought of this.</p><p>Xie nianqing moved and stood in front of Lu Ming. He stared at Lian Cang.</p><p>Even if he was an Emperor, if he wanted to kill Lu Ming, he would have to fight.</p><p>haha, this young couple has a good relationship. You’re very bold too. I like it.</p><p>Lian Cang laughed.</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed, but he gritted his teeth and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Looking at Xie nianqing’s slender back view, Lu Ming’s heart was filled with warmth. He took a step forward and held Xie nianqing’s hand, standing side by side with him.</p><p>well, the two of you are equally talented, a perfect match for each other. Don’t worry, you two little guys. My grudge with Di Yi has nothing to do with anyone else. Besides, although this little guy is Di Tian’s Divine Guard, I’m afraid he has never even seen Di Yi’s face. Why would he be implicated!”</p><p>Said Lian Cang with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>To be honest, even a wisp of soul would be extremely terrifying when facing an Emperor.</p><p>The difference was too great. A single breath from an Imperial figure could kill them eight to ten times over.</p><p>senior, if you’re not happy, I’ll have to go against Martial Emperor Di Yi sooner or later!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“You and Martial Emperor Di Yi will go against each other? You’re just a martial King, what kind of enmity do you have with him? Wait, could it be the one in your body?”</p><p>Lian Cang’s eyes seemed to be able to see through everything.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body glowed like the sun. The next moment, a figure appeared and floated in the air.</p><p>“Senior Jiuyang!”</p><p>Lu Ming exclaimed in a low voice. The figure was the nine suns Supreme.</p><p>“Junior Jiu yang greets senior Lian. It has been thousands of years since we last met.”</p><p>The nine suns Supreme Master cupped his hands and saluted to Lian Cang.</p><p>Lian Cang frowned slightly. Then, his eyes lit up, ” “You’re Jiuyang? What was going on? From your soul fluctuations, I can tell that you’ve already reached the Supreme-level, right? with your heaven-defying bloodline and physique, it wouldn’t be easy for an ordinary Emperor to take you down. How did you end up like this?”</p><p>Three thousand years ago, before the incident with Lian Cang, the Supreme Master of the nine suns had just risen to power. He was the most brilliant heaven’s favorite of that era. Lian Cang had seen him a few times, so he recognized him.</p><p>Supreme Master Jiuyang revealed a bitter smile on his face and roughly told him about his experience.</p><p>“What? You were also killed by that old man Di Yi. That old man Di Yi is despicable to the extreme!”</p><p>Lian Cang shouted in anger.</p><p>He had been killed by Di Yi. Because they belonged to two different forces, it was normal for them to be in a competitive relationship. However, Supreme nine suns was the disciple of Martial Emperor Di Yi. He had fought for Martial Emperor Di Yi all his life, but now he had ended up like this. How sad was that? It was really a pity.</p><p>“What does Di Yi want to do? Does he want to unify the entire Eastern barren territory?”</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>as far as I know, his target is not just the East continent!</p><p>Supreme ninesuns said.</p><p>“What? He’s so ambitious!” Liao Cang said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood aside and listened quietly. They had heard many secrets from the nine suns Supreme and Lian Cang. They were not qualified to know these secrets with their cultivation.</p><p>At this time, Lian Cang looked at Lu Ming again. no wonder I felt that this kid’s bloodline is extraordinary. He has awakened the nine Dragon bloodline. But it will be difficult to fight against Di Yi!</p><p>“Now that things have come to this, I can only take one step at a time!” Nine suns Supreme Master sighed.</p><p>but it’s not like there’s no chance at all. From what you’ve said, the Battle of Destiny is coming soon. If the Battle of Destiny goes well, there might be a chance.</p><p>Lian Cang pondered for a while and looked at Lu Ming, ” “Lu Ming, are you willing to be my disciple?”</p><p>“Acknowledge a master?” Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>I can see that you are very talented in the Dao of inscription. I can teach you everything I have learned in my life. This way, you will have more capital to fight against Martial Emperor Di Yi in the future!</p><p>Liao Cang said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why aren’t you acknowledging me as your master?” he asked. Supreme Master of nine suns urged.</p><p>“Disciple Lu Ming greets master!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and knelt down to pay his respects as a master and disciple.</p><p>To be able to acknowledge an Imperial path powerhouse as a master, how could there be any reason for him to be unwilling? this was a great opportunity.</p><p>“Good, good, good, hahaha!”</p><p>Lian Cang laughed.</p><p>Then, he pointed his finger at Lu Ming’s glabella. A ray of light flashed and Lu Ming suddenly felt that something had been added to his mind.</p><p>As for what it was, he felt that it was a little blurry and couldn’t see clearly.</p><p>my dear disciple, I’ve already sealed everything I’ve learned and some of my cultivation experiences into an array. Now, I’ve inserted it into your mind. You can slowly watch and cultivate in the future.</p><p>however, there are many layers of seals in that array. With your current cultivation, you can only view things at rank 5 and below. Once you become a rank 6 Alchemist, you’ll naturally be able to view everything that a rank 6 Alchemist has to offer.</p><p>Lian Cang explained.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
