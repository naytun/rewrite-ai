They’ve already reached their limits!</p><p>it’s already very shocking. Although the higher they go, it doesn’t mean that their combat power is stronger, but at least it shows that these two people’s willpower and martial heart are extremely tough and terrifying. They have endless potential!</p><p>that’s right. If they break through to the spiritual ocean tier, they will easily enter the top 500 on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>I wonder how long they can stay on the 18th step!</p><p>Many people nodded and were somewhat amazed.</p><p>These were two newly risen heaven’s favorites. During this period of time, there had been quite a number of new rising heaven’s favorites.</p><p>On the 18th step, the other five closed their eyes and began to cultivate when they saw Lu Ming and Lin Feng sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, who was on the 19th step, did not open his eyes from the beginning to the end. It seemed that nothing below the 19th step could arouse his interest.</p><p>Lu Ming did not continue to advance not because he could not, but because he felt that he should be able to cultivate on the 18th step.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and above him, the huge figure was still berating him, telling him to roll down.</p><p>At the same time, countless rays of light of various colors shot towards him.</p><p>“It’s not good to bear this kind of pressure and pain all the time!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>However, this could also be considered a form of training. At the same time, the various colored attacks contained all sorts of heaven and earth intent realms. They were left behind by peerless powerhouses in ancient times.</p><p>This was an unparalleled wealth. Those with high talent could comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth from it, and even comprehend unparalleled combat skills.</p><p>Only martial King realm martial artists could enter the heaven King List, and only then would it be effective. If it was someone in the sea of soul realm or even higher, it would have no effect at all.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes, his mind wandering.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. He had just caught a flash of lightning.</p><p>“This Thunder domain is compatible with me. I have to capture it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully. After a while, he sensed the wisp of Thunder concept again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, his Thunder mentality turned into a rope and flew out at an extreme speed, wrapping around the Thunder mentality.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s mind was buzzing. The environment seemed to have changed.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he had appeared in a void. In the void, there was a figure jumping around, performing the concept of Thunder.</p><p>what a wonderful Thunder mentality. So, the Thunder mentality can be used like this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was mesmerized with just one look, his eyes fixed on it.</p><p>He realized that his comprehension of the Thunder concept was constantly improving.</p><p>Just like that, time slowly passed. Lu Ming seemed to have forgotten about the attack, pressure, and pain outside. He focused on comprehending the concept of Thunder.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, there was only one Thunder concept rune. All of a sudden, a new Thunder concept rune spread out. This newly born Thunder concept rune was only an inch long, much shorter than the previous one. The moment it appeared, it intertwined with the first one and complemented each other.</p><p>Level two concept. Lu Ming’s Thunder concept had successfully broken through to level two.</p><p>He had finally broken through the bottleneck and entered level two.</p><p>However, this was still far from enough. Lu Ming still had three intents that needed to reach the second level. Otherwise, his cultivation would not be able to break through to the spirit ocean realm.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued cultivating. This time, he did not continue to comprehend the Thunder mentality. Instead, he began to capture other concepts.</p><p>Not long after, he successfully captured the concept of wind and started to comprehend it.</p><p>Time passed by slowly.</p><p>There were more and more people on the Heavenly King stele. Some people climbed up the steps, while others couldn’t hold on and were blasted down. There were many people coming and going.</p><p>During this period of time, many more geniuses had appeared. A few more people had appeared on the 17th and 18th steps.</p><p>However, Jiang Taixu was the only one on the 19th step.</p><p>The few heaven’s favorites who were as famous as Jiang Taixu were not here. They might be cultivating somewhere else. In the blink of an eye, another six days had passed. It was the thirteenth day since Lu Ming stepped onto the Heavenly King’s tablet.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>now, my wind and thunder intents have both reached level two. I should upgrade my earth intent to level one completion, or even level two. Only then will my prison suppressing heaven technique be stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming looked up. He had to climb the higher steps. He had tried earlier but he did not capture a suitable earth concept on the 18th step. He could only go up.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming stood up.</p><p>Below, many people looked at him curiously.</p><p>that Lu Ming has gotten up. He has been up there for thirteen days. I reckon he can’t take it anymore and has retreated!</p><p>he stayed on the 18th step for 13 days. That’s already terrifying enough.</p><p>what’s even more shocking is Jiang Taixu. He has been stuck on the 19th step for so long.</p><p>Jiang Taixu might be aiming for the first place on the Heavenly King List this time!</p><p>However, the next moment, everyone’s discussion came to an abrupt end. Everyone’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>This was because they realized that Lu Ming was not going to retreat. He was actually going up.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the 19th step with determination and stood firmly on it.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s mouth was wide open as they gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually stood still and successfully ascended the nineteenth step, standing at the same level as Jiang Taixu.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, who had been sitting cross-legged on the 19th step without any movement, suddenly opened his eyes. Two sharp lights flashed in his eyes.</p><p>A trace of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t seem to expect that the person who climbed the 19th step would be a young man from mo Shang. It was a young man he didn’t know.</p><p>However, what was even more shocking was that after Lu Ming reached the 19th step, he did not seem to have any intention of stopping. He looked at the 20th step.</p><p>“Heavens, is he going to reach the 20th step?”</p><p>it can’t be. That’s the 20th step. Not many people have ever made it. Only the top 20 on the list of top 1000 talents made it when they were at the martial King realm and the previous number one on the Heavenly King List made it to the 20th step. No one else has made it.</p><p>“Can he really do it? Even Jiang Taixu can’t get there.”</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>At this moment, the glint in Jiang Taixu’s eyes grew even more intense. He stood up and spoke into Lu Ming’s ears,”You want to climb the 20th step?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu had transmitted his voice to the others, so they could not hear him.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I advise you to stay on the 19th step!” Jiang Taixu continued to send messages.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes glowed even more sharply. this time, no one has managed to reach the 20th step. If you do, what will the other geniuses do? ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
