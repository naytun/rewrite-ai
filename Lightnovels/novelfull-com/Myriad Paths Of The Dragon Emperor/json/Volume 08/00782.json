It was even more majestic, and the power of the blood essence was even purer.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time, all of them surged towards the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>This time, the refinement took a day.</p><p>……</p><p>In a Palace of the Shangguan family, a terrifying aura and killing intent came out.</p><p>“What did you say? Jin Jue was killed. By that kid called Lu Ming?”</p><p>A deep roar sounded, containing endless anger.</p><p>The owner of the voice was Shangguan Zhongyuan, the Father of Shangguan Wu Chen and Shangguan Wu Ling, an elder with real power in the Shangguan family.</p><p>Shangguan Wu Chen, Shangguan Wu Ling, and a skinny man stood beside Shangguan Zhong Yuan. Their faces were pale, and they were sweating profusely.</p><p>They knew that Shangguan Zhongyuan was furious. He was extremely furious.</p><p>Shangguan jinjue was killed?</p><p>Among the Shangguan family’s younger generation, Shangguan jinjue was the second most powerful heaven’s favorite. There was only one person who was stronger than him.</p><p>The Shangguan family had high hopes for such a genius. In the future, he would definitely become the Shangguan family’s pillar of support. It was a pity that he had died just like that.</p><p>How could Shangguan Zhongyuan not be angry?</p><p>“Lu Ming, he must die!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Shangguan Zhongyuan uttered a cold sentence.</p><p>but father, there are people guarding the hundred venerated mountains. People over the age of 30 can’t enter at all. How can we kill that little bastard!</p><p>Shangguan wuchen said.</p><p>Among the younger generation of the Shangguan family, there was no one else who could compete with Lu Ming except for one person.</p><p>However, that person was cultivating in another Holy Land of a higher level and could not disturb him. Only the older generation could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the elders could not enter the hundred venerated mountains. Moreover, they did not dare to brazenly send their elders to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He could only do it secretly.</p><p>“He can’t possibly stay in the hundred venerated mountains forever, wait for him to come out!”</p><p>Shangguan Zhongyuan’s eyes were as cold as ice as he continued, ” send someone to monitor the hundred venerated mountains. Inform me immediately after that kid comes out!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The skinny man said.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated beside the long spear for an entire day before he managed to refine all the blood essence. However, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline had not advanced.</p><p>But this time, Lu Ming had a feeling. He felt that he was not far from the divine level.</p><p>It was a wonderful feeling. He could feel that the prison-suppressing stele was not far from being promoted.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Once the prison-suppressing stele was promoted to the divine level, his combat power would definitely be greatly improved.</p><p>Furthermore, it was said that there was an even more powerful use of the divine bloodline. It was not as simple as a burst of power. It would greatly increase one’s combat power.</p><p>The sovereigns who had awakened divine bloodlines were also known as divine level sovereigns.</p><p>According to the records, the top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents were all God-level talents.</p><p>In other words, the top 300 on the list of top 1000 talents had all awakened the third bloodline, which was a divine bloodline.</p><p>Without awakening a divine bloodline, there was no way he could compete with those geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a while. He took a deep breath and stood up.</p><p>He planned to leave this place and change to another place to cultivate.</p><p>“Brother, may I know your name?”</p><p>At this moment, a young man walked to Lu Ming’s side, cupped his fists and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>“This brother, I can see that your combat strength is strong and you are indeed a Dragon among men. I am interested in befriending you. I am Chu zhongxuan!”</p><p>The young man continued. His eyes were very pure, and he didn’t seem to have any other thoughts.</p><p>“Chu zhongxuan, 586th on the list of top 1000 talents?” Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Haha, it’s just a small name, it can’t be compared to you, brother!” Chu zhongxuan laughed.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Since Chu zhongxuan was so forthright, Lu Ming was not a pretentious person. He smiled.</p><p>could it be the strongest Esper on the Heavenly King List, Lu Ming? ”</p><p>Chu zhongxuan’s eyes moved as he said.</p><p>if there isn’t a second Lu Ming who also topped the Heavenly King ranking, it should be me!</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose and said.</p><p>no wonder brother Lu is so strong. With your combat power, you should be able to pass the tower of a hundred talents. You might even get a token to other higher cultivation Holy Lands.</p><p>Chu zhongxuan sighed.</p><p>“Tower of a hundred Supremes? A token that leads to a higher cultivation Holy Land?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>“It seems like brother Lu doesn’t know yet!”</p><p>Chu zhongxuan was a little surprised. He explained to Lu Ming briefly.</p><p>There were many cultivation sanctuaries in ninedragons, and the hundred venerates mountain was just one of them. It was just an ordinary one.</p><p>There were also some cultivation Holy Lands that were even more wondrous than the hundred venerated mountains, and the effects were even better.</p><p>However, some of those Holy Lands required a large amount of resources, so the number of people who could enter was extremely limited.</p><p>Some Holy Lands were only open to the top of the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>After all, resources were limited. They could only be given to stronger geniuses so that they could achieve better results in the battle of Providence.</p><p>It was said that the top 100 on the list of top 1000 talents had been sent to a secret place by Martial Emperor Di Yi to cultivate in seclusion, waiting for the battle of Providence.</p><p>If one wanted to enter a higher cultivation Holy Land, other than those famous and top-ranked heaven’s favorites, there was another way, and that was to obtain the qualifications.</p><p>In some ordinary cultivation Holy Lands, there would be some testing grounds.</p><p>For example, the hundred Supremes Pagoda in the hundred Supremes mountain.</p><p>As long as they passed it, there was a certain possibility of obtaining a token to a higher cultivation Holy Land.</p><p>Some of the geniuses who cultivated in the hundred Supremes mountain would often go to the hundred Supremes Pagoda.</p><p>“There’s actually such a place!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart palpitated.</p><p>The effects of the hundred venerated mountains were still quite good if one’s cultivation level was lower. However, as one’s cultivation level increased, the effects would become weaker and weaker. It would naturally be better if one could go to those more mysterious places to cultivate.</p><p>“Brother Lu, do you want to go? Why don’t we go together? I was planning to go and try it out!” Chu zhongxuan said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the two of them left the place.</p><p>Chu zhongxuan had been there before and was familiar with the way. He brought Lu Ming in the direction of the hundred venerated mountains.</p><p>A few hours later, a tall tower appeared in front of them.</p><p>It was a stone tower that occupied a large area and was so tall that it reached the clouds.</p><p>The two of them flew over and landed below the stone tower. There were a few other young men below the stone tower, and they all looked up.</p><p>Lu Ming also raised his head and looked up.</p><p>The stone tower had a total of ten levels.</p><p>At this moment, the first six floors were all shining with light, while the last four floors were pitch black.</p><p>On the way, Chu zhongxuan explained the situation of the tower of a hundred Supremes to Lu Ming.</p><p>The tower of a hundred talents did not test one’s cultivation, but the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>There were 10 levels in the tower of 100 Supremes. As long as one could make it to the ninth level, they would be able to obtain a token that would lead them to a higher cultivation Holy Land.</p><p>Every time he passed a level, the tower of a hundred talents would light up.</p><p>At this moment, the first six floors were lit up, indicating that someone had made it to the sixth floor.</p><p>At this moment, the light on the seventh floor also suddenly lit up.</p><p>Luan Xiongfei has already reached the seventh floor. Could he possibly reach the eighth floor? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. However, the hundred-battle intent realm of the Luan family is indeed terrifying!</p><p>Under the tower of a hundred Supremes, the others were discussing in low voices.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
