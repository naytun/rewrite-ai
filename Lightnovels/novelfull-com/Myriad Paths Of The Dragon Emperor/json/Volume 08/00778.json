Who was he?</p><p>In Miao Yi’s long and narrow eyes, a vicious glint flickered as he spat out in a cold voice, kid, it seems that you still don’t understand what I mean. Regardless of whether this place belongs to my Miao family or not, I am the one who said it. It is me, Miao Yi, who said it. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Miao Yi still had his hands behind his back, looking high and mighty.</p><p>His words were very simple. Regardless of whether this place belonged to the Miao family or not, since he, Miao Yi, had made the decision, Lu Ming had to give him face. If he said that he would occupy this place, then he would occupy it.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. How good was Miao Yi’s ego?</p><p>“You? Miao Yi? What dogshit? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to wave his hands.</p><p>The others were even more shocked. Lu Ming completely did not take Miao Yi seriously.</p><p>In the hundred venerated mountains, there were not many who dared to speak to Miao Yi in such a manner.</p><p>There were many holy places for cultivation in ninedragons, and the hundred venerates mountain was only one of them, and it was not a high-level one.</p><p>There were even more advanced and mysterious cultivation Holy Lands. There were even inheritances left behind by Supreme martial artists and even Dao fields of Emperor path experts. The hundred venerated mountains simply couldn’t compare to them.</p><p>However, if one wanted to enter such a sacred place to cultivate, one would need to be qualified. Miao Yi did not have that qualification yet.</p><p>Some of the more powerful heaven’s favorites would cultivate in those sacred grounds. In the hundred venerated mountains, Miao Yi was considered one of the more famous heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Small … Zi, you will regret your words!”</p><p>The killing intent in Miao Yi’s eyes became even colder. A green light jumped out from his body, covering the sky and the earth as it spread out.</p><p>Lu Ming actually said that he was dogshit and told him to get lost?</p><p>Who was he? He was ranked 501st on the list of top 1000 talents, and he was the son of the Miao family.</p><p>On this dragon vein, the Wang family was the most powerful. Under the Wang family, there were three major forces. The Shangguan family was one of them, and the Miao family was the other.</p><p>Even the heaven’s favorites who ranked higher than him didn’t dare to talk to him like that. Who does this kid think he is?</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight. What’s with all this nonsense? I still need to cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Miao Yi indifferently.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>On Miao Yi’s body, a green light shot into the sky, emitting a terrifying corrosive aura.</p><p>it’s the poison intent! Retreat!</p><p>The other young men’s expressions changed drastically, and they quickly retreated, their faces filled with fear.</p><p>poison concept, interesting!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>There were thousands of concepts in the world, but it was Lu Ming’s first time encountering the concept of poison.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>With a wave of his hands, a green ray of light mixed with the concept of extreme poison transformed into a green centipede that pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Peak second level of the spiritual ocean tier!”</p><p>The moment Miao Yi made his move, Lu Ming realized that Miao Yi’s cultivation was at the peak of the second level of the spiritual ocean tier, which was more than a level higher than his.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. The terrifying force of the exploding star fist pierced through the void and headed toward the green centipede.</p><p>??…</p><p>When the fist force of the explosive star fist collided with the green centipede, a terrifying scene appeared. The fist force actually produced a sizzling sound and was rapidly corroded by the green light.</p><p>The concept of extreme poison was actually corroding the fist force.</p><p>haha, my toxic concept can corrode everything. Even true essence and force can be corroded. You’re only at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm, and you still dare to fight me? die!</p><p>Miao Yi sneered, and the mist around his body became even thicker. With a palm strike, another green centipede pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky rumbled four times in a row as the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps were used. A violent force surged out.</p><p>The two venomous centipedes were split apart.</p><p>“You have some ability. Heavenly Phoenix sky devouring palm!”</p><p>Seeing that the two centipedes had been dispersed by Lu Ming, Miao Yi’s face darkened. His palms turned dark green, and they seemed to be covered with lines. Those were the silhouettes of the centipedes.</p><p>The surging palm print blasted out with a powerful corrosive power, causing the space to emit a sizzling sound.</p><p>Miao Yi’s concept of extreme poison was a headache for many people. Many who were stronger than him were not willing to face him.</p><p>However, he had encountered Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The three intents of wind, fire, and Thunder fused and exploded as he struck his palm forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Miao Yi’s palm print was split apart, but it immediately turned into a green mist that spread out and enveloped Lu Ming. This was a poisonous mist that was filled with strong corrosive properties.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline and a powerful devouring force burst out from his left palm. The poisonous mist was devoured by the nine Dragon bloodline as soon as it got close to Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure dashed past Miao Yi, a long spear appearing in his hand. The dazzling Spear’s gleam pierced towards Miao Yi.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Miao Yi’s expression changed drastically. Lu Ming was actually not afraid of his poisonous concept and was charging straight at him.</p><p>His figure turned into a series of afterimages in an instant as he rapidly retreated. In the next moment, a cold light bloomed from Miao Yi’s hands, and he aimed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Wind concept!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. Miao Yi had actually comprehended the concept of wind and had also reached level two.</p><p>However, Miao Yi’s wind concept did not successfully merge with his poison concept.</p><p>A ray of cold light was aimed at Lu Ming’s neck.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the cold light collided with a loud bang, and the cold light was bounced away.</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming could see clearly that the cold light was not a knife or a sword, but a centipede made of metal. This centipede was similar to a soft whip, but it was more mysterious. It could grow, break, turn, and its attacks were unpredictable.</p><p>On both sides, there were dense centipede legs. They were as sharp as blades and made a sharp whistling sound as they streaked through the air.</p><p>Shua shua …</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Miao Yi’s centipede-like weapon streaked across the air and headed straight for Lu Ming. Its position was constantly changing, and it let out an ear-piercing screech.</p><p>With the concept of wind activated, Lu Ming’s figure changed rapidly, avoiding the centipede’s attack and charging towards Miao Yi.</p><p>“True dragon Strike!”</p><p>The long spear thrust out, and a three-colored true dragon roared as it pounced towards Miao Yi.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had comprehended the fourth intent realm, he had yet to integrate it into the dragon God’s three absolutes. Therefore, his attack was still tri-colored.</p><p>When Lu Ming fused the earth concept into the dragon God’s three absolutes, the three absolutes would undergo a transformation and become a demigod-level martial arts technique.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming would try it when he had the time but he had not succeeded.</p><p>Miao Yi’s expression changed, and he quickly retracted his centipede weapon, bombarding it towards the three-colored true dragon.</p><p>With a loud explosion, Miao Yi’s body trembled as he was forced to retreat.</p><p>Miao Yi, ranked 501st on the list of top 1000 talents, was indeed powerful. He could easily defeat those of a higher realm. With his poison intent, even ordinary martial artists at the peak of the fourth level spiritual ocean realm were not his match.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
