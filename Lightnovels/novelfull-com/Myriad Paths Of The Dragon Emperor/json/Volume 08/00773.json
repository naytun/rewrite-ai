They looked at Lu Ming and the rest in horror.</p><p>...</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the audience, in the wind sword sect’s area, ye FA’s body seemed to have been drained of all strength as he slumped in his chair.</p><p>His eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>The wind sword sect was finished.</p><p>The Qinghe twin monsters that he had paid a huge price to invite had died in battle, and the wind sword sect’s patriarch had been killed. The wind sword sect’s competition had ended here.</p><p>Originally, they only needed to win two more rounds to get into the top six and obtain at least three slots. But now, there was no hope at all.</p><p>They had already been eliminated.</p><p>All his plans and arrangements were in vain.</p><p>This wasn’t the most important thing. The most important thing was that the wind sword sect’s patriarch had been killed, and two experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier had also been killed. The wind sword sect’s strength had plummeted, and they had completely become the weakest of all the factions around Grand gathering city.</p><p>In the future, how could the wind sword sect compete with the other powers? they were destined to decline.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming and the few of them. No, it was all because of ruan Tingting.</p><p>Ye FA’s eyes turned to the sea Cloud sect and saw ruan Tingting’s figure.</p><p>It was all because of this woman. They were the ones who first sacrificed ruan Tingting’s happiness and wanted to marry her to the two monsters of Qinghe, which led to all this.</p><p>Then, he remembered that when he proposed to marry ruan Tingting to the Twin monsters of Qing He, ruan Tingting had said that she could ask a few friends to help the wind sword sect participate in the competition.</p><p>Her few friends were undoubtedly Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Unfortunately, he did not believe it at all. Not only did he reject ruan Tingting, but he also offended Lu Ming and the others and asked them to go to the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect was just a small force, but it was so glorious because of the addition of Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>And all of this should have belonged to the wind sword sect.</p><p>If Lu Ming and the rest joined in, there would be no need for the two monsters of the clear river sect. In addition to the wind sword sect’s own strength, they would have a high chance of winning.</p><p>Unfortunately, everything was just an ‘if’. Everything had been destroyed by him.</p><p>Ye FA’s mouth was filled with bitterness. He regretted it, but he knew that there was no turning back.</p><p>Ye Qing’s eyes were also in a daze. She had never expected this outcome. The strength of Lu Ming and the rest had exceeded her expectations.</p><p>She knew that she would never be able to take revenge in this lifetime. Lu Ming and the rest were not on the same level as her. They were not in the same world.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect’s area was the complete opposite of the wind sword sect’s.</p><p>It was a jubilant atmosphere, and Qiao long even laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>“Tingting, look! Lu Ming and the rest killed the Qing He twin monsters!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan tightly held onto ruan Tingting’s hand.</p><p>Ruan Tingting’s eyes were filled with gratitude.</p><p>She knew that Lu Ming and the rest were doing this for her.</p><p>thank you all. I will work hard to cultivate. I will personally settle the rest!</p><p>Ruan Tingting whispered.</p><p>On the side, the iron bone sect and the Crimson Moon sect, the two forces that had fought against the sea Cloud sect, were rejoicing in their hearts. However, they were also filled with lingering fear. They had actually looked down on the sea Cloud sect and Lu Ming’s group.</p><p>They were clearly top-tier heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“We admit defeat, we admit defeat!”</p><p>In the fighting ring, Xie nianqing retracted his sky demon force field and the remaining four people started shouting madly.</p><p>However, no one was paying attention to them anymore. Almost everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming, Kong Jin, and Xie nianqing.</p><p>They knew that Xie nianqing wasn’t to be trifled with. He actually controlled six experts by himself, making them unable to even call out to admit defeat. Then, with a light wave of his hand, he dealt with two experts at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier. His methods were simply unpredictable and chilling.</p><p>The other six people from the sea Cloud sect looked at each other and smiled bitterly.</p><p>They understood that they were only here to make up the numbers. They had nothing to do with this competition.</p><p>“The sea Cloud sect wins!”</p><p>The judge announced the result.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his seat and continued to refine the blood essence.</p><p>She had devoured all the blood essence of the five wind sword sect disciples who had been killed.</p><p>This time, the blood essence was even denser and more terrifying.</p><p>Two were at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and three were at the third level.</p><p>Lu Ming refined it with all his might to upgrade the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>However, the original nine forces had become eight. The wind sword sect had been eliminated in advance, and they were no longer able to fight.</p><p>The rest of the competition was much simpler. After seeing how terrifying Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin were, the other forces would admit defeat when they encountered the sea Cloud sect.</p><p>The intentionless mansion and the sea Cloud sect had always won.</p><p>When the ranking battle was about to end, Lu Ming’s blood essence had been completely refined.</p><p>However, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele showed no signs of advancing.</p><p>Lu Ming was clear that it would not be that easy. However, he was not too disappointed.</p><p>Whether it was a coincidence or the judge’s intention, the battle between intentionless mansion and Sea Cloud sect was left to the end.</p><p>“Intentionless mansion against Sea Cloud sect!”</p><p>When the judge said this, everyone’s spirits were lifted.</p><p>Intentionless mansion had not fought a single battle in the ranking battle and had won all of them until now.</p><p>No one knew how strong the battle power of the intentionless mansion was.</p><p>On the surface, the intentionless mansion had two fourth level spiritual ocean tier cultivators, one of whom was at the late fourth level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>But they must have invited outside help.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect had fought two battles and had won all of them until now.</p><p>In the battle between the two forces, who was stronger? Everyone was very curious.</p><p>With a flash, both parties ascended the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin stood at the front while the other six stood behind them.</p><p>They knew that they were only here to make up the numbers. They only needed to defend well. They didn’t want to achieve anything, but they wanted to avoid any mistakes.</p><p>“I truly admire the three of you for having such battle prowess despite being so young!”</p><p>An elegant old man walked out of intentionless mansion and said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two did not speak. They looked at the old man and waited for him to continue.</p><p>“How about this, let’s just treat this battle as a sparring session and not harm our lives?”</p><p>The elegant old man continued.</p><p>This elegant elder was the patriarch of the intentionless mansion. He was obviously afraid of Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. They had no grudges with the intentionless mansion. There was no need to take their lives.</p><p>“That’s good! Get into formation!”</p><p>After the elegant elder finished speaking, the nine people from intentionless mansion moved and formed a large formation. A terrifying aura burst out.</p><p>five experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and even a peak fourth level spiritual ocean tier expert!</p><p>As soon as the aura of the nine people from intentionless mansion burst out, there were cries of alarm from the surroundings.</p><p>The intentionless mansion was indeed powerful. They actually had five experts at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. Compared to them, the other forces were far too lacking.</p><p>The remaining four people were all at the peak third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>A battle formation set up by a few people together was extremely terrifying. Who could break it?</p><p>“Interesting, let’s join forces!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>haha, let’s have a good fight. I haven’t had a good fight today!</p><p>Kong Jin laughed and strode forward.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing made the first move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
