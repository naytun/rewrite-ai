He’s gone far!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted Kong Jin’s shoulder when he saw that he was still staring in the direction where ruan Tingting had left.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you, fatty, would be so loyal.”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted.</p><p>“Of course, don’t you know who I am?”</p><p>A lamb leg had appeared in Kong Jin’s hand, and he began to gnaw on it.</p><p>“Didn’t you want me to introduce Xiao Qing’s sister to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered to the fatty.</p><p>Fatty’s body immediately straightened, and his eyes shone brightly. of course, I have to introduce her. Tingting is Tingting, but miss Xiao Qing’s sister is her sister. They’re different.</p><p>“Shameless! The two of them are shameless, jackals of the same tribe!”</p><p>Xie nianqing chided and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Fatty chuckled and asked while gnawing on the leg of lamb, ” “Lu Ming, where are we going now? I definitely can’t go to the hundred venerated mountains.”</p><p>“Let’s go to the blood pool first and save brother Jian! Little Qing, fatty, you guys didn’t take part in the tower of a hundred talents “assessment, did you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The tower of a hundred Supremes?”</p><p>Xie nianqing and fatty were both confused.</p><p>if you pass the test of the tower of a hundred Supremes, you will be able to obtain a token that will lead you to a higher cultivation Holy Land. With your talents, it will not be a problem for you to pass the test. We will return to the hundred Supremes mountain first. After you have obtained the token, we will go to the blood pool together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Not only could the blood pool heal Jian feiliu, but they could also accumulate the power of their bloodline in preparation for awakening a third bloodline.</p><p>“Go back to the hundred venerated mountains? do you want to go back in disguise?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys should stop chatting. You’re in danger.”</p><p>Dandan suddenly said.</p><p>The few of them were shocked.</p><p>“Dandan, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“As soon as you left the hundred venerated mountains, you were targeted. I guess it won’t be long before some experts come to kill you!”</p><p>Dandan said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Dandan’s senses were very strong. He should be right.</p><p>Who was that? They had been targeted as soon as they left the hundred venerated mountains. Could it be that they were from the Wang clan or the Luan clan?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, they flew toward a vast mountain.</p><p>Not long after, they landed in a Valley. Lu Ming began to inscribe runes in the valley. The runes sank into the ground one after another.</p><p>A few minutes later, a light screen flashed and enveloped them inside.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming inscribed an array that concealed their auras for himself, Xie nianqing, and fatty to completely conceal their auras.</p><p>this is an illusory formation. From the outside, we can’t be seen at all. We can only see a pile of rubble. I’d like to see who wants to deal with us!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Not long after, there was a whistling sound and at least a dozen figures flew over.</p><p>These people were dressed in black robes and looked rather old. They were definitely not young.</p><p>They stopped above the valley and looked around.</p><p>“They should be coming this way. What’s going on? This time, we can’t let them get away! They have to die for killing our Shangguan clan’s chosen warrior!”</p><p>also, the elders have instructed us to do it discreetly. We can’t let anyone find out. We’ll do it secretly!</p><p>An old voice filled with cold killing intent could be heard.</p><p>After that, the dozen of them split into several groups and chased in different directions.</p><p>so, it’s the Shangguan family!</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>After beating up the young, the old would come and assassinate them in the dark. This was the style of the great aristocratic families. They were really despicable and shameless.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you going to do?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>since they’re coming, I’ll take them all out at once. I’m short of spiritual crystals anyway!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>“Haha, that’s what I like!” Kong Jin laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started to inscribe a large inscription formation on the spot. At first, he inscribed a few illusionary formations that covered the entire Valley. Then, he began to inscribe killing formations.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming spent a day to inscribe twelve level-six formations in the valley. Among them, the sword whistling Thunder formation was the main one.</p><p>with the current strength of my mental energy fire, I’m still unable to completely inscribe the sword howling Thunder formation. However, those people from the Shangguan clan have the highest cultivation, which should be at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm. It’s enough to kill a seventh level spiritual ocean realm expert!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“Let’s get them to come over now!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming dispelled the array that concealed their aura and the illusory array that enveloped them. The three of them were instantly exposed in the valley.</p><p>After that, the three of them sat down cross-legged in the valley and began to cultivate. Powerful auras burst out without any concealment.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles away, a few black-robed men were flying.</p><p>“What’s going on? we’ve been searching for so long, but we still haven’t found those little brats. Where did they go? could it be that they’ve already left this place?”</p><p>Someone growled.</p><p>hold your horses. According to the aura detected by the formation plate, they should be in this area. Let’s continue our search!</p><p>The leader of the group said in an old voice.</p><p>At this moment, the leading old man suddenly stopped.</p><p>“There’s a reaction!”</p><p>The old man was holding an array disc in his hand. At this moment, there was a spot glowing on the array disc.</p><p>“Gather the others!”</p><p>The leading old man said.</p><p>Soon, more than a dozen people gathered from all directions. They flew in the direction of Lu Ming and the others at top speed. Not long after, they appeared above the valley where Lu Ming and the others were.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin suddenly opened their eyes. They seemed to be ‘surprised’ and stood up one after another.</p><p>“Everyone, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked insincerely.</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>The old man in the lead said.</p><p>“Kill us? Who are you people?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. Xie nianqing and Kong Jin also pretended that their expressions had changed.</p><p>hehe, you don’t have to ask about this. Go to hell and find out. You guys, go and kill them!</p><p>The old man waved his hand and the three black-robed men charged down. Their auras exploded and they launched a frenzied attack on Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>However, the three of them didn’t activate their bloodlines, as if they didn’t want to expose their identities.</p><p>The three of them were all at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier, and their combat strength was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“That old man is really cautious!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>It was obvious that the old man in the lead had sent out three people to test the waters.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin stood together. They did not seek to achieve any merits, but they did not want to make any mistakes. They resisted with all their might.</p><p>Now was not the time to activate the big array. What Lu Ming wanted was to wipe them all out.</p><p>With the three of them working together and cooperating with each other, three experts at the sixth level of the spiritual ocean tier couldn’t break through their defense at all.</p><p>The six of them were locked in a battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
