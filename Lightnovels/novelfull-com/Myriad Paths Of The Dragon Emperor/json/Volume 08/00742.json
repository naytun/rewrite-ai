He had to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>His goal was to become the strongest Esper, the number one. How could he be stopped by Lu Ming at the beginning?</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s entire body turned into divine weapons that could destroy anything.</p><p>Lu Ming combined the two second-level concepts of wind and thunder, in addition to his powerful essential core, and used the explosive star fist to fight Jiang Taixu.</p><p>The two of them turned into two beams of light and kept bombarding each other. It was extremely terrifying. The nearby mountains were destroyed and the earth cracked. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>Outside, it was silent. Everyone held their breath and watched with wide eyes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Jiang Taixu had exchanged more than fifty moves.</p><p>“Heavens, what kind of combat strength is this? it’s too terrifying, is he still in the king’s realm?”</p><p>with such battle prowess, even a normal first level spiritual ocean tier martial artist wouldn’t be able to withstand a few moves and would be killed. It’s too terrifying.</p><p>peerless talents! They’re peerless talents! Once they break through to the spirit sea realm, they’ll advance by leaps and bounds. They might even be able to compete with the top 300 or even the top 200 in the battle of Providence!</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>If someone like Jiang Taixu, who had entered the ten Heavenly Kings three years ago, had broken through to the spiritual ocean realm earlier, he would probably have entered the top 300 in the ranking.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Jiang Taixu exchanged more than a dozen moves in a row and shattered a mountain peak. The two of them stood in the void.</p><p>In Jiang Taixu’s eyes, other than shock, there was also murderous intent and anger.</p><p>He did not expect that he would be stopped by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of weapons vibrating could be heard. A huge mountain appeared above Jiang Taixu’s head. The mountain was made of bare rocks and was filled with all kinds of weapons.</p><p>The nine silver chakras were extremely bright. It was Jiang Taixu’s bloodline.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu waved his hand and the countless weapons on the mountain flew into his body. His aura became stronger and his skin even glowed with a metallic luster.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He stepped on the void and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>it seems that he has finally used his strongest combat power. That’s good. It’s time to end this battle!</p><p>break! Lu Ming said softly. The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline erupted. Lu Ming stepped forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven art!</p><p>There seemed to be a prison-suppressing stele in his palm, suppressing the nine nether nether prison with supreme power.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm and Jiang Taixu’s palm collided. The space where the two exchanged blows trembled violently, creating water-like ripples that spread in all directions.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a figure rapidly retreating.</p><p>The retreating figure was Jiang Taixu. One of his arms was trembling, and his palm was even a little twisted.</p><p>The people who saw this scene could not believe their eyes.</p><p>The ancient Jiang family cultivated the immemorial divine weapon technique, and their bodies were even tougher than spiritual weapons. Every move they made contained boundless power that could destroy everything.</p><p>However, in a head-on confrontation, he was actually suppressed by Lu Ming. His palm was injured and he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared at the sky in disbelief.</p><p>“What’s impossible? you’re strong, I’m stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and continued to attack.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must die!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu let out a long howl and attacked again.</p><p>However, after a few moves, he was forced to retreat. His arms were severely deformed, and even his bone armor was shattered. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p>In the outside world, everyone was shocked.</p><p>Not only had Lu Ming defeated Jiang Taixu, but he was also going to kill him.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was a rare talent of the Jiang family. In the future, he had the potential to compete for the throne of the Jiang family’s successor. Lu Ming actually wanted to kill him. How bold.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jiang Taixu was no match for Lu Ming. He was sent flying by Lu Ming and coughed up blood. At least seven or eight of the bone armor on his body was broken.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you dare to kill me, the Jiang family will not let you off!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared.</p><p>haha, the chosen warrior of the Jiang family, an ancient family. You lost, and you still have the nerve to use your family name to suppress me? now that the battle of Kismet is approaching, do the elders of your Jiang family dare to attack me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed without fear.</p><p>For a large family like the Jiang family, if the disciples behind them lost in a fight with their peers, their elders would not take action, because they would not have the face to do so.</p><p>The competition in the big clans was even more brutal.</p><p>Not only did they have to compete with their own kind, but they also had to compete with the geniuses of other forces. Only then would they have the qualifications to inherit the clan.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu roared and retreated frantically, trying to escape.</p><p>Escape. He had to. He had to escape and gather all the other powerhouses of the Jiang family in the world of the Heavenly King’s monument to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave chase. He had always been decisive. Since he had offended them, he would kill them.</p><p>“Young master Taixu, run! We’ll stop him!”</p><p>Three sharp lights suddenly flew over from the distance and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>They were three old men, like three divine weapons, extremely terrifying.</p><p>Without a doubt, they were the three powerful old monsters of the Jiang family.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was overjoyed. He performed a secret skill and fled forward madly.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He instantly struck out with his palms and kicked out.</p><p>The three old men were sent flying backward, coughing up large mouthfuls of blood. Their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Each of the three of them had cultivated the immemorial divine weapon technique for more than five hundred years. They were definitely top experts among peak-tier Kings. They could kill a large number of ordinary peak-tier Kings with a wave of their hands.</p><p>However, despite the three of them joining forces, they were still attacked by Lu Ming until they vomited blood.</p><p>&Nbsp; it was too terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and flashed past like a Phantom. He struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the elders was torn into pieces and all his stele Qi went to Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, his figure did not stop and he continued to kill. Soon, the other two old men also followed in his footsteps.</p><p>Each of the three elders had close to a hundred Qi. In this way, Lu Ming’s Qi had skyrocketed to more than four hundred.</p><p>“It’s a pity that Jiang Taixu ran away!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he looked in the direction where Jiang Taixu had fled.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Taixu had already disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. He continued to search for prey while refining the blood essence.</p><p>The energy of the blood essence was all transferred to the second bloodline.</p><p>Since the higher the level of the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline, the more powerful the prison-suppressing heavenly technique would be, Lu Ming decided to upgrade the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline first.</p><p>In the outside world, countless people were shocked.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, the most promising genius who was most likely to win the first place, had been defeated so early.</p><p>In the end, the three elders risked their lives to stop Lu Ming and they managed to escape. It was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
