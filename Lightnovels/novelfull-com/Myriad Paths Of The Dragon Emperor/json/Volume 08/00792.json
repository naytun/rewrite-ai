No, I’ll make your friend suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>...</p><p>Wang Haotian’s eyes glinted coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry about me. My Junior Sister is dead and my cultivation has been crippled. I’m already a cripple. Don’t worry about me!”</p><p>Jian feiliu shouted.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Wang Kong grabbed Jian feiliu’s shoulder with his claw. A cracking sound came from Jian feiliu’s shoulder as the bone armor was broken. However, Jian feiliu just gritted his teeth and didn’t make a sound.</p><p>“Damn it, this group of scum, damn it!”</p><p>At the entrance of the cave, Kong Jin roared,</p><p>Giggle …</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. A wave of anger rushed to his mind and his eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>Kong Jin was right. These people deserved to die. He could not wait to go out and kill them.</p><p>But now, he had to endure it. He had the injured Xie nianqing and ruan Tingting behind him. If he acted rashly, he would only end up killing everyone.</p><p>When Luan Feng Yun had first arrived, he had said that Di Tian’s Imperial Guards would come here a day later. Perhaps, once they arrived, things would take a turn for the better.</p><p>Just now, Luan Fengyun had not sent a voice transmission. Perhaps he had been too confident and felt that there was no need to hide anything. With him around, he could take ruan Tingting away without even needing a day.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had to think of a way to stall for one day.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll ask you again. Are you going to change or not?”</p><p>Wang Haotian said.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly, his eyes extremely cold. His voice was icy cold. Wang Haotian, Wang Kong, if you dare to use Jian feiliu again, I will kill you!</p><p>“You dare to threaten me?”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s face turned cold. He suddenly turned around and pointed his finger. A stream of energy shot out and pierced a big hole in Jian feiliu’s shoulder. Blood stained Jian feiliu’s clothes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exploded with a violent aura and cold killing intent.</p><p>No one noticed that Lu Ming’s footsteps were moving slowly. With every step he took, an inscription would sink into the ground.</p><p>you want to use me to threaten Lu Ming? in your dreams! In your dreams!</p><p>At this moment, Jian feiliu suddenly roared. A faint red light spread out from his spine.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Wang Kong’s expression changed.</p><p>“Don’t!” Lu Ming roared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Jian feiliu’s spine suddenly exploded, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Jian feiliu had performed some kind of secret skill to self-destruct his bloodline power.</p><p>This move was also beyond Wang Haotian and Wang Kong’s expectations.</p><p>The self-destruction of one’s bloodline power was equivalent to losing one’s life.</p><p>Jian feiliu spat out a mouthful of blood. He looked at Lu Ming and said, ” brother Lu, it’s my honor to be friends with you. However, my Junior Sister is dead and my cultivation has been destroyed. There’s no point in me staying in this world. It’s a pity that I won’t be able to see the day when brother Lu rules the world!</p><p>As he spoke, Jian feiliu’s vitality became weaker and weaker, and he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>Then, his life force was exterminated.</p><p>Jian feiliu, the proud Son of Heaven who had once dominated golden sand island under the name of King of Hell and fought with Lu Ming, had fallen.</p><p>Although he had not known Lu Ming for a long time, Jian feiliu was a man of true character and treated people with sincerity. Lu Ming had already treated him as a good friend. Now, in order not to threaten Lu Ming, Jian feiliu had self-destructed his Blood Meridian and died.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura burst out violently, and his killing intent seemed to materialize.</p><p>brother Jian, don’t worry. I’ll definitely send Wang Haotian and Wang Kong down to accompany you. I’ll also send the rest of the Wang family down to hell sooner or later!</p><p>He stared at Wang Haotian and Wang Kong with cold and emotionless eyes.</p><p>For some reason, Wang Haotian and Wang Kong felt a chill in their hearts when they saw Lu Ming’s eyes. It was as if the god of death was staring at them.</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>Wang Kong took a deep breath and threw Jian feiliu’s body on the ground.</p><p>hehe, Wang Haotian, it looks like you’ve lost your bargaining chip. How about this? let’s attack together, kill these guys, and take that woman!</p><p>Luan Fengyun said with a cold smile.</p><p>“I alone am enough to kill them!”</p><p>Wang Haotian said coldly, his eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, he stepped forward.</p><p>He had to kill Lu Ming today. He had a bad feeling. It was as if he would die in Lu Ming’s hands sooner or later if Lu Ming did not die. This feeling was very unpleasant.</p><p>Purple flames burst out of Wang Haotian’s body. The terrifying heat exploded and the air within a radius of dozens of meters was instantly burned up, turning into a vacuum.</p><p>A long spear made of flames appeared in Wang Haotian’s hand. It turned into a ray of light and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The scorching flame was still dozens of meters away from Lu Ming, as if it was going to set his clothes and hair on fire.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The true element in his entire body burst forth. At the same time, four types of intent surrounded him as he struck out with his palm.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The blazing flames spread in all directions, and the earth rumbled and cracked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure retreated continuously. With every step he took, runes would flash and sink into the ground when his feet stepped on the ground.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a heavy sigh of relief, suppressing the surging qi and blood in his body. He felt a sharp pain in his palm.</p><p>His palm had turned black from the scorching flames. Wang Haotian’s combat strength was terrifying.</p><p>Wang Haotian was also at the peak fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. He had cultivated the sky-burning flames to an extremely deep level.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Wang Haotian pushed Lu Ming back with one strike. He waved the flame spear and continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and his figure moved to the side rapidly.</p><p>“Do you think it’s that easy to leave? Die!”</p><p>Two suns appeared in Wang Haotian’s eyes as he continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm again, clashing with Wang Haotian. With a boom, he was pushed back a dozen more steps, blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming is so powerful. He took two moves from Wang Haotian in a row!</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were shocked.</p><p>Wang Haotian was a quasi-god level prodigy. He had unparalleled combat strength and could kill anyone with a higher cultivation level than him in seconds. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was two levels lower than his, yet he was able to withstand a few moves. It was terrifying.</p><p>On the side, Luan Fengyun’s eyes flickered, and he was also extremely surprised.</p><p>Wang Haotian was shocked as well.</p><p>this person must die. Otherwise, I might really be the one to die in the future!</p><p>Wang Haotian roared in his heart. His killing intent grew stronger. Flames appeared above his head. His bloodline erupted, and his power grew.</p><p>The flame spear turned into a terrifying killing weapon, burning the void and heading for Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Inscriptions started to flash on his body.</p><p>There were runes that could burst out with true essence, runes that could increase one’s speed, runes that could increase one’s defense …</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming inscribed eight inscription arrays for himself.</p><p>“An inscription master!”</p><p>Wang Haotian’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took a step forward.</p><p>In an instant, the ground glowed brightly and countless beautiful inscriptions appeared, forming a large inscription formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
