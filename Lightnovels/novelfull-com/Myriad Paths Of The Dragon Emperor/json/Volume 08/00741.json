Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as the dozen refined corpses exploded. Lu Ming strode toward the corpse Qi elder.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The old man was shocked. More than a dozen indestructible refined corpses had been blown up by Lu Ming. How could Lu Ming’s attack be so terrifying?</p><p>His heart trembled.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The old man roared in his heart. He wanted to escape, but it was too late. The explosive fist radiance drowned him in an instant. The next moment, three streams of stele Qi flew into Lu Ming’s Heavenly King stele illusion.</p><p>On the other side, the ghostly old man was almost scared out of his wits as he frantically fled.</p><p>A spear ray pierced through the void and nailed him in the air.</p><p>Outside, many people gasped when they saw the scene on the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>this Lu Ming is too terrifying. Two extremely powerful old monsters of the sky corpse sect were killed by him as easily as breaking dead branches. The difference is too great. He completely crushed them!</p><p>“In my opinion, Lu Ming’s combat strength has already reached the peak of that level. He’s not much different from Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and the others. He can even compete with them.”</p><p>terrifying, truly terrifying!</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s combat strength had shocked everyone.</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Hao waved his hand, and the scene changed again.</p><p>Following that, as time passed, they would occasionally see the strong fight against each other.</p><p>Some of the powerhouses who had been thought highly of and had the hope of making it into the top 108 also clashed.</p><p>Some died in battle, some fled with serious injuries.</p><p>The most eye-catching ones were some young geniuses.</p><p>Needless to say, Jiang Taixu, Wang Jue, and the others, who had been part of the ten Heavenly Kings in the previous generation, were known for their strong combat strength.</p><p>On top of that, Xie nianqing, fatty Kong Jin, corpse King, and the other newly risen heaven’s favorites were also extremely powerful. Many powerhouses died at their hands.</p><p>With the addition of Lu Ming, there was no doubt that the top ten would be born from these people.</p><p>Time flew by, and half a day had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gains were getting bigger and bigger. He already had one hundred and fifty traces of stele Qi in his Heavenly King stele’s illusionary shadow.</p><p>“Look, Jiang Taixu and Lu Ming seem to be getting closer and closer. They’ll meet soon!”</p><p>Someone suddenly called out from outside.</p><p>Dongfang Hao and adept three corpses seemed to want the crowd to see them clearly as well. They switched between the images of Lu Ming and Jiang Taixu. The crowd saw that the two of them were flying towards each other and seemed to be getting closer and closer. They would meet soon.</p><p>Everyone’s heart began to race. Could it be that these two heaven’s favorites are going to meet so soon?</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to what would happen when the two of them met.</p><p>Lu Ming flew forward at top speed, looking for prey.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes narrowed as a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>Jiang Taixu!</p><p>Jiang Taixu strolled in the air and discovered Lu Ming. His eyes gleamed sharply and a powerful aura bloomed from his body.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re unlucky to have met me. If you obediently let me take your monument Qi, you might still have a chance to live!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu stood in front of Lu Ming and spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Oh, really? I also want your monument Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming licked his lips and said.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s projection of the Heavenly King stele definitely had more than two hundred traces of stele Qi. Lu Ming was very tempted.</p><p>haha, you want my stele Qi? you really don’t know the immensity of heaven and earth. Let me tell you, the higher you climb on the Heavenly King stele’s steps, the stronger your combat power is. So be it. Today, let me kill you and let the world know what a true heaven’s pride is!</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes were full of killing intent. The sharp Qi around him grew stronger, like a peerless divine weapon that could cut through everything.</p><p>Back then, on the steps of the Heavenly King’s tablet, Jiang Taixu had warned Lu Ming not to step onto the 20th step but Lu Ming had ignored him.</p><p>Who was he, Jiang Taixu? He was actually ignored by Lu Ming. At that moment, he already had the intention to kill Lu Ming. Now that he had met him, how could he let Lu Ming off?</p><p>it’s said that the Jiang family cultivates a God-level cultivation technique, the immemorial divine weapon technique. I’d like to experience it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>Jiang Taixu was one of the most powerful kings. He was curious about what level he was at.</p><p>“The war is about to start!”</p><p>In the outside world, everyone was also excited as they stared at the screen above.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming and Jiang Taixu had encountered each other. Judging from the situation, a battle was about to break out.</p><p>They were looking forward to this battle.</p><p>“Who do you think will win the battle between Lu Ming and Jiang Taixu?”</p><p>in my opinion, it’s most likely Jiang Taixu. After all, he’s a veteran powerhouse. Three years ago, he was already extremely terrifying. In the past three years, he must be even more terrifying and his combat strength has become stronger. His goal is to aim for the first place on the Heavenly King ranking!</p><p>“That’s right. Although Lu Ming is a peerless genius with terrifying potential and talent, he’s still a little weak. He can’t be Jiang Taixu’s opponent. What’s important now is how many moves he can take from Jiang Taixu and whether he’ll be killed!”</p><p>The crowd was in an intense discussion.</p><p>Within the heavenly stele’s world.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing came from Jiang Taixu’s body. A terrible sharp Qi exuded from him, which could tear everything apart.</p><p>“You will see it, but the price is death!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu stepped out and struck his palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s eyes, this palm was like a heavenly blade that could split everything.</p><p>His essential core exploded and Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Violent true essence gathered in this fist and exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with Jiang Taixu’s palm. A dull boom rang out between heaven and earth. Both of their bodies trembled and retreated.</p><p>Jiang Taixu, fight with me. No need to test me. Just give it your all!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright.</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, it was as if thousands of weapons were clattering in unison. Jiang Taixu’s aura was even sharper and more terrifying.</p><p>“Shattering intent!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Jiang Taixu’s intent realm was the shattering intent realm. It was an extremely terrifying intent realm. Like Xie nianqing’s destruction intent realm, it was more of an offensive intent realm. Its destructive power was extremely terrifying and could destroy everything.</p><p>Moreover, Jiang Taixu had already cultivated the shattering will to an extremely terrifying level-level two lower tier.</p><p>Yes, Jiang Taixu’s shattering will had reached level two lower tier.</p><p>Coupled with the immemorial divine weapon technique that Jiang Taixu had cultivated, the combination of these two techniques was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jiang Taixu bellowed as he strolled forward. He swung his arm like a sword and slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>The fusion of the wind and thunder concepts erupted. The war Dragon true element circulated rapidly as Lu Ming threw another punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying tremor was heard. The ground kept exploding under the bombardment of the terrifying Qi, and huge pits appeared.</p><p>The two figures trembled for a moment before they steadied themselves.</p><p>that Lu Ming is so powerful. He could actually block Jiang Taixu!</p><p>The people who were watching from the outside were extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength had exceeded their expectations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
