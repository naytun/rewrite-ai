He was ranked 432nd on the list of top 1000 talents, and was even more powerful than Shangguan jinjue.</p><p>Obviously, Luan Xiongfei had already reached the seventh floor.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent Sonic Boom came from the sky. A scorching aura spread towards Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Everyone looked back and saw a burly figure in the sky flying toward them at an extreme speed. His body was covered in purple flames, like a Purple Sun.</p><p>“It’s the Wang family’s sky-burning flames!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the person approached the hundred Supremes Pagoda, but he had no intention of slowing down. His entire body was like a meteorite, smashing towards them.</p><p>“Not good, Dodge!”</p><p>The others were shocked and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and stood still.</p><p>“Haha, get lost!”</p><p>The Wang family member laughed and smashed down.</p><p>“Brother Lu, get out of the way!”</p><p>Chu zhongxuan pulled Lu Ming to the side.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Wang family members stomped heavily on the spot where Lu Ming had been standing. The earth rumbled, gravel flew, and cracks appeared on the ground.</p><p>“Wang Kong! It’s Wang Kong!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Wang Kong, 430th on the list of top 1000 talents, was one rank higher than Luan Xiongfei.</p><p>Wang Kong landed on the ground and cast an unfriendly glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming did not want to Dodge and that made him a little unhappy.</p><p>“The Wang clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He thought of Jian feiliu.</p><p>Jian feiliu should have arrived in ninedragons. He wondered if he had gone to the Wang family. If he had the chance, he must find the Wang family and ask them about it.</p><p>hehe, that guy, Luan Xiongfei, actually made it to the seventh level. It seems like his hundred battle intent has improved a little. However, I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to make it to the eighth level!</p><p>Wang Kong chuckled.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, a ray of light flashed on the seventh floor. A figure appeared and was bounced out.</p><p>It was a burly young man. He was wearing armor and exuded a powerful fighting will.</p><p>“Hehe, Luan Xiongfei, it seems like you have failed!”</p><p>Wang Kong sneered.</p><p>“Wang Kong, I’ve failed. You might not be better than me!”</p><p>After saying this much, Luan Xiongfei didn’t stay any longer, and soared into the sky and left this place.</p><p>After Luan Xiongfei came out, all the lights in the tower of a hundred Supremes had been extinguished, which meant that there was no one inside.</p><p>Wang Kong snorted and strode toward the first floor of the tower.</p><p>There was a light door at the bottom of the first floor of the tower of a hundred Supremes. Wang Kong disappeared after he stepped through it.</p><p>“Brother Lu, let’s go and have a try!”</p><p>Chu zhongxuan said.</p><p>Many people could enter the tower of a hundred talents at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped into the light door with Chu zhongxuan. At the same time, a few other people also stepped into the light door.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered the door of light, he appeared on a platform.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>As soon as he entered, Lu Ming realized that the essential core in his body could not be circulated at all. Even his mental energy fire could not be circulated. He could only erupt with the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A flaming saber was formed and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This flaming saber was formed by the fire concept, which was equivalent to the early stage of the beginning of level two.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming’s concept of fire burst out and condensed into a long spear of flames, which he stabbed at the flaming saber.</p><p>With a bang, the flaming saber was destroyed.</p><p>A door of light appeared in front of the platform.</p><p>“This first stage is really easy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the door of light. The next moment, he appeared on another platform.</p><p>At this time, if one were to look from the outside of the tower of a hundred Supremes, they could see that three floors had already lit up, indicating that someone had made it to the third floor.</p><p>This time, another flaming saber was formed on the platform. However, the fire concept contained in this flaming saber had already reached the peak of the second level.</p><p>It was on par with Lu Ming’s current flame concept.</p><p>Lu Ming only cast a kind of flame concept and condensed a long spear to fight against the flaming saber.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The spear and the saber kept clashing, and the sound of metal clashing could be heard.</p><p>it’s purely a battle of intent. Not bad. This can temper my intent and make it stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and focused on controlling the concept of fire to fight against the flaming saber.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current concept of fire was at the peak of the second-level beginner, which was equivalent to the flaming saber. The two of them kept clashing.</p><p>At this time, five floors of the tower of a hundred Supremes had already lit up. This meant that someone had made it to the fifth floor.</p><p>what a fast speed! That should be Wang Kong. He has already reached the fifth floor. I wonder if he can make it to the ninth floor.</p><p>the ninth floor is unlikely. Even Luan Xiongfei has only made it to the seventh floor. I think Wang Kong will most likely be stuck there as well.</p><p>There were still a few people watching and discussing under the tower.</p><p>Lu Ming burst out with the concept of fire and fought with the flaming saber. After more than a hundred rounds of fighting, Lu Ming felt that he was becoming more and more familiar with the use of the concept of fire. His long spear danced and he had the upper hand. After a few moves, he defeated the flaming saber.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s fire concept had not broken through the bottleneck and reached level two lower tier, he felt that it was one step closer.</p><p>After destroying the flaming saber, another door of light appeared in front of him. Lu Ming stepped into it and the next moment, he appeared on the platform of the third level.</p><p>This time, a golden combat sword appeared. It was formed by the metal mentality, and it had reached the initial completion of level two mentality.</p><p>It seemed that the will that appeared in the tower of a hundred Supremes was random, and it was not fixed on a specific will.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Golden combat sword was incomparably sharp as it stabbed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming released two concepts.</p><p>The two intents of Wind and Fire combined to form a long spear. After a few moves, it destroyed the huge golden sword.</p><p>Lu Ming continued and entered the fourth level.</p><p>On the fourth level, it was still a golden sword, but the strength of the metal mentality had reached the peak of level two lower tier.</p><p>Lu Ming used the Wind and Fire concepts to fight. After exchanging dozens of moves, he defeated the golden sword and entered the fifth level.</p><p>And at this time, there were already people who failed to pass the round and were ejected.</p><p>The seventh floor also lit up at this moment.</p><p>Someone had made it to the seventh level.</p><p>At the bottom of the tower, the others raised their heads to see if the eighth floor would light up.</p><p>However, after a while, the seventh level flashed and a figure flew out.</p><p>It was Wang Kong!</p><p>“Damn it, just a little bit more and I’ll be able to make it to the eighth level!” Wang Kong growled.</p><p>As soon as Wang Kong came out, he saw that the light on the seventh floor of the tower was extinguished, but the lower six floors were still lit.</p><p>In less than two minutes, there was a flash of light on the sixth floor and a figure appeared. It was Chu zhongxuan. He had made it to the sixth floor and was ejected.</p><p>The light on the sixth floor was extinguished, but the five floors below were still lit.</p><p>“There’s still someone on the fifth floor!”</p><p>Wang Kong looked at the tower of a hundred Supremes but did not leave.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was on the fifth level.</p><p>A green ring appeared on the fifth level. It was condensed by the wind concept and had reached the stage of level two upper tier.</p><p>Lu Ming still only unleashed two intents-Wind and Fire. He tried his best to resist, but he was completely at a disadvantage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in a hurry. This way, he could train the Wind and Fire concepts, especially the wind concept. He could also use it as a reference.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
