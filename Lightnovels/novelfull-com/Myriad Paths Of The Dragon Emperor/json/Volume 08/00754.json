His spirit sea had doubled in size and could accommodate more essential core.</p><p>...</p><p>Of course, when Lu Ming refilled his spirit sea, he had used another two hundred raw gemstones.</p><p>This time, if it wasn’t for Kong Jin’s 100 raw gemstones and Xie nianqing’s 200 raw gemstones, he wouldn’t have had enough spiritual crystals.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the platform on the highest level of the Supreme shrine, Lu Ming was cultivating the prison-suppressing heaven technique.</p><p>His hands, feet, even his shoulders and waist seemed to contain a prison-suppressing stele. His every move suppressed everything and had unimaginable power.</p><p>Lu Ming only stopped after more than a hundred moves.</p><p>“After reaching the spiritual ocean tier, I can finally use the prison suppressing heavenly art as I wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>The prison-suppressing heaven technique was a demigod-level bloodline martial technique. The amount of vital essence it consumed was too terrifying. When he was a peak-tier King, Lu Ming did not dare to use it casually and had to control it.</p><p>After breaking through to the spirit sea realm, he no longer had this concern. In the spirit sea, his vital essence was extremely abundant and it was completely sufficient. In addition, all four intents had reached level two. Lu Ming did not know what level his combat strength had reached.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming comprehended four concepts every day and cultivated martial arts techniques.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that Xie nianqing and the rest should be almost done with their cultivation, so he left the Supreme shrine.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that something was amiss the moment he stepped out of the Supreme shrine.</p><p>He had only sensed two auras, but there were originally three.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As if sensing Lu Ming’s aura, Xie nianqing and Kong Jin appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Jian feiliu seems to have left!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Brother Jian has left?” Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He had inscribed an inscription formation. If someone barged in from the outside, he would be able to sense it. However, if one went out from the inside, he would not be able to sense it.</p><p>“He sent me this information!”</p><p>Xie nianqing passed a Jade voice transmission talisman to Lu Ming.</p><p>There was only one sentence in it,”miss Xie, brother Lu, I have something to do. I’ll leave first. Don’t miss me!”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that he had not received any news from Jian feiliu because he was in the Supreme shrine and Jian feiliu could not send any messages.</p><p>“Brother Jian, what happened for you to leave in such a hurry? Why did you leave without saying goodbye?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>With his understanding of Jian feiliu, he wouldn’t have left without saying goodbye. Something must have happened.</p><p>“I’m guessing it’s because of his Junior Sister.”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“It’s possible. Did brother Jian go to ninedragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. This was the only possibility.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the city and see if we can get some information.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, the three of them rose into the air and flew toward the city near the Heavenly King monument.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a city.</p><p>Now, most of the peak-tier Kings from all over the world had left. The area around the Heavenly King monument had returned to its previous desolation. There were not many people on the streets.</p><p>The three of them found a restaurant to see if they could get any information.</p><p>Kong Jin ordered 50 roasted lamb legs from the restaurant. According to him, they were to be stored.</p><p>I heard that all the geniuses and sovereigns have gone to ninedragons in the sky martial region.</p><p>“That’s normal. There’s still more than a year before the battle of Providence. Every time it happens, the Empyrean heaven divine Palace will place great importance on it. I heard that all the cultivation sanctuaries in ninedragons have been opened up. All the cultivation sanctuaries that were closed in the past are now open to the geniuses. Naturally, those geniuses will flock there.”</p><p>not only the Emperor sky divine Palace, but also the sky demon Valley, the heavenly corpse sect, and so on. Every time the battle of Providence is near, all kinds of Holy Lands will be opened to increase the strength of the geniuses as soon as possible. After all, the battle of Providence will affect the luck of a force for the next twenty years. It’s no small matter. Even the Martial Emperor places great importance on it!</p><p>that’s right. Those sovereigns will naturally become stronger and stronger if they cultivate in such a Holy Land. All the sovereigns who are interested in the battle of Providence will not miss it and will go. Otherwise, they will only be surpassed by others. Right now, ninedragons is the gathering place of the wind and clouds!</p><p>In the restaurant, some people were discussing the recent news.</p><p>Lu Ming, they’re right. Before every battle of Providence, the major forces will do everything they can to cultivate their geniuses and open up various Holy Lands. This is also an opportunity for us to improve our abilities quickly and compete with those top-ranked geniuses on the list of top 1000 talents!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Let’s go to ninedragons. I have a friend there.”</p><p>Kong Jin said as he gnawed on the leg of lamb.</p><p>Lu Ming was thinking rapidly in his heart.</p><p>The nine Dragons city in the sky martial region was where the main palace of the Emperor heaven divine Palace was located.</p><p>Martial Emperor Diyi was there. He was heading to ninedragons, which was very close to Martial Emperor Diyi.</p><p>He was afraid that Martial Emperor Di Yi would sense his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>senior Jiuyang has already been sealed. He said that he wouldn’t be detected for ten years, so he should be fine. At that time, I’ll try not to use the bloodline of the nine Dragons, so there shouldn’t be a problem. If I’m always timid and don’t grasp opportunities, how can I quickly improve my cultivation? ”</p><p>At this thought, Lu Ming decided to go.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll set off in a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After a while, the three of them finished eating and flew toward the West.</p><p>They were going to the nearby region to take the inter-province transportation formation.</p><p>……</p><p>In the sky martial region, ninedragons was known as the largest city in the eastern barren territory.</p><p>Ninedragons. It was called ninedragons because it was made up of nine huge dragon veins.</p><p>Each dragon vein was actually a mountain range. It was vast and stretched for tens of millions of miles, winding around the vast land.</p><p>Among them, there were six dragon veins that were in different directions.</p><p>At the center of these six dragon veins were the other three dragon veins. The three dragon veins converged together, forming the core of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>Around the nine dragon veins were city walls.</p><p>However, this city wall was not an ordinary city wall. It was made up of countless mountain peaks, which were more than 10000 meters high. They gathered together and formed a circle, surrounding the nine dragon veins in the middle, forming the nine Dragons city.</p><p>Ninelongs city was unbelievably huge. It was almost as big as the Tianxuan region.</p><p>That’s right, a city was equivalent to a large region. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>From this, one could see how magnificent the city wall surrounding Nine Dragons city was. It was made up of many mountains, which was simply incredible. Obviously, it was not the creation of heaven and earth. It was said that it was built by the Supreme Master in the ancient times.</p><p>Pulling out countless mountains from the ground and surrounding the nine dragon veins, what a vast project it was!</p><p>Lu Ming stood outside the city walls of ninedragons, dumbstruck at the sight.</p><p>He found it hard to believe that such a shocking building existed in this world. Was this even possible with human strength?</p><p>Even a Martial Emperor can’t do it, right?</p><p>He believed that a force Emperor could pull out a 10000-M high mountain from the ground; but how many were there?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
