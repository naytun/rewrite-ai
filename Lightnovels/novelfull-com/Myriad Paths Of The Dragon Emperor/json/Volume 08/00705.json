His eyes were filled with a strong murderous intent.</p><p>...</p><p>“The blood poison sect’s sect master!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>The white-haired elder in front of him was the blood poison sect’s sect master. He was the one who had injured him and tried to steal his Jade sword. He didn’t expect to meet him here.</p><p>hahaha, little bastard, I said before that I would kill you if I met you. You’re really unlucky to have met me here. I’ll see how you die this time.</p><p>Zhong Yuan laughed and stood up from the table, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>A martial artist at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm was too powerful. He was a whole lot stronger than a martial artist at the third level of the spiritual ocean realm. His aura was like a vast ocean, suppressing Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Zhong Yuan stepped forward, causing the ground to rumble.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Chi Yue stepped forward and stood in front of Lu Ming. Her face turned cold and she glared at Zhong Yuan.</p><p>“So it’s miss Chi Yue. Miss Chi Yue, please move aside. This person has a grudge with me, I must kill him!”</p><p>Zhong Yuan said coldly.</p><p>“No, this is the red leopard tribe. You are not allowed to fight!”</p><p>Chi Yue said coldly.</p><p>“Miss Chi Yue, you’d better step aside. This time, I’ve promised you that I’ll go to the holy mountain to participate in the assessment. However, if I don’t kill this person, don’t blame me for not doing my best during the assessment.”</p><p>Zhong Yuan sneered. Anyone could tell that this was a threat.</p><p>Among the hundred odd people who came to the red leopard tribe this time, Zhong Yuan’s cultivation was the strongest. He had reached the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm and was the most promising candidate among all the candidates in the red leopard tribe.</p><p>These few days, the people of the red leopard tribe had been very polite to him. They had treated him as a distinguished guest, so he naturally had the confidence.</p><p>“I want him dead!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, Zhong Yuan was stunned for a moment before he burst out laughing.</p><p>The other two elders at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier also laughed.</p><p>haha, this brat is a peak-tier King tier. Has he gone mad? he actually wants brother Zhong to die? where does he get his confidence from? ”</p><p>“Could he have said this to miss Chi Yue and the others? That’s even more ridiculous, does he think I’m more important than brother Zhong? The young man can’t recognize himself. How pitiful and lamentable!”</p><p>The two elders at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier laughed out loud, their voices filled with mockery.</p><p>But the next moment, their smiles came to an abrupt end.</p><p>It was because Chi Yue looked at Lu Ming and said,”are you serious?”</p><p>“Yes! I must kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming was resolute and decisive.</p><p>alright, if little brother Lu wants to kill him, I’ll do it!</p><p>let’s go! the red leopard clan elder said from the side. With a wave of his hand, a huge leopard puppet appeared, emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p>Seventh level spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>This cheetah had an aura equivalent to the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm, and the strength of that aura made people’s hearts palpitate and make them despair.</p><p>Zhong Yuan was dumbfounded. He looked at the red leopard clan elder with a pale face and screamed, ” “What are you guys doing? This kid is only a martial King. I’m countless times stronger than him. Only I have a chance in the holy mountain’s assessment. You should kill him, kill him!”</p><p>“Little brother Lu is our red leopard tribe’s benefactor. What did he say? The red leopard tribe will do our best to satisfy him. Whoever he says he will kill, he will kill. Now, die!”</p><p>The red leopard clan elder shouted coldly. The cheetah puppet let out a long roar and pounced towards Zhong Yuan at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“No, no, how could this be? I’m not convinced!”</p><p>Zhong Yuan roared hysterically as he tried his best to resist.</p><p>But the difference between a puppet at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm and a puppet at the seventh level of the spiritual ocean realm was too great.</p><p>The cheetah puppet’s claw tore through all of Zhong Yuan’s defenses and attacks before tearing his body into two.</p><p>The sect master of the blood poison sect, an Almighty expert at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, an expert whose name shook the chaotic Astral Ocean, had died just like that.</p><p>He died in an extremely aggrieved manner. He didn’t even know why he died. Why did the red leopard tribe listen to Lu Ming?</p><p>The two third level spiritual ocean realm old men looked at this scene with their mouths agape, and they almost bit off their own tongues.</p><p>Then, the two of them looked at Lu Ming while trembling. Their backs were drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>The red leopard tribe actually listened to Lu Ming. With just one word from Lu Ming, an elder of the red leopard tribe made a move and killed Zhong Yuan in one move.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>They had all lived for more than a thousand years, but now they found that their brains were completely unable to understand.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and reached out to grab Zhong Yuan’s storage ring. He also devoured Zhong Yuan’s blood essence.</p><p>Then, he looked at the two sea of soul realm old men and said in a cold voice, ” you’ve lived for thousands of years, but you can’t even understand the situation. How pitiful and lamentable.</p><p>The two old men’s faces were completely red, and they were too ashamed to show their faces.</p><p>These were the words that they had given to Lu Ming just now. However, it had only been a short while and Lu Ming had returned the words to them in full.</p><p>Every word of his was like a slap to their faces.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored them. With Chi Yue leading the way, he checked the place. Unfortunately, Xie nianqing and Jian feiliu were not here.</p><p>“Miss Chi Yue, I need a room to cultivate in seclusion!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Zhong Yuan was at the fourth level of the spiritual ocean realm, and the power of his blood essence was too strong. He needed to go into seclusion to refine it.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Chi Yue brought Lu Ming to the core area of the red leopard tribe and arranged a room for him.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the room and entered the Supreme shrine. He began to refine the blood essence.</p><p>He had used all his blood essence to improve the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>The stronger the bloodline of the prison suppressing stele, the stronger the power of the prison suppressing heavenly technique.</p><p>The ninth silver chakra became brighter and brighter. In the end, it was as bright as the other nine chakra.</p><p>The peak of the ninth level of the king realm.</p><p>However, it was too difficult for a peak ninth level King to attain divine level bloodline. After Lu Ming refined all of Zhong Yuan’s blood essence, he had a feeling that he was still a long way from attaining divine level.</p><p>He did not know how much more blood essence he would have to consume before he could advance to the divine level.</p><p>Half a day had passed. Lu Ming walked out of the room.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re done with your seclusion?”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming came out, he saw Chi Yue.</p><p>“You’ve been waiting for me?” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Not really, I just got here. Do you want to walk around?”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>no, I’ll go to 10000 snakes Valley to hunt for poisonous snakes. How do I get there? ” Lu Ming shook his head and said.</p><p>I’ll Take You There. That’s the yin snake tribe’s territory. If we bring too many people, we’ll attract their attention. How about just the two of us go? ”</p><p>Chi Yue said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded. The two of them left the stone city and headed west.</p><p>The 10,000 Snake Valley was 30000 miles West of the red leopard tribe. It was the yin snake tribe’s territory.</p><p>It was said that this place used to belong to the red leopard tribe a few decades ago. Later on, the red leopard tribe lost a large piece of land, and the 10000 snakes Valley area fell into the hands of the yin snake tribe.</p><p>Riding on the puppet, the two of them arrived in less than half a day.</p><p>This was also underground. If it was outside the ground, Lu Ming would not need half a day to travel thirty thousand miles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
