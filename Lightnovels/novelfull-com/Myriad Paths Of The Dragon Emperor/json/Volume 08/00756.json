Do you think we can stay at your wind sword sect for a while? ”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at ruan Tingting with wide eyes.</p><p>“Isn’t there an Inn?” Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“There is an Inn, but it’s not convenient for cultivation. It’s not as comfortable as your place. My two friends are geniuses. Isn’t it better for us to discuss martial arts?”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at ruan Tingting with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming felt contempt in his heart. This fatty must be trying to take the opportunity to get close to ruan Tingting. He wanted to be in a favorable position and enjoy the moonlight first.</p><p>“I say, fatty, little Qing’s sister …”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately spoke and prolonged his voice.</p><p>ah, ahem, what Xiao Qing’s sister? I don’t know her. Tingting, what do you think of my suggestion just now? ”</p><p>Kong Jin instantly changed the topic.</p><p>Ruan Tingting pondered for a moment and said, ” alright then. My courtyard is quite big. It’s fine if I add the three of you. But fatty, you’re not allowed to cause trouble.</p><p>Kong Jin was overjoyed. He immediately swore to the heavens that he would not.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. This fatty was really a weirdo.</p><p>However, having a place to stay was better than staying in an Inn. Lu Ming naturally would not reject it.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and the other two followed ruan Tingting out of the Grand gathering city and flew towards the West.</p><p>Ten thousand miles away, there was a mountain range. The spirit Qi here was even denser than in Grand gathering city. On top of the mountain range, there were many palaces and courtyards.</p><p>This was the sect that ruan Tingting was in, the wind sword sect.</p><p>The wind sword sect was just a small force in ninedragons. There were no more than ten spiritual ocean tier martial artists in the sect, and the highest cultivation was only at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>Such a force would be unrivaled in the Tianxuan region, but in ninedragons, it was a small force.</p><p>However, according to ruan Tingting’s introduction, the wind sword sect was considered to be one of the top forces in the dozen or so surrounding Grand gathering city.</p><p>With ruan Tingting leading the way, the wind sword sect disciples did not stop them. They entered the wind sword sect and arrived at the courtyard where ruan Tingting was staying.</p><p>There were five rooms in ruan Tingting’s courtyard, so it was quite convenient for a few people to live in.</p><p>fatty, brother Lu, miss Xie, you guys can stay here from now on. However, don’t wander around the wind sword sect. There are some forbidden areas that I don’t even dare to enter. If I’m caught, I’ll be punished.</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, lady ruan, we know that!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming and the other two stayed there.</p><p>Ninedragons was too big and had countless forces. He wanted to get familiar with it first.</p><p>In the next two days, Lu Ming had a rough understanding of the forces in this area.</p><p>In the middle of ninedragons, three dragon veins converged. This was where Martial Emperor Di Yi and the higher-ups of the Emperor heaven divine Palace lived.</p><p>There were six dragon veins in the surroundings, with the six ancient families as the main force and countless forces scattered around.</p><p>Those cultivation Holy Lands were basically above the nine dragon veins.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to cultivate in those Holy Lands. One had to be recommended by the local palaces or by the forces in ninedragons.</p><p>It seemed that it would not be easy to enter those Holy Lands to cultivate.</p><p>On the third day, a clamor came from outside and Lu Ming walked out of the room.</p><p>At the entrance of the courtyard, a young man was swaggering in.</p><p>sullo, this is my courtyard. What do you mean by barging in? get out immediately!</p><p>Ruan Tingting stood in front of the young man and said loudly.</p><p>“Your courtyard? Don’t forget that this is the wind sword sect. Do you know your crime for bringing an outsider in?”</p><p>Su Luo’s face was cold as he swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>they’re my friends. It’s reasonable for me to let them stay in my courtyard for a few days. What’s wrong with that? sullo, you’re the one who’s guilty for barging into my courtyard without my permission. Now, get out!</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“Hmph, a slut is a slut. She actually brought a few men to live together.”</p><p>Sullo said coldly.</p><p>nest, where did this wild dog come from? you’re barking here. Be careful, I’ll tear your mouth apart!</p><p>Kong Jin carried his battle axe and walked over, staring at sullo with an unfriendly look.</p><p>“Fat pig, what did you say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Sullo’s eyes were cold, and his powerful aura rose up, enveloping Kong Jin.</p><p>The aura of a peak-tier King.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura also rose from ruan Tingting’s body. She was also a peak-tier King. She took a step forward and stood in front of Kong Jin, blocking su Luo’s aura.</p><p>In a place like ninedragons, it wasn’t difficult to become a peak-tier King. As long as one’s talent wasn’t bad, and with the support of a huge amount of resources, it wouldn’t be a problem to become a peak-tier King.</p><p>Of course, most of them were ordinary peak-tier Kings. They couldn’t make the list of top 1000 talents because they didn’t have enough battle strength or potential.</p><p>“Ruan Tingting, you want to fight me for a few outsiders?” Sullo’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Get out!” Ruan Tingting said coldly.</p><p>Alright, alright, damn fat pig. And you guys better be careful!</p><p>Su Luo glanced at Kong Jin and then at Lu Ming and Lu Li. He snorted coldly and turned to leave. He seemed to be quite afraid of ruan Tingting.</p><p>“Tingting, why are you blocking me? Let me tear that guy’s stinky mouth apart!”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at the door with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>fatty, don’t brag. You’re so ignorant and incompetent all day long, and you still think you can beat sullo? he’s a peak-tier King. Be careful, or you’ll be beaten into a dead fat pig.</p><p>also, Lu Ming, miss Xie, if I’m not around in the future, don’t wander around the wind sword sect. Sullo is a narrow-minded person. If they see you, I’m afraid they’ll deal with you.</p><p>Ruan Tingting warned.</p><p>Looking at ruan Tingting’s serious expression, Lu Ming was really speechless.</p><p>Were they so weak in her eyes that they couldn’t even deal with sullo?</p><p>It must be that Kong Jin’s impression in ruan Tingting’s heart was too bad.</p><p>“Tingting, why is that guy targeting you?” Kong Jin asked.</p><p>“He wanted to pursue me in the past, but I rejected him. That’s why he’s been targeting me ever since.” Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>Hmph, he’s like a Toad lusting after a Swan’s flesh. Tingting, your Ideal Husband is a handsome and extraordinary hero like me.</p><p>Kong Jin patted his chest with a triumphant look.</p><p>“Shameless!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting glared at Kong Jin and then said to Lu Ming and the rest, I have something to do and need to go out for a while. You guys must not wander around the wind sword sect!</p><p>Ruan Tingting jogged out of the room after giving him some more instructions.</p><p>“I say, fatty, you’ve never revealed your cultivation in front of miss Tingting before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“No, I originally wanted to use my handsome and unruly appearance to conquer her. What do you think? Do you guys think I have a chance?”</p><p>Kong Jin’s small eyes were wide open as he looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing with a hopeful look.</p><p>“You’re shameless!”</p><p>Xie nianqing left these words and returned to his room to cultivate.</p><p>“You’d better use your cultivation to conquer her!”</p><p>Lu Ming patted Kong Jin’s shoulder, turned around, and walked into the room.</p><p>“Hey, what’s the meaning of this? Make it clear!” Kong Jin shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
