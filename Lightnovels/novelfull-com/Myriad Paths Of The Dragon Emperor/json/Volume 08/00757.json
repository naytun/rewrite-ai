After a while, another kind of flame suddenly appeared between his brows. It was a blue flame.</p><p>The blue mental energy fire represented that Lu Ming’s inscription Dao had already reached level six.</p><p>“A rank 6 Alchemist!” He exclaimed.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. Through his inner vision, he saw a spirit lamp in his sea of consciousness. It was shining with a Blue Spirit Fire, gorgeous and beautiful.</p><p>Lu Ming’s inscription Dao had long reached the limit of the fifth level. After this period of cultivation, he finally broke through and reached the sixth level.</p><p>A level six inscriber was equivalent to a spiritual ocean tier cultivator.</p><p>“Now, I can take a look at the seal left behind by master.”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the mental energy fire and directed it towards the seal left by Lian Cang.</p><p>The seal left by Lian Cang was easily broken.</p><p>When the Dao of inscription was at level five, it couldn’t be opened, but at level six, it was easily opened.</p><p>It contained all the experiences and insights of a rank 6 Alchemist left by Lian Cang.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he had obtained a treasure. He started to comprehend and cultivate.</p><p>Two days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Fatty, Lu Ming, miss Xie, you guys stay here for a few days. I have something to do and will be out for a few days.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said to Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“Tingting, you’re going out for a few days. Where are you going?” Kong Jin asked.</p><p>“Nothing much? I need a few days to complete a mission issued by the sect!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>“A mission? Bring me along. Lu Ming, do you guys want to go?”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had been here for a few days. Lu Ming wanted to go out and have a look around to understand the situation.</p><p>“You guys want to go together? I’m telling you, this mission has a certain degree of danger!” Ruan Tingting said.</p><p>if there’s danger, then all the more we have to go. Tingting, don’t worry, I’ll protect you.</p><p>Kong Jin seized the opportunity to please him.</p><p>Ruan Tingting pondered for a moment. you guys can go if you want. But don’t run around. You have to stay by my side.</p><p>“Okay, okay, no problem, I’ll definitely be by your side!”</p><p>Kong Jin immediately agreed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not say much. They followed ruan Tingting out of the wind sword sect and arrived outside of Grand gathering city.</p><p>This time, the main mission was to kill a peak fifth level demonic beast, the Black Devil venomous Scorpion. The location was in a dark swamp more than three hundred thousand li away from Grand gathering city.</p><p>According to ruan Tingting, the dark swamp was filled with poisonous things and was very dangerous. Therefore, she had called a few of her good friends to go with her.</p><p>Her good friends were not from the wind sword sect, but from other forces.</p><p>Outside of Grand gathering city, Lu Ming and the rest saw two other young men, a man and a woman.</p><p>The woman was very beautiful and was about the same age as ruan Tingting. The man was also quite handsome.</p><p>Through ruan Tingting’s introduction, Lu Ming and the rest found out that the woman’s name was Qiao Xuan. She was a disciple of the sea Cloud sect, another sect near Grand gathering city.</p><p>The man’s name was Shi Kai, and he was also a disciple of the Shi family, one of the forces in Grand gathering city.</p><p>“Tingting, who are they?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan looked at Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Kong Jin curiously.</p><p>haha, nice to meet you, beautiful. I’m Kong Jin! Kong Jin was the first to greet Qiao Xuan. His small eyes scanned Qiao Xuan’s body up and down, and they were shining brightly.</p><p>“This damn fatty, he’s just like you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing whispered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately pulled a long face.</p><p>Injustice, he was greatly wronged. When did he become as lecherous as Kong Jin, staring at every beautiful woman he saw?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting glared at Kong Jin and ignored him. She introduced him to Qiao Xuan, ” “This is Lu Ming, and this is miss Xie nianqing.”</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Xuanxuan, you know Lu Ming?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting asked.</p><p>I don’t know him, but this name is very familiar. I think I’ve heard it before.</p><p>Qiao Xuan’s brows furrowed.</p><p>“It’s probably someone with the same name. There are many people with the same name in the world!” Ruan Tingting said, not minding it.</p><p>Qiao Xuan glanced at Lu Ming and nodded. Then, the group of them flew in the direction of dark swamp.</p><p>It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the 300000 li mark.</p><p>Ahead of them was the dark swamp.</p><p>“You guys have to be careful later, don’t get lost.”</p><p>Ruan Tingting was worried and reminded him again.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. This lady had a good heart. However, no matter how he looked at it, she was too naive.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two naturally nodded.</p><p>Then, everyone ‘carefully’ flew in.</p><p>Not long after they flew in, there were many poisonous insects that pounced at them. However, their levels were not high and they were easily killed by ruan Tingting and the others.</p><p>Qiao Xuan and Shi Kai were both peak-tier Kings.</p><p>The dark swamp was huge, and the group had advanced for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>“We’re almost at the Black Devil Scorpion’s lair, be careful!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting said. Everyone retracted their auras and continued forward.</p><p>that’s the Black Ghost Scorpion! Kill!</p><p>In a swamp, he found a huge black poisonous Scorpion. Its entire body was black as if it was cast from steel.</p><p>This was the target of their trip, Black Ghost Scorpion.</p><p>die! ruan Tingting shouted and immediately charged at the Black Ghost. The Blue Sword light was crystal clear and enveloped The Black Scorpion.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>The Black Ghost venomous Scorpion let out a screech, and its black tail stabbed towards ruan Tingting like a Black Lightning.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of metal clashing rang out, and The Blue Sword light dissipated. Ruan Tingting’s figure could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Qiao Xuan shouted, and charged forward with Shi Kai.</p><p>Qiao Xuan used a soft whip, while Shi Kai used a large hammer. The two of them joined hands with ruan Tingting, and they continuously attacked the Black Devil Scorpion.</p><p>Although the Black Ghost venomous Scorpion was strong, it was still no match for the Joint Forces of three martial artists of the same level. Not long after, its black shell was cut open by ruan Tingting’s long sword, and black blood oozed out.</p><p>During this process, Lu Ming and the other two did not interfere.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Seeing that it couldn’t win, Black Ghost Scorpion turned around and ran madly in the swamp.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the other two quickly chased after Black Devil Scorpion.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and the three of them followed him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had covered thousands of miles.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just as the Black Ghost venomous Scorpion escaped to a mound, rays of light suddenly emanated from the mound, forming a combat sword. The sword slashed the Black Ghost venomous Scorpion, splitting it in half in the air.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Ruan Tingting and the others were shocked and couldn’t help but stop.</p><p>“A formation? Interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
