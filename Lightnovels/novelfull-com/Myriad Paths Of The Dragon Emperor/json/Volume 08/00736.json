It was a mocking smile.</p><p>...</p><p>He finally knew what Jiang Taixu meant.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s meaning was clear. He was already on the 19th step. If Lu Ming were to step onto the 20th step, where would he put his face?</p><p>He couldn’t step on it himself, yet he wanted to be high and mighty, taking the lead, and not let others step on it. What a joke.</p><p>Why would Lu Ming bother with such a person?</p><p>“If you have the ability, then come up!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and ignored Jiang Taixu. He turned around and took a step forward without hesitation.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped onto the second step, he felt as if the entire world was pressing down on him. His body could not help but stagger and tremble slightly, as if he would fall down at any time.</p><p>In the sky in front of him, Lu Ming saw a figure as high as the sky looking down at him. The pressure was even more terrifying and powerful.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The rumbling voice kept rushing into Lu Ming’s mind and soul.</p><p>Endless rays of light of various colors shot towards Lu Ming and struck his body. Lu Ming seemed to be experiencing a thousand cuts. One could clearly see his flesh and blood being separated.</p><p>Of course, this was only his own feeling. What others saw was only his body trembling slightly.</p><p>“He stepped on it, he stepped on it.”</p><p>“His body is trembling slightly. It seems to be very difficult. If he can hold his ground, he’ll be comparable to the top 20 on the list of top 1000 talents.”</p><p>the 20th step. This kid’s future is limitless.</p><p>Below, countless people widened their eyes. They looked up at Lu Ming in shock and nervousness.</p><p>“No one can make me roll down!”</p><p>On the 20th step, Lu Ming growled. His eyes were filled with determination and persistence.</p><p>He wanted to break through all obstacles. He wanted to reach the peak and surpass Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>In front of his eyes, a figure seemed to have appeared. It was indomitable, crossing the universe with an unparalleled aura. It was even larger and more majestic than the figure that had told him to ‘roll down’.</p><p>That was the Martial Emperor Di Yi He had imagined. He had even surpassed Martial Emperor Di Yi, so why would he be afraid of this figure?</p><p>His posture slowly stabilized, and his body stood straight.</p><p>He stood firmly on the 20th step.</p><p>The dark red stairs were up there.</p><p>Only those who had participated in the battle of the Heavenly King List and obtained the top 108 spots could step onto the dark red steps. Only those who had the protection of the monument Qi could step onto it. Otherwise, only death awaited them. There had never been an exception.</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Jiang Taixu’s eyes as he looked at Lu Ming, who was standing on the 20th step. His body glowed with a sharp light.</p><p>He looked at the 20th step with hesitation in his eyes, but he did not step on it.</p><p>At this moment, the people on the other steps opened their eyes and looked up at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>amazing, truly amazing. Another top-tier heaven’s favorite!</p><p>Many geniuses sighed.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you are indeed much stronger than me.” Jian feiliu sighed.</p><p>Qin Qingshan and Gao Qiang were also sighing.</p><p>Qin Qingshan had been easily defeated by Lu Ming a few days ago. At first, he was still indignant, but now, he was convinced.</p><p>As for Gao Qiang, he was extremely glad. Back then, he wanted to teach Lu Ming a lesson. Now, he was blushing as he imagined it.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>In the crowd below, Wang mie, Wang Mang, and the others roared in disbelief.</p><p>“This brat, I want him dead!”</p><p>Wang Mang’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>don’t worry, the higher one climbs on the Heavenly King stele’s steps, the stronger one’s combat power is. In the Heavenly King ranking battle, kill him!</p><p>Wang mie’s eyes flashed with cold light.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing, who had been sitting on the 18th step, suddenly stood up and walked up to the 19th step.</p><p>He stepped onto the 19th step steadily and stood at the same level as Jiang Taixu. Before anyone could react, Xie nianqing took another step.</p><p>With this step, she reached the 20th step. Her body trembled slightly, but her eyes were extremely determined.</p><p>Another person had reached the 20th step. Moreover, it was Lu Ming’s female companion. Almost everyone treated her as Lu Ming’s girlfriend.</p><p>A pair of Golden Boy and Jade girl had both stepped onto the 20th step. Everyone was stunned, thinking that they were dreaming.</p><p>This was too unbelievable.</p><p>This time, after the opening of the Heavenly King tablet, he had yet to step onto the 20th step? Now, there were two of them.</p><p>Jiang Taixu’s eyes turned even colder.</p><p>haha, it’s really lively today. Let me join in the fun!</p><p>A loud laugh was heard. Everyone looked over and saw a fat man with a waist as thick as a water tank. He wore a loose white robe and his face was chubby with a hint of red.</p><p>He was carrying an axe on his shoulder. The handle of the axe was two meters long, and the body of the axe was huge, like a door.</p><p>In his other hand, he was holding a greasy lamb leg and gnawing on it. As he gnawed, he descended and stepped on the steps of the Heavenly King tablet.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, on the other side, a rainbow light flashed and a tall figure landed under the Heavenly King tablet. This young man was wearing a gray robe and looked very ordinary. He was the kind of person who would be easily found in a sea of people.</p><p>He descended and strode up the stairs.</p><p>The fatty and the ordinary-looking young man climbed up the stairs very quickly. They reached the 11th step in no time, but they did not stop. They continued to climb up step by step.</p><p>17 steps, 18 steps, 19 steps.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded. Where did these two geniuses come from? they were too terrifying. They had climbed up the nineteenth step in one go and were now on the same level as Jiang Taixu.</p><p>nest, this place is really uncomfortable. It hurts so much. No, I need to eat more meat to nourish myself!</p><p>The fat man shouted and gnawed on the leg of lamb in his hand. Then, under everyone’s gaze, he stepped onto the 20th step.</p><p>The ordinary-looking young man also stepped onto the 20th step.</p><p>Shocking, shocking!</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded.</p><p>What was going on today? Usually, very few people could reach the top, but now, so many people had appeared at once. Four people, a total of four people had reached the 20th step.</p><p>Most importantly, these four people were unfamiliar faces and were not on the list of top 1000 talents.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah, I can’t take it anymore. I want to eat meat to nourish myself. It’s too painful!”</p><p>The fat man shouted as he gnawed on the Lamb leg. He was actually standing firmly on the 20th step.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>The others were also speechless.</p><p>Some people were even more indignant. Even this fatty could climb up; it was too unfair.</p><p>that young man seems to be the rising genius of the heavenly corpse sect. His name is corpse King!</p><p>At this moment, someone recognized the ordinary-looking young man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
