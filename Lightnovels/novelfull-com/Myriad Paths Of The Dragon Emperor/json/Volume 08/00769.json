Next, the judge selected two more forces to fight.</p><p>...</p><p>The difference in strength between these two forces was quite large, so it was easy to determine the winner.</p><p>Following that, the competition continued.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten matches had been fought.</p><p>“Next, the sea Cloud sect versus the iron bone sect!”</p><p>The judge’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Haha, Qiao long, I didn’t expect to fight against your Sea Cloud sect. This is what I want!”</p><p>The sect leader of the iron bone sect laughed heartily.</p><p>Qiao long was slightly taken aback, then sneered. “This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, nine people from each side jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing stood behind the formation, looking at each other.</p><p>The iron bone sect did invite a few experts. Two of them were at the late third level of the spiritual ocean tier, and one more was at the third level of the spiritual ocean tier. The rest were all at the second level of the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>In contrast, the strongest on Lu Ming’s side was only at the peak second level of the spiritual ocean realm. There were as many as five people at the first level of the spiritual ocean realm.</p><p>“Hahaha, Sea Cloud sect, I advise you to admit defeat. There’s no suspense in this battle!”</p><p>A burly man from the iron bone sect laughed.</p><p>the last part of your sentence is right. There is no suspense in this battle. However, you are the ones who have lost. You should quickly admit defeat and reduce some losses!</p><p>Fatty Kong Jin grinned as he carried his battle axe.</p><p>“Haha, fatty, what did you just say? you want us to admit defeat? Is there something wrong with your head?” The burly man from the iron bone sect laughed, his laughter filled with mockery.</p><p>Around the fighting ring, the people from the other forces also laughed.</p><p>The sea Cloud sect’s lineup was too horrible to look at. They had five people at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier. It could be said that they were one of the worst forces out of the thirty-six.</p><p>And that fatty actually shamelessly said that he wanted the iron bone sect to admit defeat? It was too funny.</p><p>“You dare to talk to me like that? hehe, I’ll remember that!”</p><p>Kong Jin looked at the burly man and smiled hideously.</p><p>don’t attack. I alone am enough to defeat them!</p><p>The burly man from the iron bone sect stepped forward with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As he stepped forward, the battle platform rumbled. The aura of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier exploded out, and a battle-axe appeared in his hand.</p><p>With his cultivation at the late third level of the spiritual ocean tier, he alone was enough to defeat the sea Cloud sect’s lineup.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you guys don’t do anything. Let me do it alone!”</p><p>Kong Jin shouted. He carried his battle axe and rushed forward.</p><p>The people watching the battle were speechless. This fatty was really boasting shamelessly. With a mere first level spiritual ocean tier cultivation, he actually declared that he would defeat the nine people from the iron bone sect by himself?</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>The people from the iron bone sect even revealed mocking smiles.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man from the iron bone sect shouted. His voice was like thunder as he swung his axe at Kong Jin.</p><p>Kong Jin laughed hideously. With a wave of his hand, the door-sized battleaxe slashed forward.</p><p>Clang! Bang!</p><p>The two battle-axes collided with a clang. Then, a shocking scene appeared. The battle-axe in the burly man’s hand directly exploded into pieces and scattered in all directions. However, the battle-axe did not stop and continued to chop down.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The burly man shouted in fear.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The next moment, he was directly cut in half by the axe.</p><p>The entire scene fell silent. Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared at the scene in shock.</p><p>Kong Jin, this first level spiritual ocean tier martial artist actually killed a late stage third level spiritual ocean tier martial artist in one move. How was this possible? It was too unbelievable.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Before anyone could react, Kong Jin had already lifted his battle axe and pounced on the iron bone sect like a berserk beast. The attack of his battle axe was as violent as a storm.</p><p>“Set up the formation, set up the formation!”</p><p>The people of the iron bone sect finally reacted and shouted in fear.</p><p>The remaining eight people hurriedly set up a battle formation to block Kong Jin.</p><p>However, they were useless in the end. Kong Jin’s attack was too violent. He had comprehended the shattering will and the earth will. The combination of these two will had an unimaginable destructive power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In just a few moves, the iron bone sect’s formation was completely destroyed by Kong Jin.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>With a wave of the battle-axe, another expert at the late stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier was killed, and another expert at the early stage of the third level of the spiritual ocean tier was also killed.</p><p>Kong Jin was like a violent beast, invincible.</p><p>“We admit defeat, we admit defeat!”</p><p>The remaining six people screamed madly. They were already scared out of their wits.</p><p>“Hmph, you really can’t take a beating.”</p><p>Kong Jin pursed his lips. He was a little unhappy. He carried his battle axe and walked back.</p><p>Everyone around them could only open their eyes wide and watch this scene in a daze. They looked at Kong Jin in a daze.</p><p>He was too strong. He had single-handedly defeated the iron bone sect.</p><p>The iron bone sect was really pitiful. The burly man had said that he would defeat the sea Cloud sect alone, but in the end, Kong Jin had defeated them all by himself.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>In the iron bone sect’s area, the sect master’s face was pale. He looked at the scene in disbelief as he muttered to himself.</p><p>“Haha, didn’t I just say it? Don’t be too full of yourself before the battle, or you won’t be able to get off the stage.”</p><p>Qiao long looked at the sect leader of the iron bone sect and laughed heartily.</p><p>“Heaven’s favorite, he’s definitely a heaven’s favorite. Qiao long, how did your Sea Cloud sect manage to invite such a person?”</p><p>The sect leader of the iron bone sect said with red eyes.</p><p>With a cultivation at the first level of the spiritual ocean tier, he was actually able to kill an expert at the late third level of the spiritual ocean tier with a single move. This kind of combat power had even reached the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. This wasn’t just a heaven’s favorite, and it wasn’t an ordinary heaven’s favorite either. It was a top-notch heaven’s favorite.</p><p>How could the sea Cloud sect invite such a powerful heaven’s favorite?</p><p>“You don’t need to worry about this!”</p><p>Qiao long sneered, feeling extremely comfortable in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, the leaders of the other forces were also discussing.</p><p>that fatty is definitely a top-notch heaven’s pride expert. It’s unbelievable that he could kill an opponent who was two levels higher than him. Ordinary heaven’s pride experts can’t do that!</p><p>his battle prowess has probably already reached the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier. The first level of the spiritual ocean tier is actually equivalent to the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier’s battle prowess. This is too terrifying, right!</p><p>not necessarily. From what I see, that battle-ax of his is very powerful, shattering the opponent’s spirit weapon in one move. The other party was stunned for a moment before being killed by him in one move. His battle prowess might not have reached the fourth level of the spiritual ocean tier, but it’s infinitely close.</p><p>“That makes sense!”</p><p>As the people in the area discussed the matter, the other Sea Cloud sect cultivators on the fighting platform were also somewhat stunned.</p><p>They had only stood on the stage for a short while, and had won without even setting up a battle formation.</p><p>He won too easily.</p><p>“Don’t waste it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he kept the storage rings of the three martial artists who were killed by Kong Jin. At the same time, he took the opportunity to devour their blood essence.</p><p>This was the blood essence of a martial artist at the third level of the spiritual sea realm. Lu Ming did not want to waste it.</p><p>“Fatty, three storage rings, one for each of us!”</p><p>With that said, Lu Ming threw one to Kong Jin and another to Xie nianqing. He kept one for himself.</p><p>Now, he was in dire need of spiritual crystals and couldn’t let it go.</p><p>The others looked at him with envy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
