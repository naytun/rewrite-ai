The valley was about a hundred miles long, and it was completely silent.</p><p>This was the 10000 snakes Valley. There were tens of thousands of poisonous snakes in the valley. Other demonic beasts did not dare to approach this place, so it was very quiet.</p><p>The wind howled as Lu Ming and Chi Yue sat on the cheetah puppet and descended from the sky, landing at the entrance of the 10000 snakes Valley.</p><p>The two of them kept the puppets and walked into the 10000 snakes Valley.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Before they could go far, a black venomous snake shot toward them like black Lightning.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Chi Yue stepped lightly on the ground and runes appeared on the ground, forming an inscription formation. From the inscription formation, dozens of arrows shot towards the black figures.</p><p>With a soft sound, the black snakes were accurately shot and flew out in all directions.</p><p>The two of them continued forward.</p><p>The valley was very wide, at least ten miles in length. It was covered with dense weeds, old vines, low ancient trees, and piles of rubble. In some places, there were even some stinky swamps. Such an environment was most suitable for poisonous snakes to breed.</p><p>As they moved forward, they encountered quite a number of snake attacks. However, these snakes were all below the fifth grade, which was equivalent to the martial arts Grandmaster level. Whether it was Lu Ming or Chi Yue, they could easily deal with them.</p><p>Moreover, the blood essence of these venomous snakes was useless. Lu Ming needed the blood essence of a venomous snake at the martial King realm.</p><p>When the two of them had walked more than twenty miles, the level of the poisonous snakes started to increase.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>A colorful venomous snake slithered toward Lu Ming. It extended and retracted its tongue, releasing a poisonous mist.</p><p>a King-level venomous snake! I’ve finally seen one!</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He took a step forward and reached out with his claw. The venomous snake could not put up any resistance and was caught in Lu Ming’s hand. With a shake of his essential core, the venomous snake turned into ashes at a speed visible to the naked eye. In Lu Ming’s palm, there were only nine drops of blood essence that were red and crystal-like, rolling around like blood-red pearls.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, Lu Ming suspended the nine drops of blood essence in the air and quickly carved runes with both hands. One after another, runes seeped into the nine drops of blood essence. After a while, the nine drops of blood essence exploded with a bang and turned into a cloud of blood mist that filled the air.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He then took out a Jade bottle and absorbed all the blood mist into it.</p><p>He wanted to use the blood essence of the venomous snake to create a blood mist and use it with the Crimson blood sand to break the last 36 formations.</p><p>This was also the reason why his level of inscription was not high enough. If he had become a level six inscriber and mastered some level six inscriptions and level six arrays, he would not need these materials to break the 36 arrays.</p><p>However, a bottle of blood mist was obviously far from enough. The two of them continued to look for King-level venomous snakes to make blood mist.</p><p>…….</p><p>60,000 to 70000 li away from the 10000 snakes Valley was another large tribe, the yin snake tribe.</p><p>The yin snake tribe was very powerful. In the past few decades, they had annexed many territories of the red leopard tribe, and their strength had expanded rapidly. The red leopard tribe could not compare to them.</p><p>In the ancient city of the yin snake tribe, on top of a Pavilion made of huge rocks, Xie nianqing looked into the distance with his brows furrowed.</p><p>She didn’t come to the yin snake tribe of her own free will. She was captured. Now, she had a ring on her wrists and ankles. The ring was like a snake wrapped around her body, and it was engraved with complicated inscriptions.</p><p>This ring had the power to seal the genuine Qi in Xie nianqing’s body and even the flame of inscription. She couldn’t use her cultivation at all. Otherwise, she would have escaped from this place long ago.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>The door of the room was opened, and a young man walked in.</p><p>This young man was tall and handsome, but his eyes were long and narrow, giving off a very gloomy feeling.</p><p>As soon as he walked in, the young man’s eyes wandered all over Xie nianqing’s body. His eyes were burning with a strong desire to possess her.</p><p>“What are you doing here again?”</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned.</p><p>“Miss Xie, what do you think? I won’t let you suffer if you marry me. ”</p><p>The young man smiled slightly, which made him look even more sinister.</p><p>“Get lost!” Xie nianqing shouted coldly, not at all polite.</p><p>The young man’s face turned cold. miss Xie, don’t forget where you are. I’m trying to persuade you nicely. Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit.</p><p>“Get lost!” Xie nianqing’s reply was still one word.</p><p>“Good, good, very good, let’s wait and see!”</p><p>The young man’s eyes were burning with anger. He scanned Xie nianqing’s body a few times before he left.</p><p>“This b * tch, I want you to kneel down and beg me this morning!”</p><p>The young man’s heart was burning with anger.</p><p>What was his identity? The son of the yin snake tribe’s chief, the future successor of the yin snake tribe, Yin que, had great talent. What couldn’t he get?</p><p>However, a few days ago, when he saw Xie nianqing, he was shocked.</p><p>Xie nianqing was too beautiful, completely different from the women in the underground world.</p><p>Most of the underground women were rough, and their skin was bronze in color.</p><p>Xie nianqing, on the other hand, had Jade-like skin and a graceful figure. He was immediately attracted to her. He caught Xie nianqing and wanted him to be his eighteenth concubine. However, with Xie nianqing’s personality, the result was obvious. How could he agree?</p><p>Yin que walked in the yard with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Young master, what’s wrong? That woman still hasn’t agreed?”</p><p>A skinny old man walked up and asked.</p><p>“That’s right. Not only did this b * tch not agree, but she also told me to get lost. Elder kui, what do you have in mind?”</p><p>Yin que asked.</p><p>young master, since the other party refused a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit, then let’s use force. Let’s just cook the rice!</p><p>The skinny old man sneered.</p><p>elder kui, I’ve thought about it as well, but even if her true Yuan and mental energy fire are sealed, her physical strength is still very strong. I’m afraid that if I were to use force, she would commit suicide. Otherwise, I would have done it long ago!</p><p>Yin que said. As soon as he thought of Xie nianqing’s graceful figure, an evil fire burned in his body.</p><p>young master, it’s easy. It’s the season for poisonous snakes to breed. The snake desire flower is in full bloom in the 10000 snakes Valley. The fragrance of the snake desire flower has no effect on people with Zhen Yuan or mental energy fire. However, without the protection of Zhen Yuan and mental energy fire, the body will go soft and lose all strength. At that time, young master Ren will be the one doing whatever you want.</p><p>The skinny old man gave a sinister smile.</p><p>Yin que’s eyes brightened, and he laughed out loud, ” “Elder kui, you’re really wise. Good, let’s do it this way. Elder kui, take a few people with you and use the excuse of going out to hunt to relax. Take that slut with you and follow me to 10000 snakes Valley. This time, I want to make that slut feel like she’s going to die in the 10000 snakes!”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll get it done!”</p><p>Elder kui bowed.</p><p>Not long after, Yin que, Xie nianqing, elder kui, and six other people rode on seven giant serpent puppets with wings and headed towards the 10000 snakes Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
