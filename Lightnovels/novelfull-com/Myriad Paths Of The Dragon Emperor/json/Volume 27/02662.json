It could be considered a type of special life form. Could he sense it?</p><p>Lu Ming immediately woke QiuQiu up!</p><p>Every time QiuQiu transformed into a bangle and wore it on Lu Ming’s hand, it was basically sleeping and digesting the divine artifact fragments and refining materials it had eaten.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu was awoken and transformed into a round metal ball. A huge mouth appeared on top of it, and it kept on biting.</p><p>“This glutton wants to eat the moment he wakes up!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled speechlessly. He took out a fragment of a level-five divine artifact and threw it to QiuQiu. QiuQiu bit it and ate it with loud crunching sounds.</p><p>Sparks shot out from between its teeth, and a fragment of a grade five divine artifact was instantly destroyed by QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu, try to sense if there are plant life forms here. Let’s see if you can sense them!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to play the ball.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>A pair of eyes appeared on QiuQiu’s mouth, and it started to look around.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, QiuQiu flew out toward a tree that was as thick as a person’s thigh and bit down.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, the tree jumped up and its branches swept around. The roots were like venomous snakes as they coiled around QiuQiu.</p><p>“There really is …”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun were overjoyed.</p><p>This tree was right beside them, but they didn’t feel it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Xie nianjun got close to the tree, he made his move. With a flash of his sword, the tree was split into hundreds of pieces. The wood chips flew all over the sky and a wood crystal appeared in Xie nianjun’s hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Following that, QiuQiu flew to the other side and bit down on a plant that looked like a weed.</p><p>Immediately, the plant also jumped up and ran wildly, but it was killed by Xie nianqing’s sword.</p><p>Rustle … Rustle …</p><p>The next moment, the plants around Lu Ming and the group seemed to have moved. At least a dozen types of plants moved. Their roots left the ground and ran wildly into the distance like feet.</p><p>There were large trees that required a few people to wrap their arms around, slender bamboos, a few large locust trees, and a few old vines …</p><p>“So many …”</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them were dumbfounded.</p><p>These plant life forms were invisible when they didn’t move. They didn’t expect that there would be so many plant life forms around them. Were they trying to ambush them?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two did not hold back and charged towards the plant life forms.</p><p>These plant life forms were not of high levels. The strongest one was only at fifth-level void G.o.d Realm. Not long after, they were all killed by Lu Ming and the others, and they obtained more than ten wood crystals.</p><p>This kind of wood crystal was very easy to refine. After the three of them divided it evenly, they swallowed it on the spot and refined it.</p><p>In less than an hour, he had refined all of them. Lu Ming felt that the divine power in his body had grown a lot. A wisp of divine fire burned in his dantian. Divine power kept flowing out and flowing in all his meridians.</p><p>As long as his meridians were filled with divine power, Lu Ming would be able to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Continue!</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and the rest led QiuQiu and started hunting the plant life forms.</p><p>This forest only opened once every three thousand years, and there were many plant life forms.</p><p>A few days later, they had hunted hundreds of them and obtained hundreds of wood crystals, all of which were refined by the three of them.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the divine energy in his body was becoming more and more abundant. He was getting closer and closer to the day he could break through.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s cultivation base was slightly higher. They had reached the third level of the void G.o.d Realm. They needed more energy to level up, but they had also made significant progress and were approaching the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm quickly.</p><p>A treasure land, this forest was really a treasure land.</p><p>No wonder the outer sect elder said that it was a benefit for them.</p><p>As long as he could kill plant life forms, his cultivation would rapidly increase. This was indeed a benefit.</p><p>This was especially so for Lu Ming and the rest. They could hunt plant life very quickly, which was a rare benefit. Their cultivation speed was completely incomparable to normal cultivation.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A fifth-level virtual G.o.d-level tree with a diameter of about ten meters was split in half by Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>When dealing with plant life forms, the combat sword was still more convenient.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was about to go over and peel the wood crystal when suddenly, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An arrow was shot from the front at an astonishing speed. It landed on the ground where he had just stepped on, blasting a huge pit in the ground.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was a little gloomy as he looked ahead.</p><p>In a flash, five young men, four men and one woman, appeared in front of him.</p><p>One of the young men held a large bow. He appeared in front of the tree that Lu Ming had split open and dug out a wood crystal.</p><p>“It’s such a waste to give these wood crystals to a few people who are about to die!”</p><p>The young man with the large bow smiled contemptuously. He looked at Lu Ming and the rest as if they were already dead.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes.</p><p>These few people were the ones who had repeatedly emitted killing intent towards him.</p><p>“Did Huang Wu send you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I can’t say that!”</p><p>The bow-wielding youth smiled and said, ” Huang Wu and his brother Huang Wen are both under the sacred son of reflection. You’ve injured the sacred son of reflection’s people. Do you still want to live? ”</p><p>“The sacred son of reflection!”</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. These people were the same as Huang Wu. They were all from the sacred son of reflection’s faction. Lu Ming had abused Huang Wu twice. These people were here to avenge him.</p><p>“These two girls are really beautiful. It’s a pity to kill them. How about this, I’ll give you a chance. You two, join us and serve us well, and we’ll spare your lives!”</p><p>The other young man had a lecherous look on his face. He looked at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun evilly.</p><p>“Do you think you’ve got us all in the bag?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. At the same time, he circulated his divine power, preparing for a big battle at any time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re pretty strong and you have a metallic lifeform. However, you’ll definitely die in front of us!”</p><p>The young man with the large bow said coldly, and a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>&Nbsp; the other four circulated their divine power, their powerful auras and cold killing intent erupting from them.</p><p>Two seventh level void G.o.d Realm martial artists!</p><p>Three sixth level void G.o.d Realm martial artists!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming could determine the other party’s strength. His heart sank slightly.</p><p>These young men had all been in the sect for a thousand years or even two thousand years. They were all very powerful. Needless to say, the divine power they controlled was King-grade divine power, which was not something ordinary people could compare to.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s combat strength was shocking, but their cultivation was limited. Even a third-level void G.o.d Realm would find it difficult to deal with a sixth-level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s abilities, he was no match for a sixth-level virtual G.o.d.</p><p>QiuQiu’s strength was slightly stronger, but a seventh-level void G.o.d-level existence was enough to stop him.</p><p>The situation was not in their favor.</p><p>At this time, a figure flashed in the sky, and an old man appeared.</p><p>This old man was one of the four outer sect deacons.</p><p>The old man saw everything that was happening below.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
