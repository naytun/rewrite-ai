Only an expert at the true G.o.d Realm could unleash the full power of a middle-grade divine weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes burned even more fervently. He kept the long staff and sped up to read it.</p><p>“Level three middle grade G.o.d equipment, level two middle grade G.o.d equipment …”</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ming put away all the weapons.</p><p>There were a total of thirty-three divine artifacts.</p><p>All of them were Level Seven low-grade G.o.d equipment and above. Any one of them was better than the meteor spear that he was using now.</p><p>&Nbsp; among them, there were twenty low-quality divine artifacts.</p><p>There were a total of thirteen middle-grade divine artifacts.</p><p>There were even two G.o.d tools in there. The highest level was a level Seven middle grade G.o.d tool. One was a battle sword, and the other was a battle saber.</p><p>How many G.o.d crystals could a middle grade level Seven G.o.d equipment be sold for?</p><p>Lu Ming could not estimate the value of a divine weapon of this level. Even forces like the righteous Army, the origin Hall, and the Walkabout sect could not produce one.</p><p>It was too precious!</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea how many divine crystals the thirty-three divine artifacts were worth. In short, he knew that he had struck it rich.</p><p>From now on, he wouldn’t have to worry about resources. His disciples, family, friends, and the people of the Dragon Alliance wouldn’t have to worry about resources either.</p><p>“Meteor spear, you can change it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was all smiles.</p><p>Among the 33 divine artifacts, there were a few Spears.</p><p>The highest grade one was a middle grade rank four G.o.d artifact.</p><p>&Nbsp; in addition, he had a level eight low quality G.o.d artifact and a level nine low quality G.o.d artifact.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a level nine low-grade divine artifact and waved it a few times. It felt pretty good.</p><p>After looting all the divine artifacts, Lu Ming wandered around for a while. He left only after he was sure that there were no more treasures.</p><p>I can’t go in with my cultivation. I can go back!</p><p>Lu Ming was satisfied.</p><p>After that, he would go through the cave and return to the hurricane tunnel.</p><p>Then, he followed the original path and climbed the rock back.</p><p>Going back was going against the wind, and it was very difficult.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had already killed all the lion-headed Eagle beasts in the hurricane pa.s.sage. There were no Lion-headed Eagle beasts to stop him on his way back. Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had increased by a notch, so he was still very fast.</p><p>Even if it was against the wind, it was still many times faster than when they came.</p><p>After Lu Ming had crawled back for a while, the people from the free and unfettered sect of the yuanluo Palace finally opened the formation of the pa.s.sage. They rushed through the pa.s.sage.</p><p>At the end of the pa.s.sage was the place where Lu Ming had obtained a large number of divine artifacts.</p><p>Then, the palace Master, situ haonan, and the others realized that the place was still empty.</p><p>Other than some stone chairs and tables, there was nothing else.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The yuanluo Palace Master bellowed. He could no longer control his temper.</p><p>After all his hard work, he found that there was nothing here.</p><p>If he knew that Lu Ming had already arrived here, he would probably vomit blood in anger.</p><p>Everyone’s face was extremely unsightly. Then, when they found the hurricane tunnel, their faces became even more unsightly.</p><p>The hurricane pa.s.sage here was a combination of several pa.s.sages, and its power was astonishing. Even the yuanluo Palace Master was a little afraid of it.</p><p>“This should be a barrier set up by the master of the cave. Could it be that the real inner cave is in the depths of these Hurricane pa.s.sages?”</p><p>They guessed.</p><p>However, they were hesitant.</p><p>Usually, such a place would definitely be accompanied by danger.</p><p>“Let’s observe for a few days before making a decision!”</p><p>The yuan Luo Palace Master said.</p><p>……</p><p>In the sky above the zhengtian Army Headquarters on zhengtian planet, the ancestor of technique and Fu Heng had been playing this game of chess for more than two years.</p><p>And now, it was already the final moment.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique waved his hand and a huge chess piece was formed. He then placed it on the chessboard.</p><p>Fu Heng’s expression changed. He waved his hand, and a powerful force rushed toward the ancestor of technique, preventing him from placing the chess piece.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them continued to attack each other.</p><p>In the past two years, the two of them had already gone through this kind of confrontation countless times.</p><p>After a dozen moves!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, the ancestor of technique’s chess piece still landed on the chessboard.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique looked at Fu Heng.</p><p>brother fa is indeed talented. I am impressed. The game is over, and I have fulfilled my promise. Brother fa, please don’t blame me. I’m leaving!</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, Fu Heng soared into the sky. Then, an interplanetary warship appeared. He boarded the warship and left the true sky Star.</p><p>Northern Shang planet …</p><p>The moment Fu Heng left, the ancestor of technique immediately went to the teleportation formation and headed to the northern Shang planet.</p><p>After arriving at Seven Star Island, he immediately rushed to the ancient gold mine and met up with the righteous Army 100000 miles away from the ancient gold Island.</p><p>“The general is here!”</p><p>“General!”</p><p>The people of the righteous Army immediately saluted the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“What’s the situation at the yuan Luo Palace in the past two years?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique asked.</p><p>“General, for the past two years, the palace Master of the yuanluo Palace, the sect master of the Xiaoyao sect, and the others have all been in the cave abodes of the experts. They have never come out!”</p><p>Someone reported.</p><p>“That old fox situ haonan is here too!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint as he ordered, ” “You guys wait for me here, I’ll go check it out myself!”</p><p>With that, the ancestor of technique turned into a beam of light and rushed toward the old gold mine.</p><p>“It’s the righteous heaven Army’s general fa Ming!”</p><p>“Quickly inform the hall Master and the others!”</p><p>The moment the ancestor of technique arrived, the people from the yuanluo Palace and the carefree sect immediately noticed him. Under the leadership of a few true G.o.d stage experts, they were on high alert and sent the news to the yuanluo Palace Master and the others.</p><p>Both Yuan Luo Palace Master and situ haonan received the news at the same time.</p><p>“Fa Ming actually dared to come alone. Fine, I’ll make him stay today!”</p><p>Yuan Luo Palace master’s eyes glinted with a cold light.</p><p>After spending a few years without getting anything in return, he was filled with anger.</p><p>that’s good. We’ll get rid of fa Ming and split the righteous Army’s territory equally!</p><p>Situ haonan also said coldly.</p><p>elder mo, you should hide in the dark first. Fa Ming might think that you’re still guarding the headquarters. Later on, when brother situ and I fight with fa Ming, you’ll secretly attack and ambush him!</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall ordered.</p><p>The yuanluo Palace Master was rather wary of the ancestor of technique.</p><p>He and Mo kan were both at the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm, while the ancestor of technique was only at the third stage of true G.o.d Realm. However, the ancestor of technique’s combat power was extremely strong. With his power alone, he could fight with the two of them.</p><p>Even with the help of situ haonan, they were not confident that they could stop the ancestor of technique if they were to fight him head on. They could not stop him if he wanted to leave.</p><p>Only a sneak attack could possibly stop the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Don’t worry. The Grand Elder of the Walkabout sect is also hiding near the chenjin mine. He can also launch a sneak attack when the time comes. We’ll definitely make fa Ming stay here today!”</p><p>Situ haonan said coldly.</p><p>The yuan Luo Palace master’s heart trembled as he thought,”old fox,” this situ haonan must have asked a Grand Elder of the Walkabout sect to hide in the dark to guard against the yuan Luo Palace.</p><p>“Alright, then today, I’ll make sure that fa Ming won’t be able to return!”</p><p>The yuan Luo Palace Master said coldly as they headed out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
