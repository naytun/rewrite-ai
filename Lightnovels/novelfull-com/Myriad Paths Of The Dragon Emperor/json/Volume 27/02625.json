The elimination rate was shockingly high.</p><p>Out of ten people, only one person could pa.s.s.</p><p>At this moment, everyone understood that they had completely underestimated Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could pa.s.s through easily not because the difficulty of the stone door was low, but because he was talented and powerful.</p><p>“Situ Feng has made his move!”</p><p>Someone suddenly spoke.</p><p>Situ Feng walked toward the stone door calmly. A combat sword appeared in his hand, and sword light burst forth. Every time he stabbed, it would hit nothing. It didn’t collide with the divine light from the stone door, but the divine light would dissipate one by one.</p><p>Situ Feng also pa.s.sed the test easily.</p><p>“Good comprehension!”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe nodded slightly.</p><p>After situ Feng, it was Kang long, situ Xiao, and the others.</p><p>Kang long and situ Xiao both controlled King grade divine power. Although it was not easy, they still pa.s.sed.</p><p>However, the other two from the yuanluo Palace and the Walkabout sect had failed.</p><p>This way, only three people from the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect pa.s.sed the test.</p><p>Soon, dandan, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, Tong Xi ‘er, and the others also stepped forward.</p><p>As the divine turtle of the world, dandan also had amazing potential after becoming a G.o.d. She had also mastered King-grade divine power and pa.s.sed the a.s.sessment.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun loosened their grip, which made the old man’s eyes light up again.</p><p>Following that, Tong Xi ‘er also pa.s.sed the test, but the rest of the righteous Army had all failed.</p><p>In this way, the righteous Army, Lu Ming and the rest, a total of five people pa.s.sed. This made Kang Ji, situ haonan and the rest’s expressions turn ugly.</p><p>The stone gate a.s.sessment continued for a few days. Finally, all 5060 people had been tested.</p><p>Five hundred people!</p><p>In the end, only 500 people pa.s.sed the test of the stone door. The others all failed.</p><p>The success rate was shockingly low.</p><p>In the entire chaotic astral River, there were close to 1000 powers and 50000 to 60000 Young heaven’s pride experts. In the end, only 500 people pa.s.sed the test.</p><p>A one in a hundred chance.</p><p>alright, my test is over. The 500 of you can head to the Qin heaven star system’s myriad spirit planet to take part in the Qin heaven thirteen clans ‘test. Take this Jade token!</p><p>With that, the elder in the brocade robe waved his hand and five hundred Jade tokens flew out, flying toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>They stretched out their hands and with the help of the Jade token, each of them got one.</p><p>The Jade token felt warm and heavy in his hand. There were lines of tiny runes on it, and it looked very beautiful.</p><p>On one side of the Jade token, there was a picture of ruins.</p><p>“The picture of the ruins on this Jade plate is the symbol of the chaotic astral River. Different galaxies have different pictures and symbols!”</p><p>The brocade-robed elder said.</p><p>Many people smile bitterly. Indeed, in the eyes of many powerful and wealthy galaxies, the chaotic astral River is nothing but a wasteland.</p><p>now, use your own blood to engrave your names on the Jade tokens. This Jade token will then be bound to you. Only you can use it. Even if others take it, they won’t be able to use it. This is the proof that you will be able to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment!</p><p>The brocade-robed elder said.</p><p>Lu Ming forced out a drop of blood and wrote the two words ‘Lu Ming’ on the Jade tablet.</p><p>After he was done, the blood seeped into the Jade token and disappeared. The Jade token was completely bound to Lu Ming’s aura. Other than Lu Ming, no one else could use it.</p><p>This was to prevent anyone from taking action against the partic.i.p.ants, s.n.a.t.c.hing their Jade tokens and impersonating them.</p><p>In this way, even if he s.n.a.t.c.hed the Jade token, it would be of no use.</p><p>alright, the Qin heaven thirteen clans ‘test will be held on planet myriad spirit in three months. You can make your way there in three months!</p><p>however, I can tell you in advance that don’t think that you can join the Qin Tian thirteen high school just because you pa.s.sed my test. It’s extremely difficult to join the Qin Tian thirteen clans. It’s already not bad if 20 of you can join the Qin Tian thirteen clans!</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe turned around and left with the pavilion master and the others.</p><p>“It’s already not bad to have twenty people join?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled, and their expressions turned grave.</p><p>Everyone had their own thoughts as they left the place.</p><p>let’s go back to the zhengtian Army. I’ll make some arrangements and take you to planet thousand spirits!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>After that, everyone returned to true heavenstar through the teleportation formation.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his residence and explained the matter to his parents. He also bade his parents farewell.</p><p>If he were to join a sect on planet myriad spirit, he probably wouldn’t be back for a while.</p><p>The ancestor of technique had also settled the matters of the righteous Army. Then, he set off with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Xiangxiang and Ouyang Moli remained on true sky Star.</p><p>However, bubbles kept pestering Lu Ming and wanted to follow him. Lu Ming brought bubbles along.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, dandan, bubbles, Tong Xi ‘er, and the ancestor of technique-a total of seven people-headed towards planet thousand spirits.</p><p>Myriad spirit star was located at the center of Qin heaven’s Galaxy. It was at least a few dozen galaxies away from the chaotic astral River. It was simply too far away.</p><p>Even if they took the teleportation formation, it would take a long time.</p><p>They first arrived at Cloud Peak City and took the super-long distance teleportation array in Cloud Peak City to be teleported to the next Galaxy.</p><p>&Nbsp; afterward, they used super-long-distance teleportation arrays to travel at a faster speed, but the divine crystals they used up were also astonishing.</p><p>He couldn’t just build a teleportation formation for nothing. Every time he built a teleportation formation, he would have to use up divine crystals.</p><p>Even so, it still took them nearly two months to get to planet thousand spirits. There was less than a month left before the three-month deadline.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>Standing on planet thousand spirits, he took a deep breath and felt the divine Qi rush into his body. He felt very comfortable.</p><p>The training environment here is much better than the chaotic astral River. The difference is huge.</p><p>Myriad spirit star was located in the center of the Qin heaven Star Zone. It was the biggest trading planet in the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>This planet didn’t belong to any single power. Countless powers, big and small, were doing business here, and it was extremely prosperous.</p><p>The Qin heavenly thirteen clans ‘recruitment test had always been held on myriad spirit planet.</p><p>The location was the largest city on planet thousand spirits, thousand spirits city.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the group arrived at Wanling city, they found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more people arrived in Wanling city. On the streets, one could easily see groups of young sovereigns.</p><p>Some of them had extremely terrifying auras. At a glance, they seemed to be extremely powerful monsters.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region had a total of several hundred galaxies. The chaotic astral River was the worst and the one that no one paid attention to.</p><p>Any of the other galaxies are more prosperous and powerful than the chaotic astral River. The number of heaven’s pride experts in the other galaxies is also far beyond the chaotic astral River.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, only 500 people have pa.s.sed the test and can take part in the exam.</p><p>However, in the other galaxies, even the worst would still have thousands of people who could take the a.s.sessment. The higher ones had thousands or even tens of thousands of people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
