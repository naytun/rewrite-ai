He was the yuanluo Palace Master, Kang Ji.</p><p>The other person was an old man with three eyes on his forehead and long golden hair. He was also a member of the three-eyed race, the same race as the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>This elder’s status in the yuanluo Palace was extraordinary. He was the Supreme elder and was extremely powerful. He was on the same level as the yuanluo Palace Master. His name was mo kan.</p><p>The two of them were the strongest in the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>the deity’s abode. I didn’t think that there would really be a deity’s abode on the northern Shang planet!</p><p>The three eyed race’s elder mo kan’s eyes were burning with pa.s.sion.</p><p>I originally thought that it would at most be a real G.o.d’s cave dwelling. I didn’t expect that it would be a heavenly G.o.d’s cave dwelling. This is a huge opportunity!</p><p>The eyes of the palace Master of the yuanluo Palace were burning with desire.</p><p>“Hallmaster, the righteous Army’s fa Ming has probably received the news as well. He’s probably rushing to Northern Shang as well. He’ll be a problem!”</p><p>Mo kan frowned and said.</p><p>Fa Ming was the ancestor of technique’s name.</p><p>“That ant from a small chiliocosm. If I had known this would happen, I would have killed him back then and we wouldn’t have had to face this trouble now!”</p><p>At the mention of the ancestor of technique, the eyes of the yuanluo Palace Master were filled with killing intent.</p><p>unfortunately, he’s already grown up. Even if the two of us join forces, we might not be able to kill him!</p><p>Mo kan said helplessly.</p><p>once we obtain the treasures in the deity’s cave abode and increase our strength greatly, we’ll definitely kill him. Moreover, I already have a plan this time. That old man Fu Heng still owes me a favor. I’ve already sent him a voice transmission. He’ll go and delay fa Ming for a while!</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall said.</p><p>“Hall Master is wise. With Fu Heng helping, I can rest a.s.sured. Hall Master, let’s go!”</p><p>Mo kan was overjoyed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Together with mo kan, the yuanluo Hall Master led a group of experts toward the North Shang planet.</p><p>……</p><p>Zhengtian Army, zhengtian star.</p><p>“An expert’s cave? It’s worth the attention of the yuanluo Palace. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>In a Hall, the ancestor of technique also received the news. He stepped out and was about to head to the teleportation array to the northern Shang planet.</p><p>“Brother fa Ming, where are you going in such a hurry?”</p><p>At this moment, an old voice was heard. A figure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>This figure was an old man with silver skin. He was obviously not human.</p><p>The old man was wearing a long white robe. He stood on the clouds and smiled at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Fu Heng!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique frowned. Fu Heng, ” he said. what brings you here to the righteous Army? ”</p><p>“Brother fa Ming, it’s been tens of thousands of years since we last met. I’ve come today to play a game of chess with you!”</p><p>Fu Heng smiled.</p><p>“Playing chess with me? I’m not free today!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“I can only play this game today. If it were another day, I won’t be able to play this game anymore!”</p><p>Fu Heng smiled and took a step forward. He came in front of the ancestor of technique and blocked his way.</p><p>“Did Kang Ji ask you to come?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s face darkened.</p><p>“Back then, I received a great favor from him. I have no choice but to return this favor!”</p><p>Fu Heng sighed.</p><p>“It seems that the cave abode on planet Northern Shang is no small matter. Kang Ji actually found you to delay me so that I can’t rush to planet Northern Shang!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was very smart. He thought about it and figured out everything.</p><p>“Brother fa Ming, let’s play the next round. I’ll leave once this round is over!”</p><p>Fu Heng smiled and waved his hand. A huge flag appeared in the air.</p><p>The ancestor of technique frowned. Fu Heng was very powerful. If he really wanted to fight him, he had no confidence at all. There was even a high possibility that he would not be able to defeat him.</p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through the ancestor of technique’s mind.</p><p>“Alright, since you’re in such a good mood, let’s play a round!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was also helpless. He then sat cross-legged in the air, facing Fu Heng with the chess game between them.</p><p>At the same time, he sent out a message to inform the righteous sky Army that they were not to make a move no matter what they encountered before he arrived on the planet.</p><p>Then, he started playing chess with Fu Heng.</p><p>On planet Northern Shang, in the Chen gold mine, the yuanluo Hall Master Kang Ji and the others had arrived.</p><p>“Greetings, Hall Master!”</p><p>The true G.o.d Realm old man and the other people from the yuanluo Palace bowed.</p><p>“How is it? Did you guys check this cave abode first?”</p><p>The hall Master of the yuan Luo Hall asked.</p><p>Palace Master, we’ve already gone to investigate, but there’s a powerful defensive formation outside the cave abode. I can’t break it with my cultivation. I’m afraid we’ll need Palace Master and Grand Elder to work together to break it!</p><p>The true G.o.d Realm old man reported.</p><p>there’s a great formation. It’s within my expectations. Let’s go!</p><p>The palace Master of the yuanluo Palace led a group of experts into the cave abode and arrived at the gate of the building.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palace Master of the yuanluo Palace made his move. A terrifying attack was launched at the door.</p><p>Rays of light shone on the door, blocking the attack from the palace Master.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a loud boom, the array at the gate started to shake.</p><p>The strength of the yuanluo Palace Master was much stronger than the true G.o.d Realm elder.</p><p>The true G.o.d Realm elder was only at the first stage of the true G.o.d Realm, while the hall Master of the yuan Luo Hall had already reached the fourth stage of the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“It’s effective!”</p><p>“The hall Master is truly amazing!”</p><p>The eyes of the other people from the yuanluo Palace lit up as they began to flatter him.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and break the formation as quickly as possible!”</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall ordered.</p><p>Then, the experts of the yuanluo Palace attacked together.</p><p>However, this array was indeed very strong. Even if their attacks were effective, it would not be broken in a short time. It would take a long time to slowly wear out the energy of the array.</p><p>On the other side, QiuQiu was still biting the wall.</p><p>At this moment, there was already a large hole on the wall that was a meter deep.</p><p>“This wall is really hard!”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Now, he could only wait patiently. With his cultivation, he couldn’t help much.</p><p>A day pa.s.sed just like that.</p><p>The wall had already been bitten three meters deep by QiuQiu.</p><p>Ka-bang!</p><p>With QiuQiu’s bite, the wall was finally bitten through.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu also became spirited. It bit harder. Soon, a hole appeared. The wall had been completely opened up, and dim light came from the other side.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shrunk and he rushed into the cave in the wall. The next moment, he appeared in a pa.s.sage.</p><p>The tunnel was surrounded by pitch-black walls. They had dug through the walls in the middle of the tunnel.</p><p>Lu Ming identified the direction and then strode toward the depths of the pa.s.sage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
