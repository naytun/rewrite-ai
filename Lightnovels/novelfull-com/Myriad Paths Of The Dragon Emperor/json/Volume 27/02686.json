If you can defeat me, I’ll give you back the ten million. Now, let s give the divine crystals to patriarch of law enforcement!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a storage ring and stored ten million divine crystals in it. He then handed the storage ring to a law enforcement patriarch.</p><p>Huang Chengan also handed the king-grade divine skill to the law enforcement elder. Then, the two of them returned to the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Huang Chengan’s body. His divine power surged and was instantly activated to the extreme.</p><p>you may have defeated Dongfang Hao, but you’re still not strong enough to defeat me!</p><p>Huang Chengan said indifferently, full of confidence.</p><p>Earlier, he had seen the fight between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao. Lu Ming was only slightly stronger than Dongfang Hao. In fact, he might not even be stronger than Dongfang Hao. The reason Dongfang Hao was killed by Lu Ming was that he had overexerted his divine power.</p><p>His combat strength was much stronger than Dongfang Hao’S. He was confident that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are very confident. I hope you have the corresponding strength!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You’ll see it soon!”</p><p>Huang Chengan said coldly. A long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Huang Chengan was also good at using a long spear.</p><p>“Moon reading ghost spear!”</p><p>With a long howl, Huang Chengan made his move. With a thrust of his spear, ghostly shadows filled the fighting ring. Countless roars rang out, shocking everyone.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a black spear shadow stabbed toward Lu Ming as fast as lightning.</p><p>Huang Chengan used his most powerful divine skill.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and divine power circulated. He also stabbed out with his spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a sharp sound of collision. Lu Ming had defeated Huang Chengan s spear shadow. However, at this moment, a strange energy invaded Lu Ming’s body. In an instant, it appeared in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and turned into a few ghostly shadows, trying to tear Lu Ming’s soul apart.</p><p>Huang Chengan’s attack could actually directly attack the soul. It was very strange.</p><p>However, Lu Ming circulated his ruler’s divine power in his sea of consciousness. The ghostly figures dissipated, but Lu Ming also took a few steps back. On the surface, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Lu Ming is no match for them. He’s been forced to retreat!</p><p>he is indeed not Huang Chengan’s match!</p><p>it’s already a miracle that he could defeat Dongfang Hao. After all, Dongfang Hao is only at the bottom of the virtual God ranking list. His ranking is still unstable, so he can’t be compared to Huang Chengan!</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is going to be defeated. It’s a pity that it’s not a</p><p>Deathmatch this time. Huang Chengan can’t kill Lu Ming without signing the Deathmatch agreement!</p><p>Some people immediately started discussing. Those who had lost the divine crystals could not wait for Lu Ming to be defeated. Although they would not be able to get back the divine crystals, they would feel more comfortable.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>After forcing Lu Ming back with one move, Huang Chengan’s follow-up attacks were endless as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. This time, he used his ruler’s divine power to guard his sea of consciousness. The other party’s attack could not break in at all.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously struck out with his spear and collided with his opponent.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Huang Chengan became more and more shocked as he fought.</p><p>Huang Chengan, this is all you’ve got. It seems like you won’t be able to get your divine crystals back!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t be too smug. Watch my strongest move, moon reading ghost spear, shocking explosion divine ring!</p><p>Huang Chengan bellowed. Suddenly, his strength increased by another level.</p><p>“That’s the second level of the divine skill!”</p><p>that’s terrifying. As expected of someone ranked 98th on the virtual God ranking. He’s only at level nine of the virtual God Realm, but he’s already cultivated the moon-reading ghost spear to level two!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>Generally speaking, those at the ninth tier of the void God Realm could comprehend and cultivate divine skills. However, it was difficult for those who were not talented enough to successfully cultivate them.</p><p>Only people with high talent could successfully cultivate it, but they were usually at the first stage. Only after breaking through to the true God Realm could they cultivate to the second stage.</p><p>For example, chaotic astral river’s yuan Luo Hall Master Kang Ji and unfettered sect’s sect master situ haonan were both at the fourth level of the true God stage. Moreover, they had only managed to cultivate their divine skills to the second level after countless years of cultivation.</p><p>Huang Chengan, on the other hand, was only at the ninth level of the void God Realm, but he had already cultivated the divine skill to the second level, which showed his talent.</p><p>The long spear in Huang Chengan’s hand trembled and then spun continuously. A Black Vortex appeared at the tip of the spear, emitting a terrifying tearing force.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Huang Chengan roared and charged towards Lu Ming. The Black Vortex also charged towards Lu Ming, wanting to crush him into pieces.</p><p>“The power of the second stage of the divine skill is indeed amazing!” Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly. He knew that he could not block the other party’s move by relying on the incomplete divine skill alone.</p><p>“In that case, let’s see the power of the ((three apocalyptic strikes)) !</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and the momentum of the spear suddenly changed.</p><p>the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-breaking!</p><p>A deep voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Lu Ming’s entire body merged with the spear, and a Spear’s gleam shot up. It was so stunning that it seemed to shatter the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear gleam charged into the pitch-black Vortex that Huang Chengan had created.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>Huang Chengan shouted. However, the next moment, his expression changed drastically. His eyes popped out and he looked extremely frightened.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the pitch-black Vortex he had created rumbled continuously. In the end, it was pierced through by a terrifying spear radiance and exploded.</p><p>ah! Huang Chengan screamed. His body was thrown backward like a kite with a broken string. He fell heavily on the ground and slid all the way to the edge of the fighting ring before stopping.</p><p>The scene was dead silent.</p><p>Everyone looked at the scene in disbelief.</p><p>Everyone saw Huang Chengan spit out a large mouthful of blood. His breath was extremely weak, and a hole had appeared in his chest, from the front to the back, with blood flowing out.</p><p>He was defeated. Huang Chengan was defeated!</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Huang Chengan. This level of combat strength was too terrifying, right?</p><p>In the midst of their joy, Huang Wen and the others revealed expressions of shock.</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the fighting ring and strode toward Huang Chengan. “I’m not fighting anymore, I’m not fighting anymore, 1 admit defeat!” Huang Chengan shouted and rushed down the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming is the winner of this battle. This is your trophy!”</p><p>The elders of the Tribunal Council were shocked as well. They handed over the ten million divine crystals and the Royal-grade technique to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Did Lu Ming just use a godly skill?”</p><p>it’s definitely a divine skill, and its power is extremely shocking!</p><p>“He’s only at the 4th level of the void God Realm. How did he manage to successfully cultivate the divine skill? This is too abnormal!”</p><p>he’s abnormal. If he grows up, the Kong Xuan sect will probably have another Saint!</p><p>Even now, many people were still unable to calm down and were immersed in shock.</p><p>“The power of the three apocalyptic strikes is indeed amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He realized that the power of the three apocalyptic strikes was much stronger than the moon reading ghost spear’ that Huang Chengan cultivated. Just now, Lu Ming had only used the power of the first stage and he had already broken through the second stage..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
