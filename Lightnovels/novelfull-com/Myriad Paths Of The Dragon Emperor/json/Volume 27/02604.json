All my people in that small chiliocosm died in your hands. Today, I will burn your bones and scatter your ashes!”</p><p>The three-eyed elder’s eyes were cold as he stepped forward. Divine power surged and the saber in his hand trembled, forming a terrifying saber Qi that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>Only an expert at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm could give him such great pressure.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s body, the power of domination and the power of the world circulated crazily. The meteor spear glowed and raised his combat strength to the extreme.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three eyed race’s old man roared. His battle blade was deathly white as it cut through the void. It was extremely fast as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and welcomed the attack.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged more than ten moves. Lu Ming could feel that the other party’s Saber Force was like an avalanche, surging towards him in waves. It was shockingly powerful.</p><p>The long spear trembled and Lu Ming’s arm went numb. He was forced to retreat by this force.</p><p>impressive. 5th tier void G.o.d Realm. Impressive indeed. I’m not his match!</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Previously, he had estimated that he would not be a match for a fifth-level void G.o.d. Now that they had exchanged blows, he realized that the combat strength of a fifth-level void G.o.d was beyond his expectations.</p><p>In the void G.o.d Realm, the span of each level was very large. The higher the level, the greater the span.</p><p>However, this further ignited his battle intent.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in the air and his body became one with the spear. He turned into a spear ray and charged towards the three-eyed elder.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>The three eyed race’s old man’s eyes flashed with a trace of shock. The killing intent in his heart became even more intense as he slashed out his saber towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight. However, Lu Ming was no match for the three-eyed race’s elder. He was being suppressed by the three-eyed race’s elder and was forced to retreat continuously. However, Lu Ming’s tenacity was shocking. He blocked the three-eyed race’s elder with all his might. It was not easy for the other party to kill him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Satisfying, satisfying …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Deep down, he was still a warmonger and desired to take risks and kill. At this moment, his blood was boiling once again.</p><p>this kid is too terrifying. I must get rid of him. I must get rid of him!</p><p>The more they fought, the more terrified the three eyed race old man became.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful. He was only at the transformation void martial stage but he had such powerful combat strength. He had never even heard of him, let alone seen him.</p><p>With such battle prowess, how terrifying would it be if he became a G.o.d?</p><p>“Quick, all of you attack together with me and kill this brat!”</p><p>The three-eyed G.o.d race messaged the surrounding experts of the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Chen gold mine was in an intense battle.</p><p>There were six to seven hundred people from the yuanluo Palace who had come to ambush them. They were all void G.o.d Realm experts, and they were locked in a fierce battle with the true sky Army experts.</p><p>There were many people fighting around Lu Ming and the three-eyed divine race elder. Naturally, some experts had noticed Lu Ming.</p><p>Instantly, some of the yuanluo Palace’s experts shook off their opponents and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The experts of the righteous Army wanted to stop him, but they couldn’t catch up.</p><p>At that moment, at least three experts rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>All three of them were at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three fifth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouses attacked at the same time, including the purple-skinned burly man who was suppressed by Lu Ming earlier.</p><p>With so many experts attacking at the same time, Lu Ming would definitely not be able to stop them. He would be killed instantly.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the bracelet that he had been wearing on his wrist flew out.</p><p>This bangle was naturally QiuQiu’s transformation.</p><p>QiuQiu flew out and expanded rapidly. Its body, which was like liquid metal, wriggled and turned into a huge shield, blocking in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>A series of explosions rang out. All the attacks were blocked, but Lu Ming was completely fine.</p><p>Then, QiuQiu’s body moved and turned into a metal ball with a diameter of ten meters. It smashed toward the purple-skinned man.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The purple-skinned burly man’s body was like a huge watermelon. QiuQiu smashed it into pieces and he died on the spot.</p><p>Now that QiuQiu had advanced to the third level of the void G.o.d Realm, its combat strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>When QiuQiu was at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, it could already fight against a fourth level void G.o.d Realm existence. Now, it wouldn’t be afraid even if it faced a sixth level void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>The purple-skinned burly man was only at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm, so he naturally couldn’t block QiuQiu’s attack.</p><p>After killing the purple-skinned burly man, QiuQiu’s body bounced and smashed towards a fifth-level void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>That expert was directly sent flying, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What kind of monster is this …”</p><p>The others felt their blood run cold. This metal-like ball didn’t look like a divine weapon, but it was shockingly powerful. A fifth level void G.o.d Realm existence was forced to spit out blood and retreat after being seriously injured by a single strike. Its power was too terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The metal ball then flew toward the three-eyed G.o.d race elder.</p><p>“Let’s join hands, let’s join hands!”</p><p>The old man from the three-eyed G.o.d race roared.</p><p>He joined forces with the other three fifth-level void G.o.d Realm experts and launched his strongest attack, which collided with QiuQiu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After a violent explosion, the three-eyed G.o.d race elder and the three fifth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm cultivators trembled violently. They were forced back and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>QiuQiu’s current strength was comparable to a sixth-level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>A sixth-level void G.o.d Realm was much stronger than a fifth-level void G.o.d Realm. Even if the three-eyed G.o.d race elder and the other three joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to withstand QiuQiu’s attack.</p><p>“QiuQiu, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out to QiuQiu. At the same time, he rushed over and attacked with all his might. He kept blasting out attacks, specifically targeting the injured fifth-level nihility G.o.d stage expert.</p><p>QiuQiu also rushed out and swelled into a metal ball with a diameter of ten meters, constantly bombarding the other party.</p><p>And at this moment, the experts of the righteous heaven Army had also arrived and were charging towards the three-eyed celestial race elder and the others.</p><p>&Nbsp; this way, there was no way they could block it. In an instant, the three-eyed G.o.d race elder and the other three were all injured, especially the one who had been struck by QiuQiu. His injuries were even more severe.</p><p>“QiuQiu, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>QiuQiu stared at the injured existence and smashed it with all its might.</p><p>The other party was already injured, so how could he block it? half of his body exploded from the blow, and he almost died.</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such an opportunity? the meteor spear pierced out and killed the person completely. With a sweep of the power of domination, he put away the person’s storage ring. Of course, Lu Ming also put away the divine weapon that the other party used.</p><p>The other party was a 5th level void G.o.d Realm expert, so he must be rich. How could he miss this opportunity?</p><p>“Retreat, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The three from the three eye race saw that one of them had been killed and were so scared that they didn’t dare to fight anymore. They quickly retreated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
