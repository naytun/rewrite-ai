They couldn’t fly up directly, so they could only climb up along the wall.</p><p>Above the abyss, the young man in luxurious clothes, the young man with the big bow, and the others were still waiting.</p><p>Hmph, it’s been so many days, but I haven’t seen them come up. I guess they’re dead down there!</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>this abyss feels extremely evil and dangerous. I think they’ve all died down there. Let’s go!</p><p>Another person said.</p><p>Time was precious!</p><p>They could only stay in the forest for three months. Now, they had been waiting here for more than 20 days, and their hearts were bleeding.</p><p>I can’t afford to waste it!</p><p>wait for three more days. If they still haven’t come out after three days, we’ll leave!</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes said.</p><p>“Guys, look! There’s someone there!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted and pointed to the edge of the abyss.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a few people climbing up from the edge of the abyss. They were Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun.</p><p>“It’s that brat! They’re still alive!”</p><p>The eyes of the young man with the bow turned cold.</p><p>“I didn’t die, but I’m dead now!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes said coldly. His powerful and cold aura locked onto Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>“They’re still here, and the number of people has increased by quite a bit!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area, cold killing intent flickering in them. He pressed his arm down and jumped into the abyss.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun emerged from the abyss and stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Finally, you can’t hold it in anymore. It’s good that we didn’t leave. Hehe, kid, this is fate. You’re destined to die!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes said ferociously.</p><p>A long sword appeared in his hand. It was extremely sharp. Divine power surged as he stepped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re right. Fortunately, you didn’t leave. Otherwise, I would have gone to find you!</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. A long spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>“If you still want to resist, I’ll kill you in three moves!”</p><p>die! the young man in luxurious clothes shouted coldly. His figure burst out, and the terrifying sword light was like a bolt of lightning, heading towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming fired a shot.</p><p>The moment he attacked, Lu Ming activated the double combat power of the ‘battle formula’.</p><p>The long spear was like a furious Dragon, bringing with it an endless Gale that swept towards the young man in luxurious clothes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a terrifying explosion and the young man’s sword radiance collapsed. Lu Ming’s long spear struck the young man’s long sword. The terrifying force bent his long sword and the violent force bombarded the young man’s body.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The sound of bones breaking came from the young man’s body. Half of his body exploded, and he was sent flying like a cannonball. He crashed into a sixth level void G.o.d Realm young man, who vomited blood and was sent flying with him.</p><p>“What …”</p><p>Everyone on the other side was dumbfounded.</p><p>One move!</p><p>In just one move, the young man in luxurious clothes was defeated and seriously injured.</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>More than twenty days ago, many people had fought with Lu Ming. Lu Ming was not that powerful?</p><p>Especially the young man with the big bow, he was so scared that he almost died.</p><p>He felt it the most. When he first came to the forest and attacked Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s ability was far from being that strong. He was not his match at all.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming managed to escape the first time. The second time they met, Lu Ming’s abilities had increased by a huge margin.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s abilities had increased by a huge margin. Such an improvement speed was too shocking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After severely injuring the young man in luxurious clothes with one move, Lu Ming let out a long howl. He became one with the spear and charged at his opponent like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun also attacked each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his spear. The terrifying spear ray was like a mountain range, pressing down on the few young men.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Some of the young men were at fifth-level and sixth-level void G.o.d Realm. They were whipped by Lu Ming and exploded in the air. Their flesh, blood, and bones flew everywhere. The scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Join hands, join hands and kill him!”</p><p>The young man with the bow shouted.</p><p>There were around thirty of them, and more than ten of them were at the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>At this moment, a few nihility G.o.d stage seven cultivators charged towards Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xie nianjun shouted coldly. His body was filled with holy light as he slashed out a sword of holy light with a mysterious trajectory.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A seventh level void G.o.d Realm young man was killed by Xie nianjun without any resistance.</p><p>At the same time, the other one, Xie nianqing, had also killed a youth at the 7th level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s cultivation had broken through two levels, reaching the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The two of them didn’t lack suitable divine skills, and their battle techniques were even more exquisite.</p><p>As their cultivation base increased, their strength would also increase.</p><p>If they were weak and had weak divine power, they would not be able to use many of their techniques. The stronger they were, the more techniques they would have.</p><p>At this moment, it wasn’t hard for them to kill a seventh-level ethereal G.o.d Realm heaven’s favorite.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was not difficult.</p><p>When Lu Ming was at first-stage virtual G.o.d Realm, the activation of the battle formula doubled his combat strength and he was able to fight against a seventh-stage virtual G.o.d.</p><p>After that, he cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture and his use of ruler divine power became stronger. His cultivation had also reached the second level of the ethereal G.o.d Realm, so he could easily deal with those at the seventh level.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, more than ten attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“My Lord!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and circulated his G.o.d’s divine power. Instantly, when the attacks approached Lu Ming, they seemed to be controlled. They all deviated from their trajectories and rushed past Lu Ming.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“Chief sovereign’s divine power … The divine power … He controls chief sovereign’s divine power!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>G.o.d’s divine energy. Lu Ming had actually mastered G.o.d’s divine energy. This was divine-grade divine energy.</p><p>As far as they knew, no one in the younger generation of the Kong Xuan sect had mastered divine-grade divine power. Only the three Overlord forces had peerless geniuses who could master divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Monstrous, a peerless monstrous talent!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming would not let go of this opportunity. He thrust his long spear forward.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had killed five to six paragons with his spear.</p><p>There was even a seventh level ethereal G.o.d Realm heaven’s favorite.</p><p>let’s go, let’s go quickly. We must report this news!</p><p>this person controls divine-grade divine power. He will definitely become the saint’s enemy in the future. We must let the Saint know!</p><p>The bow-wielding young man and the others wanted to retreat.</p><p>“Today, none of you shall think of leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. His killing intent surged like a tide, like a G.o.d of death, and he charged towards these people.</p><p>At the same time, he also released QiuQiu to restrain the enemy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
