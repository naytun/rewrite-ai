He unleashed his potential to the extreme and fought the nether Dragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower.</p><p>All of a sudden, his body burst forth with a resplendent reddish-gold light that was far more resplendent than before.</p><p>The Golden-red armor on his body was originally full of cracks. However, at this moment, the cracks had disappeared. The Golden-red armor shone brightly and looked even more solid.</p><p>He had broken through. At the critical moment, the nine stage Crimson Gold armor had broken through.</p><p>Lu Ming had already cultivated the nine-stage Crimson Gold armor to the peak of the first stage. He had been stuck at the peak of the first stage for some time. However, after the close-quarters combat, his potential was stimulated and he finally broke through.</p><p>nine stage Crimson Gold armor ” had broken through to the second stage, and its defensive power had increased greatly, temporarily blocking the attacks.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not feel happy at all.</p><p>Their defense had been strengthened, but they still couldn’t charge out, because their attack power hadn’t increased.</p><p>They were still surrounded by the netherdragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower and were under constant attack. Lu Ming tried his best to protect Yue Linglong, but if this continued, The Crimson Gold armor’s defense would not be able to hold on for long. It would have been broken long ago.</p><p>“Linglong …”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the sky. Rays of sword light rained down, slashing at the nether Dragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword light was so powerful that it sent many nether Dragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers flying. Then, a figure rushed in.</p><p>It was a handsome young man in a snow-white robe.</p><p>“Wu Zifeng, why are you here? Why are you here?”</p><p>Yue Linglong was extremely surprised to see this young man.</p><p>I’ve come all the way here to look for you. I heard that you might have entered the dark Dragon secret realm, so I came here to look for you. My hard work pays off, and I’ve finally found you!</p><p>The young man rushed to Yue Linglong’s side and said.</p><p>“Why are you so stupid to rush in and die … Be careful!”</p><p>Yue Linglong cried out in shock.</p><p>From all directions, nether Dragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers kept coming at them.</p><p>Wu Zifeng brandished his sword to meet the attack. Sword light burst forth and sent some nether Dragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers flying. His strength was astonishing.</p><p>what powerful combat power! That’s sacred grade divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This Wu Zifeng had actually mastered divine grade divine power. The power of his divine skill was also very shocking.</p><p>He was clearly only at the ninth tier of the void G.o.d Realm, but his combat strength was far above Kuang Dao’s. However, Wu Zifeng’s name was not on the void G.o.d rank.</p><p>the netherdragon beast’s weakness is on its neck. The Dragon Bone flower’s weakness is its stem …</p><p>Lu Ming reminded him.</p><p>Wu Zifeng cast a glance at Lu Ming and nodded slightly. He changed the stance of his sword and attacked the weakness of the nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower. In an instant, a few nether Dragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers were killed.</p><p>With the addition of Wu Zifeng, the pressure on them was a little less, but it was still difficult to rush out.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>From the other side of the canyon, the roars continued, making their faces even uglier.</p><p>More and more netherdragon beasts were charging over.</p><p>The rustling sound of the gra.s.s was endless. More Dragon Bone flowers had arrived.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why are there more and more netherdragon beasts and Dragonbone flowers? and they’re attacking so crazily, as if they don’t care about their lives. I wasn’t that crazy when I came in just now!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng also cried out in alarm.</p><p>It was relatively easier for him to kill his way in, but it was much more difficult to kill his way out now. The netherdragon beast and the Dragonbone flower seemed to be determined to keep them here.</p><p>From afar, the three of them were surrounded by the nether Dragon beasts and the Dragonbone flowers.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was. .h.i.t continuously. His golden armor trembled and cracks appeared on it again.</p><p>Then, more and more cracks appeared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the nether Dragon beast’s sharp claws pierced through Lu Ming’s defense and clawed at his body, tearing off a piece of flesh.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot as he stabbed the nether Dragon beast’s neck with his sword. The sword went through the nether Dragon beast’s neck and blood sprayed out, mixing with Lu Ming’s blood.</p><p>But at this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Runes that looked like small snakes suddenly appeared on Lu Ming’s body. They intertwined and covered his entire body.</p><p>Dark Dragon blood Curse!</p><p>This was the dark Dragon blood Curse that the sect master of Kong Xuan sect had placed on Lu Ming.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>As soon as the netherdragon Blood Curse was cast, all the blood in the netherdragon beast’s body was completely absorbed by it. At that moment, Lu Ming felt a violent force erupting from his body. At the same time, a violent and demonic intent filled Lu Ming’s heart.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and slashed with his sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword had actually split the head of a spirit Dragon beast in half.</p><p>The nether Dragon’s defense was astonishing, but at this moment, it could not withstand Lu Ming’s sword.</p><p>The blood of the nether Dragon beast was completely absorbed by the nether dragon blood Curse. The energy in Lu Ming’s body became even stronger.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot. His killing intent soared to the sky. He kept swinging his combat sword, killing several nether Dragons in a row.</p><p>“This … What’s going on?”</p><p>At the side, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were both dumbfounded.</p><p>Why did Lu Ming’s combat strength suddenly increase so much? He had become invincible.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower roared like thunder. They became even more maniacal. Pairs of red eyes stared at Lu Ming greedily as if they were looking at a rare treasure.</p><p>Then, they charged at Lu Ming in a frenzy, completely abandoning Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong.</p><p>I understand now. The netherdragon beasts and the Dragonbone flower are attacking us so crazily because of the curse mark on his body!</p><p>Yue Linglong suddenly called out.</p><p>indeed, what a strange seal. What kind of seal is this? it looks extremely evil!</p><p>Wu Zifeng also frowned.</p><p>no, he’s going to be drowned. Let’s go save him!</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted, wanting to save Lu Ming.</p><p>don’t come over. You guys go quickly. You guys rush out first!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming also understood what was going on.</p><p>The netherdragon beasts and the Dragonbone flower were besieging them because of Lu Ming. To be more precise, they were besieged because of the netherdragon Blood Curse.</p><p>It could be said that he was completely attracted by the dark Dragon blood Curse.</p><p>It was no wonder that they didn’t even need to look for the nether Dragon beast on their way here.</p><p>Dark Dragon blood Curse, Dark Dragon secret realm, Dark Dragon beast, Dragon Bone flower …</p><p>There must be a connection between all these.</p><p>“No, we came here together. If we leave, we leave together …”</p><p>Yue Linglong called out.</p><p>“You will only be a hindrance if you stay here. You go first, I have a way to get out!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed as he swung his sword, killing a nether Dragon beast.</p><p>The moment the netherdragon beast died, the netherdragon Blood Curse absorbed its blood, causing the energy in Lu Ming’s body to become even more violent.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had a vague feeling that this was not a good thing. The nether dragon blood Curse would become stronger after absorbing the nether Dragon beast’s blood. It would be more difficult for him to break free from the nether dragon blood Curse.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
