Level 20 has lit up!</p><p>“Level twenty-one!”</p><p>At the scene, people kept exclaiming.</p><p>It was obvious that there were terrifying geniuses in this group of people who were extremely fast.</p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>&Nbsp; suddenly, the s.p.a.ce around the tower trembled, and a young serpent-man appeared.</p><p>There was a token floating above the young man’s head, but it was dim.</p><p>It was obvious that this young man had been eliminated. He had been teleported out before he could pa.s.s the thirty-sixth level.</p><p>“Eliminated, leave the square!”</p><p>The bronze-skinned man from before said.</p><p>The serpent-man youth’s face was extremely unsightly.</p><p>Sir, I was careless just now. Can you give me another chance? ”</p><p>The serpent-man youth shouted.</p><p>He was truly unwilling to miss out on such an opportunity. If he could join the Qin heaven thirteen clans, he would be able to soar into the sky.</p><p>“Leave the square, I’ll say it one last time!”</p><p>The bronze-skinned man said coldly, and a cold aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The young serpent-man shivered and didn’t dare to stay any longer, quickly flying out of the square.</p><p>As soon as he flew out of the square, the token above his head disappeared.</p><p>Following that, people were continuously sent out from the surroundings of the giant tower. They were all eliminated.</p><p>Those who had been eliminated had ugly expressions on their faces. They knew that they had lost a great opportunity.</p><p>The pavilion master of Cloud Peak Pavilion and the others watched coldly.</p><p>If he couldn’t even pa.s.s such a selection, even if he partic.i.p.ated in the Qin heaven 13 clans ‘disciple recruitment test, he wouldn’t have a chance of pa.s.sing. He would only be a joke.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more people were eliminated.</p><p>The young men who had not entered the tower were a little nervous.</p><p>However, the light on the giant tower was also getting brighter.</p><p>the thirty-sixth level! Someone has pa.s.sed the thirty-sixth level!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>At this moment, the thirty-sixth level was already shining.</p><p>However, the person who had pa.s.sed the test had not come out yet, so it was obvious that he wanted to continue.</p><p>There was no rule in the pavilion master’s mind that one had to come out after pa.s.sing the 36th level. One could still continue after that.</p><p>The higher one went, the stronger they would be and the more valued they would be by the cloud Peak Pavilion master.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, the thirty-seventh level also lit up.</p><p>However, after the thirty-sixth level lit up, the speed of clearing the levels after that would be much slower.</p><p>Furthermore, more and more people were being teleported out.</p><p>In the end, nearly 9000 people were teleported out, all of whom had failed the trial.</p><p>However, following that, there were also those who had cleared the trial and were teleported out. The tokens on their heads glowed brightly, indicating that they had pa.s.sed the trial.</p><p>Many people looked at these people enviously. Those who had successfully pa.s.sed the round also revealed looks of joy.</p><p>hahaha, this is a disciple of my yellow wind sect. He has pa.s.sed the selection!</p><p>that’s a disciple of my liuyun school. He also pa.s.sed the test!</p><p>Outside the square, some people laughed in surprise. They were all experts from the major forces.</p><p>Some people were happy, while others were sad!</p><p>However, the challenge wasn’t over yet. Half a day pa.s.sed before the last person was teleported out.</p><p>This was a young man with a cold and arrogant expression. He had made it to the 46th level and was the first of this batch of people.</p><p>He had a cold and arrogant look on his face as he scanned the surroundings, giving off the feeling of a Princess.</p><p>with such talent, there’s a high chance that he’ll be chosen by the Qin heavenly thirteen clans!</p><p>“It’s very possible!”</p><p>The experts of the various forces around the square were envious.</p><p>The people from the young man’s force were all ecstatic.</p><p>To be able to rank first out of 10000 people, it was extremely possible that he would be chosen by the Qin heaven 13 clans.</p><p>That’s because the total number of youths in the chaotic astral River who are going to partic.i.p.ate in the selection process is only 50 to 60 thousand.</p><p>Out of the first batch of 10000,9000 were eliminated, and only 1000 or so pa.s.sed.</p><p>The elimination rate was a total of nine levels.</p><p>Those who had not partic.i.p.ated in the challenge were extremely nervous. Some of them were already sweating.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest were very relaxed.</p><p>“Next batch!”</p><p>The cloud Peak Pavilion master instructed.</p><p>Immediately, another ten thousand people flew into the giant tower. Among them, Lu Ming saw Kang long, situ Xiao, and the others.</p><p>After the 10000 people flew into the giant tower, the giant tower closed, and everyone waited patiently.</p><p>The head of the yuanluo Palace, Kang Ji, and the head of the Xiaoyao sect, situ haonan, looked at the tower nervously. Their eyes were filled with antic.i.p.ation and anxiety.</p><p>This time, after only about 20 minutes, someone was eliminated and sent out.</p><p>After that, more and more people were eliminated.</p><p>In the end, more than 9000 people were eliminated.</p><p>&Nbsp; buzz …</p><p>More people were teleported out. Among them were Kang long and situ Xiao.</p><p>However, the tokens above their heads were shining. It was clear that they had pa.s.sed.</p><p>The two of them were full of smiles and excitement.</p><p>When he looked at Lu Ming, his eyes were filled with provocation.</p><p>brat, wait until I join the Qin heaven thirteen clans. I’ll make you die without a burial ground!</p><p>Kang long could not help but send a message to Lu Ming.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up and he revealed a mocking expression. He then looked in another direction and ignored Kang long.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Outside of the Plaza, Kang Ji and situ haonan laughed loudly. They were so excited that their mouths cracked open.</p><p>Especially Kang long and situ haonan. They even looked at the ancestor of technique provocatively, but the ancestor of technique ignored them.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was aware of the talents of Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun. Kang long and the others were nothing.</p><p>The challenge continued. Some people had not come out yet.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, some people had already pa.s.sed the 45th level and were heading towards the 46th level, closing in on the first place of the previous batch.</p><p>Not long after, the forty-sixth floor lit up, and they had already caught up with the best result of the first batch.</p><p>However, it was clear that it had not stopped. The challenge was still going on.</p><p>Then, the forty-seventh, forty-eighth, and forty-ninth levels gradually lit up.</p><p>amazing! There’s actually someone in this group who pa.s.sed the forty-ninth level. Amazing!</p><p>I wonder which faction he’s from. There’s a high chance that he’ll be chosen by the Qin heaven thirteen clans!</p><p>“Look, it’s the 50th floor!”</p><p>In the square, countless people were staring at the giant tower and discussing.</p><p>Even the eyes of the cloud Peak Pavilion master lit up.</p><p>Feng ‘er hasn’t come out yet. Could it be that Feng’ er is inside? ”</p><p>At this moment, situ haonan was excited.</p><p>That was because his son, situ Feng, had not come out.</p><p>The others had all come out.</p><p>Could it be situ Feng who was challenging the tower?</p><p>Thinking of this, situ haonan was extremely excited.</p><p>“Look, it’s level fifty-one!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone was shocked that he had already reached the 51st floor. They were all very curious about who could make it to the 51st floor.</p><p>However, the 51st level was not the limit.</p><p>Fifty-two, fifty-three …</p><p>A day later, the fifty-fifth level lit up. It was almost ten levels higher than the first place of the previous batch.</p><p>This was extremely shocking.</p><p>At this moment, the void around the giant tower trembled and a young man’s figure appeared.</p><p>The token above the young man’s head was shining like a sun.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
