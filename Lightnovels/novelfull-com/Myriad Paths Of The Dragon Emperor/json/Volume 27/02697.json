At this moment, he could only feel his legs trembling and even forgot to escape.</p><p>“Not kill you? You just said that you wanted to kill me …”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A cold killing intent seeped out of his body and enveloped Huang Chengan.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Huang Chengan screamed, turned around, and ran.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not move and he thrust his spear forward.</p><p>A ray of spear light crossed the distance of a thousand miles and pierced towards Huang Chengan.</p><p>Huang Chengan’s defense was pierced through like tofu. His body was pierced through, and blood spurted out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ll die a horrible death. The Saint will not let you off …”</p><p>Huang Chengan roared and then stopped breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was calm. He came above the half-dead LAN Shang and killed her with one shot under her despairing eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming would never show mercy to his enemies. As long as there was a chance, he would kill until the other party was terrified.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he walked past Yue Linglong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your ability is really amazing. You’ve surpa.s.sed me!”</p><p>Yue Linglong followed Lu Ming’s footsteps, blinking her eyes and asking curiously.</p><p>“I was just lucky and managed to master a secret technique that can increase my combat power!”</p><p>Lu Ming casually used a reason to push her away.</p><p>After that, the two of them continued on their way. However, after flying for a while, they did not encounter a single netherdragon. Instead, they encountered quite a few other outer sect disciples.</p><p>It was obvious that there were no more Spirit Dragons in this area. Even if there were, they had all been killed by others.</p><p>The two of them went deep into the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>The terrain was also becoming more and more desolate.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>In the distance, a thunderous roar resounded through the sky.</p><p>The nether Dragon beasts charged toward them with incredible speed. It was as if they had already discovered them from afar.</p><p>these netherdragon beasts are strange. We haven’t even noticed them, but they seem to have noticed us from far away!</p><p>Yue Linglong asked curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little surprised. It was true. For the past few times, the nether Dragon beasts had taken the initiative to attack them. Each time, there were seven, eight, or even a dozen of them.</p><p>But no matter what, this was a good thing. At least they didn’t have to waste time searching.</p><p>However, the next moment, Lu Ming and the rest’s expressions changed.</p><p>In the distance, roars sounded again, rising and falling.</p><p>Then, the void trembled, and nether Dragon beasts appeared in the distance. There were at least a hundred of them.</p><p>More than a hundred nether Dragon beasts stepped through the air and charged toward Lu Ming and the rest. Their momentum was overwhelming.</p><p>“There are so many nether Dragons, run!”</p><p>run! Yue Linglong shouted. She turned around and ran away. Her reaction was so fast.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s reaction was not any slower than hers. He also turned around and ran.</p><p>What a joke. There were too many nether Dragons. There were more than a hundred of them, and all of them were impervious to weapons. Their necks were their only weakness. With so many nether Dragons charging at him, no matter how strong Lu Ming was, he would be dismembered by the chaotic beasts.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon roared as it chased after him.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and one escaping, crossed tens of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted, because other figures had appeared in front of her. They were the other outer sect disciples of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“This fellow is very unkind!”</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s evaluation of Yue Linglong. It was obvious that Yue Linglong wanted to drag the others down to distract the nether Dragon beast. Of course, Lu Ming naturally followed closely behind Yue Linglong.</p><p>“It’s the netherdragon … Nest, there are so many of them, don’t come over!”</p><p>When the outer sect disciples first saw the nether Dragon, they were overjoyed. However, when they realized that there were more than a hundred nether Dragons charging at them, their faces turned pale. They screamed and ran away.</p><p>don’t run! Let’s join forces and fight these netherdragon beasts!</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted.</p><p>“It would be a wonder if you didn’t run. Little girl, don’t come over. Get lost!”</p><p>Those people shouted and ran faster than anyone else.</p><p>“Let’s split up and distract the netherdragon beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Yue Linglong.</p><p>Yue Linglong nodded. Then, the two of them flew in another direction. This way, if a part of the nether Dragon was attracted by those people, the pressure on them would be much lighter.</p><p>However, to their surprise, the nether Dragon beasts did not even look at the others. The hundred-odd nether Dragon beasts continued to chase after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Nest, you can’t play like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>The nether Dragon beasts seemed to be staring at them.</p><p>“Battle formula, activate!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and he continuously triggered the battle formula.</p><p>Not long after, he successfully triggered the ‘battle’ formula that tripled his combat power.</p><p>After triggering the tripled combat strength, Lu Ming’s speed increased by a notch.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Yue Linglong and dashed forward quickly.</p><p>In this way, they gradually pulled away from the nether Dragon. After a while, they finally shook off the nether Dragon completely. They found a quiet place and meditated to recover their divine power.</p><p>After their divine power had recovered, the two of them began to discuss.</p><p>“That’s weird. Why are those netherdragon beasts staring at us?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked, puzzled.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He could not figure this out.</p><p>“Could it be that there’s something on our bodies that’s attracting the nether Dragon?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What’s attracting the nether Dragon?”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes flickered. However, even if the two of them tried to recall, they could not find anything on them that would attract the nether Dragon beast.</p><p>After some time, the two of them left the area and continued to head deeper into the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>However, what left them speechless was that not long after, they ‘lured’ another group of netherdragon beasts to chase after them, and they could only run.</p><p>After they had escaped, they didn’t dare to be too brazen. They carefully approached the secret realm from another direction. This time, there were more than ten netherdragons coming at them.</p><p>There were more than ten netherdragons, but they were not afraid. After a while, they killed the netherdragon and obtained its beast core.</p><p>For the rest of the time, they wandered around the area. As long as they encountered a large number of nether Dragons, they would turn around and run. If there were a small number, they would stop and hunt.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had been in the dark Dragon secret realm for a month and a half.</p><p>They had only been here for three months, and half of it had already pa.s.sed.</p><p>However, he had also gained a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming had more than two hundred beast cores. If he exchanged them for points, he would have more than twenty thousand points. He was getting closer to fifty thousand points.</p><p>The nether Dragon beasts in this territory were lured by them in batches and they were slowly killed. Finally, they were almost done.</p><p>The two of them left the area and continued deeper into the dark Dragon secret realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
