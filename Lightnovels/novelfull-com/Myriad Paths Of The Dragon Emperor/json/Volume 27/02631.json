Of course, one’s own combat skills and combat awareness could also be used.</p><p>He couldn’t even use the battle formula.</p><p>In the outside world, the battle character formula played a huge part in Lu Ming’s ability to cross so many realms and kill his enemies.</p><p>Even if he did not trigger the doubling of combat strength, casting the battle formula would greatly increase Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>Now that he could not use the battle formula, it would have a huge impact on Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ruler’s power, so he was not afraid of any opponent.</p><p>After killing the other party, Lu Ming’s points increased by one point and became two points. His ranking also rose by a few thousand places and he was now at 24897.</p><p>This was just the beginning. Every point difference could make a huge difference, because many people only killed one person and obtained one point.</p><p>Later on, when everyone’s points increased, the number of points they gained would slow down their ranking.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to run on the roofs to attract others.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming’s cultivation and his chaotic astral River badge could really lower one’s guard.</p><p>When the others saw that he came from the chaotic astral River and was at the void transformation stage, they immediately treated Lu Ming as a free point. How could they hold back? they all attacked.</p><p>In fact, there was even a prodigy with King-grade divine power who attacked Lu Ming, but he was killed by Lu Ming one by one and turned into Lu Ming’s points.</p><p>In terms of divine power, these people were not as strong as Lu Ming. Furthermore, their incomplete divine skills were only at the first stage, while Lu Ming’s incomplete divine skill had already been cultivated to the second stage. How could they be Lu Ming’s match?</p><p>Lu Ming’s points rose to twenty-three points very quickly. His ranking also soared to more than two thousand six hundred.</p><p>He was getting closer and closer to the top 100.</p><p>Thousand spirit city!</p><p>that’s fast. Lu Ming’s speed of improvement in the twentieth zone is so fast!</p><p>it’s indeed shocking. He’s already in the 2000s. It hasn’t been long, but if he continues to improve like this, he has a chance of getting into the top 100 in the 20th region!</p><p>I remember that Lu Ming should be from the righteous Army!</p><p>Some people in the chaotic astral River exclaimed. Then, many people looked at the ancestor of technique with envious expressions.</p><p>Even the Yunfeng Pavilion master looked at his patriarch in surprise.</p><p>However, the ancestor of technique’s expression was calm.</p><p>In his heart, Lu Ming was definitely going to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans. If those who controlled the ruler’s power could not join, who else could?</p><p>“Hmph, this is just the beginning. Don’t be happy too early!”</p><p>that’s right. This compet.i.tion will last for three months. If we keep such a high profile now, our points will be reduced by half if we are killed!</p><p>As long as he could find a place and comprehend it properly, he would be able to make a breakthrough.</p><p>As long as his incomplete divine skill reached the third level, his strength would increase greatly, and he would be able to kill his opponents faster.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes scanned the area and he rushed towards a small alley.</p><p>The city that Lu Ming was in was extremely huge. Although Lu Ming had covered a large area over the past few days, he had only been active in a small area of the city.</p><p>After making his way through a few small alleys, Lu Ming arrived at a remote courtyard. He entered the courtyard and closed the door. Lu Ming condensed a long spear with his Dominator’s power and began to cultivate.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear was constantly brandished and thrust out. Lu Ming fumbled and a.n.a.lyzed carefully. His understanding of this spear technique was getting deeper and deeper.</p><p>Killing!</p><p>It was not only the 20th area where Lu Ming was fighting intensely. The other areas were also fighting non-stop.</p><p>Some people were directly teleported out after being killed twice.</p><p>In the sky above Wanling city, the rankings on the 20 screens were constantly changing and flashing.</p><p>However, gradually, a few names became more and more eye-catching, even firmly occupying the first place in different regions.</p><p>Like the Tiger teeth of the Tigermen!</p><p>The Golden Sage of the king Kong race!</p><p>Yang Chong! Linghu ye!</p><p>These few names had occupied the first place in their respective regions not long after the compet.i.tion started, and they had not changed since.</p><p>Hu ya is a heaven’s favorite of the Tiger-Man Tribe that only appears once in a hundred thousand years. It’s said that once he became a martial G.o.d, he mastered the divine grade divine power. He’s extremely powerful. This time, he’s very likely to be in the top three!</p><p>the Golden Saint of the king Kong race isn’t bad either. He also controls divine grade divine power!</p><p>and that yang Chong is also a genius who can control the sacred grade divine power!</p><p>sacred grade divine power! He’s truly a peerless genius!</p><p>Many people were discussing and sighing.</p><p>In the Qin heaven star system, most of the living beings could only control ordinary divine power after breaking through to the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Only an extremely small number of people could control King grade divine power. Such people were already considered pretty good geniuses.</p><p>As for palm force sacred grade divine power, there was very little of it.</p><p>There were not many in the entire Qin Tian Starfield.</p><p>Although the level of divine power could be cultivated through some divine techniques, those divine techniques were extremely rare and the difficulty of cultivating them was also extremely shocking.</p><p>Without exceptional comprehension and talent, it was very difficult to gain anything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
