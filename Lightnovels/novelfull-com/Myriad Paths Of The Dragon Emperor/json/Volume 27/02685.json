No Way</h1><p>Chapter 2685 Chapter 2685-want to return it? no way</p><p>This time, he had earned big!</p><p>He had won two hundred million low-grade divine crystals. If he exchanged them for sect points, he would have a total of twenty thousand points.</p><p>One day of cultivation in the divine pulse tower was one point. Twenty thousand points were enough for Lu Ming to cultivate in the divine pulse tower for more than fifty years.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had only cultivated for three months in the divine pulse tower and his cultivation level had risen from third-level to fourth-level void G.o.d-level. The effect was amazing.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation was, the more difficult it would be to make a breakthrough, and the time required would naturally be much longer.</p><p>However, if he cultivated in the divine pulse tower for more than 50 years, his cultivation would increase by a large margin.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were bleeding when they saw Lu Ming put away the storage ring. That was their divine crystals.</p><p>“My ten million divine gems!”</p><p>An outer Deacon’s face twitched, and his heart was bleeding.</p><p>Although they were all high-level true G.o.ds, tens of millions of low-grade divine crystals was still a considerable amount.</p><p>“Hmph, it won’t be that easy to take my divine crystals!”</p><p>Le snorted coldly and then sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming, ” brat, come to my mansion right away and give me back the 20 million divine crystals. Also, you’ve insulted me just now, so you must be punished. If you give me another 50 million divine crystals as compensation, I’ll let bygones be bygones!</p><p>This voice rang directly in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>A threat, a blatant threat!</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. He looked at the music and his voice spread throughout the entire venue.”Deacon le Zhong, you’re already so old. Don’t you know that you must accept your loss? with your status as a Deacon, you actually threatened me with a voice transmission just now, asking me to return the 20 million divine crystals to you. You also threatened me to pay you another 50 million divine crystals. How can you say something like that?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not try to hide anything. Everyone heard what he said.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned to le Zhong.</p><p>Some people revealed looks of disdain.</p><p>After le Zhong lost the divine crystals, he actually threatened Lu Ming in secret. How despicable.</p><p>“d.a.m.n b.a.s.t.a.r.d, d.a.m.n …”</p><p>&Nbsp; he roared in the center of the music, and his anger was about to burn.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold as to directly say his threatening words, causing him to lose face.</p><p>“Brat, you are playing with fire. You are seeking death …”</p><p>Le sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>look, here he comes again. He’s sending me a voice transmission to threaten me, saying that he’s going to kill me!</p><p>Lu Ming shrieked, then cupped his fists at the three law enforcement elders.”Three elders, a Deacon has threatened this disciple in public. This disciple is truly in fear and trepidation!”</p><p>“Le Zhong …”</p><p>One of the law enforcement elders looked at le Zhong with a cold gaze.</p><p>Le Zhong shivered and quickly shouted, ” “Elder, there’s no such thing. This kid is framing me!”</p><p>“Hmph, it better not be!”</p><p>The law enforcement elder snorted.</p><p>Le Zhong’s face turned gloomy and he didn’t dare to say anything more.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re too greedy. Are you really going to swallow all these divine crystals? I bet all my fortune on it just now. Can you return some to me?”</p><p>At this moment, a young man shouted.</p><p>“Not bad, return some to me!”</p><p>Following that, the others also started shouting.</p><p>Even a few geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking list chimed in. They’d bet a lot just now and had also suffered heavy losses.</p><p>“Return? What a joke. If you weren’t so greedy, how could you have lost to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Return? How was that possible?</p><p>These people had been waiting for him to die. How could he return the divine crystal to them now?</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to know when to stop. I’m only asking you to return a part of it, not all of it. You’ve earned a lot by returning 50 to 60 percent. We’re all senior and junior brothers, so it’ll be easier for you to get along in the future. Otherwise, you’ve offended so many people. Even if you get so many divine crystals, I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to spend them!”</p><p>A yellow-robed young man, a heaven’s favorite on the virtual G.o.d ranking, from the Tian Hong sect, said coldly.</p><p>Although he didn’t make it clear, anyone could hear the threat in his words.</p><p>He was implying that Lu Ming would offend too many people if he swallowed all the divine crystals. He was afraid that he would not be able to spend the divine crystals even if he earned them.</p><p>This time, the three Tribunal Council elders did not say anything. They too felt that it would not do Lu Ming any good to offend so many people at once.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had an extraordinary background, everyone present was under the various saint’s sects. If he offended all of them, he would not have a good time in the future.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>These people clearly lost the bet, their hearts ached, and they wanted to take back a part of it, but what kind of logic was this?</p><p>“Alright, if you want a part of it back, that’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard and many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“All outer sect disciples, I’ll give you a chance. Go up the stage and fight me. Whoever defeats me, I’ll return the divine crystals, but whoever is defeated by me, you have to leave behind something!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>What?</p><p>Most of the outer sect disciples immediately hung their heads in dejection.</p><p>To defeat Lu Ming? You must be joking!</p><p>Did they not see that even Dongfang Hao, who was on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, had been killed by Lu Ming? how could they be his match? Wouldn’t he be looking for a beating if he went up?</p><p>However, some people’s eyes lit up. They were the heaven’s favorites on the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>this battle is only about victory or defeat, not about life or death. Whoever wins, I’ll return double the divine crystals. If you lose, you’ll have to leave behind a treasure. For example, a King-grade divine skill, a level three divine skill, a mid-grade divine artifact, or the corresponding divine crystals. Anything is fine!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again.</p><p>“You said it yourself!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man shouted.</p><p>“With so many people as witnesses, I will keep my word!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll challenge you now!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man moved and rushed into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Huang Chengan is about to make his move!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Huang Chengan was ranked 98th on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, which was more than 20 places higher than Dongfang Hao. His battle strength was also much stronger than Dongfang Hao’s.</p><p>“What kind of treasure are you using to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“A King-grade cultivation technique!”</p><p>Huang Chengan waved his hand and a yellow scroll appeared in his hand.</p><p>“A King-grade cultivation technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture. As long as he cultivated other divine techniques and cultivated a wisp of corresponding divine power, he would be able to light the corresponding divine fire. In the future, as long as he continued to cultivate the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture, his divine power would also improve.</p><p>Lu Ming had wanted to cultivate it for a long time, but he did not have any other amazing techniques.</p><p>Originally, he had wanted to go to the inner sect’s Scripture Depository to exchange for the money he had earned this time.</p><p>“Alright, where’s your receipt? let me see how many divine crystals you’ve bet!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Then, Huang Chengan took out a written pledge of five million divine gems.</p><p>To an ethereal G.o.d Realm expert, five million divine gems was a terrifying number. No wonder Huang Chengan was so anxious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
