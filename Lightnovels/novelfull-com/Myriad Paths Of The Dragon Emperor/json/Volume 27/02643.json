Then, figures appeared one after another.</p><p>There were a total of 13 batches of people, and each batch had three to five people. There were men and women, old and young!</p><p>These were the experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans!</p><p>Many people were shocked and swore to themselves that they would perform well later.</p><p>alright, let’s start the compet.i.tion now. There were two thousand of you, but now there are only one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine of you. One of you hasn’t come yet, but it doesn’t matter. The compet.i.tion later will be random. The Jade talisman will light up at random. The two people who light up at the same time will go up!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. The one missing was naturally dandan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, the Jade talismans above two people’s heads started to shine like two stars.</p><p>“You two, go up and fight!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>Of the two youths, one was a youth from the serpent-men tribe and the other was a genius from the turtle sh.e.l.l tribe.</p><p>The tortoise sh.e.l.l clan was similar to the human clan in every other aspect, except that they had a tortoise sh.e.l.l on their back, and they were known for their defense.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other with cold eyes. Then, they jumped onto the fighting ring at the same time and stood opposite each other.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The young man from the human-snake hybrid clan was the first to make a move. He stomped his feet and his body moved like lightning toward the young man from the turtle sh.e.l.l clan. In his hand, a sword light was thrust at the young man from the turtle sh.e.l.l clan.</p><p>The attacks of the human-snake hybrid clan were fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>However, the young man didn’t panic at all. Grey divine power emanated from his body, and then his limbs and head retracted into the sh.e.l.l.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The serpent-man youth’s long sword stabbed into the turtle sh.e.l.l, causing sparks to fly in all directions. However, the turtle sh.e.l.l only rolled back a few times, and was completely fine.</p><p>“Is it useful to hide in your turtle sh.e.l.l? watch me break your turtle sh.e.l.l!”</p><p>The young man from the serpent-men race said coldly. He kept swinging his long sword, and sword Qi shot toward the young man from the turtle sh.e.l.l race.</p><p>However, the turtle sh.e.l.l was completely fine even when the sword lights slashed at it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The sword light disappeared, and the other party was directly cut in half.</p><p>The two halves of his body turned into energy and disappeared, and then condensed on the stone platforms around the fighting ring.</p><p>His face was pale and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Although he wouldn’t really die if he was killed in the dream s.p.a.ce, that feeling was real. If he was outside, he would have died already.</p><p>He was filled with lingering fear!</p><p>so strong! His incomplete divine skill has already been cultivated to the fourth level!</p><p>and he’s definitely at the peak of the 4th level. Terrifying, too terrifying!</p><p>with the same level of Shen power and the same cultivation, an ordinary person can’t block one sword from him!</p><p>Many people were discussing in shock.</p><p>Situ Feng’s attack made many people’s faces turn grave.</p><p>An incomplete divine skill at the peak of the fourth level was already very high.</p><p>One had to know that incomplete divine skills were harder to cultivate the further one went.</p><p>Although two years had pa.s.sed since the first round of a.s.sessment, most of the people were still in the second and third level.</p><p>This was the first time someone had reached the fourth level. Furthermore, it was at the peak of the fourth level, not far from the fifth level.</p><p>Combined with situ Feng’s King-grade divine power, how many people could be his match?</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>An expert from the Qin heavenly thirteen clans nodded with a smile. He looked at situ Feng and seemed to be tempted.</p><p>The experts from the other sects also looked at situ Feng.</p><p>To be able to cultivate an incomplete divine skill to the peak of the fourth level in just a few years, his comprehension ability was already very high.</p><p>hahaha, big brother is amazing. If Lu Ming were to encounter big brother, he would definitely not be able to withstand a single sword!</p><p>Outside, situ Xiao laughed.</p><p>Situ haonan’s face was also filled with joy.</p><p>“Brother situ, congratulations! The big shots of the thirteen clans just praised you. It’s rare to be praised by the big shots of the thirteen clans!”</p><p>Kang Ji also laughed and flattered.</p><p>Although he was extremely jealous, he naturally had to quickly befriend situ haonan and firmly grasp this ally.</p><p>that’s right, that’s right. Brother situ, with your son’s talent, it’s normal for him to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans ‘three Chiefs!</p><p>“I’m so envious!”</p><p>The other Masters of the other powers in the chaotic astral River also praised him one by one. They wanted to take this opportunity to build a good relationship with situ haonan.</p><p>Situ haonan’s mouth was about to split open from the smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
