Three-Eyed Race!</h1><p>2603 Evil G.o.d race? three-eyed race!</p><p>One had to know that the righteous heaven Army had occupied more than a dozen life planets. There were still some planets that had no living beings, but there were experts guarding them and mining resources.</p><p>How many virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses were there in the entire Righteous Army? there were probably no less than tens of thousands of them.</p><p>And in the entire chaotic astral River, there are at least eight hundred, if not one thousand, forces that are not weaker or stronger than the righteous heavenly Army.</p><p>It was simply difficult to count how many void G.o.d Realm experts there were in the entire chaotic astral River.</p><p>No wonder the primeval universe was also known as the divine realm, the world of deities!</p><p>They stopped at an open s.p.a.ce on Seven Star Island.</p><p>“You guys wait for me here. I’ll go ask where we’re going to be stationed!”</p><p>After saying that, pan Jiang flew into a large hall.</p><p>Not long after, pan Jiang came out of the main hall and said, ” the island we are going to guard is chenjin Island. Follow me!</p><p>Pan Jiang took the lead and flew in one direction, followed by the others.</p><p>On the way, pan Jiang explained the situation of chendao.</p><p>Chenjin Island was located to the North of Seven Star Island. It was an Island with a mineral vein.</p><p>On the island, there was a large aged gold mine.</p><p>Chen Jin was a metal used for refining weapons. Although it was not very precious or rare, it had a wide range of uses.</p><p>Usually, a part of Chen Jin would be added to the forging of low-grade divine weapons as an auxiliary material to increase the toughness of the divine weapon. Therefore, Chen jindao would often be attacked by the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>Chen jindao originally had 600 empty G.o.d Realm experts, but now, it was getting harder and harder to defend, so he needed more help.</p><p>They were the reinforcements for Chen jindao.</p><p>A day later, they arrived at chenjing Island.</p><p>Golden Island wasn’t very big. There was a large mine vein on it, surrounded by many caves. Each cave was guarded by ethereal G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>There were tens of thousands of creatures below the ethereal G.o.d Realm in the mine. They were Mining day and night.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, there were naturally people to receive them and a.s.sign them cave abodes.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming was a.s.signed to a cave abode. The cave abode was quite s.p.a.cious and it was quite rich in divine Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming was just about to sit down and rest.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Outside, the sound of war drums could be heard.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack …”</p><p>Roars reverberated throughout the entire Island.</p><p>“What a coincidence …”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little speechless. They had just arrived and they were attacked.</p><p>Without much time to think, Lu Ming dashed out of the cave abode in a flash.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Deafening rumbles came from the sky above the island. The glints of blades and swords lit up the sky. Divine power of all colors collided in the air. Many people were already fighting fiercely.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and charged at a burly man with wide fangs.</p><p>Each of them had a black metal token with them. The black metal token was both a mission token and an ident.i.ty token. It was bound to their life aura, and once they died, the black metal token would shatter.</p><p>They could distinguish each other’s ident.i.ty through the aura emitted by the black metal token. This way, it would be easy to tell if they were from the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>“Kid, you are only at the transformation void martial stage and you dare to fight with me. I will eat you!”</p><p>The burly man with wide fangs had a murderous look in his eyes. He charged at Lu Ming and slashed with his saber. His aura was not weak. He had a cultivation base of second level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the double combat power of the battle formula. At the same time, he took out the meteor spear and stabbed.</p><p>The meteor spear seemed to have turned into a real meteor. It flashed and then disappeared. The brows of the big man with wide mouth and fangs were directly pierced through, and he died on the spot.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his meteor spear and charged at another yuanluo Palace expert. That expert was at third level void G.o.d Realm, but he was still unable to block Lu Ming’s spear and was stabbed to death.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had broken through to five-star heavenly Emperor, and his combat strength had increased by another level.</p><p>When Lu Ming was a four-star celestial Thearch, he could fight against a fourth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouse with the double combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>Now, with Lu Ming’s cultivation and the double combat power of the battle formula, he could kill a fourth-tier void G.o.d-level powerhouse.</p><p>Of course, he might not be a match for a fifth level void G.o.d Realm powerhouse.</p><p>The main thing was that the gap between each level of cultivation in the heavenly Emperor realm was not as large as the gap between each level in the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>If he wanted to fight against a fifth-level void G.o.d-level existence, Lu Ming would probably need to break through to the six-star heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had killed two people in a row, a burly man with purple skin fixed his eyes on Lu Ming and charged toward him.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>This purple-skinned burly man was using a pair of halberds. When he waved them, the power was terrifying.</p><p>“Peak of the 4th level of the void G.o.d Realm, good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He waved his meteor spear and charged over.</p><p>The long spear vibrated and a dazzling spear radiance burst out, clashing with the purple-skinned burly man.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them clashed madly and exchanged dozens of moves in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The purple-skinned burly man could not withstand the attack and was suppressed by Lu Ming. He retreated continuously.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The purple-skinned man was extremely shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming only had the cultivation of the transformation void martial stage. How could he have such strong combat strength? he was at the peak of the fourth level void G.o.d Realm, yet he was not Lu Ming’s match and was suppressed by Lu Ming. It was simply like a fantasy story.</p><p>The purple-skinned burly man burst out in a frenzy, waving his halberd wildly as he fought Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not enough, not strong enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He did not stop his spear, forcing the other party to retreat.</p><p>An existence at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm couldn’t give him too much pressure, so it was limited in his training.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few more moves, the other party was whipped by Lu Ming’s long spear. His body retreated rapidly and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He thrust his spear at the purple-skinned burly man’s glabella at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The purple-skinned burly man was shocked and retreated frantically. However, his retreating speed could not keep up with Lu Ming’s retreating speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a snow-white Saber Light flashed past. It was extremely fast and accurately cut Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled violently and a terrifying Blade Force followed Lu Ming’s long spear and rushed towards his arm. Lu Ming felt a sharp pain in his palm as if it was about to be cut.</p><p>Lu Ming had to release his power of domination to block the saber Force.</p><p>In the next moment, a skinny old man with purple hair appeared in front of the purple-skinned man. He had three eyes on his forehead.</p><p>“Evil G.o.d tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This old man was very similar to the evil G.o.d race of the evil G.o.d World.</p><p>It was very likely that he was from the same race as the non-human divine ancestor.</p><p>Lu Ming had read up on a lot of information in the righteous Army and knew that there was a race called the three-eyed race in the primeval universe. The evil G.o.d race most likely belonged to the three-eyed race.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
