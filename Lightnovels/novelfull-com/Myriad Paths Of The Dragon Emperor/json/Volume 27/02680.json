A map appeared in his mind. It was a map of the entire inner sect area. The addresses, buildings, and cultivation places were all clearly marked on it.</p><p>“This gold token is quite useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Although he had been cursed by the Dragon Boat Mountain with the dark Dragon blood Curse, at least it was not without any benefits. At the very least, the Golden token was still very useful to him.</p><p>Without the gold token, he would not be able to enter the inner sect area, let alone these cultivation places. It would be difficult for him to make a breakthrough in his cultivation in a short period of time.</p><p>Following the map, Lu Ming walked towards the divine skill Valley.</p><p>The divine skill Valley was the best place to cultivate divine skills in the inner gate area. Of course, it also required points, but it was slightly cheaper, one point for five days of cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ident.i.ty token still had 70 points. It was enough for him to cultivate for 350 days.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the divine skill Valley and devoted himself to cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by and it was getting closer to the one-year agreement between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao. In the blink of an eye, there were only three days left.</p><p>During this period of time, the outer door was bustling with noise and excitement. Many people were discussing Lu Ming.</p><p>A year’s time might not be a short time for ordinary people and they could forget many things. However, for people at the martial G.o.d Realm, a year’s time was no different from a breath’s time. The life-and-death battle between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao was still fresh in their minds.</p><p>“Why hasn’t lu Ming appeared yet?”</p><p>I saw him go out earlier. Did he really slip away? ”</p><p>that must be it. I told you that he’s just asking for death by agreeing to Dongfang Hao’s life-and-death duel. He’s definitely going to run away!</p><p>I heard that he’s the first place in the disciple recruitment a.s.sessment this time. I didn’t know he had no b.a.l.l.s!</p><p>“It would be a wonder if you have the guts to know that you’re going to die!”</p><p>In the outer sect area, everyone was talking about Lu Ming. They all thought that Lu Ming had slipped away and did not dare to accept the challenge.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was coming out from the inner gate area.</p><p>Lu Ming had a smile on his face. He had gained a lot from his cultivation during this period of time. He was very confident in his battle with Dongfang Hao.</p><p>Soon, he returned to the inner court area.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back!”</p><p>Instantly, this piece of news caused an uproar in the outer gate area.</p><p>The people who were certain that Lu Ming had slipped away earlier were dumbfounded and speechless.</p><p>“You still dare to come back? you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>“Simply stupid!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s return was a slap to these people’s faces. These people flew into a rage out of humiliation. They thought that Lu Ming was so foolish that he came back to court death.</p><p>In short, the news of Lu Ming’s return quickly spread to the outer sect.</p><p>In the yellow martial Palace.</p><p>“Good, good, it’s good that he’s back, we can kill him now!”</p><p>Huang Wu laughed.</p><p>“Don’t worry. This time, I’ll make sure he dies a horrible death!”</p><p>On the side, Dongfang Hao’s face was ferocious and his killing intent was cold.</p><p>come, come, come. Place your bets, place your bets. If you bet on Dongfang Hao, it’s 200 to one. If you bet on Lu Ming, it’s 1 to 50!</p><p>Near the life-and-death arena, a burly man had actually started a bet on who would win between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao.</p><p>200 to 1? you’re too greedy. This ratio is too low!</p><p>“That’s right, I bet 200 dollars and only earned one dollar!”</p><p>Many people looked down on him.</p><p>If they bet on Lu Ming winning, they would earn fifty divine crystals for each piece. However, if they bet on Dongfang Hao winning, they would only earn one divine crystal for each piece of divine crystal.</p><p>“If you don’t place your bet, I’ll place mine. Lu Ming is definitely going to lose. Although the ratio of two hundred to one is a little low, it’s a sure win. I’ll bet one hundred thousand divine crystals on Dongfang Hao!”</p><p>An outer sect disciple had placed a bet of 100000 divine gems.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>That’s right, Dongfang Hao was definitely going to win. Even though it wasn’t a lot, it was still a profit.</p><p>I’m also betting on Dongfang Hao! I’m betting 50000 divine gems!</p><p>I’ll bet two hundred thousand divine crystals on Dongfang Hao!</p><p>“I also bet …”</p><p>there’s no doubt about this battle. Dongfang Hao is definitely going to win!</p><p>A large group of outer sect disciples placed their bets on Dongfang Hao.</p><p>The man’s face was covered in cold sweat. He also thought that Dongfang Hao would win for sure.</p><p>Almost everyone had bet on Dongfang Haosheng, so he would lose a lot of money.</p><p>He had deliberately set the odds on Lu Ming at 1:50. With such high odds, he initially thought that some people would take the risk and bet on Lu Ming’s victory. In that case, he would be able to earn a fortune.</p><p>why don’t you guys bet on Lu Ming? if you bet on Lu Ming, you’ll be betting one with fifty!</p><p>The burly man shouted.</p><p>do you think I’m stupid? if I bet on Lu Ming, I’ll definitely lose!</p><p>“That’s right, I’m not giving you money for nothing!”</p><p>“Hurry up and write me a receipt!”</p><p>The group of outer sect disciples clamored, and the burly man broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>“It’s really lively!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just returned from the inner sect area. When he pa.s.sed by and saw so many people placing their bets, he immediately became interested.</p><p>“Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>Someone called out. Immediately, everyone’s eyes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>There were those who were pitying him, those who were sighing, and those who were indifferent. Anyway, they looked at Lu Ming as if he was a dead man. In their opinion, Lu Ming would definitely die in three days.</p><p>“That, this bet, how do you place it? What are the odds?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s interest was piqued. He walked over and asked.</p><p>if you bet on Dongfang Haosheng, the odds are two hundred to one. If you bet on Lu Ming, the odds are one to fifty!</p><p>Someone answered.</p><p>“Nest, my odds are so high? There should be a lot of people who bet on me winning!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the burly man.</p><p>“No, no one is betting on you winning!”</p><p>The burly man said with a bitter face.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was depressed.</p><p>How much did they look down on him? so many people bet on Dongfang Haosheng with a 200-for-1 payout, but he bet with a 50-for-1 payout and no one bet on him?</p><p>Did they all think that he would lose?</p><p>everyone, everyone, because too many people are betting on Dongfang Haosheng, now the odds will be changed. The odds for those who are betting on Dongfang Haosheng will be changed to five hundred to one.</p><p>The burly man shouted.</p><p>“What? 500 to one, Why Don’t You Just Die!”</p><p>if you bet 500 dollars, you’ll only earn 1 dollar. If you bet 50000 dollars, you’ll only earn 100 dollars. That’s too little!</p><p>“It’s not good to be so shameless!”</p><p>Many people questioned loudly, but the middle-aged man’s att.i.tude was firm. He was determined to win 500 to one.</p><p>“This business is not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted and he had an idea. He thought of a way to earn money.</p><p>“Everyone, everyone, please listen to me …”</p><p>Lu Ming clapped his hands to attract everyone’s attention.</p><p>if he’s not the banker, I’ll be the banker. Those who want to place a bet, come to me. If you bet on Dongfang Hao, it’s a hundred for one. If you bet on Lu Ming, it’s a one for one!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“What? If you bet on Dongfang Haosheng, it’s a hundred to one. I’m buying it, I’m buying a hundred thousand divine crystals!”</p><p>Immediately, someone placed a bet.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were also burning.</p><p>The burly man had bet on Dongfang Hao’s victory at a odds of 500 to one, but Lu Ming’s bet was 100 to one. It was five times higher.</p><p>Everyone naturally chose Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
