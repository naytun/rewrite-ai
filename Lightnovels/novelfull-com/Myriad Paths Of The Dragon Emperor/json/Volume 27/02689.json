He just had to continue cultivating the universe thousand Dao formula and that wisp of divine Ice Fire would slowly grow stronger.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a year had pa.s.sed.</p><p>During this year, Lu Ming had been cultivating wholeheartedly. The frost divine fire had finally grown to the size of the ruler’s divine fire.</p><p>In his dantian, two divine flames were burning. It was extremely mysterious.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and circulated the ice divine power. A long spear made of ice appeared in his hand, exuding a bone-chilling cold.</p><p>“Haha, now I don’t have to worry about others discovering my ruler’s divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could use the ice divine power alone. Although it was far less powerful than the ruler’s divine power, it was very practical to fool people.</p><p>Moreover, once Lu Ming used the G.o.d’s divine power, the ice divine power would explode together with the G.o.d’s divine power. The strength of Lu Ming’s divine power was twenty percent stronger than before.</p><p>Don’t look down on 20%. A 20% increase in strength was already very shocking.</p><p>In the future, Lu Ming could continue to cultivate other divine powers. In the future, when the number of divine powers increased and they were stacked, the power would be very shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>I’ve just cultivated two types of divine power. It’s not a good time to continue breaking through the realm. I’d better consolidate and Polish my skills before coming to the divine pulse tower to cultivate!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>One day of cultivation in the divine pulse tower would cost one point, which was equivalent to ten thousand divine crystals. Although Lu Ming was rich now and controlled more than two hundred million divine crystals, he did not want to waste it.</p><p>In the past year, he had spent nearly 400 points. That was four million divine crystals. In the past, Lu Ming would not have been able to afford it.</p><p>it’s said that there are a large number of divine skills, divine techniques, and even secret skills in the Scripture library in the inner court. All of them can be exchanged with points. Let’s go and have a look!</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>He planned to exchange for a few more divine techniques to cultivate.</p><p>Sharpening a knife would not delay the work of cutting wood. Although it would take some time to cultivate the divine technique, this time would not be wasted.</p><p>As long as he cultivated divine fire, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased in the future, the divine fire and divine power would also increase.</p><p>If he were to wait for Lu Ming’s cultivation to improve before he cultivated other divine techniques and powers, it would take him more time to cultivate the divine fire he had just cultivated to the size of the Dominator divine fire.</p><p>His current cultivation level was still low, and the amount of time he had to spend was still little. After he had successfully cultivated it, he could raise his cultivation level in the future. This was the best strategy.</p><p>Lu Ming left the divine pulse tower and walked toward the Scripture chamber.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the Scriptures Depository.</p><p>The sutras Depository was a huge Pavilion. It was five stories high and extremely wide.</p><p>There were naturally people guarding the Scripture chamber, and they were all extremely terrifying powerhouses. However, Lu Ming took out his gold token and entered the Scripture chamber smoothly.</p><p>“So many …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened when he arrived at the first level.</p><p>What came into view were shelves. At a glance, there were at least a few hundred shelves, and on each shelf was a divine skill.</p><p>They were either in the form of Jade talismans or scrolls, but they were all protected by a formation. Only with the permission of The Guardian of the Scripture chamber could they be taken out.</p><p>There was an introduction under the shelf.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at them one by one.</p><p>They were all divine skills, but they were relatively low-level. Most of them were between the first and third levels.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and did not see any that were above the fourth level.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming went to the second level.</p><p>The second level was also filled with G.o.dly skills, but they were of a higher level. Many of them were level four or level five G.o.dly skills. Lu Ming looked around. Other than the G.o.dly skills, he did not find any other amazing techniques or secret skills.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and arrived at the third level.</p><p>On the third floor, the number of divine skills was much, much less. They were all divine skills of the sixth or seventh tier.</p><p>&Nbsp; the value of such a divine skill was already astonishing. Normally, only advanced true G.o.ds or heavenly G.o.ds could cultivate it and unleash its power.</p><p>Similarly, there were no secret skills or divine arts on this floor.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was not the divine skill. He shook his head and went to the fourth level.</p><p>The collection on the fourth floor was even less. However, they were all divine skills of the seventh and eighth levels, and there were only a few dozen of them.</p><p>“Great sun G.o.d technique!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He had finally found a divine technique.</p><p>This divine technique was called the great sun divine technique. It was also a King-grade divine technique and had more mystical points than the ice divine technique. The great sun divine power cultivated from it was also stronger than the ice divine power.</p><p>“Finally, there’s a divine technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and looked through them one by one. He saw more than a dozen King-grade divine arts and techniques, all of which could cultivate King-grade divine power. Each of them had their own mysteries.</p><p>However, the points required to exchange for it were shockingly high. The lowest required 1000 points, while the highest required 5000 points.</p><p>1,000 points were equivalent to 10 million divine gems.</p><p>For example, the great sun Shen technique required three thousand points.</p><p>they’re really valuable. Even if I use up all my divine crystals, I can’t even exchange for a few!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>After watching for a while, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to make a move. He looked at the fifth level.</p><p>If a King-grade wondrous art had appeared on the fourth floor, what kind of treasure would appear on the fifth floor?</p><p>Would there be a Saint-grade Divine Art?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He then stepped onto the fifth level.</p><p>“Ninefold divine skill, and … A secret technique!”</p><p>There were even fewer G.o.dly skills on the fifth floor, only a dozen or so. Moreover, the points required for each step were shockingly high.</p><p>300,000 points!</p><p>Even the cheapest level nine divine skill cost 300000 points, which was equivalent to three billion divine gems.</p><p>Not to mention a true G.o.d, even a heavenly G.o.d would find it difficult to take out so many divine crystals.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped. He could only look at the number of points.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming looked at a few secret skills.</p><p>“Amazing, truly amazing!”</p><p>At one glance, Lu Ming could not help but sigh, his eyes burning with pa.s.sion.</p><p>Secret techniques were different from divine skills.</p><p>Secret skills had all kinds of mysteries. Once they were successfully cultivated, they would accompany the cultivator for the rest of his life and would improve as the cultivator’s cultivation level increased.</p><p>For example, there were some secret skills that, after cultivation, would increase one’s combat power by several times when they were used. This was somewhat similar to the battle formula.</p><p>However, the battle formula was even more mysterious.</p><p>Some secret skills, after cultivation, would have all kinds of strange effects, and their power was even more shocking than divine skills.</p><p>However, there were too few secret skills, and many of them had very harsh conditions to cultivate. Therefore, very few people had successfully cultivated a secret skill.</p><p>The fifth floor contained a few secret techniques, but there was very little introduction, only a few strokes.</p><p>However, the marked price made Lu Ming gasp.</p><p>The cheapest secret skill cost 100000 points, and the most expensive one cost two million points.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
