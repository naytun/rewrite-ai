Lu Ming took the sign down and kept it, indicating that there was someone living there.</p><p>“It seems like I have to break through as soon as possible and reach the void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>On the surface, he didn’t have any expression on his face, but he was actually feeling a little anxious.</p><p>Although he was powerful, this was the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>As one of the Qin heaven thirteen clans, geniuses were as common as clouds.</p><p>Those who could cultivate here were all geniuses. It was difficult to count how many geniuses had been acc.u.mulated over the countless years.</p><p>Only those who failed to become true G.o.ds in a million years would be sent to other planets to take care of some matters.</p><p>In other words, just the outer sect alone already had a million years of heaven’s favorites. How many of them were there?</p><p>Every thousand years, there would be more than a hundred people.</p><p>In a million years, it would exceed a hundred thousand.</p><p>Moreover, the Kong Xuan sect did not solely rely on the once-in-a-Millennium a.s.sessment to recruit disciples. Usually, there were also some powerhouses who traveled to various vital planets to find talented people who could be directly accepted into the sect.</p><p>The number of people who joined in this way was not small.</p><p>Over the past million years, their numbers had also reached a shocking number.</p><p>Even though there were many who had broken through to real G.o.d and become inner disciples, there were still many who stayed.</p><p>It was probably close to 100000 people.</p><p>These people were all powerful and talented. Facing these talents, Lu Ming’s ability to fight above his level would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and meditated.</p><p>At the same time, news of the battle between Lu Ming and Huang Wu had spread among the outer sect disciples.</p><p>“What? A new disciple defeated Huang Wu?”</p><p>Huang Wu’s cultivation is at ethereal G.o.d Realm level five. He has also cultivated the incomplete divine skill to level five. He’s very strong. It’s not easy for a new disciple to defeat Huang Wu!</p><p>he’s indeed not simple. Could he be a heaven’s favorite from some big clan? ”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>After all, the Qin heaven thirteen clans would recruit a batch of disciples every 1000 years. Those with talent and strength would usually partic.i.p.ate. They wouldn’t rely on their age.</p><p>Therefore, those who partic.i.p.ated in the a.s.sessment to recruit disciples had not cultivated for a long time, so their cultivation would not be too deep.</p><p>In the history of the sect, there were not many senior disciples who could defeat Huang Wu as soon as they joined.</p><p>“Wei Qing, you were there too. Do you know Lu Ming’s background and which Galaxy he comes from?” he asked.</p><p>Someone asked a young man who was present at the scene.</p><p>“From the chaotic astral River, I heard him say so himself!”</p><p>Wei Qing said.</p><p>“What? From the chaotic astral River? There’s actually such a person in the chaotic astral River? could it be that his cultivation level has surpa.s.sed Huang Wu’s?”</p><p>Wei Qing, is Lu Ming’s cultivation higher than Huang Wu’s? is he at the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm? otherwise, how could he be Huang Wu’s match? ”</p><p>“The Qin heavenly thirteen clans have never opened up to the chaotic astral River. There are some heaven’s favorites in the chaotic astral River who have trained for close to 10000 years. It’s not impossible for them to reach the 6th level of the void G.o.d Realm!”</p><p>“Yes, that’s definitely the case!”</p><p>Many people were certain that Lu Ming must have cultivated for nearly ten thousand years and his cultivation level must have surpa.s.sed Huang Wu’s to be able to defeat him.</p><p>his cultivation base isn’t higher than Huang Wu’s!</p><p>Wei Qing was speechless.</p><p>“What? Didn’t surpa.s.s Huang Wu? Could he also be at the 5th level of the void G.o.d Realm? He’s at the same level as a Yellow Warrior, and he can defeat a Yellow Warrior when he just entered the sect? Is that for real?”</p><p>One of the older outer sect disciples was in disbelief.</p><p>if that’s the case, then this person’s comprehension ability is astonishing. He must have cultivated the incomplete divine skill to an extremely high level. Or perhaps, he had a fortuitous encounter a long time ago and obtained another incomplete divine skill. He must have cultivated it for many years before he could defeat Huang Wu!</p><p>Another old outer sect disciple guessed.</p><p>“Sigh, let me tell you. That Lu Ming isn’t even on virtual G.o.d-level!”</p><p>Wei Qing said.</p><p>“Not ethereal G.o.d Realm? Wei Qing, you must be mistaken. If he’s not at the ethereal G.o.d Realm, is he at the true G.o.d Realm? a man who has cultivated for less than ten thousand years has reached the true G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>moreover, even if he’s a true G.o.d, he can’t come to the outer sect. I guess he’ll become an inner sect disciple directly!</p><p>Many outer sect disciples looked at him in disdain.</p><p>who said he’s on true G.o.d-level? he’s not a true G.o.d or a virtual G.o.d. He’s a demiG.o.d. Do you guys understand what a demiG.o.d is? ”</p><p>Wei Qing was anxious and said it in one breath.</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Then, the crowd burst into laughter.</p><p>“Hahaha, Wei Qing, are you crazy? A demiG.o.d? A demiG.o.d can defeat Huang Wu?”</p><p>“Wei Qing, are you talking in your sleep?”</p><p>“Do you think we’re three year old kids that can be easily fooled?”</p><p>Everyone scoffed and didn’t believe him at all. They mocked Wei Qing.</p><p>Wei Qing’s face turned red and he shouted, ” that’s the truth. Lu Ming has a demiG.o.d cultivation and he defeated Huang Wu. I wasn’t the only one who saw it. There were others who saw it too!</p><p>also, new outer disciples are required to register at the human affairs Hall within three days to collect their ident.i.ty tokens. They will also be tested for their cultivation. If you don’t believe me, we can wait at the human affairs Hall. When Lu Ming arrives, you’ll know that I’m not lying!</p><p>Seeing Wei Qing’s expression, the others also became silent.</p><p>Could it be that Wei Qing was telling the truth?</p><p>&Nbsp; however, they still found it hard to believe that a demiG.o.d could actually defeat Huang Wu.</p><p>In fact, even Wei Qing himself wouldn’t have believed it if he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>let’s go. We’ll wait at the human affairs Palace. I don’t believe it!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>A group of people headed towards the human affairs Hall and waited there.</p><p>……</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming had recovered to his peak state. He got up and headed to the human affairs Hall.</p><p>The human affairs Hall was an outer sect disciple of the Kong Xuan sect. Everyone knew where it was. Lu Ming found the human affairs Hall easily after asking around.</p><p>The Human Resources Hall was a huge Hall.</p><p>“He’s here. Lu Ming is here. That’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wei Qing pointed at Lu Ming and shouted as soon as he arrived.</p><p>“That kid is Lu Ming? I’d like to see what his cultivation level is.”</p><p>An outer sect disciple extended his spiritual consciousness, wanting to probe Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it instantly. His spiritual sense rushed out and blocked the person’s peeping.</p><p>That person’s spiritual sense retracted and he said, ” he’s discovered us, but he hasn’t found anything. Let’s just wait and see!</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at the group of people and then stepped into the hall.</p><p>Wei Qing and the others followed from a distance.</p><p>In fact, there were many people who were as curious as Wei Qing and the others. They all stood aside and watched as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming came to a counter.</p><p>An elder at the counter looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “Are you a new disciple?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>name, age, from that Galaxy … Report them all!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Lu Ming reported his information.</p><p>put your divine power into this crystal ball. It will test your cultivation!</p><p>The old man took out a crystal ball and pa.s.sed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He took the crystal ball and inserted his divine energy into it. The crystal ball started to glow.</p><p>“DemiG.o.d?”</p><p>The old man was a little surprised. He then registered Lu Ming’s information.</p><p>demiG.o.d, look! It’s really half of his body!</p><p>The old outer disciples who were watching nearby were all dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was really a demiG.o.d.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
