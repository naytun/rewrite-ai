You even dare to kill my floating light Faction’s people, you’re very bold!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao glared at Lu Ming coldly, his cold killing intent enveloping Lu Ming completely.</p><p>“I’m indeed quite bold!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded.</p><p>is that so? since you’re so bold, I’ll issue you a life-and-death duel now. Do you dare to accept it? ”</p><p>A gilded invitation appeared in Dongfang Hao’s hand. With a wave of his hand, the invitation flew toward Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand to receive it. He felt a strong surge of energy surging towards him. His body swayed slightly and he dispelled this energy. He then received the invitation card steadily in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and saw that on the post, there were five big words: A life-and-death duel!</p><p>There were the signatures of two outer sect elders, as well as Dongfang Hao’s signature and fingerprint.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming stamped his thumbprint on it, he would have agreed to the life-and-death duel.</p><p>“What? Dongfang Hao actually issued a death duel invitation to Lu Ming?”</p><p>“I didn’t hear wrong, did I?”</p><p>you didn’t hear wrong. That’s it!</p><p>it can’t be. Dongfang Hao is a person on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Lu Ming has just entered the sect not long ago!</p><p>Dongfang Hao’s words caused a commotion among the outer disciples.</p><p>An expert on the virtual G.o.d ranking list actually issued a life-and-death duel invitation to a disciple who had just entered the sect. This was rare in history.</p><p>“Hehe, you’re really shameless. Ninth level ethereal G.o.d Realm and you dare to challenge a disciple who just entered the sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and mocked.</p><p>“Cut the c.r.a.p, weren’t you very bold just now? Now you’re a coward? If you don’t have the guts to accept it, then get out of the sect!”</p><p>Dongfang Hao berated.</p><p>Many people looked at him with disdain. Dongfang Hao was an expert on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Wasn’t it normal for him to not dare to accept the challenge?</p><p>However, no one dared to speak up.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the life-and-death duel letter in his hands and seemed to be in deep thought.</p><p>did you hear that? if you don’t dare to answer, get out of the sect. My Kong Xuan sect will not keep such a cowardly person!</p><p>Dongfang Hao continued to berate him shamelessly.</p><p>don’t make a fuss here. I’ll sign this life-and-death duel agreement!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s voice was heard. Then, a drop of blood seeped out of his finger and he imprinted his handprint on the mountain of books.</p><p>The surroundings suddenly fell silent.</p><p>He signed it. Lu Ming actually signed it!</p><p>Everyone was stunned. They did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to sign the life and death contract.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Dongfang Hao himself was stunned.</p><p>He had never thought that Lu Ming would sign the life-and-death duel agreement. His original intention was to force Lu Ming to leave the sect and then Huang Wen would send people to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>kid, there’s a time limit to the life-and-death duel. It must be carried out within three years. Otherwise, you’ll be expelled from the sect. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Dongfang Hao said coldly.</p><p>“Three years? There’s no need for three years. We’ll meet on the life-and-death battle stage one year later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>one year, alright, one year later then!</p><p>Dongfang Hao then added a year to the life-and-death duel.</p><p>A year later, if Lu Ming did not dare to accept the challenge, he would be expelled from the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After writing down the date, Dongfang Hao cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and soared into the sky, leaving the place.</p><p>“Lu Ming actually signed it. He doesn’t want to live anymore!”</p><p>“I think he’s deliberately stalling for time!”</p><p>“Buy time? What could he do in a year? He won’t be able to catch up to Dongfang Hao in a year!”</p><p>could it be that he wants to take this opportunity to leave the Kong Xuan sect? ”</p><p>it’s possible. Although he has left the Kong Xuan sect, at least he’s still alive. It’s better than being killed by Dongfang Hao!</p><p>Many people discussed and felt that Lu Ming was deliberately stalling for time.</p><p>In the yellow martial Palace.</p><p>what? that kid actually signed it!</p><p>Huang Wen, Huang Wu, and the others were also surprised when they heard the news.</p><p>They initially thought that Lu Ming would definitely not sign it. Huang Wen’s purpose was to force Lu Ming to leave. Once Lu Ming signed it, his plan was disrupted.</p><p>“This kid is definitely stalling for time and then taking the opportunity to sneak away!”</p><p>Huang Wu said.</p><p>The others nodded and agreed with Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, there was a ten thousand percent chance that he would not be a match for Dongfang Hao in a year’s time.</p><p>what a good plan. However, since Zhen has left, he can forget about coming back in the future!</p><p>Huang Wen said coldly.</p><p>If he left, he would be expelled from the sect.</p><p>one year later, let’s wait and see. If he doesn’t leave, we’ll kill him!</p><p>Huang Wen said. He then left the place and returned to the inner sect.</p><p>A year was too short for a martial G.o.d.</p><p>They did not think that Lu Ming would be able to cause any trouble within a year.</p><p>The news that Lu Ming had signed the life-and-death duel agreement with Dongfang Hao spread among the outer sect disciples rapidly, causing a huge commotion.</p><p>Some people thought that Lu Ming was courting death, but more people thought that he was stalling for time and wanted to take the opportunity to escape.</p><p>In fact, some of them were secretly staring at Lu Ming to see if he was going to slip away.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with all this. He returned to his room and continued cultivating.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“I can continue to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>After a few months of tempering and polishing, his Foundation was already very solid, and he could continue to attack new realms.</p><p>He still had many wood crystals in his hands, but he had not refined them yet.</p><p>He took out a wood crystal, swallowed it, and began to cultivate.</p><p>&Nbsp; he trained in sovereign divine power, and each breakthrough required an astonishing amount of resources.</p><p>However, the wood crystals that Lu Ming had obtained in the abyss and the ones he had obtained after killing the plant life forms were not used. They were enough for him to break through.</p><p>The wood crystals were quickly refined. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was also rising rapidly and he was approaching the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Half a month later, when Lu Ming refined the last wood crystal, his cultivation had successfully broken through to the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>third level void G.o.d Realm isn’t enough to deal with Dongfang Hao!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>When he was at the second level of the virtual G.o.d Realm, Lu Ming could easily defeat powerhouses at the seventh level of the virtual G.o.d Realm, such as the young man in luxurious clothes and the others.</p><p>At that time, his battle-power was equivalent to an eighth level void G.o.d Realm prodigy who controlled King-grade divine power.</p><p>Now that his cultivation had broken through to the third level of the void G.o.d Realm, theoretically, he could fight a ninth level void G.o.d Realm expert if he went all out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming knew that he would most likely not be a match for a ninth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouse.</p><p>This was because 9th level void G.o.d Realm experts could already practice and use divine skills. There was a huge gap between them and 8th level void G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>Once a divine skill was used, one’s battle prowess would be astonishing.</p><p>Moreover, Dongfang Hao was on the virtual G.o.d ranking. His abilities must be even more terrifying. Lu Ming would most likely be no match for him now. Even if he activated the battle character formula to double his combat strength, he would not be a match for him.</p><p>Lu Ming still needed to make more breakthroughs before he could fight Dongfang Hao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
