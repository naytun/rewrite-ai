This kind of comprehension ability was simply terrifying.</p><p>“He must be eliminated!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared in his heart.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was so terrifying. If he were to break through to the fourth level of the true G.o.d stage, how terrible would that be?</p><p>“So what if you’ve cultivated your divine skill to the third level? you’ll still die today!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared and charged towards the ancestor of technique.</p><p>At the same time, situ haonan and Mo kan also charged towards the ancestor of technique. Each of them unleashed their divine skills to their maximum potential.</p><p>“Sword-breaking art!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s sword stabbed out continuously. There were more than ten sword lights that stabbed towards Kang Ji, situ haonan, and Mo kan.</p><p>This was the technique ancestor’s divine technique. It had already been cultivated to the third level, and its power was extremely strong. It continuously collided with the attacks of Kang Ji and the others.</p><p>In the air, the ancestor of technique was forced to retreat.</p><p>However, he still managed to block the attacks from Kang Ji and the others. He was only at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>Kang Ji was extremely shocked. With the power of the three of them, they were actually unable to take down the ancestor of technique. Didn’t that mean that without situ haonan, he and Mo kan were not the ancestor of technique’s match?</p><p>He had to get rid of the ancestor of technique, or else he would not be able to eat or sleep in peace.</p><p>Situ haonan had the same thought.</p><p>The carefree sect’s strength was similar to the yuan Luo Palace.</p><p>The three of them once again charged towards the ancestor of technique.</p><p>The two sides were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>“Force him to the island!”</p><p>During the battle, situ haonan transmitted a message to Kang Ji and Mo kan.</p><p>Kang Ji’s eyes flashed with ferocity. He continued to attack violently, forcing the ancestor of technique towards Chen jindao.</p><p>On chenjin Island, the people from the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect retreated far away, not daring to stay there.</p><p>Slowly, their battle moved to chenjing Island.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a sword light burst out from a hidden place on the island. The sword light was bright and sharp, and its power was extremely shocking. It was not any weaker than situ haonan’s.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>He knew that he had been ambushed, and the other side still had experts to kill him.</p><p>He didn’t need to think to know that it was a Grand Elder of the Walkabout sect, an existence at the fourth level of the true G.o.d stage.</p><p>The ancestor of technique tried his best to Dodge, but Kang Ji and the other two launched a fierce attack, making it difficult for the ancestor of technique to truly Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the end, the ancestor of technique didn’t completely avoid it. A sword light streaked across his chest, almost cutting him to the side.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique roared. In an instant, hundreds of sword lights shot out, forcing Kang Ji and the others to retreat.</p><p>With a flash, Kang Ji and the other three surrounded the ancestor of technique.</p><p>very good. I didn’t expect that the strongest people of your two forces would be here!</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s face was pale.</p><p>Although he had managed to avoid being hit in his vital parts, he had still suffered some injuries and his strength had been reduced.</p><p>“Fa Ming, your fate has already been decided today. A mere ant from a small chiliocosm can’t defy the heavens!”</p><p>Kang Ji coldly said.</p><p>“Hahaha, so what if it’s a small world? Do you think you’re n.o.ble just because you were born in the primeval world? How laughable, if it was a one-on-one battle, you all would be nothing more than clay chickens and pottery dogs!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique laughed coldly, his face filled with contempt.</p><p>Kang Ji and the other three’s faces were a bit gloomy.</p><p>Indeed, none of the four of them were the ancestor of technique’s match in a one-on-one battle.</p><p>Even though their cultivation levels were higher.</p><p>“You only know how to use your tongue. The winner is king and the loser is a Bandit. Fa Ming, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Kang Ji didn’t waste any more words and his figure rushed towards the ancestor of technique.</p><p>At the same time, situ haonan and the other two also launched their attacks.</p><p>Before this, the ancestor of technique had fought three people alone and was not a match for them. Now that he was injured, he was even less of a match for four people alone. He was at a disadvantage the moment they started fighting.</p><p>“General Zheng Tian is finished!”</p><p>in the future, the territory of the righteous Army will belong to our two families!</p><p>Not far away, the people from the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect thought excitedly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The ancestor of technique and the other four fought intensely. The ancestor of technique was completely at a disadvantage and could only try his best to block. He had no power to fight back.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After exchanging dozens of blows, the ancestor of technique’s body was sent flying and crashed heavily into Chen Jin’s Island.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Smoke and dust filled the air, and the sky was filled with ancient gold ore. A huge pit appeared on the island.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had already pa.s.sed through the hurricane pa.s.sage and returned to the chengjin ore vein.</p><p>He followed the tunnel of the mine QiuQiu had dug out earlier and headed out of chenjing Island.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He was only halfway there when a violent boom came from above. Then, he felt the entire Island shaking. Then, a terrifying force rushed toward him along the mine vein above.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated frantically. Then, the mine vein in the area exploded continuously. Lu Ming was sent flying by a force.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was lying in the deep pit on the island, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>This attack made his injuries a little worse.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ancestor of technique barely managed to stabilize his injuries and rushed out of the deep pit.</p><p>The auras of Kang Ji and the other three firmly locked onto the ancestor of technique, trapping him in the middle.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, Kang Ji and the others were stunned because they felt an aura of life within a pile of rocks.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the rocks exploded and a figure rushed out.</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had also encountered an undeserved disaster when he pa.s.sed through the old gold mine.</p><p>When his gaze swept across Kang Ji and the rest, his heart skipped a beat. He knew that this was bad. Kang Ji and the rest’s aura was too terrifying. In Lu Ming’s opinion, they were simply unfathomable.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why are you here?”</p><p>At this moment, the ancestor of technique also saw Lu Ming. He was shocked. In a flash, he appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see the ancestor of technique.</p><p>so you’re an ant from the righteous Army. Fa Ming, it’s your fortune to have a little brat die with you!</p><p>Kang Ji coldly said. The ferocity in his eyes became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Kang Ji, the master of the yuan Luo Palace …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and many thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>He roughly knew what had happened. The ancestor of technique was being surrounded!</p><p>“Don’t worry, fa Ming. After you die, I’ll send the people of the righteous Army to accompany you!”</p><p>Situ haonan also said coldly.</p><p>The four of them gradually approached the ancestor of technique, preparing to launch a thunderous attack to kill him.</p><p>“Senior, this battle sword is for you!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out a combat sword and handed it to the ancestor of technique.</p><p>This combat sword was one of the two level Seven middle-grade divine artifacts that Lu Ming had obtained from the cave abode.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The moment he saw the sword, the ancestor of technique’s eyes widened in shock. However, he did not hesitate. He took it and spat a mouthful of blood onto the sword.</p><p>He didn’t have time to refine it now, but by sacrificing it with blood, he could temporarily release the power of the combat sword and control it freely.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Battle Sword shook, and a beam of sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
