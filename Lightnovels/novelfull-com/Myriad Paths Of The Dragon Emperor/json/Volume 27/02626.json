It was a grand event in the hearts of countless geniuses in the Qin heaven star region. It was also the day when countless geniuses would soar to the sky.</p><p>Soon, there were only three days left before the a.s.sessment!</p><p>On this day, the sound of bells rang throughout the city.</p><p>let’s go. It’s a gathering order from the Qin heaven thirteen clans. It’s time to announce the rules of the a.s.sessment!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said. He led Lu Ming and the rest in the direction of the bell.</p><p>In the middle of Wanling city, there was a vast open s.p.a.ce. It was originally a huge market, but during this period of time, the market was removed and used for the a.s.sessment.</p><p>This open s.p.a.ce was too big. It would not be a problem to accommodate hundreds of millions of people at the same time.</p><p>Very quickly, this open s.p.a.ce was already filled with people.</p><p>Not only were there Young heaven’s pride experts who wanted to take part in the a.s.sessment, but there were also many people who wanted to watch the fun.</p><p>In fact, there were more people who came to watch the show than those who partic.i.p.ated in the a.s.sessment.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a few figures suddenly appeared in the sky, and the scene quieted down.</p><p>there are three more days before the examination. Now, I’ll explain the details of the examination and the rules!</p><p>In the sky, an imposing man spoke.</p><p>The scene was silent. Everyone listened quietly, afraid to miss any details.</p><p>each of you should have an ident.i.ty Jade token to partic.i.p.ate in the examination!</p><p>The middle-aged man took out a Jade card. It was almost the same as the one Lu Ming and the rest had. The only difference was the pattern on it.</p><p>three days from now, when the time for the test is up, as long as you are within Wanling city, no matter where you are, this Jade token will bring you to a virtual s.p.a.ce. We call it the dream s.p.a.ce!</p><p>in the dream s.p.a.ce, everything is virtual. Only your consciousness can enter it. Furthermore, your cultivation will be suppressed to 1st level void G.o.d Realm in the dream s.p.a.ce!</p><p>if you’re already at the 1st level of the void G.o.d Realm, then it won’t change. If you’re not at the 1st level of the void G.o.d Realm, it won’t change either!</p><p>however, although your cultivation has been suppressed to first level void G.o.d Realm, the attributes of your divine power will not change. If you control King grade divine power, it will still be King grade divine power inside. If you control sacred grade divine power, it will still be sacred grade divine power!</p><p>there are two rounds in the test. In the first round, the dream realm will be divided into twenty areas. All the partic.i.p.ants will be evenly divided into twenty areas and fight!</p><p>however, there’s one thing that you can rest a.s.sured about. Before you enter the 20 regions to fight, you will enter a special region. There are many incomplete divine skills there. These incomplete divine skills can be cultivated to the point where they can burst out with power even if you’re at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>from now on, you will have a year to comprehend the incomplete divine skill. Then, you will enter the twenty regions and fight to determine the ranking!</p><p>this time, we’ve calculated that the entire Qin Tian Galaxy, hundreds of galaxies, has a total of about a million people partic.i.p.ating in the a.s.sessment. At that time, each region will have 50000 people!</p><p>50000 people will kill each other. The rule is that every time you kill an opponent, you will get one point. At the same time, you will take half of the opponent’s points. Each person has two lives, which is two chances!</p><p>in the end, only the top 100 of each region can partic.i.p.ate in the next round. Those who don’t make it into the top 100 will be eliminated!</p><p>The middle-aged man explained all of the rules in one breath. After he was done, he stopped and allowed everyone to digest them.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he made a conclusion in his heart.</p><p>The a.s.sessment this time was very simple. It was divided into two rounds.</p><p>There would be around one million people partic.i.p.ating. The Jade card would bring them into the dream s.p.a.ce. If they were killed in there, they wouldn’t really die. Their cultivation would be suppressed to first-level ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Of course, for people like Lu Ming who were below first-level virtual G.o.d-level, they could only keep it as it was.</p><p>Then, they would have a year to comprehend the incomplete divine skill, and the one million or so people would enter twenty regions. Each region would have fifty thousand or so people, and the fifty thousand or so people would fight each other to obtain points. Only the top 100 people would be able to enter the next round.</p><p>Furthermore, each person had two chances.</p><p>This was also for the sake of fairness. It would be a bit of a waste if some geniuses were killed by a powerful enemy from the beginning.</p><p>there are actually over a million people partic.i.p.ating!</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly shocked.</p><p>After a while, when everyone had digested the information, the middle-aged man continued.</p><p>those who are eliminated in the first round might have a chance to join the Qin Tian thirteen clans. As long as you perform well and obtain higher points, you will have a chance to be selected by the thirteen clans!</p><p>“Of course, the better you perform, the more attention you’ll receive!”</p><p>alright, let’s get to the point. The specific rules will be shown on your Jade tokens. Take a good look at it. Do you have any questions? ”</p><p>After the middle-aged man finished speaking, he swept his gaze across the entire scene.</p><p>“Senior, I have a question!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man spoke.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>senior, why did you suppress your cultivation to the 1st level of the void G.o.d Realm? if I cultivate to the 6th level of the void G.o.d Realm, won’t I be unable to unleash my full power? ”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm? Do you think you’re a genius?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>The young man didn’t say anything, but his expression clearly showed that he agreed.</p><p>cultivation will never represent one’s talent. I can tell you that within the Qin heaven 13 clans, there are plenty of people who have reached the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm within 10000 years of cultivation. You can find them all over the streets!</p><p>“There are many true body realm experts who have cultivated for less than 10000 years. Some of them have even reached the heavenly G.o.d Realm. What is a ninth level void G.o.d Realm expert like you?”</p><p>“Would the Qin heavenly thirteen clans lack a sixth level void G.o.d Realm expert? As long as the Qin heavenly thirteen clans give the order, how many sixth level void G.o.d Realm existences can the Qin Heavenly Star system gather?”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s repeated questions made the young man speechless.</p><p>there are many ways to increase one’s cultivation. There are heavenly treasures, fortuitous encounters, or long periods of cultivation. Therefore, cultivation is of no use to the Qin heaven thirteen clans!</p><p>when the Qin heaven thirteen clans recruit disciples, they look at talent, potential, and cultivation. There are plenty of ways to raise it!</p><p>I’ll suppress all of your cultivation to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm and give you one year to test your talent and comprehension!</p><p>“Only those with high talent and comprehension can join the Qin heavenly thirteen clans. Do you understand?”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>The young man’s face turned red, but he didn’t say anything. He came from a big force and had consumed countless natural treasures to reach his current cultivation level.</p><p>However, in the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, would there be a lack of natural treasures?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
