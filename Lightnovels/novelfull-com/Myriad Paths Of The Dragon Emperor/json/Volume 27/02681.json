No one was willing to bet. Now that Lu Ming’s bet was 1:1, who would still bet?</p><p>wait, we’ll bet on you. If you’re killed by Dongfang Hao, who will we go to for the divine crystals? ”</p><p>that’s right. When you’re killed by Dongfang Hao, all your treasures will be his. Who are we going to get them from? ”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>Indeed, when Lu Ming died in battle, they would not be able to get back the divine crystals they had bet with interest.</p><p>“How about this? I’ll find an elder of the Tribunal Council to be my witness and hand over all the divine crystals. If I die in battle, you can go to the elder to collect the divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Find an elder of the Tribunal Council as a witness? Who Do You Think You Are? You’re able to invite an elder of the Tribunal Council?”</p><p>“You don’t even need a draft to brag!”</p><p>Many people looked down on him.</p><p>The enforcement Hall’s elders were high and mighty. How could Lu Ming, a new outer sect disciple, be able to invite them?</p><p>“We’ll know if I can or not after a while. You guys wait for me here, I’ll be right back!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming rose into the air and headed for the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>There was an enforcement Hall in both the inner and outer gates.</p><p>The law enforcement Hall was in charge of law enforcement. It had great power and its words were final.</p><p>Lu Ming really went to invite the elders of the enforcement Hall. Can he really invite them? ”</p><p>“How is that possible? Do you believe that I can invite the sect master just as he can invite the magic elders?”</p><p>regardless of whether it’s true or not, let’s just wait for a while. It won’t take much time anyway!</p><p>The crowd discussed and waited. The news of Lu Ming being the banker and placing bets had spread. More outer sect disciples had gathered in this area.</p><p>It even attracted some outer sect deacons and elders.</p><p>Soon, a huge Palace appeared in front of Lu Ming. This was the outer law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At the entrance of the law enforcement Hall, two young men stopped Lu Ming.</p><p>“I would like to see the enforcement Palace’s elder!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re just a fourth level ethereal G.o.d Realm warrior. You want to meet an elder of the Tribunal Council? What a joke, get lost!”</p><p>A young man waved his hand, his att.i.tude was bad.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He was clear that those who held positions in the Tribunal Council were not outer sect disciples, but inner sect disciples. They were all at the true G.o.d Realm or above, otherwise, how could they suppress so many outer sect disciples?</p><p>It was normal for these people to look down on him.</p><p>“The two of you, you can just go and report!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><p>report? Who Do You Think You Are? on what basis do you want us to report? ”</p><p>It was still the same young man who sneered coldly.</p><p>The people of the enforcement Hall had great power. Most of the outer sect disciples were trembling with fear when they saw them. However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm when he saw them. This made them a little unhappy.</p><p>“With this, is it okay?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and took out the gold token.</p><p>“Why is it useless … What? Yellow … Gold token?”</p><p>The young man was arrogant at first, but when he saw the Golden token, he almost bit his tongue and his eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“Now, go and pa.s.s the message!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a sullen face.</p><p>yes, yes, yes. I failed to recognize Mount Tai just now. This young master, I hope that a great man like you will not hold a grudge against me and not lower yourself to my level!</p><p>The young man who berated Lu Ming earlier broke out in a cold sweat. He bowed his head in fear and trepidation.</p><p>He knew very well that whoever had a golden token was definitely someone with a great background. He couldn’t afford to offend them.</p><p>He wished that he could slap himself. He hated himself for having a cheap mouth just now. He did not know how Lu Ming would deal with him.</p><p>“Go and pa.s.s the message!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Yes, yes, please wait a moment!”</p><p>The young man nodded and bowed, then quickly ran in to pa.s.s on the message.</p><p>Not long after, three old men in Black robes inlaid with gold followed the young man out.</p><p>These three old men were the outer sect enforcement Hall’s elders.</p><p>Black robes with gold embellishments were their symbol.</p><p>“Little brother, do you really have a gold token?”</p><p>One of the elders looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the gold token again.</p><p>“It really is a gold token!”</p><p>The three old men looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.</p><p>“Little brother, why are you looking for us?”</p><p>An elder said with a pleasant expression.</p><p>As the enforcement Hall’s elders, they knew much more inside information.</p><p>They knew very well that only the sect master and a few Grand Supreme elders had the Golden token of the Kong Xuan sect. Lu Ming was young and his cultivation level was not high, but he actually had a golden token. It was obvious that he had an unusual relationship with the sect master or the Grand Supreme elders. Naturally, they had to curry favor with him.</p><p>“Seniors, it’s like this …”</p><p>Lu Ming told them about his intention to set up a bet and asked them to be the witnesses.</p><p>“So it’s this matter. This is a small matter, we’ll go with you!”</p><p>“That’s right, it’s a small matter!”</p><p>The few elders were all smiles.</p><p>The eyelids of the two young men guarding the door twitched.</p><p>They could swear to the heavens that if anyone else dared to come and find the three law enforcement elders to witness such a ridiculous thing, they would definitely be slapped to death by them.</p><p>However, they were not displeased with Lu Ming at all. It was all because of the gold token.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“A small matter, just a small matter!”</p><p>A few enforcement Hall elders smiled amicably, then flew toward the outer gate area with Lu Ming.</p><p>More and more people gathered around the life-and-death battle stage in the outer gate area.</p><p>&Nbsp; Huang Wu, Huang Wen, Dongfang Hao, and the others had also arrived.</p><p>“He’s here, Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone looked in the same direction.</p><p>Then, everyone’s eyes couldn’t help but widen.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming were three old men in Black robes inlaid with gold. They were all too familiar to the outer sect disciples. They were the elders of the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“Nest, are my eyes playing tricks on me? are those really elders of the Tribunal Council? and there are three of them?”</p><p>I’m f * cking super! Your eyes aren’t playing tricks on you. I saw it too!</p><p>“My G.o.d, what’s this kid’s background? he’s actually able to invite an elder of the enforcement Palace!”</p><p>The people who were certain that Lu Ming would not be able to invite the enforcement Hall’s elder felt as if their throats were blocked by a ball of dog fur. Their faces were flushed red.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Huang Wen, Huang Wu, and the rest narrowed their eyes. They could not help but guess that Lu Ming had some kind of background.</p><p>Then, they all shook their heads. They had inquired about Lu Ming’s background. He was just an outer sect disciple who had just entered the sect. He was talented but he did not have any background.</p><p>no matter what methods he used, he will die in a few days!</p><p>Dongfang Hao said coldly. He had absolute confidence in himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
