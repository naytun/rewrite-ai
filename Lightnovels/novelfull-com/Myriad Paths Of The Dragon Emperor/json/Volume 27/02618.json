Some people found that the deeper they went, the more tunnels there were, criss-crossing each other. The further they went, the stronger the wind pa.s.sages would become. Even a true G.o.d expert wouldn’t be able to get in.</p><p>Later on, the pavilion master of the Yunfeng Pavilion, who was a heavenly G.o.d expert, took action personally. He broke into the depths of the cave and was said to have obtained some treasures. As for what he had obtained, no one knew.</p><p>This matter finally came to an end after the pavilion master barged into the cave abode and took the treasures.</p><p>In the end, the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect didn’t get anything.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan were extremely furious. They wanted to kill the ancestor of technique and destroy the righteous Army.</p><p>But in the end, they didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>They were actively looking for allies, hoping to find more to destroy the righteous Army.</p><p>Of course, the ancestor of technique wasn’t idle either. He was also looking for allies to fight against the yuanluo Palace and the Walkabout sect.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help much in this regard. He could only focus on cultivation.</p><p>In the hurricane pa.s.sage of the G.o.d’s cave abode, Lu Ming’s cultivation level rose by two levels, and he reached the seven-star heavenly Emperor level.</p><p>Next, he only needed to consolidate his Foundation and advance towards the realm of 10000 elements return to one.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s comprehension of the battle character had also reached a peak after two years of intense battle with the lion-headed Eagle beast in the hurricane pa.s.sage.</p><p>Now, he could trigger the double combat power at any time.</p><p>A hundred percent success rate.</p><p>However, the word ‘battle’ in his sea of consciousness was unfathomable and mysterious. Lu Ming understood that he was still far from comprehending it. Right now, he had only comprehended a tiny bit.</p><p>If he continued to study, Lu Ming felt that he could trigger the tripled combat strength.</p><p>However, it was not that easy to trigger the tripled combat strength. Lu Ming had reached a bottleneck and needed time to understand.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three years had pa.s.sed.</p><p>After three years of cultivation, although Lu Ming had yet to attain demiG.o.d-level, he could feel that he was getting closer and closer to it.</p><p>On this day, a piece of news was spread throughout the chaotic astral River, causing a violent shock.</p><p>All the forces, big and small, went crazy and exploded.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he received a message from the ancestor of techniques. The ancestor of techniques had something important and wanted to see him.</p><p>“Is there something important?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. Then, he came to a Hall in the righteous Army and realized that there were already five to six people waiting there.</p><p>The five or six of them were not very old. Their cultivation time should not exceed 10000 years. They were all considered to be of the younger generation.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was among them.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er smiled and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>The others also nodded at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in response. He then looked at Tong Xi ‘er and said, ” “Miss Xi ‘er, may I ask why the general has summoned us?”</p><p>“I don’t know either!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er shook her head.</p><p>The others were also confused.</p><p>“You’re all here!”</p><p>At this moment, the ancestor of technique walked into the hall.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>Everyone bowed.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique waved his hand. you guys must be very curious. Why did I call you guys over in such a hurry? ” he asked.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded.</p><p>“You guys should know that our chaotic astral River belongs to the Qin heaven star field, right?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded again.</p><p>At the same time, he felt a little strange in his heart. Could the matter this time be related to the Qin heaven Starfield?</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, there are hundreds and thousands of forces, big and small, countless planets, and an incomparably vast territory.</p><p>However, when compared to the Qin heaven Starfield, there was no way to compare.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region contained many galaxies, at least a few hundred of them.</p><p>The chaotic astral River was only one of the many astral rivers in the Qin heaven Galaxy. Furthermore, it was the worst and most backward one.</p><p>The number of experts was also the smallest.</p><p>What did the ancestor of technique’s gathering have to do with the Qin heaven Starfield?</p><p>the Qin heaven Star Domain is too vast. There are hundreds of galaxies, and there are many races living there. There are countless experts!</p><p>however, among these countless forces, other than a few terrifying races, the most powerful forces are the thirteen clans!</p><p>Qin Tian Starfield’s thirteen clans!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er and the other young men exclaimed in unison.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He had read the records in the ancient books.</p><p>The Qin heaven Star domain’s thirteen clans were thirteen extremely powerful, extremely long-established, and extremely terrifying clans.</p><p>It could be said that other than a few terrifying races, the thirteen clans stood at the peak of the vast Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>These 13 sects were divided into three overlords and ten top sects.</p><p>Without a doubt, the three overlords were the strongest, followed by the top ten sects. These 13 sects occupied half of the Qin heaven star region and had countless life planets. They had ruled the Qin heaven star region for countless years.</p><p>Forces like the righteous heaven Army, the origin Luo Palace, and the Walkabout sect were like ants in front of the thirteen clans.</p><p>Even the number one power in the chaotic astral River, the Yunfeng Pavilion, is no different from an ant in front of the 13 clans. They can be destroyed with a flip of their hands.</p><p>To the people of the chaotic astral River, the thirteen clans were merely a legend. They had only read about them in the ancient records.</p><p>that’s right. Every 1000 years, the 13 clans of the Qin heaven Star Zone will recruit a batch of disciples from the entire Qin heaven Star Zone. Now, the 1000-year period is about to end again!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said. At this point, he paused.</p><p>“The Qin heavenly thirteen clans are recruiting disciples!”</p><p>The breathing of Tong Xi ‘er and the others became heavy, but they were also puzzled.</p><p>“General, I’ve read the records. Every 1000 years, the Qin heavenly thirteen clans will recruit a new batch of disciples. However, they have never recruited any disciples from the chaotic astral River. What does this have to do with us?”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er asked.</p><p>The chaotic astral River was the most backward, remote and weakest among the many galaxies in the Qin heaven Galaxy.</p><p>Those from various races and powers who can’t survive or those who have committed crimes have all run to the chaotic astral River.</p><p>Therefore, the chaotic astral River is a chaotic place where good and bad are mixed together. It’s extremely chaotic and has always been looked down upon by the other galaxies. The Qin heaven star region’s thirteen clans have never accepted any disciples from the chaotic astral River.</p><p>Therefore, Tong Xi ‘er and the others had some doubts.</p><p>“This time, it’s different. The Qin heaven thirteen clans have announced to the world that they will be recruiting disciples from the entire Qin heaven star field soon. The chaotic astral River will be among them!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“Also for the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er and the other young men’s breathing became heavy, and their eyes burned with fire.</p><p>They were all excited!</p><p>This time, the Qin heaven’s thirteen clans had actually opened their doors to the chaotic astral River for the first time ever. If one could join any of the Qin heaven’s thirteen clans, that would be a heavenly opportunity. In the future, one’s cultivation level would definitely skyrocket, and one would become a man above all.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, heavenly deities were synonymous with invincibility. However, in the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, heavenly deities were nothing. One could easily find a large handful of them.</p><p>There were even many terrifying existences at the G.o.dking realm in the Qin heavenly thirteen clans.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
