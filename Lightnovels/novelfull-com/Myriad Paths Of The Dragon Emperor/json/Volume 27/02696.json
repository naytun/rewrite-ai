However, his situation was much better than LAN Shang’s.</p><p>When he hit the mountain, he stomped on it with both legs. The mountain rumbled, cracked, and then exploded. Kuang Dao used the force of the stomp to rush into the sky again.</p><p>However, at this moment, Kuang Dao looked a little embarra.s.sed.</p><p>His hair was disheveled and blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth. Cracks appeared on his black Armor and Blood was oozing out.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>On the side, Huang Chengan was trembling in fear. He could not believe it.</p><p>Kuang Dao was ranked fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. His combat strength had almost reached the peak of the virtual G.o.d-level and he had defeated many experts at the LV 1 true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, there were only a few virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses who could defeat Kuang Dao.</p><p>But now, in the battle between Lu Ming and Kuang Dao, Lu Ming actually had the upper hand. The collision between the two ended with Kuang Dao being injured.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had only joined the sect a few years ago. His cultivation base was still far from peak-stage virtual G.o.d-level. If Lu Ming’s cultivation base were to be raised to peak-stage virtual G.o.d-level, how terrifying would his combat strength be?</p><p>“This mad Daoist does have some strength!”</p><p>Looking at Kuang Dao who was not far away, Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he could kill an ordinary ninth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm cultivator in one move. However, his attack just now was blocked by Kuang Dao.</p><p>However, Lu Ming knew that the mad man had not used his full strength.</p><p>The fighting power that mad path had displayed so far was not enough for him to defeat a real G.o.d.</p><p>Even if they were ordinary true G.o.ds.</p><p>you must have some trump cards that you haven’t used yet. Use them all. Otherwise, you’re not my match! Lu Ming said faintly. He was looking forward to seeing how powerful the fifth virtual G.o.d on the virtual G.o.d List would be if he went all out.</p><p>That was because he hadn’t used his full strength either. The ‘battle’ formula hadn’t been activated yet, either doubling or tripling his combat power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it seems that I’ve really underestimated you. Your abilities are beyond my expectations. Now, you’ll have to suffer all my wrath!”</p><p>Kuang Dao’s eyes flickered with madness. His thick anger was about to spread out.</p><p>He didn’t know how many years it had been since a void G.o.d Realm expert had forced him into this state.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, there were only a few virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses who were stronger than him. He did not usually fight with those few people, and he was almost invincible among virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had made him bleed. He wanted to pay him back tenfold or even hundredfold.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Suddenly, Kuang Dao roared and his hair stood up. His aura suddenly erupted like a volcano and increased by a large amount.</p><p>“This is … A secret skill, a secret skill that can temporarily increase one’s combat strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>tyrannical divine fist! Fist rules the world!</p><p>Kuang Dao roared. His entire body was like a mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming. He punched out with both fists, the force of his punches like mountains.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear. Spear shadows that were as thick as a mountain range were blasted out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, there were constant rumbles as the two of them fought intensely. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than ten moves.</p><p>what an amazing secret skill! His combat strength has doubled!</p><p>In the midst of the fight, Lu Ming could tell that the secret skill of the Mad Dao had doubled his combat strength. This ‘battle formula’ was very similar.</p><p>However, the secret technique of the Mad path was naturally far from being comparable to the ‘battle formula’.</p><p>For a secret skill like madness path, not only did it not have any side effects, but its limit was that one’s combat power would only double.</p><p>However, there was no limit to the battle symbol art. As Lu Ming continued to comprehend, the power of the battle symbol art would become stronger.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could trigger a threefold increase in combat strength. In the future, it was possible for him to trigger a fourfold increase, a fivefold increase, a sixfold increase, and so on.</p><p>The word ‘battle’ in his sea of consciousness was simply a treasure, a treasure that could be excavated limitlessly.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared. His long hair fluttered in the wind and his aura was wild. His killing intent was as cold as a blade. His secret skill did have a flaw. It had a time limit. Once the time was up, it would fall back to its previous level.</p><p>Therefore, he had to kill Lu Ming before the time came.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few more moves, and the battle was intense.</p><p>“It seems that this is your limit. Then I won’t waste time with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, the double combat power of the battle character formula was activated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength increased tremendously. He swept his spear and directly broke through Kuang Dao’s fist force, sending him flying.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Kuang Dao was shocked, it was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Since the start of the battle, Lu Ming had not used his full strength. This kind of combat strength was simply abnormal. He was more abnormal than any monster he had ever seen.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>After repelling Kuang Dao, Lu Ming immediately used the three apocalyptic strikes, which turned into a dazzling spear radiance and attacked Kuang Dao.</p><p>“No, no, block it, I want to block it!”</p><p>In the face of Lu Ming’s attack, Kuang Dao’s expression changed drastically. He felt the threat of death.</p><p>This attack could possibly kill him.</p><p>“Black Gold art!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared and his body gave off a black light. A layer of black metal-like light appeared on his body.</p><p>This was another kind of divine skill, a defensive divine skill.</p><p>After using the defensive divine skill, crazy Dao punched continuously. The last huge fist force was directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist force dissipated and the spear light hit Kuang Dao’s body. Kuang Dao’s body shook violently and flew out like a meteor. In an instant, he had flown thousands of miles.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>He spat out a mouthful of blood as his defensive divine skill was pierced through. The black armor on his body shattered, and a large hole appeared in his chest.</p><p>However, he did not die and blocked Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>Kuang Dao only had one thought. He used all his strength and even burned his Shen power. His entire body was like a ball of fire as he rushed into the distance. His speed was shocking. In the blink of an eye, he was tens of thousands of li away.</p><p>this guy’s life-saving ability is really strong!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head slightly. He was also a little surprised that he did not kill the Mad Daoist with one move.</p><p>However, mad Dao’s life-saving ability was indeed powerful. He used the secret skill, offensive divine skill, defensive divine skill, and the armor together to block Lu Ming’s killing blow.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not cultivate any speed-type divine skill. His speed was limited and he would not be able to catch up with Kuang Dao.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Huang Chengan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
