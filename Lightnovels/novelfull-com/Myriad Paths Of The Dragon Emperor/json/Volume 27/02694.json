It was five meters tall and ten meters long. Its body was covered in pitch-black scales. There were two dragon horns on its head, and it had a wild aura.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beasts roared and stomped their hind legs, turning into a few black streams of light that pounced toward Lu Ming and Yue Linglong.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He shook his long spear and stabbed a few times in succession.</p><p>A few spearlights pierced through the three netherdragon beasts ‘foreheads.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>The long spear struck the nether Dragon beasts ‘foreheads, producing a metallic clang and sparks flying in all directions. The three nether Dragon beasts were forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, Lu Ming also felt a huge wave of energy surging along the long spear, shaking his arm until it was slightly numb.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked. He could sense that these nether Dragon beasts were all at the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm, but they were shockingly powerful.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current abilities, there were not many virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses who could make his arm numb.</p><p>What shocked Lu Ming even more was that after the three nether Dragon beasts were forced back, they shook their heads and were completely fine.</p><p>What an amazing defense!</p><p>If it were any other ninth-level void G.o.d-level wild beast, it would definitely have a few more holes in it and die on the spot after being stabbed by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The three nether Dragon beasts roared. Then, a few more nether Dragon beasts appeared from the mountains. They were filled with killing intent as they pounced.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged over as well. He circulated his ruler’s divine power with all his might. The four divine flames in his body burned fiercely. The three types of King-grade divine power merged with the ruler’s divine power, bursting forth with astonishing power.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast howled and clawed at Lu Ming with its blade-like claws. The wind whistled and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two sides continued to clash. Lu Ming was still stronger. His long spear struck the three nether Dragon beasts, and fifteen layers of strength continued to burst forth, sending the three nether Dragon beasts flying.</p><p>However, after the nether Dragon was sent flying, it shook its head and body as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“This strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. The nether Dragon beast’s abilities had completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p>It was no wonder that the inner sect elders had said that the netherdragon beast core, the Dragon Bone flower, was very powerful and that only those who had broken through the light screens could enter.</p><p>Lu Ming concluded that even if they had the combat strength of a ninth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm, they were far from being a match for the nether Dragon beast. To kill the nether Dragon beast, at least many people had to work together.</p><p>On the other side, Yue Linglong was also fighting with a few nether Dragon beasts.</p><p>A soft whip appeared in Yue Linglong’s hand. As she waved the soft whip, the sky was filled with whip shadows, trapping the nether Dragon beasts in the middle.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s abilities had also exceeded Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Yue Linglong’s cultivation base was at ninth-tier virtual G.o.d-level, but Lu Ming felt that Yue Linglong was not weaker than many of the top talents on the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>However, Yue Linglong’s status was not ordinary. She was not an outer sect disciple, but lived directly in the inner sect.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect had many such examples. Many of the descendants of the important figures were directly trained in the inner sect and would not join the outer sect. Naturally, they would not Enter the Void G.o.d rank, but their strength was still very shocking.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast let out a furious roar as it was continuously sent flying by Lu Ming. Its murderous aura soared to the sky, and a layer of black flames covered its body. It glared at Lu Ming, then pounced at him again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>However, the nether Dragon beast’s defense was too shocking. It was. .h.i.t by Lu Ming’s attacks continuously, but it seemed to be fine. Lu Ming could not break through its defense at all.</p><p>In terms of strength, Lu Ming could easily crush the nether Dragon beasts, but he could not break through their defenses and was difficult to kill.</p><p>that’s not right. There must be a weakness somewhere. As long as we can find that weakness, we’ll be able to kill it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>If there were no flaws, then how did the people who entered 100000 or 200000 years ago kill them?</p><p>If they could not even kill Lu Ming, then there would not be many people below the true G.o.d level who could.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming began to probe.</p><p>The spear was thrust at different parts of the netherdragon beast.</p><p>Finally, after hundreds of attempts, Lu Ming finally found the nether Dragon beast’s weakness.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear pierced through the nether Dragon’s neck.</p><p>The nether Dragon roared as blood flowed out of its body. It then fell to the ground, twitched a few times, and died.</p><p>The neck was the netherdragon beast’s vital point!</p><p>“Yue Linglong, attack their necks!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Yue Linglong’s attack changed. The soft whip became hard and stabbed out like a long spear.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The soft whip pierced into the neck of one of the netherdragon beasts, killing it.</p><p>“As expected, it’s the neck!”</p><p>Yue Linglong was very excited and launched a frenzied counterattack.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also launched his attacks. He thrust his spear forward continuously. Although the nether Dragon beasts tried their best to Dodge, they could not do so and were killed by Lu Ming one by one.</p><p>On the other side, Yue Linglong had also killed the last two netherdragon beasts.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two of them then dug out a few beast cores from the nether dragon’s chest.</p><p>There were a total of six beast cores, three for each person.</p><p>This kind of beast core could be used to refine divine pills. It was very useful and could even help true G.o.ds and celestial G.o.ds. Otherwise, it would not have been so expensive.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. One beast core was equivalent to a hundred points, which was equivalent to a million divine crystals.</p><p>“Let’s go, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with pa.s.sion. He flew forward with Yue Linglong.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>They hadn’t flown very far when they heard a series of roars coming from ahead. There were at least a dozen nether Dragon beasts leaping through the mountains and running toward them.</p><p>we didn’t go looking for you, but you delivered yourself to our door. You’ve come at the right time!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and charged at the nether Dragon beasts.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast was powerful and its strength was shocking. However, since it knew its weakness, it was not too difficult for Lu Ming to deal with it given his combat strength.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yue Linglong joined forces and killed more than ten nether Dragon beasts before long. Each of them obtained seven pieces.</p><p>In addition to the three pieces from before, he had a total of ten pieces. If he exchanged them for points, he would have a thousand points.</p><p>One thousand points could be exchanged for a slightly inferior King-grade wondrous technique.</p><p>The speed at which he was earning points made Lu Ming feel extremely carefree.</p><p>Of course, they were only able to achieve this speed because they were powerful cultivators who had killed the nether Dragon. If it were anyone else, it would be impossible for them to achieve this speed.</p><p>Even if a normal ninth level ethereal G.o.d Realm outer sect disciple knew the nether Dragon beast’s weakness, they would need many people to kill it.</p><p>If he were to encounter more than ten nether Dragons at once, he would not be able to deal with them at all and could only escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
