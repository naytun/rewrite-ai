Hahaha!”</p><p>Hu Gu laughed out loud. After a few more laughs, his smile suddenly disappeared and he stared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze, during this period of time, some people have placed you on the same level as me and called you the fourth top expert in the Dongcheng Area. I’d like to see what you’re capable of!</p><p>After saying that, tiger bone stepped out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Every step he took caused the ground to rumble. Tiger bone’s body also swelled up and became extremely majestic.</p><p>A halberd was formed in his hand with divine power. It was as tall as a person.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Tiger bone roared and his aura rose higher and higher. He continued to take steps and raised his aura to the maximum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The halberd suddenly slashed down at Lu Ming with a thunderous momentum.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was also very direct. He swept his long spear out.</p><p>The long spear and the halberd met in mid-air, and a shocking boom rang out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying power burst out from tiger bone’s battle-ax, which seemed to be able to split the mountains and the earth.</p><p>This was the explosive power of an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s long spear burst out with seven layers of power at the same time. The seven layers of power overlapped and each layer was stronger than the previous.</p><p>Seven layers of power gushed out, instantly crushing the power of the Tiger bone halberd, and rushed towards the other party.</p><p>Tiger bone’s expression changed drastically. He was forced to retreat more than ten steps before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>your incomplete divine skill has already reached the third level. How is that possible? ”</p><p>Tiger bone roared in shock.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming did not use all of his power of domination. He had used an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>He had used the third stage of his incomplete divine skill to defeat his opponent in one fell swoop.</p><p>“What? The third level, how is it possible? how could he have cultivated an incomplete divine skill to the third level?”</p><p>how long has it been? I’ve only cultivated to the first stage not long ago!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Tiger bone’s words caused the other tiger-men youths to be extremely shocked.</p><p>Although the difficulty of cultivating an incomplete divine skill was not as high as a complete divine skill, it was already very difficult for people at their level.</p><p>Out of the one million people, a portion of them had not even reached the beginner level. They had not even cultivated to the first level.</p><p>A large portion of them, even though they had learned the rudiments, were only at the first level.</p><p>For example, tiger bone had cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the second level. With his King-grade divine power, he had become one of the top three experts in the Dongcheng Area.</p><p>At this moment, the heaven’s favorites who were hiding in the surrounding buildings were also scared out of their wits. Their eyes were wide open.</p><p>It was a complete ma.s.sacre, a one-sided ma.s.sacre.</p><p>At first, many people wanted to wait for Lu Ming and the Tigermen race to suffer heavy losses so that they could take advantage of the situation. However, they were now filled with fear.</p><p>Pick up a bargain?</p><p>Lu Ming did not consume much energy.</p><p>They did not even dare to breathe loudly. They held their breaths for fear of being discovered by Lu Ming.</p><p>“So many points …”</p><p>At this moment, the badge on his chest was sending out a series of notifications.</p><p>His points had skyrocketed, and his ranking had also risen.</p><p>Now, his ranking had directly rushed up to the 51st place in the 20th region.</p><p>“I’ve finally returned to the top 100!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Wanling city, the people of the chaotic astral River were also shocked.</p><p>“Look, Lu Ming’s ranking is soaring!”</p><p>“So fast, 137,129,98,67 …”</p><p>They gasped when they saw Lu Ming’s ranking rising.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s ranking was set at 51st place.</p><p>51st place. That’s amazing. I never expected that Lu Ming would actually charge into the 51st place in the twentieth region. As long as he maintains this ranking, he will definitely enter the top 100!</p><p>that’s right. I didn’t expect so many geniuses to appear in the righteous heavenly Army this time!</p><p>“This is too shocking!”</p><p>There was a lot of discussion around. The leaders of these forces looked at the ancestor of technique with envy.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan’s faces were as ugly as they could be.</p><p>……</p><p>The 20th region!</p><p>Lu Ming was about to leave when he suddenly looked to his left.</p><p>There was a black-robed young man with a pair of wings on his back.</p><p>This was a winged man.</p><p>The wings on his back flapped and he floated in the air, floating toward Lu Ming.</p><p>One should know that one couldn’t fly in this place, but this person was floating in the air with his wings.</p><p>“It’s Deng Yu!
