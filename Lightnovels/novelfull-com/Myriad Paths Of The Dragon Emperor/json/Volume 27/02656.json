This time, Lu Ming had used an incomplete divine skill. Moreover, he had unleashed the power of the fourth level, which was nine levels of strength. It surged out and collided with Huang Wu’s palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion. Lu Ming retreated rapidly, his steps causing the ground to explode.</p><p>As for Huang Wu, he also retreated!</p><p>This attack was evenly matched.</p><p>“This kid is so strong!”</p><p>It was still alright for the new disciples as they knew Lu Ming’s strength. The senior disciples around them were all shocked that Lu Ming could block Huang Wu’s attack and even push him back.</p><p>This level of strength could be said to be shocking.</p><p>Most importantly, they were even more shocked when they realized that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at demiG.o.d-level after scanning with their spiritual senses.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Huang Wu’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Earlier on, he saw that Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at demiG.o.d-level, so he did not use his full strength in the attack just now. However, with his cultivation base, even if he did not use his full strength, he could easily suppress an ordinary fourth-tier virtual G.o.d existence. Yet, he was repelled by Lu Ming with one move.</p><p>kid, you have some strength, but I was far from using my full strength just now. Now, I’ll let you see what a senior brother is and what a rookie is!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! Huang Wu coldly said, his divine power surging out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He charged at Lu Ming and struck out with his palm again.</p><p>A blade of light shot out from his palm and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Huang Wu had used almost all of his strength in this move, and he had also used an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>He had cultivated for many years and had already cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the fifth level. Its power was astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>To be honest, Huang Wu’s strength was shocking. The divine power he controlled was King-grade divine power, and he had cultivated an incomplete divine skill. He was far from being comparable to those fifth level void G.o.d Realm cultivators from the righteous Army and origin Luo Palace.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming activated the ‘battle formula’ that doubled his combat strength. In an instant, Lu Ming’s combat strength increased greatly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear once again collided with the Huang Wu. This time, the vibration was greater and stronger.</p><p>Their bodies trembled violently again, and they were forced to retreat.</p><p>“What? He blocked it again!”</p><p>this time, Huang Wu used all his strength, but he was actually blocked. Is that kid still human? ”</p><p>this is a demiG.o.d! Are you kidding me? ”</p><p>The senior disciples who were watching in secret were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even the new disciples who had seen Lu Ming in action during the a.s.sessment widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>During the a.s.sessment, Lu Ming was not that powerful.</p><p>This was only natural. During the a.s.sessment, Lu Ming could not use the battle formula. Now that he could use it, it was naturally powerful.</p><p>“This kid, how is this possible? I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared in his heart. His eyes were incomparably ferocious as he charged at Lu Ming again. His palm was like a blade, and the blade Qi was unceasingly slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming used his divine power to form a long spear. He was not afraid at all as he charged towards Huang Wu.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming exerted the incomplete divine skill to its maximum, urging it to the sixth level to fight against Huang Wu. The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in an instant, and Lu Ming began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>“Monster, what kind of monster is this?”</p><p>The senior disciples almost bit off their tongues.</p><p>A demiG.o.d was actually able to suppress Huang Wu, who was at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm. Moreover, Huang Wu was not an ordinary fifth level void G.o.d Realm expert. He was a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>The two young men who followed Huang Wu couldn’t do anything at all. Their cultivation base was even lower than Huang Wu’s.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to cripple you!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; a battle saber appeared in his hand. This battle saber was a low-quality level six divine artifact.</p><p>With the divine weapon in hand, his strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only one who has a divine artifact?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A long spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained this long spear from the deity’s cave abode. It was a level nine low-grade divine artifact.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled as he performed the incomplete divine skill. In an instant, thirteen layers of power burst out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Huang Wu’s body shook violently, and he was forced to retreat. The arm that was holding the saber was in great pain, and it was almost split open.</p><p>“A level nine low grade G.o.d artifact!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared, his eyes burning as he stared at the long spear in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>&Nbsp; a level nine low quality G.o.d artifact would at least cost a hundred thousand G.o.d crystals on the market.</p><p>Lu Ming, a demiG.o.d, actually had a level nine low-grade divine artifact.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the divine artifact and I’ll let this matter rest!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared.</p><p>“Idiot, you want to just let it go like that, but I don’t want to!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He used the ROC wings technique and in a flash, he attacked Huang Wu.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Huang Wu was furious and could only try his best to resist.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a level nine low-grade divine artifact. His combat power was undoubtedly stronger and he completely suppressed Huang Wu. After a few moves, the saber in Huang Wu’s hand flew out. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and retreated quickly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his spear across and whipped Huang Wu’s body. Huang Wu fell to the ground and vomited a large mouthful of blood. His face was filled with shock and anger.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to hurt me? I’ll make sure you die a horrible death!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and Huang Wu was swept away like a cannonball. He turned into a black dot and could no longer be seen.</p><p>After sending Huang Wu flying, Lu Ming took a deep breath and kept Huang Wu’s saber.</p><p>The value of a level six low-grade divine artifact wasn’t low either. It could be exchanged for quite a few divine artifact fragments for QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>As QiuQiu’s level increased, this fellow’s appet.i.te also became stronger. This fellow even despised low-level divine artifact fragments and insisted on eating divine artifact fragments that were of a higher level than itself.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you injure Huang Wu? do you know who he is? You’re dead for sure, you know that?”</p><p>One of the young men who came with Huang Wu shouted.</p><p>“Get lost. If you don’t, I’ll beat you up as well!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept across the two young men.</p><p>The two young men shivered, revealing a look of fear. They didn’t dare to say anything more and left dejectedly.</p><p>“This newbie is really crazy!”</p><p>a demiG.o.d with such terrifying combat strength must be a peerless genius. However, Huang Wu’s background isn’t simple. His elder brother is a top figure among the inner disciples, and he’s from the Holy son’s faction. I’m afraid this newcomer won’t have a good time in the future!</p><p>that’s right. Unless he also has a backer, he’s finished!</p><p>Some of the senior disciples were discussing.</p><p>Some of the new disciples were stunned as well. They did not expect Lu Ming to be so domineering that he even dared to beat up the senior disciples.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. Then, they went to find a courtyard to stay in without a word. They did not dare to get too close to Lu Ming for fear of being implicated.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you!”</p><p>At this moment, Deng Yu walked over and cupped his fists.</p><p>“What are you thanking me for? I just don’t want to give you the G.o.d crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>brother Lu, you have to be careful. Those few people dared to extort new disciples in public. I’m afraid they have a strong background. I’m afraid they will take revenge later!</p><p>Deng Yu reminded.</p><p>“We’ll deal with whatever comes our way, and we’ll deal with whatever comes our way!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>What hadn’t he experienced on his journey? What kind of risk had he not encountered? His mind was already extremely firm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
