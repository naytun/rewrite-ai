At the same time, there was also a deep sense of greed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted and displayed the sword-breaking art. The sword light was bright and thick like pillars as it charged towards Kang Ji and the others.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Kang Ji and the others also made their moves. Four terrifying attacks were aimed at the ancestor of technique.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A violent explosion sounded. The ancestor of technique’s body retreated a few steps, but the attacks of Kang Ji and the others were all blocked by the ancestor of technique.</p><p>He was only at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>“It really is a level Seven middle grade G.o.d artifact!”</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, how could that brat have a level Seven middle grade divine artifact?”</p><p>this kid must have had some fortuitous encounter!</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others shouted.</p><p>However, they did not suspect that Lu Ming had obtained the divine weapon from the cave abode.</p><p>This was because the door to the cave abode was too difficult to break open. Even with so many people, they would need to spend a lot of time to break it.</p><p>How could Lu Ming break it?</p><p>Moreover, they had searched the cave and found no other entrance.</p><p>They only thought that Lu Ming had a fortuitous encounter from somewhere else.</p><p>“Lu Ming, follow me closely!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed closely behind the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Let’s see which one of you can stop me!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s long hair flew in the air, and his sword Qi was wild as it rushed towards Kang Ji’s direction.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared and charged towards the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Situ haonan and the others also launched their attacks.</p><p>However, the ancestor of technique was controlling a middle-grade level Seven divine artifact, and his battle prowess increased by a level. He was no longer afraid of Kang Ji and the other three joining forces.</p><p>Both sides continued to attack and exchanged dozens of moves in an instant. However, the ancestor of technique was only at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the ancestor of technique defeated Kang Ji and brought Lu Ming out of the tight encirclement.</p><p>“I won’t accompany you today. If you want to fight, we’ll fight another day!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique carried Lu Ming and flew into the distance. His voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared endlessly, his face was filled with a sinister expression.</p><p>Today was such a good opportunity, but the ancestor of technique had actually escaped.</p><p>Furthermore, the ancestor of technique had also obtained a middle-grade level Seven divine artifact, which greatly increased his battle prowess. This was extremely disadvantageous to them.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Situ haonan’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>They did not pursue.</p><p>They knew that even if they caught up, they would not be able to kill the ancestor of technique. If the ancestor of technique went all out, even if they could kill him, at least two of them would die.</p><p>None of them wanted to die!</p><p>Alliance, we must form an alliance, a real Alliance. Otherwise, we will be broken by the ancestor of technique one by one!</p><p>Kang Ji gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Situ haonan immediately nodded.</p><p>In the current situation, none of them were the ancestor of technique’s match. They had to truly join forces and support each other if there was a situation. Only then could they fight against the ancestor of technique.</p><p>also, we have to break through this cave as soon as possible. As long as we get the treasures inside, we won’t have to fear the ancestor of technique!</p><p>Kang Ji said.</p><p>“That’s right, attack immediately!”</p><p>Situ haonan said. Then, they immediately returned to the cave dwelling, planning to take a risk and try to enter the hurricane pa.s.sage.</p><p>The ancestor of technique brought Lu Ming and flew tens of thousands of miles away in the blink of an eye before he stopped.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The ancestor of technique spat out a mouthful of blood and his face became paler.</p><p>“Senior, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried.</p><p>“It’s okay, I’ll be fine after regulating my breath. Kang Ji and the others probably won’t dare to chase after us. Let’s rest again!”</p><p>After saying that, the ancestor of technique took out a healing elixir and swallowed it. Then, he started to heal himself.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s injuries weren’t very serious. Not long after, his complexion became much better.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s all thanks to you this time. I’ll return this divine weapon to you!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique smiled. He took out the level Seven middle-grade divine artifact and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior, you can keep this divine artifact for now!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled but did not take it.</p><p>how can this be? a middle-grade level Seven G.o.d artifact is too valuable. How can I accept it? ”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shook his head.</p><p>Even he, Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others didn’t have a level Seven middle grade G.o.d artifact. The ones they used before were all level four middle grade G.o.d artifacts.</p><p>“Senior, just take it as I’m lending it to you first. I can’t use this divine artifact even if I keep it. Only you can use it to fight against Kang Ji and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Right now, the yuanluo Palace and the Walkabout sect had joined forces, and the righteous Army was all alone. Without a middle grade level Seven divine artifact, the ancestor of technique might not be a match for the other party. Only with this divine artifact could he contend with the other party and make them fear him.</p><p>alright, I’ll keep it for now. I’ll return it to you when your cultivation improves!</p><p>The ancestor of technique muttered to himself and did not decline.</p><p>He also understood that Lu Ming was right.</p><p>If he didn’t have a level Seven middle grade G.o.d artifact, if Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others joined forces to deal with him, he would really be no match.</p><p>Putting away the combat sword, the ancestor of technique brought Lu Ming and met up with the rest of the righteous Army.</p><p>“Ancestor of technique, how’s the situation?”</p><p>should we kill our way over? we can’t let the yuanluo Palace occupy that expert’s cave!</p><p>The people of the righteous Army said one by one.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. How is it possible for the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect to occupy this cave? Let’s go back to the righteous Army and spread the news that there’s an expert’s cave here!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“General is wise. Since we can’t have it, they can’t have it all to themselves!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>hahahaha! the righteous Army laughed. Then, they returned to Seven Star Island and used the teleportation formation to return to the righteous Army.</p><p>Then, they started to spread the news.</p><p>Very quickly, the news of a deity’s cave dwelling on the northern Shang star spread like a hurricane through the chaotic astral River, reaching the ears of every single power.</p><p>“What? It’s actually a deity’s cave abode!”</p><p>“It’s extremely rare in the chaotic astral River. I can’t miss it!”</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to make a trip there myself!”</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, all the powers, big and small, were alarmed.</p><p>One expert after another hurried to Northern Shang.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, divine realm experts are Supreme existences. Their divine might can shake the endless starry sky.</p><p>Currently, in the chaotic astral River, only the Yunfeng Pavilion has a single heavenly deity.</p><p>The deity’s cave dwelling was too attractive to the true G.o.d Realm experts of the big and small forces.</p><p>Not long after, experts arrived at the Chen Jin mine on planet Northern Shang.</p><p>All of them were true G.o.d stage existences. Moreover, the majority of them were powerhouses above the fourth stage true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n fa Ming, d.a.m.n Righteous Army!”</p><p>Kang Ji roared again and again. He was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>With so many experts here, how could they have a share? they could only follow the crowd. Even if there were treasures inside, they might not even get a share.</p><p>Any force here would not be weaker than the yuan Luo Palace.</p><p>Kang Ji really wanted to vomit blood. After he discovered this deity’s cave dwelling, he didn’t even get a single hair.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
