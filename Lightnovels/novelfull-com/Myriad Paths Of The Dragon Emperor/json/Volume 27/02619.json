The training conditions and environment are simply not something the chaotic astral river can compare with.</p><p>Furthermore, if he were to be taken in as a disciple by a heavenly deity or even a G.o.dking, his future would truly be boundless.</p><p>that’s why I’ve summoned all of you here this time to let you partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven star region’s disciple recruitment event. However, it’s not that easy to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans. You’ll have to go through layers of screening and it’s extremely difficult!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said. His eyes were also filled with antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>As long as someone in the righteous Army joined the Qin heavenly thirteen clans and became a disciple of the clan, the righteous Army’s status in the chaotic astral River would rise. At that time, countless powers would come to curry favor with them.</p><p>At that time, it would be a piece of cake for the Walkabout sect to destroy the yuan Luo Palace.</p><p>“We will definitely do our best to join the Qin heavenly thirteen clans!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er and the others shouted, their eyes firm.</p><p>They understood that this was a great opportunity for them and they had to grasp it.</p><p>alright, go back and make your preparations. We’ll meet here in ten days. I’ll bring you to Cloud Peak City first. The first batch of screening will be carried out there!</p><p>“By the way, Lu Ming, you stay behind!”</p><p>After the ancestor of technique finished speaking, he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er and the rest left, leaving Lu Ming behind.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little puzzled. He did not know why the ancestor of technique had asked him to stay.</p><p>“Lu Ming, when the Qin Tian thirteen clans recruit disciples, they only look at talent and not cultivation. Therefore, with your talent, you’ll definitely be chosen by the Qin Tian thirteen clans!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>Lu Ming had mastered the path of domination. He would definitely be noticed with such talent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, which sect or force do you want to join?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique asked.</p><p>I haven’t thought about it yet. I don’t know much about the Qin heaven thirteen clans. I’ll see how it goes!</p><p>I haven’t thought about it yet. I don’t know much about the Qin heaven thirteen clans. I’ll see how it goes!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a request …”</p><p>The ancestor of technique muttered to himself for a moment before sighing.</p><p>“Senior, if you have something to say, please speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I would like to invite you to join a sect!”</p><p>After the ancestor of technique finished speaking, he paused for a moment and continued, ” among the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the strongest are the three Overlord forces: the Yimo Academy, the imperishable sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>however, the sect I want you to join is not one of the three overlords, but one of the top ten sects, the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>“Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts.</p><p>you must be wondering why I let you join the three Overlord forces. Sigh, I have my own selfish motives here. Back then, I had some dealings with the Kong Xuan sect …</p><p>At this point, the ancestor of technique told him about what had happened between him and the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>It turned out that after the ancestor of technique escaped from the yuanluo Palace, he had been travelling and tempering himself in the vast universe. He had once left the chaotic astral River and headed to other vast galaxies.</p><p>In the process, he met a woman and fell in love with her.</p><p>However, this woman was a proud daughter of the sky Mystic sect, and her father was an important figure in the sky Mystic sect.</p><p>Such a status was much, much higher than the ancestor of technique’s.</p><p>Naturally, the woman’s father was strongly against their relationship and had forcefully brought the woman back to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>He had once said that the ancestor of technique would not let the two meet as long as he could not break through to the heavenly G.o.d Realm.</p><p>sigh, with my talent, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult for me to reach the sky celestial realm in this lifetime. So, I have some selfish motives and want you to join the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>At this point, the ancestor of technique took out an exquisite dagger and said, ” if you join the Kong Xuan sect, return this dagger to her if you have the chance. Oh right, her name is Yuexin. Return it to her and tell her that I’ve let her down …</p><p>however, this is my own selfish desire. If you don’t want to join the Kong Xuan sect, I won’t force you …</p><p>The ancestor of technique sighed. His eyes were filled with nostalgia and helplessness.</p><p>“Senior, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took the dagger from the ancestor of technique’s hands.</p><p>The matter with the ancestor of technique reminded him of the matter between him and Xie nianqing.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, he and Xie nianqing had also gone through many trials before they got together. It was actually somewhat similar to the matter with the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not really care which sect or force he joined.</p><p>He had Jing Yu’s legacy, but he had yet to break the seal on Jing Yu’s portrait.</p><p>Once the seal was broken, Lu Ming believed that he would definitely gain something. Moreover, he still had the battle character formula to comprehend.</p><p>The main reason he joined the sect was to obtain resources.</p><p>All sorts of resources that would be helpful to his cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, there was another reason. Although the Kong Xuan sect was one of the top ten sects, it was ranked first.</p><p>In this aspect, he was not much worse than the three overlords.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique cupped his fists solemnly.</p><p>“Senior, your words are too serious!”</p><p>“Senior, I have some friends. Can they partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven thirteen clans ‘disciple recruitment meet?” Lu Ming hurriedly helped the ancestor of technique up.</p><p>He thought of Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and dandan.</p><p>of course you can. Anyone who hasn’t cultivated for ten thousand years can partic.i.p.ate. I remember that your wife’s talent is extremely shocking. I originally wanted to ask you to ask her to come along!</p><p>however, you need to be at least at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm to partic.i.p.ate in the selection. However, your combat strength is extremely strong, so you don’t need to meet this condition!</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“Do I need to be at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Initially, he wanted to call bubbles, his disciples, Lu Xiangxiang, Ouyang Moli, and the others. However, it seemed like only Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and dandan fit the criteria.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to the ancestor of technique and returned to his residence.</p><p>After he returned to his residence, Lu Ming looked for Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun and told them about the recruitment of disciples for the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>Dandan immediately raised her hands in agreement. Xie nianqing, she would naturally go wherever Lu Ming went.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>Xie nianjun agreed without hesitation.</p><p>To Xie nianjun, she didn’t care about heavenly G.o.ds or divine kings.</p><p>She didn’t care about divine skills or divine techniques.</p><p>What she cared about was the cultivation resources in the powerful forces and the excellent cultivation environment. That way, her strength would skyrocket.</p><p>During this period of time, all the major and minor powers in the chaotic astral River had become excited. They had gathered all the experts of the younger generation who met the requirements and were preparing to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven thirteen clans ‘selection of disciples.</p><p>In a large hall in the yuanluo Palace, eight young men stood in a row.</p><p>Kang long was there, and at the head of the table was the yuanluo Palace Master, Kang Ji.</p><p>“This time, all of you must do your best. At least, at least one of you must join the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, even if it’s the weakest clan among the thirteen clans. That way, the yuan Luo Palace’s prestige in the chaotic astral River will increase greatly. At that time, we won’t even have to fear the Yunfeng Pavilion. Do you understand?”</p><p>Kang Ji said loudly.</p><p>“Understood. We will do our best!”</p><p>Kang long and the rest shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
