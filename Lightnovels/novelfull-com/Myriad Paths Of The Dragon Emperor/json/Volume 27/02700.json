He had to rush out first.</p><p>“Ling Long, he’s right. Let’s rush out first. He might be able to escape …”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said to Yue Linglong.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you must rush out!”</p><p>Yue Linglong gritted her teeth and rushed in the other direction with Wu Zifeng. As expected, the nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower did not care about them at all. They rushed through the canyon easily and came to a mountain peak outside the canyon. They looked into the distance and waited for Lu Ming.</p><p>This wait lasted for more than ten minutes.</p><p>“Why isn’t he out yet?”</p><p>Yue Linglong was a little anxious.</p><p>“He’s out!”</p><p>Suddenly, Wu Zifeng’s eyes moved.</p><p>From the canyon in the distance, a figure was rushing over at top speed. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s entire body was bathed in blood. His entire body was almost covered by the dark Dragon blood Curse. As soon as he rushed out of the canyon, he turned into a rainbow light and rushed into the distance at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower chased after him like a tide, but they were slower than Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s follow them!”</p><p>Yue Linglong and the other woman followed from another direction.</p><p>The nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower were not as fast as Lu Ming and they soon lost track of him. They slowly came to a stop and retreated.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng flew all the way and finally found Lu Ming after some time.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was lying in a small stream, unconscious.</p><p>The dark Dragon blood Curse slithered around his body like small snakes. It slowly hid and disappeared.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng brought Lu Ming to a cave and waited patiently.</p><p>“This is a disciple of your Kong Xuan sect? His strength is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng sized Lu Ming up and said.</p><p>it’s indeed shocking. Moreover, he has just entered the sect not long ago!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Just entered the sect?”</p><p>Wu Zifeng’s eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they waited.</p><p>Lu Ming finally woke up a few hours later.</p><p>It hurt!</p><p>After Lu Ming woke up, the first thing he felt was intense pain all over his body.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took out a few healing pills to consume. He began to refine the medicinal effects to recover.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming had finally adjusted his condition to the peak. The injuries on his body had also healed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you alright?”</p><p>Yue Linglong walked over.</p><p>“I’m fine. Thank you for your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He had been unconscious outside earlier. If it were not for Yue Linglong and the rest, he would have been in grave danger. He might have been killed by the nether Dragon beast’s fangs.</p><p>“I should be the one thanking you!”</p><p>Yue Linglong quickly said.</p><p>that’s right. We should be the ones thanking you. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to break out of the encirclement of the nether Dragon beast and the Dragonbone flower!</p><p>Wu Zifeng quickly stepped forward and held Yue Linglong’s hand. He looked at Lu Ming warily.</p><p>Yue Linglong’s little face blushed slightly, and she said, ” “Lu Ming, let me introduce you. This is … My fiancé, Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It turned out that Wu Zifeng was Yue Linglong’s fiancé. No wonder he risked his life to save her. No wonder he was wary of him.</p><p>However, Wu Zifeng’s character should be considered good. If other people saw his fiancée with other people, they would probably reveal killing intent.</p><p>Moreover, he could see that Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong’s relationship was not bad.</p><p>Of course, he would not be so narcissistic as to think that the reason why Yue Linglong approached him in the past was because she was interested in him. It was mostly out of curiosity.</p><p>“Brother woo, you’re too polite. I’m only letting you go first because I’m confident in my chances.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>by the way, brother Lu, what’s with the curse mark on your body? ”</p><p>Wu Zifeng changed the topic.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Wu Zifeng was asking about the dark Dragon blood Curse.</p><p>However, the dark Dragon blood Curse was placed by the sect master of Kong Xuan sect. It was of great importance, and Lu Ming could not reveal it. Otherwise, the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>I found this by accident when I was exploring an ancient ruin. Nothing has happened to it. I wonder why it’s acting up today!</p><p>Lu Ming casually told a lie.</p><p>I see. Brother Lu, I feel that this curse is extremely evil. If it’s used for too long, I’m afraid it’ll be disadvantageous to you. We need to find a way to get rid of it!</p><p>Wu Zifu said with a sincere expression. He didn’t seem to be putting on an act.</p><p>“Many thanks for brother Wu’s reminder!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a feeling that those netherdragon beasts and Dragon Bone flowers are after your curse mark. We’ll have to be more careful when we move in the future to avoid being surrounded!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>it’s a pity that we’re still too weak. Otherwise, we could have killed a large number of nether Dragons and obtained points!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, why didn’t I think of that!”</p><p>Oh? ” Yue Linglong’s eyes brightened. my cultivation base has long reached the peak of the void G.o.d Realm. I didn’t break through before because I wanted to enter the dark Dragon secret realm!</p><p>however, after entering this place, I can make a breakthrough. I can break through to the true G.o.d Realm now, and when I do, it will be much easier to kill the nether Dragon!</p><p>that’s right. I can also charge into the true G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Wu Zifeng also nodded and said.</p><p>alright, then we’ll cultivate here for a while. After we break through, we’ll go hunt the nether Dragon!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>alright, we’ll work together. We’ll split the beast cores and dragon bones equally!</p><p>Yue Linglong said. The three of them discussed and began to cultivate.</p><p>Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng began to break through to the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming began to cultivate in another direction.</p><p>His cultivation had just broken through to the 5th level void G.o.d Realm, so it was impossible for him to break through in a short period of time.</p><p>The only way he could increase his strength was through the G.o.dly skills and the battle formula.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that after the previous battle, not only did he have a breakthrough in the nine stage Crimson Gold armor, but he had also made great progress in the three apocalyptic strikes and the battle character formula.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he had to activate the battle character formula eight times to trigger the tripled combat power.</p><p>The probability had increased to one-eighth.</p><p>As for the《three apocalyptic strikes》, it wasn’t far from breaking through to the second stage, and it seemed like it could break through at any time.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming focused his energy on the ” three apocalyptic strikes “.</p><p>As expected, half a month later, the《three apocalyptic strikes》successfully broke through and reached the second stage.</p><p>Now that the《three apocalyptic strikes》had reached the second stage, its attack power had undoubtedly increased by a large amount.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation, in addition to the second stage of the three apocalyptic strikes and the ninefold Crimson Gold armor, in addition to triggering the tripled combat strength, Lu Ming’s abilities would reach an astonishing level.</p><p>If he met mad Dao again, he could crush him into dust with one move.</p><p>At this time, the aura on Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng’s bodies became stronger and stronger.</p><p>Time flew by, and another half a month pa.s.sed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A shocking aura burst out from Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng at the same time.</p><p>The two of them broke through almost at the same time and reached the true G.o.d Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
