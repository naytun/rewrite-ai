Before it even reached him, Lu Ming’s heart was beating rapidly, and the hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>It was dangerous, extremely dangerous.</p><p>This was definitely an extremely terrifying existence that had made a move. His strength far exceeded that of a 6th level void G.o.d Realm. In fact, it was not just a 7th level void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>A terrifying person had his eyes on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming could only think about it for a year. It was too late to defend.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu appeared on Lu Ming’s left side. It transformed into a shield and blocked his way.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>That Saber Light slashed onto QiuQiu’s body and directly pierced through the shield that QiuQiu had transformed into.</p><p>However, QiuQiu had already absorbed most of the saber light’s power. The remaining power was very limited and its speed had been greatly reduced. Lu Ming finally reacted and swept his meteor spear, sweeping it across the saber Light and blocking it.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart tightened. QiuQiu had been pierced through. Would it be alright?</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>QiuQiu’s body turned into a ball again. It jumped and returned to Lu Ming’s shoulder as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“This fellow is really awesome …”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He then sped up and rushed toward the people of the righteous Army.</p><p>“There’s actually such a treasure …”</p><p>Not far away, a silver-haired old man was staring at QiuQiu with a burning gaze.</p><p>The silver-haired old man held a silver saber in his hand. He was the one who had slashed out with the saber just now.</p><p>He moved his body and charged at Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already met up with the people from the righteous Army.</p><p>Close to 300 people gathered together, like a sharp knife, they charged out with all their strength.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>More than a thousand people from the yuanluo Palace surrounded Lu Ming and his group, launching attacks at them.</p><p>Lu Ming was also in the crowd. He waved his long spear and blocked the attacks from all directions.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The silver-haired elder had his eyes on Lu Ming. He kept slashing his silver saber at Lu Ming.</p><p>Fortunately, QiuQiu transformed into a shield and protected Lu Ming’s vital points. It blocked the other party’s attack. Otherwise, Lu Ming would most likely be in danger.</p><p>Charge! Charge! Charge!</p><p>The people of the righteous Army charged forward with all their might, and some of them had even burned their divine power.</p><p>Although the righteous Army kept dying in battle, it was effective. After a while, they finally broke out of the encirclement and flew toward the vast ocean.</p><p>“Don’t chase, that matter is more important!”</p><p>A ninth-level void G.o.d Realm expert stopped the others and came to the center of the chenjin mine.</p><p>it should be here. Everyone, gather your strength and break open this mine vein!</p><p>A ninth-level void G.o.d Realm expert ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Thousands of people from the yuanluo Palace gathered and attacked at the same time. One after another, they attacked the chenjin ore vein.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The old gold mine rumbled and shattered rocks flew everywhere.</p><p>However, the people from the yuanluo Palace didn’t even look at it. Their goal didn’t seem to be the chenjin mine.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group flew at high speed. After flying for more than 100000 miles, they slowed down when they realized that the people from the origin Luo Palace were not chasing after them.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Many people roared.</p><p>This time, the losses were too great.</p><p>Out of the original 400, only about 200 were left. It was a huge loss.</p><p>This time, they didn’t expect that the origin Luo Palace would suddenly gather such a strong force to attack the old gold mine.</p><p>send the news to the seven Star Island. We must take revenge for this!</p><p>Someone gritted his teeth and then sent the news to the seven Star Island.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a pillar of light shot up into the sky from afar, piercing through the clouds.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Everyone looked in that direction in shock. That direction was clearly the direction of the chenjin mine.</p><p>“It’s at the chenjin mine. What’s going on?”</p><p>Some people were extremely puzzled.</p><p>such a shocking phenomenon. We can clearly see it from a hundred thousand miles away. There must be a rare treasure, a cave abode of a powerhouse, or some historical site!</p><p>Someone made a guess.</p><p>“It must be so. I understand now. The origin Luo Palace must have gotten some information. Their original purpose was to get the Chen gold mine. The previous attack on Seven Star Island was just an illusion!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved. Perhaps, it was true!</p><p>The attack on Seven Star Island by the yuanluo Palace might have been an illusion to confuse them. Not only could they restrain the forces on Seven Star Island, but they could also lure away some experts from the Chen gold mine. Then, the yuanluo Palace could concentrate their forces and occupy the Chen gold mine in one fell swoop.</p><p>“This won’t do. Quickly report this matter to the higher-ups, report it to the general!”</p><p>Someone immediately used a voice transmission jade talisman to send out the news.</p><p>Then, they decided to send people to the chenjin mine to check out the news.</p><p>At this moment, the chenjin mine had completely changed.</p><p>The mine vein disappeared, and a hole was revealed under it. A beam of light shot out of the hole and soared into the sky. It only disappeared after half an hour.</p><p>a deity’s cave abode, hahaha, there really is a deity’s cave abode. Quick, send the news to the hall Master!</p><p>One of the burly men laughed madly.</p><p>The others were also full of smiles, their eyes shining with a fiery light.</p><p>A deity’s cave abode, this was a cave abode left behind by a deity. It was simply unimaginable.</p><p>The chaotic astral River is vast and boundless. There are countless cultivators and countless divine spirits who have reached the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, there were only a handful of people in history who could cultivate to the heavenly-G.o.d level.</p><p>Currently, the divine realm expert known to the public was the master of the Yunfeng Pavilion, the most powerful force in the chaotic astral River.</p><p>He was the only known heavenly G.o.d in the chaotic astral River.</p><p>One could only imagine how valuable a cave abode left behind by a heavenly G.o.d was.</p><p>Even if the G.o.d of heaven had left some useless things in the cave, they were all Supreme treasures to others.</p><p>The people of the yuanluo Palace immediately spread the news. Not only did they inform the palace Master, but they also gathered more experts of the palace.</p><p>Not long after, groups of experts flew over from the sky. They were all experts from the yuanluo Palace. They had gathered here to increase the strength of this place.</p><p>A hundred thousand miles away, there was a group of people from the righteous Army who had gathered with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>They had sent out information about the other party’s location.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Someone from the righteous Army asked.</p><p>“The Chen Jin mine was ambushed by the origin Luo Palace. They sent out more than a thousand hollow G.o.d Realm cultivators, and more than two hundred of us were killed. Only these few managed to escape!”</p><p>Someone explained helplessly.</p><p>“d.a.m.n the yuanluo Palace!”</p><p>Someone from the righteous Army who came later roared.</p><p>“Why did the yuanluo Palace attack the chenjin mine?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>there should be some rare treasures on Chen Jin Island …</p><p>As soon as one of them explained, a few figures flew over from the distance. They were the few people who had been sent to observe the chenjin mine.</p><p>“A cave has appeared in the chenjin mine, and a large number of experts from the yuanluo Palace have gathered there!”</p><p>One of the people who went to inquire about the news said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
