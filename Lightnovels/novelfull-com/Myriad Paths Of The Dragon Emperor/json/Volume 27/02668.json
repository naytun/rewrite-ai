At the same time, a message emerged from Jing Yu’s portrait.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p><p>The information that emerged from Jing Yu’s portrait was a Divine Art and two divine skills.</p><p>[ universe thousand Dao Scripture ], [ three apocalyptic strikes ], [ nine stage Crimson Gold armor ].</p><p>The heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture was a divine technique, the three apocalyptic strikes was an offensive divine technique, and the nine layer Crimson Gold armor was a defensive divine technique.</p><p>Other than that, there was no other information.</p><p>Lu Ming had sworn on his life force origin that he would do something for Jing Yu, but he had not revealed any information.</p><p>could it be that my cultivation is not high enough, so I didn’t reveal any information to prevent myself from dying in vain? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had to make such a guess.</p><p>However, he didn’t have time to think about it now. He had to search for wood crystals first.</p><p>“Let’s collect the wood crystals first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Immediately, they quickly collected wood crystals at the bottom of the abyss.</p><p>There were so many blood-red ancient trees in the abyss. Obviously, many plant life forms had died under the blood-red ancient trees, leaving only wood crystals, branches, and leaves.</p><p>The few of them gathered along the side of the abyss. After walking for a few dozen miles, they came to the end of the abyss and saw a huge cave with blood-colored mist constantly spreading out.</p><p>It was obvious that some of the blood-colored ancient trees were hiding in the cave and did not dare to come out.</p><p>it seems that these ancient blood-colored trees are really afraid!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>Then, they went back to the other side of the abyss. After a few dozen miles, they reached the end of the abyss. There was a huge cave here, and the blood-red ancient trees didn’t dare to come out.</p><p>“What a great harvest!”</p><p>At the thought of the wood crystals he had collected this time, Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles.</p><p>They had collected a few hundred wood crystals of high quality. It was definitely a big harvest.</p><p>If they could refine all of them, their cultivation would definitely be greatly improved.</p><p>those people are probably waiting up there. Why don’t we refine the wood crystal here first, and then kill our way out!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He also wanted to take a good look at the divine skills and techniques he had just obtained.</p><p>Immediately, the three of them sat down cross-legged in the middle of the abyss. At this position, if the blood-colored ancient trees were to launch a sneak attack, they would be able to discover them in time and have time to respond.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun each took out a wood crystal and swallowed it.</p><p>QiuQiu, help us observe the surrounding situation!</p><p>Lu Ming was not in a hurry to refine the wood crystal. He let QiuQiu protect them first and then looked at the newly acquired divine techniques and skills in detail.</p><p>First, Lu Ming looked at the universe thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>Lu Ming focused his mind and the universe thousand Dao Scripture became clear in his mind. Lines of words and even pictures appeared in his mind.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming finished reading the universe thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked by the universe thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>The heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture was a mystical technique that specialized in cultivating divine power. Its level of abstrusity had exceeded Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>If one cultivated this wondrous technique to its peak, one could directly cultivate ruler divine power, but this was only the foundation.</p><p>&Nbsp; after cultivating a ruler’s divine power, one could cultivate other techniques, and the divine power cultivated from other techniques could coexist with a ruler’s divine power.</p><p>&Nbsp; the most shocking thing was that other divine techniques did not need to be cultivated to their peak. As long as they could cultivate a wisp of divine power, they did not need to continue cultivating, because that divine power would increase with the increase in ruler divine power.</p><p>For example, if Lu Ming cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture to its peak and then cultivated another divine technique, he could light another divine fire beside the original divine fire.</p><p>Every time he cultivated a different divine technique, he would be able to light up another divine flame. These divine flames would increase in power as his ruler’s divine power increased.</p><p>Heaven-defying, this was simply heaven-defying!</p><p>One had to know that an ordinary person could only cultivate one divine fire.</p><p>According to the records of the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture, it was possible to cultivate an infinite number of divine flames, as long as one had different divine techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed. His heart was burning with pa.s.sion.</p><p>Such a divine technique was truly heaven-defying.</p><p>The last paragraph of the ” universe thousand Dao Scripture ” was Jing Yu’s annotation.</p><p>Jing Yu said. Jing Yu had acquired the [ universe myriad Dao Art ] from a forbidden region. Jing Yu had relied on the [ universe myriad Dao Art ] to master hegemon-level divine power.</p><p>Jingyu was not like Lu Ming, who had not cultivated any divine techniques and could control the divine power of a G.o.d.</p><p>“Start cultivating!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to experience the profoundness of the universe thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>The [ universe thousand Dao Scripture ] had a total of twelve stages. Only by cultivating to the twelfth stage would one be able to control hegemon divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes and began to cultivate according to the instructions. He opened his eyes after a few minutes.</p><p>That was because he had successfully cultivated the first level, and his speed was astonishing.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate. After a while, Lu Ming had cultivated to the second level, then the third level …</p><p>In a short half an hour, Lu Ming had cultivated to the sixth level in one go.</p><p>This was very normal. When one cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture to the twelfth stage, one would be able to control ruler’s divine power. However, Lu Ming had already controlled the ruler’s divine power to begin with. Cultivating the universe thousand Dao Scripture was naturally like riding a rocket. There was no bottleneck and he soared all the way.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that as he cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture more and more, the divine power in his body was also gradually becoming more robust. He was slowly approaching the second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was even more adept at using the ruler’s divine power. He had also discovered many of the mysteries of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had no direction when he cultivated the ruler’s divine power. He had to figure it out on his own and comprehend Jingyu’s portrait, moving forward in a blur.</p><p>Now, with the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture, Lu Ming had a direction, a direction, and a path. This way, he could truly unleash some of the mysteries of the ruler’s strength.</p><p>Continue, continue …</p><p>Lu Ming buried himself in cultivation.</p><p>Towards the end of his cultivation, his progress slowed down slightly. However, three days later, Lu Ming had still cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture to the highest level, the twelfth stage.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When Lu Ming had cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture to the twelfth stage, the divine fire burned fiercely in his dantian and his body grew bigger.</p><p>The divine power in his body surged and became much stronger.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>His cultivation had broken through to the second level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
