Cave dwelling, so that’s how it is. It must be the cave dwelling of an expert!”</p><p>“The people of the yuanluo Palace must be after this cave. Hmph, they can forget about monopolizing it. We’ll wait here for the general and then we’ll kill our way back!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The zhengtian Army was shocked to hear that there was a cave dwelling in the chenjin mine.</p><p>They had been excavating the ancient gold mine for so many years, but they had not found anything.</p><p>Immediately, the people of the righteous sky Army began to wait.</p><p>Old gold mine!</p><p>some of you will stay outside to guard the place. The rest will follow me in and explore the place first!</p><p>A tall and st.u.r.dy old man instructed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Everyone bowed and accepted the order. They looked at the old man with respect in their eyes.</p><p>That was because this old man was a top expert of the yuanluo Palace, a terrifying true G.o.d expert.</p><p>Every true G.o.d was a top expert in the yuanluo Palace. They had the power to control a region and had the power to kill.</p><p>Under the elder’s arrangement, a group of people from the yuanluo Palace stayed outside the cave while the rest followed the elder down.</p><p>……</p><p>A hundred thousand miles away, Lu Ming and the rest were waiting quietly. Lu Ming was also sitting cross-legged on the sea to rest.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu opened its mouth wide and bit down hard. Its eyes were staring straight in the direction of the Chen gold mine.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu’s mouth continued to close, and its teeth clattered. It even extended a tentacle and pointed in the direction of the Chen gold mine, revealing a look of desire.</p><p>“You want to go to the chenjin mine?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu’s round body rolled a few times.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go with you, but be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment.</p><p>He was also quite curious and wanted to see what was going on with the cave dwelling in the chenjin mine.</p><p>QiuQiu transformed into a bangle and wore it on Lu Ming’s hand. Lu Ming did not tell anyone and headed to the chenjin ore vein alone.</p><p>The distance of a hundred thousand miles was covered in a short while.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>As he neared the ancient gold mine, Lu Ming discovered that there were at least a few thousand origin Luo Hall powerhouses on the island.</p><p>with so many experts, it’s impossible to approach them head-on. What should we do? ”</p><p>“That’s right, from the sea …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He dived into the sea and kept diving. He dived to a depth of one thousand meters and then approached Chen Jin Island.</p><p>There was no one from the yuanluo Palace guarding the sea because the entire Island was filled with ancient gold mines. They were not worried.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the bottom of chenjing Island.</p><p>When it arrived, QiuQiu flew out and opened its mouth wide, biting down on Chen jindao.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>QiuQiu’s speed was very fast. Very quickly, a large hole was bitten in Chen jindao. It continued to push in, and soon a pa.s.sage appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Perhaps, they could use this to enter Chen jindao’s cave abode.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy and followed closely behind QiuQiu.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka ka …</p><p>QiuQiu’s speed became faster and faster as it headed deeper into the island.</p><p>Originally, Chen jindao’s mine vein was extremely hard. Even an expert would find it difficult to dig a tunnel.</p><p>It would also cause a huge commotion, and the experts of the yuanluo Palace on the island would notice.</p><p>However, QiuQiu’s gnawing of the Chen gold mine did not seem to cause any movement.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><p>QiuQiu, be careful. There’s movement ahead!</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p>That was because a series of rumbles came from the front. It seemed like a great battle was happening.</p><p>QiuQiu slowed down a little. When its mouth bit on those mineral veins, there was no sound at all.</p><p>A moment later, the mine vein seemed to have been dug through, revealing a gap.</p><p>Lu Ming looked outside through the gap and took in the scenery outside.</p><p>Outside, there was a huge building made of a kind of Black Rock. It was so huge that one couldn’t see the end of it.</p><p>At the very front of the building, there was a huge door. At this moment, a group of people were bombarding the door.</p><p>However, it was obvious that there was a formation set up at the gate. There were rays of light shining, and the group of people kept bombarding it, but they could not break the formation at all.</p><p>One of the elders had an extremely terrifying aura. Each of his moves was extremely powerful and bombarded the array of the gate.</p><p>“What a terrifying expert!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Even though there was still a long distance between them, the aura that the elder emitted still made him apprehensive.</p><p>the yuanluo Palace already has such a terrifying expert. This cave is definitely not a small matter!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>However, the experts of the yuanluo Palace kept attacking, but they couldn’t break the formation.</p><p>d.a.m.n it, the defensive power of this formation is too strong. Even the surrounding walls are protected by the formation. We can’t break it at all. Now, we can only wait for the palace Master and the others to come and find a way to break it!</p><p>After bombarding for a while, the old man stopped and said unhappily.</p><p>The people from the yuanluo Palace were helpless and could only stop and wait.</p><p>“QiuQiu, let’s leave …”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered to QiuQiu. Then, QiuQiu changed its direction and left the place. It then approached the building. Not long after, the mine vein disappeared and a dark wall blocked them.</p><p>This wall was the wall of the building.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a divine combat sword and slashed the wall. However, there was not a single mark.</p><p>the stone material of this wall is very special. It’s hard and immortal. There’s also the power of a great formation on it, so it’s impossible to break it. It seems that we can only stop here!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>This cave abode was able to attract so many people from the yuanluo Palace, so it must be extraordinary. If they could sneak in and obtain some treasures, they would definitely make a fortune. Lu Ming was also tempted, but unfortunately, he could not enter.</p><p>Right at this moment, QiuQiu opened its mouth wide and started biting the wall.</p><p>Ka-bang!</p><p>A small piece of the wall was bitten off.</p><p>“This … This works too?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded and tongue-tied.</p><p>There was a formation on the wall that even the terrifying old man from the yuanluo Palace couldn’t break, but QiuQiu could.</p><p>This directly ignored the formation!</p><p>Now, Lu Ming only had one feeling. QiuQiu’s teeth were too sharp.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu bit down with all its might. Although it wasn’t biting very fast and could only bite off a small piece each time, if this continued, it would definitely be able to bite through the wall and enter the building.</p><p>Lu Ming was waiting with antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>At this moment, more and more powerhouses from Chen Jin’s branch of the yuanluo Palace were gathering.</p><p>And 100,000 miles away, there were more and more powerhouses in the righteous Army.</p><p>However, neither side made a move. They were also waiting, waiting for the arrival of the strongest experts from both sides.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
