The material of the divine artifact fragments was no small matter, so QiuQiu naturally didn’t digest them so quickly.</p><p>Moreover, it would stop to digest every piece it ate.</p><p>Lu Ming did not bother with QiuQiu and cultivated alone at the side.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year pa.s.sed.</p><p>QiuQiu devoured all the divine artifact fragments that Lu Ming had bought. It finally evolved again and its cultivation advanced to the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have any divine artifact fragments for it. He could only give some ordinary metal-attribute crafting materials to QiuQiu to eat while Lu Ming continued to comprehend and cultivate.</p><p>Just like that, five years pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>After five years of hard work, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>His cultivation had improved again, and he had become a five star heavenly Emperor. Of course, he had also used more than 10000 divine crystals.</p><p>In addition, his understanding of the battle symbol art was getting deeper and deeper. Now, when he used the battle symbol art, it increased his attack power more and more.</p><p>Furthermore, the chances of triggering the double combat strength were getting higher and higher. On average, it only took two tries to trigger it.</p><p>However, he seemed to have reached a bottleneck in his cultivation of the battle character formula. It had been a while since Lu Ming had made any progress.</p><p>just bitter cultivation isn’t enough. I still need to go out and take risks to temper myself!</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and pondered in his heart.</p><p>&Nbsp; if he didn’t encounter a bottleneck, then he could just cultivate quietly. But once he did, the effect wouldn’t be great. He needed to fight to gain inspiration and break through.</p><p>This was also the reason why many people would often go out and adventure. Not only could they obtain opportunities, but they could also temper themselves and break through bottlenecks.</p><p>“Let’s go to the righteous Army and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked out and headed toward the righteous Army.</p><p>When they arrived at the righteous Army Headquarters, no one stopped them. Although Lu Ming and the rest had not officially joined the righteous Army, the righteous Army had already treated them as a part of it.</p><p>08:13</p><p>When they arrived at the righteous Army Headquarters, no one stopped them. Although Lu Ming and the rest had not officially joined the righteous Army, the righteous Army had already treated them as a part of it.</p><p>There was a Mission Hall in the righteous Army Headquarters.</p><p>In fact, most of the forces would have this kind of mission Palace.</p><p>“Senior, is there anyone suitable for ethereal G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming went to a counter and asked a white-haired elder.</p><p>“The biggest and most frequent mission recently is naturally the battle with the yuan Luo Palace and the carefree sect!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“The yuanluo Palace and the carefree sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>that’s right. In the past few years, the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect have joined forces to attack some of the vital planets controlled by our Righteous Army. Our Righteous Army has also been sending experts to fight the two sides. Anyone who kills the yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect will be rewarded!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>“The yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect are working together? Is it because I beat up that situ Xiao last time?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think this way.</p><p>“Hmph, that walkabout sect has long wanted to join forces with the yuan Luo Palace to deal with my Righteous Army. Now, they’ve finally made their move. Little guy, do you want to take this mission? if you take this mission, I’ll help you register!”</p><p>The white-haired old man asked.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll accept this mission!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that the two sides did not attack him because he had beaten up situ Xiao. Instead, the origin Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect had planned to join forces for a long time.</p><p>Very soon, the old man completed the procedures for Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ve helped you register. Many people have accepted this mission recently. Come here tomorrow morning and meet up with the others. We’ll set off for the northern merchant planet together!”</p><p>The white-haired elder gave Lu Ming a black iron token.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and left the place.</p><p>A day pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye. The next morning, Lu Ming returned to the missions Hall.</p><p>“Those who are on a mission to North merchant planet, meet here!”</p><p>The moment Lu Ming arrived, he heard someone shouting in the missions Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over.</p><p>“Brother, are you going to North merchant planet for a mission?”</p><p>The burly man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the black iron token.</p><p>alright, then we’ll wait here for now. When most of the people are here, we’ll set off!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked to the side.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more people gathered.</p><p>Half an hour later, more than 200 people had gathered there. They were all going to North Shang planet to carry out missions. All of them were at the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Alright, we’re almost there. Let’s go!”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Everyone headed towards the teleportation array.</p><p>One teleportation array couldn’t teleport so many people at once, so they had to take turns.</p><p>Groups of people went up and stepped into the teleportation array, disappearing into it.</p><p>Soon, it was Lu Ming’s turn. He stepped into the teleportation array and appeared on a flat ground.</p><p>“This place is … An Island!”</p><p>As soon as he appeared, Lu Ming could hear the sound of waves crashing from all directions. There was also a salty sea breeze blowing, making him feel refreshed.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and looked around. He realized that he was indeed on an island. The island was not big and he could see the boundless ocean at a glance.</p><p>Soon, everyone had pa.s.sed through the teleportation array.</p><p>follow me. We’ll head to Seven Star Island first before we a.s.sign you your tasks. Also, I’ll explain the current situation on the northern merchant planet to you on the way!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Everyone followed the burly man and flew out of the island, flying towards the vast sea.</p><p>The big man’s name was pan Jiang. He had always been stationed on planet North Shang. This time, he had come specifically to pick them up.</p><p>On the way, pan Jiang explained the current situation on North business planet.</p><p>The situation on the northern Shang planet was a bit special. It was located on the border between the righteous heaven Army and the origin Hall, so it had become a place that the two forces had to fight for.</p><p>Thus, half of the planet was occupied by the righteous Army and half by the origin Hall.</p><p>The northern Shang continent and ocean each took up fifty percent of the planet’s surface area.</p><p>The righteous heaven Army occupied the northern Shang’s ocean and Ocean islands to develop the resources there.</p><p>As for the origin Luo Hall, they occupied a portion of the northern Shang planet’s land and exploited all the resources there.</p><p>The two sides often fought each other, and there would often be experts from the righteous sky Army who would secretly enter the northern Shang planet to kill people from the yuanluo Palace and seize the resources.</p><p>Or, there were people from the yuanluo Palace who sneaked into the islands to kill the experts of the righteous Army.</p><p>In short, the two sides had never stopped killing each other. However, in the past two years, the yuan Luo Palace had invested more forces on the North Shang planet, and the killing between the two sides had become more frequent.</p><p>The righteous heaven Army had also been increasing the strength of the northern Shang planet.</p><p>The seven Star Island was the righteous sky Army’s headquarters on the northern Shang planet.</p><p>After flying across the vast ocean, they pa.s.sed by many islands. Three days later, they finally arrived at Seven Star Island.</p><p>The seven Star Island was huge. Although it was called an Island, it was actually no different from a continent.</p><p>At least, in Lu Ming’s opinion, the area of the seven Star Island was definitely not smaller than the great pure heaven in the heaven realm.</p><p>People were coming and going on the seven Star Island. There were a lot of them, and they were all experts. At first glance, there were no less than several thousand of them, and all of them were at the ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It was only Seven Star Island and there were already so many experts. One could imagine the strength of the entire Righteous Army.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
