After killing Deng Yu, his ranking rose to 17th in the 20th district!</p><p>After all, there were more than 50000 people in the 20th district and 18 megacities. Some people fought almost non-stop, so it was normal to have more points than him.</p><p>terrifying, he’s really terrifying. Even Deng Yu isn’t his match!</p><p>“My G.o.d! This person’s battle strength is truly astonishing. I never thought that the chaotic astral River would actually produce such a person. I think that with his strength, he can probably charge into the top 100 of the overall ranking!”</p><p>it’s very likely. We’ll have to see his battles with his other opponents in the second round of the a.s.sessment!</p><p>&Nbsp; the people watching from all around were shocked to the extreme, unable to calm down.</p><p>Deng Yu was publicly acknowledged as the most powerful person in this city. However, he was killed by Lu Ming in the end.</p><p>At this moment, in Wanling city, the people of the chaotic astral River were already in an uproar.</p><p>“Lu Ming’s ranking has risen again. He has risen again!”</p><p>he’s actually reached the seventeenth place in the twentieth zone. This is too shocking!</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>amazing! This time, the righteous heavenly Army is amazing!</p><p>Many people sighed with emotion.</p><p>There was less than a day left before the first round of the a.s.sessment was about to end.</p><p>This time, there were a total of five people from the righteous Army, and they were ranked in the top 100 in their respective regions.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were in their respective zones, from 70th to 80th.</p><p>“Are the two of them hiding their strength?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique muttered.</p><p>He knew about Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s talents. Both of them had mastered the divine power.</p><p>To be able to control the divine grade divine power as soon as she broke through to the martial G.o.d Realm, her comprehension ability was definitely not low. However, under normal circ.u.mstances, their ranking would not be so low.</p><p>Then there was only one possibility. They were hiding their strength. Seeing that they were about to advance, they stopped.</p><p>On the other hand, Tong Xi ‘er and dandan were ranked higher.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was ranked 53rd in her region.</p><p>Dandan, ranked 36th!</p><p>In addition to Lu Ming and the righteous sky Army, there were a total of five people who made it into the top hundred of their respective zones.</p><p>Even the Yunfeng Pavilion master would be envious of such a result. After all, only three people from the Yunfeng Pavilion had made it into the top 100 of their respective regions.</p><p>As for Kang Ji and situ haonan, they were so jealous that they were about to go crazy.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“The heavens are unfair!”</p><p>The two of them roared in their hearts.</p><p>“Previously, someone said that Lu Ming relied on luck and would definitely be killed later on. What about now?”</p><p>Fa Ming’s voice was filled with ridicule as he looked towards situ haonan and Kang Ji.</p><p>The two of them were so angry that their lungs were about to explode. At the same time, they started to panic.</p><p>There were so many heaven’s favorites in the righteous Army, especially Lu Ming. He actually made it to the 17th place in zone 20. With such talent, if they all joined the Qin Tian thirteen clans, the origin Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect would not have any good days.</p><p>The only thing they were happy about was that situ Feng’s ranking was not low either. In his region, he was ranked 26th.</p><p>it’s still too early to talk about this. Let’s see who will be able to join the three Overlord forces in the second round!</p><p>Situ haonan gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>……</p><p>Time, there was less than a day’s time until the end of this round of a.s.sessment.</p><p>On the last day, the ma.s.sacre in the twenty regions became even more frenzied.</p><p>That was because once they entered the top 100 of their respective regions, it was almost certain that they would be able to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>However, once they were eliminated, it would be a different story. They would not be able to make their own choices.</p><p>Furthermore, even if one didn’t enter the top 100, as long as one’s points were high, the chances of being selected by the Qin heaven 13 clans would be higher.</p><p>Therefore, everyone went crazy!</p><p>Crazy killing, crazy killing!</p><p>my ranking is 103. As long as I kill him, I can enter the top 100!</p><p>In the third region, a young Tauren was madly charging at his opponent.</p><p>In the sixth region, a young man was madly chasing after another young man. However, the other party was running away madly, causing the young man to roar madly.</p><p>Just a little more!</p><p>He was just a little bit away, but the other party would not let him kill him so easily. For a moment, he could not catch up with the other party and was extremely anxious.</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were red as they madly fought.</p><p>This was related to their future and their destiny. It would be strange if they weren’t crazy.</p><p>In the twenty regions, in the cities, crazy killing was happening everywhere.</p><p>However, there were some people who no one dared to provoke. Once they saw them, their expressions changed drastically and they immediately fled.</p><p>For example, Golden Saint, Hu ya, yang Chong, Linghu ye, and others.</p><p>They were all the Kings of their respective regions, and they were ranked first.</p><p>In the twentieth zone, where Lu Ming and Deng Yu had fought, Lu Ming did not leave. He sat cross-legged and comprehended the incomplete divine skill, waiting for the time to come.</p><p>However, none of them dared to provoke Lu Ming. They did not even dare to get too close to him.</p><p>Although everyone knew that Lu Ming had a shocking number of points, who would dare to have any ideas about him?</p><p>Unless he didn’t want to live anymore!</p><p>Time pa.s.sed by quickly.</p><p>When the three months were up, his body seemed to be pulled by a force, and he turned into a rainbow light and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that his spiritual will had returned to his body. They were still in one of the rooms in the inn.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, Tong Xi ‘er, and dandan had also woken up.</p><p>The Jade talismans above their heads glowed, and words appeared on them. Everyone’s points and ranking could be clearly seen.</p><p>With a glance, everything was clear.</p><p>“Little Qing and Xie nianjun …”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly surprised. Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s ranking was slightly low.</p><p>perhaps they’re hiding their strength!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>At this moment, the rankings on the 20 huge screens had been completely fixed.</p><p>This time, a total of 15 people from the chaotic astral River have entered the top 100 of their respective regions.</p><p>The righteous Army became the biggest winner, with five people.</p><p>Even the Yunfeng Pavilion only had three people.</p><p>As for situ Feng, situ Xiao, Kang long, and the others, only situ Feng had made it into the top 100.</p><p>quick, record down the top rankings of your respective regions. It’ll be best if you can get into the top 5000!</p><p>the top 10000 of each region can be recorded. These are the geniuses acc.u.mulated in the entire Qin Tian Starfield over 1000 years!</p><p>At this moment, many people began to record the rankings on the screen.</p><p>These people came from some of the smaller factions in the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>In the Qin heaven Star Zone, other than the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, there were many other small powers. Their strength was far inferior to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, but compared to powers like the Yunfeng Pavilion, they were still much stronger.</p><p>These forces knew that those who were ranked higher would definitely not join them.</p><p>Hence, they targeted those who were ranked slightly lower. These people might not catch the attention of the Qin heaven thirteen clans, but they did.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
