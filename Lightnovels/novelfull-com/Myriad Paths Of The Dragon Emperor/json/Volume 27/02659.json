The future sect master would definitely be born from these people.</p><p>These Holy Sons, Holy G.o.ddesses, and divine sons were equivalent to the princes of an Empire.</p><p>Every one of them had the support of many people in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The outer disciples, inner disciples, outer elders, and even inner elders all had their own supporters.</p><p>As long as the person they supported became the sect leader in the future, then the people of this faction would naturally rise to the heavens.</p><p>It could be said that these factions were extremely powerful in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>In fact, it wasn’t just the Kong Xuan sect that was like this. The Qin heaven thirteen clans and the other sects were the same.</p><p>The golden-haired young man and the others belonged to one of the Holy Sons, the Tianhong Holy son’s faction.</p><p>When they heard that Lu Ming was the top scorer of this batch of a.s.sessment, they wanted to rope him in to join the Tianhong sect.</p><p>“How is it? Join the Tianhong faction. It will be very beneficial to you!”</p><p>The golden-haired youth said.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I don’t have any plans to join any faction at the moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The main reason he had come to the Kong Xuan sect was to use the sect’s resources to cultivate, and he had no intention of getting involved in the struggle between the various factions.</p><p>Hearing Lu Ming’s rejection, the golden-haired young man and the other young men frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming, I know that you offended Huang Wu a few days ago. Let me tell you, Huang Wu’s background is not simple. His elder brother is a prodigy among the inner disciples, and his master is a powerful inner elder. Moreover, they belong to the sacred son’s faction, the sacred son of reflection. Huang Wu will definitely take revenge on you!</p><p>as long as you join the Tianhong Saint son, you’ll be under our protection. Huang Wu won’t be able to do anything to you!</p><p>The golden-haired youth said.</p><p>I’m sorry, but I really don’t intend to join any faction!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and refused again.</p><p>Needless to say, once he joined a sect, he would become the sect’s hatchet man and tool. Lu Ming was not interested in working for a certain Holy Son.</p><p>In addition, the att.i.tude of the young man in luxurious clothes made Lu Ming very unhappy. He did not have a good impression of the people from the Tian Hong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>Moreover, although the golden-haired young man was smiling, his tone was very cold and arrogant, as if he was high and mighty, looking down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, don’t be so shameless. Don’t think that you’re so great just because you got first place. The disciple recruitment test of the thirteen clans only happens once every thousand years. Over the countless years, people like you can be found everywhere!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes slammed the table and scolded with a cold face.</p><p>that’s right. We invited you to join the Tianhong Saint son because we think highly of you. Don’t think too highly of yourself. You won’t even know how you died!</p><p>Another young man said coldly.</p><p>“Oh, since you don’t welcome me, I’ll leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He then stood up and was about to leave.</p><p>stop! You can come and go as you please? what do you think this place is? ”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes suddenly stood up and scolded.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. You were the one who invited me here. Otherwise, do you think I would come? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Kid, what’s with your att.i.tude? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes shouted coldly and circulated his divine power. A strong divine power burst out and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Seventh level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>This young man was at the 7th level of the void G.o.d Realm and was much stronger than Huang Wu.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power, ready to strike at any moment. No matter how powerful the other party was, Lu Ming would not allow himself to be captured without putting up a fight.</p><p>“What’s wrong? This is the style of the Tianhong Saint son’s faction. If they don’t agree to join, they’ll take action. If this matter gets out, we’ll see who will still join the Tianhong Saint son’s faction!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“You … You dare to threaten me?”</p><p>The eyes of the young man in luxurious clothes turned even colder, and he was about to make a move.</p><p>“Let him go!”</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the golden-haired young man sounded.</p><p>“Big brother Ying …”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes said anxiously.</p><p>let him go. We, the Tianhong Saint son’s faction, will not force him!</p><p>The golden-haired young man raised his hand. The young man in luxurious clothes had no choice but to retract his aura.</p><p>Lu Ming strode away without looking back.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, the young man in luxurious clothes said unhappily, ” “Brother Ying, why didn’t you let me teach Lu Ming a lesson? this guy doesn’t know what’s good for him …”</p><p>that’s right. For him to be able to get first place, his talent is not bad. If we let him join another faction, it will not be good for us!</p><p>Another young man said.</p><p>don’t worry. If he doesn’t join our faction, he’ll be an enemy if he joins another faction. Such a person can’t be allowed to live in this world!</p><p>inform the others that if they meet this person outside, they can kill him when they have the chance. However, I’m afraid he won’t be able to pa.s.s Huang Wu’s test. We’ll just wait and watch a good show!</p><p>The golden-haired youth said coldly. His previous smile had disappeared, and only killing intent remained.</p><p>Since Lu Ming had gotten first place in the a.s.sessment, he must be quite talented. He had wanted to recruit Lu Ming under the Tianhong Saint son.</p><p>After all, there was a reward for recruiting a genius. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so stubborn.</p><p>……</p><p>I didn’t expect the relationships within the Kong Xuan sect to be so complicated. Forget it, I’ll focus on raising my strength first!</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows when he returned to the courtyard.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s waters ran deep, and only by being strong could one not be afraid of the outside world.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately continued to refine the transformation and spirit strengthening pill and cultivate.</p><p>In another luxurious courtyard in the outer court of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>This courtyard was Huang Wu’s.</p><p>&Nbsp; now that Huang Wu’s injuries had healed, he was in a meeting with his lackeys.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want him to die a terrible death!”</p><p>Huang Wu said with a cold expression.</p><p>“Senior brother Huang Wu, should we report this to senior brother Huang Wen and ask him to send someone to deal with Lu Ming?”</p><p>One of the lackeys suggested.</p><p>Huang Wen was Huang Wu’s elder brother.</p><p>my elder brother has been in seclusion to break through to the next realm. There’s no need to disturb him over such a small matter. Go and call the Liu brothers over. Let them cripple Lu Ming!</p><p>Huang Wu said.</p><p>senior brother, you’re so wise. The Liu brothers are both at sixth level void G.o.d Realm. If they join forces, they’ll be able to crush Lu Ming. I’ll go get them now!</p><p>One of the lackeys said.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s courtyard, he was refining the effects of the spirit strengthening pill when suddenly, a loud roar came from outside.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>His voice was so loud that Lu Ming’s courtyard was trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>No one would be in a good mood if they were disturbed during cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and walked out of the courtyard. He saw a few figures standing in front of him.</p><p>“Huang Wu!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Huang Wu at one glance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
