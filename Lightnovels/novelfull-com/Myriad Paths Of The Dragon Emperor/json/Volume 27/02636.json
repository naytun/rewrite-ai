It was divided into four Urban area, North, South, East, and West.</p><p>There were a few top experts in each Urban area.</p><p>However, there was an expert in the North, South, East, and West who was publicly acknowledged as the number one expert. That person was Deng Yu.</p><p>He was the number one expert in this city, a top genius.</p><p>At least, in this city, no one could match him. He had earned his reputation by killing.</p><p>And now, Deng Yu had appeared. Could it be that he wanted to fight Lu Ming?</p><p>Many people revealed looks of antic.i.p.ation!</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were also extremely shocking. Tiger bone, one of the top experts in the Dongcheng Area, was completely crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>They really wanted to know who was stronger, Lu Ming or Deng Yu?</p><p>“You are very strong. I didn’t expect that this city would have an expert like you!”</p><p>Deng Yu stopped and landed on a house. He looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Deng Yu?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>He had heard the human youth mention it before, and now that he saw Deng Yu, he immediately thought of it.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Deng Yu nodded. He looked at Lu Ming with a strong fighting spirit in his eyes.</p><p>I was planning to go to other cities and challenge experts, but it seems that there’s no need for that now!</p><p>The battle intent in Deng Yu’s eyes grew stronger as he spoke.</p><p>“You want to fight, that’s exactly what I want!”</p><p>Lu Ming also revealed his fighting spirit.</p><p>“No, you and I have a battle, but not now!”</p><p>Deng Yu shook his head.</p><p>“Not now?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>to be honest, you’re very strong. I can’t see through you at all. I don’t have the confidence to fight you!</p><p>perhaps I will die in your hands. I don’t have enough points now. If I lose half of my points, I’m not sure if I can make it into the top 100. So, how about we have a battle? when the three-month deadline is almost up, we’ll fight here. How about it? ”</p><p>to be honest, you’re very strong. I can’t see through you at all. I don’t have the confidence to fight you!</p><p>perhaps I will die in your hands. I don’t have enough points now. If I lose half of my points, I’m not sure if I can make it into the top 100. So, how about we have a battle? when the three-month deadline is almost up, we’ll fight here. How about it? ”</p><p>Deng Yu said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and nodded in agreement.</p><p>He understood Deng Yu’s thoughts. If he was killed by Lu Ming now, his points would be reduced by half. He was not confident that he could steadily enter the top hundred.</p><p>Therefore, during this period of time, he would go and obtain more points. When he had enough points, even if his points were halved, he could still firmly enter the top 100.</p><p>There were a total of thirty-six swords, and their sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged toward Deng Yu as one with his spear.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Deng Yu waved his hand. Thirty-six combat swords formed a strange combination and continuously stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear and Deng Yu’s combat sword kept colliding with each other, and the force was overflowing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“This Deng Yu is not weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>He could sense Deng Yu’s overall combat strength as soon as they exchanged blows.</p><p>The divine power that Deng Yu controlled was also King grade divine power, but it was much stronger than the average King grade divine power.</p><p>Shen power of the same level also had differences in strength. Some of them were very different in power.</p><p>For example, Tong Xi ‘er and Kang long both controlled King grade divine power, but Tong Xi’ er’s King grade divine power was stronger than Kang Long’s by a level.</p><p>This Deng Yu was also the same. His King grade divine power was not weaker than Tong Xi ‘er’s, and was even stronger.</p><p>Moreover, his incomplete divine skill had also reached the peak of the second stage. His battle sense was also very strong.</p><p>In terms of overall combat strength, he was much stronger than tiger bone.</p><p>No wonder he could become the number one expert in this city.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing, again, again!”</p><p>After exchanging dozens of moves, the fighting spirit in Deng Yu’s eyes grew stronger and stronger. He waved his hands and sword-light surged. Thirty-six combat swords continuously rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Each attack was shockingly powerful and unpredictable.</p><p>“It seems like I need to increase the power of the ruler’s power!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>&Nbsp; when he had fought with others before, he had not used all of his ruler power. What he had used had only been the power of ordinary divine power.</p><p>At this moment, he had used his power of domination to unleash a power equivalent to King-grade divine power.</p><p>Instantly, his combat strength increased by a notch. The Spear’s radiance surged and swept away Deng Yu’s sword radiance.</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The long spear trembled and turned into a flash of spear radiance as fast as lightning. It was like a fairy from beyond the heavens, shattering the void.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance burst forth with seven layers of energy, and the remaining sword radiance of Deng Yu was completely destroyed. In the next moment, the spear radiance pierced through Deng Yu’s chest.</p><p>Deng Yu’s body stiffened in the air.</p><p>amazing, amazing. I’m completely convinced of my defeat!</p><p>Deng Yu smiled. Then, his body turned into energy and disappeared with a bang.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
