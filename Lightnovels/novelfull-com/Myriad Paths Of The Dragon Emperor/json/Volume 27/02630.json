On these 20 huge screens, there were names.</p><p>On each screen, there were more than 50000 names.</p><p>All of them were the names of the partic.i.p.ants. Behind each name, there was a corresponding Galaxy.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s name appeared in the twentieth zone. Behind the name, it was marked with the words ‘chaotic astral River’.</p><p>Xie nianqing was in the first region, while Xie nianjun was in the third region.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er was in the tenth region, and dandan was in the eighteenth region.</p><p>“Quick, find out which District Kang long is in!”</p><p>“Also, Feng ‘er, Xiao’ er is in that area!”</p><p>In the crowd, Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others started to search.</p><p>With their eyesight, they could naturally see a thousand things with a single glance. Their speed was amazing, and it didn’t take long for them to find the area where Kang long, situ Xiao, situ Feng, and the others were.</p><p>This time, over a thousand people had come to the chaotic astral River under the leadership of the master of the Yunfeng Pavilion. They had all come to watch the battle.</p><p>The ancestor of technique was also among them, not far from Kang long and the others.</p><p>They weren’t the only ones. People from the other galaxies were also looking for the heaven’s favorites from their own factions.</p><p>At the moment, the names appeared randomly, but once the fight started, the names would be arranged according to the score.</p><p>The one with the highest score would be in first place until the end of the three months. The top 100 geniuses in each region would be the victors, and the others would be eliminated.</p><p>They only looked at the points, not whether they were killed.</p><p>As long as you had enough points to rank in the top 100, you could advance even if you were killed.</p><p>“It’s starting, it’s starting, the sixth region, Hu ya has points, so fast, already three points!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>In the beginning, each of them only had one point. One point for each person they killed.</p><p>In other words, Hu ya had already killed three people.</p><p>in the other areas, the Golden Sage is not any slower!</p><p>the killing has started. Many people have acc.u.mulated points!</p><p>The names on the 20 screens kept flashing.</p><p>Some names would appear in the first, second, or even higher positions. The corresponding points would also appear behind the names.</p><p>There were more than a million names flashing non-stop. Only the experts present could see them clearly. If it were an ordinary person, they would have been dazzled with a single glance.</p><p>The 20th region!</p><p>Lu Ming opened the door and walked out.</p><p>“Did I just appear in a city?”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that he was now in a courtyard. He could see other tall buildings in other places.</p><p>wait, we can’t fly in this area!</p><p>Lu Ming was about to soar into the sky to observe the situation when he suddenly felt that his body was as heavy as a mountain. He could not fly at all.</p><p>Flying was prohibited in this area.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent roar came from a tall building not far away.</p><p>The building rumbled and the walls exploded. Lu Ming saw two figures engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p>The two of them had similar combat strength. In the intense battle, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the door of the courtyard that Lu Ming was in was blasted open. Broken wood flew in all directions and a tall and burly figure walked in.</p><p>The person glanced at the badge on Lu Ming’s chest and revealed a sinister sneer.”A piece of trash from the chaotic astral River just happened to become the first person I killed and my first point!”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The man stepped forward and condensed a saber with his divine power, slashing it at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was an incomplete divine skill that he had cultivated. The blade light was extremely fast and filled with a brutal aura.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was calm. He condensed a long spear with the power of the ruler in his hand and thrust it out.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear was as fast as lightning, and in the blink of an eye, five changes occurred.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The other party wanted to block it, but for a moment, he did not know how to block it.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through the area between the opponent’s eyebrows.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>The other party’s eyes were wide open, and his face was full of disbelief.</p><p>Initially, he had wanted to kill Lu Ming and let him be the first point he had obtained. He did not expect to die in Lu Ming’s hands in one move.</p><p>How could a person from the chaotic astral River be so powerful?</p><p>“I’m sorry, but what you said is exactly what I wanted to say. It’s your honor to contribute your first point to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Then, he shook the long spear and the other party’s body was torn into pieces, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>Of course, there were two chances this time. The other party could still resurrect in other places and continue to fight.</p><p>If he died a second time, he would have no more chances. The points would be the same.</p><p>After killing one person, the badge on Lu Ming’s chest suddenly glowed with a faint light. A message appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Lu Ming: twentieth region. From the chaotic astral River. One point. Ranking: 28560.”</p><p>“So this badge has this use!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>This way, he would be able to know his ranking at all times.</p><p>“Three months is enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked out of the courtyard.</p><p>After walking out of the courtyard, they arrived at a wide street.</p><p>On both sides of the street, there were all kinds of buildings.</p><p>At this moment, the outcome of the battle had already been decided. One of them was killed, but the other was injured. He didn’t dare to stay any longer and fled in the dark.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed up to a house. Then, he started to run around the room.</p><p>It was very dangerous to do so. It was easy to be targeted by others. However, Lu Ming did this on purpose.</p><p>Instead of looking for those people one by one, it was better to let others find him.</p><p>As expected, someone made a move!</p><p>From one of the buildings, a figure pounced on Lu Ming like an arrow. At the same time, a sharp sword light stabbed at Lu Ming’s forehead.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming fired a shot with his backhand.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear hit the sword light of the other party. The other party’s body shook violently and was thrown back. Blood spurted out of his mouth and his eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>He could clearly sense that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the transformation void martial stage and had not reached the void G.o.d stage.</p><p>As for him, although his cultivation base was suppressed here, he was still at first level void G.o.d Realm. However, he was sent flying by Lu Ming and suffered serious injuries in an instant.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stomped his feet heavily and his figure shot out. At the same time, a sharp spear gleam pierced through the void and killed the other party in the air.</p><p>He was killed easily!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change.</p><p>The divine power that the other party controlled was just ordinary divine power. Although Lu Ming’s cultivation level was not as high as the other party’s, the other party was suppressed to first-level virtual G.o.d-level, so he could easily kill him.</p><p>This was under the premise that he could not use the battle formula. If he could use the battle formula, Lu Ming’s abilities would be even more shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
