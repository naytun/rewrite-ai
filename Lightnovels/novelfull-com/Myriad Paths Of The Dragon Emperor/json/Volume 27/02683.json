Then, they could sit down and collect the divine crystals.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the fighting ring, a terrifying aura burst out from Dongfang Hao’s body. The divine power of a peak ninth level virtual G.o.d Realm expert was fully unleashed, forming a powerful wave of divine power that pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body was like a rock, not moving at all.</p><p>you’re quite capable. I’d like to see how capable you are to dare to accept my life-and-death duel invitation!</p><p>Dongfang Hao said coldly. Then, he took a step forward and charged toward Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His palm was like a knife, and he slashed at Lu Ming. Although it was a palm, the knife force was extremely sharp, wanting to cut Lu Ming in half.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. His divine power shook Dongfang Hao’s wave of divine power away and he threw a punch at it.</p><p>you actually didn’t use a divine artifact to take my attack. You’re really looking for death. This attack will split you in half!</p><p>Dongfang Hao roared in his heart as he struck Lu Ming’s fist with his palm.</p><p>On the fighting ring, there was a m.u.f.fled boom, like the vibration of a heavenly drum. Then, circles of strong Qi ripples spread out in all directions, and a level 12 wind seemed to be blowing on the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, the two figures floated back hundreds of meters.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people’s pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p>It was blocked. Lu Ming had actually blocked Dongfang Hao’s attack.</p><p>“How is that possible? Lu Ming’s cultivation base was only at fourth-level void G.o.d Realm, yet he was able to block Dongfang Hao’s attack? This is too terrifying!”</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Many people were shocked, especially those who had bet on Dongfang Haosheng.</p><p>he won’t. Dongfang Hao has underestimated his enemy. He didn’t even use much of his strength just now!</p><p>“Yes, it must be like this!”</p><p>after all, Lu Ming is the number one new disciple. He’s quite powerful. I guess he’s used all his strength just now, and Dongfang Hao didn’t use much of his strength. That’s why he managed to block it!</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, it must be like this!”</p><p>Many people seemed to have found a way to ease their minds.</p><p>“This … How did this kid break through to the 4th level of the void G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Below the fighting ring, Huang Wu was the most shocked.</p><p>He had fought with Lu Ming the earliest and was very clear about Lu Ming’s previous cultivation. When Lu Ming had just entered the sect, he was only a demiG.o.d. However, he was already on fourth-level void G.o.d-level now. What kind of improvement speed was this? he was almost scared to death.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>&Nbsp; seeing Huang Wu’s expression, Huang Wen frowned and asked.</p><p>that kid’s cultivation isn’t right. It’s not right. When he first entered the sect a few years ago, he was only at the demiG.o.d realm!</p><p>Huang Wu’s mouth trembled as he spoke.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Huang Wen, as well as the others beside him, were all shocked. Their eyes were wide open.</p><p>impossible! He was only a demiG.o.d a few years ago, and now he’s already at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm. His Foundation is also solid. This is impossible, completely impossible!</p><p>One of the young men immediately shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Huang Wen asked with a dark expression.</p><p>“Of … He’s indeed a demiG.o.d! He was indeed a demiG.o.d a few years ago!”</p><p>Huang Wu said, trembling.</p><p>impossible. I don’t believe it. Perhaps, when you fought him a few years ago, he hid his cultivation. There are many secret skills that can hide cultivation in the primeval universe!</p><p>“That’s right, he must have hidden his cultivation.”</p><p>The few young men shook their heads. They did not believe Huang Wu’s words at all. They thought that Lu Ming had hidden his cultivation level in the past.</p><p>What a joke. This was virtual G.o.d-level they were talking about. It would be extremely difficult to level up. They would never believe that he could level up from demiG.o.d-level to fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level in just a few years.</p><p>Huang Wen shook his head as well. He believed that Lu Ming had hidden his cultivation level back then.</p><p>Huang Wu’s face paled, unable to speak. He was sure that his senses were not wrong.</p><p>what a monster! I hope he dies in Dongfang Hao’s hands!</p><p>Huang Wu roared in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, Dongfang Hao was also shocked.</p><p>Other people thought that he had not used his full strength, but he knew very well that in that move just now, other than the divine weapon and divine skill, he had already used 100% of his divine power.</p><p>He had planned to kill Lu Ming with one move. He had never expected that Lu Ming’s strength would be so shocking that he could block an attack with 100% of his divine power.</p><p>kid, you have some skills. Let’s see how many moves you can block!</p><p>Dongfang Hao said coldly.</p><p>cut the c.r.a.p. Show me what you’ve got. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>let’s go! Dongfang Hao reached out his hand, and a Golden Saber appeared in his palm. It looked like it was made of gold.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The battle saber shook, and the saber radiance soared into the sky.</p><p>This was a level nine low grade G.o.d equipment.</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and he took out a level nine low-grade divine artifact spear.</p><p>“Nine void slashes!”</p><p>die! Dongfang Hao roared. His body and the saber merged, and the saber radiance soared into the sky, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a divine skill!</p><p>Dongfang Hao’s second attack was a real killing move, and it was extremely powerful.</p><p>Fortunately, the life-and-death battle stage was covered with a light shield. Otherwise, Dongfang Hao’s blade light would have rushed out and all the spectators would have been enveloped by it.</p><p>“A divine skill?”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly. This was the first time he had seen someone using a divine skill in a battle.</p><p>The power of a divine skill was indeed terrifying. It was completely incomparable to an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>“Let’s try and see how powerful it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The long spear vibrated and hummed. Then, he pulled the spear out.</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the three apocalyptic strikes. Instead, he used an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>Lu Ming had already cultivated the incomplete spear technique to the seventh level, the highest level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear and the saber gleam collided. Fifteen levels of power burst out from Lu Ming’s long spear in an instant.</p><p>15 layers of power, like a stormy sea, surged towards the other.</p><p>However, Dongfang Hao’s blade ray was shockingly powerful. It kept on breaking through the layers of power.</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as the two figures quickly retreated. This time, the two of them retreated a few hundred meters before they could stabilize themselves.</p><p>“What? He blocked it again!”</p><p>how is this possible? this is impossible!</p><p>Many people couldn’t believe it. Many people rubbed their eyes, thinking that they were seeing things.</p><p>However, after rubbing, the scene was still the same, which really made them dumbfounded.</p><p>Just now, Dongfang Hao had clearly used his ultimate skill. The power was terrifying and he definitely did not hold back on purpose. However, Lu Ming had still managed to block it.</p><p>the seventh level of the incomplete divine skill! That kid has actually cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the seventh level!</p><p>“What a terrifying comprehension ability!”</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>To be able to cultivate an incomplete divine skill to the seventh level at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm was definitely shocking.</p><p>No wonder it was so powerful.</p><p>this kid is too monstrous. He must be eliminated!</p><p>Huang Wen’s eyes were extremely cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
