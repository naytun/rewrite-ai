After a fierce battle, Tong Xi’ er also defeated her opponent.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming made his move and naturally defeated his opponent easily.</p><p>People like Hu ya, Golden Sage, yang Chong, Linghu ye, and the others all easily killed their opponents without any suspense.</p><p>After the second round ended, there were five hundred people who advanced.</p><p>Then, the 500 people began the third round.</p><p>500, enter the 250th place.</p><p>Situ Feng still won this round, but Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing were defeated by their opponents and stopped here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m cultivating a cultivation technique from my past life. It’s not convenient for me to reveal too much!”</p><p>Back on the stone platform, Xie nianqing sent Lu Ming a voice transmission.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He guessed that Xie nianqing’s past life, or perhaps the current Xie nianjun, must have an extraordinary background. They didn’t dare to reveal too much. Could it be that they had a great enemy?</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>Xie nianqing wouldn’t hide anything from him, but whenever something from his previous life was mentioned, Xie nianqing was always reluctant to say more. Was it because of the great enemy?</p><p>The more Lu Ming thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s past lives must have been extraordinary.</p><p>This was because reincarnation was involved in the past and present life. Anyway, according to Lu Ming’s knowledge, no one could reincarnate.</p><p>Could a G.o.dking do that?</p><p>In the heaven realm, the sacred ancestor bloodheart had awakened from Lu Ming’s bloodline, but it was not reincarnation.</p><p>This was because the sacred ancestor bloodheart was not dead at all. He had only used a drop of his bloodline to hide in the depths of Lu Ming’s bloodline.</p><p>Also, back then, dandan did not reincarnate. Dandan was seriously injured and turned into an egg, and she was reborn.</p><p>Reincarnation was a mystery!</p><p>Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing reincarnated at the same time in their previous lives, so it was very likely that they had a great enemy.</p><p>Furthermore, their greatest enemy was most likely the greatest enemy of the entire universe.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of many things. He understood that Xie nianqing did not want to say more because he did not want to implicate him, Lu shenhuang, and the rest.</p><p>strength, my strength is too low. Little Qing, one day, I will become a Peak Master in the primeval universe and you will no longer have to worry about me!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly swore in his heart.</p><p>After Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun lost, Tong Xi ‘er went on stage.</p><p>After a difficult battle, Tong Xi ‘er barely won against her opponent.</p><p>When it was Lu Ming’s turn, he also defeated his opponent.</p><p>Golden Sage, Hu ya, and the others naturally had no suspense.</p><p>After the third round ended, there were two hundred and fifty people left.</p><p>In the fighting ring, many people moved away from yang Chong.</p><p>Yang Chong’s strength was simply too astonishing. Up until now, he had yet to unleash his full strength, and no one dared to fight him.</p><p>Liu Ming, we’ve finally met. Let’s Have a Battle!</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Suddenly, the two figures charged at each other and started fighting.</p><p>“Fight me!”</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The two of them were like a fuse, and people kept fighting each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Situ Feng fixed his eyes on Lu Ming and strode toward him, his cold killing intent locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>they’re going to fight. Lu Ming is going to fight situ Feng!</p><p>Outside, the eyes of many chaotic astral River experts brighten.</p><p>They were all from the chaotic astral River. Naturally, they would pay more attention to Lu Ming and situ Feng.</p><p>They all wanted to see who was stronger between Lu Ming and situ Feng.</p><p>Feng ‘er will definitely be able to kill Lu Ming. Together with yang Chong, we’ll be the last two to enter the top ten!</p><p>Situ haonan roared in his heart as he was filled with antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Situ Feng’s divine power surged and condensed into a combat sword. His entire person was like a dazzling sword light as he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming condensed a long spear with his ruler’s power. He swept it out and it collided with situ Feng’s combat sword.</p><p>With a violent boom, a figure retreated quickly. It was situ Feng.</p><p>“Situ Feng has retreated!”</p><p>“He is not Lu Ming’s match!”</p><p>Some people of the chaotic astral River cried out in alarm.</p><p>“How could it be like this? d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Situ haonan and Kang Ji both roared in their hearts, their faces were gloomy.</p><p>situ Feng, this is your strength. What a disappointment!</p><p>kill him! Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and charged at situ Feng at top speed.</p><p>The long spear shook, and beams of dazzling spear light enveloped situ Feng.</p><p>Situ Feng exerted all his strength and executed the incomplete divine skill at the peak of the fourth level to the extreme. However, he was still suppressed by Lu Ming and was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re indeed quite powerful. I was planning to use it last, but now, you can die!”</p><p>Situ Feng’s cold voice was heard. As soon as he finished speaking, his speed suddenly increased and he appeared behind Lu Ming in the blink of an eye. He slashed down with his sword as fast as lightning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
