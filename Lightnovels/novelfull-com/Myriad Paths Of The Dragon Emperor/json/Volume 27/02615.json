One by one, they retreated and set up a great formation, waiting for the attack.</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s name was too great!</p><p>A person who came out of a small chiliocosm under the jurisdiction of the yuanluo Palace broke free from the restraints of the yuanluo Palace and rose against the heavens. He created the righteous Army to fight against the yuanluo Palace.</p><p>More importantly, the ancestor of technique’s combat strength was extremely powerful. He had fought against two experts from the yuanluo Palace alone and established a great reputation.</p><p>Even though there was a third stage true G.o.d from the yuanluo Palace who had the same cultivation as the ancestor of technique, his face was pale and his heart was filled with fear.</p><p>He had once seen the ancestor of technique kill a stage three true G.o.d expert with a single move. He didn’t have the slightest bit of courage to face the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Kang Ji, get out here!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted coldly. His voice was so loud that many people with weak cultivation had to step back.</p><p>“Fa Ming, do you only know how to act so arrogantly in front of my subordinates?”</p><p>The voice of the palace Master of the yuanluo Palace, Kang Ji, could be heard from within the cave.</p><p>Then, with a flash, more than ten figures rushed out of the cave abode.</p><p>It was Kang Ji, situ haonan and the others.</p><p>Of course, the Grand Elder of the yuanluo Palace, mo kan, did not appear.</p><p>Kang Ji’s eyes swept around and found that only fa Ming was there. The cold light in his eyes became even thicker.</p><p>“Kang Ji, Chen jindao, originally belonged to my Righteous Army. Now, you can get lost!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said.</p><p>“Hahaha, laughable, truly laughable!”</p><p>Kang Ji laughed and looked at the ancestor of technique with a mocking expression.”Fa Ming, you’re really naïve. You’ve been in the chaotic astral River for so many years, yet you still don’t understand one thing. In the chaotic astral River, whoever is stronger will be able to occupy more and more territory. From now on, this Island, no, the entire Northern Shang planet will belong to my Yuan Luo Palace and the free and unfettered sect. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, let’s use our strength to speak!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was very direct. He stepped out, and his vast divine power burst out like a tide.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ancestor of technique’s palm pressed down. His divine power boiled and a huge palm print smashed down towards Kang Ji.</p><p>Kang Ji didn’t dare to be careless. His fourth level true G.o.d Realm divine power completely erupted. In his hand, a battle blade appeared. A blade light soared into the sky and slashed towards the technique ancestor’s palm print.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; energy shot into the sky as divine power clashed, creating shockwaves that scattered in all directions.</p><p>“Not good, block it!”</p><p>The true G.o.d Realm experts from the yuanluo Palace and the Walkabout sect all laid down layers of defense in front of them to block the shockwaves, but they were still pushed back by the shockwaves.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones spat out blood and their faces turned pale. If there were true G.o.d experts to defend, those with weaker cultivation would have been killed by the shockwaves.</p><p>There was a huge difference between the void G.o.d Realm and the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>At the same time, the blade light and the palm print dissipated. A figure continuously retreated, and the person who retreated was Kang Ji.</p><p>His cultivation was clearly at the fourth stage of true G.o.d Realm, one stage higher than the ancestor of technique. However, in a head-on battle, he was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Kang Ji, your battle strength is not good enough!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique said coldly. He activated his divine power and struck out with his palm again.</p><p>“Sun Blade technique!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! Kang Ji shouted, and his middle-grade level four G.o.d artifact battle saber emitted a dazzling Saber Light that was as dazzling as the sun.</p><p>Then, he struck out with his saber. The scorching Saber Light slashed at the ancestor of technique’s palm print.</p><p>Kang Ji displayed his G.o.dly skill!</p><p>“Fa Ming, take this!”</p><p>The leader of the free and unfettered sect, situ haonan, also made his move. His body moved like a flickering light and a pa.s.sing shadow. He was extremely fast as he rushed towards the ancestor of technique. At the same time, a soft sword appeared in his hand. The sword light was like a poisonous snake as it stabbed towards the vital parts of the ancestor of technique.</p><p>This was also a terrifying divine skill.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan both used their G.o.dly skills. The ancestor of technique’s face finally revealed a trace of seriousness. In his hand, a combat sword also appeared. The blade of the sword was a full two meters long.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ancestor of technique slashed out with his sword, and the sword light broke through the air and flashed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two violent explosions, the ancestor of technique blocked Kang Ji and situ haonan’s attacks.</p><p>“Fa Ming, since you dared to come here alone today, you can stay here forever!”</p><p>Kang Ji continuously used his Shen power and used his Shen technique to the extreme. The power was extremely terrifying as he attacked.</p><p>At the same time, situ haonan’s body flickered and moved around at an extremely fast speed, taking the opportunity to attack the ancestor of technique’s weakness.</p><p>With the two of them working together, their power increased sharply.</p><p>The ancestor of technique focused his attention and fought one against two, and it was difficult to tell who was winning.</p><p>The three of them fought on the sea, creating huge waves, and then fought in the sky.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the three of them had exchanged hundreds of moves, and it was difficult to determine the winner. At this time, the three of them were fighting on the sea again.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the surface of the sea churned, and a terrifying destructive light burst out from the sea and attacked the ancestor of technique.</p><p>“Mo kan!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique shouted angrily.</p><p>“Haha, fa Ming, die!”</p><p>Kang Ji laughed and launched a violent attack.</p><p>Situ haonan also burst out with full power attacks, coordinating with mo kan’s sneak attack.</p><p>Just as the ancestor of technique was about to be hit, suddenly, the sword light on his body expanded and shot out in all directions.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan, and Mo kan’s attacks were all blocked by the sword light that filled the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Wuwuwuwu …</p><p>Kang Ji, situ haonan and Mo kan retreated quickly. They stood in the air and looked at the ancestor of technique in shock.</p><p>“Fa Ming, you … You’ve reached the third level of your divine skill?”</p><p>Kang Ji roared in shock.</p><p>A divine skill was naturally an attack of the martial G.o.d Realm. It could exert the power of divine power to the extreme and burst out with terrifying power. It had the same meaning as martial skills.</p><p>According to the different power and the different degree of profoundness, divine skills were also divided into different levels.</p><p>However, the division of Shen skills was completely related to the level of mystery.</p><p>For example, a divine skill only had one level. Even if it was cultivated to the peak, there would only be one level, and that would be a divine skill of the first level.</p><p>Some divine skills, when cultivated to the peak, had two levels, and that would be two divine skills.</p><p>Two divine skills were naturally more powerful and terrifying than one.</p><p>Some divine skills, when cultivated to the peak, would have three levels, and would become three levels of divine skills.</p><p>The more levels a divine skill had, the greater its potential and the higher its value.</p><p>Of course, the cultivation of a Shen technique is very profound and complicated. Even if you have it, you might not be able to cultivate it to the highest level.</p><p>For example, if a person’s talent was limited and he had a triple-layer divine skill, but could only cultivate it to the first layer, then the power would be no different from that of a first-layer divine skill.</p><p>The more profound it was, the more levels it would have.</p><p>There were fourth, fifth, sixth, and even ninth and tenth levels.</p><p>The minimum requirement to cultivate a divine skill was to be at peak void G.o.d-level, because it consumed a lot of divine power to use divine-level.</p><p>Without great divine power, it could not be sustained at all.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan both have a triple-stage spirit technique, but they’ve only cultivated it to the second stage.</p><p>The ancestor of technique also had a triple divine skill, but he had already cultivated it to the third level!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
