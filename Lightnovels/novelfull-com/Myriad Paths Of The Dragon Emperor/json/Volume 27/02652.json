It would be useless even if they spoke.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming. They were all guessing which Overlord force Lu Ming would choose to join.</p><p>However, Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>Since he had already promised the ancestor of technique that he would join the Kong Xuan sect, he would not change his mind.</p><p>Moreover, the Kong Xuan sect was ranked first among the top ten sects. Even if it was not as good as the three overlords, it was not too far behind.</p><p>“He actually didn’t choose?”</p><p>he’s probably hesitating about which of the three overlords to choose. If it were me, I’d also be hesitating!</p><p>“You can stop dreaming!”</p><p>Most people thought that Lu Ming was at a loss as to which Overlord force to choose.</p><p>“Lu Ming, as long as you join the indestructible sword sect, with your talent, I’m sure some Big Shot will take you in as a disciple. You’ll have to consider it carefully!”</p><p>The expert from the eternal sword sect spoke again.</p><p>“Nonsense, isn’t it normal for such a talent to be noticed by a strong person? Lu Ming, I can see that your fighting style is very similar to that of our unique devil Academy. Joining our unique devil Academy is your best choice!”</p><p>pfft! Your unique demon Academy is really shameless. How could you say that our fighting styles are similar? Lu Ming, the boundless Holy Land is your best choice!</p><p>The compet.i.tion had started to escalate. The experts of the three Overlord forces had already started to curse.</p><p>“Seniors!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly opened his mouth and cupped his fists at the powerhouses from the three Overlord forces. Lu Ming is grateful for everyone’s love. However, I’m afraid that he can’t join the immortal sword sect, the unique demon Academy, or the boundless Holy Land!</p><p>What?</p><p>As soon as these words came out, everyone was shocked and the scene was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually rejected the invitations of the three Overlord forces at the same time?</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>The three Overlord forces were the strongest in the Qin heaven Star Zone, with the exception of a few ancient clans. Many people had tried their best to squeeze in but could not. Lu Ming had actually rejected them?</p><p>Most of the people were shocked.</p><p>As for Kang Ji and situ haonan, they were ecstatic.</p><p>hahaha, this kid, to think that he’s so talented. Turns out he’s just an idiot. He actually rejected the three Overlord forces!</p><p>idiot, what an idiot! Not only will he not be able to join the three Overlord forces, but he will also offend the experts of the three Overlord forces!</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan laughed madly in their hearts. They were simply overjoyed.</p><p>“Am I right or wrong?”</p><p>The ancestor of technique sighed in his heart. He was filled with guilt toward Lu Ming.</p><p>If it were not for his request, Lu Ming would most likely choose to join the three Overlord forces.</p><p>As expected, the experts of the three Overlord forces all revealed unhappy expressions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better consider it carefully!”</p><p>“That’s right, think carefully before you speak!”</p><p>The cultivators from the three Overlord forces spoke one after another.</p><p>“Seniors, Lu Ming can only thank everyone for their love!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and refused again.</p><p>The faces of the experts from the three Overlord forces darkened.</p><p>“Hmph, you don’t know your place!”</p><p>“You’re so stubborn!”</p><p>Displeased voices came from the experts of the three overlords.</p><p>If Lu Ming had chosen one of the three Overlord forces, it would have been fine. Now that Lu Ming and the other two had rejected him together, they were embarra.s.sed.</p><p>The experts of the top ten sects were ecstatic.</p><p>That was because they had a chance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the Kong Xuan sect sincerely invites you to join us!”</p><p>“My multi-story building sect welcomes you!”</p><p>my flying snow sect is sincerely inviting you …</p><p>The top ten sects all invited Lu Ming to join them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the powerhouses from the top ten sects and finally landed on the powerhouses from the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming, and I’m willing to join the Kong Xuan sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“He’s joined the Kong Xuan sect!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>But more people were puzzled.</p><p>Why did Lu Ming choose to join the Kong Xuan sect instead of the three Chiefs?</p><p>Although the Kong Xuan sect was ranked first among the top ten sects, it was still not as good as the three overlords.</p><p>Instead of the three Overlord forces, he chose the Kong Xuan sect?</p><p>perhaps, he’s an old friend of the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>Many people guessed this.</p><p>The powerhouses of Kong Xuan sect were overjoyed.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming would choose the Kong Xuan sect in the end.</p><p>“Good, good, good, come, come here!”</p><p>The powerhouses from Kong Xuan sect nodded repeatedly and were overjoyed.</p><p>senior, I have a request. A few of my friends would like to join the Kong Xuan sect. Please fulfill my request!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Friends, no problem. Who are you?”</p><p>The powerhouse from the Kong Xuan sect said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er.</p><p>Xie nianqing stepped forward and stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Junior is willing to join the Kong Xuan sect!” Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s eyes flickered as he stepped forward and came to Lu Ming’s side. However, he did not say anything.</p><p>“Alright, sure, of course!”</p><p>The powerhouse from Kong Xuan sect nodded.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s performance just now was also very good, so he naturally wouldn’t disagree.</p><p>Lu Ming, I would like to join the Golden pool sect, one of the top ten sects. The divine power I cultivate is more suitable for the Golden pool sect!</p><p>At this moment, Tong Xi ‘er sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He naturally respected Tong Xi ‘er’s choice.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun arrived at the Kong Xuan sect’s District.</p><p>“Linghu ye, the inextinguishable sword sect would like to invite you to join us!”</p><p>“My unique devil Academy …”</p><p>“The boundless Holy Land …”</p><p>Then, the three Overlord forces started to invite Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye’s comprehension was also very high. Although his divine power was still weak, he was still very important to them and they all sent out invitations.</p><p>“I’ll join the eternal sword sect!”</p><p>Linghu ye spoke, choosing the inextinguishable sword sect. The experts of the inextinguishable sword sect were overjoyed.</p><p>alright. As long as you cultivate well, I guarantee that you’ll be able to trample Lu Ming under your feet in a thousand years!</p><p>The expert from the inextinguishable sword sect said, casting Lu Ming an unhappy glance.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not say a word.</p><p>“It’s too early to say that now!”</p><p>The powerhouse from the Kong Xuan sect replied coldly.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming was a member of the Kong Xuan sect, it was only natural that the powerhouses of the Kong Xuan sect would protect him.</p><p>Moreover, although the Kong Xuan sect was not as powerful as the immortal sword sect, they were not afraid.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
