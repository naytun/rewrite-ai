You’re all demons!</p><p>you recklessly killed your fellow disciples. You’ve violated the sect rules. You’ll be punished!</p><p>The remaining people shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Previously, these people had threatened to kill them and Lu Ming and the rest had almost died at their hands.</p><p>Now, he wanted to use the sect rules to pressure them. Where did the sect rules go when they were chasing after Lu Ming and the rest?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming showed no mercy. He waved his long spear and sent a seventh level void G.o.d Realm expert flying. He was severely injured and on the verge of death.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, there were only six or seven people left from the 30-odd people. They were all at the 7th level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Let’s split up and escape!”</p><p>The young man with the big bow shouted in horror and shot an arrow at Lu Ming. An arrow was shot at Lu Ming but was flicked away by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. At that moment, a powerful force suddenly burst out from his body.</p><p>The ‘battle formula’ tripled his combat power and was successfully triggered. This caused Lu Ming’s abilities to soar again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure burst out and thrust his spear. A seventh level void G.o.d Realm youth was shocked and tried his best to block it. However, how could he block it? he was directly penetrated by Lu Ming’s spear. Then, the spear trembled and the person was torn to pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took advantage of the situation and killed another seventh-level void G.o.d-level youth.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had killed another person each.</p><p>The other party only had three people left.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming rapidly approached the young man with the large bow.</p><p>The young man with the large bow was almost scared to death. He kept drawing the bow and shot arrows at Lu Ming, but they were easily deflected by Lu Ming.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming threw the long spear.</p><p>The level nine low-grade divine artifact level spear turned into a bolt of lightning and pierced through the bow-wielding youth, nailing him to an ancient tree.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The other party was not dead yet, and he let out a shrill scream.</p><p>Lu Ming, go ahead and kill him. The transient light Holy Son will avenge me. Your strength is not worth mentioning in the eyes of the transient light Holy Son. No, any expert from my transient light Faction can kill you and your woman!</p><p>The young man with the bow knew that he was going to die, so he cursed madly before he died.</p><p>if that sacred son of reflection offends me, I’ll kill him sooner or later. Rest in peace!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He struck out with his palm and killed the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled out the long spear and returned to the original battlefield.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had caught up with the remaining two young men and killed them in no time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and appeared beside a young man. This young man was the one in luxurious clothes.</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes was the first to attack Lu Ming. He was severely injured by Lu Ming’s spear and half of his body was broken. He lay on the ground, unable to move. He had witnessed the entire scene just now.</p><p>At this moment, he was so scared that he peed his pants.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming, Lu Ming was just a demiG.o.d ant and he did not take him seriously at all. He had never expected Lu Ming to be so terrifying.</p><p>don’t kill me, don’t kill me. As long as you spare my dog life, I’ll obey your every order from now on. I’ll be your dog. Please spare me!</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes shouted in fear.</p><p>I don’t need a dog. You can go in peace!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He swung his spear and ended the person.</p><p>“Let’s hurry and leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said after collecting everyone’s storage rings.</p><p>There was a huge commotion here just now. If the others found out that Lu Ming and the rest had killed more than thirty disciples, they would definitely be in trouble.</p><p>Their figures flashed and they left the place.</p><p>A moment after Lu Ming and the rest disappeared, a rainbow light flashed in the sky and a figure appeared.</p><p>This figure was the outer sect Deacon, le Zhong.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Le Zhong’s eyes widened in disbelief when he saw the corpses all over the ground.</p><p>“What’s going on? This wound was a sword wound and a gunshot wound. He was killed by someone. Who was it? Who is it?”</p><p>Le Zhong roared, his eyes extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Could it be Lu Ming, that kid?”</p><p>He thought of Lu Ming in his joy.</p><p>That was because the young man in luxurious clothes and the rest had been waiting here all along to block Lu Ming. He knew all of this.</p><p>However, were Lu Ming and the few of them that powerful?</p><p>“d.a.m.ned b * stard, I won’t let this matter rest!”</p><p>Le Zhong gave a low growl, and in a flash, he left the place.</p><p>……</p><p>The days that followed were rather peaceful. With QiuQiu’s help, Lu Ming and the rest obtained many wood crystals in the forest.</p><p>Although it couldn’t be compared to the abyss, it was still pretty good.</p><p>The three-month period was almost up. Lu Ming and the other two headed out of the forest.</p><p>In the forest, figures kept rushing out and came to the outside of the forest.</p><p>Outside, the outer sect elder stood in the air. It was obvious that he had been waiting here.</p><p>“Haha, how’s your harvest this time?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>“Nest, you’ve actually broken through one level!”</p><p>Many people met and chatted with each other.</p><p>Many people had a smile on their faces. This time, most of them had a good harvest.</p><p>Killing plant life forms and obtaining wood crystals could quickly increase one’s cultivation.</p><p>There were even many people who directly broke through one level of cultivation, which saved many years of time.</p><p>Not long after, almost all the disciples who went in came out.</p><p>However, the number of people was much smaller.</p><p>When they entered, there were more than 600 people, but now, there were only about 500 people. There were about 100 fewer people.</p><p>It was obvious that these people had all fallen in the forest and become nutrients for the plant life.</p><p>At this moment, four rainbow lights flew out from the forest.</p><p>It was the four outer sect deacons. They were the rear guards and had just come out.</p><p>As soon as le Zhong came out, his gaze swept toward Lu Ming. A powerful aura suddenly pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he had been crushed by a divine mountain. His body trembled violently and he retreated continuously. A stream of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted and stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The others, including the outer sect elders and the three outer sect deacons, also looked at le Zhong in surprise.</p><p>brat, you’ve harmed your fellow disciples with such ruthless methods. Today, I’ll clean up my sect and kill you!</p><p>He shouted in joy and his killing intent was cold. Without any explanation, he threw a palm at Lu Ming, not giving him a chance to defend himself.</p><p>A terrifying palm print pressed toward Lu Ming, causing his expression to change drastically.</p><p>Le Zhong’s cultivation had definitely reached true G.o.d-level, and he might even be an advanced true G.o.d. It was too terrifying. Lu Ming could not resist at all. The difference in cultivation was too great. It was not something that talent could make up for.</p><p>However, at this moment, a force came from the side and blocked le Zhong’s attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
