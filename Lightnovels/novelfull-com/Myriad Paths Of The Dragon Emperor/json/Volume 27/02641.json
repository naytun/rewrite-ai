I have to cultivate to a higher level!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>To be honest, he was still under a bit of pressure for this a.s.sessment.</p><p>It would not be easy to get first place without exposing his ruler’s power.</p><p>The Golden Saint, Hu ya, and yang Chong were all existences who could control divine grade divine power, and their comprehension abilities were definitely not low.</p><p>It would not be easy to defeat them.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too low.</p><p>Hu ya and the others were all suppressed to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a seven-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Since he could not use the ‘battle formula’, Lu Ming did not have much of an advantage.</p><p>After all, the power of the divine power was extremely powerful.</p><p>Therefore, if he wanted to defeat his opponent with a lower cultivation base, an incomplete divine skill was of utmost importance.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cultivate.</p><p>Time pa.s.sed day by day.</p><p>One day, a figure suddenly appeared in s.p.a.ce outside myriad spirit planet.</p><p>This figure was a beautiful middle-aged woman. She looked to be in her forties, but she still had her charm.</p><p>She stopped in s.p.a.ce and looked at planet thousand spirits.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be a member of my clan in the Qin heaven star system. It seems that he hasn’t reached adulthood yet. He should be a descendant of one of my clan members who has been stranded outside!</p><p>our race is originally small in number. Since we’ve encountered them, we’ll bring them back and nurture them well!</p><p>After saying that, the beautiful middle-aged woman took a step forward. The next moment, she appeared on a Street in Wanling city. Her speed was so fast that it was unbelievable.</p><p>Moreover, no one on the street seemed to have noticed how the beautiful middle-aged woman had appeared. It was as if she had been there all along.</p><p>Among these people, there were heavenly G.o.d-level existences.</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman’s gaze landed on an Inn. This Inn was the one where Lu Ming and the others were staying.</p><p>The next moment, she took another step and appeared in a room.</p><p>This room was bubble’s cultivation place.</p><p>Bubbles had been following Lu Ming here and was cultivating in this room.</p><p>Bubbles had been cultivating with her eyes closed. Suddenly, she sensed something and opened her eyes. She saw the beautiful middle-aged woman standing in front of her, sizing her up curiously.</p><p>Paoba was given a huge shock as she stood up and wanted to escape.</p><p>However, she realized that she couldn’t move. She was confined in the air.</p><p>she has excellent talent and is a top-grade unpolished jade. If she is sculpted, she will definitely be dazzling!</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman sized up the bubble carefully. The more she looked at it, the more satisfied she was.</p><p>“You … Who are you? Why do I feel so close to him?”</p><p>Pao Pao blinked her eyes and said. Right now, she was no longer afraid. Instead, she could feel a sense of familiarity from this beautiful middle-aged lady.</p><p>“You and I are of the same race, so we naturally have a sense of familiarity!”</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman smiled and then her figure changed rapidly. The next moment, a s.p.a.ce-time spirit mouse appeared in the air.</p><p>s.p.a.ce-time spirit mouse!</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman was also a s.p.a.ce-time spirit mouse!</p><p>“You, you …”</p><p>Bubbles blinked her eyes hard.</p><p>This was the first time she had seen other s.p.a.ce-time spirit rats, and she felt closer to them.</p><p>little fellow, you’ve probably never returned to the clan before, right? now, I’ll bring you back to the clan. That’s the place you should stay. Only then can your talent truly be displayed!</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman said as she transformed back into her human form.</p><p>“Return to your race with you? I, I …”</p><p>Paoba muttered.</p><p>To be honest, she really wanted to follow the middle-aged woman to the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat clan and meet other members of the same clan.</p><p>However, she could not bear to part with Lu Ming!</p><p>I want to say goodbye to brother Lu Ming before I can leave with you!</p><p>Finally, bubbles gritted her teeth.</p><p>Although she could not bear to part with Lu Ming, she realized that her current cultivation level was too low. She could not help Lu Ming at all. Even dandan’s cultivation level had surpa.s.sed hers.</p><p>Therefore, she decided to return to the clan with the middle-aged woman first to improve her strength before coming out.</p><p>“Farewell, that’s easy!”</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman revealed a happy expression and swept her gaze over the crowd.</p><p>eh? there’s a world divine turtle here. My clan and the world divine turtle have a deep relationship. Why don’t we bring this world divine turtle to the world divine Turtle Clan …</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman muttered. Then, she waved her hand and brought bubbles to dandan’s room.</p><p>At this moment, a Jade card was floating above dandan’s head, and she was cultivating an incomplete divine skill in the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman said. The light on the Jade tablet above dandan’s head dimmed, and he woke up.</p><p>“Nest, what happened? I’m cultivating right now …”</p><p>As soon as dandan woke up, she let out a strange cry, and then immediately saw the middle-aged beautiful woman.</p><p>The moment he saw the middle-aged lady, dandan’s hair stood on end. He wanted to retreat immediately but, just like bubbles, he realized that he could not move at all.</p><p>“Dandan, it’s like this, this is a senior of my clan …”</p><p>Bubbles introduced the beautiful middle-aged lady.</p><p>it turns out to be a senior of the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat clan …</p><p>Dandan’s heart moved.</p><p>little guy, you’re not young anymore. You must have learned a lot from your bloodline inheritance. In the primeval universe, the World Turtle and the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat are quite related. Are you willing to come with me? I’ll take you back to the world Turtle Clan!</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman said.</p><p>I’m willing, of course I’m willing. I, no, I’m 10000 times willing to do it!</p><p>Dandan immediately agreed and nodded quickly.</p><p>How could he not be willing? as long as he could return to the divine Turtle Clan of the world, he would be able to improve even faster. Why would he need to join the Qin heavenly thirteen clans?</p><p>“Dandan, I want to say goodbye to brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pao Pao said.</p><p>that’s good. Say goodbye to that guy!</p><p>Dandan nodded.</p><p>Then, the middle-aged lady brought the two of them to Lu Ming’s room. A voice was heard, and Lu Ming woke up.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also a little dumbfounded. He was fighting with the dire beasts and suddenly left the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>“You are …”</p><p>At the sight of the middle-aged lady, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed as thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>Could it be that this person had asked him to leave the dream s.p.a.ce?</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, this is a senior from my clan!”</p><p>Pao Pao pulled Lu Ming’s arm and said.</p><p>a senior of the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat clan …</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had heard the ancestral Dragon mention it before.</p><p>A few of the top ten Battle Beasts in the heaven realm were not native to the heaven realm, but came from the desolate universe.</p><p>The World Turtle, the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat, and the Saint spirit ant all came from the primal universe.</p><p>Could it be that the person in front of him was a senior of the s.p.a.ce-time spirit rat clan in the primal universe?</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s like this …”</p><p>Dandan explained that they were going to return to the clan with the beautiful middle-aged woman.</p><p>“This is a good thing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He naturally would not object.</p><p>Only by returning to the clan with the beautiful middle-aged woman would they have a better future.</p><p>Following him would instead bury one’s talent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
