You will do whatever I tell you to do, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly narrowed and his face darkened.</p><p>The meaning behind Dragon Boat Mountain’s words was clear. They would nurture Lu Ming in the future. However, Lu Ming had to listen to their every word. This was no different from becoming a tool for Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>The other party wanted to use him as a knife to achieve some kind of goal.</p><p>How could Lu Ming agree?</p><p>“Sect master, I swear on my life source that there’s no need to do so. You’re the sect master. If there’s anything that you need Lu Ming’s help with in the future, he’ll definitely do his best!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Are you rejecting me?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s expression turned cold, and a dangerous light flickered in his eyes.</p><p>“I swear on my life source. Please forgive Lu Ming for not being able to agree to this!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a determined expression.</p><p>Once he swore on his life source, Lu Ming would at the very least become the Dragon boat’s puppet in the future. He would not be able to act on his own.</p><p>“Unable to agree? Today, you have to agree even if you don’t want to. If you can’t be used by me, I’d rather destroy you!”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain’s expression turned even gloomier, and his tone was frosty. A wave of terrifying killing intent enveloped Lu Ming, causing him to shiver.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect to be so despicable.</p><p>Once they knew that he could control divine-grade divine power, they wanted to control him.</p><p>as the master of a sect, he actually threatened his disciples like this. If this were to spread out, I don’t know how many people would be bitterly disappointed!</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed the anger in his heart.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said coldly.</p><p>I’m telling the truth. If you want to kill me today, just do it. You want me to swear? dream on!</p><p>Lu Ming confronted him without any fear.</p><p>Although he didn’t want to die, he would rather die than be the other party’s puppet.</p><p>hehehe, you have a backbone and aren’t afraid of death. But do you think it’s useful to be unafraid of death? you think I can’t deal with you if you don’t swear? how naive. I’ll plant the dark Dragon blood Curse on you and make you wish you were dead!</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain roared and grabbed at the air. Lu Ming felt a powerful force grabbing at him. He could not resist at all and was caught in the Dragon boat’s hands.</p><p>Then, the fingers on the Dragon Boat pointed out continuously. One after another, terrifying rune arcs slithered into Lu Ming’s body like blood-red Vipers.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a beast-like roar because it was too painful. At this moment, Lu Ming’s body felt as if it was being bitten by countless small snakes. It was extremely uncomfortable and painful.</p><p>“Hehe, haha, enjoy my Dark Dragon blood Curse!”</p><p>The Dragon boats sneered continuously. They waved their fingers faster and faster, and more blood-red runes burrowed into Lu Ming’s body, intertwining to form a terrifying array.</p><p>old man, you old man who won’t die, you are despicable and shameless …</p><p>Lu Ming cursed in pain.</p><p>“Curse all you want, I’ll let you curse all you want!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain sneered.</p><p>you old fart, how dare you call yourself the leader of a sect? you’re shameless, perverted, and utterly devoid of conscience. Your son doesn’t have an a.n.u.s. You’re impotent at night. Bai Tianyang, f * ck …</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth did not stop. He was shooting like a machine gun.</p><p>After hanging out with dandan for so long, it was not for nothing.</p><p>Even though Dragon Boat Mountain’s will was firm, he was scolded to the point that his eyelids kept twitching.</p><p>After a short while, the Dragon Boat Mountain finally stopped moving. The dark Dragon blood Curse had already been laid down.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body emitted a piercing red light. It was like countless small snakes that wrapped around his body, causing him to suffer endless pain.</p><p>This pain was worse than being cut into pieces.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming did not even have the strength to curse. He fell to the ground and panted heavily.</p><p>“Now you know how powerful I am!”</p><p>The Dragon boats sneered. With a wave of their hands, the runes on Lu Ming’s body, which were like Vipers, disappeared. The pain on Lu Ming’s body also disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming looked into his body and realized that the runes that were like poisonous snakes had disappeared without a trace. He could not detect them at all.</p><p>the dark Dragon blood Curse has been hidden deep in your body. As long as I think about it, you will be in extreme pain and even die instantly. Now, your life and death are completely in my hands. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said coldly.</p><p>“You’re really despicable. Tell me, what do you want me to do?”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>He planned to calm the old man down first, then think of a way to get rid of the dark Dragon blood Curse in his body.</p><p>there’s no rush. Your cultivation is still too weak now. When your cultivation improves, I’ll naturally need you!</p><p>remember, you’d better be obedient. Otherwise, I’ll make you disappear completely!</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said coldly. He then took out a golden token and threw it to Lu Ming.</p><p>this is a gold token, the highest-quality token in the Kong Xuan sect. With this token, other than some restricted areas, you can enter anywhere you want in the Kong Xuan sect. You can also enter some cultivation sacred grounds. Cultivate well!</p><p>With that, the Dragon Boat Mountain waved its hand and Lu Ming was pushed out by a force.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely cold. The other party naturally did not have good intentions when they gave him the gold token. They only hoped that he would improve as soon as possible and be of use to him in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his head and pondered for a moment. He kept the gold token and walked out. Not long after, he saw Huo Quan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how is it? What did the sect master say to you? With a talent like yours, the sect master will probably put in a lot of effort to cultivate you!”</p><p>Huo Quan said with a smile.</p><p>His smile was very clean, as if he didn’t know anything.</p><p>“This Huo Quan, doesn’t he know how despicable the Dragon Boat Mountain is?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He nodded casually and said, ” “It’s alright!”</p><p>“I’ll send you back!”</p><p>Huo Quan said. He then brought Lu Ming out of the inner sect area and returned to the outer sect area.</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming immediately went into seclusion. He circulated the universe thousand Dao art with all his might. The Dominator’s divine power seeped into every part of his body and swam through every inch of his muscles, bones, and even his internal organs. He wanted to find the dark Dragon blood Curse and destroy it.</p><p>However, after using his ruler’s divine power to make a full circle, he found nothing.</p><p>“That old man, since he knows that I have control over the ruler’s divine power, he definitely knows that I can’t destroy the dark Dragon blood Curse with the ruler’s divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>He had not expected the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect to be such a despicable, cunning, and shameless person.</p><p>for now, I can only play along and calm the other party down. I’ll find a way to break the dark Dragon blood Curse in the future. I, Lu Ming, will remember this grudge today!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p>He had been through countless storms and waves on his way here. He didn’t believe that he wouldn’t be able to overcome this obstacle.</p><p>Lu Ming then took out the gold token.</p><p>since you want to cultivate me well, then I’ll borrow your strength to improve my strength first!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Then, he left the outer gate area and headed toward the inner gate.</p><p>There were many cultivation sanctuaries in the inner sect. With this golden token, Lu Ming could use those cultivation sanctuaries to cultivate and improve his strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
