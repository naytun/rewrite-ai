Lu Ming could not avoid this attack and was about to be hit.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger said ferociously, as if it could already see ten million divine gems waving at it.</p><p>“Defeated? You’re the one who’s defeated!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. Then, his body emitted a red light and a red-gold armor appeared on the surface of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>It was the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. Lu Ming had deliberately revealed that flaw.</p><p>Lu Ming did not cultivate any speed-type divine skill. He could not keep up with the Scorpion Tiger’s speed by relying on the incomplete ROC wings technique. If he wanted to defeat the Scorpion Tiger, he had to lure it closer. Only then would he have a chance.</p><p>Therefore, he deliberately revealed a flaw. The Scorpion Tiger was fooled and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger’s combat sword stabbed the Scarlet Gold armor, making an ear-piercing sound. Sparks flew in all directions, and the Scarlet Gold armor trembled continuously. However, in the end, the Scorpion Tiger’s attack was blocked.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming had only cultivated the first stage of the nine stage Crimson Gold armor. At the peak of the first stage, he was afraid that he would not be able to withstand the other party’s attacks.</p><p>However, Jing Yu had obtained the [ ninefold Crimson Gold armor ] from his painting, and it was also incredibly profound, not inferior to the [ three apocalyptic strikes ]. With the support of the ruler’s divine power, its defensive power was astonishing, allowing it to successfully block the Scorpion Tiger’s attack.</p><p>“How could it be!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger was shocked that its attack had failed to break through Lu Ming’s defense. It wanted to retreat, but it was too late. Lu Ming would not give it such a chance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A long spear swept towards the Scorpion Tiger at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger was. .h.i.t right on the head. It let out a blood-curdling screech as its body flew out like a broken sack. It crashed heavily on the fighting ring and slid a few thousand meters away.</p><p>His body had almost exploded into two, and he was severely injured.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and he thrust his long spear forward, stopping right in front of the Scorpion Tiger’s glabella.</p><p>“Don’t kill me!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger roared and broke out in a cold sweat. It only reacted after it had shouted. They were not in a life-and-death battle and Lu Ming could not kill it.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. With a shake of his long spear, a stream of energy gushed out and sent the Scorpion Tiger flying out of the fighting ring.</p><p>The scene was in an uproar.</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger had actually lost.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite who was ranked 51st on the virtual G.o.d ranking list had been defeated by Lu Ming, a disciple who had just joined the sect. This was extremely rare in the history of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>This level of combat strength was too terrifying.</p><p>a defensive skill at the fourth level of the ethereal G.o.d Realm. Not only did he cultivate an offensive skill, but he also cultivated a defensive skill. What kind of monstrous comprehension is this? ”</p><p>is he still a new disciple? his combat strength is way too strong. Today, he has defeated three geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking list!</p><p>from now on, Dongfang Hao will fall from the virtual G.o.d ranking while Lu Ming will be ranked 51st on the virtual G.o.d ranking!</p><p>These words made many people look at each other.</p><p>An existence at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm was ranked 51st on the void G.o.d ranking. This had never happened in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>In the midst of the laughter, Huang Wen and the others were so shocked that they couldn’t speak. Then, a cold killing intent gushed out from their hearts.</p><p>The more powerful Lu Ming was, the greater the threat he posed to them and the more they had to get rid of him.</p><p>“Haha, the future generations are truly fearsome!”</p><p>One of the law enforcement elders laughed and handed the ten million divine crystals and the divine skill to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had earned a huge sum of money again. Many people were green with envy.</p><p>“Who else, come up and fight!”</p><p>After Lu Ming put away his spoils of war, he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The entire place fell silent. No one spoke.</p><p>The geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking list shut their mouths. What a joke. If Scorpion Tiger lost, they would definitely lose if they went up.</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few times but no one went up.</p><p>That was because none of the top 50 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list had come.</p><p>These people were either out for training, on missions, or cultivating in seclusion. Some of them would not have come to watch the life-and-death battle between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao even if they had known about it.</p><p>Dongfang Hao, a new disciple, was not enough to pique their curiosity.</p><p>Therefore, no one dared to fight now.</p><p>“Since no one wants to fight, then let’s leave today’s matter at that!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the spear. He thanked the three law enforcement elders and turned into a ray of light, leaving the place.</p><p>A group of people were left behind, gritting their teeth.</p><p>Lu Ming did not return to his residence. Instead, he flew straight to the inner sect area. It was no longer safe to stay in the outer sect area. He would definitely be targeted. Therefore, Lu Ming decided to come to the inner sect area.</p><p>Lu Ming took out ten million divine crystals and exchanged them for ten thousand points when he arrived at the inner gate area. He then entered the divine pulse tower.</p><p>In the divine pulse tower, Lu Ming sat cross-legged, absorbing the divine Qi from the outer sect to recover his divine energy.</p><p>The divine energy here was very rich. Not long after, Lu Ming had recovered to his peak state.</p><p>After he recovered to his peak state, Lu Ming waved his hand and a scroll appeared.</p><p>This scroll was the king-grade wondrous technique that Lu Ming had obtained from Huang Chengan.</p><p>Lu Ming opened it and took a look.</p><p>“Divine ice formula!”</p><p>When he opened it, he saw the name of this wondrous technique.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look.</p><p>This was a very ordinary King-grade divine skill. It had seven levels in total, and when one cultivated to the seventh level, one would be able to cultivate the king-grade divine power, the ice divine power.</p><p>The ice divine power was one of the more common ones among King-grade divine powers.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care. As long as it was King-grade divine power, it would be useful to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately started to study it carefully.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming began to cultivate.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the divine pulse tower for half a month.</p><p>For half a month, Lu Ming had been comprehending and cultivating the divine ice formula.</p><p>After half a month of cultivation, Lu Ming had finally cultivated a trace of the divine ice power.</p><p>&Nbsp; a wisp of ice divine power mixed with the ruler divine power flowed through his meridians.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He immediately gave up on circulating the divine ice formula and began to circulate the universe thousand Dao formula. The wisp of divine ice power completely fused with the ruler’s strength in an instant and became one.</p><p>A few more days pa.s.sed. In Lu Ming’s dantian, a spot of light suddenly lit up near the divine fire.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, the light became brighter and brighter. Slowly, it became a wisp of divine fire.</p><p>Another divine flame appeared. This was the second divine flame.</p><p>Two divine flames had actually appeared in a person’s dantian. If this was known by others, they would be scared to death.</p><p>According to the general knowledge of cultivation in the prehistoric universe, one person could only light up one divine fire. It was absolutely impossible to light up a second divine fire. However, Lu Ming had done it.</p><p>he really ignited the second divine fire. This universe thousand Dao art is really amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>Jing Yu had obtained the universal Dao incantation from a Heritage Site, and even he didn’t know its origins.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
