It was extremely bright and fast.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The body of the young man from the Tiger Tribe suddenly froze in mid-air. This was because the s.p.a.ce between his eyebrows had been pierced by Lu Ming’s spear gleam and he had died on the spot.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the body of the Tiger youth exploded with a bang and dissipated into energy.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Hu Mao and the others were all shocked.</p><p>This was completely beyond their expectations.</p><p>A mere transformation void martial artist from the chaotic astral River had actually killed a heaven’s pride expert of the Tiger clan with a single move.</p><p>After the shock, it was anger.</p><p>brat, you dare to kill the people of my Tiger clan? you’re courting death!</p><p>The Tiger roared.</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He clenched his fist and a long spear was formed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath and attacked directly. In an instant, a few terrifying spearlights burst out and killed the few Tiger clan youths.</p><p>“Attack, attack together! I want him to suffer a fate worse than death!”</p><p>The Tiger roared.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The young men of the Tiger clan roared like tigers and their divine power condensed into all kinds of weapons that charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and the long spear trembled. Seven changes appeared instantly and the Spear’s radiance was thrust out. Each of the Spear’s radiance contained seven levels of power.</p><p>These Tigermen youths could not withstand it at all.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Some of them were pierced through the glabella by the spear radiance, while others were swept by the long spear and directly split open.</p><p>The twenty or so Tigermen youths were like babies in Lu Ming’s hands. They could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>Not all of these people controlled ordinary divine power. There were a few who controlled King grade divine power.</p><p>It was a pity that his understanding of the incomplete divine skill was so-so that it could not even withstand a single blow from Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tigermen tribe had many experts. Other than peerless geniuses like Hu ya, there were also some other top experts.</p><p>For example, tiger bone, one of the top three masters in the Dongcheng Area, was one of them.</p><p>If Lu Ming stayed here, he might collide with the Tiger bones.</p><p>In the next few days, the Tigermen tribe did not appear.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming’s cultivation attracted the attention of some other experts who wanted to kill him. However, they were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ranking had increased a little. He was close to the 200th place.</p><p>For nine consecutive days, Lu Ming had attracted more than ten young men and they all died at his hands.</p><p>Lu Ming’s reputation spread like this.</p><p>In the Dongcheng Area District, everyone placed Lu Ming on the same level as the other three top experts.</p><p>The news of Lu Ming’s battle with the Tigermen tribe spread and attracted many people to watch.</p><p>There were many young experts hiding in the hidden corners of some buildings in the area. They were looking at Lu Ming from afar.</p><p>They were waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>If Lu Ming really fought with the Tigermen tribe and both sides were injured, they would have a chance.</p><p>A person like Lu Ming must have a shocking number of points. If they could kill Lu Ming, their points would skyrocket.</p><p>Many people had this thought and hid in the dark.</p><p>On the eleventh day, Lu Ming was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the street, meditating on the incomplete divine skill with his eyes closed. At that moment, he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>In front of him, a figure was leaping from house to house at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he was in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, more than thirty young men from the Tiger Tribe appeared on the street in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could see at a glance that one of them was Hu Mao.</p><p>At that moment, Hu Mao was looking at Lu Ming with a face full of hatred.</p><p>tiger bone, it’s him.
