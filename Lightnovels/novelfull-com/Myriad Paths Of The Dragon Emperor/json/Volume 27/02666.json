The Spear’s radiance was dazzling as it charged toward the other party.</p><p>The other party was shocked. He tried his best to resist but it was useless. He was sent flying by Lu Ming. Even his divine weapon was sent flying and his arms were broken.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and directly blew up the sixth level void G.o.d-level existence, killing him on the spot.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The other two were shocked.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light shot towards Lu Ming at a terrifying speed. It was an arrow, a terrifying arrow.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming swept his long spear backward and collided with the arrow.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An intense explosion sounded out as if the sun had exploded, creating shockwaves that spread out in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled continuously. A terrifying force surged through Lu Ming’s long spear and charged towards him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure drifted backward. He only stopped after he retreated a few hundred meters.</p><p>“The attack power of these arrows is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his arm was a little numb and he was secretly shocked.</p><p>“Brat, you can actually block my attack!”</p><p>A shocked voice was heard.</p><p>In the forest far away, seven or eight figures flickered and rushed over. One of them was the young man with the big bow.</p><p>“Nest, there are so many people …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Before, there were only five of them, including the young man with the bow. Now, there were five or six more. Some of them had terrifying auras that were not any weaker than the young man with the bow.</p><p>Needless to say, from the killing intent emanating from the other party, he was also from Huang Wu’s sect.</p><p>Right now, Lu Ming could barely contend against a seventh-level void G.o.d, but he could not defeat the other party. The key was that Lu Ming kept activating the battle character formula in an attempt to trigger the tripled combat power, but he kept failing.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and rushed towards Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had joined forces to defeat the sixth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm young man and had already suppressed him.</p><p>Meanwhile, QiuQiu was locked in a fierce battle with that seventh-level void G.o.d Realm existence.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He rushed to Xie nianqing’s side and stabbed the young man with his spear.</p><p>The other party was shocked. However, he was already suppressed by Xie nianqing and Lu Ming. How could he deal with Lu Ming? he was stabbed to death by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Two people had died in a row. The bow-wielding youth and the rest were furious. He shot another arrow but it was blocked by Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and QiuQiu also abandoned their opponents and ran in one direction.</p><p>“Chase him! We must kill him! Kill this b.a.s.t.a.r.d!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Furious roars came from behind them as they charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I’m still a little weak!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little depressed.</p><p>There were too many people on the other side. If there were only five people, they could still fight. But now, the number of people on the other side had doubled. If they were to fight, they would be in danger.</p><p>The chase and escape covered thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.</p><p>There was someone in front!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up!</p><p>If they had met other disciples of the sect, the people from the floating light Faction would not have been so bold as to attack them in public. Although they were no longer in the sect, the other party would still have some reservations.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression changed at the next moment.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of the people in front of him.</p><p>One of them was a young man in luxurious clothes from the Tianhong Saint son’s faction. He had previously asked Lu Ming to meet the young man surnamed Ying with an extremely bad att.i.tude.</p><p>At that moment, the other party also saw Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“It’s this brat …”</p><p>The eyes of the young man in luxurious clothes turned cold. this brat actually dared to reject the invitation of our Tianhong Saint son’s faction. He’ll be a disaster sooner or later. It’s a good time to get rid of him now. Attack!</p><p>Immediately, the young man in luxurious clothes and the others rushed toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly groaned.</p><p>He didn’t expect to meet the young man in luxurious clothes and the others here. From the killing intent they emitted, it went without saying that they wanted to kill him as well.</p><p>“You want to kill me just because you refused to join the other party’s camp …”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anger.</p><p>When his strength increased in the future, he would definitely destroy the Tianhong Saint son’s and the transient light Saint son’s factions with his own hands.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>A long sword appeared in the hand of the young man in luxurious clothes. He slashed out with a terrifying power.</p><p>The young man had reached peak seventh level of ethereal G.o.d Realm, which was not far from eighth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm. His power was very shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were unwilling to fight head-on with the other party. Once they were entangled by the other party, they would be in trouble when the powerful enemies behind them caught up and surrounded them.</p><p>With so many experts, once they joined forces, they would be in great danger.</p><p>They immediately changed direction and rushed to the right.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes led a few people and chased after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Behind him, the bow-wielding youth and the others also chased after him.</p><p>“Eh? He’s from the floating light Faction. This kid injured Huang Wu, so it’s normal for these people to want to kill him!”</p><p>The luxuriously dressed young man’s heart moved, and he immediately knew what was going on.</p><p>“Let’s join forces and kill this brat!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes sent a message to the bow-wielding young man and the others.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The two parties. .h.i.t it off and chased after Lu Ming and the rest together.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in the sky. It was the outer sect Deacon of the Tianhong faction. The old man’s name was le Zhong.</p><p>this kid is actually fine. He’s really lucky!</p><p>A cold light flashed in le Zhong’s eyes, and then he looked back.</p><p>From that direction, a ray of light was approaching at an extreme speed. It was another outer sect Deacon.</p><p>“We can’t let him ruin this. I’ll stop him!”</p><p>He muttered to himself and then flew to another Deacon.</p><p>le Zhong, what’s going on? I can feel a huge movement here!</p><p>The deacon who came later said.</p><p>“It’s fine. Some disciples are chasing after a few plant life forms. Don’t worry, I’m here. Nothing will happen!”</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>The deacon who came later did not doubt him. He nodded and left.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest ran for another ten thousand miles. They slowed down. When they reached this place, it became more and more remote. However, there were fewer and fewer plants, especially plant life forms. They almost did not encounter any.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Suddenly, they discovered that an abyss had appeared in front of them. Blood-red mist was constantly emitting from the abyss, seriously blocking their vision and making it impossible to see what was inside.</p><p>“Let’s go in …”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not stop and rushed towards the abyss.</p><p>In the abyss, there was a blood-red mist that obstructed his vision. This way, he could use the environment here to shake off the other party.</p><p>However, when they reached the sky above the abyss, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>In the abyss, a terrifying gravitational force suddenly acted on their bodies. This gravitational force was too strong, making it difficult for them to fly. They directly fell into the abyss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
