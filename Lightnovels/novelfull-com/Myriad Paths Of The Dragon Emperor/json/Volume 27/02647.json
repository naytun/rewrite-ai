There were only 12 people left out of the 25.</p><p>Among the twelve people, a few of them were still fighting each other.</p><p>There were a few people who looked at Lu Ming warily.</p><p>In addition, yang Chong was standing with his hands behind his back. He had not made a move yet, and the others were far away from him.</p><p>“You’re Lu Ming? You’re pretty strong, so why don’t we join forces and get rid of the others?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard a voice. It was yang Chong’s voice.</p><p>It was obvious that yang Chong had acknowledged Lu Ming’s abilities. He took the initiative to look for him to work together and eliminate the others. This way, the two of them could enter the top ten.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed immediately.</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s reply, a cold glint flashed across yang Chong’s eyes. He stepped forward and walked toward a young man.</p><p>The young man was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>However, yang Chong’s speed suddenly increased. He appeared in front of the young man and struck out with his palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This palm was shockingly powerful. Although the young man tried his best to block it, his body exploded when yang Chong’s palm landed. He had no way to resist.</p><p>Then, his body condensed on the stone platform, his face pale.</p><p>it’s too terrifying. Is that the power of the sacred grade divine power? ”</p><p>This young man still had a fearful expression on his face.</p><p>His divine power was a King grade divine power, and it was a rather powerful King grade divine power. However, it could not withstand a single blow from yang Chong’s Saint grade divine power. It was crushed and crushed like tofu.</p><p>speed-type incomplete divine skill, peak of the fourth level!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He could tell that yang Chong had also cultivated an incomplete speed-type divine skill that had reached the peak of the fourth level, which was even stronger than situ Feng’s speed-type divine skill.</p><p>“It’s my turn!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was like a ROC as he pounced on a youth, his long spear pressing down like a mountain.</p><p>The young man could not withstand the attack of Lu Ming’s fifth incomplete divine skill at all. His body was shattered by the impact.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming and yang Chong, there were eight other people in the fighting ring.</p><p>Originally, there were a few people fighting, but at this time, they couldn’t help but stop.</p><p>the two of them want to join forces to kill us. Let’s join forces!</p><p>that’s right. Let’s work together. We’re all at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm. No matter how strong they are, we don’t need to fear them if we work together!</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>On the battle Mountain, eight young men gathered together.</p><p>“So what if we join forces? get down!”</p><p>Yang Chong was incomparably domineering, his divine power howling as he charged at them.</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the eight people from the other side.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Yang Chong’s full strength was indeed astonishing.</p><p>&Nbsp; the divine power was a peak stage four incomplete offensive divine skill, and a peak stage four speed divine skill. When combined, it was like a violent tide.</p><p>Lu Ming did not unleash his divine power to the maximum. He cast the soul transformation technique and concealed the level of his divine power to King-grade.</p><p>Moreover, his cultivation was only at the demiG.o.d level, which was slightly weaker. However, Lu Ming’s incomplete divine skill had reached the fifth level, and its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>Each spear strike contained eleven bursts of power, each stronger than the last.</p><p>Although the eight young men had joined forces, they were no match for Lu Ming and yang Chong. They were forced to retreat.</p><p>“The battle has been decided!”</p><p>“Lu Ming and yang Chong are indeed the strongest in this round!”</p><p>Many people shook their heads. There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>Not long after, the eight young men were blasted off the fighting ring by Lu Ming and yang Chong, ending the battle.</p><p>Lu Ming and yang Chong were the last to stay behind. They had already secured a spot in the top ten.</p><p>“Brother fa Ming, congratulations, congratulations!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had entered the top 10, some of the leaders of the forces in the chaotic astral River congratulated the ancestor of technique one after another, their faces full of flattery.</p><p>Some of them had just been fawning over situ haonan, but in the blink of an eye, they had gone to fawn over the ancestor of technique.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan’s faces were extremely ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming had made it into the top ten. It was almost certain that he would join the three Overlord forces. Even if situ Feng could join the three Overlord forces, he would not be as highly regarded as Lu Ming. How could he compete with Lu Ming?</p><p>The two of them were already panicking.</p><p>Lu Ming and yang Chong locked onto the top ten and retreated from the fighting ring.</p><p>Then, the next group of twenty-five people went on stage.</p><p>This time, Hu ya was the center of attention, as well as the person who had obtained first place in a certain battle zone in the first round of the a.s.sessment.</p><p>On the surface, these two people were the strongest.</p><p>The result wasn’t too surprising. After a battle, Hu ya and that heaven’s favorite obtained a place in the top ten.</p><p>Then the third group!</p><p>In this group, the Golden Sage won without a doubt.</p><p>In addition, there was also an extremely beautiful woman. Unexpectedly, she defeated someone who was ranked first in a certain battle region in the first round and obtained the top ten.</p><p>The fourth group, Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye’s display of terrifying combat strength shocked everyone.</p><p>The Shen power that Linghu ye controlled was just normal Shen power.</p><p>This was the only one among the existing people!</p><p>However, the incomplete divine skill that he had just revealed was shocking.</p><p>It was an incomplete speed-type divine skill at the peak of the fifth level!</p><p>It was an attack-type incomplete divine skill, and it was also at the peak of the fifth level.</p><p>The combination of the two allowed him to win directly, defeating strong enemies one after another.</p><p>two incomplete divine skills have both reached the peak of the fifth level. This level of comprehension is simply too shocking!</p><p>“What a terrifying comprehension!”</p><p>Everyone was amazed.</p><p>The eyes of the experts from the Qin heavenly thirteen clans also lit up.</p><p>To a large sect like the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, comprehension was extremely important.</p><p>But what did it matter?</p><p>The Qin heavenly thirteen clans had divine techniques and wondrous Arts. As long as one cultivated the divine techniques and wondrous Arts to an extremely high level, one’s divine power level would naturally rise.</p><p>As long as one’s comprehension ability was heaven-defying enough, there were even divine techniques in the three Overlord forces that could even raise divine-grade divine power.</p><p>The experts of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans were already thinking about how to invite Linghu ye.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming, yang Chong, the Golden Sage, and Hu ya were all invited.</p><p>The fifth group’s compet.i.tion also ended very quickly.</p><p>The top ten were born!</p><p>However, the compet.i.tion had to continue.</p><p>Since they were going to compete, they naturally had to determine who was stronger. Furthermore, the experts from the Qin heaven thirteen clans also wanted to see if there were any people who were still holding back.</p><p>next, the ten of you will fight in pairs. The odds are random. Let’s begin!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, two people’s bodies started to shine.</p><p>One of them was Linghu ye, and the other was the person who had won first place in the first round.</p><p>The two of them didn’t say much and directly attacked.</p><p>Linghu ye’s opponent was also very strong. He had also cultivated two incomplete divine skills, both of which had reached the peak of stage four. The divine power he controlled was a terrifying King-grade divine power.</p><p>The two of them exchanged hundreds of moves, and Linghu ye was the one who won in the end.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
