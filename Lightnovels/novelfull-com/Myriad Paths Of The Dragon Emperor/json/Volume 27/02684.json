I’m really disappointed!”</p><p>In the fighting ring, Lu Ming shook his head and looked at Dongfang Hao in disdain.</p><p>kid, don’t think that you can be arrogant just because you blocked two of my moves. I’ll kill you with my next move!</p><p>Dong fanghao roared, his killing intent as sharp as a blade.</p><p>He was a ninth-tier virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse and an expert on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. To him, it was a great humiliation that he could not kill Lu Ming, who was a fourth-tier virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse, even after he used his ultimate skill.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Dongfang Hao shouted as he raised his saber with both hands. His divine power burst out, and saber rays appeared above his head.</p><p>In the end, a total of nine blade gleams appeared. Each of them exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>Dongfang Hao had pushed his G.o.dly skill to its limit.</p><p>void nine slashes, nine slashes annihilate G.o.d!</p><p>die! Dongfang Hao bellowed. The nine rays of saber radiance exuded a terrifying aura, carrying the power to destroy G.o.ds, and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Before the saber ray had even reached him, the terrifying Saber Force had already swept toward Lu Ming, wanting to tear him apart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. At this moment, Lu Ming circulated the ruler’s divine energy to the extreme. At the same time, Lu Ming activated the double combat power of the battle character formula.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was filled with powerful energy. Once again, he shot out with his spear. This time, Lu Ming did not use the divine skill. Instead, he used the incomplete divine skill.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine rays of saber radiance that Dongfang Hao had condensed slashed toward Lu Ming one after another, each more powerful than the last.</p><p>Every time it slashed down and collided with Lu Ming’s long spear, there would be a terrifying explosion.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats as they stared unblinkingly at the scene. They wanted to know if Lu Ming would be killed by Dongfang Hao in one strike.</p><p>I hope Dongfang Hao can kill that kid!</p><p>Those who had bet on Dongfang Hao’s victory kept praying in their hearts, hoping that Lu Ming would die in Dongfang Hao’s hands.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were destined to be disappointed!</p><p>After nine loud bangs, Lu Ming stood still, completely unscathed. He did not even have a single wound on him. Dongfang Hao, on the other hand, was panting.</p><p>Although a ninth level void G.o.d Realm expert could use divine techniques, it consumed a lot of divine power.</p><p>Dongfang Hao had used up a lot of his divine power just now.</p><p>“What? He’s not dead yet!”</p><p>“That Lu Ming, why is he not dead yet!”</p><p>Many people were shocked. They couldn’t believe that a fourth-level void G.o.d Realm cultivator could still stand after Dongfang Hao’s full-force attack. How was this possible?</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, this brat, why isn’t he dead yet!”</p><p>Around the fighting ring, many people, including le Zhong and the other deacons of the outer gate, were roaring.</p><p>Each of them had bet a large number of divine crystals. Le Zhong, in particular, had bet a total of 20 million divine crystals. He hoped very much that Lu Ming would be killed.</p><p>what powerful strength! As expected of someone who possesses a gold token!</p><p>The three enforcement Hall’s elders had a look of shock in their eyes as well.</p><p>Previously, they had guessed that Lu Ming might be the disciple of some Big Shot in Kong Xuan sect. Now, they felt that it was very possible. Otherwise, how could he be so powerful?</p><p>They secretly rejoiced. It seemed that they had made the right decision to help Lu Ming this time!</p><p>“Dongfang Hao, is this all you’ve got? How disappointing. Well then, it’s my turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and charged at Dongfang Hao. His long spear was like a mountain range, pressing down on Dongfang Hao.</p><p>no! Dongfang Hao used his remaining divine power to block it, but after the collision, he was forced back, his face pale and his body trembling.</p><p>Just now, he had used all his strength to release the divine skill and it had consumed too much divine power. At this moment, he could no longer block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he continued to attack with his spear, shrouding Dongfang Hao in layers of spear shadows.</p><p>Dongfang Hao charged left and right but it was useless. He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He was caught off guard and was. .h.i.t by Lu Ming’s spear. More than a dozen layers of power burst out and hit Dongfang Hao. He screamed in pain and was sent flying. He spat out a mouthful of blood. A big hole had been blown into his chest, and his breath was weak.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me …”</p><p>Dongfang Hao yelled in terror.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stepped forward, his killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>senior brother Huang Wen, save me, save me!</p><p>Dongfang Hao screamed at the top of his lungs.</p><p>If this continued, he would really die. He was so scared that he almost peed his pants.</p><p>Before the battle, he would never have dreamed that it would end up like this. In his mind, he could easily kill Lu Ming and he would not be in any danger.</p><p>If he had known that Lu Ming was so terrifying, he would never have sent out the life-and-death duel letter.</p><p>“Lu Ming, that’s enough!”</p><p>Huang Wen shouted with a dark expression.</p><p>that’s right. We’re all senior and junior brothers. It’s enough to determine the victor. There’s no need to take his life!</p><p>Le Zhong also said.</p><p>hahaha, what a joke. You guys don’t know that this is a Deathmatch. Dongfang Hao and I have signed a Deathmatch agreement. Only one of us can leave the stage!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>“When it’s possible to forgive someone, one should forgive them!”</p><p>Le Zhong said coldly.</p><p>“I’ll spare you, you b * stard!”</p><p>f * ck! Lu Ming cursed. He charged at Dongfang Hao with his spear at the speed of lightning.</p><p>ah! Dongfang Hao screamed hysterically and tried to Dodge, but it was useless. The spear pierced through his head.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Dongfang Hao’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>Dongfang Hao was dead!</p><p>he’s dead! Dongfang Hao is dead!</p><p>Many people’s faces turned pale and they broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>They had bet a lot of their skills on Dongfang Hao’s victory. Some of them had even bet their entire net worth. But now, Dongfang Hao was dead.</p><p>“I … My divine crystals!”</p><p>Someone screamed in pain and wanted to beat his chest and stamp his feet.</p><p>As for those who didn’t have time to place their bets, they were extremely glad.</p><p>They had been secretly angry that they had come a step too late and lost the chance to ‘pick up money’. Now, they realized how lucky they were.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>In the midst of the music, there were a few other deacons whose faces were as black as charcoal.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>Below the fighting ring, Huang Wen, Huang Wu, and the others were all pale.</p><p>Dongfang Hao is dead?</p><p>They found it hard to believe.</p><p>A disciple who had just joined the sect a few years ago had actually killed Dongfang Hao, who was on the virtual G.o.d ranking.</p><p>In the fighting ring, Lu Ming shook his spear, shaking off the blood on it. Then, he reached out and sucked Dongfang Hao’s storage ring into his hand. It was his spoils of war.</p><p>elders, I’ve killed Dongfang Hao. I’ve won. Those divine crystals are all mine!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the three Tribunal Council elders.</p><p>that’s right, you’ve won. These storage rings are for you!</p><p>One of the enforcement Hall’s elders suppressed the shock in his heart and threw the storage ring to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming caught it with a fiery look in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
