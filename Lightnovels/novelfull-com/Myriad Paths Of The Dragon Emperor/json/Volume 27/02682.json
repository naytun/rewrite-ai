You can rest a.s.sured now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, everyone. We can bear witness to this!”</p><p>An elder of the Tribunal Council spoke and said no more.</p><p>After all, they were a little embarra.s.sed to witness such a thing.</p><p>“I have a question. Even with the three elders of the Tribunal Council as witnesses, do you have enough divine crystals to compensate us if we win?”</p><p>An outer sect disciple shouted.</p><p>that’s right. If you’re trying to trick us, then we’ve bet for nothing!</p><p>“That’s right. How many divine crystals do you have?”</p><p>Many people asked.</p><p>Indeed, they had their doubts. They were afraid that Lu Ming did not have that many divine crystals with him.</p><p>“I know you don’t believe me, so I’ll show you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a pile of divine crystals appeared in the air, exuding a strong divine Qi fluctuation.</p><p>here are 1.5 million divine crystals. According to the odds of one to one, it’s enough for you to bet 150 million divine crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Lu Ming had sold some middle-grade divine artifacts and had 1.6 million divine crystals left.</p><p>“So many divine crystals!”</p><p>“Lu Ming is actually so rich!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” in addition, if you’re still worried, you can also p.a.w.n off this middle-quality divine artifact! Zhao Feng said.</p><p>Lu Ming took out two divine weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming still had five middle-grade divine artifacts left. They were all level three middle-grade divine artifacts and above. Now, he took out two of them, both of which were level four middle-grade divine artifacts. Each of them could be sold for 150000 divine crystals.</p><p>The two swords could be sold for a total of three million Yuan, and even many outer sect deacons were looking at them with burning eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming actually has so many divine crystals and treasures on him. He’s really willing to take them out!”</p><p>he knows he’s about to die, so he’s not going to bring it with him. He’s just trying to give it away before he dies so that Dongfang Hao won’t take advantage of it!</p><p>definitely, definitely!</p><p>Many people thought that Lu Ming knew that he was no match for Dongfang Hao and was going to die at his hands. He was not willing to let his wealth fall into Dongfang Hao’s hands, so he distributed his wealth in this way to disgust Dongfang Hao.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>As expected, Dongfang Hao was disgusted and roared in his heart.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would have so much wealth on him. In his opinion, as long as he killed Lu Ming, all this wealth would be his. However, Lu Ming actually wanted to distribute this wealth. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>all right, let’s place our bets now. If you bet on Dongfang Hao, a hundred for one. If you bet on me, a hundred for one!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>I’ll bet! I’ll bet two hundred thousand on Dongfang Hao!</p><p>I bet three hundred thousand divine crystals on Dongfang Hao!</p><p>“I’ll bet two hundred thousand divine crystals too!”</p><p>……</p><p>At once, a group of outer sect disciples rushed forward in a frenzy. They were betting on Dongfang Haosheng with almost all their a.s.sets. In their opinion, Lu Ming was giving away his wealth. It would be a waste if they did not take it.</p><p>“One by one, don’t worry, I’ll write a written pledge for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out his brush and ink and wrote down notes one after another.</p><p>Then, piles of divine crystals were stored in Lu Ming’s storage ring. In a short while, Lu Ming had collected fifty million divine crystals.</p><p>if you buy a hundred, you’ll have to pay one. If you buy a million, you’ll earn ten thousand. It’s a waste if you don’t buy it!</p><p>Even some of the outer sect deacons were tempted.</p><p>Of course, the outer sect elders just smiled. They didn’t care about the divine crystals.</p><p>“Big brother, shall we go bet as well?”</p><p>Huang Wu looked at Huang Wen.</p><p>good. Liu Ji, go and place a bet for me. Five million divine crystals!</p><p>Huang Wen said. With a wave of his hand, a storage ring flew towards one of the young men.</p><p>He couldn’t show up himself, so he called another young man to help.</p><p>As expected of a genius of the inner sect, he offered five million in one go.</p><p>Liu Ji took it and went to bet on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming received more and more divine crystals. Very soon, he had received more than one hundred million.</p><p>At this moment, a few figures appeared beside Lu Ming. They were the outer sect deacons.</p><p>“Le Zhong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. One of the outer sect deacons was le Zhong. Back then, in the forest, he had wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Deacons, do you also want to place a bet?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t welcome me?”</p><p>Le sneered.</p><p>you’re welcome. Of course, you’re welcome. How much are you betting? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“I’ll bet twenty million low-grade divine crystals!”</p><p>Le Zhong took out a storage ring.</p><p>“I’ll give you 10 million too!”</p><p>“I’ll also pay 15 million!”</p><p>A few deacons spoke one after another.</p><p>These deacons were all from the Tianhong sect. Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and accepted them one by one.</p><p>“Interesting, shall we play?”</p><p>“If I can earn divine crystals, why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>At that moment, a group of young men and women flew toward Lu Ming. All of them had a strong aura and were full of confidence.</p><p>Many outer sect disciples ‘expressions changed when they saw this, and they revealed looks of respect.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite on the virtual G.o.d ranking list!</p><p>These young men and women were all heaven’s favorites on the virtual G.o.d ranking. They were all ranked above Dongfang Hao and were definitely powerful.</p><p>This time, the battle between Lu Ming and Dongfang Hao had attracted the attention of other virtual G.o.d rankers.</p><p>“Place your bets!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance at these people.</p><p>this kid really doesn’t know what’s good for him. I’ll bet five million!</p><p>A purple-robed young man took out a storage ring and said indifferently. He looked at Lu Ming as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p>he’s just joined the sect, and he’s already challenging Dongfang Hao. What a fool! I’ll bet five million too!</p><p>Another young man chimed in.</p><p>These people were all geniuses from the floating light Faction. They belonged to the same faction as Dongfang Hao. Naturally, they did not like Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He did not reject anything and took all of them.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming received a total of two hundred million divine crystals.</p><p>If he lost, he would have to pay two million G.o.d crystals.</p><p>200 million. Haha, I’m rich now. I can cultivate in any of the cultivation sanctuaries in the inner sect!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll hand over the divine crystals I’ve received and my own to the elders of the Tribunal Council for safekeeping. If I die in battle, you can go to the elders to collect the divine crystals according to the receipt!”</p><p>Lu Ming handed a few storage rings to the three Tribunal Council elders.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked at Dongfang Hao and said,”Dongfang Hao, why don’t we have a fight today?”</p><p>“Since you’re so eager to die, I’ll naturally fulfill your wish!”</p><p>let’s go! Dongfang Hao said coldly. Then, he rose into the air and landed on the life-and-death stage.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and stepped onto the fighting ring as well, standing opposite Dongfang Hao.</p><p>“It’s about to start. I wonder how many moves Lu Ming can take from Dongfang Hao?”</p><p>Dongfang Hao is at the peak of virtual G.o.d and his combat strength far exceeds his peers. I’m afraid Lu Ming won’t be able to take three moves!</p><p>I think so too. Let alone three moves, even one move is profound. Let’s just wait to collect divine crystals!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
