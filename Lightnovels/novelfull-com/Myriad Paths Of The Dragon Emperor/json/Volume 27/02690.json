Now, he found that he was still poor.</p><p>“It’s a pity that there aren’t any Saint-grade divine skills!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked through the books but did not see any divine grade techniques. He shook his head in pity.</p><p>The Saint grade Divine Art was the Kong Xuan sect’s Divine Art. Only a few people had the right to cultivate it, so it was normal that there were no such people here.</p><p>“I’d better exchange for a few King-grade divine arts and techniques to cultivate first!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>As for divine skills, he had the ninefold Crimson Gold armor and the three apocalyptic strikes, which were enough for now. He didn’t need to exchange for anything else.</p><p>As for the secret skills, although Lu Ming was very excited, the price was too expensive. He could not afford to exchange for them and could only give up.</p><p>However, he didn’t have enough points on him now. He had to go and Exchange some points first, then come here to exchange for the king-grade divine skill.</p><p>Lu Ming left the Scriptures Depository and went to the points exchange area. He took out 150 million divine crystals and exchanged them for 15000 points. Then, he went to the Scriptures Depository again.</p><p>“This is the Golden Dragon divine technique and this is the great sun divine technique,”</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on the two divine techniques.</p><p>The Golden Dragon divine technique required five thousand points, and the great sun divine technique required three thousand points.</p><p>Lu Ming decided to exchange for these two temporarily.</p><p>“Senior, I want to exchange for a King-grade divine skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to an elder when they arrived at the main entrance of the Scripture chamber.</p><p>“Exchange for divine techniques? The price of a King-grade wondrous technique is not cheap. Which one do you want to exchange for?”</p><p>The old man sized up the interior and revealed a trace of curiosity.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation level could not be hidden from him. He could tell at a glance that Lu Ming was at the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>How could an ethereal G.o.d Realm fourth level cultivator have so many points to exchange for a King-grade technique?</p><p>“Senior, I would like to exchange for the Golden Dragon divine technique and the great sun divine technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“What? You want to exchange for two?”</p><p>The old man was truly shocked. Then, he said with a straight face, kid, you only need to cultivate one king-grade wondrous technique. It’s useless to exchange for two!</p><p>I know that I don’t exchange for it for my own cultivation. There’s one that I exchange for others!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t say that he had cultivated it himself.</p><p>alright, since that’s the case, I won’t say anything more. These two divine techniques are a total of 8000 points!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Senior, this is my ident.i.ty token!”</p><p>Lu Ming pa.s.sed his ident.i.ty token to the old man. The old man took it and swiped it on an array disc. Eight thousand points were immediately deducted.</p><p>this little guy actually has so many points.</p><p>The old man was also slightly surprised, and then said, ” “Wait for me here. I’ll go get the two divine techniques!”</p><p>The old man stood up and entered the Scripture chamber. Not long after, he came back with two scrolls and handed them to Lu Ming. They were the two divine techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed as he kept it. He left the Sutra library and headed straight for the divine pulse tower.</p><p>After entering the divine pulse tower, Lu Ming devoted himself to the cultivation of the two divine techniques.</p><p>These two divine techniques were indeed more profound than the ice G.o.d technique. The Shen power cultivated would also be stronger.</p><p>Of course, the difficulty of cultivation was also greater.</p><p>Lu Ming spent a few months and successfully cultivated two divine fires.</p><p>However, the divine flame was rather dim and needed time to slowly strengthen.</p><p>Time flew by. Lu Ming had been in the divine pulse tower for five years.</p><p>After five years, Lu Ming had finally cultivated the two divine flames to the size of the divine flames of domination. Moreover, when the two divine flames were cultivated to the size of the divine flames of domination, Lu Ming actually broke through in one go and his cultivation level rose to fifth-level void G.o.d-level.</p><p>my ability to challenge those of higher cultivation levels is much stronger than before!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Now, if he used his ruler’s divine power, the other divine powers would fuse with it, and when it exploded, its power would be even more astonishing.</p><p>“I’ve been cultivating for so long, let’s go out for a walk!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He ended his cultivation and walked out of the divine pulse tower.</p><p>After staying for such a long time, Lu Ming’s points had decreased by nearly 2000 points.</p><p>In addition to the points that he exchanged for the wondrous techniques, Lu Ming only had about five thousand points left from the fifteen thousand points that he had exchanged.</p><p>“This is the inner sect area. I can ask around about the ‘Yuexin’ that the ancestor of technique is looking for.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Back then, the ancestor of technique had given him a dagger and asked him to bring it to ‘Yuexin’. In the past, Lu Ming was in the outer sect area and could not find it at all. However, now that Lu Ming could freely enter and exit the inner sect area, he could search for it.</p><p>“Who are you looking for?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and his eyes suddenly lit up. He thought of Yue Linglong.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a message to Yue Linglong. To his surprise, he received a reply not long after.</p><p>Yue Linglong told him to wait for her outside the divine pulse tower and she would be there in a while.</p><p>Not long after, a ray of light flew over and a figure landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“You, you actually took so long to contact me?”</p><p>Yue Linglong cast a sidelong glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>haha, I’ve been so busy with cultivation that I forgot!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled awkwardly.</p><p>“Why are you looking for me now?”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked, blinking her eyes.</p><p>I want to ask you about someone. I don’t know anyone in the inner sect, so I’m asking you first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I knew you were looking for me. Tell me, who do you want to know? I know everything in the inner court. You’ve found the right person to ask me about it!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said smugly.</p><p>“I want to ask, do you know this person called ‘Yuexin’?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yuexin!”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes suddenly widened. She took a few careful glances at Lu Ming and asked curiously, ” “Why are you looking for Yuexin? Are you her illegitimate child?”</p><p>Towards the end of her sentence, Yue Linglong’s eyes lit up as if she had discovered something new.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. What was this girl thinking!</p><p>please don’t make wild guesses. I’m only here to find Yuexin on someone’s request!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“You’re really not an illegitimate child?”</p><p>Yue Linglong seemed unwilling to give up and asked again.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids kept twitching. He held it in for a while and gritted his teeth.”Absolutely not!”</p><p>Oh, then why did someone ask you to look for Yuexin? ”</p><p>Yue Linglong asked again.</p><p>“Bring an item, and a word!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh? Could the person who entrusted you to be Yuexin’s old lover?”</p><p>Yue Linglong blinked her eyes. The fire of gossip was burning.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This girl was right. However, his expression did not change as he said, I don’t know about that. You’ve been asking so many questions. Do you know who Yuexin is? ”</p><p>of course I know. Yuexin is my aunt. How can I not know? ”</p><p>Yue Linglong pouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
