He also had two incomplete divine skills that had been cultivated to the peak of stage four.</p><p>However, one of the incomplete divine skills that Lu Ming had displayed had reached the fifth level. Naturally, the other party was no match for him. After a fierce battle, he was blasted off the fighting ring by Lu Ming.</p><p>Following that, Golden Saint, Hu ya, and yang Chong all defeated their opponents one by one.</p><p>It seemed that everything could be arranged. Lu Ming, Linghu ye, yang Chong, Hu ya, and the Golden Sage did not meet.</p><p>However, the remaining five would eventually clash.</p><p>“The peak confrontation is coming!”</p><p>Everyone revealed a look of antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming, Linghu ye, yang Chong, Golden Sage, and Hu ya were all going to fight.</p><p>This was going to be a peak battle!</p><p>“Who do you think is the strongest among the five of them?”</p><p>I think the top three should be Golden Sage, Hu ya, and yang Chong. Lu Ming is slightly stronger than Linghu ye, and Linghu ye is the weakest!</p><p>I think so too. Although Golden Sage, Hu ya, and yang Chong’s comprehension of incomplete divine skills is not as good as Lu Ming and Linghu ye’s, they have mastered divine-grade divine power and are extremely powerful!</p><p>that’s right. It’s hard to say who’s stronger in the future, but for now, Lu Ming and Linghu ye are at a disadvantage in terms of divine power. I’m afraid they’re not yang Chong, Golden Sage, and Hu ya’s match!</p><p>Many people were discussing who would win. Most of them believed that Golden Saint, Hu ya, and yang Chong would be the top three.</p><p>Lu Ming and Linghu ye found it difficult to fight against the three of them.</p><p>“It’s hard to say. What if Linghu ye and Lu Ming are still holding back?”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>“You’re holding back? You’re saying that the incomplete divine skill they comprehended is even more advanced?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>that shouldn’t be possible. It’s already shocking enough to comprehend an incomplete divine skill to this extent in just three years. There aren’t many in history who can do this!</p><p>that’s right. I think they’ve already done their best!</p><p>Most of the people shook their heads in objection. They felt that Lu Ming and Linghu ye would not hold back.</p><p>……</p><p>alright, let’s begin the final battle. There are five of you left, so I’ll randomly pick one person to pa.s.s. The other four will fight each other!</p><p>The middle-aged man in the sky spoke again.</p><p>Then, he waved his hand and the Jade talisman above the Golden saint’s head lit up.</p><p>for this round, the Golden Sage will be free to fight. The other four can choose their opponents at will!</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>The compet.i.tion this time around was merely a test for the Qin heaven thirteen clans to recruit disciples. With the experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans here to observe, there was no need to be so fair. The rules were more casual.</p><p>As long as they displayed their strength, the experts of the Qin heaven 13 clans would be able to see who was stronger and who had more potential.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Yang Chong was the first to leap onto the fighting ring. His gaze swept across Lu Ming, Hu ya, and Linghu ye before finally landing on Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye, you have a high level of comprehension, but your divine power is too weak. Fight with me. I want to see if you still have any hidden strength!</p><p>Yang Chong said.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Linghu ye stepped into the air and a long sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without saying anything else, yang Chong immediately attacked. His entire body was suffused with scarlet divine power, making him look like a G.o.d of the sun.</p><p>&Nbsp; the violent divine power, combined with the peak fourth level speed-type divine skill, made his speed reach an extreme.</p><p>He crossed the battle stage in an instant and approached Linghu ye. The violent palm force poured down on Linghu ye like an avalanche.</p><p>The incomplete offensive divine skill that yang Chong had chosen complemented his divine power. It was scorching hot and powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out, and sword Qi soared into the sky. Linghu ye slashed out more than ten times in a row, and each sword light cut into yang Chong’s palm energy.</p><p>However, the sword lights trembled and were crushed by yang Chong’s palm energy. The terrifying palm energy suddenly burst out and rushed toward Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye’s body was as light as a feather. He drifted backward until he reached the edge of the fighting ring to avoid yang Chong’s palm energy.</p><p>“Linghu ye is no match for him!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Linghu ye’s Shen power is too low. Normal Shen power, no matter how strong it is or how powerful it is, can’t compete with sacred-grade Shen power!</p><p>“Indeed, even if his incomplete Shen technique is more profound, it is not much, so it is still useless!”</p><p>“I told you, he should be the weakest among the five!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>“Linghu ye, if that’s all you’ve got, then let’s end this!”</p><p>let’s go! yang Chong said as he rushed towards Linghu ye like a fiery meteor. A fiery red palm print, ten meters in length and width, was sent towards Linghu ye.</p><p>However, Linghu ye’s face was still calm, and he didn’t panic at all.</p><p>He raised the longsword in his hand, and the longsword began to vibrate at a strange frequency.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, Linghu ye suddenly slashed out with his sword. A beam of sword light burst out and collided with yang Chong’s palm energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying explosion reverberated in all directions.</p><p>Yang Chong’s palm force was actually blocked and kept shaking.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that everyone saw yang Chong’s palm energy being cut apart by Linghu ye’s sword light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, yang Chong’s palm energy was split into two, and Linghu ye’s sword light also dispersed.</p><p>It was blocked!</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Linghu ye had actually blocked yang Chong’s palm energy.</p><p>&Nbsp; yang Chong’s divine power was a sacred divine power, and a palm that combined it with an incomplete fourth-level divine skill was shockingly powerful, but Linghu ye had used ordinary divine power to block yang Chong’s palm.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“The sixth level, this is the sixth level of an incomplete divine skill!”</p><p>Someone shouted in disbelief.</p><p>my G.o.d, Linghu ye has already cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the sixth level. How is this possible? ”</p><p>Many people exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>One had to know that yang Chong, the Golden Saint, and Hu ya, who were all geniuses with divine grade divine power, had only cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the peak of the fourth level.</p><p>It had only been three short years since he had reached the sixth level. This level of comprehension was too terrifying.</p><p>“The sixth level!”</p><p>The eyes of the experts from the Qin heavenly thirteen clans all lit up as they stared at Linghu ye.</p><p>This kind of terrifying comprehension ability, they were determined to have it.</p><p>I didn’t expect that you’ve already cultivated an offensive incomplete divine skill to the sixth level!</p><p>Yang Chong’s eyes were also solemn.</p><p>The incomplete sixth level of the divine skill could already be a direct match for him.</p><p>“However, you will still lose!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! yang Chong roared, his divine power bursting forth as his burly body charged at Linghu ye. His palms continued to strike out at Linghu ye.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
