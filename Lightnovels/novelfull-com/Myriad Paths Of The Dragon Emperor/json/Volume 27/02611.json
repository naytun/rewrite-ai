The suction force at the front of the pa.s.sage was too strong. Lu Ming was not prepared at all and was sucked in at once.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming was like a small boat in a huge wave, drifting with the current and being thrown out directly.</p><p>Soon, they reached the end of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>However, at the end of the pa.s.sage, there was an even larger pa.s.sage. The pa.s.sage that Lu Ming was in just now was just a branch.</p><p>The two paths converged.</p><p>Lu Ming was directly thrown into this larger pa.s.sage.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The larger pa.s.sage was at least a few thousand meters in diameter, and it was filled with endless gales that blew in one direction.</p><p>It was because of this wind that the air current was able to produce such a terrifying attractive force.</p><p>The endless Gale blew on Lu Ming’s body. It was like a sharp blade cutting into Lu Ming’s body, causing him to feel a sharp pain.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly circulated the power of domination all over his body to resist the attack of the strong wind.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The strong wind whistled as Lu Ming was carried by the strong wind and flew towards the front of the pa.s.sage at an extreme speed. In the blink of an eye, he had flown hundreds of miles.</p><p>“No, I can’t keep being carried around like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He mustered all his strength and rushed to the side of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>The side of the pa.s.sage was full of uneven rocks. When Lu Ming was near the side of the pa.s.sage, he grabbed a protruding rock and finally stabilized himself.</p><p>there’s a hurricane tunnel in the depths of this cave. Where does it lead to? ”</p><p>Lu Ming started to think.</p><p>Could it be that the true core of the cave abode was in the depths of the pa.s.sage, and he had to pa.s.s through the hurricane pa.s.sage to reach it?</p><p>This was highly possible!</p><p>Many experts would set up formations or traps around their cave abodes to block others.</p><p>This Hurricane pa.s.sage was most likely set up by the owner of the cave.</p><p>“Follow the side of the pa.s.sage and go in to take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming had made up his mind. He did not want to give up and came here.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming walked along the side of the pa.s.sage and climbed up the protruding rocks, slowly heading deeper into the pa.s.sage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that the closer he got to the depths of the pa.s.sage, the stronger the wind was. It was very energy-consuming for Lu Ming to resist the power of the hurricane.</p><p>Every once in a while, Lu Ming would stop to rest and recover his energy.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming walked for three days and still did not reach the end of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>This tunnel seemed to be endless.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard a beast’s roar.</p><p>“Beast roar? What’s going on? are there still desolate beasts or divine beasts here?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look on his face. However, at the next moment, his eyes widened.</p><p>That was because he saw a huge wild beast soaring in the hurricane and flying toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a strange desolate beast. Its body was like an eagle and was covered in green feathers. However, its head was that of a Lion.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s first time seeing such a dire beast with the head of a Lion and the body of a bird.</p><p>This wild beast was completely unafraid of the strong wind. It flapped its wings and flew against the wind. Its eyes were like lightning as it swept its gaze over Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>It flapped its wings a few times and flew towards Lu Ming at top speed. Its sharp claws grabbed at Lu Ming in the air. The force whistled and its sharpness was terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He grabbed the rock with one hand and held the meteor spear in the other. He thrust the spear forward.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The meteor spear struck the sharp claws of his opponent, and the sound of metal clashing rang out. The lion-headed Eagle beast was sent flying, but Lu Ming’s long spear also trembled violently, causing Lu Ming’s arm to go numb.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not dare to be careless.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The lion-headed Eagle beast retreated and spread its wings to stabilize its body. Its eyes were even colder.</p><p>With a flap of its wings, its body was like a gust of wind as it charged at Lu Ming. Its wings were like blades, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in one hand and shot out rays of spear radiance as he fought the lion-headed Eagle beast.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides had exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming thrust his spear at the lion-headed Eagle beast’s lower abdomen. The lion-headed Eagle beast roared in anger and retreated frantically. Feathers fell all over the sky, and it was swept away by the hurricane, disappearing at the end of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The lion-headed Eagle-bodied beast was incomparably enraged. It roared continuously, and its wings flapped rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Wind blades, sharper than ordinary divine artifacts, were formed and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming activated the double combat strength of the battle formula.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming could trigger the double combat strength of the battle formula almost twice.</p><p>After activating the double combat power, his strength increased greatly. With a shake of his long spear, he shot out over a hundred spear lights, destroying the wind blades one by one.</p><p>At the same time, the long spear swept out with the wind, sweeping towards the lion-headed Eagle beast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack was already astonishingly fast to begin with. Now that he was moving along with the wind, his speed became even faster. The lion-headed Eagle beast wanted to Dodge, but it was already too late. It was struck by the long spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The lion-headed Eagle beast exploded.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, after the lion-headed Eagle beast exploded, there was not a single drop of blood. It turned into energy and disappeared.</p><p>“It’s fake and not a real living being?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also stunned. Could it be that this was condensed by the big array?</p><p>However, the lion-headed Eagle beast was too real. It was no different from the real thing. Lu Ming could not tell just now.</p><p>After killing the lion-headed Eagle-bodied beast, Lu Ming continued to move forward from the side.</p><p>However, they didn’t go far before they heard a few more roars.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw the lion-headed Eagle beast.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn’t just one this time, but three.</p><p>The three Lion-headed Eagle-bodied beasts pounced at Lu Ming the moment they saw him.</p><p>“Then let’s fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He brandished his long spear and engaged the three-headed Lion-headed Eagle beast in close combat.</p><p>This time, they exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>In the hurricane tunnel, Lu Ming had to resist the strong wind and it was difficult for him to exert his full strength. On the other hand, the lion-headed Eagle beast was like a fish in water, able to exert its full strength.</p><p>Therefore, even though the lion-headed Eagle beast’s level was not high, Lu Ming still spent a lot of effort to kill it.</p><p>“It’s not bad to use this environment to train myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>In such an adverse situation, Lu Ming had to go all out to fight the lion-headed Eagle beast. He had to exert his dominant power and the battle character formula to the extreme.</p><p>After the previous exchange of blows, Lu Ming felt that he had gained some understanding of the ruler and the battle character formula.</p><p>Although it wasn’t much, it was still much faster than dry and bitter cultivation.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming found a larger protruding rock and used it to stabilize his body. He then circulated his cultivation technique to recover.</p><p>Every time he used the double combat power of the battle formula, he had to rest and recover. It was impossible to use it continuously.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming had fully recovered. He then continued to head deeper into the pa.s.sage. However, he had not gone far when a few more Lion-headed Eagle-bodied beasts appeared and fought with Lu Ming.</p><p>After another hundred moves, the lion-headed Eagle beast was finally killed. Lu Ming had gained more understanding of the Dao of domination and the battle formula.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
