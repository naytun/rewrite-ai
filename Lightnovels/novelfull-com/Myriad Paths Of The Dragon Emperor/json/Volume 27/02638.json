Those that were ranked lower might not necessarily have no ‘gold’.</p><p>In history, such a situation had also occurred.</p><p>Some people’s performance during the test was average and weren’t selected by the Qin heavenly thirteen clans. Instead, they joined a small power.</p><p>However, later on, there were some who soared to the heavens and rose up against the heavens. They became heavenly deities, G.o.dkings, and even became the top experts of the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>Once they found such ‘gold’, that small power would make a fortune.</p><p>Many geniuses who weren’t chosen by the Qin heavenly thirteen clans would join these small factions.</p><p>Compared to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, these small powers were undoubtedly Leviathan powers.</p><p>Some forces had G.o.dkings holding down the fort.</p><p>After a while, the 20 screens in the sky disappeared.</p><p>Instead, it was replaced by lines of words.</p><p>At that moment, a message popped up in the Jade talismans of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>It was the information and rules of the second round of a.s.sessment.</p><p>Everyone looked at it carefully.</p><p>The rules of the second round of the a.s.sessment were also in the dream s.p.a.ce. Furthermore, just like the first round, everyone’s cultivation was suppressed to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>In the dream s.p.a.ce, they could only use the incomplete divine skills they had comprehended.</p><p>Moreover, the second round was a one-on-one battle on the arena.</p><p>The top 100 in each of the 20 regions, a total of 2000 people, would fight in pairs.</p><p>However, the premise was that they had a month of rest.</p><p>A month later, they would enter the forest of stone steles where they had comprehended the incomplete divine skill last time and comprehend it again.</p><p>This time, it would be two years.</p><p>The second round would only begin two years later.</p><p>It was obvious that this was to further widen the gap between those with talent and comprehension.</p><p>The Qin heaven 13 clans were only interested in their comprehension and talent.</p><p>During the process of the arena battles, experts from the Qin heavenly thirteen clans would descend and observe their battles. If they were satisfied, they would even take the initiative to invite them.</p><p>What was different from the first round was that during the two years they were comprehending the incomplete divine skill, they could exit at any time and could also enter at any time, so they had much more freedom.</p><p>there’s still a month of maintenance. Shall we go out for a walk? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Everyone naturally agreed.</p><p>Everyone walked out of the inn and strolled on the streets.</p><p>At the same time, they were on myriad spirit planet, the largest commercial planet in the Qin heaven Star Zone. Lu Ming had a few other goals.</p><p>Back then, he had obtained some divine pills in the deity’s cave abode on the northern Shang planet. He wanted to find some books that introduced divine pills and identify them.</p><p>In addition, he had quite a few divine artifacts on hand. He planned to sell some of them and then buy a batch of divine artifact fragments for QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>As QiuQiu’s level increased, his requirements for divine artifact fragments also became higher and higher.</p><p>The low-level divine artifact fragments were becoming less and less useful to it.</p><p>He needed to buy some high-level divine artifact fragments.</p><p>Besides, Lu Ming also wanted to see if he could find any secret skills that could conceal the power of domination so that others would not be able to recognize it easily.</p><p>“You guys go ahead, I still have things to do, so I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>After strolling around for a while, Xie nianjun spoke and left from another street.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not think too much about it. Xie nianjun had always been mysterious.</p><p>They continued to stroll around, and not long after, they arrived at a bustling area.</p><p>This area was filled with shops.</p><p>This was the Qin heaven star region’s largest business star. Caravans from the various galaxies of the Qin heaven star region truly had everything.</p><p>The crowd was dazzled. Some of the treasures made them envious, but they were shockingly expensive. Even some true G.o.ds and heavenly G.o.ds couldn’t afford them, let alone them.</p><p>They strolled around for a while and came to a shop selling divine artifacts. Lu Ming sold a few Level Seven low-grade divine artifacts and level eight low-grade divine artifacts, then exchanged them for some divine artifact fragments of the same level.</p><p>After that, they went to some shops that sold divine skills and secret techniques.</p><p>“So many divine skills and some secret skills!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s eyes were shining.</p><p>On the other hand, Xie nianqing’s expression was calm.</p><p>At a glance, he saw at least a few hundred divine skills.</p><p>Attack type, speed type, and defense type.</p><p>However, the high price made them gasp.</p><p>In addition, there were even secret techniques.</p><p>Secret techniques were different from divine skills.</p><p>Secret skills were usually even rarer. They were used for auxiliary purposes. Some could be used to a.s.sist in attack, speed, alchemy, weapon refinement, and so on.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at them one by one.</p><p>Of course, there was no real copy here. It was just an introduction.</p><p>Only when they took a fancy to it and wanted to buy it would the shop owner take out the real book.</p><p>“What a mystical secret technique …”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that some secret skills could increase one’s combat strength in a short period of time, just like the battle formula. However, unlike the battle formula, there were no side effects. These secret skills usually had side effects.</p><p>Some could increase one’s speed, while some required special cultivation methods to increase one’s combat strength.</p><p>However, the price was usually astonishingly high.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current status, he could not afford it.</p><p>“Soul transformation!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he saw a secret skill.</p><p>The soul transformation technique could change the aura, color, and level of divine power.</p><p>The introduction was very simple but it was suitable for Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the price tag was 100000 divine crystals. Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>100,000 divine gems was a very low price compared to other secret skills, but it was not a small amount.</p><p>“Sir, do you need this secret skill?”</p><p>A shop a.s.sistant asked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Can the price of this soul transformation technique be a little cheaper?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Cheaper? I can’t make this decision, I need to ask the manager. Wait a moment, I’ll go ask the manager!”</p><p>The shopkeeper said politely and left in a hurry. After a while, the palace came back with a middle-aged man.</p><p>Sir, you need this soul formation technique. How about this? I’ll sell it to you for 80000 divine crystals. Let’s be friends!</p><p>The shopkeeper said with a smile.</p><p>“80000 divine crystals is too expensive. I’ll buy it for 50000 divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>50000, Sir. I’m afraid that’s not possible. It’s too cheap!</p><p>The shopkeeper shook his head.</p><p>shopkeeper, I think you know that the soul-changing technique is not very useful for most people. No matter how long you stay here, I’m afraid no one will buy it. 50000 divine crystals is enough!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head casually, looking as if he did not care.</p><p>Indeed, this divine transformation spell was completely different from the divine breath spell that Lu Ming had obtained in the past.</p><p>The divine breath technique could change one’s aura as if he was a different person. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was too high now and the divine breath technique was no longer useful.</p><p>The soul s.n.a.t.c.hing spell could only change the aura, level, color, and so on of the divine power.</p><p>But why would an ordinary person change their divine power level?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
