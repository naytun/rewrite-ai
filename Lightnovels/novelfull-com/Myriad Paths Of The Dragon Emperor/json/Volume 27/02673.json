After a long while, he sighed.</p><p>reincarnation has countless risks. If you can’t awaken, you’ll be trapped in reincarnation forever until you die!</p><p>it’s already very fortunate that the second young lady has awakened. At least, she still has the memories of her previous life!</p><p>The grey-robed old man sighed.</p><p>He had lived for a long time and had seen many people reincarnate. However, only one in ten thousand people could truly be reincarnated and awaken. Most of them had sunk into eternal oblivion.</p><p>There were also many people like Xie nianqing who were too obsessed with this life and eventually decided to take control of it. This way, the reincarnation was only half successful.</p><p>It was rare to see someone like Xie nianjun who had fully awakened!</p><p>moreover, she has a family now. She has a son and a granddaughter …</p><p>Then, Xie nianjun told him about Xie nianqing and Lu Ming’s situation.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they waited.</p><p>Not long after, a figure floated in. It was Xie nianqing.</p><p>“You are …”</p><p>When Xie nianqing saw the grey-robed old man, her delicate body trembled and her face turned pale.</p><p>“Hong Yang pays his respects to the second young lady!”</p><p>The grey-robed old man bowed to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Hong …”</p><p>Xie nianqing said softly. He originally wanted to call him uncle Hong, but after a moment of silence, he changed his words, ” “Senior, you don’t have to be so polite. My name is Xie nianqing now, not Tang Qing!”</p><p>you are the reincarnation of the second young lady’s soul. No matter which lifetime you are in control of, you are the second young lady in my heart!</p><p>The gray-robed elder bowed.</p><p>“Senior, why have you come?”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Xie nianqing, we should leave. This is not a place for us to stay!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“Leave? No, I won’t leave!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shook his head, his expression firm.</p><p>I’m not leaving, Xie nianqing. Our cultivation is too slow here. Only by leaving can we improve quickly …</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>if my cultivation is slow, then I’ll just slowly improve! Xie nianqing continued to shake his head.</p><p>Xie nianqing, are you really going to abandon the Tang family just like that? in your past life, you were the second miss of the Tang family, Tang Qing. Don’t forget that they are in danger now!</p><p>Xie nianjun’s voice grew louder.</p><p>Xie nianqing frowned. There seemed to be some struggle between his brows, but he did not speak.</p><p>moreover, there are some things that will only be difficult if the two of us work together. Moreover, father’s whereabouts are currently unknown. Only if we work together can we find him. Only if we find father will we have hope. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s voice grew louder as he pressed on.</p><p>The ‘father’ she was referring to was naturally not Xie Qitian from the Xie family of the divine wilderness continent, but her ‘father’ from her previous life.</p><p>“I … I’m Xie nianqing!”</p><p>The struggle between Xie nianqing’s brows became more intense. Finally, he shouted as if he wanted to strengthen his belief.</p><p>I know that you are Xie nianqing. I also know that you can’t bear to leave Lu Ming, Lu shenhuang, and Lu Chi. However, if you stay, you will only bring harm to them!</p><p>you should know very well how terrifying and powerful our enemies are. You are Tang Qing’s soul. Just based on this, you will be discovered by them sooner or later!</p><p>“The Qin heaven Star Zone is located in a remote area. It’s still alright. However, with Lu Ming’s talent, do you think he will stay in the Qin heaven Star Zone forever? With his talent, he will leave the Qin heaven star region sooner or later. At that time, if you come into contact with those people, your ident.i.ty will be discovered sooner or later!”</p><p>“You’re the daughter of ‘taboo’. They won’t let you off. They won’t let Lu Ming and the rest off either. No matter how talented Lu Ming is, he won’t be able to fight back when facing those people. I believe you’re very clear about this. Otherwise, why didn’t you dare to tell Lu Ming anything? you’re afraid of implicating them!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said as he stared into Xie nianqing’s eyes.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes became fl.u.s.tered.</p><p>Xie nianqing, I’ve said everything I need to say. It’s up to you to decide. Today’s separation doesn’t mean that you’ll never see each other again. If you find father, you’ll still see each other!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go with you!”</p><p>After some struggle, Xie nianqing finally spoke again, his eyes filled with determination.</p><p>Xie nianjun smiled.</p><p>but I have to go and say goodbye to Lu Ming!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“I’ll send you there. Just point me to the location!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder said. Then, he waved his hand and disappeared with Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun. In the next moment, they reappeared in Lu Ming’s courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed Xie nianqing and the rest the moment they appeared.</p><p>Although he was cultivating, he had left a trace of spiritual sense to keep an eye on his surroundings.</p><p>“Xiao Qing and Xie nianjun, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He ended his cultivation and walked out of the room.</p><p>When Lu Ming walked out of the room and his gaze fell on the gray-robed elder, his pupils could not help but shrink.</p><p>He had never thought that there would be a third person.</p><p>Just now, he only sensed Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s auras. He didn’t sense the gray-robed elder’s aura at all. It was as if he was just air.</p><p>Unfathomable!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s first impression of the gray-robed elder.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me introduce you. This is uncle Hong …”</p><p>Xie nianjun was the first to speak.</p><p>“Uncle Hong …”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned.</p><p>Xie nianjun called him uncle Hong so affectionately, so he must be very close to him.</p><p>This was the primal universe, so this elder naturally couldn’t be from the primordial realm’s divine wilderness continent’s Xie family. It went without saying that this person was someone Xie nianjun knew in his previous life.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the junior generation greets the senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>you’re the second young lady’s husband in this life. You’re indeed a Dragon among men!</p><p>The gray-robed elder sized Lu Ming up, as if he could see through all of Lu Ming’s secrets. He continued, alright, you guys continue chatting. I’ll leave first!</p><p>With that, the gray-robed elder’s body disappeared. Lu Ming could not even tell how he disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked to Lu Ming’s side and muttered to himself, ” “I’m going to leave …”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and his expression changed slightly. “Leave? Little Qing, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>“There are some things that I need to do. But don’t worry, I’ll be back soon!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Where are you going? I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m afraid you can’t help with this!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and asked.</p><p>to tell you the truth, Xie nianqing and I were both from the Tang family in our previous lives. However, the Tang family is facing a huge crisis. My father has gone missing and we need Xie nianqing and me to find him. You are too weak to help!</p><p>moreover, our cultivation will only improve rapidly after we leave. It’s only a matter of time before we return to our previous lives. We can’t unleash our potential here!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
