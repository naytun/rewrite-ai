As long as one cultivated it to an extremely high level, one would be able to cultivate a high-level divine power.</p><p>It was said that when the three Overlord forces ‘divine techniques were cultivated to the highest level, they could cultivate divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Thus, if a person’s Shen power level was not high but his comprehension was amazing, his future would be limitless.</p><p>Of course, there were some people who did not cultivate these divine skills and naturally cultivated high-level Shen power, and there were many of them.</p><p>Lu Ming, Tong Xi ‘er, and the others were all like this.</p><p>Of the disciples that the Qin heavenly thirteen clans wanted to recruit, one had to have a high level of divine power, while the other had to have extraordinary comprehension.</p><p>also, let me tell you all. Some of you came from some major powers and might have already cultivated some incomplete divine skills. However, in the dream s.p.a.ce, you are not allowed to use the incomplete divine skills that you have already cultivated. You can only use the incomplete divine skills that you have comprehended in the dream s.p.a.ce. Once you violate this rule, you will be eliminated. The Qin heavenly thirteen clans will never recruit you again. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Many people shouted.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll stop here. Good luck!”</p><p>Then, the middle-aged man and the others turned around and left.</p><p>After the middle-aged man and the rest left, the rest of the people in the square also slowly dispersed. Lu Ming and the rest also returned to their lodgings.</p><p>Not long after he returned to his residence, a large amount of information appeared on the Jade token. It was all about the a.s.sessment and some rules.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked at it carefully again and then made preparations actively.</p><p>There were only three days left before the a.s.sessment began. Not only them, but everyone else was actively preparing for it.</p><p>A group of people stood in a huge courtyard. They were all tall and burly, as if they were made of metal.</p><p>These people were a branch of the king Kong race, a terrifying race in the primeval universe.</p><p>The Vajra race was a very powerful race in the primeval universe. It ranked in the top 10000 among the countless races in the primeval universe.</p><p>There was a list of 10000 races in the primeval universe, which listed the 10000 most powerful races in the primeval universe. The diamond Race was one of them.</p><p>However, the main clan of the king Kong race wasn’t in the Qin heaven Star Domain. The Qin heaven Star Domain was only a branch.</p><p>At this moment, dozens of Vajra race members were surrounding a young Vajra race member like stars surrounding the moon.</p><p>This young Vajra race man was even more burly and was three meters tall.</p><p>Golden Sage, you’re a rare genius that only appears once every 100000 years in the Qin Tian branch of the king Kong race. This time, you must rank in the top three in the Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment and join one of the three overlords!</p><p>An elderly King Kong ordered.</p><p>don’t worry, clan leader. It’s just the top three. I’m 100% confident!</p><p>The Golden Sage said with a confident smile.</p><p>On a mountain in Wanling city, this place had been bought by a group of Tigermen.</p><p>The Tigermen tribe was only a small tribe in the entire primeval universe. They were far from being ranked in the top 10000. However, in the Qin heaven Star Zone, the Tigermen tribe’s strength could not be underestimated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, a young Tigerman roared towards the sky. The wind and clouds surged, and his aura was wild.</p><p>“This time, the top three, no, I’m aiming for the first place!”</p><p>The young Tigerman’s eyes were like lightning, and he was filled with the aura of a King.</p><p>To the North of Wanling city, there was a Lake. It was not big, but it was very clean. It was like a mirror, and one could clearly see the fish in the lake.</p><p>There was a simple Pavilion by the lake.</p><p>At this moment, there were two figures in the pavilion, looking at the calm lake.</p><p>One of them was a white-haired old man in a long white robe. He looked like a Sage.</p><p>The other person was a young man who looked to be in his twenties. This young man was handsome and was also wearing a white robe, like an elegant young master.</p><p>“Ye ‘er, are you confident about this time’s Qin Tian thirteen clan examination?”</p><p>The old man asked the young man.</p><p>The young man was called Linghu ye!</p><p>“According to the rules this time, I’m 100% confident that the first place will be mine!”</p><p>Linghu ye said. His face was calm, without any pride, as if he was just stating a fact.</p><p>good. With your talent, as long as you give it your all, the first place will definitely be yours. Moreover, you’ll definitely be able to enter the three Overlord forces and even receive special training!</p><p>The white-haired old man stroked his beard and looked at Linghu ye with satisfaction.</p><p>If they did not enter the dream s.p.a.ce and fought outside, Linghu ye would not have such an advantage.</p><p>However, the rules this time gave him one year to comprehend and cultivate an incomplete divine skill, which was Linghu ye’s biggest advantage.</p><p>Linghu ye’s comprehension was the strongest that the old man had seen in countless years. Although Linghu ye’s divine power level was not high, it was because he lacked opportunities and divine skills. However, Linghu ye’s terrifying comprehension could make up for it.</p><p>&Nbsp; the old man was filled with antic.i.p.ation. As long as Linghu ye joined the three Overlord forces and was nurtured, he would definitely be able to reach a terrifying realm.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days pa.s.sed.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er were gathered in a room. They sat cross-legged in a circle.</p><p>There was no need to go to a specific place to partic.i.p.ate in the a.s.sessment. As long as they were in Wanling city, the ident.i.ty Jade card would bring them into the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Wuwuwuwu …</p><p>At that moment, the Jade tokens in Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the others ‘hands trembled slightly. They emitted a bright light and floated above their heads.</p><p>Then, a beam of light fell from the Jade token and enveloped them.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the rest felt that their spirits and souls had been drawn out and flew into the Jade card. It was pitch black in front of them.</p><p>Almost instantly, their eyes lit up as they opened their eyes.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>When they opened their eyes, they found that they were on a huge platform, and in front of the platform was a stone tablet.</p><p>Countless stone tablets stood on the vast land.</p><p>Each stone tablet was a hundred meters tall, and there were some words and pictures carved on each stone tablet.</p><p>There were too many steles. There was no end to them.</p><p>“Is the incomplete divine skill on this stone tablet?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>They were going to stay here for a year to comprehend and cultivate the incomplete divine skill.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
