In the blink of an eye, three months had pa.s.sed.</p><p>After three months, they still had not reached the end of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>There were two main reasons for this.</p><p>First, the pa.s.sage was too long.</p><p>The second reason was that Lu Ming’s progress was very slow. Every time he advanced a certain distance, he would encounter the lion-headed Eagle-bodied beast. Naturally, his progress would be slower.</p><p>There was even one time when Lu Ming encountered more than ten Lion-headed Eagle-bodied beasts appearing at the same time. Lu Ming was no match for them and could only retreat against the wind.</p><p>Fortunately, the lion-headed Eagle beast seemed to have its own territory. When Lu Ming retreated to a certain area, the other party did not pursue him.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to fight the lion-headed Eagle beast.</p><p>After three months, the palace Master and the experts of the yuanluo Palace finally broke the formation of the outermost gate.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The door opened, and the palace Master and the others rushed in excitedly.</p><p>They fantasized that there would be a large number of treasures waiting for them.</p><p>However, it was as if a basin of cold water had been poured on them.</p><p>Nothing, there was nothing!</p><p>They searched every corner, but it was empty. There was nothing.</p><p>The palace master’s face darkened.</p><p>Naturally, they had also searched for the pa.s.sageway that Lu Ming had entered previously. However, the gap had been blocked by QiuQiu. They had only scanned the area casually and naturally did not discover it.</p><p>Soon, they came to the depths and were blocked by the second door.</p><p>Palace Master, there’s another door here. Perhaps, the area we’re in now is only the periphery of the cave abode, so there’s no treasure here. We might be able to obtain an opportunity through this door!</p><p>The Grand Elder of the yuanluo Palace, mo kan, said.</p><p>“That’s right, the treasure must be hidden inside!”</p><p>“As long as we break through this door, we’ll definitely be able to obtain the treasure!”</p><p>The others from the yuanluo Palace also chimed in.</p><p>The palace master’s expression eased a little. alright, then let’s join forces and break this door. When we get the treasures, I will definitely not mistreat you!</p><p>“Many thanks, Hall Master!”</p><p>The others expressed their grat.i.tude and joined forces to attack the door.</p><p>However, the moment they made their move, their expressions turned ugly.</p><p>This was because the strength of this gate’s array was much stronger than the first gate.</p><p>The first door had taken them several months to break open. This door would probably take even longer.</p><p>But now, they were helpless and could only grit their teeth and attack!</p><p>In the sky above the righteous Army, the ancestor of technique and Fu Heng were still playing chess.</p><p>What they were playing wasn’t a real game of chess. It contained cultivation and wisdom. Every move was a contest between the two of them, and it would take a long time.</p><p>They were still playing chess with all their might.</p><p>In the hurricane tunnel, Lu Ming was still moving forward slowly, fighting with the lion-headed Eagle beast.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming entered the hurricane pa.s.sageway. Eight months had pa.s.sed.</p><p>After eight months of continuous killing, Lu Ming had made great progress in all aspects.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that his cultivation level had reached the limit of a five-star heavenly Emperor and he could break through.</p><p>I’ve been fighting and tempering myself here. My cultivation has indeed improved very quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>If he were to cultivate step by step outside, even in such a good environment like the desolate universe, Lu Ming would need at least five years before he could break through.</p><p>And this was under the premise that he had Jing Yu’s portrait to study.</p><p>However, in less than a year, Lu Ming felt that he could break through.</p><p>I have to find a better place to break through. Along the way, I saw some pits, but I have to break through in those pits!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The walls here were uneven, and there were often some potholes, like shallow caves. It was a very good hiding place.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward. After a few more rounds of fighting, Lu Ming finally found a pit.</p><p>After entering the pit, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to regulate his breathing.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming had recovered to his peak state. He took out a pile of divine crystals and started to break through.</p><p>The breakthrough this time was smooth without any difficulty.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming successfully became a six-star heavenly Emperor. The price he paid was that he had to consume over ten thousand divine crystals.</p><p>After becoming a six-star heavenly Emperor, Lu Ming’s abilities had become stronger.</p><p>However, the further one advanced in the virtual G.o.d Realm, the greater the gap between each level. It was getting harder and harder for him to break through in the heavenly Emperor realm and fight across levels.</p><p>If he did not use the battle character formula, Lu Ming could only fight against a fourth-level void G.o.d-level powerhouse at most with the path of domination.</p><p>After successfully breaking through, Lu Ming continued to advance and fought the lion-headed Eagle-bodied beast to temper himself.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the hurricane pa.s.sageway for one year and three months.</p><p>At this moment, the yuanluo Hall Master and the others were still blocked by the second door and could not break the formation.</p><p>“Hall Master, bad news!”</p><p>At this moment, an expert from the yuanluo Palace came in and reported.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall asked with a dark expression.</p><p>He was in a bad mood. He had been here for more than a year, but he had not gained anything.</p><p>If this went on, when Fu Heng couldn’t hold the ancestor of technique back anymore, it would be troublesome.</p><p>“Palace Master, the free and unfettered sect’s sect master is here with his men!”</p><p>An expert from the yuanluo Palace reported.</p><p>“That old fellow situ …”</p><p>The yuanluo Palace Master gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Brother Kang, you’re too unkind. There’s an expert’s cave here, and you want to take it for yourself without even informing me!”</p><p>At this time, a cold and faint voice rang out, and a group of people rushed in.</p><p>The one in the lead was a skinny middle-aged man. This man was the leader of the Footloose sect, situ haonan.</p><p>“Brother situ, you’ve misunderstood me. There’s a formation blocking this place. I was going to break the formation and inform you!”</p><p>The palace Master of the yuanluo Palace said with a fake smile.</p><p>“Notify me when the formation is broken?”</p><p>Situ haonan laughed coldly and said, ” brother Kang, no matter what, we’re in an Alliance. We’ve worked together to deal with the righteous Army. My carefree sect has helped you hold back many of the righteous Army’s experts, which is why you have the opportunity to occupy this cave dwelling. So, my carefree sect will also have a share of this cave dwelling. Brother Kang, do you have any objections? ”</p><p>“How many do you want?”</p><p>The yuan Luo Palace Master said.</p><p>half. We’ll split the treasures inside!</p><p>Situ haonan said.</p><p>“Half?”</p><p>The palace master’s face darkened. “Brother situ, your appet.i.te is too big!”</p><p>“Too big? He he he!”</p><p>Hmph! situ haonan sneered. if I turn around and leave now and lure fa Ming here, I’m afraid you won’t even get half of it!</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The palace master’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>Everything was about benefits!</p><p>The yuan Luo Palace and the Walkabout sect had only joined forces for the sake of profit.</p><p>Now that an expert’s cave abode was in front of them, their relationship was not as friendly.</p><p>He had no doubt that if he refused, situ haonan would do anything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
