On the badge was a picture of a ruin that was made of Jade.</p><p>This was their symbol.</p><p>People who came from different galaxies all had a badge with a different pattern on their chest.</p><p>“There’s no change in my cultivation!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming carefully sensed his body and realized that his cultivation level had not changed at all. He was still a seven-star Celestial Emperor, and the power of domination was surging.</p><p>Of course, their weapons and storage rings could not be brought in.</p><p>In reality, weapons were not allowed in this compet.i.tion. If one wanted to use a weapon, they would have to use divine power and rely on their own abilities.</p><p>“Is your cultivation base being suppressed?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, Tong Xi ‘er, and dandan.</p><p>I’ve been suppressed to the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, but my divine power level hasn’t changed!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er also nodded.</p><p>“There’s no change in mine!”</p><p>Dandan said. His cultivation was at the first level of the void G.o.d Realm, so there was no change.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was indeed the same as what the rules said.</p><p>At this moment, on the platform, many people flashed and rushed toward the stone tablets.</p><p>Time was limited. They only had a year’s time.</p><p>A year’s time to comprehend an incomplete divine skill was too short!</p><p>They had to seize the time to find an incomplete divine skill that was suitable for them and cultivate it.</p><p>With every moment he cultivated, he might be able to reach a higher level of maturity. When he fought with others, he would have an advantage.</p><p>Millions of people rushed into the vast stone tablets, looking for a divine skill that suited them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also rushed down the platform and headed for the stone tablet.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the first huge stone tablet.</p><p>At this moment, two young men were already looking at the stone tablet carefully.</p><p>On the stone tablet, there were lines of words and pictures.</p><p>This was a palm technique that leaned towards the feminine side. Lu Ming and the rest took a few glances and then directly ignored it.</p><p>It was not suitable!</p><p>They continued forward.</p><p>As they walked, they attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>The two sisters, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun, were simply too beautiful when they walked together. The two of them looked exactly the same, and it was hard not to attract attention.</p><p>“What beautiful women, and they look exactly the same!”</p><p>“Look at their badges, they are from the chaotic astral River. I never thought that there would be such a beautiful woman in the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>“Who is that person? He’s actually walking together with such a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Many people around them were discussing as they looked at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun with fiery eyes.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er could be considered a stunning beauty, but when she stood next to Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun, she paled in comparison.</p><p>Ever since Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun broke through to the BattleG.o.d realm, their temperament had become more and more extraordinary. Even people with similar looks could not compare to them.</p><p>When many people looked at Lu Ming, they were filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>Although dandan was still following Lu Ming, she looked like a sixteen or seventeen-year-old teenager and was wearing a Daoist robe. Naturally, she was ignored by the others.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s faces were cold. They ignored the gazes of others and focused on finding a suitable divine skill.</p><p>“What beautiful women!”</p><p>Not far away, a dozen burly figures were looking at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun with fiery eyes.</p><p>These dozen over people were all elites of the Tiger clan.</p><p>The Tigermen did not have the appearance of a Tiger from head to toe.</p><p>They looked very similar to humans, but they had stripes on their faces. They were tiger stripes.</p><p>Each of them was more than two meters tall and had thick hair.</p><p>how can I miss such a beauty? let’s go and get to know her!</p><p>One of the tiger-men youths with golden fur laughed and walked towards Lu Ming and the others. The other dozen or so tiger-men youths laughed and followed.</p><p>Their figures flickered and more than ten Tigermen youths blocked Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest also stopped.</p><p>The dozen or so young men from the Tiger Tribe scanned Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er with burning eyes.</p><p>“Chaotic astral River? I didn’t expect that there would be such a beauty in the chaotic astral River. We are the heaven’s pride of the Tiger clan. My name is Hu Mao. Beautiful lady, how about we be friends?”</p><p>The Golden-furred Tigermen youth revealed a confident smile.</p><p>Lu Ming, dandan, and the rest almost burst out laughing.</p><p>Tiger fur?</p><p>This name was quite ‘profound’.</p><p>However, Xie nianjun didn’t want to laugh. With a cold expression, she scolded, ” “Get lost!”</p><p>aiyoyoo, you have a strong temper. However, my Tiger clan likes people with strong tempers the most. Brothers, don’t you? ”</p><p>Hu Mao didn’t mind and teased him instead.</p><p>“Not bad, the fiercer the temper, the better. It’s fun to play with!”</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The other young Tigermen laughed.</p><p>At the side, the other people looked over with an expression of watching a show.</p><p>“I already told you to get lost, didn’t you hear me? Are you deaf or what? Get lost immediately!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming berated.</p><p>The smile on the Tiger youth’s face instantly disappeared, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>“A mere piece of trash from the chaotic astral River dares to speak to us like this? are you tired of living?”</p><p>I’ll give you three seconds to get lost. Get as far away as you can. What right do you have to stand next to two beautiful women? ”</p><p>The dozen or so young men of the Tiger Tribe all roared as their bodies flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully, counting the time for Xie nianqing. Three seconds later, Lu Ming stepped forward and held Xie nianqing’s hand. He said in disdain,”A bunch of idiots!”</p><p>Provocation, disdain, and mockery!</p><p>This was a blatant mockery.</p><p>Killing intent exploded from the bodies of the Tigermen youths.</p><p>kid, kneel down and admit your mistake. Slap yourself a hundred times. Otherwise, I’ll make you die without a burial place!</p><p>The Tiger was furious and revealed its uneven fangs.</p><p>“Oh? If you have the ability, then do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Hu Mao and the other young men of the Tiger Tribe glared at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>However, they did not dare to make a move!</p><p>The a.s.sessment had not started yet. During this one year of comprehending and cultivating the incomplete divine skill, no one was allowed to make a move. Whoever made a move would be disqualified.</p><p>If not for that, Hu Mao and the rest would have long torn Lu Ming into pieces!</p><p>kid, you’ve got guts. Just you wait. Don’t meet anyone from my Tiger Tribe in the a.s.sessment one year from now. Otherwise, you’ll die a terrible death!</p><p>Hu Mao spoke coldly before turning to the other Tigermen, ” brothers, go and inform the other clan members. If they meet this person in the a.s.sessment, kill him without mercy! Kill him ruthlessly!</p><p>“Alright, there are so many people in my Tiger Tribe. He’s dead for sure!”</p><p>“He’ll die a terrible death!”</p><p>The other Tigermen all called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
