The young man in the lead was tall and strong. He was even taller than the Tiger bone and had a domineering aura.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>A few young men from the Tiger Tribe stopped in front of Lu Ming. The young man in the lead spoke coldly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded.</p><p>very good. In the 20th region, you killed many of my Tiger tribe’s experts. You’d better not meet me in the second round. Otherwise, I’ll make you die a miserable death!</p><p>The Tigermen youth in the lead said ferociously as killing intent burst out from his eyes.</p><p>“This brat from the chaotic astral River has actually offended the Tiger-Man Tribe. He’s finished!”</p><p>“Now that Hu ya has his eyes on him, I’m afraid he won’t have an easy time in the second round!”</p><p>At the side, some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>“Hu ya, you’re really becoming more and more useless. You’ve actually set your eyes on a person from the chaotic astral River. Your opponent is me!”</p><p>Hu ya! at this time, a rough voice sounded. A young man who was even stronger than Hu ya stepped out, and his powerful aura pressed down on Hu ya.</p><p>“Golden Sage, it’s the Golden Sage!”</p><p>Some people recognized this young man. He was as famous as Hu ya and was also a top genius who had mastered sacred grade divine power.</p><p>Golden Sage, you and I will have a battle one day. This time, the first place will belong to me!</p><p>Hu ya sneered.</p><p>“What a joke. You think you can get first place? The first place is mine!”</p><p>The Golden Saint faced off, and their auras collided. Divine power spread out from their bodies, and a terrifying sharpness flowed out.</p><p>the two of you are really narcissistic to the extreme. Do you think you’re worthy of the first place? ”</p><p>At this moment, a young man stepped out and formed a horn with Golden Saint and Hu ya.</p><p>Yang Chong!</p><p>He was another existence who controlled the divine power.</p><p>Golden Saint and Hu ya’s eyes turned serious.</p><p>“This test tests talent, comprehension, and combat experience. It’s not about having a high Shen power level that you can get first!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded. A young man from the human-snake hybrid clan stepped out and joined the confrontation.</p><p>that’s right. A high level of Shen power does not necessarily mean a high achievement in the future. As long as you have divine skills and wondrous methods, there are many who can catch up from behind!</p><p>Another young man walked out.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Following that, powerful auras burst forth as more and more Young heaven’s favorites joined in the fight. There were more than ten of them.</p><p>amazing! They’re all ranked first in their respective regions!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>These young men who had joined the confrontation were all ranked first in their respective regions in the first round. Each of them was full of confidence, arrogant, and conceited, not weaker than anyone else.</p><p>Not only these people, but also the second and third ranked people in their respective regions were full of confidence.</p><p>In the first round, the one with the highest points was not the strongest. Sometimes, luck was also needed. Some people with low points did not mean they were not strong.</p><p>These people were also full of fighting spirit and wanted to compete with the Golden Sage, Hu ya, and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled casually and took a few steps back. He could not be bothered to fight with these people.</p><p>It was useless to say anything now. He would naturally know when they fought two years later.</p><p>“Then Let’s Have a Battle two years later!”</p><p>Hu ya said coldly. Then, he glanced at Lu Ming coldly. In a flash, he led the geniuses of the Tiger clan and charged into the forest of stone steles.</p><p>Then, Golden Sage and the others also rushed into the stone stele Forest and disappeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After that, the others flashed and rushed toward the Stele Forest.</p><p>This time, there were only two thousand people, and they looked spa.r.s.e. In the blink of an eye, they entered the forest of stone steles.</p><p>However, different people had different choices.</p><p>Some people rushed into the stone stele Forest to find new and incomplete divine skills to cultivate.</p><p>For example, most people would choose an incomplete speed divine skill or an incomplete defense divine skill. When combined with an incomplete attack divine skill, the power would definitely be stronger.</p><p>However, in this way, comprehending several incomplete divine skills at the same time was bound to divide a lot of energy.</p><p>And some people directly pa.s.sed through the forest of stone steles and rushed into the other side of the forest of stone steles. They entered the training ground, looked for desolate beasts to kill, and focused on cultivating an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>As long as one cultivated an incomplete divine skill to an extremely high realm, its power would similarly be extremely shocking.</p><p>Everyone had their own choices.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the rest split up. Lu Ming wandered around the stone tablet forest.</p><p>Lu Ming also planned to choose an incomplete divine skill to cultivate.</p><p>His comprehension was high enough, and choosing one more was the best way.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming chose an incomplete speed-type divine skill.</p><p>This incomplete divine skill actually had a name.</p><p>ROC wing technique!</p><p>He had comprehended the great ROC’s flight and had evolved it. Once he used it, it was as if the great ROC had spread its wings, and his speed was astonishing.</p><p>Similarly, this incomplete divine skill was divided into seven levels.</p><p>Lu Ming began to study it carefully.</p><p>After more than a month, Lu Ming finally got the hang of it.</p><p>Lu Ming did not continue to cultivate after he entered the sect. He pa.s.sed through the forest of stone steles and came to the other side.</p><p>He wanted to enter the training ground and find desolate beasts to kill. This way, his cultivation speed would be the fastest.</p><p>On the other side of the Stele Forest, there were 72 huge caves that led to different training grounds.</p><p>The last time they entered this place, there were no void realm experts. This was the first time they had seen them.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into a cave at random. After pa.s.sing through the cave, a boundless plain appeared in front of him.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>On the plain, the roars were like thunder, and one could see many huge desolate beasts wandering around.</p><p>Some of the desolate beasts were already fighting with some young men.</p><p>“ROC wing technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He used his ruler’s power to activate the ROC wing technique. A pair of invisible wings seemed to have appeared on his back, causing his speed to increase explosively as he charged toward the plain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Not long after, a wild beast that looked like a lion and was ten meters tall pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not fight back. He cast the ROC wings technique and dodged the wild beast’s attack. He went around the wild beast and went deep into the plain.</p><p>Along the way, desolate beasts attacked Lu Ming continuously. He dodged them with the ROC wing technique. This way, he could also practice the ROC wing technique.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how deep he had gone. At this point, he could not see any other young talents.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally stopped.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a few dire beasts pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>These wild beasts weren’t very strong. Some of them were equivalent to 1st level void G.o.d Realm, some were 2nd level void G.o.d Realm, and there were only a few 3rd level void G.o.d Realm beasts.</p><p>Of course, there were also those at or above the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm. Of course, the number was even fewer.</p><p>A long spear formed in Lu Ming’s palm. At the same time, he cast the ROC wing technique and charged at the wild beasts.</p><p>The spear light swept across, and the roar was like thunder. The bitter cultivation had begun!</p><p>With desolate beasts as training, the speed of cultivation of incomplete divine skills would be much faster.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
