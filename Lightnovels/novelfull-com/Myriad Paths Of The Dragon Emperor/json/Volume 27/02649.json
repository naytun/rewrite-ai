His palm force whistled and swept across the entire fighting ring.</p><p>However, just as his palm was about to land, he lost track of Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye had been standing at the edge of the fighting ring, but he suddenly appeared behind yang Chong.</p><p>What an amazing speed!</p><p>Many people were shocked again!</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Linghu ye’s long sword whistled as it slashed toward yang Chong.</p><p>Yang Chong’s pupils rapidly contracted, and his divine power surged as he set up layers of defense around his body. At the same time, he suddenly turned around and waved his palm. The power of his palm collided with Linghu ye’s sword light, and then he took the opportunity to attack Linghu ye.</p><p>However, Linghu ye’s body moved again, moving away from yang Chong and appearing on his left.</p><p>so fast, so fast. This speed is too shocking!</p><p>the sixth level! The sixth level of a speed-type divine skill!</p><p>Someone exclaimed again.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Speed-type divine skill, level six!</p><p>How was it possible that Linghu ye had also cultivated his speed-type skill to the sixth level?</p><p>In just three years, he had cultivated two incomplete divine skills to the sixth level. This level of comprehension could no longer be described as abnormal, he’s managed to train two divine level experts to the sixth tier. Impressive!</p><p>Even Lu Ming could not help but sigh.</p><p>he had never imagined that there would be someone like him who had managed to cultivate two incomplete divine skills to the sixth level in just three years.</p><p>There were indeed countless prodigies in the primeval universe, and the heaven realm and the primordial realm couldn’t compare.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the primordial realm, he was definitely the first person in all of history. No one could compare to him.</p><p>Even the ancestor of technique, who had created the system of laws, was far from his level.</p><p>His talent was also unparalleled.</p><p>However, after coming to the desolate universe, he had met someone who could compare with him. At least, in terms of comprehension, Linghu ye was not weaker than him.</p><p>And this was only after the Qin heavenly thirteen clans recruited disciples once every 1000 years. How many abnormal geniuses had been bom in these countless years?</p><p>“Interesting, this is what makes it interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was looking forward to it.</p><p>This was the world he had been looking forward to.</p><p>In the heaven realm and the primordial realm, he had long been unrivaled among his peers. However, in the primal universe, he was still nothing.</p><p>However, it was only with an opponent that one would have passion and motivation.</p><p>“What a good fellow!”</p><p>The experts of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans also heaved a long sigh of relief. Their eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>With such perverted comprehension, if he cultivated the wondrous techniques of their sect, he would definitely be able to rise in time.</p><p>“What kind of freak is this?”</p><p>At this moment, yang Chong himself was also extremely shocked.</p><p>He tried his best, but he couldn’t hit Linghu ye.</p><p>Linghu ye’s speed was much faster than his, and with the addition of the sixth level of the offensive divine skill, the power was shocking.</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows continuously, but yang Chong was at a disadvantage.</p><p>The main thing was that he couldn’t hit Linghu ye, but Linghu ye could hit him.</p><p>Just like that, the two of them exchanged hundreds of moves. In the end, Linghu ye won and defeated yang Chong.</p><p>Linghu ye won. I didn’t expect this. I really didn’t expect this!</p><p>I was wrong. It seems that Linghu ye has a chance to win first place. However, Golden Sage is not like yang Chong. Golden Sage’s defense is amazing, and he can restrain Linghu ye!</p><p>that’s right. It seems like Lu Ming is the weakest among the five of them!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Linghu ye’s defeat of yang Chong was indeed beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Linghu ye’s face was calm as he retreated from the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Linghu ye left, a figure rushed down the fighting ring and stomped heavily on it, making the fighting ring roar.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get down here and die!”</p><p>Hu ya’s eyes were like lightning as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming, his voice reverberating throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring, facing Hu ya.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, if you touch me, I’ll make you die an ugly death!”</p><p>Hu ya’s voice was cold, and he revealed a sinister expression.</p><p>“Previously, the other members of your Tiger clan also said the same thing to me. In the end, when I made my move, I realized that they were all trash. In my opinion, you are no exception.”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“This kid… You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“He doesn’t know what’s good for him. If my cultivation wasn’t suppressed, I could’ve killed him with a flip of my hand!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, some of the young men from the Tiger clan were so angry that they almost vomited blood. They looked at Lu Ming with killing intent.</p><p>this Lu Ming is really arrogant. From what he’s saying, he’s implying that Hu ya is trash!</p><p>“Indeed, he’s crazy enough. However, if he talks too fast, I’m afraid he’ll have to face a storm of attacks from Hu ya.”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>As expected, a cold killing intent burst out from Hu ya’s eyes.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>He let out a long howl like a giant Tiger. The muscles on his body swelled up, and a terrifying divine grade power burst forth. He stomped his feet and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Hu ya’s fingers turned into claws and he struck out with both claws, trying to tear Lu Ming apart.</p><p>Lu Ming used his ruler’s divine power to form a long spear. He thrust it out several times and stabbed Hu ya’s claws.</p><p>The two of them collided more than a dozen times in a row, and their figures retreated at the same time.</p><p>Hu ya had cultivated two incomplete divine skills, one speed-type and one attack-type, both at the peak of the fourth stage.</p><p>Together with his Saint-grade divine power, his combat strength was not weaker than yang Chong’s.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Tiger’s teeth roared and it launched a storm of attacks at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>He wanted to suppress Lu Ming with his speed and then tear Lu Ming apart with his violent attacks.</p><p>Lu Ming kept waving his spear to block, but he was at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s current divine power was only displaying the power of a King-grade divine power.</p><p>“Lu Ming is indeed no match for Hu ya!”</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming’s divine power is King-grade divine power, and it’s an extremely powerful King-grade divine power. Moreover, his offensive divine skill has been cultivated to the peak of the fifth stage. In terms of offensive power, he’s not much weaker than Hu ya. However, his speed-type divine skill is the same as Hu ya, at the peak of the fourth stage. However, his divine power is not as strong as Hu ya’s, so he’s destined to be suppressed!</p><p>“Not bad. In terms of overall ability, Lu Ming is still weaker!”</p><p>Some people were watching while discussing.</p><p>competing in speed? then I’ll let you experience what speed is!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. In the next moment, Lu Ming’s figure burst into the sky like a Golden-winged ROC, soaring through the nine Heavens.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure and spear shadows filled the sky.</p><p>At this moment, countless spear shadows pierced towards Hu ya from all directions.</p><p>“This speed…”</p><p>Hu ya’s heart trembled as he tried his best to block it. However, he realized that there were too many spear shadows coming from all directions. It was impossible to block all of them.</p><p>“Blockit!”</p><p>die! Hu ya roared as he used his divine power to form a divine power barrier around his body.</p><p>BOOM! boom! boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Spear’s gleam continuously stabbed Hu ya’s divine power protective shield. The rain shield shook wildly. After a hundred consecutive strikes, the protective shield exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>Hu ya let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was pierced through by Lu Ming’s spear and he died on the spot..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
