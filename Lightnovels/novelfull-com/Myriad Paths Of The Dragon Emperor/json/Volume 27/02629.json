Little Qing, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, Tong Xi ‘er, and dandan, directly pa.s.sing by the Tigermen tribe and heading deep into the forest of stone steles.</p><p>The dozen or so Tiger Tribe youths nearly exploded in anger, and they gritted their teeth so hard that they made cracking sounds.</p><p>this brat is too impulsive. He actually dared to offend the heaven’s favorite of the Tigermen race!</p><p>“I reckon that in the chaotic astral River, he’s a peak grade heaven’s pride expert and is used to being arrogant. However, in a mere chaotic astral River, he’s a tyrant. In the entire Qin Tian star field, he’s nothing!”</p><p>that’s right. The Tigermen tribe is a large tribe in the Qin heaven Star Domain. There are hundreds of star rivers in the Qin heaven Star Domain, and the Tigermen tribe occupies one of them. They are extremely powerful. I heard that there are thousands of Tigermen tribe geniuses partic.i.p.ating in the thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment this time!</p><p>that’s right, there are indeed thousands of people. Even if they are divided into twenty regions, there will definitely be a large number of people from the Tiger Tribe in each region. I also heard that there is a peerless genius in the Tiger Tribe who can control sacred grade divine power. That kid will die a miserable death!</p><p>“It’s not wise to show off your power in front of a beauty!”</p><p>The surrounding people who had seen this scene were in a heated discussion.</p><p>These voices naturally reached Lu Ming’s ears. However, Lu Ming only smiled faintly and did not take it to heart.</p><p>At that time, when he was divided into 20 areas to fight, he would be more than happy if the Tigermen tribe came to find trouble with him.</p><p>Giving him points, what was there to be unhappy about?</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest wandered around the stone tablets, looking at each of them.</p><p>Not long after, Xie nianjun stopped in front of a stone tablet.</p><p>There was a sword technique carved on the stone tablet, and with just a glance, it seemed as if a holy sword light was bursting out.</p><p>“It’s a pretty good sword technique. I’ll choose this one!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said. Then, he stood under the stele and began to read it carefully.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest continued to search.</p><p>This forest of stone steles was extremely large and contained a vast number of incomplete divine skills.</p><p>An incomplete offensive divine skill, an incomplete defensive divine skill, an incomplete movement divine skill …</p><p>It had everything!</p><p>After more than a day, dandan and Tong Xi ‘er had found suitable incomplete divine skills and started to cultivate them.</p><p>“I’ll practice this sword technique!”</p><p>Xie nianqing walked to a stone tablet.</p><p>This stone tablet also recorded a sword technique. The sword technique was sharp and fierce, and demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Both Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were good at swordsmanship, so they each chose one.</p><p>Lu Ming was left alone. He continued to wander around.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that most of the people had chosen the incomplete attack-type divine skills.</p><p>That’s right, even if it was an incomplete divine skill, the difficulty of cultivating it would definitely be extremely shocking.</p><p>They only had one year, so they naturally had to choose to cultivate attack-type divine skills to increase their attack power so that they could kill their opponents as soon as possible in the a.s.sessment a year later and obtain points.</p><p>Lu Ming wandered around for a long time.</p><p>“This one!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a stone tablet. This stone tablet recorded an incomplete spear technique.</p><p>Moreover, there was no one under the stone tablet. Lu Ming simply chose this.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming began to read it carefully.</p><p>This spear technique didn’t have a name. In fact, all the incomplete divine skills here didn’t have names. They were all evolved from complete divine skills by some experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>To the experts at the peak of ethereal G.o.d Realm and above, it had no practical use. Those experts could already cultivate the complete divine technique.</p><p>However, it was still very useful for the cultivation of experts below the peak of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“What an exquisite divine skill …”</p><p>After studying it, Lu Ming felt emotional.</p><p>Shen skills were the exquisite use of Shen power. They were powerful and very exquisite. It was much more difficult to comprehend than the various techniques in the heaven realm.</p><p>The incomplete divine skill before him had a total of seven stages. However, it was extremely difficult to cultivate the first stage.</p><p>Lu Ming abandoned all distracting thoughts and focused on his comprehension.</p><p>This comprehension lasted for a month.</p><p>In a month’s time, Lu Ming had not even learned the basics.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming condensed a long spear with his Dominator’s power. The long spear vibrated at a strange frequency, sometimes whipping and sometimes stabbing forward. The Spear’s radiance flickered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stopped halfway through his cultivation.</p><p>“No, it’s still not right …”</p><p>once this spear technique is successfully cultivated, each spear strike can trigger layers of force. The force will be superimposed and the power will be infinite. There will also be many different changes, but I still can’t find that feeling!</p><p>the divine power is circulating incorrectly …</p><p>Many thoughts ran through Lu Ming’s mind as he summarized what he had learned from his previous cultivation.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming started to comprehend again.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating an incomplete divine skill was too high. Even with Lu Ming’s comprehension and talent, it was already so difficult to comprehend it. One could imagine the difficulty for the others.</p><p>Time flew by, and another month pa.s.sed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hand swept out and a terrifying roar burst out in the air. It rang three times and then disappeared.</p><p>“Success! I’ve finally stepped into the first stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>After more than two months of hard work, Lu Ming had finally cultivated the incomplete divine skill to the first level.</p><p>At the first level, a single strike of the spear would have three levels of power exploding out in an instant. The power was extremely shocking.</p><p>At the same time, there were three changes contained within, making it difficult to grasp and guard against.</p><p>If one cultivated it to the second level, one’s spear could have five levels of power and five changes.</p><p>The higher the level of cultivation, the stronger the power.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to study.</p><p>After cultivating to the first stage, the difficulty of cultivation became even greater.</p><p>For any divine skill, the later it was, the more difficult it would be.</p><p>If even the initial stage was so difficult, one could imagine how difficult it would be later on.</p><p>Lu Ming was focused on his cultivation and did not care about the outside world.</p><p>Half a year later, Lu Ming finally broke through to the second level of this spear technique.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming and the rest had been here for eight months. There were still four months to go before the a.s.sessment began.</p><p>Four months pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The one year period was up!</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming’s spear technique was still stuck at the second level and had not reached the third level.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a buzzing sound rang out in the sky. In the sky, a series of symbols appeared, and they were extremely colorful.</p><p>“It’s about to start!”</p><p>“It’s finally starting!”</p><p>Many people were whispering.</p><p>Some people were nervous, but some people revealed looks of antic.i.p.ation.</p><p>Suddenly, pillars of light appeared in the sky and enveloped everyone. Then, everyone flew into the sky along the pillars of light and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had appeared in a room.</p><p>“This place … Is this the area for the a.s.sessment?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>This a.s.sessment would be divided into twenty different areas. More than one million people would enter twenty different areas and fight.</p><p>As for which region they would enter, it was completely random.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
