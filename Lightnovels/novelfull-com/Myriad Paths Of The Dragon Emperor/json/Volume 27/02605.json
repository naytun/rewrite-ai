He called QiuQiu over and smashed it in his face.</p><p>“This old man will fight you to the death!”</p><p>The three eyed race’s old man bellowed in anger. The battle blade in his hand madly slashed towards QiuQiu.</p><p>On QiuQiu’s round body, a huge mouth full of fangs suddenly appeared and bit down on the three eyed race’s old man’s saber.</p><p>Ka-bang!</p><p>The battle blade of the three eyed race’s old man was directly bitten off.</p><p>The three eyed race old man was dumbfounded, stunned, completely stunned. He felt that he was in a complete mess.</p><p>This battle saber of his was a level five low grade G.o.d artifact. It was incomparably tough, so how could it be broken so easily?</p><p>But now, it was broken by QiuQiu in one bite. He was really dumbfounded!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and thrust his spear forward, piercing through the glabella of the three-eyed race’s old man and killing him.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he collected the storage ring of the three-eyed G.o.d race elder.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu opened its mouth wide and swallowed the other party’s battle saber in two or three bites. It chewed with a satisfied expression, making crunching sounds as it ate.</p><p>Even the few experts of the righteous Army were stunned. The other two experts of the yuanluo Palace seized the opportunity and broke out of their encirclement.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice reverberated throughout the entire area from the sky.</p><p>He was a terrifying existence from the yuanluo Palace. The aura he exuded was shocking and unfathomable. Lu Ming estimated that he was a ninth-tier void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>However, there were also people of this level in the righteous Army.</p><p>The two of them had been fighting for a long time. Now that they had separated, the people from the yuanluo Palace had given the order to retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The experts from the yuanluo Palace retreated and turned into streaks of light, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The righteous Army did not pursue. They understood that they should not pursue a cornered enemy. Furthermore, their mission was to guard King Chen Island.</p><p>The people of the yuanluo Palace retreated, and the righteous Army checked the casualties and cleaned up the battlefield before returning to their cave abodes.</p><p>After a great battle, some people were injured, some were heavily damaged, and they all needed to recover.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his cave abode and took out some divine crystals to start recovering.</p><p>Triggering the double battle power of the battle character formula would consume a lot of world power and ruler power.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming had fully recovered.</p><p>Then, a black iron token appeared in his hand. It was the mission token.</p><p>At this moment, the black metal token was emitting a faint light.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this token came from killing the yuanluo Palace’s experts. However, if he brought it back, the hall of missions would be able to find out about Lu Ming’s battle results through some method and reward him accordingly.</p><p>After keeping the token, Lu Ming took out a few storage rings.</p><p>These few storage rings were obtained by Lu Ming when he killed his enemies.</p><p>There were two items left behind by fifth-level void G.o.d Realm powerhouses. Lu Ming was looking forward to it and began to count them.</p><p>After counting, Lu Ming could not stop smiling.</p><p>There were a total of 60000 divine crystals.</p><p>In addition to the divine crystals from before, Lu Ming had nearly one hundred thousand divine crystals.</p><p>In addition, there were more than a dozen divine weapons of various levels.</p><p>&Nbsp; the highest G.o.d artifact was a level five low quality G.o.d artifact, while the others were level three and level four. Added together, they were also worth a lot.</p><p>Lu Ming casually threw two handfuls of level three low-grade divine artifacts to QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu grabbed it and ate it quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and closed his eyes to cultivate.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, Jing Yu’s painting unfurled, and a powerful sovereign’s will emanated from it.</p><p>Lu Ming calmed his heart and started to comprehend.</p><p>This cultivation lasted for ten days. These ten days were peaceful and the yuanluo Palace did not attack.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up after he ended his cultivation.</p><p>“Eh? Where’s that fellow QiuQiu?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around but did not find any traces of QiuQiu.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the cave abode and soon, he made a discovery.</p><p>Other than the holes, the cave was sealed on all four sides. It was made of the special rock of the mine vein here, which was extremely hard.</p><p>But now, a cave had appeared in the depths of the cave.</p><p>Looking at the marks, it was clearly gnawed out. On both sides of the cave, there were teeth marks.</p><p>“This can’t be gnawed out by QiuQiu, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Then, his muscles and bones began to wriggle. Finally, his entire body shrank and he rushed into the cave.</p><p>The cave was very long. Lu Ming walked for a few thousand meters before he saw QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu was currently gnawing at the surrounding rocks with its mouth wide open.</p><p>The rocks here were actually the old gold mine.</p><p>Chen jinkuang had mixed with the rock, becoming extremely hard.</p><p>Normally, to extract Chen Jin, one had to extract it from the rock mine, which was a complicated process.</p><p>However, QiuQiu directly swallowed the mineral vein in big mouthfuls. After a while, it spat out some powder and impurities.</p><p>this guy can’t be absorbing the Chen Jin inside, right? how can he do that? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was somewhat shocked.</p><p>QiuQiu noticed Lu Ming and swept a glance at him before continuing to gobble up the food. It ate very quickly and soon, a huge cave was formed in the area.</p><p>Lu Ming looked on with interest.</p><p>After eating for half a day, QiuQiu’s body had expanded by a full size before it stopped. It rolled to the side like a ball and even burped before it stopped moving.</p><p>It was obvious that he had eaten too much and was beginning to digest.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not bother about it.</p><p>In any case, this mine vein was incomparably huge. QiuQiu shouldn’t be discovered if it ate some.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the cave abode and continued cultivating. Occasionally, he would walk out of the cave abode to inquire about the situation outside.</p><p>During this time, no one from the yuanluo Palace had come to attack Chen jindao.</p><p>A few days later, a piece of news came.</p><p>The yuanluo Palace had sent out a large number of experts to attack the seven Star Island.</p><p>“Could the origin Luo Palace’s true goal be the seven Star Island? Did you attack Chen jindao just to cover it up?”</p><p>perhaps they want to take over Seven Star Island and drive our Righteous Army out of the northern Shang planet. They want to take over the planet for themselves!</p><p>“It’s very possible!”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, the attacks on Seven Star Island became more and more frequent. The pressure on Seven Star Island increased, and they began to transfer experts from the surrounding islands to reinforce them.</p><p>Chen jindao originally had around eight hundred people guarding it, but four hundred were transferred, leaving four hundred people.</p><p>Lu Ming was not transferred away. He was still in charge of chenjing Island.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming had been on chenjin Island for a month.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming felt a wave of fluctuations coming from the channel that QiuQiu had created.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he rushed into the pa.s.sage.</p><p>In the depths of the pa.s.sage, QiuQiu had already gnawed out a huge underground s.p.a.ce, and a large number of mineral veins had been swallowed by QiuQiu.</p><p>At this moment, QiuQiu’s body was emitting waves of radiance.</p><p>It was about to advance again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
