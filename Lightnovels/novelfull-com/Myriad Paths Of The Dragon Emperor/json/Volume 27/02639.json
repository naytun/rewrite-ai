It could not disguise low-level divine power as high-level divine power.</p><p>Why would a normal person who controlled King grade Shen power disguise their Shen power as normal Shen power?</p><p>Normal people would wish that their Shen power level was higher.</p><p>Only a small number of people who controlled sacred grade divine power or divine grade divine power would disguise their divine power as low-level divine power in order to not attract attention.</p><p>However, such people were too rare!</p><p>Therefore, as Lu Ming had said, a secret skill like the soul transformation technique was of little value. No one would buy it.</p><p>The shopkeeper’s expression changed. He knew that Lu Ming had a point.</p><p>“50000 divine crystals. Any more and I won’t take it. I’m just curious!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and was about to turn around and leave.</p><p>wait a minute, customer. 50000 it is. I’ll sell it to you!</p><p>The shopkeeper quickly called out to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took out 50000 divine crystals and handed it to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper then went into the depths of the shop and returned with a Jade card for Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. It was the secret skill of the ‘divine transformation technique’.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After putting them away, they walked out of the shop and walked around for a while. Xie nianqing, Tong Xi ‘er, dandan, and the others each bought some things they needed.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he bought a few books that introduced some divine pills and returned to the inn.</p><p>After returning to the inn, Lu Ming took out a book that introduced divine pills and read it carefully.</p><p>……</p><p>Xie nianjun walked around alone. Soon, she came to a tall building.</p><p>The experienced ones could tell that this was a famous place on planet thousand spirits for gathering information.</p><p>It was opened by a terrifying force that had power spread across more than half of the primal universe. One could buy a lot of information here.</p><p>Xie nianjun walked in and was immediately welcomed.</p><p>“Miss, how may I help you?”</p><p>A young woman asked.</p><p>“I want to get some information!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“Excuse me, is it news from the Qin heaven Starfield or from other starfields?”</p><p>The young woman asked.</p><p>“Other star fields!”</p><p>Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Those from the other star fields, please follow me!”</p><p>The young lady led Xie nianjun into a room. Half an hour later, Xie nianqing frowned and left the building.</p><p>……</p><p>A storm was brewing on planet myriad spirit.</p><p>Some of the smaller forces had already started to meet up with some of the heaven’s favorites who were not at the top of the rankings, hoping to win them over.</p><p>In an Inn!</p><p>d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it! Those b.a.s.t.a.r.ds from the righteous heaven Army actually managed to get into the top 100! d.a.m.n it!</p><p>Kang long roared, his eyes filled with jealousy.</p><p>Beside him, situ Xiao was in a similar state.</p><p>This time, there were actually five people from the righteous heaven Army who had entered the top 100 of their respective regions, which was far beyond their expectations.</p><p>As for Kang long and situ Xiao, they didn’t make it into the top 100 of their respective regions. Now, if they wanted to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans, it would be a mystery and would depend on luck.</p><p>“Don’t worry. As long as I join a sect, I’ll definitely recommend you to join together!”</p><p>Situ Feng said indifferently.</p><p>“Many thanks, big brother!”</p><p>Situ Xiao was all smiles.</p><p>“Many thanks, brother situ!”</p><p>Kang long thanked him profusely.</p><p>This time, it was fortunate that he had situ Feng. Not only had situ Feng entered the top 100 in his region, but his ranking wasn’t low either. Entering the Qin heaven thirteen clans was a matter of course.</p><p>Feng ‘er, you have to perform well in the second round. The better you perform, the more you will be valued by the Qin heaven thirteen clans. After you join, the treatment you will receive will also be better!</p><p>Situ haonan warned.</p><p>“I know!”</p><p>Situ Feng nodded, and his eyes were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>This time, he wants to amaze the world with a single brilliant feat and leave the chaotic astral River.</p><p>The qintian Galaxy and even the desolate universe were his stage.</p><p>On a mountain to the North of Wanling city.</p><p>This was the gathering place of the Tigermen.</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the mountain.</p><p>Hu Mao, and you, Hu Gu, with your talent, you actually didn’t enter the top hundred of the twentieth region. What’s going on? ”</p><p>Hu ya’s gaze was like lightning as he swept towards Hu Mao, Hu Gu, and the others.</p><p>Tiger fur, tiger bones, usually very impressive, but in front of Hu ya, it was like a mouse seeing a cat. Being swept by Hu ya’s gaze, he shivered.</p><p>“It’s all that brat’s fault. that b.a.s.t.a.r.d from the chaotic astral River …”</p><p>Hu Mao gritted his teeth and told him about Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaotic astral River? I didn’t expect that a mere chaotic astral River would have such a genius. However, no matter who it is, he must be punished for killing a member of my Tiger clan!”</p><p>don’t worry. Don’t let me meet him in the second round. Otherwise, I’ll make sure he dies a horrible death!</p><p>Hu ya said coldly.</p><p>If it were not for the rule that one was not allowed to lay a hand on other partic.i.p.ants during the a.s.sessment period, he would have mobilized his power to find Lu Ming and kill him.</p><p>……</p><p>Time flew by and three days pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming had already finished reading the few books that introduced divine pills. He had also roughly matched the divine pills he had obtained from the G.o.d’s cave abode.</p><p>The pills in the deity’s cave abode were not of a high grade. Otherwise, the deity would not have left them there.</p><p>There were healing medicinal pills, antidotes, and cultivation enhancing medicinal pills …</p><p>Among them, Lu Ming was most interested in two types of pills.</p><p>One was the congealing divine pill!</p><p>One was the spirit strengthening pill!</p><p>The congealing divine elixir could speed up the convergence of 10000 Yuan, allowing the transformation void martial stage to step into the demiG.o.d realm faster.</p><p>This was exactly what Lu Ming needed now.</p><p>There was also the spirit strengthening pill, which was extremely helpful to those in the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>After a virtual G.o.d consumed it, they could condense and increase their divine power, break through to a higher realm, and greatly speed up their cultivation.</p><p>Among them, there were two bottles of congealing divine elixir, with a total of 18 pills.</p><p>There were a total of six bottles of spirit strengthening pills, which contained 54 pills.</p><p>Lu Ming gave Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and Tong Xi ‘er a bottle of spirit strengthening pills each. This way, they could speed up their cultivation. He kept two bottles for himself.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>At the side, QiuQiu was hugging a piece of magical fragment and eating it with great joy.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took out a few more pieces of the divine artifact fragments and threw them to QiuQiu. He took out a congealing divine pill and swallowed it before he started cultivating.</p><p>The one-month period was up in the blink of an eye.</p><p>On this day, the Jade token shone again and brought them into the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>It was still the same stone stele Forest from last time. On it, there were all kinds of different incomplete divine skills.</p><p>This time, they had two years to comprehend it.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>On the other side of the Stele Forest, the roars of beasts could be heard.</p><p>This time, it was a little different from the last time.</p><p>&Nbsp; this time, the dream dimension had opened up a training ground filled with countless desolate beasts, allowing everyone to enter.</p><p>This way, it would be of great help in comprehending and cultivating incomplete divine skills.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
