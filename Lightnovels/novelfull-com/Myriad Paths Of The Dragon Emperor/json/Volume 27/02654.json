Even though they had been using the teleportation formation, it took them a month to reach one of the planets near planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>The teleportation formation couldn’t teleport directly to the Kong Xuan planet. It could only teleport to the planets around the Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>They stood on this planet and looked into the s.p.a.ce. They could see a huge star slowly rotating in the void. That was planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>On this planet, beams of light shot up into the sky and flew toward planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>A Starship!</p><p>All of them were starships. At first glance, most of the rainbow lights were starships, rushing into s.p.a.ce and flying toward planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>At a glance, there were at least a few thousand starships.</p><p>This scene was shocking.</p><p>“This … As expected of the Kong Xuan sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He could not calm down.</p><p>Chaotic astral river’s Righteous Army was indeed incomparable to the Kong Xuan sect. The difference was too great.</p><p>The righteous Army only had a dozen or so interplanetary warships, and they were all of the lowest grade.</p><p>But here, at a glance, there were thousands of them.</p><p>There was no comparison at all. The righteous heavenly Army was like a remote village, while planet kongxuan was like an international metropolis.</p><p>Huo Quan took out an interstellar battleship. The interstellar battleship expanded rapidly and floated in the air.</p><p>“Let’s get into the Starship!”</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>After everyone had entered, Huo Quan took control of the Starship and flew towards planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>This interplanetary warship was of a higher grade and much faster than the ones of the righteous Army.</p><p>From the inside, one could see that the Kong Xuan planet was slowly growing larger, until it finally covered the sky and blocked everyone’s vision.</p><p>After pa.s.sing through the atmosphere of Kong Xuan planet, everyone got out of the Starship. Under Huo Quan’s lead, they flew in one direction and soon came to a huge mountain.</p><p>This mountain range stretched on endlessly and was incomparably huge. One could see that there were all sorts of buildings built on it. From time to time, there would be people flying in the air.</p><p>this is the outer court District of the Kong Xuan sect. All the disciples who have just joined are considered outer court disciples of the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>only when you break through to the true G.o.d stage can you enter the inner sect area and become an inner sect disciple of the Kong Xuan sect. You’ll be able to enjoy all kinds of benefits!</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>Everyone nodded. In fact, most of the sects had similar rules. The hierarchy was strict, and it was also to stimulate the disciples to cultivate hard.</p><p>of course, if you want to become an inner sect disciple, there are also restrictions. Within a million years, if you can’t break through to the true G.o.d Realm, you’ll lose the qualification to become an inner sect disciple forever. You can only go to other planets and help the sect manage some businesses!</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>“A million years!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled, and then they revealed determined expressions.</p><p>In a million years, they had to break through to the true G.o.d Realm.</p><p>A million years might seem long, but it was nothing to a martial G.o.d.</p><p>In the martial G.o.d Realm, if one did not have some natural treasures or Supreme-grade divine pills, it would be extremely difficult to break through each level. It would take a lot of time.</p><p>Especially the bottleneck from virtual G.o.d-level to true G.o.d-level, many people would be stuck for hundreds of thousands of years, millions of years, or even tens of millions or hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>They were all very young, all under ten thousand years old. Although they were all talented, they couldn’t guarantee that they could all break through to the true G.o.d Realm within one million years.</p><p>If he couldn’t break through to true G.o.d, he would have to be a.s.signed to other planets to help Kong Xuan sect manage their businesses. In that case, his achievements in the future would be limited if he was distracted.</p><p>within a million years, I will definitely become a true G.o.d and an inner sect disciple!</p><p>I’m already at the third level of the void G.o.d Realm. I’ll definitely break through within one million years!</p><p>……</p><p>The 150 youths all had determined gazes and were extremely confident in themselves.</p><p>Huo Quan saw this and smiled casually.</p><p>He had lived for a long time and had seen too many geniuses that appeared once every thousand years. Every one of them had great confidence at the beginning.</p><p>However, every year, many people couldn’t break through within a million years. Most of them were stuck at the peak of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t say it out loud to hurt everyone’s confidence.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>let’s go! Huo Quan said as he flew toward the mountain range ahead. The group followed him, and soon, they arrived at the mountain range’s exit. Two young men, a man and a woman, came over to welcome them.</p><p>“Greetings, elder Huo!”</p><p>The two young men bowed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Huo Quan nodded and said to Lu Ming and the rest, ” follow these two senior brothers and sisters to find a place to stay. After you’ve settled down, you’ll have to register your information at the human affairs Hall in three days and receive your ident.i.ty tokens. I’m going to report your matter now!</p><p>With that, Huo Quan turned into a rainbow and left.</p><p>junior brothers and sisters, we outer sect disciples live separately for men and women. Men live in one area, and women live in another area. Junior sisters, follow me!</p><p>The woman said, then turned around and flew into the mountain range.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll be leaving first!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and nodded. Then, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and the other female disciples left with the woman.</p><p>There were more than 150 of them. There were fewer women, about 50 of them, and the remaining 100 were all male disciples.</p><p>“My fellow junior brothers, follow me!”</p><p>The man said. He turned around and left, and everyone followed.</p><p>Soon, they came to a building.</p><p>There were courtyards here, and each one was extremely s.p.a.cious.</p><p>“This is where the outer sect disciples will live. You can choose for yourself. There is a sign on the door of each courtyard. However, if there is someone living here, the sign will be taken off. You can choose those with the sign. You can choose at will!”</p><p>“After you’ve made your choice, report to the Human Resources Hall within three days!”</p><p>After saying that, the young man turned around and left, as if he had some concerns.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group were puzzled but they did not care. They walked toward the courtyards.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>At this moment, the door of a courtyard opened and a few young men walked out. They looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a mocking expression.</p><p>“The once-in-a-Millennium newcomer is here again!”</p><p>One of the young men chuckled and walked toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Greetings, senior brothers!”</p><p>Some people greeted the young men. After all, they were new here, and some people didn’t dare to act rashly.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>It was obvious that one of the young men was the leader. It was a young man in a yellow robe. He had an aquiline nose and a sharp face. He nodded and glanced at Lu Ming and the others.”Right now, you still don’t have the right to choose a courtyard!”</p><p>“I’m not qualified to choose a courtyard yet. However, that senior brother just now …”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Nonsense, I have the final say here!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s eyes turned cold as he rebuked, ” “If you want to choose a courtyard, you can. But you have to pay ten thousand divine crystals each!”</p><p>“What? Ten thousand divine crystals!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Ten thousand divine crystals wasn’t a small amount.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
