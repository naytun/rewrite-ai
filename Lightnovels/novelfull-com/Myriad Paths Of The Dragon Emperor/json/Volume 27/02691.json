He had never expected that the Yuexin that the ancestor of technique was looking for was actually Yue Linglong’s aunt.</p><p>This was too much of a coincidence!</p><p>“Is she really your aunt?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. He felt that this ‘problem lady’ was not very reliable.</p><p>of course it’s my aunt. If you don’t believe me, I’ll take you to her now!</p><p>Yue Linglong pouted, her face full of pride. She turned around and flew off in a certain direction.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly followed.</p><p>In the inner court of Kong Xuan sect, there were a few huge mountain ranges that were intertwined with each other. There were countless strange peaks and it was vast and boundless.</p><p>They flew for a while, and Yue Linglong flew towards a mountain peak.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, clouds and mist lingered, and flowers bloomed. It was a beautiful sight.</p><p>In the distance, a bamboo forest could be seen. In front of the bamboo forest was a Lake, and in the middle of the bamboo forest and the lake was a building.</p><p>At this moment, in a Pavilion by the lake, a woman was sprinkling some golden grains into the lake. Immediately, golden carps jumped out of the lake and fought for the grains.</p><p>“Aunt …”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted from afar.</p><p>The woman turned around and revealed her face.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The woman looked to be in her thirties, but she was still as beautiful as ever. She was a rare beauty.</p><p>“This is Yuexin?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>“It’s you, girl. Why did you think of coming here today?”</p><p>The woman said with a smile.</p><p>“Aunt, I miss you. I’m here to see you!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said with a smile.</p><p>“I still don’t know you well, girl. Tell me, why have you come to find me?”</p><p>The woman said. It was obvious that this woman was Yuexin.</p><p>“Aunt, I’m really here to see you. I’m here to do a small thing!”</p><p>Yue Linglong stuck out her tongue guiltily. She then looked at Lu Ming and said,”It’s him, he said he has something to tell you!”</p><p>“Is there something you need me for?”</p><p>Yuexin looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“May I ask if you are Yuexin, senior?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>that’s right. I’m Yuexin. Why are you looking for me? ”</p><p>Yuexin said.</p><p>“Senior, it’s like this. I was entrusted with a task to bring you something!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the dagger that the ancestor of technique had given him.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>At the sight of the dagger Lu Ming took out, Yuexin’s delicate body trembled. Her eyes were filled with complicated emotions as she reminisced about the past.</p><p>After a long time, Yuexin let out a long sigh and said, ” “Is the person who gave you the dagger called fa Ming?”</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“He … What else did he say?”</p><p>Yuexin asked again.</p><p>“He said that he was the one who let you down!”</p><p>Lu Ming repeated the ancestor of technique’s words.</p><p>Yuexin’s body trembled even more, and her eyes became misty. After a long time, she sighed again and said, ” he didn’t do anything wrong. I did him wrong. The next time you see him, tell him this. I’ll keep this dagger. Go!</p><p>In the end, Yuexin took the dagger, waved her hand, and walked toward a house. Her figure was a little lonely.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt that things were a little complicated.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what happened? What’s going on? It seems that my guess was right, it was indeed aunt’s old lover who came to find you.”</p><p>After Yuexin left, the fire of gossip burned in Yue Linglong’s eyes. She stared at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll talk after we leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and walked outside. Yue Linglong followed closely behind and asked a bunch of questions.</p><p>I finally know. Back then. grandfather wanted aunt to get married, but aunt seemed to be unwilling. In the end. she even caused quite a big storm …</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Your aunt is married?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>yeah, it caused quite a stir back then, but my grandfather managed to suppress it in the end. However, I only heard about it because I wasn’t even born at that time.</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“No wonder!”</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood why Yuexin said that she was the one who had let the ancestor of technique down.</p><p>The ancestor of technique had always missed Yuexin, but Yuexin was already married.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lu Ming also sighed. He did not know how to tell the ancestor of technique about this the next time he saw him.</p><p>This was the reality, and reality was so helpless.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and put this matter aside. He had already fulfilled his promise to the ancestor of technique. As for other things, he could not do anything about it.</p><p>by the way, I have something to ask you. Do you know how to cultivate the Saint-grade divine technique of the Kong Xuan sect? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You want to cultivate a Saint-grade Divine Art? “This will be a little difficult. First, you’ll have to enter the true G.o.d stage and become an inner sect disciple. Then, you’ll have to display your top talent and pa.s.s a series of tests to prove that you’re loyal to the Kong Xuan sect and not a spy sent by other sects. Only then will you be taught.”</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“It’s so difficult …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>it’s just that difficult. You should know that there are only two divine grade techniques in the entire Kong Xuan sect. As the sect’s treasure, the conditions for learning the complete divine grade technique are too harsh. At most. you can only learn the incomplete one …</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Incomplete? Where can i learn something incomplete?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>When he cultivated other divine techniques, he did not need a complete one. Even an incomplete one would do. He only needed to cultivate a wisp of Shen power.</p><p>you can exchange for it in the Sutra library. You just have to ask the elders who guard the Sutra library. However, the price is shockingly high. There are 12 levels to the Saint-grade divine skill. The first level costs 50000 points, and the second level costs 100000 points. The price keeps on doubling. The point is that it’s not very useful without a complete one!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“I can exchange for it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He did not need the complete one at all. He only needed the first level. After cultivating the first level, he would be able to cultivate a wisp of divine Power and Light the divine fire. This was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>But then, he sighed.</p><p>The first level already required 50000 points. This price was simply outrageously high.</p><p>Even if he exchanged all his remaining G.o.d crystals for points, he would only get a little more than 10000 points. He was still far from enough.</p><p>“Kong Xuan sect, where can i earn points?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>the place to earn points is, of course, the mission Hall. The sect will issue a series of missions. As long as you complete the missions inside, you can get points. However, I suggest that you don’t take any missions. It’s not worth it!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s because there’s a level limit to the missions you can take on. You’re an outer Disciple Now, so you can only take on the lowest level of missions. Those missions are usually time-consuming and laborious, and the rewards are very low. Many of them only reward one point, two points, and no more than ten points …</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He only got one or two points for a mission. How long would it take him to get 50000 points?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
