Then, he leaped and flew onto the stone platform.</p><p>“I wish I could meet you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and replied, causing situ Feng’s eyes to emit a cold light.</p><p>The compet.i.tion continued!</p><p>One by one.</p><p>Not long after, it was Xie nianjun’s turn.</p><p>beauty, you’re so beautiful. I can’t bear to hurt you. You should just admit defeat!</p><p>Xie nianjun’s opponent was a rather handsome young man. He looked at Xie nianjun teasingly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie nianjun immediately attacked. His sword light burst forth and enveloped his opponent.</p><p>His opponent’s incomplete divine skill had only been cultivated to the third level. He was no match for Xie nianjun and was killed after a few moves.</p><p>“What a powerful woman!”</p><p>Many people were secretly shocked.</p><p>“She’s holding back!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The others were shocked by Xie nianjun’s power, but Lu Ming knew that Xie nianjun had held back. He did not use his full strength. Otherwise, he could have killed the other party in one move.</p><p>Lu Ming was curious as to why Xie nianjun had held back. Given her character, she would have killed him with one strike if he had provoked her like that.</p><p>The compet.i.tion continued, and soon it was Xie nianqing’s turn.</p><p>Xie nianqing seemed to have held back as well. He did not use his full strength, especially when it came to the use of divine power. This made others think that she only controlled King-grade divine power.</p><p>Then, it was Tong Xi ‘er’s turn!</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er’s talent was very high, and the king grade divine power she controlled was also a very terrifying King grade divine power. Her comprehension was also extremely high, and she easily defeated her opponent.</p><p>Three people from the righteous Army advanced in a row, causing the smiles on Kang Ji and situ haonan’s faces to slowly disappear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a beam of light suddenly rose from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>It was his turn!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on the field.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. His opponent was actually a three-eyed race member.</p><p>It looked almost the same as the evil G.o.d tribe of the evil G.o.d World.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had also read some ancient books and had a better understanding of the three-eyed race.</p><p>The three eye race was considered a large race in the Qin heaven star region. They were very strong.</p><p>Furthermore, the three eyed race was under the multi-eyed race.</p><p>The multi-eyed race was an extremely terrifying race. Even in the primeval universe, its reputation was well-known. It was ranked near the top of the list of 10000 races in the primeval universe.</p><p>The three-eyed race was only a branch of the multi-eyed race.</p><p>Of course, the three-eyed race in front of him had nothing to do with the yuanluo Palace. However, due to the evil G.o.d World, Lu Ming naturally did not have a good impression of the three-eyed race.</p><p>“Brat, I advise you …”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the three eyed race was ready to show off.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. He rushed over and swept his long spear across.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the three-eyed race roared in anger. His divine power condensed into a battle axe and he swung it at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The battle-ax and the spear collided. A total of nine layers of power burst out from the spear.</p><p>The nine-layered strength was the manifestation of the fourth-layered incomplete divine skill of the spear technique.</p><p>The terrifying power directly destroyed the battle-ax condensed by the three eyed race’s Prodigy’s divine power. Then, the long spear struck the three eyed race’s Prodigy’s body. He screamed in pain and his body exploded, turning into energy and dissipating. In the next moment, he condensed on the stone platform and looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>He could not even withstand one move from Lu Ming and was killed in seconds.</p><p>the fourth level! His incomplete divine skill has also reached the fourth level!</p><p>“Terrifying. Look at his badge. This person also comes from the chaotic astral River. In the chaotic astral River, there are actually two existences who have cultivated their incomplete divine skills to the fourth level!”</p><p>“It seems that we’ve all underestimated the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities shocked many people.</p><p>Even the important figures of the Qin heaven thirteen clans were a little shocked.</p><p>Obviously, they had not expected that several good people would appear in succession in the chaotic astral River, which was beyond their expectations.</p><p>Originally, they did not put the chaotic astral River in their eyes at all. They thought that there would not be any heaven’s pride experts in the chaotic astral River. Therefore, in the past, when the thirteen clans recruited disciples, they did not open up the chaotic astral River to them.</p><p>This time, it was only because a certain important figure of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans had a sudden impulse and said that they would also open up the chaotic astral River. That’s why they are recruiting disciples this time and also opening it up to the chaotic astral River.</p><p>“It seems that I’ll have to go to the chaotic astral river more often in the future. Maybe I’ll find some good seedlings!”</p><p>The experts of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans had different thoughts in their minds.</p><p>the fourth level of an incomplete divine skill … It seems like it’s not that difficult to successfully cultivate it? ”</p><p>Outside, the ancestor of technique laughed. He deliberately raised his voice and transmitted it to Kang Ji and situ haonan’s ears.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan coldly snorted, their faces were gloomy.</p><p>“If I had known that this brat’s talent was so high, I would have killed him long ago!”</p><p>Situ haonan gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>Back then, when they were besieging the ancestor of technique on Chen Jin Island on the northern Shang planet, it was Lu Ming who had suddenly appeared and given the ancestor of technique a level Seven middle-grade divine artifact, allowing him to turn the tide of the battle.</p><p>If he had known that Lu Ming was so talented and had become situ Feng’s rival, he would have killed Lu Ming with all his might that day.</p><p>But now, it was too late. They were filled with regret.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Feng ‘er will definitely go further than him in the end!”</p><p>Situ haonan gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed his opponent, he returned to the fighting ring. When many people looked at him, they were on guard. They obviously saw him as a threatening opponent.</p><p>interesting! It’s only interesting to kill like this!</p><p>When the Tiger’s teeth looked at Lu Ming, they revealed a hint of ferocity.</p><p>The compet.i.tion continued!</p><p>Pairs of people entered the arena and continued to fight.</p><p>Most of them used their full strength as soon as they made their move, exploding with their peak combat strength.</p><p>They understood that the people of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans were watching. The better their performance was, the more they would be valued. Even if they were defeated by their opponents, as long as their performance was good enough, they would still be valued.</p><p>There were nearly 1000 matches in the first round of the compet.i.tion, and it took half a month before all of them ended.</p><p>Other than dandan, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine people had gone through nine hundred and ninety-nine rounds of compet.i.tion. One person had directly advanced without a fight.</p><p>In the second round, there were a total of 1000 people. They continued to fight in pairs like before.</p><p>After entering the second round, the compet.i.tion was undoubtedly more intense, because those who could enter the second round were all experts.</p><p>One battle after another continued.</p><p>Soon, it was situ Feng’s turn!</p><p>Situ Feng was indeed very strong. He had used an incomplete divine skill at the peak of the fourth stage and easily defeated his opponent.</p><p>Not long after, it was Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing’s turn. However, neither of them used their full strength. They pretended to fight with their opponent for dozens of moves before they defeated him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
