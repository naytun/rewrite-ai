His face was extremely gloomy as he stared at Lu Ming. His killing intent was even stronger than before.</p><p>1 said, you’re the same as the Tigermen from before. You’re all trash!</p><p>Lu Ming cast a disdainful look at Hu ya.</p><p>Creak…</p><p>He gritted his teeth and glared at Lu Ming, his killing intent growing stronger.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to kill you. My cultivation is suppressed here. Otherwise, 1 could kill you with one finger!”</p><p>Hu ya roared in his heart.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming only had a demigod cultivation base. In his eyes, Lu Ming was just an ant.</p><p>As a heaven’s favorite of the Tiger-Man Tribe that only appeared once every 100000 years, his actual cultivation had already reached the ninth level of the void God Realm and was not far from the true God Realm.</p><p>With such a cultivation level and his divine grade divine power, he would not be afraid even if he encountered a true God-level, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>It was just that he couldn’t display it here.</p><p>“Hu ya, he actually lost?”</p><p>“And he lost so easily?”</p><p>At this moment, everyone watching the battle was a little confused.</p><p>They only saw Lu Ming’s speed suddenly increase. In the blink of an eye, he had launched many attacks and defeated Hu ya in one fell swoop.</p><p>that speed is too shocking. Lu Ming was actually hiding his strength. What level is that incomplete speed-type divine skill?”</p><p>1 feel like I’ve grown a lot. Is the 5th level really that powerful? ”</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s the sixth level?”</p><p>Towards the end, many people felt that it was unbelievable.</p><p>an incomplete speed-type divine skill at the sixth level. Good!</p><p>At this moment, an expert from the unique devil Academy spoke, and his eyes revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>“Heavens, it really is the sixth level!”</p><p>Lu Ming actually has an incomplete divine skill and has comprehended it to the sixth level. His level of comprehension is not much worse than Linghu ye’s!</p><p>in that case, Lu Ming’s abilities are above Linghu ye’s. Doesn’t that mean that he’s aiming for the first place? ”</p><p>it’s hard to say. Although he’s fast, his attack power is similar to Hu ya’S. I’m afraid he can’t break through the defense of a Golden Saint!</p><p>“This is also shocking enough. There are too many heaven’s favorites with terrifying comprehension ability this time. Moreover, he’s from the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“This level of comprehension …”</p><p>The people of the chaotic astral River were all dumbfounded.</p><p>The pavilion master of Yunfeng Pavilion was ecstatic.</p><p>The stronger the genius of the chaotic astral River is, the more rewards he will receive.</p><p>Only Kang Ji and situ haonan’s faces were extremely ugly. There was killing intent in their eyes, but also fear.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique was naturally ecstatic.</p><p>On the stone platform, Linghu ye and the Golden Sage looked at Lu Ming with a serious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated to the fighting ring.</p><p>Now, only Lu Ming, Linghu ye and the Golden Sage were left.</p><p>“There’s only the three of you left. The thirteen clans have already seen your strength, so there’s no need for you to continue fighting!”</p><p>however, 1 believe many of you are curious about who is stronger. How about this? the three of you will take turns to fight and see who is stronger. Golden Sage, Linghu ye, you two will fight first!</p><p>The burly man in the air said.</p><p>The Golden Saint and Linghu ye nodded and appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Golden Sage’s eyes glowed with golden light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>His divine power was boiling. At the same time, his muscles bulged. His body changed color and had a metallic luster.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that a layer of armor appeared on the surface of his body.</p><p>This armor was formed by combining divine power with a defensive divine skill. It was like an armor made of diamond and gave off an indestructible feeling.</p><p>The Vajra race specialized in defense.</p><p>Their defensive power was even stronger than the turtle shell clan.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Golden Sage roared and rushed towards Linghu ye.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Linghu ye moved his body and easily dodged the attack of the Golden Sage.</p><p>Linghu ye’s incomplete speed-type divine skill had been cultivated to the sixth level, while the Golden Sage had not cultivated any speed-type divine skill at all. In terms of speed, he was much slower than Linghu ye and could not attack him at all.</p><p>The Golden Sage stopped his attack after his first attack failed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Golden Sage did not attack, but Linghu ye made his move. His body was like lightning as he charged towards the Golden Sage. In an instant, hundreds of sword lights stabbed towards the Golden Sage.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>The sound of collision was heard. In an instant, Linghu ye had sent hundreds of sword lights to stab the Golden Saint. However, they could not break through the Golden saint’s defense and were completely blocked.</p><p>Linghu ye, this is not enough! Not enough!</p><p>The Golden Sage grinned.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Linghu ye didn’t say a word and continued to attack. Dense sword light appeared in the sky and kept stabbing towards the Golden Saint.</p><p>However, it was still useless. The sword light stopped and the Golden Sage was unharmed.</p><p>hahaha, Linghu ye, you’re just scratching my itch …</p><p>The Golden Sage laughed.</p><p>Linghu ye retreated with a gloomy face and stopped attacking.</p><p>“It seems like this match will end in a draw!”</p><p>that’s right. Linghu ye’s comprehension is unparalleled. It’s a pity that his divine power is a little weak. If he had King-grade divine power, he might be able to break through the defense of a Golden Saint!</p><p>that’s right. Based on the current situation, the battle between Lu Ming and the Golden Sage should be a draw. It’s difficult to determine a winner between the three of them!</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Many people sighed. It wasn’t that Linghu ye wasn’t strong, but that the Golden saint’s defensive power was too abnormal. Moreover, what he cultivated was also an incomplete defensive divine skill.</p><p>However, speed was a Golden saint’s weakness. He could not catch up with Linghu ye, so this battle could only be considered a draw.</p><p>alright, this round is a draw. Take a break and move on to the next round, the Holy battle of the Golden Saints, Lu Ming!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>Linghu ye left, and the Golden Saint sat cross-legged on the battle platform, absorbing the energy of the divine crystals to recover his divine power.</p><p>Not long after, the Golden Sage stood up.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>The Golden Sage said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can go up!”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and stepped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t break through my defense. At most, this battle will be a draw!”</p><p>The Golden Sage said.</p><p>“How would you know if you didn’t fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“If you don’t want to give up, then let’s fight!”</p><p>” die! Golden Saint coldly shouted as he unleashed his divine power and used a defensive divine skill, creating a diamond-like armor that covered his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out and swept his spear across.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Golden Sage threw a punch at Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure moved and appeared behind the Golden Sage. He struck the Golden Sage’s body with his spear and eleven levels of power burst out in an instant.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Golden Sage’s body trembled a few times, but he managed to withstand it.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength changed and he continued to stab. The tip of the spear hit the Golden Sage’s body and made a tinkling sound. However, it was still blocked by the Golden Sage and it was difficult to break through..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
