However, Lu Ming and the rest did not notice him.</p><p>However, he did not stop her!</p><p>“This brat is so stubborn. My Tianhong faction invited him to join but he refused. Since he doesn’t want to join my Tianhong faction, he will be an enemy sooner or later. I can use the people from the floating light Faction to get rid of him!”</p><p>There was a flash of ruthlessness in Laozi’s eyes.</p><p>The elder was from the Tianhong Saint son’s faction.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, some outer deacons, inner deacons, outer elders, and even inner elders would join some factions to support a certain Holy Son or Holy Virgin to become the sect leader.</p><p>Since Lu Ming did not want to join the Tianhong sect, he would be the enemy of the Tianhong sect if he joined another sect in the future.</p><p>The old man chuckled, and in a flash, he left the place as if he had not seen anything.</p><p>“You two, surrender now. Otherwise, you’ll end up in a miserable state!”</p><p>The young man with the bow looked at Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun and spoke again.</p><p>that’s right. Hurry up. I’ll give you one last chance. Otherwise, you won’t have another chance!</p><p>The other seventh level void G.o.d Realm young man also said coldly.</p><p>“Wait, let’s charge together!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Xie nianjun and I will cast the dark holy light cage together later to trap a seventh-tier virtual G.o.d. Then, we’ll charge together!”</p><p>Xie nianqing replied.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded silently.</p><p>At this moment, the other party had already lost his patience.</p><p>if you’re so stubborn, then let’s just kill them both. Attack!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” fire! the bow-wielding youth shouted and pulled the bow. His G.o.d Power surged, and an arrow shot out.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and retreated frantically with Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>“You want to leave? die!”</p><p>The young man with the large bow shouted and shot an arrow. It was an Arrow of Light that was incomparably resplendent. Like a meteor, it shot toward Lu Ming, emitting a terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming had used the fallen star bow before. He knew that the single-target attack power of the bow and arrow as a weapon was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming did not dare to take it head-on.</p><p>“QiuQiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out. It turned into a shield and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The arrow was like a shooting star, hitting the shield that QiuQiu had transformed into. The shield trembled non-stop, but in the end, it was still blocked.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At the same time, the other four young men and women charged at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>In particular, the seventh-level void G.o.d-level powerhouse was the fastest and approached Lu Ming in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Downwind sword slash!”</p><p>die! the young man bellowed as he swung his saber. A crescent-shaped Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have the time to think. He waved his long spear to block the attack.</p><p>This long spear was a level nine low grade divine artifact.</p><p>The long spear vibrated and Lu Ming exerted the incomplete divine skill to its maximum.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the saber Light collided. Lu Ming felt an extremely terrifying force flowing along the long spear and surging toward him, wanting to tear his body apart.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood and his body was sent flying hundreds of meters.</p><p>Strong!</p><p>He was too strong!</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was no match for a sixth-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse, let alone a seventh-level virtual G.o.d-level powerhouse. The difference was too great.</p><p>One move and Lu Ming was injured!</p><p>However, with this delay, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun finally made their move.</p><p>“Dark holy light technique!”</p><p>With two shouts, it was as if two suns had suddenly appeared in the sky, one pitch-black and the other pure white.</p><p>The black and white light intertwined and turned into a dark holy light cage, enveloping the 7th tier void G.o.d Realm expert.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The opponent’s attack did not break the dark holy light cage.</p><p>However, the other three sixth-level void G.o.d Realm powerhouses had also arrived.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three of them attacked at the same time, launching a terrifying attack.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun struck out with their swords, and their sword lights collided with their enemies.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun used the force of the explosion to retreat.</p><p>“A level nine low grade G.o.d artifact!”</p><p>The other party looked at the swords in Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s hands with greed.</p><p>The swords in Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s hands were naturally given to them by Lu Ming. They were both level nine low-grade divine artifacts.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun retreated to Lu Ming’s side and the three of them continued to retreat.</p><p>QiuQiu also flew back quickly and met up with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving, chase!”</p><p>The young man with the bow shouted and chased after them.</p><p>The other three young men and women at the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm also gave chase.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The young man with the large bow shot out another terrifying arrow, but it was blocked by QiuQiu.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the young man who was trapped in the dark holy light cage had also blasted open the dark holy light cage and was chasing after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The two sides, one chasing and the other fleeing, quickly went far away.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, we must kill them!”</p><p>At this moment, the five young men and women with bows in their hands were all shocked.</p><p>After a short fight, they realized that the combat strength of Lu Ming and the rest was shockingly high.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a demiG.o.d while Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were only at third-level void G.o.d Realm. How could they block their attacks with such cultivation bases?</p><p>Sacred grade divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest must have mastered the divine grade divine power. Otherwise, they would not be so powerful.</p><p>Such a person must be killed. Leaving him alive would only bring disaster.</p><p>Soon, both parties had covered a hundred miles.</p><p>“Holy light escape technique!”</p><p>At that moment, holy light emanated from Xie nianjun’s body, making him look like a Holy maiden. Then, a pure white halo spread out and enveloped Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and the other two.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Immediately, their speed skyrocketed and became several times faster than before. They turned into a rainbow light and flew away, disappearing from the sight of the bow-wielding young man and the others.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>The few young men roared.</p><p>“That must be some kind of secret technique to escape. There must be some residual effects from such a fast speed. Chase after them. This time, we must kill them!”</p><p>The young man with the large bow said coldly. The five young men continued to chase in the direction where Lu Ming and the rest had disappeared.</p><p>Xie nianjun carried Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and flew for hundreds of thousands of miles before stopping. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>she’s injured from using the Holy Light escape technique. Let’s find a safe place first!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left the place with Xie nianjun.</p><p>Very quickly, they had run another few hundred thousand miles.</p><p>The others couldn’t run as fast in the forest, because they didn’t know when they would be attacked by the plant life forms.</p><p>However, they had QiuQiu with them. It could sense the presence of plant life forms and avoid them in advance.</p><p>Then, they found a Hidden Valley and rushed in.</p><p>As soon as they entered the valley, Lu Ming immediately took out a healing pill and fed it to Xie nianjun so that she could channel her energy to heal her injuries.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
