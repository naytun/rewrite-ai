He was the outer sect elder who had brought them to Kong Xuan sect during the a.s.sessment for the recruitment of disciples, Huo Quan.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The door of the secret room opened, and an old man with white hair and a white beard walked out. The old man’s eyes seemed to be filled with wisdom.</p><p>“Huo Quan pays his respects to the sect master!”</p><p>Huo Quan immediately saluted respectfully.</p><p>This old man was the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect, Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“Huo Quan, why are you looking for this Lord?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“Because of the new disciples, sect master was in closed door cultivation before, so I didn’t come to disturb you. I heard that sect master is about to come out of closed door cultivation, so I came to report!”</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>“A new disciple? You can just arrange this matter, why do you need to report to me?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said indifferently, a hint of displeasure on his face.</p><p>sect leader, it’s different this time. There’s a little guy inside. I suspect that the divine power he controls is divine-grade divine power!</p><p>Huo Quan immediately bowed and said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes widened as a terrifying aura burst out from his body. This aura was as vast as the universe. Even with Huo Quan’s heavenly G.o.d Realm cultivation base, he was still suppressed by this aura. His body trembled violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, the aura of the Dragon Boat Mountain was immediately retracted. However, his eyes still revealed deep shock.</p><p>“Divine-grade divine power. Is what you said true?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain asked as he stared at Huo Quan.</p><p>“This … This subordinate is not very sure. During the disciple recruitment test, I observed his moves many times, but that little fellow cultivates a special secret technique that can conceal his divine power aura very well. I am only suspicious, but I am not one hundred percent sure!”</p><p>Huo Quan said.</p><p>“Bring him here, I want to examine him personally!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Huo Quan bowed and took his leave.</p><p>“Divine-grade divine power, divine-grade divine power!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain muttered. His eyes flickered with a fiery light that was mixed with a hint of ferocity.</p><p>……</p><p>“Someone’s coming again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating. Sensing that there were people outside, he ended his cultivation and walked out.</p><p>“Elder Huo Quan!”</p><p>At the sight of Huo Quan, Lu Ming was slightly stunned and somewhat surprised.</p><p>Ever since he came to the outer sect of Kong Xuan sect, Lu Ming had not seen Huo Quan. Now, Huo Quan suddenly came to look for him. What was the matter?</p><p>Could it be about the battle with Dongfang Hao?</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets elder Huo!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me. The sect master wants to see you!”</p><p>Huo Quan smiled and sized Lu Ming up. There was a hint of shock in his eyes.</p><p>He remembered very clearly that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the demiG.o.d realm during the thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment. Now, he had actually reached the third level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>It had only been a few years, and such a cultivation speed was simply too shocking.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Lu Ming himself was stunned.</p><p>The sect master wanted to see him?</p><p>He was only an outer sect disciple who had just entered the sect. Why would the sect master of Kong Xuan sect want to see him all of a sudden?</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Huo Quan suppressed the shock in his heart, turned around, and flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming could only suppress the doubts in his heart and follow Huo Quan.</p><p>The outer sect of the Kong Xuan sect was located on a huge mountain range. One would reach the inner sect area if they went deep into the mountain range.</p><p>This was not a single mountain range, but rather, several. They were like enormous Dragons that were intertwining with each other.</p><p>The divine Qi here was extremely dense, and the cultivation conditions here were even better than the outer sect.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Huo Quan and flew into the inner sect area. Not long after, they arrived at a mountain peak. There was a Grand Hall on the mountain peak.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Huo Quan into the main hall and saw an old man with white hair and a beard.</p><p>The old man had a smile on his face, but he exuded a sense of Majesty that made people not dare to look at him directly.</p><p>“Subordinate greets sect master!”</p><p>Huo Quan bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Disciple Lu Ming greets the sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming followed suit and bowed.</p><p>“Huo Quan, you may leave!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain waved his hand.</p><p>Huo Quan left respectfully, leaving only Lu Ming and the Dragon Boat Mountain in the hall.</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes flickered with a strange light as it sized Lu Ming up. For some reason, Lu Ming felt gooseb.u.mps all over his body when the Dragon Boat Mountain’s gaze swept over him. It was as if he was being stared at by an extremely terrifying venomous snake.</p><p>All of a sudden, a radiance emanated from Dragon boat’s body. Rays of blood-red divine power condensed into venomous snakes that pounced toward Lu Ming. They were filled with terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He had never expected that the sect master of Kong Xuan sect would try to kill him. He had never met him or offended him, so why would he do this?</p><p>Even though he knew that there was a huge difference between his cultivation and his opponent’s, Lu Ming would not give up without a fight. He retreated quickly.</p><p>However, as soon as Lu Ming retreated, the s.p.a.ce behind him seemed to have solidified and completely blocked his retreat.</p><p>Swoosh Swoosh Swoosh …</p><p>A few venomous snakes wrapped themselves around Lu Ming. They were formed from the divine power of the Dragon Boat. They were astonishingly powerful. The terrifying power rushed into Lu Ming’s body, and he felt a tearing pain.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, he had no time to hide. He unleashed all of his sovereign divine power, violet-gold in color as he charged at the venomous snakes.</p><p>At the same time, a red-gold armor appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This was the divine skill, nine stage Crimson Gold armor. When it was used, it was as if a suit of armor had covered the body.</p><p>“Divine-grade divine power, it really is divine-grade divine power, and it’s even a ruler’s divine power!”</p><p>The Dragon boats ‘eyes burned with pa.s.sion as they looked at the divine energy circulating around Lu Ming’s body. With a wave of their hands, the venomous snakes that were coiling around Lu Ming’s body disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Lu Ming felt his entire body relax. He could not help but gasp for air, a layer of cold sweat breaking out on his body.</p><p>“Sect master, what is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Dragon Boat Mountain with a gloomy expression.</p><p>No one would be in a good mood if she tried to kill him the moment they met.</p><p>“Not bad, not bad. You have indeed mastered divine-grade divine power!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s face was filled with joy as he repeatedly nodded his head. He was extremely excited.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The other party was only trying to test if he had mastered the divine-grade divine energy?</p><p>“Your name is Lu Ming, right? in the future, I will nurture you well and let you grow up as soon as possible!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain said.</p><p>“Thank you, sect leader!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
