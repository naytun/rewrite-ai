Everyone recognized that this was the symbol of an outer sect elder.</p><p>As for the other four, judging from their clothes, they had the symbol of an outer sect Deacon.</p><p>I’ve called you all here today to bring you to a place. It’ll be a trial for you, but it’ll also be an opportunity. It’ll be a benefit for you!</p><p>The outer sect elder said.</p><p>“Training? Welfare?”</p><p>Everyone was surprised.</p><p>that’s right. On the Kong Xuan planet, there’s a strange forest with a large number of plant life forms. These plant life forms are very strange. They have a kind of wood crystal in their bodies. This kind of wood crystal contains dense and pure energy. It’s very easy for ethereal G.o.d Realm experts to absorb and refine it. It’s a great help for acc.u.mulating and increasing divine power. It can help your cultivation base increase a step in a short time!</p><p>according to the sect’s rules, the forest only opens once every three thousand years. Therefore, all disciples who have joined in the past three thousand years can enter. Consider it a benefit for you to join the sect!</p><p>however, some of those plant life forms are very aggressive, and some of them are poisonous. They are dangerous, and can be considered a form of training for you!</p><p>The outer sect elder explained.</p><p>Everyone came to a sudden realization. Some people’s gazes were filled with eagerness. To have such benefits when one just entered the sect, it was indeed worthy of being a top sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The outer sect elder waved his hand, and a divine combat sword appeared. It then grew rapidly, becoming hundreds of miles wide and then dozens of miles wide.</p><p>“Go up, I’ll Take You There!”</p><p>The outer sect elders and four outer sect deacons landed on the divine weapon greatsword first.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the rest also flew onto the giant sword one by one.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The outer sect elder shouted. The huge sword turned into a rainbow light and flew into the distance at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were very stable on the giant sword. There were no fluctuations at all.</p><p>“What a fast speed. Is this the strength of a heavenly G.o.d?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the mountains, rivers, and other things that flitted past in his surroundings. He sighed in his heart.</p><p>It was too fast. Even with Lu Ming’s eyesight, he could not see the scenery that flashed past.</p><p>The outer sect elder of the Kong Xuan sect was at least a sky celestial. Such a person could use his body to cross the stars, so his speed was naturally amazing.</p><p>However, Kong Xuan planet was too big. Even if a heavenly G.o.d brought them there, it would still take some time.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked in one direction. He had sensed that someone was looking at him with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming looked over and saw a few young men. They immediately turned their heads and pretended as if nothing happened.</p><p>they have killing intent towards me. Are they Huang Wu’s people? ”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Lu Ming, those few people have the intention to kill you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered. Obviously, he had felt it too.</p><p>yes, I can feel it. We’re in a forest. Be careful!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while and then sat down cross-legged.</p><p>However, following that, Lu Ming could sense killing intent sweeping toward him from time to time. Although it was well hidden, Lu Ming’s spiritual senses were sharp and he could clearly sense it.</p><p>After a few hours, the giant sword stopped.</p><p>There was a huge mountain range ahead.</p><p>This mountain range was extremely vast. Ancient trees towered into the sky, and one could not see the end of it.</p><p>The area of this mountain range was probably dozens of times larger than the area of the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm combined.</p><p>this is our destination, the forest of plants. There are a lot of plants living in it. Although the plants are not very strong, and there are almost no existences above the true G.o.d Realm, you should know your own strength. Don’t lose your life because of greed!</p><p>also, you only have three months. After three months, you must come out. Go!</p><p>The outer sect elder waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, nearly 600 people turned into streaks of light and flew into the mountain range, rushing into The Endless Forest.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also flew toward the mountain of plants.</p><p>“Let’s go together!”</p><p>Xie nianjun appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. They flew for a while and then rushed into the vast mountain range of plants.</p><p>the four of you, go in and take a look. If a true G.o.d-level plant life form is really born, kill it!</p><p>After everyone had entered the mountain range, the outer sect elder instructed the four deacons.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The four deacons ‘figures flickered, and they also rushed into the mountain range of plants.</p><p>As for the outer sect elder, he was waiting outside.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun landed in a forest. It was quiet in the forest. Other than the sound of the wind, there was no other sound.</p><p>Other than plants, there were no other living beings.</p><p>The three of them observed for a while, and then went deep into the forest.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When Lu Ming pa.s.sed by an old vine, the old vine moved. Like a soft whip, it wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>On the old vine, there were sharp thorns that glowed with a green light. It was obvious that they were poisonous.</p><p>“Plant life!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. A divine weapon sword appeared in his hand and he slashed out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The old vine was cut in half by Lu Ming and dark green liquid flowed out.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw an old vine uprooting itself and running wildly in an attempt to escape.</p><p>“You still want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ROC wings technique and caught up to the old vine in a flash. He slashed the root of the old vine. The old vine twitched a few times and stopped moving.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming broke open the old vine and found a green crystal the size of a finger. It was a wood crystal and it contained a very rich energy essence.</p><p>“Let’s check the energy.”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and inhaled, swallowing the wood crystal.</p><p>Immediately, the wood crystal turned into rolling energy and poured into the divine fire. Soon, the energy of the wood crystal was directly transformed into divine power.</p><p>“As expected, it can be directly absorbed and transformed!” Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>Refining this wood crystal was even faster than refining a spirit strengthening pill.</p><p>However, that old vine was only at the first level of the ethereal G.o.d Realm, so it didn’t have much energy.</p><p>Then, the three of them continued forward.</p><p>However, after walking for a while, he did not find any traces of plant life.</p><p>Not all the plants in the forest were plant life forms. Many of them were not plant life forms, but just ordinary plants.</p><p>if this plant life form doesn’t take the initiative to attack, it’ll be exactly the same as ordinary plants. It’ll be very difficult to discover it!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianjun frowned. That was indeed the case.</p><p>If the plant life form didn’t take the initiative to attack, they might not be able to discover it even if it was right next to them.</p><p>Lu Ming, try QiuQiu. QiuQiu is a metallic life form, similar to plant life forms. It’s a special life form. Maybe you can sense it!</p><p>Xie nianqing suggested.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
