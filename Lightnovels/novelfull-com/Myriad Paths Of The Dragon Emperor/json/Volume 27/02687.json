It was only the first stage, but it had already broken through Huang Chengan’s second stage divine skill.</p><p>However, the battle formula also helped.</p><p>After cultivating the ‘battle’ formula, the power of any divine skill or secret skill would be enhanced and he would be stronger than others. In addition, the three apocalyptic strikes was already powerful to begin with. Hence, Lu Ming broke through the second stage of the opponent at the first stage.</p><p>Lu Ming held his long spear and stood on the life-and-death battle stage like an invincible G.o.d of War. For a moment, he was the center of attention.</p><p>“Are there any more battles?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings. As he spoke, he took out a pile of divine crystals and absorbed the energy in them to recover his divine energy.</p><p>The use of a divine skill consumed a lot of divine power. Although he had only used one move, Lu Ming’s divine power was greatly consumed.</p><p>After all, his current cultivation was still low!</p><p>Those who were swept by Lu Ming’s gaze turned pale and did not dare to look him in the eye. Even the few geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking looked gloomy.</p><p>Huang Chengan was ranked 98th on the virtual G.o.d List, far superior to Dongfang Hao. He had even cultivated the divine skill to the second level. With his current combat strength, he might be ranked higher, but he had still been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>Although some of the people present were ranked higher than Huang Chengan, they were not that much higher. They had no confidence that they would be able to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>For a time, no one actually went up.</p><p>“Who else is there?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again, his eyes even brighter.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice was heard. In the distance, a figure came over like a whirlwind and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>It was a scrawny young man with Crimson skin. It was obvious that he was not human, but Lu Ming could not tell what race he was at the moment.</p><p>it’s a Scorpion Tiger! It’s ranked 51st on the virtual G.o.d ranking!</p><p>Many people were shocked when they saw the red-skinned young man.</p><p>“The Scorpion Tiger is about to make its move. I wonder if Lu Ming dares to accept the challenge!”</p><p>Xie Hu’s strength is far above Huang Chengan’S. I heard that Xie Hu once had a huge battle with a first stage true G.o.d expert. Although he was no match, he still managed to escape!</p><p>“I’ve also heard about it!”</p><p>Many people started to discuss intensely.</p><p>The gap between the ethereal G.o.d Realm and the true G.o.d Realm was a big realm, which was a big gap between their powers.</p><p>It was very difficult for a nihility G.o.d to fight a true G.o.d. Let alone a battle, it was extremely difficult for him to even escape.</p><p>One could see how strong the Scorpion Tiger was.</p><p>“He’s ranked 51st on the virtual G.o.d ranking list?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, a strong fighting spirit rising from his body.</p><p>“I’ll bet with you on a fourfold divine skill. If you lose, you have to give me ten million divine crystals. If I lose, the fourfold divine skill is yours!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger took out a scroll.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming accepted the challenge.</p><p>A fourfold divine skill could only be cultivated to the fourth fold at most. Lu Ming did not think much of it. The ninefold Crimson Gold armor and the three apocalyptic strikes that he cultivated were ninefold divine skills that could be cultivated to the ninth fold.</p><p>However, the market value of a quadruple divine skill was extremely high. It could be sold for tens of millions of divine crystals. Naturally, Lu Ming would not reject it.</p><p>The two of them gave the divine crystals and the scroll to a Deacon elderly.</p><p>“Lu Ming actually accepted the challenge. He’s really bold!”</p><p>bold? I think he’s just greedy. However, Huang Chengan and Dongfang Hao can’t compare to the Scorpion Tiger. Lu Ming is definitely no match for it!</p><p>look at how confident Lu Ming is. Could it be that he still has a trump card? we’ll just wait and see!</p><p>This time, it was different from the previous time. Some people felt that Lu Ming was unfathomable and might have a trump card. They were not very sure that Lu Ming would lose without a doubt.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>On the fighting ring, the two’s auras exploded and the waves of Shen power first collided.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger moved. Its body was thin, but its explosive power was shocking. It charged at Lu Ming with shocking speed. A blood-red sword appeared in its hand, and it stabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming only saw a blood-red sword light stabbing toward him at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step back and quickly retreated. He swept his long spear horizontally at the Scorpion Tiger.</p><p>However, the Scorpion Tiger changed its stance and dodged Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>you want to use this move to block me? it’s useless. Multi-story Sword Art!</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger’s cold voice came out of its mouth. Then, beams of sword light bloomed from its hands, densely packed, and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Each sword light was extremely fast.</p><p>“The second level of the divine skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The Scorpion Tiger’s divine skill had also been cultivated to the second level. From the looks of it, it was even more mature than Huang Chengan.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. His divine energy surged and he thrust his spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stunning spear light lit up again, like a star in the night sky.</p><p>The first move of the three apocalyptic strikes was used once again. Wherever the spear radiance pa.s.sed, the Scorpion Tiger’s sword radiance was constantly shattered.</p><p>Just as the Scorpion Tiger was about to end up like Huang Chengan, his body suddenly trembled and he forcefully shifted a few hundred meters away, avoiding Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>“A speed-type G.o.dly skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger had not only cultivated an offensive divine skill to the second level, but it had also mastered a speed divine skill. Just now, it had forcefully moved sideways with its speed divine skill and avoided Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>it’s so powerful. The Scorpion Tiger has cultivated a speed-type divine skill. It’s only on virtual G.o.d-level, but it’s so strong!</p><p>he’s indeed powerful. No wonder he’s a genius ranked 51st on the virtual G.o.d ranking list!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>It was already impressive for a ninth tier void G.o.d Realm martial artist to cultivate a divine skill to the first tier. However, the Scorpion Tiger had cultivated several divine skills. It was indeed terrifying.</p><p>Based on this alone, he was far above Huang Chengan.</p><p>Lu Ming’s unique skill can’t hit the Scorpion Tiger. He’s probably going to lose!</p><p>he will definitely lose. With his Shen power, he will definitely not be able to use much of his finishing move. He will definitely lose!</p><p>“He’s finally going to lose! Hahaha!”</p><p>Some people laughed.</p><p>your attacks are useless against me. Just stand there and get hit!</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger said coldly. Then, its body moved and it charged toward Lu Ming again. Its speed was several times faster than before.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger’s figure would appear on Lu Ming’s left and right at times, and its sword light bloomed continuously, slashing at Lu Ming’s vital points.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and tried his best to block it.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in a row and Lu Ming retreated continuously.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger’s voice rang out, and its attacks became even more intense and violent.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming revealed a flaw.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>The Scorpion Tiger’s eyes lit up. It became one with the sword and used its strongest move. It turned into a crimson sword light and rushed through Lu Ming’s flaw, killing him.</p><p>Lu Ming could not avoid this move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
