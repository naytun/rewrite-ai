Although the old gold was not very precious, there was a lot of it!</p><p>QiuQiu had gobbled up a huge underground hole in the underground s.p.a.ce of this area. It was unknown how many Chen Jin it had swallowed.</p><p>On the surface of QiuQiu, there was a radiance that spread out. It swelled and shrank at times. This continued for a while before it stabilized.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed that QiuQiu had already reached fourth-level void G.o.d-level!</p><p>Even Lu Ming was shocked by the speed of his improvement.</p><p>When he first got QiuQiu on myriad Gold Star, it was only at first-stage virtual G.o.d Realm. It had only been a few years, but it had already reached fourth-stage virtual G.o.d Realm.</p><p>It wasn’t that easy to advance to the virtual G.o.d Realm. It wasn’t something that the heavenly Emperor realm could compare to. However, QiuQiu seemed to have no bottlenecks at all. As long as it had precious metals, it could keep advancing.</p><p>the primeval universe is really wonderful. There are even such creatures. However, the more abnormal they are, the better!</p><p>Lu Ming could not stop smiling.</p><p>QiuQiu bounced a few times in the air and flew to Lu Ming’s side. It shrank rapidly and turned into a bangle that wrapped around Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and was about to go out to find out more.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a violent war drum sounded, and even the cave abode began to shake.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>Outside, a loud roar could be heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and rushed out of the cave abode.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked the moment he rushed out of the cave abode.</p><p>In the sky above the mine, many figures were flying around, each of them exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>The experts of the yuanluo Palace were all experts of the palace. This time, the number of experts from the palace was shocking. There were at least a thousand of them.</p><p>And now, the zhengtian Army of chenjin mine had only left about 400 experts to guard the place.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>The experts of the yuanluo Palace swooped down and attacked the righteous Army.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and some of the righteous Army’s experts were immediately killed!</p><p>There were too many people from the yuanluo Palace, almost three times the number of the righteous Army. The battle was completely one-sided if two or three of them joined forces to deal with one person from the righteous Army.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed out, two people charged at him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid of them at all. One of them was on third-level void G.o.d-level while the other was on fourth-level void G.o.d-level.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over directly. The meteor spear appeared and he thrust it forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two dazzling spear lights pierced out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The third-level void G.o.d Realm expert was pierced by the spear radiance and died on the spot. Although the fourth-level void G.o.d Realm expert blocked the attack, he was also forced to retreat.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The fourth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert was shocked.</p><p>Previously, he saw that Lu Ming was merely at the transformation void martial stage and thought that he could kill him easily. He did not expect that he had kicked an iron plate.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After Lu Ming repelled the person, he continued to attack with his spear. The long spear vibrated and rays of spear radiance shot out.</p><p>The other party tried his best to block, but it was still difficult to win. He retreated continuously and was in danger.</p><p>that brat is still here. We must kill him. Kill him!</p><p>At this moment, not far away, a few people flew over and stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s them …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Two of them were the two fifth-level void G.o.d existences who had escaped from him and QiuQiu previously. This time, these two people had brought two other experts to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>The other two’s auras were terrifying, even stronger than those at the fifth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>He was an existence at the sixth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>this person’s talent is heaven-defying! He must be killed!</p><p>One of them fixed his gaze on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Today, he will die without a doubt!”</p><p>A sixth level void G.o.d Realm existence said.</p><p>The four of them charged at Lu Ming with all their might. Before they even reached him, they had already launched attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming did not take it head-on. He retreated quickly.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>The five people were in hot pursuit as they approached Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>“QiuQiu, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew out, turning into a huge metal ball with a diameter of ten meters. It smashed down on a fifth-level void G.o.d-level existence.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>That fifth-level void G.o.d Realm existence knew how powerful QiuQiu was, so he retreated rapidly and dodged QiuQiu’s attack.</p><p>be careful! This metal ball has the attack power of a sixth level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert!</p><p>A fifth-level void G.o.d Realm existence reminded.</p><p>“It’s fine. I’ll block this metal ball. You guys go and kill that kid!”</p><p>A sixth level void G.o.d Realm burly man held a steel whip in his hand and rushed toward QiuQiu. He lashed out with the whip, and the s.p.a.ce whistled with extremely shocking power.</p><p>QiuQiu also threw itself at the man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a terrifying explosion, and the result was that the sixth level void G.o.d Realm burly man spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>Now that QiuQiu had advanced to the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm, its combat strength had skyrocketed, and it was not something a sixth level void G.o.d Realm existence could compare to.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The other three people’s faces changed drastically, and they had expressions of disbelief.</p><p>They had wanted to rush over to kill Lu Ming but they were not on guard against the metal ball.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After QiuQiu injured the burly man at the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm, it smashed toward the two existences at the fifth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>The two of them were caught off guard and were hit directly. After two screams, they died on the spot.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>The sixth-level void G.o.d-level existence’s expression changed drastically. He retreated rapidly and put some distance between him and QiuQiu.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At that moment, a roar came from the sky. It was a ninth-level void G.o.d Realm expert from the righteous Army.</p><p>The righteous Army was no match for the yuanluo Palace. The difference in numbers was too great. A large number of experts had fallen in the first exchange. In just a short while, about 100 experts had fallen.</p><p>“You want to leave? none of you will be able to leave today!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded, and a few terrifying figures charged toward the ninth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert from the righteous Army.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two sides collided.</p><p>The figures from the yuanluo Palace were all at the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm, and there were three of them.</p><p>Three against one, there was no suspense.</p><p>In just a few moves, the expert from the righteous Army let out an unwilling roar and was killed in the air.</p><p>“Kill them all, don’t leave a single one alive!”</p><p>A ninth level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert from the yuanluo Palace ordered.</p><p>“Charge, charge out!”</p><p>“Gather and charge out!”</p><p>let’s go! someone from the righteous Army shouted. The remaining 300 or so people rushed in one direction and gathered together.</p><p>“QiuQiu, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands to call QiuQiu and rushed toward the group of people.</p><p>Now, they could only survive if they attacked together. Otherwise, they would all die!</p><p>Lu Ming and QiuQiu rushed toward the righteous Army.</p><p>“Kill that brat! We must kill him!”</p><p>The sixth-level void G.o.d-level man who was injured by QiuQiu earlier roared with a knife-like killing intent.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, a terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
