I must pay close attention to him!</p><p>Although he was not very sure that Lu Ming had mastered the path of domination, the path of domination was no small matter. If it was true, it would be terrible.</p><p>“He’s passed, he’s passed!”</p><p>nest, it’s actually so simple. I thought it would be difficult.</p><p>it seems like it’s even easier than the tower Challenge. It seems like the pavilion master’s test is even more rigorous!</p><p>that’s right. If that kid can pass, I’ll definitely pass!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had passed the test easily, many people relaxed and smiled.</p><p>They all thought that the test set by the elder in brocade was very simple.</p><p>“Who’s next?”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe said.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Immediately, hundreds of people shouted and rushed toward the stone gate.</p><p>Since the assessment was so simple, he had to go up earlier to show off.</p><p>“One by one!”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe said coldly, and a powerful aura pressed down, making the hundreds of young men stop.</p><p>“You, first!”</p><p>The elder in brocade pointed at a handsome young man.</p><p>“Haha, I’ll go first!”</p><p>The young man laughed and rushed towards the stone door, as if he was going to rush through it in one breath.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After he stepped through the stone door, the stone door immediately lit up. A few rays of divine light danced out and blasted towards the young man.</p><p>The young man looked relaxed. Divine power burst forth and he waved his palm. He wanted to learn from Lu Ming and destroy the divine light with ease.</p><p>However, the young man’s expression changed as soon as he came into contact with the divine light. His face was full of disbelief, and then he screamed miserably as his body flew backward and fell heavily on the ground. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his body twitched non-stop.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>How could this young man be sent flying without even being able to withstand the first attack?</p><p>Just now, when Lu Ming passed the test, it was clearly very easy.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>The young man who had been sent flying struggled to get up and swallowed a healing pill to stabilize his injuries.</p><p>“Failure, next!”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe said coldly.</p><p>“Wait a moment, senior, wait a moment!”</p><p>The young man who had failed shouted.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>The brocade-robed elder said.</p><p>senior, it’s not fair. I don’t think it’s fair. When that kid passed through the stone door, the attack wasn’t that strong. Why did it become so strong when I passed through?”</p><p>The young man cried out, feeling wronged.</p><p>He could clearly see that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the transformation void martial stage while he was at the second level of the void God stage. There was no reason why Lu Ming could pass while he could not.</p><p>“Impudent! You dare to doubt the envoy?”</p><p>The cloud Peak Pavilion master shouted coldly.</p><p>The young man immediately broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe raised his hand to stop the cloud Peak Pavilion master. Then, he glanced at the crowd and said,” “Let me tell you, my test is absolutely fair!”</p><p>however, I can also tell you that the attack of this stone door will be different according to the person who enters. The stone door will be adjusted according to the person’s age, the level of divine power, and so on. Only those with higher overall talent can pass through. Ordinary people will not be able to pass through. Do you understand?”</p><p>also, the Qin heavenly thirteen clans never look at your cultivation level when recruiting disciples. Because, to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, cultivation level has no meaning. Even if you are a heavenly deity, to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, it wouldn’t be of much use.</p><p>the Qin heaven thirteen clans take in disciples based on talent and potential!</p><p>The voice of the elder in the brocade robe sounded in everyone’s ears.</p><p>Indeed, to the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, the difference in cultivation didn’t mean much. In their eyes, there was no difference between a first level void God Realm and a ninth level void God Realm.</p><p>What they wanted was talent and potential.</p><p>However, the handsome young man still looked unwilling.</p><p>On what basis could a transformation void martial stage person pass while he, who was at the second level of the void God Realm, couldn’t?</p><p>it seems like you’re still unwilling to give up. However, do you really think that you can defeat him just because your cultivation is higher than his? ”</p><p>The brocade-robed elder said indifferently.</p><p>“Of course I can defeat him. I only need three moves, no, I only need one move to suppress him!”</p><p>The handsome young man shouted and looked at Lu Ming indignantly.</p><p>“Oh? Since that’s the case, I’ll let you have a battle and make you admit your defeat. Little fellow, are you willing to fight?”</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked to the handsome young man.</p><p>“Kid, I’ll suppress you with one move and let everyone know who’s qualified to take part in the thirteen clans” disciple recruitment test!”</p><p>The handsome young man said arrogantly. A cold look flashed in his eyes. Then, he rushed out and made a move with all his strength. A huge palm print fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He stood there without moving as if he did not see the other party’s attack.</p><p>When the palm force of the other party was close, Lu Ming pointed with his finger.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The finger force was like a spear ray, directly penetrating the opponent’s palm print and shooting into the opponent’s shoulder.</p><p>The handsome young man let out a blood-curdling screech as his shoulder was pierced through. The powerful force sent him flying to the edge of the square, and he fell heavily on the ground, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The scene suddenly became quiet.</p><p>One move, just one move, Lu Ming defeated the handsome young man. Just like when he passed through the stone door, he did so easily.</p><p>“What a powerful genius!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the transformation void martial stage, but he was able to defeat a second-level void God Realm expert. It was truly unbelievable.</p><p>After Lu Ming pointed with his finger, he turned around and walked back.</p><p>He was only a second-level virtual God who could control ordinary divine power. To Lu Ming, he was not challenging at all.</p><p>“What a powerful divine power. If he breaks through to the martial God Realm, even if it’s not divine-grade divine power, it’ll be King-grade divine power. I didn’t expect that the chaotic astral River would actually have such a powerful heaven’s favorite!”</p><p>The elder’s eyes brightened.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Kang long, situ Xiao, and the rest snorted coldly. They were very displeased to see Lu Ming in the limelight.</p><p>Situ Feng, on the other hand, looked calm. No one could tell what he was thinking.</p><p>do you see this? my stone door is absolutely fair. The assessment will continue. A loss is a loss, and a win is a win. If anyone has any more doubts, they will be disqualified immediately!</p><p>The brocade-robed elder announced in an overbearing manner.</p><p>Earlier on, he had agreed to the handsome young man’s challenge mainly because he wanted to see Lu Ming fight. Otherwise, if the handsome young man dared to doubt him, he would have long been chased away.</p><p>The test continued. Another young man stepped forward, but he also failed and was sent flying out of the stone door..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
