After walking through the pa.s.sageway, Lu Ming came across a courtyard.</p><p>It turned out that the pa.s.sage just now was just a small path on the side. This was the real main courtyard.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Outside the courtyard came a series of rumbles. It was obvious that the gate of the building was right outside the courtyard. The palace Master of the yuan Luo Palace and the others were bombarding the formation at the gate.</p><p>They never would have thought that someone had already entered the building before they could even break the formation on the door.</p><p>“I’m going to speed up!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he went into the courtyard.</p><p>There was a large hall in the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes immediately swept across the room.</p><p>The hall was empty. Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>However, there was an inner hall behind the main hall. Lu Ming walked into the inner hall.</p><p>The inner hall was a little messy, and there was a huge platform.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look and recognized the platform. It should be used for forging weapons. There were some materials piled up randomly around the corner.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu had already started eating. It stretched out two tentacles, grabbed the ingredients, and started eating.</p><p>“This is Star silver, black sky Gold …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and he discovered two extremely precious refining materials.</p><p>Star silver and black sky Gold were both materials that could be used to craft middle-grade divine artifacts. They were extremely precious.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and quickly grabbed the star silver and black sky Gold and kept them.</p><p>Lu Ming only recognized these. There were many others that he did not recognize. Most likely, their levels would not be low.</p><p>Lu Ming and QiuQiu swept away all the materials like the wind.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu glared at Lu Ming angrily, as if it was saying that Lu Ming had s.n.a.t.c.hed its food.</p><p>“You, these materials aren’t cheap. Take them out and Exchange them for something else for you to eat!”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled.</p><p>The materials that could be used to craft middle-grade divine artifacts were definitely priceless.</p><p>However, apart from these materials, he did not find anything else of value.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that this should be the cave abode of an expert. The expert was refining weapons here and had thrown some useless materials on the corner. They were the materials that Lu Ming had collected earlier.</p><p>However, the things that the expert didn’t care about were also valuable to others.</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up happily but did not discover anything else.</p><p>He exited the inner hall and returned to the outer hall. He noticed that there was a corridor on the side of the outer hall. Lu Ming followed the corridor to the back and saw another courtyard. There was a tall building in front of the courtyard but the door of the courtyard was closed. There was also a large array set up on the door.</p><p>Lu Ming tried but he realized that he could not enter at all. He was blocked by the large array.</p><p>“Looks like I’ll have to take a detour again!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and then went back the way he came. He came to the side pa.s.sage and exited from the gap that QiuQiu had bitten open.</p><p>“How do we fill up this gap?”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>Later on, if the yuanluo Hall Master and the others broke the formation and entered, they would probably find this gap.</p><p>QiuQiu seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind. It opened its mouth and a sticky black liquid spurted out. It looked like a black liquid metal.</p><p>The black liquid metal poured into the gap and quickly solidified, completely blocking the gap.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little dumbfounded. He speculated that the black liquid metal was the impurities that QiuQiu had eaten?</p><p>Anyway, no matter what, the gap was blocked. Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Then, QiuQiu continued to refuel and gnaw on the old gold mine as it headed inside the building.</p><p>When it estimated that it had already pa.s.sed the door, QiuQiu started to bite the black wall again.</p><p>A few days later, QiuQiu bit through the wall and Lu Ming entered through the gap. He realized that he had already entered the building behind the door.</p><p>There were many secret rooms here. Lu Ming began to search.</p><p>In the beginning, a few of the secret rooms were empty.</p><p>He only discovered it when he arrived at the largest secret room.</p><p>There were a few shelves around the secret room, and there were some Jade bottles on the shelves.</p><p>“A divine pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The divine elixir was very useful for the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>There were actually some divine pills here.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a Jade bottle and realized that there were runes carved on it. These runes were used to seal the Jade bottle to prevent the medicinal effects from being lost.</p><p>However, many years had pa.s.sed and the power of the seal had weakened. Lu Ming used the path of domination and broke the seal very quickly.</p><p>Then, he opened the Jade bottle. Immediately, a thick medicinal fragrance filled the air.</p><p>“There’s still medicinal effects!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not know what the divine pill in the Jade bottle was called or what effects it had.</p><p>Lu Ming knew nothing about the divine pill.</p><p>I don’t care. I’ll keep it first. I’ll slowly identify it when I go out!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept all the Jade bottles. There were more than fifty of them.</p><p>After keeping it, Lu Ming sized up the secret room.</p><p>In the middle of the secret room, there was a dark-colored mark.</p><p>“This should be a secret room for alchemy. The mark in the middle should be where the alchemy furnace was placed!”</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not know much about divine pills, he was also an Alchemist in the heaven realm. He was very familiar with the habitual steps of alchemy. He could speculate many things just by looking at the layout of the secret room.</p><p>It was obvious that this was a secret alchemy room. However, the owner of this place had left with the alchemy furnace and most of the elixirs.</p><p>Perhaps, some of the pills that were not important to the cave abode’s owner had been left behind, and they were the ones that Lu Ming had obtained previously.</p><p>However, the owner of this cave abode was not a trivial matter. Even if the owner of the cave abode did not like it, it did not mean that Lu Ming did not like it.</p><p>After walking out of the secret room, Lu Ming began to search again. Then, he found a pa.s.sageway. However, this pa.s.sageway was also set up with an array. Lu Ming could not pa.s.s through it at all.</p><p>“This cave is really big. There are more inside, then … Let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was all smiles.</p><p>This cave dwelling had obviously been abandoned by its owner. Almost all the good things had been taken away, but even if there were some things left that were not important to the owner, they were still valuable treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming went out through the hole that they had come in through. QiuQiu did the same thing again. It spewed out liquid metal and blocked the hole. Then, they continued to dig and went deeper into the cave abode.</p><p>After moving forward for a while, QiuQiu continued to bite a hole in the stone wall and Lu Ming entered it.</p><p>This time, the place they entered was a little special.</p><p>They seemed to have entered a pa.s.sageway. The pa.s.sageway was very large, at least a hundred meters in diameter, and smooth walls surrounded them on all four sides.</p><p>It was pitch black in front of the pa.s.sage, and no one knew where it led to.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and walked along the pa.s.sage.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying whistling sound was heard in the pa.s.sage. Then, a strong suction force was produced in the pa.s.sage, sucking Lu Ming in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
