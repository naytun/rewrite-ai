However, at this moment, they had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>That was because the crystal ball test could not be faked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Huang Wu who was at fifth level void G.o.d Realm with his demiG.o.d-level cultivation base. How was this possible?</p><p>This was simply like a fantasy story!</p><p>Monstrous, a true monstrous genius!</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with grave eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. Of course, he knew what the people around him were up to.</p><p>Previously, he had defeated Huang Wu with the intention of establishing his might.</p><p>Lu Ming had experienced too much along the way. He naturally understood that no matter where he went, newbies would be bullied. Therefore, only by showing his strong abilities would others be in awe of him. He would have less trouble then.</p><p>Otherwise, how could he cultivate if a bunch of people kept provoking him?</p><p>This way, there would be fewer outer sect disciples who would dare to provoke him.</p><p>After registering his information, the elder pa.s.sed an ident.i.ty token to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took the ident.i.ty token, turned around, and left the place.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Lu Ming had just walked out of the human affairs Hall when someone shouted from behind. Deng Yu had caught up to him.</p><p>“Brother Deng, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>brother Lu, I’ve just heard that Huang Wu’s background is extraordinary!</p><p>Deng Yu said.</p><p>“Oh? What’s his background?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I heard that Deng Yu’s big brother is a heaven’s favorite among the inner disciples. He’s very powerful. Also, his big brother’s master is an inner elder, and he’s exceptionally powerful!</p><p>Deng Yu said with a solemn expression.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He did not expect Huang Wu to have such a background. However, since he had already done it, there was nothing to be afraid of. He would deal with it as it came.</p><p>“Brother Deng, thank you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After knowing Huang Wu’s background, Deng Yu still dared to come and tell him. He was a good person and was worth befriending. He did not see the others, but they had already stayed far away from Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them chatted as they returned to their residence.</p><p>Back in his room, Lu Ming sat cross-legged.</p><p>With a thought, an exquisite dagger appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>This dagger was given to him by the ancestor of technique. He had asked him to bring it to a woman named Yuexin from the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>However, according to the ancestor of technique, Yuexin was the daughter of an important figure in the Kong Xuan sect and was most likely not in the outer sect. He was in the outer sect now, so it would not be easy to find Yuexin.</p><p>“When there’s time, find someone to investigate!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself. Then, he kept the dagger and took out a Jade bottle.</p><p>The Jade bottle contained the spirit strengthening pill.</p><p>The spirit strengthening pill could increase the strength of his divine power and refine it. It was extremely helpful for void G.o.d Realm cultivators to break through.</p><p>After one’s cultivation reached the demiG.o.d realm, there was no need to comprehend any Dao, especially demiG.o.ds and virtual G.o.ds. As long as one refined their divine power, their cultivation would naturally increase.</p><p>However, without the help of divine pills or natural treasures, this process would be very slow.</p><p>After consuming a spirit strengthening pill, Lu Ming began to refine it.</p><p>The spirit strengthening pill turned into waves of energy and gushed into the divine fire in Lu Ming’s dantian. It was continuously refined by the divine fire and then transformed into divine power.</p><p>At the same time, the rich divine Qi in the surrounding s.p.a.ce continued to gather towards Lu Ming. It surged into Lu Ming’s body and was refined by him, slowly turning into divine power.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming finished refining a spirit strengthening pill and ended his cultivation.</p><p>“The divine Qi on Kong Xuan planet is too dense. Cultivating here is several times faster than cultivating in the chaotic astral River. If this continues, I’ll be able to become a G.o.d in less than a year!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a faint smile.</p><p>After a few days of cultivation, Lu Ming felt that the divine fire in his body had grown stronger. There were traces of divine power flowing out of the divine fire and flowing into the meridians in his body.</p><p>It was a slow process for a demiG.o.d to advance to the virtual G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Most people would have to stay for a long time.</p><p>However, the divine Qi on Kong Xuan planet was extremely rich. With the help of the spirit strengthening pill, Lu Ming was confident that he could become a G.o.d within a year.</p><p>“Someone’s there?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sensed that someone was flying in from outside his courtyard and stopped at the entrance.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The door to his courtyard was pushed open.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. In a flash, he left the room and arrived at the courtyard.</p><p>A young man walked in from the door.</p><p>The man was dressed in fine clothes and had a cold and arrogant expression. He glanced at Lu Ming and smiled.”You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Although this person was smiling, his tone still revealed a trace of superiority.</p><p>“That’s right. I’m lu Ming. Did Huang Wu send you here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>No. the young man in luxurious clothes shook his head. Huang Wu is not qualified to send me here. Someone wants to see you. Perhaps this is a great opportunity for you!</p><p>“Someone wants to see me? A lucky chance?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He was new here and didn’t know anyone.</p><p>“That’s right, come with me!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes turned around and left after he finished speaking.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Initially, the att.i.tude of the young man in luxurious clothes made him uncomfortable and he did not want to go. However, he was indeed a little curious.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming followed him.</p><p>After walking out of the courtyard, they soared into the air and landed in a luxurious courtyard.</p><p>This courtyard was very luxurious. It was more than ten times larger than Lu Ming’s courtyard. Furthermore, its geographical location was very good and it was filled with divine Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming and the young man in luxurious clothes walked into the courtyard and saw a few tables and chairs in the courtyard. A few young men were sitting on the tables and chairs, drinking and chatting.</p><p>“Big brother Ying, I’ve brought the person!”</p><p>The young man in luxurious clothes cupped his fists towards a golden-haired young man, and then sat down at a table.</p><p>Sitting at the head of the table was a golden-haired young man. He had a dignified appearance and a strong aura. One look and one could tell that he was an expert.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The golden-haired young man and the other young men looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Sit!”</p><p>The golden-haired young man waved his hand and pointed to a table and chair.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He was sure that he had not seen these people before. However, he was not afraid and sat down at a table and chair.</p><p>I heard that you ranked first in the thirteen clans ‘a.s.sessment? ”</p><p>The golden-haired young man took a sip of wine and smiled.</p><p>“I was just lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no matter what, the fact that you’re first shows that you’re talented. To be honest, we’re under the Tianhong Saint son. We belong to the Tianhong faction!</p><p>The golden-haired youth said.</p><p>“The Tianhong Saint son? The Tianhong sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look.</p><p>you’ve just arrived, so you might not know yet. Let me tell you!</p><p>the Kong Xuan sect is extremely powerful and huge, ” the golden-haired young man said. there are as many experts as there are clouds in the sky. Other than the sect leader and some Supreme elders, the sect is divided into various factions, led by the Saint sons and saintesses …</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
