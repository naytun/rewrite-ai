Naturally, she was reluctant to part with him.</p><p>“Go, go. Cultivate well. In the future, I will visit you too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although he was also a little reluctant, he also understood that separation was the best choice.</p><p>not bad, little guy. You’re very talented and have a lot of opportunities. In the future, you might have a chance in the universe!</p><p>The middle-aged lady sized Lu Ming up as if she could see through him. There was a hint of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed bitterly in his heart. He knew that this beautiful middle-aged woman’s cultivation had probably reached an unbelievable level. His secret would most likely be seen through by her.</p><p>“I wonder if she has discovered the battle formula!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought in his heart.</p><p>The word ‘battle’ that Bai Ya had once mentioned was an extremely precious treasure even in the primeval universe. Many great figures would fight to the death for it.</p><p>If he was discovered by the beautiful middle-aged woman, who knew what the consequences would be.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming discovered that the word ‘battle’ in his sea of consciousness was shrinking rapidly. It was billions of times smaller than a speck of dust, as if it was afraid that the beautiful middle-aged woman would notice it.</p><p>Fortunately, the beautiful middle-aged woman didn’t seem to notice anything strange.</p><p>“Little fellow, you can be considered to have fate with my clan. I will give you a hand!”</p><p>With that, the middle-aged lady waved her hand and a stream of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming felt that all the energy in his body was about to be condensed into one, reaching the point of 10000 elements returning to one and igniting the divine fire.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming was grateful. He knew that the other party was helping him.</p><p>“See you again if we’re fated to!”</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman waved her hand and the bubble disappeared with dandan.</p><p>“See you again if we’re fated to!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then sat cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>&Nbsp; in his body, sovereign power surged like a river. Originally, he had also had a wisp of World Energy.</p><p>But now, this wisp of world power had been completely melted by the ruler’s power and transformed into it.</p><p>The only thing left in his meridians was the power of a G.o.d, nothing else.</p><p>Initially, if Lu Ming wanted to reach this stage, he would need a period of time to Polish it. He estimated that he would need at least more than ten years.</p><p>However, with the help of the beautiful middle-aged woman’s power, he had broken through directly.</p><p>“Congealing divine pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few more congealing divine pills and swallowed them in one go.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>With the help of the spirit congealing pill, his ruler’s power started to gather in his dantian.</p><p>Then, it kept on compressing.</p><p>Compress, compress again!</p><p>In the end, all the ruler’s power gathered into a ball in his dantian and kept compressing.</p><p>Huhu …</p><p>&Nbsp; when it was compressed to its limit, the sovereign power underwent an earth-shaking transformation. On the surface of the sovereign power, a flame suddenly began to spread.</p><p>In the beginning, the flame was small, but soon, the flame grew bigger and bigger, and finally burned fiercely.</p><p>Divine fire!</p><p>This was a divine fire, a divine fire formed from divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming had successfully ignited the divine fire. It meant that he had entered the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>&Nbsp; not long after, all of the G.o.d energy had been converted into divine fire.</p><p>Lu Ming had officially entered the demiG.o.d realm.</p><p>Of course, it was only a wisp of divine fire now, and the amount was not large.</p><p>Next, he needed to keep strengthening the divine fire and fill his body with divine power. Then, with the help of the divine power, his body would complete a transformation and turn into a divine body.</p><p>At that time, he would have stepped into the martial G.o.d Realm and become a G.o.d.</p><p>“Let’s test its power!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming ignited the divine fire and a thin layer of divine power spread out from his palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm cut through the void, making an ear-piercing sound.</p><p>“Divine power. The power of a G.o.d’s divine power is indeed much stronger than the power of a G.o.d!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>&Nbsp; although he only had a wisp of divine fire in his body, this was a G.o.d’s divine power that was far stronger than the G.o.d’s divine power from before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength did not decrease. Instead, it increased by another level.</p><p>Lu Ming was more confident about the second round of the a.s.sessment.</p><p>After becoming a demiG.o.d, he was only one step away from first-level virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>Lu Ming was confident that even if he did not unleash the full power of the ruler’s divine power, he would be able to suppress everyone.</p><p>He still had this bit of confidence.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming swallowed a few more congealing divine pills to completely consolidate his realm. Then, he entered the dream s.p.a.ce again to cultivate.</p><p>In these two years, they could freely enter and exit the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>Time flew by, and two years pa.s.sed in a flash.</p><p>Dream realm, trial grounds, Plains.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>At least a dozen fourth-tier virtual G.o.d-level wild beasts pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body moved like a ROC flying in the sky, easily avoiding the attacks of more than a dozen wild beasts. Then, he thrust his long spear forward, and more than a dozen spear gleams pierced toward these wild beasts.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>In an instant, more than a dozen wild beasts that were equivalent to fourth-level void G.o.d-level were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“The ROC wing technique has reached the sixth level. As for that spear technique, it has also reached the sixth level!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>This was what he had gained in the past two years.</p><p>The more one cultivated a divine skill, the harder it was to improve it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had used two years to cultivate two incomplete divine skills to the sixth level. If news of this spread, many people would be shocked.</p><p>There was no doubt that Lu Ming’s comprehension ability was the best of the best.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to create miracles in the heaven realm, control multiple ultimate maxims at the same time, and finally cultivate the path of domination.</p><p>&Nbsp; Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>At this time, pillars of light descended from the sky, enveloping everyone. Their figures disappeared, and in the next moment, they appeared on stone platforms.</p><p>The stone platforms were suspended in the air. Nearly 2000 stone platforms surrounded a huge battle platform.</p><p>This place was still the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in the sky above the fighting ring.</p><p>This figure was the host, the one the thirteen clans had chosen to host this test.</p><p>The empty s.p.a.ce on planet thousand spirits was once again filled with people.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were looking at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, there was a huge screen that completely reflected the situation in the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>Everyone could see the compet.i.tion in the dream s.p.a.ce through this screen.</p><p>Within the dream s.p.a.ce.</p><p>The figure above the fighting ring was a middle-aged man. His eyes swept across the crowd as he spoke.</p><p>for all of you to be able to enter the second round, you are all the elites of the Qin heaven star region in the past 1000 years. All of you already have the qualifications to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans!</p><p>however, all of you have to perform well next. The better you perform, the more you will be valued by the Qin heaven thirteen clans. In the future, when you enter the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the treatment you will receive will also be better. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Everyone roared, their eyes burning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
