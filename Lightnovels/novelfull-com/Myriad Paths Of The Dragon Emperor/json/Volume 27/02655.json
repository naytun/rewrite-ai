After you hand it over, you can choose a courtyard to stay in. Those who don’t hand it over are not qualified to stay. Let me tell you, those who don’t stay in a courtyard are not considered Kong Xuan sect disciples, and can only get out of the sect. Do you understand?”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said coldly.</p><p>Extortion!</p><p>This was blatant extortion.</p><p>Moreover, their appetites were astonishingly large. If each of them was given ten thousand divine crystals, then a hundred of them would be equivalent to one million divine crystals. What a huge sum of money was this?</p><p>“You guys … This is extortion! I’m going to tell elder Huo Quan about this!”</p><p>Some people roared, unwilling to be extorted.</p><p>“Bullshit, what extortion? You’re new to the Kong Xuan sect, so you should show respect to your senior brother, understand?”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man rebuked. His eyes flashed with a sinister light,” it’s fine if you don’t respect me, and it’s fine if you dare to tell the elders. However, you must be careful in the Kong Xuan sect from now on. Don’t blame me for not warning you if you’re crippled!</p><p>A threat!</p><p>It was a blatant threat!</p><p>Some people’s eyes flashed with fear.</p><p>They had just arrived and were unfamiliar with the place, so they simply couldn’t compete with these senior disciples. If the other party specifically came to find trouble with them, no one would be able to take it.</p><p>hurry up and hand it over. Whoever doesn’t hand it over, I guarantee that you won’t be able to stay in the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>The yellow-robed youth threatened.</p><p>I don’t believe that no one will take care of such a large Kong Xuan sect. I’ll go find elder Huo Quan and ask him to uphold justice!</p><p>A burly young man roared and turned to leave.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man shouted coldly. His figure flashed and he rushed towards the burly young man. His palm was like a knife and he struck at the burly young man.</p><p>The wind from the palm whistled, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>“5th level void God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s cultivation was at the 5th level of the void God Realm.</p><p>The burly young man turned around and shouted as he punched.</p><p>However, the burly young man’s cultivation was only at the third level of the void God Realm, which was too far away from the yellow-robed young man’s cultivation. The fist and palm collided, and the burly young man spat out a mouthful of blood. His arm was broken, and he flew a hundred meters away before falling to the ground and coughing up blood.</p><p>“This is the outcome of anyone who doesn’t obey!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s eyes were gloomy as he swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm.</p><p>But the others didn’t look too good.</p><p>Overbearing, too overbearing!</p><p>Moreover, the yellow-robed young man’s cultivation was extremely high. He was at the 5th level of the void God Realm.</p><p>In their group, no one had surpassed this cultivation.</p><p>The Qin heaven 13 clans recruited disciples once every 1000 years. Hence, they weren’t very old. Many of them hadn’t cultivated for more than 1000 years. Even those who had cultivated for longer didn’t exceed 2000 years. Their cultivation wouldn’t be very high.</p><p>The person with the highest cultivation base in Lu Ming’s group was also at fifth-level void God-level, which was the same as the yellow-robed young man.</p><p>However, the yellow-robed young man had joined the Kong Xuan sect a long time ago, so he must have cultivated an incomplete divine skill. Moreover, he must have reached a high level of mastery. Therefore, even those at the fifth level of the void God Realm were most likely not his match, so they did not dare to make a move.</p><p>After all, there were too few people like the Golden Sage and Hu ya. They had already reached the ninth level of the void God Realm at such a young age.</p><p>In the surrounding courtyards, some senior disciples were also using their spiritual senses to observe.</p><p>Huang Wu, you’re really overbearing. You’re attacking the new disciples again! what can we do? who asked him to have a big brother with a strong background? besides, other people want to save face, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t want face!</p><p>that’s right. We can only blame these new disciples for their bad luck. Pay ten thousand divine crystals for safety. I paid ten thousand a thousand years ago!</p><p>Some of the senior disciples were secretly communicating with each other.</p><p>“Hurry up and hand it over, I don’t have that much time to waste with you guys!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man, Huang Wu, swept his cold gaze across Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I’ll pay, I’ll pay!”</p><p>Finally, someone wavered. He took out 10000 divine crystals and handed them to Huang Wu.</p><p>“I’ll pay too!”</p><p>“I’ll pay!”</p><p>Many people came up one after another and handed over ten thousand divine crystals.</p><p>He had no choice but to lower his head, so he would just treat it as spending money to get rid of a disaster.</p><p>“Kid, it’s your turn!”</p><p>A young man beside Huang Wu cast a cold glance at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t have any divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming spread his hands casually and walked toward a courtyard.</p><p>“Brat, stop!”</p><p>Huang Wu coldly shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not seem to hear it and continued to move forward.</p><p>“I told you to stop, are you deaf?”</p><p>Huang Wu shouted.</p><p>“Of course I’m not deaf!”</p><p>As Lu Ming walked, he turned around and cast a glance at Huang Wu.”However, Who Do You Think You Are to stop just because you told me to?”</p><p>What?</p><p>Huang Wu was stunned!</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in this manner?</p><p>How dare a newbie talk to him like that?</p><p>He was not the only one. The senior disciples who were watching were also very surprised.</p><p>this kid is really a hot-headed boy. He dared to say that about Huang Wu. I’m afraid he’ll end up in a miserable state!</p><p>it’s hard to say. Since he dares to ignore Huang Wu like this, could he be a heaven’s favorite from some major power?”</p><p>“This… I can’t say for sure!”</p><p>The senior disciples were all moved. It wasn’t impossible.</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, other than a few extremely terrifying races and the Qin heaven thirteen clans, there were also some other powerful forces and races. These forces would also choose young geniuses to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>For example, the Tigermen tribe was like this!</p><p>If he came from a powerful clan, it was normal for him to have such confidence.</p><p>Huang Wu was stunned for a moment, but he had also thought of this.</p><p>His eyes glinted as he glanced at Lu Ming.”Kid, you’ve got guts. Which Galaxy are you from?”</p><p>“Chaotic astral River!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“What… What? Chaotic astral River, that astral River of ruins?”</p><p>Some of the senior disciples, including Huang Wu, were stunned.</p><p>“He really came from the chaotic astral River?”</p><p>Huang Wu asked the other new disciple to confirm.</p><p>“Yes, yes, he is indeed from the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>The new disciple nodded.</p><p>Huang Wu immediately felt relieved.</p><p>“That brat is finished. He’s from the chaotic astral River, and he actually dares to be so arrogant. He’s really…”</p><p>Some senior disciples shook their heads.</p><p>In their eyes, it was already a miracle for a trifling person from the chaotic astral River to join the Kong Xuan sect, yet he still dared to be so arrogant.</p><p>As expected of someone from a small place, he was short-sighted!</p><p>Some of the senior disciples muttered to themselves.</p><p>As for Huang Wu, his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Brat, kneel down and apologize for what you just said. Then hand over a hundred thousand divine crystals, and we’ll let this matter go. Otherwise, I’ll break your limbs and make you pay the price!”</p><p>Huang Wu said in a mocking tone.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, turned around and continued to walk.</p><p>“You… You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Huang Wu flew into a rage. Like an eagle, he pounced at Lu Ming, his palm as sharp as a blade, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air. His divine power condensed into a long spear and he swept it out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
