He’s rising so quickly!</p><p>his score has also soared. He’s already at 367 points. Also, his ranking has already charged into the top 2000!</p><p>he’s starting to exert his strength. He must have been delayed by something!</p><p>I’ve risen again. I’m now more than 400 points. I’m ranked 1378!</p><p>Some people from the chaotic astral River suddenly cried out.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had made it into the top one hundred before and then stopped. However, many people in the chaotic astral River were still paying attention to Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s ranking suddenly soared and these people immediately cried out.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan also looked over. The moment they saw it, they both let out a cold Humph and their expressions were extremely unhappy.</p><p>it’s only a thousand or so. There’s still a long way to go before the top hundred!</p><p>that’s right. The further we go, the more experts we’ll be left behind. Without Feng ‘er’s talent, we’ll be killed sooner or later, and our ranking will drop drastically!</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan said unhappily.</p><p>However, the moment situ haonan finished speaking, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>Because in a certain area, situ Xiao’s ranking had suddenly dropped.</p><p>Originally, situ Xiao had already made it to the 300th place in that area. However, at this moment, his ranking had dropped drastically, falling to the 500th place.</p><p>There could only be one reason for him to drop so many ranks all of a sudden. He had been killed, and his points had been halved. That was why he had dropped so badly.</p><p>“Hahaha, situ haonan, did you just say your son, situ Xiao? You’re right. I have to say, you really have a jinx’s mouth!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique laughed heartily. He was extremely carefree.</p><p>“Fa Ming, you …”</p><p>Situ haonan’s chest heaved up and down, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Just now, he had mocked Lu Ming and situ Xiao was immediately killed. It matched his words too well.</p><p>It was as if he was deliberately slapping his face.</p><p>This coincidence made the other forces “leaders on the side couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Even Kang Ji Lian’s body was twitching as he tried his best not to laugh.</p><p>Situ haonan’s lips trembled in anger.</p><p>The cloud Peak Pavilion master looked on coldly.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, there are close to 1000 major and minor powers. It’s normal for them to fight and kill each other.</p><p>She was also happy to see such a situation. Only when the other powers were killing each other would her Yunfeng Pavilion be able to sit firmly as the Overlord of the chaotic astral River.</p><p>he has risen again. Lu Ming’s ranking has risen again. He’s so fast!</p><p>The other party was overjoyed. He cupped his fists and turned to leave, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming did not kill the other party. The other party’s strength was average and he would not have many points. Even if he killed him, he would not gain many points.</p><p>I don’t know where these top experts are. It seems like I can only try my luck!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, he randomly chose a direction and left.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to a wide street alone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a group of people surrounded Lu Ming in a flash.</p><p>There were more than twenty of them.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s you, kid. What a coincidence, what a coincidence. Now, let’s see how you die.”</p><p>One of them burst out laughing the moment he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>It was actually the Tigermen!</p><p>Moreover, the person who laughed just now was actually Hu Mao, the one who had declared that he would let all the Tiger clan kill Lu Ming.</p><p>kid, it seems like the heavens want you to touch me. Now, kneel down and lick my shoes, and I’ll consider letting you die a quick death!</p><p>Hu Mao extended a leg and said coldly.</p><p>The other Tigermen glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>it seems that you have quite a lot of points on you. Then, your points are mine!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the Tiger’s fur and spoke indifferently.</p><p>What?</p><p>What?</p><p>Hu Mao and the others were stunned, thinking that they had heard wrong.</p><p>What did Lu Ming say? They wanted to steal their points? Is he crazy?</p><p>A mere piece of trash from the chaotic astral River actually wants to take their points. If he’s not crazy, what is he?</p><p>it seems that this brat is not only stupid but also blindly arrogant. How sad. Since that’s the case, I’ll let him die miserably and let him know the consequences of offending my Tiger-Man race!</p><p>Hu Mao said sinisterly.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>One of the Tiger clan’s young men made a move. He waved his large hand and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was merely at the transformation void martial stage. Moreover, he came from a small place like the chaotic astral River. What kind of combat strength could he have? he could easily suppress Lu Ming with a flip of his hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
