It’s my big brother!”</p><p>Seeing this young man, situ Xiao cried out in ecstasy.</p><p>This young man was situ Feng.</p><p>All the people around the square looked at situ Feng with all kinds of emotions.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The master of Yunfeng Pavilion looked at situ Feng with satisfaction.</p><p>As the most powerful force in the chaotic astral River, the Yunfeng Pavilion has the right to recommend geniuses to take part in the Qin heaven thirteen clans “disciple recruitment test.</p><p>Furthermore, she would also reward anyone who was chosen by the thirteen clans.</p><p>Therefore, the more geniuses there are in the chaotic astral River, the happier she is.</p><p>With situ Feng’s talent, there was a high chance that he would be chosen by the Qin heaven thirteen clans. He might even be chosen by the three overlords.</p><p>Becoming a disciple of one of the three Overlord forces was undoubtedly a difficult task. However, once one joined, their future would be boundless.</p><p>The eyes of the cloud Peak Pavilion master were burning with pa.s.sion.</p><p>hahaha, it’s Feng ‘er! It’s my son, situ Feng! It’s my son …</p><p>At this moment, situ haonan finally reacted and laughed out loud in surprise.</p><p>“Brother situ, congratulations!”</p><p>On Kang Ji’s face, he managed to squeeze out a smile and congratulated situ haonan.</p><p>In his heart, he was extremely jealous.</p><p>With situ Feng’s talent, if he joined the thirteen clans and even caught the eye of some important figure, then the Footloose sect’s status would rise like a boat with the tide.</p><p>He was jealous in his heart, but on the surface, he still wanted to build a good relationship with situ haonan.</p><p>brother situ, so that heaven’s favorite is your son. Your son’s talent is truly shocking!</p><p>“Not bad, not bad. Brother situ, I’ll treat you to a drink some other day. You must do me the honor!”</p><p>“Brother situ …”</p><p>Immediately, the leaders of the major forces around situ haonan greeted him with a smile.</p><p>It was obvious that he was trying to curry favor with situ haonan.</p><p>What a joke! Situ Feng’s talent was too shocking, and there was a high chance that he would be taken in as a disciple by the thirteen clans. If he didn’t suck up to situ haonan now, when else could he wait?</p><p>hahaha, everyone. you’re too polite, too polite. Right now.. might not be chosen by the Qin heaven thirteen clans. It’s not certain yet …</p><p>Situ haonan laughed out loud.</p><p>Although he said that situ Feng might not be chosen by the thirteen clans, his expression was extremely excited, as if he could already see situ Feng being chosen by the thirteen clans or even taken as a disciple by some Big Shot.</p><p>His heart was at ease!</p><p>this situ Feng actually has such amazing talent …</p><p>In the crowd, the ancestor of technique was also shocked.</p><p>He had heard of situ Feng’s name before. It was rumored that situ Feng was a martial arts fanatic who was obsessed with cultivation. He didn’t expect situ Feng to be so talented.</p><p>However, at the thought of Lu Ming, he was relieved.</p><p>No matter how talented he was, he could not be compared to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the path of domination. Once he became a G.o.d, he would turn into the divine energy of domination. That was divine-grade divine energy.</p><p>Even in the vast Qin heaven Star Domain, there were probably not many who could control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>This batch of people, in general, was about the same as the first batch. About 90% of them were eliminated, and only about 1000 people pa.s.sed the trial.</p><p>Two from the yuanluo Palace and three from the Walkabout sect had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm and he was unmoved.</p><p>the second batch is over. The third batch, go in!</p><p>The pavilion master of the cloud Peak Pavilion ordered again.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing and the rest.</p><p>“Alright!” Xie nianqing and the others nodded, then rose into the air and flew into the giant tower.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming flew into the giant tower, the surrounding environment changed immediately. He appeared in a vast secret room. There was no one else around him except him.</p><p>This was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>This giant tower was obviously set up with a large formation. As long as one entered, they would most likely be alone and not with others.</p><p>A token appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the secret room began to light up, and several figures appeared.</p><p>These figures were all puppets condensed by the formation and they charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and swept it across, shattering the puppets one by one.</p><p>The first level, pa.s.sed!</p><p>There was a staircase in the secret room. Lu Ming climbed up the stairs and arrived at the second floor.</p><p>Sure enough, another puppet was formed. It was stronger than the first level but it was not difficult for Lu Ming.</p><p>With a sweep of his spear, the puppet crumbled and Lu Ming ascended to the third level.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming advanced all the way with an irresistible force.</p><p>Third level, fourth level, fifth level …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming reached the thirtieth level.</p><p>At this point, the puppet’s strength was already quite strong. However, to Lu Ming, it was still not difficult. At most, his speed would be slightly reduced.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear trembled and rays of spear radiance shot out. The puppets exploded one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the thirty-first level.</p><p>Then, it was the thirty-second and thirty-third levels.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming reached the thirty-sixth level. After he had defeated all the puppets on the thirty-sixth level, the token above his head began to glow.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming had pa.s.sed the test.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not continue. Instead, he walked toward a door of light at the side.</p><p>Lu Ming did not plan to continue.</p><p>It was enough. As long as he pa.s.sed the test, there was no need to attract too much attention.</p><p>His goal was to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Right now, it was just a screening. It would be fine as long as he could pa.s.s.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the light door and was teleported out of the light door. He was outside the giant tower.</p><p>After Lu Ming came out, a few gazes immediately swept toward him.</p><p>That included Kang long, situ Xiao, Kang Ji, and the others.</p><p>Hmph, he was transported out so early, and the brightness of the token is not even as bright as mine. He probably just pa.s.sed through level 36!</p><p>Kang long sneered.</p><p>that’s right. I thought he had a lot of talent, but he’s just so-so!</p><p>Situ Xiao also sneered.</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan were also discussing.</p><p>I didn’t expect this kid from the righteous Army to succeed in clearing the trial. However, the brightness of the token is ordinary. There’s almost no hope of him joining the Qin heaven thirteen clans!</p><p>Kang Ji sneered and deliberately raised his voice for the ancestor of technique to hear.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. He could not be bothered.</p><p>He was very clear about Lu Ming’s talent. If he had given it his all, he would not have come out so early. It was obvious that Lu Ming did not want to be too ostentatious. It was fine as long as he could pa.s.s the test.</p><p>Lu Ming did not attract any attention.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming came out, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and dandan came out one after another.</p><p>Naturally, they had successfully cleared the level. However, the brightness of the token was similar to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Obviously, their thoughts were similar to Lu Ming’s. It was enough to just pa.s.s the test.</p><p>After some time, Tong Xi ‘er also appeared.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er had also pa.s.sed. The brightness of her token was much brighter than Lu Ming and the rest. She had pa.s.sed more than forty levels.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
