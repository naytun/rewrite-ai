His eyes scanned the nine young men and women and finally stopped on a young man with a cold expression.</p><p>This young man was also his son, situ Xiao’s elder brother, situ Feng!</p><p>Looking at situ Feng, situ haonan’s eyes shone with hope.</p><p>Situ Feng was obsessed with cultivation and had no interest in anything else.</p><p>However, he knew very well that situ Feng’s comprehension ability was extremely shocking. With his shocking comprehension ability, there was a high chance that he would be chosen by the Qin heaven thirteen clans and taken in as a disciple.</p><p>This was his only hope!</p><p>Once situ Feng joined the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, he would be able to destroy the righteous heavenly Army with a flip of his hand.</p><p>Ten days pa.s.sed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The geniuses of the various forces began to gather in Yunfeng city.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and dandan also met up with the ancestor of technique, Tong Xi ‘er, and the others.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that after bubbles, Lu Ming’s disciples, Lu Xiangxiang, and Ouyang Moli found out about this matter, they also clamored to go and take a look. They said that they wanted to see Lu Ming’s elegance, so Lu Ming brought them along.</p><p>After stepping into the teleportation array, they arrived at Yunfeng city a few days later.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s second visit to Yunfeng city. Yunfeng city was as lively as usual.</p><p>On the streets, people came and went, and the shops formed a forest.</p><p>When they arrived at Yunfeng city, the Dharma ancestor brought them to the registration office of Yunfeng Pavilion and registered.</p><p>It wasn’t that easy to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven 13 clans ‘final disciple recruitment meet. They had to first go through the selection process of Yunfeng city.</p><p>Only those who were selected by Yunfeng city would be recommended to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven 13 clans ‘disciple recruitment meet.</p><p>Therefore, a large number of people would be filtered out from the beginning.</p><p>after seven days, those who are partic.i.p.ating in the selection, gather at the Yun peak square!</p><p>The person in charge of registration said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>After registering, they found an Inn to stay in and waited.</p><p>In a flash, seven days had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group headed towards the cloud Peak square.</p><p>The cloud Peak square was extremely vast, and it could easily accommodate a million people.</p><p>At this moment, a dense crowd had already gathered around the Yunfeng square.</p><p>There were all kinds of races. Lu Ming scanned the area and discovered dozens of races.</p><p>Of course, most of them were only here to watch and were not qualified to partic.i.p.ate in the screening.</p><p>those who are partic.i.p.ating in the selection, enter the square. Those who are not qualified to partic.i.p.ate in the selection, leave the square!</p><p>In the sky above the square, there was a middle-aged man in battle armor. His skin was golden, and he looked like a bronze man.</p><p>This was the bronze skin race. In the Qin heaven Starfield, they were considered a small race.</p><p>However, the man’s aura was so terrifying that many people couldn’t breathe.</p><p>“He is much stronger than the yuanluo Palace Master and the ancestor of technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This burly man’s cultivation was definitely above stage six true G.o.d. It was even possible that he was a terrifying existence above stage seven true G.o.d.</p><p>Many people couldn’t help but retreat out of the square.</p><p>Only a few young people who were partic.i.p.ating in the selection walked into the square.</p><p>“You guys go, just do your best!”</p><p>The ancestor of technique warned.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded and stepped into the square.</p><p>As he stepped into the square, Lu Ming immediately noticed that there were a few eyes looking at him.</p><p>“Kang long, situ Xiao …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and he found Kang long and situ Xiao.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were looking at Lu Ming with sinister expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and ignored the two of them.</p><p>As time pa.s.sed, more and more people gathered in the square.</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, there were close to 1000 forces like the righteous heaven Army and the origin Luo Palace, or perhaps even stronger.</p><p>The smaller ones had five to six people, seven to eight people partic.i.p.ating.</p><p>Some of the bigger forces had dozens of people.</p><p>For example, the Yunfeng Pavilion had sent over two hundred people to partic.i.p.ate.</p><p>All the forces had sent over 50000 people.</p><p>“The pavilion master of the Yunfeng Pavilion has arrived!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The master of the Yunfeng Pavilion is about to descend. He is currently the strongest person in the chaotic astral River, and also the only heavenly deity.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>In the distance, beams of light flew over and stood in the sky above the square.</p><p>There were five people in total, and four of them gave off terrifying auras. Their auras were many times stronger than the burly man from the bronze skin clan.</p><p>However, these four people were all following behind a beautiful middle-aged woman.</p><p>This beautiful middle-aged woman was a human. She did not seem to have any aura.</p><p>“This subordinate greets the pavilion master!”</p><p>However, the burly man from the bronze-skinned race and the other experts from the Yunfeng Pavilion all saluted the middle-aged beauty with great respect!</p><p>the pavilion master of the Yunfeng Pavilion is actually a woman …</p><p>At this moment, many people’s hearts were moved and they looked surprised.</p><p>“For countless years, this is the first time the Qin heavenly thirteen clans have opened their doors to the chaotic astral River to recruit disciples. This is a Supreme opportunity for all of you. Everyone, you must grasp it well!”</p><p>The clear voice of the Yunfeng Pavilion master resounded in everyone’s ears.</p><p>however, all of you have to be mentally prepared. The Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘standards for recruiting disciples are astonishingly high. Without a certain level of talent, it’s impossible to be chosen. Therefore, we’re going to conduct a selection today. Those who pa.s.s the selection, I’ll recommend you to partic.i.p.ate in the subsequent tests of the Qin Tian thirteen clans!</p><p>At this point, the Yunfeng Pavilion master waved his hand, and a small tower flew out.</p><p>The small PaG.o.da was bronze in color. As soon as it flew out, it rapidly grew in size. In the end, it turned into a giant PaG.o.da that floated in the air. It had a total of 81 floors.</p><p>the selection process is very simple. You will have to challenge the tower. There are puppets on every level of the tower. You will pa.s.s as long as you can pa.s.s the 36th level!</p><p>when you enter the tower, a token will be condensed and follow you. Once you pa.s.s through the thirty-sixth level, the token will light up. No one can cheat. Ten thousand people in a group. Go in!</p><p>The cloud Peak Pavilion master announced.</p><p>“It’s just a Tower Challenge. This is easy. I’ll go first!”</p><p>A burly young man was the first to soar into the sky and fly toward the gate of the giant tower.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“I’ll join you too!”</p><p>Immediately, figures rose into the air and flew toward the giant tower.</p><p>When 10,000 people entered the giant tower, the gate of the giant tower automatically closed.</p><p>Everyone waited patiently.</p><p>When everyone flew into the giant tower, they could see that the first floor of the giant tower was shining.</p><p>However, in just a few breaths, the second floor of the giant tower also glowed.</p><p>This meant that someone had already reached the second level of the tower.</p><p>But very quickly, the third, fourth, and fifth levels lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest did not enter. They would take a look first.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
