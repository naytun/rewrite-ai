Both of them stared at Lu Ming with an unfriendly expression.</p><p>“It’s you again, looking for abuse!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast an indifferent glance at Huang Wu.</p><p>“Kid, you’re good. This time, I’ll cripple you. You guys go and break his limbs. I’ll make him cry on the ground!”</p><p>Huang Wu said in a ruthless manner.</p><p>It was not that he did not want to kill Lu Ming, but there was a rule in the Kong Xuan sect that disciples of the same sect were not allowed to kill each other.</p><p>However, fighting was not forbidden. As long as they did not kill or cripple their cultivation, they could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Otherwise, Huang Wu would have crushed Lu Ming’s bones and scattered his ashes.</p><p>Junior Brother Huang Wu, don’t worry. I’ll break his limbs and make him cry on the ground like a cripple!</p><p>The short and fat young man said ferociously. Divine power burst out from him, and he pressed down on Lu Ming like a mountain.</p><p>At the same time, the tall and thin young man also burst out with divine power and stepped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Sixth level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>The short and fat youth and the tall and thin youth were both at the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm. The divine power they controlled was undoubtedly King-grade divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he was probably not a match for a sixth level void G.o.d Realm expert who had King-grade divine power.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>The short and fat youth and the tall and thin youth shouted and attacked at the same time. Their weapons were a giant hammer. When they waved it, the power was amazing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The wind whistled and the terrifying force crushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and retreated rapidly.</p><p>“You want to leave? stay!”</p><p>The Liu brothers bellowed and chased after him relentlessly. Their huge hammers were like a storm, blasting towards Lu Ming.</p><p>This was also an incomplete divine skill. When the two of them worked together, their power would double.</p><p>“Who said I’m leaving?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly stopped. He waved his hand and shouted,”Smash!”</p><p>A bangle flew out of Lu Ming’s hand and turned into a huge ball, which was thrown at the short and fat young man.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The short and fat youth roared as he continued to smash the hammer on the round ball.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a huge explosion. Then, the short and fat young man’s eyes popped out. With a scream, his body flew out like a kite with a broken string. He crashed heavily on the ground and could not get up for a long time.</p><p>That round ball was naturally QiuQiu.</p><p>During these days, QiuQiu had devoured a large number of divine artifact fragments and metal-attribute blacksmithing materials, and it had advanced once again.</p><p>Now, QiuQiu had already reached fifth-level void G.o.d-level!</p><p>With QiuQiu’s strength, it would not be a problem for it to defeat the short and chubby youth who was at the sixth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Unless the other party had reached the seventh level of the void G.o.d Realm and controlled King-grade divine power, he would not be able to resist QiuQiu.</p><p>After sending the chunky young man flying, QiuQiu smacked toward the tall and thin young man.</p><p>In the end, he was no different from the short and fat young man. He was sent flying by QiuQiu and fell to the ground, vomiting blood.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Huang Wu’s eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.</p><p>“That is a metallic lifeform?”</p><p>The commotion here had long since alarmed some of the outer sect disciples in the nearby courtyards, and the scene of QiuQiu smashing the Liu brothers flying was naturally seen by them.</p><p>Those people were shocked.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to have such a powerful metallic lifeform.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold eyes swept across Huang Wu.</p><p>Huang Wu was almost scared to death. He turned around and ran.</p><p>However, how could his speed be faster than QiuQiu? QiuQiu directly flew over and smashed down on Huang Wu’s head. Huang Wu tried his best to block, but he was also sent flying. He fell to the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>just now, you said you wanted to break my limbs. Now, I’ll try it on you!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and his divine power condensed into a long spear.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t you dare! Do you know who my big brother is? My big brother is Huang Wen, a heaven’s favorite among the inner disciples. If you dare to hurt me, my big brother will not let you off!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“You talk too much!”</p><p>I’ll go! Lu Ming said coldly. He pulled out the long spear and hit Huang Wu’s legs.</p><p>arghh! Huang Wu screamed. His legs were broken, and his broken bones were visible as blood gushed out.</p><p>Although he could recover from such injuries very quickly, the pain was real and would not be reduced at all.</p><p>“Ah ah ah, brat, you’re dead. I’m going to turn you into ashes …”</p><p>Huang Wu roared.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his spear again, breaking the bones in Huang Wu’s arms. Huang Wu lay on the ground like a pool of mud.</p><p>“Such great courage …”</p><p>The surrounding outer disciples all took in a cold breath.</p><p>&Nbsp; he knew Huang Wu’s ident.i.ty and still dared to be so ruthless. He was truly a ruthless person.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming kicked Huang Wu and sent him flying. He turned into a black dot in the sky.</p><p>If it was not for the Kong Xuan sect’s rule that killing was not allowed, Lu Ming would have killed Huang Wu without any hesitation.</p><p>ruthless, he’s really ruthless. He’ll definitely take revenge on Huang Wu!</p><p>that’s for sure. When the time comes, we’ll invite his big brother. If we invite any random outer sect expert, Lu Ming will be in danger!</p><p>“You’re too impulsive, not wise!”</p><p>The other outer sect disciples were discussing in secret.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was somewhat unfocused. He was about to return to his room to continue cultivating and strive for a breakthrough as soon as possible.</p><p>At this time, a beam of light flew over from the distant sky. A middle-aged man appeared in the sky.</p><p>“All disciples who have entered the sect for less than three thousand years, immediately gather at the square at the foot of the mountain!”</p><p>The man’s voice boomed out, filling the entire area.</p><p>After saying that, the middle-aged man repeated himself twice before turning around and leaving.</p><p>“Those who entered the sect within three thousand years?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised and did not understand why.</p><p>looks like we’ll have to go to that place. I’m so envious!</p><p>that’s right. If I can go there again, I’m afraid I can make a breakthrough in my cultivation!</p><p>Some of the older outer sect disciples started to discuss among themselves, and many of them looked envious.</p><p>Those who had just joined like Lu Ming were very surprised but did not ask much. They all flew down the mountain.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a huge square. They would meet there.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun the moment he arrived.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were both women.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled when he saw Lu Ming and flew over.</p><p>Many people cast their gazes at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>it’s a pity that she’s already taken. Who’s that kid? he actually has such good fortune!</p><p>“I’m so envious!”</p><p>Many male disciples cast envious, jealous, and hateful gazes at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were even more people who flew towards the female disciples and greeted them, taking the opportunity to close the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
