In a few days, the dark Dragon secret realm will open. As long as we enter the dark Dragon secret realm and obtain some treasures, we will be able to exchange them for a large number of points!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Dark Dragon secret realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious. This was the first time he had heard of it.</p><p>that’s right. The dark Dragon secret realm only opens once every one hundred thousand years. Moreover, only those below the true G.o.d Realm can enter. Therefore, this is a heaven for the outer disciples. At that time, all the powerful outer disciples will enter!</p><p>there are two main types of treasures in the dark Dragon secret realm. One is the dark Dragon beast, and the other is the Dragonbone flower. As long as you get the heart of the dark Dragon beast or the Dragon Bone of the Dragonbone flower, you can exchange it for a large number of points. In the past, a heart of a beast or a Dragon Bone of the Dragonbone flower could be exchanged for 100 points!</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>100 points!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>100 points were equivalent to 1 million divine gems. This price was extremely shocking.</p><p>If he could get 100 beast cores or 100 dragon bones from the Dragon Bone flower, he would have 10000 points.</p><p>If it was five hundred …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. If that was the case, he would have enough points to exchange for the first stage of the divine grade technique.</p><p>yeah, the reward is so amazing that even many inner disciples are jealous, but they can’t get in. Let me tell you, on the outer virtual G.o.d ranking list, there are actually many people who could have reached the true G.o.d Realm a long time ago, but they have been suppressing their cultivation, waiting for the dark Dragon secret land that only happens once every 100000 years. This is a good opportunity to make a lot of money!</p><p>“How is it? It will open in three days, do you want to go together?”</p><p>Yue Linglong said.</p><p>“Yes, of course I’m going!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He would be a fool not to go.</p><p>“Then let’s wait for a few days. We’ll go in a few days!”</p><p>Yue Linglong said. Then, the two of them went to the divine pulse tower and cultivated for a few days.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming and Yue Linglong flew out of the inner sect area and headed toward the outer sect area.</p><p>The entrance to the dark Dragon secret realm was located in a huge Palace in the outer gate area.</p><p>This Palace was usually closed. It would only open when the dark Dragon secret realm was about to open.</p><p>In the past few days, Lu Ming had gained a more detailed understanding of the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>The primeval universe was vast and boundless. It was the greater world and the most perfect and stable world.</p><p>Around it, there would be some small chiliocosm, such as the heaven realm and the primordial realm. At the same time, there would also be some Mystic realms.</p><p>These secret lands were of a higher level than many small chiliocosm, and they were closely attached to the primal universe.</p><p>The beings of the small chiliocosm could only reach the demiG.o.d realm. If they wanted to continue, they had to enter the primal universe.</p><p>However, some secret realms could give birth to G.o.ds or even stronger existences.</p><p>The dark Dragon secret realm was one such secret realm.</p><p>When Lu Ming and Yue Linglong arrived, they discovered that there was already a sea of people outside the palace.</p><p>Countless outer sect disciples had gathered.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Many people recognized Lu Ming the moment he arrived.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had made a name for himself by defeating three geniuses on the virtual G.o.d ranking list in a row. His reputation had long spread in the outer sect.</p><p>Hmph, this brat also wants to enter the dark Dragon secret realm. That’s good. I’ll get rid of him in there!</p><p>Some people snorted coldly in their hearts, their eyes like cold lightning.</p><p>Moreover, there were many people who had such thoughts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, several white-haired elders flew over from the distance and descended before the palace.</p><p>“The inner sect elder is here, the door is about to open!”</p><p>Many people were excited.</p><p>Many of them could break through to the true G.o.d Realm, but they had to stay at the peak of ethereal G.o.d Realm. They were waiting for the dark Dragon secret land to open so that they could get some benefits.</p><p>A total of three inner sect elders landed in front of the palace gate. Then, they waved their palms with divine power and three rays of divine power struck the palace gate.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The palace’s door glowed and rumbled as it slowly opened.</p><p>However, there was still a layer of light barrier on the door.</p><p>in the dark Dragon secret realm, the dark Dragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower are both very powerful. Those with weak cultivation and insufficient combat strength will not only fail to obtain the beast core and Dragon Bone, but will also die. Therefore, only those who can break through this light screen can enter the dark Dragon secret realm. Now, you can all go!</p><p>“Remember, you only have three months. After three months, you must return to this place. Otherwise, you will be locked up inside!”</p><p>An inner court elder announced.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Immediately, a group of outer sect disciples rushed to the gate.</p><p>The gate was a hundred meters tall and dozens of meters wide. It could easily accommodate hundreds of people.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The group of outer sect disciples each launched a powerful attack, bombarding the light shield of the gate, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>However, most of the people were blocked. Only a few people managed to break through the light shield and enter it. They disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, I don’t believe it. Break!”</p><p>Someone roared and used his strongest combat power, but he still couldn’t break the light shield.</p><p>you’re a piece of trash. Don’t block the way!</p><p>Behind them, other people rushed over and shouted loudly. Their divine power rolled out, wanting to blast away the people in front.</p><p>“You’re the useless one!”</p><p>The person in front was furious and brazenly attacked. However, after exchanging a blow with the person behind him, he spat out a large mouthful of blood and crashed into the light barrier. His face turned pale.</p><p>“Dongfang Hao …”</p><p>The man’s face was pale. The one who had attacked him was Dongfang Hao.</p><p>“Trash, get lost!”</p><p>shut up! Dongfang Hao snorted coldly. He struck out a palm, which pierced through the light screen and entered the hall.</p><p>those who can’t break the light shield, get out of the way! Don’t block the way!</p><p>An inner elder’s voice rang out. With a wave of his hand, waves of energy rolled out and sent those who could not break the light shield flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>There were people constantly moving forward, breaking the light shield and entering the hall.</p><p>“Anyone with the combat strength of a ninth level void G.o.d Realm can break it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already seen through the trick.</p><p>As long as one had the combat strength of a ninth-level void G.o.d Realm martial artist, they would be able to break the light shield.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go in quickly!”</p><p>Yue Linglong cried out and flew forward. Lu Ming followed suit and came to the front of the light shield of the door.</p><p>Yue Linglong waved her palm, and the light shield collapsed like a wave. With a flash, she entered the light shield.</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch, penetrating the light shield and entering it.</p><p>Behind the door was a huge, empty Hall. In the middle of the hall was a huge black Vortex. This was the entrance to the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>The two of them dashed into the vortex in a flash. The world spun around them. The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had appeared on a piece of yellow land with Yue Linglong by his side.</p><p>let’s go and hunt for the netherdragon beast and the Dragon Bone flower. Three months will pa.s.s in the blink of an eye!</p><p>Yue Linglong said. The two of them turned into a rainbow light and flew into the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
