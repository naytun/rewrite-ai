Lu Ming did not know how big it was, but he felt that it was at least much bigger than the heaven realm, the primordial realm, and the evil G.o.d Realm combined.</p><p>The two of them flew for a few hours, but they did not encounter anything. What they saw was a vast expanse of Yellow Earth.</p><p>the two of us are too unlucky. When we entered, we were actually teleported to this yellow land. This yellow land is completely barren, and there are no netherdragon beasts or Dragon Bone flowers!</p><p>Yue Linglong said with a bitter face.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little depressed but he had no choice but to hurry along with his bad luck.</p><p>After flying for another two hours, mountain peaks gradually appeared in front of them.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Roars could be heard from the mountains.</p><p>“It’s the netherdragon!”</p><p>Yue Linglong’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The two of them increased their speed and flew toward the mountain peak.</p><p>However, at this moment, streaks of light also appeared from other directions, flying towards the same mountain peaks. They were the other outer sect disciples.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and discovered more than ten people.</p><p>“Let’s increase our speed!”</p><p>Yue Linglong shouted as she circulated her divine power. It was as if she was covered in a layer of seven-colored light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a few powerful auras came from the sky. The pressure was like a tide, pressing in all directions, shrouding Lu Ming and some other outer sect disciples. It was extremely overbearing.</p><p>Then, two young people, a man and a woman, descended and blocked in front of everyone.</p><p>the nether Dragon in this area belongs to the two of us. You guys can leave!</p><p>The man said coldly. He glanced at Lu Ming and the rest with an arrogant look.</p><p>Moreover, his tone was full of threat.</p><p>It was as if the others had to do as he said.</p><p>“It’s Lu Yang who’s ranked 35th and Fang ya who’s ranked 37th on the virtual G.o.d ranking!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed as he recognized the two of them.</p><p>“How can we be so unlucky to have met the two of them the moment we arrived?”</p><p>“It seems that we can only leave!”</p><p>The other outer sect disciples ‘faces were ugly, but they were also filled with helplessness.</p><p>Those who could enter the dark Dragon secret realm were all at the ninth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>However, he only had the combat strength of a ninth-level ethereal G.o.d Realm expert. Compared to the Supreme talents on the ethereal G.o.d Realm, he was still far from them.</p><p>Especially the top 50 on the virtual G.o.d ranking list. Each of them had amazing combat strength and could survive against a Lv 1 true G.o.d expert.</p><p>It was said that the top thirty heaven’s favorites could even fight against a first stage true G.o.d.</p><p>Although Lu Yang and Fang ya were only ranked 35th and 37th, they were a couple and were good at joint attacks. If they joined forces, they could fight against the top 30 heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>Normal ninth level void G.o.d Realm experts were far weaker than them.</p><p>The other outer sect disciples also slowly retreated, despite their unwillingness.</p><p>However, Lu Ming and Yue Linglong did not retreat at all.</p><p>“Why aren’t you guys leaving?”</p><p>Lu Yang looked at Lu Ming and Yue Linglong, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>retreat? why should we retreat? since we’ve encountered the netherdragon, we’ll have to rely on our own abilities to obtain the netherdragon’s beast core!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Kid, you’re very confident!”</p><p>Lu Yang’s gaze turned even colder. He said, ” the dark Dragon secret realm is no longer within the sect. Killing is not forbidden. Do you understand? ”</p><p>This was a blatant threat.</p><p>His meaning was obvious. If Lu Ming did not retreat, he would stay here forever.</p><p>you talk too much nonsense. Either get lost or attack!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and berated him directly. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party.</p><p>He did not have much time. A Dark Dragon Core or the Dragon Bone of the Dragonbone flower were both points and money. If Lu Ming wanted to exchange for the divine-grade technique, he would have to wait for a few months. He did not have time to waste with the other party.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Yang shouted coldly. He pointed his finger at Lu Ming like a sword. A beam of sword light burst out from his finger. It was incomparably sharp. It let out a terrifying howl and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. His divine energy was boiling and it hit Lu Yang’s finger.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Yang’s fingers were broken and twisted into a twisted shape. His face turned into the color of a pig’s liver. With a blood-curdling scream, he retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The other outer sect disciples who had already retreated opened their mouths wide in shock when they saw this scene.</p><p>After the clash, Lu Yang was actually the one who was defeated.</p><p>I recognize him! It’s Lu Ming! He’s Lu Ming!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Ming, the one who defeated Dongfang Hao, Huang Chengan, and the Scorpion Tiger in succession?”</p><p>“That’s right, it’s him!”</p><p>terrifying! It’s only been a few years, and he’s gotten stronger again!</p><p>The others exclaimed.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Yang’s expression was extremely ferocious as he stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>alright, I’d like to see what you’re capable of. Fang ya, let’s join forces!</p><p>Lu Yang called out.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>In a flash, Fang ya appeared beside Lu Yang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two sword hums resounded. Lu Yang and Fang ya unsheathed their swords. Two beams of sword light shot up into the sky. Then, the two beams of sword light intertwined and charged towards Lu Ming. The sword momentum was continuous, and the power was astonishing.</p><p>The two of them were much stronger than the Scorpion Tiger back then.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was not what it used to be.</p><p>In the past few years, he had cultivated three king-grade divine techniques and cultivated three divine flames. His divine power had increased by a large margin.</p><p>In addition, his cultivation had already broken through to the 5th level of the void G.o.d Realm, so he was much stronger than when he had fought Xie Hu and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took out his long spear and swept it out.</p><p>This spear attack didn’t use the three apocalyptic strikes. It only used an incomplete divine skill.</p><p>The spear radiance and the sword radiance collided with each other in an intense battle.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of the collision was like a thunderclap. After more than ten consecutive collisions, Lu Yang and Fang ya retreated a thousand meters before they stopped.</p><p>The two of them were pale and blood kept flowing out of the corners of their mouths. A hole had appeared on both of their bodies, and it was clear that they had been pierced by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>“This time, I’ll let you go. Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>Lu Yang’s and Fang ya’s expressions were ugly. However, there was deep shock in their eyes. They understood that they were not Lu Ming’s match at all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two of them turned into two streaks of light and left.</p><p>he’s so strong. Lu Ming is so strong. Lu Yang and Fang ya joined forces but they are not his match!</p><p>it’s only been five or six years, but his strength has improved greatly again. I’m afraid his current combat strength can rank in the top 30, no, even the top 20 of the virtual G.o.d-level!</p><p>The outer sect disciples who had witnessed the fight between Lu Ming and Fang ya from Lu Yang were all in shock.</p><p>“You want to stay here and compete with me?”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the outer sect disciples.</p><p>The outer sect disciples ‘expressions changed.</p><p>What a joke. Competing with Lu Ming? was he not courting death?</p><p>Immediately, they all flew away with their tails between their legs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
