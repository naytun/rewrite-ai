So what if you’re fast? you can’t break my defense!”</p><p>The Golden Sage laughed.</p><p>“Lu Ming really can’t break the defense of the Golden Sage!”</p><p>the difference in strength isn’t that great. Golden Sage is an undefeatable existence. His defensive power is too shocking!</p><p>Many people sighed, thinking that this round was going to be a draw again.</p><p>Golden Saint, your defensive power is indeed amazing, but how do you know that this is my strongest combat power? ”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The Golden Sage was stunned.</p><p>“Let’s see if you can block this spear of mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped back and suddenly rushed towards the Golden Sage. His long spear shook and turned into more than ten spear lights, stabbing towards the Golden Sage.</p><p>However, just as his spear radiance was about to hit the Golden Sage, more than a dozen spear radiances merged together and turned into a spear radiance that stabbed toward the Golden Sage.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>An ear-piercing sound rang out. It was as if a layer of leather had been pierced.</p><p>Then, he heard the Golden saint’s roar. His body flew far away and fell to the ground.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Everyone’s pupils contracted.</p><p>The defense of the Golden Sage had been broken!</p><p>There was a hole in the Golden Sage’s heart. It was pierced through from the front to the back by Lu Ming.</p><p>the sixth level. Your incomplete divine skill has already been cultivated to the sixth level!</p><p>The Golden Sage struggled to get up and shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“The sixth level!”</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled, and their faces were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had also cultivated the incomplete attack-type divine skill to the sixth level.</p><p>Both his speed-type and offensive-type divine skills had been cultivated to the sixth level, the same as Linghu ye.</p><p>This was heaven-defying!</p><p>This time, there were actually two such heaven-defying characters.</p><p>One had to know that the further one cultivated an incomplete divine skill, the more difficult it would be to cultivate, and the more powerful it would be.</p><p>For example, Golden Saint, yang Chong, and Hu ya were all existences who could control divine grade divine power. To be able to control divine grade divine power, one’s comprehension ability was definitely not bad. However, they had only cultivated it to the peak of the fourth heaven, which was far from the sixth heaven.</p><p>Many found it hard to believe, but they knew that it was the truth. Otherwise, it would not have been able to break through the defense of the Golden Sage.</p><p>Linghu ye could not break it because his divine power level was too low. However, Lu Ming’s divine power level was not low.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>what terrifying comprehension. His future achievements will be limitless!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>our indestructible sword sect will definitely want this kind of person!</p><p>An expert from the indestructible sword sect suddenly spoke.</p><p>“You’re determined to not destroy the sword sect? Laughable. My unique devil Academy wants this kid!”</p><p>in my opinion, the boundless sacred Academy is more suitable for him!</p><p>At this moment, the cultivators of the three Overlord forces all spoke.</p><p>These experts were no small matter. They had seen something unusual.</p><p>They felt that Lu Ming had not used his full strength.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had used the soul transformation technique to conceal the characteristics and levels of the ruler’s divine power, such an expert had sharp eyes. They could vaguely sense that Lu Ming’s divine power was unfathomable and high above.</p><p>Therefore, they spoke up one after another.</p><p>Many people were at a loss for words, and some young men were extremely envious.</p><p>The a.s.sessment had not even ended yet, and the three Overlord forces had already started s.n.a.t.c.hing people.</p><p>Other people could not join the three Overlord forces even if they wanted to. However, Lu Ming had become a popular person. He could choose from the three Overlord forces. This kind of treatment was really different. It was no wonder that he was envious.</p><p>“Freak, freak! I never thought that there would be such a freak in my chaotic astral River!”</p><p>“Brother fa, congratulations!”</p><p>“Brother fa, please forgive me if I’ve been inconsiderate in the past!”</p><p>In the chaotic astral River, some of the leaders of the forces had already begun to fawn over fa Ming. In particular, some of the leaders of the forces who had a grudge against the ancestor of technique were even smiling obsequiously and flattering him.</p><p>What a joke. It was a sure thing that Lu Ming would join the three Overlord forces. He would also be valued. The influence of the righteous Army would definitely rise.</p><p>As for Kang Ji and situ haonan, both of their eyes revealed a look of fear. Many thoughts turned in their hearts and they already started to think about what to do next!</p><p>“Do you still want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to King Kong.</p><p>I’m not fighting anymore. Since you’ve broken through my defense, I admit defeat!</p><p>Jin Gang shook his head and returned to the stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming had won this battle.</p><p>Now, there was still the final battle, which was Lu Ming against Linghu ye.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you need to rest?”</p><p>The middle-aged man asked.</p><p>“I don’t need to!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded and looked at Linghu ye. “Linghu ye, do you still want to fight?”</p><p>The reason why he asked this was that, judging from the strength on the surface, Linghu ye was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>The incomplete divine skills that the two of them had comprehended were similar, but Lu Ming’s cultivation level was slightly weaker. He was at the demiG.o.d level. However, Lu Ming’s divine power level was much higher than Linghu ye’s. His overall ability was still higher than Linghu ye’s.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Linghu ye’s answer was simple, and he jumped into the fighting ring.</p><p>“Linghu ye actually accepted the challenge. I’m afraid he can’t match Lu Ming!”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>He couldn’t use divine artifacts in the dream s.p.a.ce, and he couldn’t use some secret techniques either. In a situation where he was weaker on the surface, he could only rely on his battle techniques and consciousness.</p><p>If Linghu ye wanted to win, he had to be far superior to Lu Ming in terms of combat awareness and combat skills.</p><p>However, that was obviously impossible.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, and an intense battle began.</p><p>Linghu ye’s combat skills and combat awareness were very strong. They were astonishingly strong. However, Lu Ming was not inferior at all. He was even stronger than Linghu ye.</p><p>There was no suspense in this battle.</p><p>After more than ten moves, Linghu ye was. .h.i.t by Lu Ming and retreated while vomiting blood.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I lost today because my divine power level is not high enough. If my divine power level was high enough, I would not have lost!”</p><p>Linghu ye’s face was dark.</p><p>This time, he had thought that he could sweep away all the heroes and take the first place. He did not expect to be defeated by Lu Ming. He was a little unwilling.</p><p>Even though this was only a test, he would not allow himself to lose.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not say anything.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about we fight again a thousand years later?”</p><p>Linghu ye continued to issue a challenge.</p><p>“I’ll accompany you anytime!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, after a thousand years, we’ll fight and I’ll definitely defeat you!</p><p>Linghu ye was full of confidence.</p><p>As long as he obtained the divine skill, the level of his divine power would continue to rise. He might even cultivate to the peak and condense divine-grade divine power.</p><p>alright, the a.s.sessment is over!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced in the air.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. The main event was about to begin.</p><p>The examination had ended. Now, it was time to join the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Many of the youths couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
