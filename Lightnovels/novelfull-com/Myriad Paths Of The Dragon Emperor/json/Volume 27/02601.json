This was a divine-grade divine power. Even in the vast primal universe, it was a very rare divine power. The chaotic astral River had never appeared before.</p><p>Now, someone could actually control the power of a ruler.</p><p>no wonder he’s so terrifying. He could defeat an empty G.o.d when he’s only at the transformation void martial stage. It’s too shocking!</p><p>it’s the power of a ruler! Which force is this monster from? ”</p><p>it’s a pity that his cultivation is too low. Otherwise, he would be terrifying!</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“I’ve still been recognized!”</p><p>Lu Ming himself was somewhat speechless.</p><p>When he made his move just now, he had already done some tricks and concealed his power, but people still recognized his power of domination.</p><p>The main thing was that once the ruler’s power was used, its characteristics were too obvious, and it would be easy to be recognized.</p><p>it seems that I still have to find a way to hide the characteristics of the power of domination. Otherwise, I’ll be recognized as soon as I make a move in the future. It’ll be too eye-catching!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>It was not a good thing to attract too much attention before one was too strong. Sometimes, it would even attract a fatal disaster.</p><p>“Senior, I won!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the silver-haired old man.</p><p>“Little brother is truly a peerless genius. If there’s a chance, this old man will treat you to a drink!”</p><p>The silver-haired elder smiled and took out two storage rings, pa.s.sing them to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and put it away. He smiled. I still have something to do. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll definitely treat you to a drink!</p><p>After exchanging some pleasantries, Lu Ming and Tong Xi ‘er left the place together.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll definitely get my revenge!”</p><p>Below the fighting ring, situ Xiao struggled to get up. He looked in the direction where Lu Ming had left, his face ashen and full of resentment.</p><p>Lu Ming and Tong Xi ‘er did not stop. They arrived at the teleportation array in Yunfeng city and headed towards true sky Star.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming returned to the true heavenstar.</p><p>This time, he won 20000 divine crystals from situ Xiao. Lu Ming was in a great mood. This trip to Yunfeng city had not been in vain.</p><p>Lu Ming now had thirty-eight thousand divine crystals, a few thousand more than before.</p><p>Back at his residence, Lu Ming took out a pile of divine artifact fragments and gave them to QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>QiuQiu was instantly extremely excited. It hugged a large pile of divine artifact fragments and ate them happily.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming looked in one direction. There was a powerful aura coming from that direction. A giant turtle appeared in the void, and countless runes filled the air.</p><p>“Dan dan …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He took a step forward and appeared above a mansion in the city.</p><p>This mansion used to be dandan’s residence.</p><p>Dandan was trying to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm. It had been in seclusion all these years since it came to the desolate universe, and it had finally begun to try to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>A figure flashed and bubbles appeared beside Lu Ming. She grabbed Lu Ming’s hand and shook it vigorously.</p><p>It had been a while since they last met, and bubbles ‘cultivation base had improved significantly. She was now a peak heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Needless to say, bubbles ‘talent was definitely top-notch. Moreover, the cultivation environment in the primeval universe was too good. In addition, Lu Ming had given her some resources. It was normal for her cultivation to improve by leaps and bounds.</p><p>However, even after so many years, bubbles still looked like she was six or seven years old. Her growth rate was shockingly slow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Many figures appeared nearby, all attracted by dandan’s breakthrough.</p><p>“That old turtle actually broke through faster than us!”</p><p>The t.i.tan longhorn beetle sighed.</p><p>Qing Cang, the nine lives devilish silkworm, and the others sighed.</p><p>They had broken through to the demiG.o.d realm at about the same time as dandan, but now, they were still some distance away from the martial G.o.d Realm. On the other hand, dandan had already broken through.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura in dandan’s mansion became stronger. A huge turtle figure was suspended in the air. Endless energy between heaven and earth gathered towards dandan.</p><p>“This guy’s breakthrough really caused a huge commotion!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Although it wasn’t as loud as Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s breakthrough, it was much more intense than the others.</p><p>the divine turtle of the world came from the primeval universe. It’s indeed extraordinary!</p><p>At this time, the ancestral Dragon also appeared not far away.</p><p>“The divine turtle of the world came from the primal universe?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>The t.i.tan longhorn beetle, nine lives devilish silkworm, Qing Cang, and the others also looked at the ancestral Dragon curiously. They didn’t know this.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Zu long nodded. back then, the top ten war beasts of the heaven realm were mostly mutations of various divine beast races. They had unique talents, but there were also a few that came from the primal universe. The World Turtle was one of them!</p><p>“The other one is this little guy!”</p><p>The ancestral Dragon looked at bubbles.</p><p>bubbles, are you also from the desolate universe? ”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>other than these two, the Saint spirit ants also come from the primeval universe. Unfortunately, they died in the ancient war!</p><p>The ancestral Dragon sighed.</p><p>At this moment, dandan’s aura was even more shocking. Like a black hole, she was madly absorbing the divine Qi outside.</p><p>“You don’t have enough divine Qi, go!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that dandan was breaking through. It was not enough to absorb the divine Qi from the outside. He waved his hand and three thousand divine crystals flew out toward dandan.</p><p>The divine crystal shattered and turned into divine Qi that was absorbed by dandan.</p><p>After absorbing these divine crystals, dandan’s aura reached its peak, and then it converged again.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve broken through and finally reached the martial G.o.d Realm!</p><p>A Savage voice came out and soared into the sky. The divine power in his body shook, and he was insufferably arrogant.</p><p>He felt that he was filled with an incomparably strong power that seemed to be inexhaustible.</p><p>He swept his gaze and saw Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come, come. Let’s have a match. I won’t be surpa.s.sed by you. I’ll let you know how powerful I am!”</p><p>Dandan shouted arrogantly.</p><p>“Oh, sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned, stepped into the air, and slapped him.</p><p>A large purple-gold hand formed and pressed down on dandan.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming made his move, dandan’s expression changed. She tried her best to resist but it was useless. Under the big hand, dandan fell to the ground like a meteorite, stirring up dust.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, you tricked me …”</p><p>The next moment, dandan rushed out with a dejected face, looking as miserable as she could be.</p><p>“Hahahahaha …”</p><p>The t.i.tan Longhorn and the others laughed so hard that they were bent over, tears flowing down their faces.</p><p>“You were the one who wanted to challenge me!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an innocent look.</p><p>“You … You’re a pervert …”</p><p>Dandan held back for a long time before she managed to hold back this sentence.</p><p>He had thought that after his breakthrough, his combat strength had increased tremendously and the divine power he controlled was extraordinary. He thought that he could compete with Lu Ming. Now, it seemed that he was wrong.</p><p>He made up his mind that in the future, unless he was very confident, he would never challenge Lu Ming.</p><p>old turtle, you’re breaking through to the martial G.o.d Realm. Aren’t you going to treat us to a drink? ”</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go and drink some wine …”</p><p>Qing Cang, the t.i.tanos, and the others dragged dandan away and asked her to treat them to a drink.</p><p>As the people from the heaven realm became stronger and stronger, everyone’s mood became more relaxed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
