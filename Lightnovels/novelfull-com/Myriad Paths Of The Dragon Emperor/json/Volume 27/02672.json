He killed dozens of fellow disciples in the forest. He deserves to die ten thousand times!</p><p>Le Zhong said coldly.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were shocked by his words!</p><p>Was it true that Lu Ming had killed dozens of his fellow disciples?</p><p>“You’re slandering me!”</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and stepped forward. His eyes were bright as he stared at le Zhong and said,”Deacon le Zhong, do you have any evidence that I killed my fellow disciple?”</p><p>those disciples were clearly killed by you. You still dare to quibble? ”</p><p>Le Zhong said coldly.</p><p>“What excuse? I’m asking you, do you have evidence? Did you see it with your green eyes or did you have other witnesses?”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>He was speechless for a moment. Although he was certain that he was killed by Lu Ming and the rest, how could he have any evidence?</p><p>“That means there’s no evidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his voice and said,”since there’s no evidence, why did Deacon le Zhong say that I killed him?” Why didn’t he die in the hands of a plant life form? why didn’t he die in the hands of others?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions in a row, pressing on step by step.</p><p>“You still dare to quibble!”</p><p>He roared in the midst of the music, like a furious Lion, and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>He found it hard to defend himself. Was he supposed to say that the disciples who had died were killed because they had surrounded Lu Ming and that Lu Ming was the murderer?</p><p>However, could he say that?</p><p>“The few of us have been honestly hunting for plant life in the forest, but we didn’t expect to be slandered like this. Elder le Zhong, I want to know why? Did Huang Wu ask you to slander me? Or are you from the Tianhong sect? I did offend both of them.”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>“Oh, I understand!”</p><p>I understand now. Lu Ming has offended the Tianhong faction and Deacon le Zhong is from the Tianhong faction!</p><p>Many people’s hearts moved, and they had an expression of sudden realization.</p><p>Le Zhong was at a loss for words after being questioned by Lu Ming. He definitely did not have any evidence.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had offended the Tianhong faction and le Zhong happened to be a member of the Tianhong faction. Many people thought that le Zhong was taking the opportunity to take revenge and slander Lu Ming.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Le Zhong gritted his teeth and his heart was burning with anger, but he was helpless.</p><p>“This old fellow is indeed from Huang Wu’s side or Tianhong’s faction. Perhaps, those people who tried to kill me earlier were also intentionally allowed to do so by this old fellow …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He was just making things up to test the other party. Seeing that the other party did not say anything, he knew that he had guessed correctly.</p><p>alright, it seems like this is a misunderstanding. Deacon le Zhong, in the future, you should not be so impulsive. Go back!</p><p>The outer sect elder spoke. He had a rough idea in his heart, but this was a dispute between factions. He didn’t want to interfere too much, so he just tried to smooth things over.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a divine combat sword appeared and expanded rapidly. He landed on the combat sword first.</p><p>Le Zhong cast a very cold glance at Lu Ming and his eyes landed on his combat sword.</p><p>Then, the others all landed on their swords. The swords turned into a rainbow light and disappeared.</p><p>Soon, they returned to the outer gate area.</p><p>After returning, Lu Ming parted ways with Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun. He returned to his room and went into seclusion to cultivate.</p><p>He had many things to do next.</p><p>On one side, he had to temper his Shen power and strengthen his Foundation. On the other, he had to comprehend the ‘battle’ character.</p><p>The word ‘battle’ in his sea of consciousness was simply unfathomable. Lu Ming felt that up until now, he had only comprehended the surface of it. There was endless potential waiting for him to unearth.</p><p>Now, if he wanted to trigger the tripled combat power, the chance was one in a few dozen.</p><p>Only when his understanding of the battle formula deepened would the chances of this increase.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming still had to cultivate the three apocalyptic strikes and the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. He felt that he did not have enough time.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the rest of the time fully focused on cultivation.</p><p>……</p><p>Huang Wu’s courtyard.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n b.a.s.t.a.r.d!”</p><p>Huang Wu roared.</p><p>This time, he had invited many experts from the floating light Faction to kill Lu Ming in the forest. However, he had received news that those experts were all dead!</p><p>These people went to hunt Lu Ming together but they all died at the same time. It could not be a coincidence. Huang Wu suspected that Lu Ming was the one who did it.</p><p>However, was Lu Ming that powerful?</p><p>“Senior brother Huang Wu, that kid Lu Ming is very strange. Should we consult senior brother Huang Wen?”</p><p>One of the lackeys said carefully.</p><p>my big brother has been in closed-door cultivation recently. Let’s wait for him to come out first. That kid, let him live for a while longer!</p><p>Huang Wu said coldly.</p><p>At the same time, the people from the Tianhong sect were also furious. They brought back the news happily, suspecting that the young man in luxurious clothes and the rest from the Tianhong sect had died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>A storm was brewing.</p><p>In the outer sect area, where the female disciples lived.</p><p>The mountains and rivers here were verdant, and there were countless strange peaks.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s figure flickered in a Hidden Valley. Runes emerged from his hand and landed on the ground. A mysterious formation was faintly visible on the ground.</p><p>After a few hours, Xie nianjun finally stopped. He let out a sigh of relief and made a hand seal. With a light shout, the formation glowed and condensed into a tiny ray of light. It shot into the sky and disappeared in an instant. The speed was unimaginable.</p><p>I hope you’ll receive it. Staying here is too slow. It’s not a long-term solution!</p><p>Xie nianjun murmured. Then, he sat down cross-legged and began to cultivate.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed.</p><p>One day, Xie nianjun suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>The s.p.a.ce in front of Xie nianjun rippled and an old man in a gray robe suddenly appeared.</p><p>“Uncle Hong …”</p><p>Xie nianjun exclaimed in surprise when he saw the grey-robed elder.</p><p>The grey-robed old man’s eyes seemed to have stars in them as he studied Xie nianjun. His aged face was filled with joy.</p><p>“Big … Young miss, it’s you, it’s really you. You’ve successfully reincarnated?”</p><p>The grey-robed elder was so excited that his voice started to tremble.</p><p>“After reincarnating for so many years, I’ve succeeded by luck!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said. She felt much more relaxed after seeing the old man in gray.</p><p>“Thank G.o.d, thank G.o.d!”</p><p>The grey-robed old man sighed with tears in his eyes. He looked at Xie nianjun lovingly and said after a while, ” “I wonder how the second young lady is doing?”</p><p>she’s also nearby. I’ll call her over!</p><p>Xie nianjun said. He then took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Second miss is here too? Could it be that the second lady has also successfully reincarnated?”</p><p>The grey-robed elder was even more excited.</p><p>“She said it was a success, so it’s a success, but it’s not a complete success!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“It can’t be considered a complete success? What’s going on?”</p><p>The grey-robed elder asked.</p><p>her obsession in this life is too strong, so she swallowed her previous life in this life. Her will is now in this life. She’s not completely Tang Qing anymore!</p><p>Xie nianjun sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
