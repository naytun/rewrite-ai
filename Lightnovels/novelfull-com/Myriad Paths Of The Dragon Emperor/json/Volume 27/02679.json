Where can i sell divine artifacts here? I’ll sell them and Exchange them for some points!</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>In the end, he decided to go to the divine pulse tower to cultivate.</p><p>No matter how many divine crystals he had, it was useless to keep them. The only way was to convert them into power.</p><p>&Nbsp; he still had some middle-quality divine artifacts on hand that he could sell.</p><p>“Let’s go, I’ll Take You There!”</p><p>The young lady led the way, followed by Lu Ming. Not long after, they arrived at a bustling place.</p><p>This place was the place in the inner sect area where people exchanged and sold all kinds of treasures.</p><p>At the moment, Lu Ming still had eleven middle-grade divine artifacts.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to sell six of them and keep five.</p><p>The price of a middle grade divine artifact was naturally not something that a low grade divine artifact could compare to.</p><p>A good level nine low grade G.o.d artifact could be sold for 100000 G.o.d crystals. As for a middle grade G.o.d artifact, even the lowest level one middle grade G.o.d artifact could be sold for several hundred thousand.</p><p>Lu Ming sold six items. Among them, there were three level one middle-grade divine artifacts, two level two middle-grade divine artifacts, and one level three middle-grade divine artifact.</p><p>After selling it, he got a total of 3.6 million G.o.d crystals.</p><p>The young girl widened her eyes in shock. She did not expect Lu Ming to be so rich.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bought a huge pile of divine artifact fragments. They were all fragments of divine artifacts of Level Seven low-grade and above. There were fragments of Level Seven low-grade to level nine low-grade divine artifacts. Lu Ming spent two hundred thousand divine crystals on the huge pile.</p><p>These divine artifact fragments were enough for QiuQiu to eat for a period of time.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming followed Yue Linglong to the points redemption main hall. He used 1.6 million points to redeem 160 points.</p><p>“Let’s go and cultivate!”</p><p>With a large number of points, Lu Ming was full of pride. He waved his hand and walked towards the divine pulse tower with Yue Linglong.</p><p>is this the divine pulse tower? it looks ordinary!</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the foot of a giant tower.</p><p>The tower looked very ancient, but it didn’t give off any aura, as if it were just made of some random giant stones.</p><p>let’s go. The effect of cultivation on each floor of the divine pulse tower is almost the same. It’s one point a day!</p><p>Yue Linglong said and walked toward the divine pulse tower.</p><p>Someone was guarding the divine pulse tower.</p><p>“Take out your ident.i.ty tokens and register!”</p><p>An old man at the foot of the divine pulse tower said.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yue Linglong took out their ident.i.ty tokens and handed them to the old man.</p><p>The points were all recorded in their ident.i.ty tokens.</p><p>The old man placed their ident.i.ty tokens on a disk array. The disk array flashed a few times and returned the ident.i.ty tokens to the two.</p><p>go in. Remember, one point will be consumed for one day of cultivation in the divine pulse tower. When the points in your ident.i.ty tokens are used up, the formation of the divine pulse tower will throw you out, but you’ll be embarra.s.sed. So, you’d better get out of the divine pulse tower before your points are used up!</p><p>The old man warned.</p><p>The two of them nodded and walked into the divine pulse tower.</p><p>There were secret rooms in the divine pulse tower. All the secret rooms on the first floor were occupied. The two of them went to the second floor.</p><p>h.e.l.lo, Lu Ming. If you have any questions in the future, you can ask me. Here!</p><p>With that, Yue Linglong pa.s.sed Lu Ming a voice transmission jade talisman and walked into a secret room.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and entered a secret room. The door of the secret room closed automatically.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and started cultivating with the universe thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Immediately, the rich divine Qi in the surroundings gathered towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>The divine Qi here was so dense that it was almost tangible. It was many times faster than absorbing divine crystals.</p><p>It even contained a trace of strange energy. Once it entered Lu Ming’s body, it was quickly transformed into Lu Ming’s divine power and could even help to temper his divine body.</p><p>so fast. The cultivation speed here is many times faster than outside. Ten thousand divine crystals. It’s worth it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Before, he had been worried about the divine crystals. Ten thousand divine crystals could only help him cultivate for a day.</p><p>But now, he felt that it was worth it.</p><p>Although it was very expensive, he would definitely be able to break through quickly and break through his cultivation.</p><p>However, before he focused on cultivation, Lu Ming took out a pile of divine artifact fragments and put them aside for QiuQiu to eat slowly. As for him, he began to focus on cultivation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had skyrocketed and he was already at peak third-level virtual G.o.d-level, only a step away from fourth-level virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>One had to know that it was not easy to break through to the void G.o.d Realm. Many people would need hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of years to do so.</p><p>He, on the other hand, had only used three months to reach the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm. This was all because of the divine pulse tower.</p><p>“Begin the a.s.sault!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and the divine energy in his body quickly circulated.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>His body seemed to be rumbling as he started to break through to the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Not long after, his aura skyrocketed, and it was much stronger than before.</p><p>Fourth level void G.o.d Realm, breakthrough!</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. Now that he had broken through to the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm, Lu Ming was even more confident in his battle with Dongfang Hao.</p><p>it’s worth it to break through to the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm in three months!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although he didn’t need 900000 divine crystals to break through to the fourth level of the void G.o.d Realm, it would take dozens or even hundreds of times longer.</p><p>In the divine pulse tower, he had broken through in three months, which was equivalent to spending a large number of divine crystals to buy time.</p><p>What Lu Ming lacked the most now was time.</p><p>It was all worth it. He could earn more divine crystals once his cultivation increased.</p><p>in less than a year, my cultivation has increased by two levels. I need to stop and Polish it. I can use the rest of my time to cultivate my divine skills.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was now more confident in his fight against Dongfang Hao, he could not afford to miss out on the ninefold golden armor and the three apocalyptic strikes if he wanted to be 100% confident.</p><p>If these two divine skills had a breakthrough, he would be more confident.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately left the divine pulse tower.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask if there’s a place to cultivate a divine skill in the inner sect?”</p><p>When he arrived outside the divine pulse tower, Lu Ming asked the elder who was guarding the divine pulse tower.</p><p>“There are some places that ordinary disciples are forbidden from entering …”</p><p>The old man glanced at Lu Ming and said indifferently.</p><p>“Senior, this is my token!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the gold token again.</p><p>“A gold token!”</p><p>The old man’s eyes suddenly widened. He sized Lu Ming up carefully in surprise.</p><p>He obviously did not expect that Lu Ming, a virtual G.o.d-level disciple, would have a gold token.</p><p>with the gold token, you can go to most of the places in the inner sect area. The best place to cultivate a divine skill is, of course, the divine skill Valley. I have a map of the inner sect area here, you can use it!</p><p>The old man took out a map and pa.s.sed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>The reason why he was so nice to Lu Ming was naturally because he guessed that Lu Ming was the disciple of some Big Shot and he wanted to befriend and build a good relationship with Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
