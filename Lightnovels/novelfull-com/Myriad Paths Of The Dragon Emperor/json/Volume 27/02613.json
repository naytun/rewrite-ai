Fine, half it is, but the formation here is very strong and difficult to break. Next, we’ll need all of free and unfettered sect’s experts to attack together!”</p><p>“This is only natural!”</p><p>Situ haonan revealed a smile.</p><p>Immediately, the experts from the yuanluo Palace and the Walkabout sect joined forces to attack the formation.</p><p>With the two of them working together, their speed increased greatly. It only took them a month to break through the formation and open the door.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The experts from both sides rushed into the gate, ready to plunder the treasures.</p><p>But after entering, he was dumbfounded.</p><p>It was clean and there was nothing inside.</p><p>They came to the place where Lu Ming had taken the pills. There were a few shelves but there was nothing on the shelves.</p><p>Empty?</p><p>The palace master’s face was extremely gloomy. His chest heaved up and down, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Could it be that this cave abode was empty, and the owner of the cave abode did not leave anything behind?</p><p>It shouldn’t be!</p><p>This was a deity’s cave abode.</p><p>According to common sense, even if such a person left, he would take some valuable treasures with him, but he would always leave behind some unimportant items.</p><p>They might not be important to heavenly deities, but to them, they might all be priceless treasures.</p><p>But how could there be nothing?</p><p>“Search, search carefully!”</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall roared.</p><p>They searched inside and out, but they couldn’t find a single hair.</p><p>In the end, they came to the depths of this area. There was a pa.s.sage here that was blocked by an extremely powerful formation.</p><p>“There’s more inside. Perhaps, the deeper part of the cave is inside? Perhaps the treasures are all inside?”</p><p>The hall Master of the yuanluo Hall and the others consoled themselves with this thought.</p><p>Then, he had no choice but to continue working hard and bombarding the formation.</p><p>However, the formation here was even more powerful than the previous one.</p><p>Even an expert from the Walkabout sect would need a long time to break through it.</p><p>Time pa.s.sed quickly. It had been two years since Lu Ming entered the hurricane pa.s.sageway.</p><p>Lu Ming made rapid progress in the continuous fighting. His cultivation level had unknowingly reached the peak of six-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming found another pit and started to break through to the next realm.</p><p>In the end, he successfully broke through the realm and became a seven-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally reached the peak of seven-star heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The next step was to combine all 10000 elements into one and form the divine fire.</p><p>After condensing the divine fire, he would be able to break through to the martial G.o.d Realm and enter the second step of cultivation.</p><p>To the current Lu Ming, it was not particularly difficult for him to gather 10000 elements into one and condense the divine fire.</p><p>This was because when Lu Ming came to the primeval universe, his small world had already merged with the primeval universe and transformed into pure World Energy and Dominator energy.</p><p>Moreover, as Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the proportion of the ruler’s power in his body increased.</p><p>Now, the proportion of the Dominator’s power in Lu Ming’s body had reached ninety-nine percent. Only one percent of the world’s power was left.</p><p>As long as he could convert all the energy in his body into the Dominator’s power, Lu Ming could begin to attempt the 10000 elements return to one and condense the divine fire.</p><p>This trip to the cave abode had helped Lu Ming save a lot of time.</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>After the breakthrough, Lu Ming continued to move forward along the pa.s.sageway.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>&Nbsp; Hong long long …</p><p>This time, after Lu Ming had walked for a while, he not only heard the terrifying whistling of the strong wind, but also deafening collision sounds.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward for a while and realized that he had finally reached the end of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>At the end of the pa.s.sage, there were several other pa.s.sages that intersected and converged.</p><p>Each pa.s.sage was filled with strong wind. The wind from several pa.s.sages collided with each other, creating a shocking explosion.</p><p>Furthermore, the wind from the few tunnels converged into an even larger tunnel, making the wind in that tunnel even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that if he were to enter, he would not be able to resist for long before his body was torn apart by the strong wind.</p><p>“It seems that I can only stop here. I’m afraid I can’t enter the depths of the cave abode!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>“Eh, there’s a cave here?”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming noticed a dark cave beside the wall. He climbed along the wall and looked into the cave. It was dark and bottomless.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming had not found any similar caves.</p><p>Where did this cave lead to?</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely curious. He pondered for a moment and decided to take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the power of domination. His eyes glowed. He could see everything in the dark cave.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the cave. There was no wind in the cave.</p><p>Lu Ming walked carefully along the cave. He reached the end of the cave after walking for a few thousand meters.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming realized that he had come to a huge platform.</p><p>The platform was very wide, and on one side of the platform, the sound of the wind could be heard.</p><p>Lu Ming walked over to take a look and realized that in the direction of the platform, there was a hurricane pa.s.sage. The strong wind there was extremely terrifying. It was many times stronger than the ones that Lu Ming had encountered before.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was a little grave. He did not dare to approach and stayed away from the hurricane pa.s.sage. He sized up the other places on the platform.</p><p>On the other side of the platform, there was a stone door. Lu Ming pushed the door open and entered, only to discover a pa.s.sageway.</p><p>There were some rooms on both sides of the pa.s.sage.</p><p>“Eh? Could these be the bedroom?”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there were stone tables and stone beds in these rooms. However, they were all very ordinary and did not contain any treasures.</p><p>The next few rooms were all ordinary stone tables and beds. They were of no value.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he came to the last room.</p><p>There were some shelves in the room, and on them were weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart began to beat rapidly. He picked up a combat sword nearby and infused his ruler’s power into it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The combat sword began to glow, and a powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>“This … This is a level nine low grade G.o.d equipment!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s breathing quickened and his eyes were burning.</p><p>This was definitely a level nine low grade G.o.d equipment.</p><p>The meteor spear that Lu Ming had bought was only a level six low-grade divine artifact, but it was worth seven thousand divine crystals.</p><p>A level nine low grade divine artifact’s price was at least several times higher. It could be sold for seventy to eighty thousand divine crystals, or even a hundred thousand divine crystals.</p><p>“There are words below!”</p><p>Lu Ming discovered that there was a small sign hanging on the hilt of the sword. There were words written on it.</p><p>Gu Yue sword, a level nine low quality G.o.d artifact!</p><p>On the sign, there was a line of words.</p><p>“It really is a level nine low grade G.o.d artifact!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and kept it quickly. He then looked at the other weapons.</p><p>“Breeze hook, a level nine low grade G.o.d equipment!”</p><p>“Separation and reunion saber, level eight low grade G.o.d artifact!”</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming looked at six to seven weapons in a row. All of them were Level Seven low-grade divine artifacts or above.</p><p>“I’m rich,. ‘m rich, I’m rich …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself.</p><p>This time, he was really rich. Lu Ming never expected that he would have such a great harvest after pa.s.sing through the hurricane tunnel.</p><p>six-Battle rod, a middle-grade level one divine artifact!</p><p>When Lu Ming picked up a long rod and took a look, his eyes immediately lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
