His combat strength had improved.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The combat sword slashed through the air, and the two blood-red roots were cut in half, blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming attacked rapidly, his combat sword slashing out continuously. At this moment, his combat strength had reached its peak in history.</p><p>A few more tentacles were cut off.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The sanguine ancient tree seemed to be in pain. Hundreds of its roots danced wildly and shrieked. Then, the hundreds of tentacles wrapped around Lu Ming, trying to strangle him to death and devour his blood.</p><p>However, QiuQiu transformed into a semi-circular shield and blocked in front of Lu Ming. The roots bombarded QiuQiu’s body. QiuQiu’s body was like mercury. It caved in from the impact and returned to its original state the next moment.</p><p>Moreover, QiuQiu was a metallic lifeform and had no blood at all. The ancient blood-colored tree was completely helpless against QiuQiu.</p><p>“Dark holy light technique!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun joined forces and activated the dark holy light technique. Black and white light intertwined to form a dark holy light cage that enveloped the ancient blood-red Tree.</p><p>“Good chance, ball ball, smash!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pounced on the ancient blood-red Tree like a ROC.</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu turned into a huge metal ball and smashed toward the ancient blood-red Tree.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The blood-red ancient tree waved its hundreds of roots wildly, bombarding the dark holy light cage, causing the cage to shake continuously.</p><p>In addition, blood spikes emerged from the blood-colored ancient tree’s body, flying in all directions like a Hedgehog.</p><p>QiuQiu was the first to pa.s.s through the Holy Light cage and crash down, sweeping away some blood spikes and blood-colored roots.</p><p>Lu Ming followed closely behind QiuQiu and slashed with his sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s slash left a wound that was a few meters long and half as deep on the ancient blood-colored tree. Blood gushed out like a spring.</p><p>The ancient blood-colored tree’s aura also rapidly weakened.</p><p>“Again, slash!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword again. This time, the ancient blood-red Tree was completely split into two.</p><p>The blood-colored ancient tree was split in half and fell to the ground. Blood flowed all over the ground, giving off a disgusting smell.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. This ancient blood-red Tree was very terrifying. They had to join forces and use all means to kill it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful …”</p><p>Suddenly, Xie nianqing cried out anxiously. He pounced on Lu Ming and set up a sword screen in front of him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A particularly thick blood-colored root slammed into the sword curtain in front of Xie nianqing. The sword curtain collapsed instantly, and Xie nianqing was thrown back like a kite with a broken string, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>“Little Qing …”</p><p>Lu Ming turned pale with fright. He moved and hugged Xie nianqing by the waist. Xie nianqing’s face was pale. He had been seriously injured by the attack.</p><p>Rustle … Rustle …</p><p>Rustling sounds came from both sides of the abyss. Then, huge creatures appeared in their sight.</p><p>Ancient blood-colored trees, they were all ancient blood-colored trees. At a glance, there were at least dozens of them.</p><p>One of them was especially tall, twice as tall as the other blood-colored ancient trees. Its thick roots waved around and made loud sounds.</p><p>“So many!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and the others felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>It was already difficult to deal with one blood-colored ancient tree. How could they deal with so many of them?</p><p>Furthermore, there was a terrifying gravitational pull in this abyss. They couldn’t even fly or escape.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that I’m going to die Here today!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind and he was very unwilling.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s body emitted a holy light. She was unwilling to die Here as she still had things to do.</p><p>She was going to risk her life!</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Dozens of blood-colored ancient trees let out ear-piercing screeches. Their roots waved like a group of demons dancing. The scene was terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The tallest and thickest blood-colored ancient tree made its move. A blood-colored root as thick as a bucket whipped toward Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Xie nianjun shouted as holy light filled the air. His entire body seemed to have become one with the sword, turning into a holy sword and slashing at the root.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword Qi spread and the Holy Light was destroyed. Xie nianjun was sent flying and fell to the ground. Her body trembled and she spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The giant blood-red ancient tree was too strong for Xie nianjun to withstand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The thick root continued to lash at them.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and rushed out. He circulated his ruler’s divine power to the maximum. The combat sword in his hand glowed with a dazzling purple-gold light as he slashed at the thick root.</p><p>However, the result was the same as before. Lu Ming felt a surge of terrifying power surging towards him and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>It couldn’t be blocked, it couldn’t be blocked at all.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Dozens of sanguine ancient trees waved their roots and shrieked continuously. They slowly approached Lu Ming. They were not in a hurry to attack, as if they were toying with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Dozens of blood-colored ancient trees formed a circle, waving their roots. They were like a cage, completely surrounding Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There was no way to escape!</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s small hand was holding Lu Ming’s big hand tightly.</p><p>QiuQiu, they can’t do anything to you. Wait a moment, you take the opportunity to escape!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu.</p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p>QiuQiu’s round body spun around with all its might, looking like it was rejecting the offer.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>At this moment, the largest ancient blood tree shrieked madly, as if it had given its last order. Then, all the other ancient blood trees attacked together.</p><p>Tens of thousands of roots wrapped around Lu Ming and the rest. They were about to be drowned by the endless blood-colored roots.</p><p>At this moment, the shocking feather portrait in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness moved. It flew out of Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and hovered above Lu Ming’s head. It emitted a dazzling purple-gold light, like a light shield, enveloping Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The tentacles. .h.i.t the light shield, but they were all blocked.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely surprised.</p><p>Jing Yu’s portrait had actually moved at this moment.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had also encountered fatal danger. However, the Jingyu portrait had never moved. Why did it move now?</p><p>“Could it be related to my breakthrough to the ethereal G.o.d Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Bai Ya had once said that there were layers of restrictions on Jingyu’s portrait. It could only be activated when Lu Ming’s cultivation had reached a certain level.</p><p>Perhaps, Jing Yu’s portrait only had such a reaction when Lu Ming’s cultivation level had broken through to virtual G.o.d-level.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of Jing Yu’s portrait lit up like two stars, and an unparalleled pressure exploded forth.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>The blood-colored ancient trees seemed to be extremely terrified. They screamed and waved their roots, running away. In the blink of an eye, not a single tree was left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
