This made Lu Ming very excited. He was about to continue forward with Yue Linglong to kill more netherdragons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful pressure descended from the sky. It was filled with a domineering aura. Then, a few young men slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>“Huang Chengan!”</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes slightly. There were three young men in total. One of them was Huang Chengan, who was ranked 98th on the virtual G.o.d ranking back then.</p><p>Of course, after Lu Ming defeated three people in a row and the 51st-ranked Scorpion Tiger, Huang Chengan’s ranking had dropped by one to 99.</p><p>Lu Ming was not concerned about Huang Chengan but the other two, especially the youth in black armor.</p><p>This black-armored young man had a strong and tall figure. His entire body was covered in black armor, even his palms were covered by the black armor. Only his head was exposed, and he was filled with an overbearing aura.</p><p>“Kuangdao, it’s the little tyrant kuangdao!”</p><p>Yue Linglong exclaimed in surprise when she saw the youth in black armor.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was moved.</p><p>During this period of time, he had gained some understanding of some of the people who were ranked at the top of the virtual G.o.d List.</p><p>The little tyrant said madly. He was ranked fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>This was an extremely terrifying figure. In the entire outer sect, the number of outer sect disciples who could suppress him could be counted on one hand.</p><p>The top ten on the virtual G.o.d ranking list all had shocking battle records and had defeated true G.o.d-level existences before.</p><p>This was terrifying. The Scorpion Tiger had only once escaped from the hands of a true G.o.d Realm expert. It was completely different from being defeated. The difference was huge.</p><p>It was said that the top three on the virtual G.o.d ranking list had the power to kill true G.o.d Realm experts. He was even more amazing.</p><p>The little tyrant said madly. Although he didn’t have the strength to kill true G.o.d stage experts, he had defeated true G.o.d stage experts many times, so his battle strength was beyond doubt.</p><p>“You’re Lu Ming, the one who killed many of my junior brothers from the transient light sect?”</p><p>Kuang Dao’s eyes were like those of a ferocious beast. He stared at Lu Ming with cold killing intent.</p><p>“If people don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them. If people provoke me, I’ll kill them all, no matter who they are!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently.</p><p>“Hehe, is that so? Kill them all? Let’s see if you have the ability to do so.”</p><p>Kuang Dao’s face turned even colder. The aura on his body exploded and a violent pressure, like a mountain, pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Huang Chengan and the other young man’s figures flickered. They formed a triangular formation and surrounded Lu Ming and Yue Linglong in the middle to prevent them from escaping.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you fought so many people in a row in the life-and-death arena. I wasn’t there at that time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have allowed you to be so arrogant!”</p><p>Another blue-robed youth said. This person was called LAN Shang and she was also an expert on the virtual G.o.d rank. She was ranked 33rd on the virtual G.o.d rank.</p><p>you talk too much. Don’t you know that villains usually die because they talk too much? ”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at LAN Shang.</p><p>“You’re looking for death. Senior brother kuangdao, leave this brat to me!”</p><p>LAN Shang’s eyes were cold as a saber appeared in her hand.</p><p>It was a pity that they did not know that Lu Ming had already defeated Lu Yang and Fang ya.</p><p>Although Lu Yang and Fang ya’s ranking on the virtual G.o.d ranking list was slightly lower than Lan Chang’s, their combined strength was definitely above Lan Chang’s.</p><p>If he knew, he would not be so confident.</p><p>“Ten heavenly blades!”</p><p>die! LAN Shang shouted coldly. Her saber Qi soared into the sky and a ray of blue Saber Light, crystal clear but full of terrifying power, slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and he pulled it out.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the long spear lashed out, a violent explosion resounded in the heavens and earth. Then, the long spear struck LAN Shang’s saber radiance.</p><p>“Break … Ah …”</p><p>LAN Shang began to roar and wanted to break Lu Ming’s spear radiance. However, the next moment, her eyes widened and she let out a shrill scream.</p><p>Not only did he fail to break Lu Ming’s spear radiance, but his own saber radiance was also shattered. The long spear struck LAN Shang’s body with irresistible force.</p><p>The blue-shirted man cried out in pain. His body flew out like a cannonball, leaving a long trail of air behind him before he crashed into a mountain peak.</p><p>The mountain peak crumbled, and LAN Shang’s body was lying among a pile of rocks. Her body twitched non-stop, and she was already half-dead.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Huang Chengan’s eyes widened. He was almost scared to death. His body instinctively retreated.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Even the eyes of the little tyrant narrowed as he spoke madly.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Although LAN Shang’s combat strength was far inferior to his, she was already one of the top powerhouses among virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses. Now, she was actually half-dead from Lu Ming’s spear.</p><p>so you have some strength. No wonder you’re so arrogant. However, this bit of strength is still not enough in my hands!</p><p>Kuang Dao spoke and his Shen power exploded. His tall figure seemed even more powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Kuang Dao stepped forward. His body was like a mountain, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let me see how strong you are, tyrannical divine fist!”</p><p>Kuang Dao roared. The black armor on his body burst out with a dazzling black light and he threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>His fist was wrapped in black armor. He threw a punch that was as heavy as a mountain at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He circulated his divine power with all his might. Four divine flames burned fiercely in his dantian. His divine power gushed out and poured into the long spear. Then, he shot out the spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was as if two meteors had exploded, and the sky rumbled as terrifying shockwaves spread out in all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure retreated several dozen miles and stood in the void, breathing heavily.</p><p>This figure was Kuang Dao.</p><p>“What … How is that possible?”</p><p>Huang Chengan’s heart trembled in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was simply shocking. Even Kuang Dao, who was ranked fifth on the virtual G.o.d ranking list, was forced to retreat by Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>kid, not bad. Your strength is not bad. Then take another move from me. Tyrannical divine fist, fist rules the world!</p><p>Kuang Dao let out a long howl and the aura on his body became even more terrifying. Then, he threw a punch. A fist force, like a meteorite, rumbled towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying force of the fist kept pressing down on Lu Ming from a long distance.</p><p>divine skill, peak stage two!</p><p>At a glance, Lu Ming could tell the level of mastery of the mad man’s divine skill.</p><p>Kuang Dao’s divine power was definitely at the top of the king grade divine power and was very close to the divine grade divine power. His divine skill had been cultivated to the peak of the second stage. Together with his black armor, the power was shocking.</p><p>With this punch, even someone like LAN Shang would be killed.</p><p>the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes, sky-breaking!</p><p>Lu Ming used the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>Although the &lt; three apocalyptic strikes &gt; was only at the peak of the first stage, the power of the three apocalyptic strikes was already extremely strong. With the addition of the battle character formula, the explosive power was not weak at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A shooting star-like spear light burst out and collided with Kuang Dao’s fist force.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>An even more terrifying explosion was heard, and the violent force swept in all directions.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Huang Chengan’s expression changed drastically as he retreated. Otherwise, he would have been injured by the scattered Qi.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
