With a single glance, one could tell that they were terrifying experts.</p><p>“Two seniors, I want to go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“You’re going in? Little fellow, hurry up and leave. Outer disciples are not allowed to enter unless there are special circ.u.mstances!”</p><p>A burly Man in Black casually waved his hand and revealed a look of contempt.</p><p>They could tell at a glance that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at third-level void G.o.d Realm. With such a cultivation, even in the outer sect, he would be at the bottom. How dare he enter the inner sect?</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He knew that this would happen. The last time he came here, he was not stopped because he was with Huo Quan. This time, he was alone. It was normal for him to be stopped.</p><p>“Seniors, this is my token!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the gold token.</p><p>“Token? what token?”</p><p>The two men in Black casually glanced over, and their eyes instantly widened.</p><p>“Huang … Gold token!”</p><p>The two of them were tongue-tied and almost bit their own tongues.</p><p>They had never expected that Lu Ming would have a gold token.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, there were very few people who had a gold token.</p><p>Apart from a few Holy Sons and holy virgins, only a few people had golden tokens, but they all had n.o.ble ident.i.ties.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was merely a third-level void G.o.d. They had never seen him before. How could he have a gold token?</p><p>“Could it be … This kid is a disciple secretly taken in by some Big Shot?”</p><p>The two black-robed men thought to themselves, and their faces immediately revealed a respectful expression.</p><p>“So it turns out that little brother has a gold token, then you can naturally enter. Please, please come in!”</p><p>The two of them immediately changed their expressions, nodding and bowing, trying to please him.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and was about to step in.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a delicate shout came from behind.</p><p>There was a flash of light and a young and beautiful girl appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>The young lady’s skin was like jade, and her facial features were exquisite. She was a rare beauty.</p><p>She blinked her big eyes and sized Lu Ming up curiously. “Who are you? I’ve never seen it before, where did you get the gold token?”</p><p>“Miss, I don’t think I need to tell you where I got the gold token!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“You won’t tell me? You just don’t dare to tell me, right? tell me, did you steal your gold token?”</p><p>The young girl widened her eyes, as if she wanted to see through Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. miss, the people who have the gold tokens all have high cultivation levels. Moreover, they’re all hidden in their storage rings. Where am I supposed to go to steal them? ”</p><p>“That’s true!” The young girl was stunned and pouted.</p><p>“Miss, I still have something to do, so I’ll take my leave first!”</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming walked toward the entrance.</p><p>hey, wait for me. You still haven’t told me where you got your gold token from!</p><p>The young girl shouted and followed Lu Ming.</p><p>The two men in Black seemed to be very familiar with the girl. They ignored her and allowed her to enter.</p><p>this girl’s ident.i.ty isn’t simple. She’s only at the void G.o.d Realm, but she didn’t stop him!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He could sense that the girl’s cultivation base hadn’t reached the true G.o.d Realm yet. She should still be at the ethereal G.o.d Realm.</p><p>Those at the void Spirit realm were considered to be in the outer sect, so they shouldn’t be able to enter the inner sect.</p><p>Of course, this was with the exception of some special people, such as the disciples or descendants of some great figure.</p><p>“Hey, you still haven’t told me where the gold token came from? Tell me, just tell me!”</p><p>The young girl followed Lu Ming closely and muttered to herself.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>He could tell that the young girl had no ill intentions towards him, and was just purely curious.</p><p>“Miss, I’ll tell you the truth. This gold token was given to me by the sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming said helplessly.</p><p>“Did the sect master give it to you?”</p><p>The young girl blinked her big eyes and became even more curious, ” “Why did the sect master give you a gold token? What’s your relationship with the sect master? Could it be that you’re the sect master’s private disciple? Or, are you the sect master’s illegitimate child?”</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming almost spat out a mouthful of blood three feet away.</p><p>What was this little girl thinking? The hole in his brain was too big!</p><p>“Don’t make wild guesses. It’s not what you think!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If it’s not what I’m thinking, then what is it?”</p><p>The young girl asked again.</p><p>Lu Ming was powerless. He could not be bothered with the young girl and strode forward. However, the young girl was like a shadow, following Lu Ming closely. She seemed to be determined not to give up until she figured out what was going on.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the other party. He buried his head in his journey.</p><p>“Hey, I’m Yue Linglong, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Hey, where are you going?”</p><p>“Hey, that’s where the inner sect disciples go to the toilet. What are you doing there?”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped in his tracks, his face turning red.</p><p>“That … This is my first time in the inner sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming explained awkwardly.</p><p>“It’s your first time here. If you want to find a place, I can lead the way!”</p><p>The young lady smiled.</p><p>I want to find a place to cultivate. It’s best if it’s the kind of place that can quickly improve cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the divine pulse tower is the best place for cultivation. The divine Qi in the divine pulse tower is extremely dense. It even contains a trace of the power of the divine pulse, which can help people improve their cultivation quickly!</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>“Divine pulse tower? How do we get there?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Hey, you still haven’t told me your name!”</p><p>The young girl widened her eyes.</p><p>“My name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed drily and explained.</p><p>“Lu Ming? What an uncouth name!”</p><p>The young girl pouted while Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>let’s go. I’ll take you to the divine pulse tower. But I’ll tell you that you’ll have to spend points to cultivate in the divine pulse tower!</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>“Points? what points?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>“You don’t even know the points?”</p><p>The young lady rolled her eyes and had a look of disdain on her face. Lu Ming’s face turned even darker. He realized that he had been despised by the young lady many times in just a short while.</p><p>points. Of course, it’s sect points. You can obtain points by completing missions a.s.signed by the sect. The points are very useful in the sect. You can enter a cultivation place to cultivate, and you can even exchange them for divine artifacts, various divine skills, divine techniques, and secret skills!</p><p>The young girl explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. The Kong Xuan sect’s so-called points were like the contribution points in other places.</p><p>Lu Ming started to have a headache. He did not have any points at all. It seemed that he could not go.</p><p>you don’t have points, do you? How about this? do you have divine crystals? you can exchange divine crystals for points, but it’s not worth it. 10000 divine crystals can only be exchanged for one point. Cultivating in the divine pulse tower will cost one point a day!</p><p>The young girl said.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>This was too expensive.</p><p>It cost one point a day to cultivate in the divine pulse tower, which was equivalent to 10000 divine crystals. It was extremely shocking.</p><p>it’s a pity that I don’t have many points left. Otherwise, I could sell some to you at a lower price!</p><p>The young girl muttered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
