Is that alright?”</p><p>Situ Feng asked carefully.</p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>The expert from the unique devil Academy asked.</p><p>Situ Feng immediately told him about Kang long and situ xiaolai, including their ranking in the first round.</p><p>“Alright, sure!”</p><p>The expert from the unique devil Academy considered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>we have joined the unique devil Academy! We have joined the unique devil Academy!</p><p>Outside the dream s.p.a.ce, under the big screen, Kang long and situ Xiao naturally saw it. They were so excited that they were about to explode.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good!”</p><p>Situ haonan and Kang Ji were also overjoyed.</p><p>They only felt refreshed and their mood was at ease.</p><p>This way, they would not be afraid of the righteous Army.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually chosen the Kong Xuan sect. The Kong Xuan sect was only a top sect.</p><p>As for situ Feng, he had joined the Overlord force, the unique demon Academy.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was highly valued by Kong Xuan sect, situ Feng had become a disciple of the unique demon Academy and did not need to be afraid of Lu Ming.</p><p>As for the free and unfettered sect and the yuan Luo Palace, they wouldn’t need to fear the righteous Army anymore.</p><p>Sure enough, the eyes of some of the leaders of the forces in the chaotic astral River also flickered. They were considering their att.i.tude toward the righteous Army, the yuan Luo Palace, and the unfettered sect.</p><p>Although Lu Ming would be valued by the Kong Xuan sect …</p><p>However, Kong Xuan sect was only a top sect, while the Yimo Academy was the Overlord force.</p><p>It was hard to tell who was stronger between Lu Ming and situ Feng.</p><p>“Let’s not get involved in the battle between the two sides for now!”</p><p>The Masters of many forces in the chaotic astral River think this way.</p><p>However, after some of the top geniuses were chosen, the Qin heaven thirteen clans no longer took the initiative to invite people.</p><p>In the first round, those who were ranked in the top 100 in their respective battlefields were free to choose a sect. As long as the sect agreed, they could just register and it would be done.</p><p>One by one, the youths began to choose the Qin heaven thirteen clans and register their information.</p><p>A day later, all 1999 people who entered the second round had joined the Qin heaven thirteen clans.</p><p>as for those who are eliminated in the first round, in the next few days, if anyone is chosen by the Qin heaven thirteen clans, we will naturally send someone to inform you. If there is no news after seven days, it means that they have not been selected!</p><p>The middle-aged man announced.</p><p>Many people sighed and could only wait for the news nervously.</p><p>if you have anything to do, get it done within seven days. Seven days later, gather at the Kong Xuan sect’s base in Wanling city, and I’ll bring you to their headquarters!</p><p>The powerhouse from Kong Xuan sect said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded.</p><p>Then, everyone left the dream s.p.a.ce, and the screen above Wanling city disappeared.</p><p>In the next seven days, Wanling city was bustling with activity.</p><p>Some people were celebrating, while others were waiting anxiously.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest met up with the ancestor of technique and celebrated with each other.</p><p>Tong Xi ‘er had also successfully joined the Golden pool sect.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had pa.s.sed.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Xie nianjun arrived at the base of the Kong Xuan sect in the city of Wanling.</p><p>Myriad spirit planet was the largest commercial planet in the Qin heaven Star Zone. The Qin heaven 13 clans all had shops on myriad spirit planet and even caravans, so they naturally had bases.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others gathered in a huge mansion.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming and the group, there were some other people. The total number was about 150 people.</p><p>This was the total number of disciples that the Kong Xuan sect had recruited this time.</p><p>In the vast Qin heaven Galaxy, more than a million geniuses were selected. In the end, the Kong Xuan sect only selected 150 people.</p><p>This probability could be said to be very low.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the others arrived, many eyes turned to them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two were very eye-catching.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was amazing and he came in first in the a.s.sessment. Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were both beautiful and looked almost identical. It was hard not to attract attention when the three of them stood together.</p><p>Most of the people looked at Lu Ming with admiration, but some of them had a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>After all, his cultivation base had been suppressed during the a.s.sessment.</p><p>Many of them actually had very high cultivation levels, far above Lu Ming’s. They had powerful combat abilities, but they still looked down on and were hostile to Lu Ming, who had not become a G.o.d.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>A young man smiled and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Deng!”</p><p>Lu Ming also smiled.</p><p>This young man was the person who had fought against Lu Ming in the twentieth zone in the first round of the a.s.sessment, Deng Yu.</p><p>Back then, when he lost to Lu Ming, he was convinced of his defeat and had no hostility toward Lu Ming. Later on, when he saw Lu Ming coming in first in the a.s.sessment, he was even more impressed.</p><p>It was obvious that Deng Yu had also joined the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, several figures flashed and appeared.</p><p>The person in the lead was the powerhouse from the Kong Xuan sect. He had been in charge of the Kong Xuan sect’s disciple recruitment this time.</p><p>let me introduce myself. I’m Huo Quan, an outer sect elder of the Kong Xuan sect. Now, follow me, I’ll bring you to the headquarters of the Kong Xuan sect! the elder said.</p><p>Huo Quan made a brief introduction and then led Lu Ming and the rest to a teleportation array.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was one of the Qin Tian thirteen sects and was ranked first among the top ten sects. It was extremely powerful and the territory it occupied was vast.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect occupied dozens of galaxies and countless vital planets.</p><p>The headquarters of the Kong Xuan sect was called the Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>The Kong Xuan planet was a huge life planet. Around it, there were eight other huge planets.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
