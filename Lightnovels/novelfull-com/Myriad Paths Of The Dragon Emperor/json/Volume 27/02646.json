He appeared behind Lu Ming and slashed out with his sword. The sharp and terrifying sword Qi made Lu Ming’s skin tighten.</p><p>what incredible speed! It’s an incomplete speed-type divine skill!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He took a step forward and his body burst forward. Then, he whipped his long spear backward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The spear gleam swept across situ Feng’s sword aura, allowing Lu Ming to avoid situ Feng’s attack by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>“That is … It’s an incomplete speed-type divine skill!”</p><p>situ Feng has actually cultivated an incomplete speed-type divine skill. Moreover, judging from its power, it has also reached the fourth level!</p><p>terrifying, truly terrifying. This situ Feng has actually cultivated two incomplete divine skills to the fourth level in just a few years!</p><p>Many people were amazed.</p><p>Everyone knew that situ Feng had been hiding his strength.</p><p>What he cultivated was not an incomplete divine skill, but two.</p><p>A speed-type incomplete divine skill and an attack-type incomplete divine skill. The combination of the two would increase the power explosively.</p><p>Even the eyes of the big shots of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans lit up.</p><p>“In just a few years, you’ve managed to cultivate two incomplete divine skills to the 4th level. This kind of comprehension ability is not bad, not bad. I didn’t expect that there would be such a person in the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>A purple-robed elder from the indestructible sword sect, one of the three Overlord forces, stroked his beard and revealed a satisfied expression.</p><p>hahaha, Feng ‘er has actually cultivated an incomplete speed-type divine skill. Haha, that’s great. I knew he wouldn’t lose!</p><p>Situ haonan even laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>He was truly excited. Didn’t he see that even the experts from the indestructible sword sect, one of the three Overlord forces, were praising situ Feng?</p><p>It was obvious that she had taken a fancy to situ Feng.</p><p>There was a high chance that situ Feng would join the eternal sword sect, so it would be strange if he wasn’t excited.</p><p>“Kill him! Kill that brat.”</p><p>Situ haonan roared in his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re still far from being comparable to me. I’m the number one heavenly pride in the chaotic astral River!”</p><p>Situ Feng sneered and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, thirty-six sword gleams were aimed at Lu Ming’s vital points.</p><p>The combination of a speed-type incomplete divine skill and an attack-type incomplete divine skill was indeed powerful, and it increased his combat power by a large margin.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and swept it out with the momentum of sweeping away thousands of troops.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Situ Feng’s sword gleam shattered continuously, but it burst out again and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the span of a breath, situ Feng had circled Lu Ming thirty-seven times and slashed out one thousand and eighty-six sword gleams.</p><p>This was the terrifying combination of an incomplete speed-type divine skill and an incomplete attack-type divine skill.</p><p>The combination of the two completely controlled Lu Ming within a certain range. He could only be beaten up pa.s.sively.</p><p>This was because one’s speed was not as fast as the other party’s. When one’s attack was launched, the other party would have dodged it. However, it would be difficult for one to Dodge the other party’s attack.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block. Die!”</p><p>Situ Feng’s cold voice sounded, and his attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>“Situ Feng, is this your full strength? Then, let’s stop here!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke calmly.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming’s voice fell, his figure soared into the sky like a ROC spreading its wings.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming swooped down at an amazing speed. He became one with his spear and stabbed at situ Feng.</p><p>Fast, it was extremely fast.</p><p>Many people had the illusion that Lu Ming had transformed into a ROC and was hunting for prey.</p><p>it’s an incomplete speed-type divine skill, and it’s also an incomplete level four speed-type divine skill!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming had also mastered an incomplete speed-type divine skill.</p><p>Situ Feng’s eyes narrowed as he slashed his combat sword violently, clashing with Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. He shook the long spear and in an instant, eleven layers of strength burst out.</p><p>Incomplete divine skill, fifth level!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming used the fourth stage of the ROC wings technique and the fifth stage of the incomplete divine skill.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming concealed his divine power and did not use his full strength. Otherwise, he would not have needed to use so many moves.</p><p>Even so, situ Feng could not withstand it at all. The sword gleam collapsed and Lu Ming’s spear pierced through situ Feng’s head, killing him instantly.</p><p>In the next moment, situ Feng appeared on the stone platform with a look of disbelief.</p><p>the fifth level of an offensive divine skill! His offensive divine skill has reached the fifth level!</p><p>my G.o.d, it’s actually the fifth level. How is this possible? ”</p><p>“This is too scary!”</p><p>Many people could tell the level of the incomplete divine skill that Lu Ming used and exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s eyes shifted from the others to Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the first time they had seen someone cultivate an incomplete divine skill to the fifth level.</p><p>One had to know that they only had three years to cultivate an incomplete divine skill to the fifth level and another incomplete speed-type divine skill to the fourth level.</p><p>This level of talent and comprehension was too terrifying.</p><p>Many of the young men looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions. Only a few of them could remain calm.</p><p>“So what if your comprehension is high? if your Shen power level is not good, you are still not my opponent!”</p><p>Hu ya’s eyes became even colder.</p><p>how is this possible? how is this possible? ”</p><p>At this moment, situ haonan was already in a daze. He rubbed his eyes hard and couldn’t believe what he was seeing.</p><p>Just now, when situ Feng had revealed two divine skills, situ haonan had been extremely excited and had even laughed out loud, thinking that situ Feng would definitely win.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, situ Feng was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it, d.a.m.n it, how can this kid’s comprehension be so high!”</p><p>Kang Ji also gritted his teeth.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s high level of comprehension, he would definitely be valued by the Qin heavenly thirteen clans. If he was placed in an important position, the yuan Luo Palace would be finished.</p><p>“d.a.m.n it!”</p><p>Kang long roared in his heart. He felt that the heavens were unfair. Why did he not have such a high level of comprehension? Why did he have to let an ant in his heart have such a high level of comprehension?</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the experts from the Qin heavenly thirteen clans all lit up.</p><p>a speed-type divine skill at the fourth level and an attack-type divine skill at the fifth level. Not bad, not bad!</p><p>“It’s actually also from the chaotic astral River. This is really unexpected!”</p><p>“He’s a good seedling!”</p><p>……</p><p>The experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans spoke one after another. Even the experts of the three Overlord forces had expressions of interest on their faces.</p><p>To be able to receive such an evaluation from the experts of the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, the other Young heaven’s favorites were all green with envy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength is too strong. I’m afraid he’s only second to yang Chong, Hu ya, and the Golden Sage!</p><p>that’s right. Other than these few who control divine grade divine power, no one can defeat them!</p><p>I don’t know about Linghu ye’s background. He seems to be unfathomable!</p><p>Many young men were discussing and placing Lu Ming in the second tier.</p><p>The first tier consisted of yang Chong, Hu ya, and the Golden Sage.</p><p>In the second tier were Lu Ming, Linghu ye, and those who had won first place in their respective battlefields in the first round.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
