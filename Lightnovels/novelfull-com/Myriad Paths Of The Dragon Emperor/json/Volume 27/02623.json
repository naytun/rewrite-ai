The highest level they had pa.s.sed was the 45th floor, which was the same as the highest level of the first group.</p><p>Then, it was the fourth and fifth batch!</p><p>There were also top heaven’s favorites in the next two groups, but only one person pa.s.sed the 50th floor. No one could surpa.s.s situ Feng.</p><p>This made situ Feng the center of attention, and he became the number one person among the younger generation of the chaotic astral River.</p><p>As for situ haonan and the Walkabout sect, they were naturally the subject of much flattery. A group of leaders surrounded situ haonan to curry favor with him, and his face was filled with smiles.</p><p>my son, situ Feng, is such a genius. My Footloose sect will definitely rise. Once my son joins the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the righteous heaven Army will be destroyed with a flip of his hand!</p><p>Situ haonan thought to himself, and his eyes turned cold.</p><p>After the fifth batch, the selection process had ended.</p><p>Those who pa.s.sed were in high spirits, and those who didn’t were listless.</p><p>High up in the sky, the pavilion master waved her hand, and the giant PaG.o.da shrank. She then put it away.</p><p>alright, this round’s selection has ended. A total of 5050 people have pa.s.sed the selection!</p><p>At this point, the pavilion master paused for a moment and continued, ” “However, this is only the screening I set. Don’t think that just because you pa.s.sed it, you can take part in the thirteen clans” recruitment test. You still need to pa.s.s the test of the envoys from the thirteen clans. Only if the envoys think you pa.s.s will you truly pa.s.s. Do you understand?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts tightened.</p><p>It turned out that they still needed to pa.s.s the test of the thirteen clans. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be considered qualified and might not be able to take part in the test.</p><p>alright, all of you go back first. Come back here three days later. At that time, the messenger will descend and personally examine all of you!</p><p>The pavilion master then turned around and left.</p><p>In the square, the crowd also dispersed one by one.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the rest returned to the inn, they waited quietly.</p><p>Three days pa.s.sed by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Three days later, they returned to the square again. The square was still surrounded by people. However, only Lu Ming and the rest who had successfully cleared the level last time could enter the square.</p><p>Soon, all 5060 people had gathered.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Someone suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked in one direction.</p><p>There were a few people Walking in the Air from that direction.</p><p>One of them was the Yunfeng Pavilion master.</p><p>However, the cloud Peak Pavilion master was not walking in front. Instead, he was walking behind an elder in a brocade robe with a smile on his face.</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe was tall and st.u.r.dy, and he stood with his hands behind his back. He exuded a majestic aura that gave off a powerful pressure.</p><p>An expert!</p><p>This elder was definitely an extremely terrifying expert. He was even stronger than the pavilion master of Yunfeng Pavilion. Without a doubt, he was a heavenly G.o.d.</p><p>Everyone did not need to guess to know that this was the envoy sent by the Qin heaven’s thirteen factions.</p><p>“Emissary Lin, these are the heaven’s favorites that my chaotic astral River has selected!”</p><p>The cloud Peak Pavilion master stood in the air and introduced the old man to the old man with a smile.</p><p>In front of such a person, even if she was the cloud Peak Pavilion master, she did not dare to be careless.</p><p>The elder in the brocade robe swept his gaze across Lu Ming’s group of five thousand and sixty people. He frowned slightly and said,”This is your chaotic astral river’s heaven’s pride? You’re really too weak!”</p><p>The contempt in his words was self-evident.</p><p>Too weak?</p><p>Many people’s hearts tightened.</p><p>This was still too weak?</p><p>These 5,060 people could be said to be the strongest group of people in the younger generation of the chaotic astral River. However, in the eyes of the brocade-robed old man, they were too weak.</p><p>Some of the young heaven’s favorites were very confident. Now that they were being looked down upon, they felt a little indignant.</p><p>with such a standard, he still wants to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘test. Isn’t that a little laughable? ”</p><p>The brocade-robed old man added.</p><p>This time, even the cloud Peak Pavilion master was embarra.s.sed. His face turned red.</p><p>alright, I’ll cut to the chase. If you really want to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heavenly thirteen clans ‘disciple recruitment test, you’ll have to pa.s.s me!</p><p>With that, the elder in the brocade robe waved his hand, and a stone door flew out.</p><p>As soon as the stone door flew out, it grew in the wind and became a thousand feet tall. With a loud bang, it landed on the square.</p><p>as long as you can pa.s.s through this door, you’ll be considered to have pa.s.sed my test. That’s why it’ll be difficult for you to partic.i.p.ate in the Qin heaven’s thirteen clans ‘disciple recruitment test!</p><p>The brocade-robed elder said.</p><p>It was that simple?</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>As long as he could pa.s.s through this door, he would be able to pa.s.s the a.s.sessment of the elder in brocade.</p><p>It definitely wasn’t simple!</p><p>Then, many people thought this way. Their eyes flickered and many thoughts flashed through their minds.</p><p>“Who’s first!”</p><p>The brocade-robed elder asked.</p><p>However, for a moment, no one stepped forward. Everyone had the same thought. They didn’t understand the a.s.sessment of this door and wanted to wait for others to step forward and get a feel for it.</p><p>The crowd looked at each other.</p><p>“No one is going forward?”</p><p>The brocade-robed old man asked with a hint of displeasure in his eyes.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke and stepped forward.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he went early or late, so he might as well go earlier.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was very confident. He was confident that he could pa.s.s it. If he could not pa.s.s it, then probably no one else in the entire chaotic astral River could.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and came to the stone door. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on him.</p><p>it’s this kid. Hehe, he actually dares to be the first to go on stage. How stupid. I hope he doesn’t pa.s.s!</p><p>Outside the square, Kang Ji sneered.</p><p>“This brat is really stupid to Scout for others!”</p><p>In the square, Kang long sneered.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He walked at a constant speed and stepped into the stone door.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming stepped through the stone door, the door glowed and runes appeared. Then, a few beams of Crimson divine light shot towards Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. His palm was like a knife, continuously slashing out and destroying the rainbow lights. It was easy and there was no difficulty at all.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>When the elder in the brocade robe saw Lu Ming’s attack, his eyes widened in shock and confusion.</p><p>“What kind of power is that? It’s somewhat like the legendary path of a master, but how is it possible in a mere chaotic astral River?”</p><p>The brocade-robed elder muttered.</p><p>The reason why he did not recognize Lu Ming’s Dao of domination was that Lu Ming had found a way to change the Dao of domination, such as its color. Now that Lu Ming was using the Dao of domination, the color was dark purple, which was not so obvious.</p><p>As long as Lu Ming did not unleash his full power, it would not be fully revealed.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward. The stone door shone brightly, and more light burst out, bombarding Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming casually waved his palm and shattered all the divine light.</p><p>“It’s very simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took another step forward. This time, more divine lights came but they were all easily destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After this attack, there were no more attacks. Lu Ming crossed the stone door easily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
