I’ve never heard of this before!”</p><p>“Indeed, I’ve never heard of it either!”</p><p>he might be a new genius. However, he is definitely not on the same level as Golden Sage, Hu ya, and yang Chong!</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>The crowd looked at the ranking on the screen and discussed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been cultivating the incomplete divine skill in seclusion for one and a half months.</p><p>Half of the three-month period had pa.s.sed.</p><p>For one and a half months, Lu Ming had been focused on comprehending the incomplete divine skill and did not go out to hunt. Naturally, his ranking dropped rapidly.</p><p>hahaha, that Lu Ming can’t do it anymore. His points have not changed for one and a half months and his ranking has dropped to more than 5300. I knew it. He definitely can’t make it into the top 100!</p><p>that’s right. Previously, he was just lucky. I think he encountered some weaklings, which was why he managed to obtain some points. As time pa.s.ses, the weaklings will be eliminated, and those who remain will be the strong. He must be looking for an opportunity to hide and not dare to make a move!</p><p>weaklings are weaklings. They definitely won’t be able to enter the top 100!</p><p>Kang Ji and situ haonan both looked at the ancestor of technique and mocked him.</p><p>look, Feng ‘er has entered the top 100, and his ranking is still rising. He’s 92,81 …</p><p>Suddenly, situ haonan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Because at this moment, situ Feng’s ranking in the ninth region had suddenly skyrocketed.</p><p>Originally, situ Feng’s ranking had been outside of the 100th place, but it had suddenly soared all the way to the 72nd place before it stopped.</p><p>hahaha, I knew it. With Feng ‘er’s talent, he would definitely be able to enter the top 100. As expected, he must have killed an expert just now and obtained a large number of points!</p><p>Situ haonan laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>The pavilion master of Yunfeng Pavilion nodded his head.</p><p>Situ Feng had far surpa.s.sed the others in the tower Challenge test, and she had high hopes for him.</p><p>look, Xie nianqing is in the top 100. Xie nianjun is in the top 100 too!</p><p>Suddenly, an old man beside the pavilion master of the cloud Peak Pavilion shouted.</p><p>The crowd looked over and saw that Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had indeed made it into the top 100.</p><p>The “Galaxy” behind their names was naturally the chaotic astral River.</p><p>“Which force do these two belong to? He didn’t show off before, but he actually made it into the top 100!”</p><p>Someone was puzzled.</p><p>I remember that they were two beautiful women. They were sisters and seemed to be from the righteous Army!</p><p>“From the righteous Army?”</p><p>However, the three of them did not act rashly because Lu Ming was too calm. He was so calm even when facing the three of them, which made them feel a little guilty.</p><p>you didn’t run when you saw us. You’re very confident!</p><p>One of the young men said.</p><p>“You’re here to give me points, why should I escape?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Give you free points? Hehe, you’re really confident. I’m just afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>The other youth said. His divine power surged and a combat sword formed.</p><p>make your move. I’ll give you the chance to make your move!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>arrogant! Let’s kill him together!</p><p>A young man coldly shouted.</p><p>In an instant, the three young men moved. Three attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s not weak. It seems that after more than a month of fighting, those who can be left behind have some skills!</p><p>As soon as the three of them attacked, Lu Ming could tell that the three young men were not weak.</p><p>Although the divine power that the three of them controlled was only ordinary divine power, they had a deep understanding of the incomplete divine skill. They had reached the limit of the first stage and were not far from the second stage.</p><p>However, compared to Lu Ming, he was still far from having such abilities.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air and a long spear was formed. He then thrust it out.</p><p>The three spearlights were aimed at the three young men.</p><p>Each spear ray had seven variations, making it impossible to guard against.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>When the spear radiance disappeared, a hole had appeared between the three young men’s eyebrows.</p><p>“So powerful …”</p><p>This was the last thought of the three young men. Then, with a bang, their bodies turned into energy and dissipated.</p><p>my points have actually increased by 236 points!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Originally, he had 88 points. However, after killing the three young men, his points suddenly became 324 points, an increase of 236 points.</p><p>as expected, those who can stay until the end are all experts. Each of them has a lot of points. That’s great!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. His figure flashed and he went to look for his next opponent.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming discovered another young genius hiding in a house. Lu Ming attacked directly and killed the person in an instant.</p><p>His points had become 367, and he was now in the top 2000.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
