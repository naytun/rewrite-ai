He only cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture to the 12th level and his cultivation had a breakthrough.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming felt that he could use the ruler’s divine power more easily than before.</p><p>according to the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture, I’ve already reached the twelfth level. I can practice other divine techniques and light another divine fire near the original divine fire. Unfortunately, there are no other divine techniques!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. At the same time, he began to think about how to get a few divine techniques to cultivate after he returned to the sect.</p><p>There were different levels of divine techniques.</p><p>They were divided into King-grade, Saint-grade, and divine-grade wondrous techniques.</p><p>A King-grade wondrous technique could be cultivated to King-grade divine power when cultivated to its peak.</p><p>When a divine grade technique was cultivated to its peak, it could be cultivated to divine grade divine power.</p><p>As for divine-grade divine arts and wondrous techniques, one would be able to cultivate divine-grade divine power when they were cultivated to the peak.</p><p>The higher the level, the higher the value.</p><p>Each of the Qin heaven thirteen clans had a divine grade technique. However, each of them was a sect’s treasure. Only the true core figures had the right to cultivate it.</p><p>The three Overlord forces all had divine-grade divine skills.</p><p>In addition, as the head of the top ten sects, it was said that the Kong Xuan sect had several divine grade techniques.</p><p>The divine grade and divine grade techniques were too precious. Naturally, Lu Ming could not get his hands on them now. However, the king grade techniques were not so precious. It was still possible for him to get them.</p><p>At the very least, in a powerful faction like the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, there should still be quite a few King grade divine arts and wondrous techniques.</p><p>Although it was only at the king grade, if Lu Ming cultivated and ignited one more divine fire, his abilities would definitely be stronger.</p><p>The key was that the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture was too mysterious. Lu Ming did not need to cultivate other divine techniques to the peak. He only needed to cultivate a wisp of divine power. Under the drive of the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture, he would naturally be able to achieve the corresponding level of divine power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, two powerful auras emanated from Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>The two of them had broken through!</p><p>The speed of refining the wood crystals was too fast. After a few days of refining, their cultivation had directly broken through from the third level of the void G.o.d Realm to the fourth level.</p><p>Soon, the two of them calmed down.</p><p>However, there were still a lot of wood crystals left. The two of them continued to refine.</p><p>“Let’s take a look at the other two G.o.dly skills!”</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it.</p><p>He was not in a hurry to refine the wood crystal and improve his cultivation.</p><p>He had been making consecutive breakthroughs recently, so he had to stop and stabilize his cultivation. Otherwise, it was easy for his Foundation to become unstable.</p><p>He was different from Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun had merged her previous life with this life, which meant that she was reborn from her previous life. Her cultivation base was far higher than her current cultivation base. As long as she had a large amount of resources, her cultivation base could improve quickly.</p><p>Xie nianqing had devoured her past life in this life, but she still inherited all the memories of her past life. Even though her personality and her will were all from this life.</p><p>However, she had inherited the memories of her previous life. Her vision and martial will were still very high. Although they were not as good as Xie nianjun’s, they were still extraordinary. Therefore, even if she improved quickly, her realm would not be unstable.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming looked through the two divine skills in detail.</p><p>Ninefold divine skill!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The two divine skills were both ninefold divine skills, which meant that these two divine skills could be cultivated to the ninth fold!</p><p>Ninefold divine skills were extremely rare and precious. The more one cultivated, the more powerful they would be.</p><p>People like the ancestor of technique, Kang Ji, and situ haonan only had one triple divine skill.</p><p>This was a complete G.o.dly skill, not an incomplete G.o.dly skill. It was much more powerful.</p><p>The nine stage Crimson Gold armor was a defensive divine skill. After successfully cultivating it, a Crimson Gold battle armor would form on the surface of one’s body, and its defensive power would be shocking.</p><p>The higher the cultivation, the stronger the defense and even the powerful rebound force.</p><p>If it was cultivated to the ninth level, its power would be unimaginable.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes,” an attack-type divine skill, with a total of three moves!</p><p>Break the sky, slash the moon, and explode the stars!</p><p>Of the three forms, each was stronger than the previous, but also more difficult to master.</p><p>At the first stage, one could use the ‘s.p.a.ce-piercing’.</p><p>Only after cultivating it to the fourth level would he be able to unleash the power of moon splitting.</p><p>As for the supernova, he could only use it after he had cultivated it to the seventh level.</p><p>“Can I cultivate now?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>Theoretically, one had to be at least at peak void G.o.d Realm to be able to use the full power of the skill.</p><p>This was because using a divine skill consumed an astonishing amount of divine power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming controlled a G.o.d’s divine power. It could not be compared to other divine powers. It was very strong and might be able to exert some power.</p><p>since I can’t raise my cultivation now, I’ll just cultivate for a while!</p><p>Lu Ming made his decision and started to study the ” three apocalyptic strikes “.</p><p>There was no doubt that the divine skill was very mysterious. Fortunately, Lu Ming had previously cultivated an incomplete divine skill and had cultivated it to a very high level. It would be easier for him.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming spent a full half a month before he finally learned the basics of the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes was a simple attack technique that could be used with many weapons, such as swords, sabers, Spears, axes, and so on.</p><p>Lu Ming took out his long spear and quickly circulated his divine power. His entire person became sharp.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear suddenly thrust forward. A spear light pierced through his body and blasted toward the stone wall on one side of the abyss.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Like a long spear piercing into tofu, a small hole appeared in the stone wall, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.</p><p>“What a powerful might …”</p><p>Lu Ming was pleasantly surprised. However, he pulled a long face immediately because he felt that the divine energy in his body was almost exhausted.</p><p>Using a divine skill really consumed too much divine power.</p><p>Although he controlled ruler’s divine power, he was only at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm. It was still too difficult for him to use a divine skill.</p><p>If other people did not control divine-grade divine power and their cultivation was only at the second level of the void G.o.d Realm, they would not be able to use divine skills at all.</p><p>“Let’s recover first!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to the side and took out some divine crystals. He started to absorb the divine Qi from the divine crystals to recover his divine energy.</p><p>Just as he recovered a little, Lu Ming felt Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s auras expand.</p><p>He was about to break through again!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In the past half a month, Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had refined most of the wood crystals that were given to them. They finally began to break through again.</p><p>Soon, they successfully broke through, and their auras stabilized.</p><p>Fifth level void G.o.d Realm!</p><p>Such a breakthrough speed was truly shocking. How long had it been since they arrived in this forest?</p><p>“This forest is really a blessing!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>This was a benefit for the new disciples. As long as they had the strength and could get enough wood crystals, their strength would soar in a short time.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to consume divine crystals. Soon, his divine power was restored to its peak.</p><p>“Now, let’s go up!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said as he walked over.</p><p>“I also have the same intention!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
