Then I can’t let little Qing go alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry. I’ll be very safe when I go to that place!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming, let me tell you, if Xie nianqing stays by your side, he will be in real danger. It’s easy for the enemy to sense him. When that happens, not only will Xie nianqing be in danger, but you, Lu shenhuang, Lu Chi, and your family will all be in danger!</p><p>Xie nianjun said.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming was speechless. He understood that Xie nianqing had left most likely for their safety.</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of himself, but he had to consider for Lu shenhuang and the rest.</p><p>“Strength, it’s still strength …”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>After coming to the desolate universe, he deeply felt that he was too weak.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t worry. Our separation is only temporary. We’ll meet again sooner or later!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said as he held Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent and did not speak.</p><p>At this time, the s.p.a.ce flickered, and the gray-robed elder’s figure reappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is for you!”</p><p>The gray-robed elder waved his hand and a jade talisman flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and took it.</p><p>the address we’re going to is inside, but I’ve placed a seal on it. One day, when your cultivation surpa.s.ses that of a G.o.dking, you’ll be able to break the seal. At that time, you can partic.i.p.ate in everything!</p><p>The gray-robed elder said.</p><p>“Surpa.s.sing the G.o.dking level!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>Lu Ming had never heard of the realm above the king of G.o.ds.</p><p>According to what he knew, the strongest experts in the Qin heaven Starfield were G.o.dkings. He had never heard of an existence that transcended G.o.dking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take care. We will meet again very soon. I believe in you!”</p><p>Xie nianqing spoke softly, then pressed his red lips against Lu Ming’s. After a long time, their lips parted.</p><p>“Little Qing, don’t worry. It won’t take me too long to reach the G.o.d King realm. I’ll definitely reach that realm. When that time comes, I’ll come and find you!”</p><p>Lu Ming whispered in Xie nianqing’s ear. His voice was firm, and so was his gaze.</p><p>He had seen all kinds of storms along the way.</p><p>In the heaven realm, even someone as powerful as the evil G.o.d tribe had been annihilated by him in the end.</p><p>Since Xie nianqing had a great enemy in his previous life and they were destined to fight, he would flatten him and erase him from the face of time.</p><p>“I believe in you, Lu Ming. Take care!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered as he retreated.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the grey-robed elder swept up Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun with a force and they disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Little Qing, wait for me!”</p><p>Looking at the empty courtyard, a low and deep voice reverberated in the courtyard.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming took a deep breath to calm himself down. He then returned to his room to cultivate.</p><p>He would definitely use the shortest amount of time to reach the G.o.d King realm.</p><p>No matter how strong the opponent was, he would flatten them.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun’s departure did not cause any commotion in Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>There were many disciples in the Kong Xuan sect. Every year, some disciples would go missing, be killed, or die while completing missions, or die in dangerous places. To the major forces, this was a very normal thing.</p><p>However, the G.o.d King experts of the Kong Xuan sect did not sense the arrival of the gray-robed elder on planet Kong Xuan. This made Lu Ming understand that the cultivation of the gray-robed elder was impossible to guess.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had pa.s.sed since Xie nianqing left.</p><p>On this day, a group of people arrived at the Huangwu courtyard.</p><p>“Big brother, you’ve finally come out of seclusion!”</p><p>Huang Wu was standing in front of a white-robed young man, his face full of smiles.</p><p>The white-robed young man had a cold expression on his face. He was Huang Wu’s elder brother, Huang Wen.</p><p>“I know everything about you!”</p><p>Huang Wen said, his voice revealing a hint of killing intent.</p><p>“Big brother, you have to avenge me. That Lu Ming, that b * stard, dared to injure me and kill the people of my floating light Faction. I’ll tear him into a thousand pieces!”</p><p>Huang Wu’s face was ferocious.</p><p>he’s dead. He’s definitely dead. However, it’s not easy to deal with him if he stays in the sect!</p><p>Huang Wen frowned.</p><p>There was a rule in the Kong Xuan sect that killing was not allowed within the sect.</p><p>“Then what should we do? Are we just going to let him be?”</p><p>Huang Wu said unwillingly.</p><p>“Carefree, how is that possible?”</p><p>hehe! Huang Wen sneered. Dongfang han, go and issue a life-and-death duel invitation to that brat. Force him out of the mountain Gate, and then we’ll go and kill him!</p><p>“Let Dongfang han write a life-and-death duel? How was this possible? That kid isn’t stupid, how could he agree?”</p><p>Huang Wu said.</p><p>Killing was forbidden in the Kong Xuan sect, but there was one exception.</p><p>That was the life-and-death duel.</p><p>However, there were also conditions to issuing the Deathmatch challenge. The two outer sect elders had to sign it, and both parties had to agree to the challenge. Only after they stamped their thumbprints would the Deathmatch challenge take effect.</p><p>This way, they could enter the life-and-death battle stage and fight to the death, and the sect would not pursue the matter.</p><p>However, Dongfang Hao was an expert on the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>Almost all of the outer sect disciples were at the void G.o.d Realm, and there were close to 100000 of them.</p><p>Therefore, someone had created a ranking list, which was the virtual G.o.d ranking list.</p><p>He listed the 120 strongest virtual G.o.d-level powerhouses and made a ranking.</p><p>Everyone who made it onto the virtual G.o.d ranking was an expert at the peak of the ninth level of the virtual G.o.d Realm. Their combat strength was extremely powerful and even surpa.s.sed people of the same level.</p><p>One had to know that there were more than 120 people who had reached the ninth level of the void G.o.d Realm in the outer sect of the Kong Xuan sect. There were even more than 10000 people.</p><p>Many of them had reached the ninth level of ethereal G.o.d Realm and then got stuck at this realm, unable to advance further.</p><p>Out of so many people, only 120 were listed. It could be seen how strong these 120 people were.</p><p>Although Dongfang Hao was ranked 120th at the bottom of the virtual G.o.d ranking list, his combat strength far surpa.s.sed other ninth-level virtual G.o.d Realm experts.</p><p>Sending such an expert to issue a death duel invitation to Lu Ming, it would be a wonder if Lu Ming would sign it.</p><p>of course, I know that he doesn’t dare to sign it. My purpose is to put pressure on him and force him to leave the mountain Gate. Then, I can crush him as easily as crushing an ant!</p><p>Huang Wen sneered.</p><p>“Big brother is wise!”</p><p>Huang Wu was overjoyed.</p><p>Next, a young man with short red hair left the place. He was Dongfang Hao, one of the top outer sect disciples.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when a voice came from outside the courtyard.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>His voice was like thunder, shaking the entire courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. He ended his cultivation and went to the courtyard.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding outer sect disciples were also alarmed.</p><p>“Someone is finding trouble with Lu Ming again!”</p><p>“That is … That’s Dongfang Hao!”</p><p>what? it’s Dongfang Hao from the virtual G.o.d ranking! He’s the top expert in the outer sect of the transient light Faction! Lu Ming is in trouble!</p><p>Many people recognized Dongfang Hao and were shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
