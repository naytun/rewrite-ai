They walked over and sat down at Long Chen’s table.</p><p>“You guys are here!”</p><p>Long Chen nodded and poured tea for Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and discovered that Long Chen’s aura was also extremely powerful. It was obvious that Long Chen had also made a breakthrough and entered the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>The few of them chatted and drank tea.</p><p>Outside, more and more people arrived. Before long, there were already hundreds of people in this area. They were all heaven’s favorites of the younger generation. Almost all of the heaven’s favorites from the ancient Moon Holy Land had been invited.</p><p>…..</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you’ve finally stopped being a tortoise and come out!”</p><p>At this moment, a sneer reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the voice and saw a few young people looking at him with cold eyes.</p><p>The WAN clan’s prodigy!</p><p>Among them were Wan tianbing, Wan Tianlong, and another person who exuded an air of nobility. Lu Ming did not recognize him, but it was clearly another prodigy of the WAN family.</p><p>It was Wan tianbing who had just spoken.</p><p>At the scene, many paragons looked at Lu Ming and then at the WAN clan’s Paragon with anticipation.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming was going to clash with the WAN family again.</p><p>“Wan tianbing, what? You didn’t feel good after the last battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>Wan tianbing’s face darkened, and he snorted coldly,” “Last time, 1 was just careless. You don’t need to be proud!”</p><p>“Careless? What a joke. If it wasn’t for you, the old dog of the WAN family, shamelessly interfering last time, you would have already died!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in disdain.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a young man beside Wan tianbing slammed the table. His eyes were as cold as lightning as he looked at Lu Ming and berated, impudent! How dare you insult the WAN family’s seniors! You deserve to die ten thousand times!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the person and said indifferently,” “Who the hell are you? Was 1 wrong to call those old men of the WAN family old dogs? After hitting the young, the old will make a move, it was obvious to all!”</p><p>“You still dare to talk nonsense, I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>you’re courting death! the man shouted coldly. He stood up suddenly and his powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The great saint realm!</p><p>Without a doubt, this man was a Supreme Saint, much stronger than Wan tianbing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, Long Chen and Feng Ling burst out with a powerful aura at the same time, dispersing the man’s aura in one go, causing the man’s expression to change.</p><p>He was not the only one. The others ‘expressions also changed drastically as they looked at Feng Ling and Long Chen in disbelief.</p><p>Supreme Saint, Feng Ling and Long Chen have also broken through to the Supreme Saint realm. How is that possible?”</p><p>a few months ago, they were still far from the great saint realm. How did they break through to the great saint realm so quickly? it’s incredible!</p><p>Many people exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>In particular, some of the geniuses who had competed with Feng Ling and Long Chen in the past were even paler.</p><p>For example, Huang Kong, Huang Bing, and the others of the Phoenix Palace looked at Feng Ling, tongue-tied.</p><p>In the end, they sighed. They knew that they had been far surpassed by Huang Ling. Coupled with Huang Ling’s terrifying talent, they would never be able to surpass her in their lifetime.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert of the WAN family was called Wan Pingyang. He was one of the strongest heaven’s pride experts of the WAN family. He had just returned from the heaven Empyrean city. His expression changed. He did not expect Long Chen and Feng Ling to be so powerful.</p><p>Wan Pingyang rolled his eyes and sneered,” Lu Ming, you’re really a coward. When I went to the Phoenix Palace to challenge you, you hid and refused to fight. Now, you’re hiding behind someone else. Hehe, this is the first time I’ve seen martial arts rely on hiding!</p><p>you’re a great saint, yet you want to fight a bright Saint like me. Do you think it’s a glorious thing? is this your confidence and pride?”</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. Cultivation is also a type of talent. No matter how strong you are, if you are forever stuck at a cultivation level, you will still be a piece of trash. 1 can suppress you with a flip of my hand?”</p><p>Wan Pingyang laughed and mocked.</p><p>“You’re really that confident? You can suppress me? If a Supreme Saint is suppressed by a sacred light like me, I wonder if the elders of the WAN family will come and find trouble with me again?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“It’s ridiculous to be suppressed by you. Do you think that’s possible? Come out and fight!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang shouted.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. A cold glint flashed in his eyes and he was about to stand up.</p><p>At this moment, a clear voice sounded,” everyone, we’re here to taste tea today and get to know each other. There’s no need to use force. The Holy successor is about to arrive!</p><p>At this moment, a Holy maiden of the Jade Lake spoke.</p><p>“Hmph! Lu Ming, you’re lucky. I’ll give the Jade Lake Saint some face today. But your luck won’t last forever!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang said coldly.</p><p>“Luck?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly.</p><p>Who was the lucky one?</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>At this moment, someone spoke, and everyone’s eyes turned to the pavilion.</p><p>A woman stepped out from the depths of the Jade Lake divine Palace. Her figure was the most beautiful piece of art in the world. She was well-proportioned and beautiful, making people unable to move their eyes away.</p><p>With every step she took, a cloud would appear in the sky and drag her body.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes moved up and saw a peerless face that could topple cities.</p><p>The nine Jade Lake saintesses were already peerless beauties, but they paled in comparison to this woman.</p><p>This woman was like a fairy that had walked out of a painting, the goddess of legends.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful!”</p><p>Someone mumbled to himself. He was already dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was also dumbfounded.</p><p>Not only him, even Huang Ling and Long Chen were stunned.</p><p>It wasn’t because she was too beautiful, but because they knew her.</p><p>“Luo Tianyi!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. He had never expected that the Jade pool’s Holy successor would be Luo Tianyi, one of the seven people who had passed the Hunyuan sect’s assessment and obtained the silver inheritor.</p><p>I didn’t expect that she would be the Holy successor of the Jade Lake!</p><p>Huang Ling muttered to herself.</p><p>“I really didn’t expect it!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>brother Lu Ming is really perverted. He is in a daze when he sees a beautiful woman!</p><p>At the side, Pao Pao muttered.</p><p>“Cough cough!”</p><p>Lu Ming coughed a few times in embarrassment, his face blushing slightly. He picked up a cup of tea and took a sip. He glanced at bubbles and said,” “What does a little brat know?”</p><p>of course 1 know. You think I can’t tell from your eyes? and brother Long Chen too, and Sister Feng Ling…</p><p>Bubbles pouted her chubby little mouth, a trace of disdain flashing in her eyes, which made Long Chen and Feng Ling a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Little girl, you’re talking nonsense. I’m a woman, how could I…?”</p><p>Huang Ling rolled her eyes at bubbles.</p><p>…..</p><p>“Can’t a woman do that?” Paoba muttered.</p><p>At this time, Luo Tianyi had already landed on the pavilion. She picked up a cup of tea and said,” I’m Luo Tianyi. Thank you for coming. 1 don’t have any wine today, only tea. I’ll drink tea in place of wine. Here’s a toast to you all!</p><p>Then, he picked up the teacup and took a sip..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
