However, twenty years later, Lu Ming was confident that he would not be weaker than anyone of his generation.</p><p>...</p><p>If he didn’t even have this bit of confidence, how could he reach the peak?</p><p>This was the same as the child of death and the others. All peerless geniuses were full of confidence in themselves and believed that they could suppress everyone.</p><p>“Alright, I hope you can suppress everyone!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“Senior, is there any more benefits?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the white-robed old man eagerly.</p><p>…..</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled and a Jade token appeared in his hand. He said,” this is a list of all the Hunyuan sect inheritors. Since ancient times, there have been quite a number of them. They are bronze and silver inheritors. They have all sworn to take orders from higher-ranked inheritors. Take a look!</p><p>The white-robed elder passed the Jade token to Lu Ming. Lu Ming took it and sank his spiritual sense into it. He immediately saw more than two hundred names.</p><p>senior, over the course of countless years, only 200 or so people have become inheritors? N</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised. There were seven of them this time.</p><p>“You think it’s easy to become an inheritor? The reason why there are so many of you is because we’re in a Golden Age where all the elites are gathered. That’s why there are seven inheritors at once. In the past, there might not have been a single inheritor for many years!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>but let me tell you, some of these people here died in battle before they could grow up. Some of them became unparalleled experts and established terrifying forces. Many of them even became Emperor level experts.</p><p>however, the stronger your cultivation is, the stronger your ability to resist the oath. If you go to them now, those powerful existences may not listen to you and may even kill you. You’d better know what to do!</p><p>The white-robed old man warned.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>For an existence that didn’t listen to him, so what if they were strong? this name list was as good as nothing. It was useless.</p><p>of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that there are people who are loyal to the Hunyuan sect and will take orders from the high-level inheritors. You have to be sure of this!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming was so depressed that he was about to vomit blood. He suddenly felt that the white-robed elder was asking for a beating.</p><p>Confidence? how?</p><p>How would he know which people were loyal to Hunyuan sect? if he rashly ran over and said that he was the Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritor, he would probably be slapped to death by those powerful existences.</p><p>The longer the time, the weaker the binding of the oath. The stronger the cultivation, the weaker the binding of the oath. Some peerless powerhouses had the power to destroy the world and even transcended oaths. Any oath was useless.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual senses suddenly scanned a name.</p><p>Sakra!</p><p>Di? What did it have to do with the DI family?</p><p>“Senior, who is this sakra? Do you have any news about him?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m not very clear about the current situation of the people above, but this sakra is definitely still alive, and his cultivation is very profound. You have the Golden inheritance token, so if you approach a low-level inheritance token in the future, you will be able to sense it!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. If this sakra was really an expert of the DI family, would he listen to his orders?</p><p>It was probably very mysterious.</p><p>“Senior, this name list isn’t of much use. Is there any other reward for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to stare at the white-robed old man.</p><p>your cultivation is still low. There are some powerful inheritances that you can only cultivate after you reach the Emperor-rank! The white-robed elder said helplessly.</p><p>no way, is there any sacred art related to the array Dao laws?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>His array Dao laws could not be used without the combination of a sacred art.</p><p>“Array Dao laws? I have one of the nine scrolls of the Dao of arrays, the sealed scroll. I’ll give it to you!”</p><p>The white-robed old man thought for a moment, and a Jade token appeared in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He quickly took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He immediately saw a bunch of wonderful content.</p><p>the nine scrolls of array Dao is the highest technique to cultivate the array Dao laws. It seizes the good fortune of heaven and earth and was created by a powerful existence. However, I only have one of the nine scrolls here. You’ll have to find the rest on your own!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart and kept it. He looked at the white-robed elder and said,”Senior, are there any other rewards, such as secret techniques or the like?”</p><p>The white-robed old man’s eyelids kept twitching. This kid was too greedy.</p><p>I have a secret technique here called the divine breath technique. It can change and hide one’s aura. With your current cultivation, even an ordinary minor Emperor expert won’t be able to see through it if they don’t look carefully!</p><p>After the white-robed old man finished speaking, a Jade token appeared in his hand.</p><p>“He can even hide from a little emperor? It’s even more powerful than the illusionary breath technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, then overjoyed.</p><p>“Illusionary breath technique? That’s just a simplified version of the divine breath technique!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!” Lu Ming received it with great joy.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll send you to meet the others!”</p><p>As if he was afraid that Lu Ming would speak again, the white-robed elder did not give him a chance to speak. He waved his hand and left with Lu Ming. In the next moment, Lu Ming appeared in another Hall.</p><p>This Hall was the hall where Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others were.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming appeared, the six of them looked over at the same time.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming, Huang Ling’s face lit up and she hurried over.</p><p>haha, we shouldn’t call each other by name now. We should call each other young sect master!</p><p>Long Chen said with a smile.</p><p>Lu Ming was a golden inheritor and would inherit the position of Hunyuan sect’s sect master in the future. They should address him as young sect master.</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, we re friends. There’s no need to be so formal. Just like before!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Long Chen and Feng Ling nodded with a smile. They understood Lu Ming’s character.</p><p>“Luo Tianyi greets the young sect master!”</p><p>A peerless woman walked over gracefully and bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young lady, please rise, no need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the other three.</p><p>The child of death and the two young men all had ugly expressions.</p><p>They could not bow to Lu Ming.</p><p>Their cultivation was higher than Lu Ming’s. They could not get over this.</p><p>“I know that you are not convinced and even look down on me. It doesn’t matter. If it is not necessary, I will not order you around. Similarly, in twenty years, I will give you the opportunity to challenge me. If you can defeat me, I will respect him as the young sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>…..</p><p>you won’t be a match for me in 20 years. The position of the gold inheritor is destined to be mine!</p><p>The child of death spoke in an extremely domineering manner.</p><p>I’ll wait for your challenge, but I’ll be the young sect master for the next twenty years!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The child of death’s expression changed, but in the end, his eyes revealed a determined look. He cupped his fists and said,” “Young sect master!”</p><p>Then, he stepped aside.</p><p>The other two people pondered for a moment and bowed to Lu Ming as well..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
