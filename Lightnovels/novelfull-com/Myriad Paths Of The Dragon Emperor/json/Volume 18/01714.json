His body moved and he charged towards Lu Ming. With a wave of his hand, a stream of toxic gas formed into the shape of a long spear and shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and the Black Dragon Spear appeared. He thrust the spear forward and the Spear’s radiance was dazzling. It shattered the long spear formed by the opponent’s poisonous gas. However, after the poisonous gas dispersed, a dense swarm of poisonous insects appeared and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The Black Dragon Spear swept out and expanded to a hundred thousand feet. The terrifying power crushed down and all the poisonous insects were turned into ashes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and closed in on the thin middle-aged man in an instant. His long spear was thrust out like lightning. It was so fast that it was beyond the reaction of the naked eye.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; the thin middle-aged man’s body was pierced by the spear and his body exploded. However, after he exploded, he turned into a ball of poison gas and rolled around.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength is very strong, but I also have a superior-grade earth spiritual body. It’s useless Against Me!”</p><p>The thin middle-aged man’s cold voice came from the poisonous gas.</p><p>There was no doubt that this thin middle-aged man was a heaven’s favorite when he was young. His spirit body was of a very high level.</p><p>In fact, those who could break through to the sage realm were very talented when they were young. Their spirit bodies were not low.</p><p>It was usually difficult for ordinary spirit bodies to break through to the Saint realm unless they had a heaven-defying opportunity.</p><p>Those who could break through to the Saint realm usually had an earth spiritual body or above. Of course, the higher the level of the spiritual body, the higher the chance of breaking through.</p><p>“Thousand poison exterminate!”</p><p>The thin middle-aged man’s voice rang out. Endless poisonous gas rolled and surged towards Lu Ming. A foul smell rushed into Lu Ming’s nose.</p><p>This poisonous gas contained the law of poison and was extremely terrifying. Just a wisp of it could poison thousands of living beings to death.</p><p>“It’s not like I haven’t killed anyone with a mere poisonous body!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. A huge chaos sky-turning seal appeared in his hand.</p><p>This chaos Empyrean seal was as large as a mountain, and it pressed down on the endless poisonous gas.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the Saint realm, his Saint energy was surging and he could cast the chaos sky-turning seal at will.</p><p>Before the breakthrough, if Lu Ming used the chaos sky-turning seal with all his might, he would run out of essential core if he used it too much. However, this problem did not exist now.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaotic sky-turning seal pressed down, and the poison kept rolling. The chaotic laws were constantly wiping out the other party’s poisonous gas.</p><p>“Ah, what happened? You should die!”</p><p>The other party panicked. The poison kept rolling and he wanted to escape, but he had been completely locked on by the chaos sky-turning seal. How could he escape?</p><p>The terrifying power was constantly obliterating the other party.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>The other party panicked and shouted in fear, but it was useless. The poisonous gas was getting less and less. After the last scream, all the poisonous gas had been wiped out.</p><p>The thin middle-aged man vanished into thin air.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The desire poison sect’s sect master snorted coldly, his expression unsightly.</p><p>“This kid’s battle strength is indeed shocking!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect said with a dark expression.</p><p>He had just broken through to the Saint realm, but he was already able to kill a peak bright Saint. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“Who wants to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the people from the three major sects.</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>In the Tian Yu demon sect, a black-robed elder stepped out. With every step he took, his aura grew stronger. When he was in front of Lu Ming, his aura was overwhelming and overbearing.</p><p>Great circle of bright Saint!</p><p>The elder had already reached the great circle of the bright Saint realm, standing at the limit of the bright Saint realm. The next step would be the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>And needless to say, the other party’s spiritual body was definitely a superior earth spiritual body.</p><p>Since he was going to fight, he was definitely very strong among his peers.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze fell on Lu Ming and the elder of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>This was a perfected bright Saint. His combat strength was several times stronger than a peak bright Saint. Was Lu Ming a match for him?</p><p>Lu Ming was only an initial bright Saint. Could he cross so many realms and fight a perfected bright Saint?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The elder from the Tian Yu demonic sect was filled with demonic Qi. A demonic blade appeared in his hand.</p><p>“Demonic blade six kills!”</p><p>The terrifying demonic blade burst out, crossing the space and slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the Black Dragon Spear and swept it across. A huge spear light collided with the demonic blade.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled as the spear and blade auras both collapsed.</p><p>However, the demonic blade in the hands of the elder from the Tian Yu demonic sect slashed out again. This time, he slashed six times in a row. Each slash turned into a huge demonic god that was 10000 feet tall and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming put away his Black Dragon Spear and cast the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, chaos Empyrean seals formed in the sky one after another. A total of six chaos Empyrean seals were formed, and they suppressed the six demon gods.</p><p>The demonic god let out a long roar, and a terrifying pressure filled the sky. It was as if the real demonic god had descended to the world and wanted to slaughter all life. The demonic God’s fists continued to blast the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The demonic energy was shocking. The demonic fist blasted on the chaos Empyrean seal, and it sounded like a world-ending drum.</p><p>In the end, the chaos sky-turning seal exploded, but the six demon gods also fell apart.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Laws of Chaos circulated around Lu Ming’s body. Like a stream of light, he charged toward the elder of the Tian Yu demon sect. Two sword gleams shot out of his eyes and rushed into the elder’s body.</p><p>arghh! the old man from the Tian Yu demon sect let out a blood-curdling screech. His eyes almost popped out of their sockets, and his aura was in chaos.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming instantly appeared beside the elder from the sky demon sect. He struck out with his palm, breaking through his layers of defense and grabbing his throat.</p><p>Everyone gasped in disbelief.</p><p>It was unbelievable that Lu Ming could defeat a perfected bright Saint so easily.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>He was only an initial bright Saint, yet he could easily defeat a great circle bright Saint.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were as cold as a blade as he looked at the sect master of the sky demon sect. I’ve been tolerating the Tian Yu demonic sect, but you’ve pushed me too far. Today, I’ll kill you!</p><p>As soon as he said the word ” kill “, a terrifying force exploded. The body of the elder from the Tian Yu demon sect was torn apart. At the same time, his soul was destroyed. A Saint heart fell into Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>From now on, he would no longer tolerate the sky demon sect!</p><p>The sky universe sect master’s eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>The sect Masters of the heaven deity sect and the desire poison sect were the same.</p><p>The three great sects were silent.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley was also quiet.</p><p>At such a young age, Lu Ming was already able to kill a great circle bright Saint like an invincible God of War.</p><p>Was this really a realm and achievement that could be achieved by relying on Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures?</p><p>Even when Emperor Cang was young, he was far from being this strong, right?</p><p>“I’m afraid that other than Emperor Cang’s treasure, this kid has an even greater opportunity!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect spoke coldly and transmitted a message to the two sect Masters of the heaven God sect and the Yu Du sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
