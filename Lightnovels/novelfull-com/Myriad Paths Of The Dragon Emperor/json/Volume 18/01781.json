It was a treasure of the world, born before the creation of the world. It was extremely precious and mysterious.</p><p>As for the primordial chaos laws, they were also one of the ten ultimate laws.</p><p>Just as the white-robed elder had said, when one broke through to the Emperor realm and condensed a small world, they would refine a wisp of nebulous primordial chaos. The small world would become more stable and powerful, far beyond ordinary small worlds.</p><p>This was a priceless treasure that was hard to come by.</p><p>…..</p><p>Their hearts were burning with passion.</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled, of course, silver inheritors will not only receive these rewards. However, you are now in the sage realm. In the sage realm, you can only cultivate one type of law. You have magical powers now and do not need other inheritances. However, when you cultivate to the Emperor-level, you can master many types of laws. The laws will merge and change endlessly. At that time, you will need a stronger inheritance. Therefore, after you reach the Emperor-level, you will have a chance to come here to obtain the inheritance!</p><p>furthermore, as silver inheritors, I’ll give you silver inheritances tokens. In the future, you can mobilize a portion of the Hunyuan sect’s strength. Inheritors who are lower than you will have to listen to your orders!</p><p>The white-robed old man’s words of temptation made the eyes of Huang Ling and the other five light up.</p><p>“Senior, what conditions do we need to agree to?”</p><p>A peerless woman among the six asked.</p><p>This woman was as beautiful as a fairy, and her every move was filled with endless temptation.</p><p>the conditions are very simple. You are silver inheritors, so of course you have to listen to gold inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled.</p><p>someone has obtained a gold-level inheritor?”</p><p>One of the young men said in disbelief.</p><p>This person was the child of death, who controlled the law of death.</p><p>that’s right. After countless years, one of them has become a golden inheritor!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Instantly, the six people’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites and they were proud. They wanted to step on other heaven’s favorites and reach the peak.</p><p>Now, they were told to listen to other heaven’s favorites. How could they accept this?</p><p>Especially the child of death. He was the Son of God and was destined to become a peak expert in the future. How could he listen to others?</p><p>“Senior, so What if I don’t obey?”</p><p>The child of death asked.</p><p>if you don’t listen to me, I’ll send you out and disqualify you as silver inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>This made the six people’s faces very ugly.</p><p>He was even more unwilling to let the opportunity that he had obtained fly away just like that.</p><p>furthermore, I’m not asking you to make a verbal promise. I want you to make a blood oath to obey the Golden inheritor!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Senior, it’s not impossible for us to obey the Golden inheritor, but if he makes some excessive or impossible requests just because he’s the Golden inheritor, do we have to obey Him?”</p><p>The peerless beauty asked.</p><p>it’s very simple. When you make the blood oath, you can add some conditions. If the other party’s order goes against the conditions you add, you naturally don’t have to listen to it. You won’t break the oath and be affected by the blood oath!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>The six people’s eyes flickered. Even so, they were unwilling.</p><p>The white-robed old man’s gaze shifted and he said,” of course, I’ll also give you a chance. You have twenty years. After that, you can challenge the Golden inheritors. Whoever wins can replace them and become the new golden inheritors!</p><p>“Twenty years!”</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the six people lit up.</p><p>To them, 20 years had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The child of death was especially confident in himself. He could defeat anyone in the same generation.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>The child of death was the first to speak.</p><p>Senior, can you let us see what the Golden inheritor looks like first?”</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling spoke, and there was a strange look in her eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming did not come here. With Lu Ming’s talent, could he not become an inheritor?</p><p>She was very curious!</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled. With a wave of his hand, a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The eyes of Huang Ling and Long Chen lit up.</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>The child of death’s eyes shone with a shocking light.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>it’s indeed him. His talent is terrifying!</p><p>The other young man said.</p><p>When they crossed the abyss previously, Lu Ming had come in first. Later on, he had even defeated the chaotic body. They had long since remembered him.</p><p>“Senior, I agree!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“I also agree!” Long Chen chimed in.</p><p>This way, three people agreed.</p><p>“I’ll agree even if I have one!” The peerless woman smiled. She was extremely charming and charming. The child of death and the others couldn’t help but take a few more glances.</p><p>Then, the last two people also agreed.</p><p>“Alright, you can take the blood oath!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Immediately, everyone made a blood oath. Of course, they added some conditions to the blood oath. They could accept normal orders, but they didn’t have to listen to special orders.</p><p>alright, I’ll now bestow you with the silver inheritance token. Also, I’ll seal the nebulous primordial chaos in the token!</p><p>The white-robed old man waved his hand, and six silver-white tokens appeared in the sky. The words ‘primordial chaos’ were written on them.</p><p>Following that, the white-robed elder sealed the six nebulous primordial chaos into the silver tokens. The six silver tokens flew towards the six of them and they received them, solemnly putting them away.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s Hall, three wisps of primordial Qi appeared in the hands of the white-robed elder.</p><p>an ordinary silver inheritor only has one wisp of the land of primordial chaos. A gold inheritor only has three wisps!</p><p>The white-robed elder said. He then took out a golden token and sealed the three wisps of primordial Qi into it. The token flew towards Lu Ming, who caught it and kept it in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>as the only golden inheritor, that’s all I get?“</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the white-robed old man eagerly.</p><p>that’s not all. The other six silver inheritors have to listen to you!</p><p>…..</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Other than Long Chen and Feng Ling, the other six were good friends with him. Naturally, there was no issue of ordering them around.</p><p>However, the other four were all extremely powerful geniuses. They definitely came from powerful forces. If Lu Ming listened to them, it would definitely be very beneficial to him.</p><p>Furthermore, when these people grew up in the future, they would definitely be rare experts and would become Lu Ming’s helpers.</p><p>of course, there’s a condition. They can challenge you in 20 years. If you lose, they will replace you as the new golden inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“Twenty years later? They can’t be my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, full of confidence..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
