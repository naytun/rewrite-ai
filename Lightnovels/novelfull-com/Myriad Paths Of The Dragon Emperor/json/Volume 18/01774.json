The walls were made of stone. Other than a bed and a table, there was nothing else in the room. It was very simple.</p><p>...</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>He remembered that he was undergoing an assessment in the Hunyuan sect. In the end, he had passed through a light door and lost consciousness. Why was he here after he woke up?</p><p>Could this be the last test? But what was the test about?</p><p>Lu Ming sized himself up. He was even more speechless when he saw that he was covered in bandages.</p><p>He was sure that he was injured, and it was a very serious injury. All the bones in his body were broken, and his muscles were also seriously injured. Waves of sharp pain were constantly coming from him.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming realized that there was not a single trace of holy power in his body. He could not lift it, let alone control the laws.</p><p>He was now just an ordinary person who was seriously injured.</p><p>“Is this really the last test?”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>At this moment, footsteps were heard and a few people walked in.</p><p>It was a burly middle-aged man. His exposed arms were thick and covered in scars. Beside the man was a middle-aged woman.</p><p>Behind the two of them was the cute girl from before.</p><p>little brother, you’re finally awake. You’ve been unconscious for three days and three nights!</p><p>The middle-aged man said in a deep voice.</p><p>three days and three nights? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more puzzled. Why did he not have any impression of it?</p><p>“Big brother, what happened to me? How could he be so heavily injured?”</p><p>Since he wasn’t clear, he might be able to find some clues if he clarified the matter.</p><p>“My father was hunting in the beast God mountain range and found you. You were already unconscious at that time. You must have been attacked by a beast. You are really bold to go to the beast God mountain range alone!”</p><p>Before the middle-aged man could speak, the young girl spoke first.</p><p>“Beast God mountain range?”</p><p>make such arrangements.</p><p>little brother, you can rest in peace. Your injuries are too serious. Lu Ming was puzzled. He did not have any impression of this.</p><p>Perhaps, this was arranged by the white-robed old man!</p><p>Perhaps, this was just an illusion. This should be the last test, but what was the test?</p><p>Lu Ming was very puzzled. He did not understand why they had to make such arrangements.</p><p>little brother, you can rest in peace. Your injuries are too serious. It will take a long time for you to fully recover. If you need anything in the future, just let me know!</p><p>The middle-aged man said in a straightforward and magnanimous manner.</p><p>“Thank you, big brother. I’ll never forget the kindness of saving my life!”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to cup his fists, but the moment he moved his hand, it pulled at his wound. There was a tearing pain that made him gasp.</p><p>“Little brother, don’t move and just focus on recuperating!”</p><p>The middle-aged man smiled.</p><p>After that, the middle-aged man and the middle-aged woman left the place. The young girl brought a bowl of medicine from outside and fed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m Xia Hua. My father’s name is Xia Hu. Big brother, what’s your name? ”</p><p>Xia Hua blinked her eyes and looked at Lu Ming. She was still very curious as to why Lu Ming went to the beast God mountain range alone. That was an extremely dangerous place.</p><p>“My name is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming? I’ll call you big brother Lu. I’ll call you separately from my father. I don’t want to call you uncle. You don’t look very old!”</p><p>Xia Hua mumbled.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming stayed there to recuperate.</p><p>As the days passed, Lu Ming’s injuries slowly improved.</p><p>Half a month later, Lu Ming could already get out of bed and walk.</p><p>In front of the stone house, Lu Ming leaned against the wall and surveyed his surroundings.</p><p>There were many stone houses in this area. Lu Ming understood that this was a tribe.</p><p>There were not many people in this tribe. There were about a thousand of them. They were very simple and made a living by hunting. Lu Ming had the illusion that he had returned to the ancient times.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, the people in the tribe were all very powerful. The power of an adult man was not weaker than a first level Martial Emperor. Some were even stronger and had reached the Saint realm, such as Xia Hua’s father, Xia Hu.</p><p>In the tribe, there was a hunting team that often went out to hunt. The last time, Lu Ming was discovered by the hunting team on the beast God mountain.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming had tried his best to find out about this place. He wanted to speculate what his assessment would be. However, as the days passed, Lu Ming seemed to have integrated into the tribe and almost forgot about the assessment.</p><p>little brother Lu, get up. I’ll give you this jug of wine. I brewed it with 18 kinds of herbs. It’s very nourishing and will help you recover!</p><p>A white-haired old man came to Lu Ming with a pot of wine and smiled.</p><p>“Many thanks, uncle li!”</p><p>Lu Ming took it and thanked him with a smile.</p><p>“Haha, you’re welcome. You have to recover soon!”</p><p>The old man laughed and left.</p><p>Then, there were people from the tribe who brought Lu Ming the meat of ferocious beasts to nourish his body.</p><p>&Nbsp; the people of the tribe were simple and honest, so such things happened all the time.</p><p>Lu Ming gradually integrated into the tribe.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s injuries were already 70 – 80% healed. At this moment, a trace of Saint energy finally appeared in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. With the recovery of his holy power, he would have the ability to protect himself. He could then go further and find out what the assessment was about.</p><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the tribe for two months.</p><p>Now, his injuries had completely recovered.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming’s surprise, his cultivation had not fully recovered. It was the same as when he was in the chaotic battle on the fighting ring. His cultivation and the power of law were all sealed.</p><p>The only thing he could use now was the Coiling Dragon Spear. The strength of his Saint power was still at the lower tier of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>it’s been two months. What’s the test this time? ”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly and could not understand.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Suddenly, deafening rumbles came from the tribe. It was the sound of war drums.</p><p>the evil demons are here, the evil demons are here! Prepare to face the enemy!</p><p>A loud roar echoed throughout the entire tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The evil demon is here!”</p><p>Xia Hua’s face was a little pale.</p><p>“What is a demon?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>fiends, three-eyed fiends. I’ve heard that these fiends are wreaking havoc in other territories. They leave no one alive wherever they go. I didn’t expect them to be here!</p><p>Xia Hua’s face was pale, but she still gritted her teeth, picked up a big bow, and rushed out.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed out.</p><p>As soon as he rushed out, Lu Ming saw many tall and burly figures appearing in the sky. These figures were covered in black scales and had an eye between their brows.</p><p>Three-eyed God race!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. This was clearly a three-eyed God. Lu Ming had seen it a few times.</p><p>“Kill, kill all these ants!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
