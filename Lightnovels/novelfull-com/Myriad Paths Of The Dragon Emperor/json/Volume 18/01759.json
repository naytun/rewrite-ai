Thump! Thump!</p><p>Terrifying collisions rang out continuously. The two of them collided for over a hundred times in a row, and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow flew far away like a ball.</p><p>...</p><p>He spread his wings and flapped them a few times before he stopped.</p><p>this Lu Ming is so powerful. His entire body is covered in a layer of chaotic light. He’s not afraid of the Golden Crow clan’s divine Sunfire at all!</p><p>the Laws of Chaos. It’s really the Laws of Chaos. Lu Ming is really the son of chaos!</p><p>one of the sons of heaven, the son of chaos, actually appeared in the ancient Moon Holy Land. I heard that in heaven Emperor City, the son of death and the Son of eternity, who are also sons of heaven, also appeared!</p><p>it’s not just the Son of Heaven. Many King physiques have also appeared in heavenly Emperor City. It’s too shocking. A great era has descended!</p><p>the era of the clash of philosophers and the struggle between the Kings is coming!</p><p>In the surroundings, many of the older generation sighed.</p><p>you alone are not enough. Ten thousand celestial soldiers, come at me together!</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Wan tianbing said coldly. Spots of light lit up all over his body, and Saint weapons flew out.</p><p>There were more than 100 pieces in total.</p><p>Among them, there were three great saint weapons.</p><p>Wan tianbing held a great saint weapon in his hand. The Qi of the weapon converged, and the sharp aura stirred up a terrible sword mark in the Phoenix Lake.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Wan tianbing’s body was surrounded by holy weapons as he charged toward Lu Ming. The sword radiance was shocking as it slashed toward Lu Ming’s vital parts.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a long cry. He flapped his wings and charged toward Lu Ming like a golden ray of light. Before he even reached Lu Ming, the scorching hot divine Sun Fire was already heading toward him.</p><p>At the same time, the three-legged golden crow’s claws were extremely sharp as it clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The three-legged golden crow’s third claw was extremely terrifying. It was said to be indestructible and could crush holy weapons.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed out two fingers in a row, using 20% of the power of the chaotic tribulation finger. Two huge fingers formed and pointed at the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With two loud bangs, Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow trembled and glided backward, leaving two terrifying waves of air in the air.</p><p>Many people gasped. Lu Ming was so powerful. He was fighting two people alone and could actually force Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow into a disadvantageous position. It was too shocking.</p><p>The most important thing was that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only in the great circle of the bright Saint stage, while Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow were already in the great circle of the bright Saint stage and were one step away from the great saint stage.</p><p>Even with his high cultivation, he was still no match.</p><p>The WAN family of the Golden Crow clan had ugly expressions.</p><p>as expected of the son of chaos. His combat strength is too shocking. In a battle of the same level, no one can match him except for the other sons and Kings!</p><p>An old man exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Many of the young heaven’s favorites were pale.</p><p>This level of combat strength was much stronger than theirs.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow roared. They could not lose this battle.</p><p>More light spots lit up on Wan tianbing’s body, and more holy weapons flew out, making him even stronger.</p><p>A sun really did appear above the Golden Crow sixth Prince’s head. It shone with boundless light and exuded a terrifying power.</p><p>“Be destroyed under my sun!”</p><p>die! the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow roared. The sun came straight for Lu Ming, as if it was a real sun that was going to burn Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the sixth Prince of the Golden crow’s divine power, and its power had reached 40%.</p><p>The power of a sacred art at 40% completion was absolutely terrifying.</p><p>Once this move was used, no matter how many ordinary great circle bright Saints came, they would all die and be burned to ashes. Ordinary great saints, if their super power Technique was not well-practiced, would also have to retreat and not dare to take it head-on.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>The Laws of Chaos circulated on Lu Ming’s body and he pointed his finger.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos in the world were being controlled. Endless energy gathered at Lu Ming’s finger. The energy within a hundred-mile radius seemed to have been sucked dry in an instant.</p><p>A huge finger, like the finger of a God, was pointed at the Golden Crow sixth Crown Prince.</p><p>His finger collided with the scorching sun in the air.</p><p>At this moment, a dazzling light burst out in the sky, making it so that people couldn’t open their eyes. Some of the weaker cultivators even shed tears from the light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, there was an explosion like the explosion of a sun. The chaotic finger of tribulation continued to strike forward and heavily hit the body of the sixth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying far away. His blood splattered across the Phoenix Lake, and golden feathers filled the sky.</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow was severely injured.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming pointed with the finger of tribulation of chaos, he stepped into the void, surrounded by his holy weapon, and rushed toward Wan tianbing.</p><p>Ten thousand celestial soldiers charged at Lu Ming as well. Both of them used the ten thousand soldiers art. Their battle soldier Qi gathered and collided fiercely with each other. A beam of battle soldier Qi shot up into the sky like a pillar of light, reflecting the light from the exploding sun.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The divine sword technique burst out and two sword gleams shot out from his eyes.</p><p>Although geniuses like Wan tianbing had very powerful soul power and had soul-protecting treasures, Lu Ming’s cultivation had improved and his soul power had become stronger. He would still have an impact on his opponent.</p><p>Wan tianbing’s eyes showed a trace of pain as he thrust the divine sword technique.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his great holy weapon-grade combat sword and slashed at Wan tianbing.</p><p>Wan tianbing roared in anger and counterattacked with all his might, slashing out a sword light.</p><p>The two swords clashed, causing the sky to buzz. Then, a figure retreated quickly.</p><p>It was Wan tianbing. He was suppressed by Lu Ming in a head-on confrontation.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to charge at Wan tianbing with an imposing aura and a murderous aura that soared to the sky.</p><p>Wan tianbing used all his strength to counterattack.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them kept clashing against each other in the rainbow-like soldier Qi, but each time they clashed, Wan tianbing would be forced to take a few steps back. After dozens of moves, he had already taken hundreds of steps back.</p><p>His arms started to tremble.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>At this moment, Wan tianbing’s expression turned ferocious. An acupoint between his brows glowed with brilliant light. Then, a huge battle-axe appeared, emitting terrifying fluctuations.</p><p>an absolute Saint weapon! That’s an absolute Saint weapon! How can a ten thousand celestial weapon seal an absolute Saint weapon? ”</p><p>what? ” someone exclaimed in the surroundings.</p><p>it must be the help of a monarch. Otherwise, the ten thousand celestial soldiers wouldn’t be able to seal the absolute Saint weapon. They would be torn apart by the absolute Saint weapon! someone said.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming is in danger. The ten thousand celestial soldiers aren’t much weaker than him to begin with. Once he uses his holy weapon, Lu Ming won’t be able to withstand it!</p><p>As the voices rang out, Huang Ling, mu Qingxue, and the others revealed worried expressions.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes were shining, but he was not worried.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Wan tianbing wielded his holy weapon, the battleaxe, and struck out. The void trembled as if it was going to be split apart by this strike.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming used his great saint weapon to block the attack. The sword trembled and an unstoppable force gushed out. Lu Ming was sent flying back thousands of meters before he could regain his balance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
