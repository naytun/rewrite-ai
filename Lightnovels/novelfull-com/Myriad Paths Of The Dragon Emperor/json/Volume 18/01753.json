Now, he was in the limelight and outshone all the other geniuses. This made him extremely jealous. He hated himself for not being the one in the limelight.</p><p>...</p><p>“Looks like this kid is interested in Huang Ling, and I’m afraid that Huang Ling has taken a fancy to this kid as well. Hmph, I won’t let you guys have your way!”</p><p>Qin Feng’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He was fighting with the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. At this time, he deliberately trembled and retreated, exposing Huang Ling to the attack of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming and mu Qingxue were both shocked.</p><p>With Qin Feng’s combat power, he should have no problem blocking the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. But now, he was forced to retreat by the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. This was not normal, but there was no time to think about it.</p><p>“Feng Ling, get down!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a long cry. His golden wings flapped out like blades toward Huang Ling.</p><p>The Phoenix Spirit could not counterattack and could only defend passively.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The unperishable flame on Huang Ling’s body trembled violently as if it was about to be shattered. Her delicate body trembled and she couldn’t help but take a few steps back. She spat out a mouthful of blood and her face turned pale.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! the ninth golden Crow Prince shouted. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he launched a violent attack at Huang Ling.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue was anxious, but she was entangled with her opponent and couldn’t save him.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted. His body lit up with light spots and holy weapons appeared.</p><p>One by one, the Saint weapons and battle weapon Qis linked together and shot up into the sky like pillars of light.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming threw out a great saint weapon, which flew towards the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow with a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was shocked. He did not expect that Lu Ming would still have the energy to attack him when he was fighting against the four heaven’s favorites. He flapped his wings and a sun appeared, trying to block Lu Ming’s sword radiance.</p><p>However, it was useless. The sword directly pierced through the sun and one of the ninth Prince’s wings. The terrifying power made him retreat and almost tore off one of his wings.</p><p>“The ten thousand soldiers scroll, how do you know the ten thousand soldiers scroll?”</p><p>Wan Tianlong cried out in disbelief.</p><p>Huang Jian and the others were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming actually knew the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long cry. One after another, holy weapons rained down on the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow like a storm. The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow fought back with all his might, but in the next moment, wounds appeared on his body. Golden feathers scattered in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the Tai Chi disk array. It emitted a bright light and suppressed the desolate sword.</p><p>Huang Jian held his iron sword with both hands and fought against the Tai Chi formation.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fingers flowed with the Laws of Chaos. He pointed his finger out and a huge finger formed. It was like the finger of a God, capable of destroying and suppressing everything. The chaotic finger of tribulation, which was at its peak, burst out at full force.</p><p>The target of this finger was still the desolate sword.</p><p>Huang Jian’s eyes were serious. He growled, and his sword Qi was wild. His entire body seemed to be covered in iron swords.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The chaotic finger of tribulation touched the iron sword. Huang Jian’s body trembled and he flew backward. He fell down the Jade stairs with blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The others were shocked. Lu Ming was too powerful. He had injured the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow and the barren sword in succession. He was like an undefeatable God of War.</p><p>The remaining few people could not help but retreat. They looked at Lu Ming grimly and stopped their attacks.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how did you manage to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers art?”</p><p>Wan Tianlong glared at Lu Ming and barked coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not answer.</p><p>legend has it that the Laws of Chaos are ever-changing and can be transformed into thousands of laws. Except for some King path laws and Supreme laws, they can all be changed. It’s not surprising that he has cultivated the ten thousand soldier scroll!</p><p>Huang Jian said as he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>it seems like this person is really the son of chaos!</p><p>The purple-robed youth said, his eyes filled with solemness.</p><p>Huang Bing, you’re on your own now. We’ve tried our best!</p><p>Huang Jian shook his head and sheathed his combat sword. He sat down and began to heal himself.</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s figure moved and he also floated back. It was obvious that he had given up on stopping Feng Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming was too powerful and his combat strength was unparalleled. Even if so many of them joined forces, it would be useless.</p><p>They had tried their best. They were only here to help, so they didn’t need to risk their lives.</p><p>Wan Tianlong’s gaze was extremely cold. He swept a few glances at Lu Ming, then glided away.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Holy weapons flew back into his body.</p><p>The ninth golden Crow Prince was in a miserable state. He was covered in blood and almost all of his golden feathers had fallen off. He had become a hairless Crow.</p><p>The others looked at the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow with a strange expression. They wanted to laugh, but they were too embarrassed to.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, I want you to die!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>This was a great humiliation.</p><p>The Golden Crow Tribe was known as the divine beasts of the sun. They were extremely proud and had once competed with the true dragon and phoenix in ancient times. They were definitely a top divine beast.</p><p>However, as the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow Tribe, he had been stripped naked by Lu Ming in front of everyone. This was a blatant humiliation.</p><p>a sick bird still dares to be so arrogant. Looks like I’ll have roasted bird meat to eat today!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes gleamed coldly as he stared at the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow with hostility.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was covered in cold air. He retreated in a frenzy, his eyes flashing with fear.</p><p>“A sick bird really doesn’t have the guts. Hurry up and get lost!”</p><p>shut up! Lu Ming shouted and stepped forward to Huang Ling’s side. He glanced at Qin Feng coldly.</p><p>Qin Feng’s face darkened.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Kong and Huang Bing’s faces were extremely gloomy. Lu Ming’s combat strength had far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>It was impossible for them to force Huang Ling down. They could only rely on themselves.</p><p>The cries of phoenixes continued to ring out as Huang Ling and the others continued to move forward.</p><p>However, as time passed, Huang Ling’s advantage grew. Her speed did not change, but Huang Kong and Huang Bing’s speed became slower and slower.</p><p>They could only watch as the Phoenix Spirit approached the peak.</p><p>A few hours later, Huang Ling reached the top of the mountain.</p><p>When Huang Ling stepped onto the mountain peak, a flaming phoenix let out a long cry and soared into the sky. Her aura rose sharply.</p><p>“I’ve broken through!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>When she reached the top of the mountain, Huang Ling’s cultivation had actually broken through a level. She had broken through from the upper tier of a bright Saint to the peak of a bright Saint.</p><p>It seemed that this Jade ladder was not only a trial and test for the disciples of Phoenix Palace, but also an opportunity.</p><p>Huang Bing, Huang Kong, and Huang Xuan stopped and sighed. They knew that they had lost the competition.</p><p>Huang Ling’s aura rose sharply. After a while, she retracted it. At this moment, some leaves fell from the ancient parasol tree and formed a Phoenix.</p><p>Huang Ling leaped onto the Phoenix’s back. The Phoenix let out a long cry and flew straight up to the ancient parasol tree.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
