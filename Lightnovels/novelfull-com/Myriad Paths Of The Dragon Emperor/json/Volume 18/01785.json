Her appearance was no less than Huang Ling and Xie nianqing, but she had an extra temperament, a charming temperament. Her every smile and every move seemed to be full of charm.</p><p>...</p><p>At the scene, most of the young men were tempted and stared at Luo Tianyi with fiery eyes.</p><p>Wan Pingyang was the same. His eyes were burning as he looked at Luo Tianyi, unable to move his eyes away.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare. It’s my honor to be able to meet Tian Yi saintess today!” saintess, you’re a heavenly beauty, like a goddess. It’s my good fortune to meet you today!</p><p>Some self-proclaimed handsome sovereigns immediately opened their mouths, trying to attract Luo Tianyi’s attention.</p><p>Every time the Holy maiden was born, the Jade pool would choose a Guardian to grow up with her.</p><p>To put it simply, a Dao protector was a Dao companion and a husband.</p><p>…..</p><p>This was the case for the ordinary Holy maidens, and it was even more so for the Holy successor.</p><p>If they could become the Guardians of the Jade lake’s Holy successor, they would not only get a rare beauty, but also enjoy the vast resources of the Jade Lake. Who wouldn’t want that?</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled and waved her hand. “Tian Yi thanks everyone for coming, please sit!”</p><p>Everyone took their seats, but there was one exception.</p><p>It was a purple-robed young man with a burly figure. The most eye-catching thing about him was his purple hair that fluttered in the wind. He was filled with an unbridled arrogance.</p><p>He stared at Luo Tianyi with fiery eyes and said,” “Holy maiden, you are sitting alone in the pavilion. Aren’t you lonely? How about I accompany you?”</p><p>With that, the man rose into the air and stepped forward, about to step into the pavilion.</p><p>“It’s Xu tuo from the Skywolf tower!”</p><p>Someone said. They recognized this young man. He was an extremely powerful heaven s favorite.</p><p>Xu tuo stepped forward and quickly approached the pavilion.</p><p>The nine ordinary saintesses of the Jade Lake looked awful.</p><p>This man’s behavior was an insult to the Holy Virgin of the Jade Lake.</p><p>“This brother, you’ve gone too far, Tian Yi Saint did not invite you up!”</p><p>An ordinary saintess rose into the air and blocked in front of Xu tuo.</p><p>“I can’t go if they didn’t invite me? Didn’t the Jade Lake Saint Come out to find a man? Do you think I’m not qualified?”</p><p>Xu tuo said, his purple hair flying in the wind. He stared at Luo Tianyi with fiery eyes and was very overbearing.</p><p>“Mind your words!”</p><p>The ordinary holy virgins of the Jade Lake looked even worse.</p><p>Xu tuo’s words were an insult.</p><p>“What are you pretending for? Women are born to be enjoyed by men. Otherwise, what’s the use of being born in this world? get out of my way!”</p><p>Xu tuo’s aura was wild as he shouted. His shout was like a wolf howling at the moon. The ordinary saintesses ‘faces turned pale and their bodies trembled as they retreated.</p><p>Xu tuo was obviously in the Supreme Saint realm and was extremely powerful. He was one of the top heaven’s favorites in ancient Moon Holy Land and came from the powerful force, Sky Wolf tower.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>With a loud shout, he forced a few ordinary saintesses back. Xu tuo became even more arrogant as he stepped forward, causing the void to crack.</p><p>“The people of the Skywolf tower are really overbearing!”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>the sky Wolf tower is full of Sky Wolves. They are arrogant and extremely protective of their own people. They are a group of lunatics. Let’s keep our voices down!</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a few other saintesses stood in front of Xu tuo.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Many of them shouted again. Their purple hair danced in the wind as if they were about to transform into a purple Wolf and pounce.</p><p>“Let him come over!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi said.</p><p>Her expression was very calm as she sat on a Jade bench, picked up a cup of tea, and casually sipped on it.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The few saintesses nodded and made way for him.</p><p>“Hahaha, Tian Yi Saint, how about 1 be your protector? We’ll be done tonight!”</p><p>Xu tuo laughed and landed on the edge of the pavilion.</p><p>it’s not impossible to become Tian Yi’s Guardian. It all depends on whether young master has the ability to do so!</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled, full of infinite temptation. At this time, her eyes turned black, and a mysterious fluctuation spread out from her body.</p><p>At this moment, Xu tuo’s body froze. The next moment, he shouted,” “Who is it?”</p><p>Then, he turned around abruptly and threw a punch backward.</p><p>A terrifying fist force rushed into the vast void.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other. There was no one behind Xu tuo, so why was he attacking?</p><p>However, the next scene was even more shocking.</p><p>&Nbsp; Xu tuo roared and punched continuously. His face was twisted as if he was fighting someone. After punching a few hundred times, he spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Illusion, Xu tuo was under an illusion!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>It was obvious that Xu ta was under an illusion.</p><p>However, with Xu tuo’s cultivation level, it was shocking that he had fallen for the illusion without even realizing it.</p><p>At this time, Xu tuo also woke up and looked at Luo Tianyi with an ugly expression.</p><p>young master can’t even sit on this seat. It seems that young master is not qualified to be Tian Yi’s Dao protector!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said, still smiling.</p><p>“Xu ta, you should come down. With your cultivation, you’re not qualified!”</p><p>Someone said in disdain.</p><p>Many of the geniuses who came today had cultivation realms that were not inferior to Xu tuo’s. They were not afraid of him.</p><p>Xu tuo’s expression turned even uglier. He snorted coldly, turned around, and stepped into the air, leaving the Jade Lake divine Palace.</p><p>He was too embarrassed to stay. He had been overbearing and said that he wanted Luo Tianyi to be his woman. Now, Luo Tianyi had not even made a move, and he was already injured. Obviously, he was far from Luo Tianyi.</p><p>whoever wants to have a drink with me, just come up. As long as you can enter the pavilion from this Jade ladder, I will drink with you today!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said with a smile.</p><p>This made many people’s hearts beat faster.</p><p>As the saying goes, the pavilion closest to the water enjoys the moonlight first. If he could sit and drink tea with Luo Tianyi and get closer to her, he might have a chance to win her over in the future.</p><p>The eyes of many powerful geniuses flickered.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>In the crowd, a golden light flashed, and an unruly young man in a golden robe flew up the Jade ladder, then stepped toward the pavilion.</p><p>“It’s the fifth Prince of the Golden Crow clan!”</p><p>Someone recognized this person.</p><p>“The Golden Crow race!”</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>It was said that the Golden Crow race was extremely powerful. In this generation, there were ten crown princes, each stronger than the last. They were all extremely terrifying existences.</p><p>The fifth Prince of the Golden Crow was also very famous. He had reached the Supreme Saint realm a few years ago.</p><p>…..</p><p>The fifth Prince of the Golden Crow wore a serious expression. His entire body was enveloped in the divine Sun Fire. He walked up step by step, but when he was halfway there, he suddenly stopped and his body began to tremble.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>In the end, he closed his eyes and roared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A dazzling divine Sun Fire rushed out of his body as if it was trying to fight against something. But after a moment, his body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was thrown back like a kite with a broken string..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
