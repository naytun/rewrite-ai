In addition to the absolute Saints from the tianshen sect, the evil moon sect, and the jiuxiao sword sect, there were nine people in total.</p><p>...</p><p>However, two of them had been seriously injured by the sneak attack. The situation was not in the cloud Dragon Valley master’s favor.</p><p>“Nine appearances of Cloud Dragon!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master kept slashing out with his sword. The sword light turned into nine cloud Dragons that flew out and blocked the absolute Saints in the air.</p><p>However, the absolute Saints attacked and defeated the cloud Dragon.</p><p>Although the cloud Dragon Valley master was strong, he was only one person. It would be difficult for him to stop the Joint Forces of several people.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few absolute Saints shouted. They controlled laws and used their superpowers to form a terrifying offensive power that poured towards the cloud Dragon Valley master. There were also some with terrifying combat power that was not much weaker than the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a dragon roar, the Ice Dragon patriarch rushed over with a terrifying cold current. He sent an absolute Saint flying with one move and almost froze him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon roared and struck out with its claws. The other two absolute Saints were also forced back.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch and the cloud Dragon Valley master stood together to protect Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shrieked. At least five absolute Saints charged toward Lu Ming. However, the cloud Dragon Valley master and the Ice Dragon patriarch didn’t want to make any mistakes, so they guarded the area tightly. The other party couldn’t get past them for a while.</p><p>In Xie nianqing’s sea of consciousness, the battle had already entered a state of white heat.</p><p>The blood demon patriarch was an Emperor-level powerhouse after all. Even with his soul fragment, he was still terrifying. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were no match for him. They were surrounded by the blood demon patriarch in a bloody light.</p><p>The blood-red light contained the power of laws. She wanted to refine Lu Ming and Xie nianqing together.</p><p>“Hehehe, your fate has already been decided. Just accept your fate!”</p><p>The blood demon King let out a sharp laugh. A bloody mist filled the air. Lu Ming felt a tearing pain in his soul. Xie nianqing’s spiritual will trembled as if it could not withstand it anymore.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was unwilling to give up. His soul turned into a long sword and slashed at the blood mist around him. Unfortunately, as the battle continued, Lu Ming’s soul force became weaker and weaker. It was already difficult for him to cause fatal damage to the blood demon King.</p><p>“Struggle, struggle with all your might. This is your last chance!”</p><p>The blood demon Queen laughed.</p><p>She seemed to enjoy the process of Lu Ming and the rest struggling.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s spine emitted a blood-red light. Then, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged.</p><p>With a whoosh, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline rushed into Xie nianqing’s glabella and entered his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as it arrived in Xie nianqing’s consciousness, the prison-suppressing stele changed rapidly like a mountain. The two words ‘prison stele’ below it gave off a brilliant light and pressed down on the blood demon master.</p><p>“Prison-suppressing stele, how is that possible?”</p><p>The blood demon King shrieked.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Under the suppression of the prison-suppressing stele, the blood demon King let out a scream. The blood mist rolled and formed an old woman’s body again. Her face was full of shock and horror.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele grew larger and larger. The two words seemed to have infinite power, and once again pressed down on the blood demon King.</p><p>The blood demon Queen screamed and retreated quickly, but it was useless. She seemed to have been locked by the prison-suppressing stele and had nowhere to escape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the blood demon King’s body directly exploded. Balls of soul power were obliterated by the power of the prison-suppressing stele. When the blood demon King gathered together again, her body had shrunk a lot, and she looked dispirited.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele obviously had no intention of letting her go. It pressed down again.</p><p>The blood demon master screamed in fear. She was going crazy. She never dreamed that the prison-suppressing stele would appear here.</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele was the nemesis of her clan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the blood demon King was even more miserable. His form was directly shattered, and after a roll, it was difficult for him to reform.</p><p>At this moment, a black crystal appeared in Xie nianqing’s consciousness. It emitted a terrifying devouring power and was about to devour the blood demon King’s soul.</p><p>“It’s my world-core!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He controlled the prison-suppressing stele and it flew back to his head.</p><p>“Ah, don’t!”</p><p>The blood demon King kept screaming, as if he was extremely frightened. However, there were still balls of soul energy that were absorbed by the world core.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized it. The world core at this moment was what he had obtained in the core of the divine Ruins continent back then. He had thought that it was a saint’s heart, but now it seemed that it was a world core left behind by an Emperor-level powerhouse.</p><p>The soul energy of the blood demon King was continuously devoured by the world core. In the end, only a black shadow was left, constantly twisting and struggling.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was because the black shadow that had appeared at the end did not look like a human at all. Although it had the form of a human, it was extremely strange. It was like a shadow, and there was an eye in the middle of its brows.</p><p>It had a total of three eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was reminded of the three-eyed God race and the terrifying creature that fought the Titan bull. It also had three eyes.</p><p>What was the connection between all these?</p><p>Could it be that this black shadow was the true body of the blood demon King?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, the prison-suppressing stele was not under Lu Ming’s control. It flew out of his body and pressed down on the black shadow.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The black shadow screamed in fear, but under the prison-suppressing stele, the black shadow exploded and turned into ashes.</p><p>The remnant soul of the blood demon master was finally crushed to death by the prison-suppressing stele. Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to cultivate in seclusion!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing spoke. The world core seemed to have absorbed the blood demon King’s soul energy and had undergone a change.</p><p>alright, you can go into seclusion. I’ll protect you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. The next moment, her spiritual will disappeared. Lu Ming, on the other hand, left Xie nianqing’s sea of consciousness with the prison-suppressing stele and returned to his body.</p><p>As soon as he returned to his body, Lu Ming heard a loud boom. He turned around and saw the cloud Dragon Valley master and the Ice Dragon patriarch fighting five absolute Saints.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the Ice Dragon patriarch were barely able to resist the five absolute Saints, but they didn’t take a step back. Instead, they stood firmly in front of them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and strode forward with the reincarnation halberd in his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you succeed?!”</p><p>Asked the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>it’s a success. The blood demon master has been killed!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread throughout the entire area, causing many people to be shocked.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect started to scream like a madman.</p><p>With the blood demon king’s death, her years of hard work would be in vain. Her face was distorted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
