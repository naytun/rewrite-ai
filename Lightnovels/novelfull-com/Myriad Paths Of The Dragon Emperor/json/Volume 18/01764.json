Long Chen</h1><p>Chapter 1764 Lu Ming vs. Long Chen</p><p>Long Chen was the number one person among the divine wilderness continent’s younger generation. He had awakened one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the immemorial Dragon elephant bloodline. He was extremely powerful and had unparalleled combat strength.</p><p>After that, he took a Big Shot from divine elephant sect as his master and came to ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>So many years had passed. Lu Ming was very curious to see how far Long Chen had progressed.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them stood in the sky, facing each other. A terrifying aura burst out from their bodies. The two auras collided fiercely, and the clouds in the surroundings were blown apart and scattered in all directions.</p><p>“Great circle of the bright Saint stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that Long Chen’s cultivation base was at the great circle of the bright Saint stage, not far from the Supreme Saint stage.</p><p>This was normal. Although Long Chen’s cultivation had been surpassed by Lu Ming back then, Lu Ming had come to ancient Moon Holy Land and acknowledged an expert from divine elephant sect as his master. The resources he had obtained were definitely far greater than Lu Ming’s. It was normal for him to be a perfected bright saint now.</p><p>Roar! OWW!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar and an elephant’s cry rang out at the same time, and a strange phenomenon appeared above their heads.</p><p>There were Nine Dragons and an Archean dragonesque elephant, both of which had the aura and Majesty of looking down on the world.</p><p>Then, the two of them moved at the same time.</p><p>The two figures charged at each other at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was flowing with the Laws of Chaos. He used the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck out with his palm. His palm seemed to have turned into a prison-suppressing stele, pressing down on Long Chen.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hold back against Long Chen. He unleashed his full power.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The trumpeting of an elephant sounded from Long Chen’s body. His body swelled up, and his arms grew rapidly. His muscles tightened, as if they were filled with infinite power.</p><p>The two palms hit each other hard.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>It was as if two stars had collided. The sky trembled and the space trembled violently. An invisible force burst out from where the two had clashed, sweeping across thousands of miles and destroying all the clouds.</p><p>The two of them separated after a single strike, and their figures retreated at the same time.</p><p>“What a terrifying power. This is … Extreme force law!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. He could see Long Chen’s law.</p><p>Long Chen’s law was the extreme law, known as the ultimate power. With the flow of the law, he could release a terrifying power that could break all laws.</p><p>This was a terrifying Maxim. Although it was not as powerful as the ten ultimate maxims, it was not too far off. It was one of the most terrifying maxims under the ten ultimate maxims.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Long Chen’s fighting spirit was like a rainbow. He was like an ancient divine elephant, stepping on the void and exhausting his strength.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming had nothing to fear. He cultivated the chaos laws, one of the strongest laws in the world. He also had the prison suppressing heaven technique. With the two combined, each attack contained infinite power that could suppress everything.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two of them struck each other for the second time, and an even more intense boom rang out between heaven and earth.</p><p>This time, the two of them trembled and continued to attack each other.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Terrifying collisions occurred one after another. The two of them seemed to have transformed into ancient wild beasts, suppressing the world. The two figures flickered in the sky, and terrifying energy constantly burst out.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged over a hundred moves, and neither of them had a clear winner.</p><p>Long Chen’s spiritual body was also a medium-grade heaven spiritual body, and the laws were extreme laws. Both of them were slightly weaker than Lu Ming, but their cultivation levels were much higher.</p><p>It was difficult to determine a winner in the battle between the two.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another exchange of blows, and the two figures drifted back.</p><p>“Awesome! Lu Ming, I’m going to cast my divine ability next. You have to be careful!”</p><p>The fighting spirit in Long Chen’s eyes grew stronger.</p><p>“Same to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. His blood was boiling and the Laws of Chaos circulated throughout his body.</p><p>“Divine elephant fist of utmost strength!”</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” Primal Chaos tribulation finger! the two of them shouted at the same time as they used the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t hide his strength. Instead, he unleashed 33% of his chaotic finger of tribulation at full force. A huge finger, like the finger of a God, pointed at Long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen threw a punch, and a giant elephant appeared in the sky. It let out a long roar, stepped on the void, and leaped toward Lu Ming, as if it wanted to destroy time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The finger of Primal Chaos tribulation collided with the giant statue, resulting in a deafening boom. Lu Ming and Long Chen used the force of the collision to fly back hundreds of miles, looking at each other from a distance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I haven’t seen you for many years and you’re still as strong as ever. Today’s battle was really enjoyable. How about we spar another day?”</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“You’re also very strong. Let’s spar another day!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“In a few days, when there’s news from my master’s side, I’ll come to find you!”</p><p>With that, Long Chen turned around and left. Of course, Lu Ming did not notice that Long Chen’s hand, which he had kept in his sleeve, was trembling.</p><p>After long Chen left, Lu Ming shook his numb hand and smiled bitterly. “My cultivation is still a little weak!”</p><p>To be honest, Long Chen was very strong. Lu Ming had a vague feeling that Long Chen might not have used his full strength in the last Divine Art.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had more tricks up his sleeve. If he were to go all out, Long Chen might not be able to defeat him.</p><p>With a smile, Lu Ming turned around and flew back to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming spent the next few days cultivating.</p><p>Three days later, Long Chen arrived at the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Your master didn’t agree?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>when I become a divine Emperor, I will be able to kill my way to the Azure continent and use the 23:58</p><p>teleportation array to return to the divine wilderness!</p><p>Long Chen’s face was full of bitterness as well. He sat down in Lu Ming’s courtyard, took out a bottle of wine, and took a big gulp. that’s right. I told my master about the evil spirit cult and wanted to ask him to send people to annihilate them, but he rejected me directly. He said that such a small matter should be left to me to solve!</p><p>“Leave it to you to deal with it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also quite speechless.</p><p>sigh, it seems like I can’t return for the time being. I have to work hard and cultivate. In the future, when I become a divine Emperor, I will be able to kill my way to the Azure continent and use the teleportation array to return to the divine wilderness!</p><p>Long Chen said helplessly.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It seemed that this was a test from Long Chen’s master.</p><p>“So fragrant, there’s more wine to drink!”</p><p>A tender voice could be heard from outside the courtyard. Then, they saw bubbles scuttle in from the outside with Huang Ling following behind her.</p><p>In the past few days, bubbles and Phoenix spirit had gotten to know each other better. They were together every day, running around the Phoenix Palace. There were quite a few sacred elixirs in the Phoenix Palace that had entered her stomach.</p><p>“Little girl, you also like to drink. Here, have a jar!”</p><p>A wine jar appeared in Long Chen’s hand and he tossed it to bubbles.</p><p>Bubble grabbed it in his hand, opened the cover, and took a big gulp. He was so happy that his eyes narrowed.</p><p>“This little guy is really greedy!”</p><p>Huang Ling walked in and smiled.</p><p>“Just in time, I still have a golden crow’s wing that I haven’t eaten yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took out a Golden Wing. Holy power surged and the Golden crow’s feathers on the wing were plucked out. He began to roast it.</p><p>Huang Ling was stunned. She did not expect Lu Ming to really dare to roast the Golden crow’s wings.</p><p>Not long after, the fragrance assailed their nostrils, and the few of them began to gobble it up, especially bubbles. They ate until their mouths were covered in oil, and their eyes narrowed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. A token rushed out of his body and emitted a dazzling light.</p><p>Mixed essence token!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
