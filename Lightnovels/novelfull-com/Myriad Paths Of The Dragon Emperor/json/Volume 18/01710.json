Their bodies glowed as if they were resonating with each other. Slowly, the main body and secondary body gradually leaned against each other and fused together. It was as if two figures were overlapping.</p><p>Of course, this process was very slow and couldn’t be achieved overnight. It required time.</p><p>...</p><p>This was because it was not only the body that was fused, but also the soul, cultivation, and so on. It was very complicated.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>Outside the Dragon God Valley, the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect were stationed there. They surrounded the Dragon God Valley and did not allow the disciples to enter or leave.</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>The three major sects were still stationed outside Dragon God Valley and had no intention of leaving.</p><p>At this time, the atmosphere in Dragon God Valley was getting more and more depressing.</p><p>With the three major sects sealing off the exit, would the people of Dragon God Valley be trapped like this for the rest of their lives?</p><p>At this moment, there was a voice in the Dragon God Valley, calling for Lu Ming to be handed over.</p><p>Lu Ming is selfish. He obtained Emperor Cang’s legacy and treasures and kept them for himself to improve his cultivation and combat strength. In the end, he wants others to pay for him? ”</p><p>there are so many people in Dragon God Valley. How can they be implicated by Lu Ming? he’s benefitted, but others have to die with him!</p><p>“He’s hiding and not showing himself, but he has implicated the entire Dragon God Valley. Hand over Lu Ming, and Dragon God Valley will return to its normal state!”</p><p>Such voices became more and more intense. Many people slowly shifted their anger to Lu Ming. They felt that Lu Ming was selfish and that he had benefited from it. In the end, when something happened, he had to hide and let others pay for it. On what basis?</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, let’s see how long you can hide for?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley, Yin Zheng, revealed a cold smile.</p><p>This sound was naturally secretly spread by Yin Zheng’s people.</p><p>Slowly, the other disciples of the Dragon God Valley were incited. They surrounded the cloud Dragon Valley and demanded that Lu Ming be handed over.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, yang tianzong’s aura was violent and powerful, causing everyone’s face to change.</p><p>Tian Chui, Xue ningxin and the others were standing on the edge of yang tianzong, blocking the entrance to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Was he bullying the other brothers of the Dragon Valley with his cultivation? The cloud Dragon Valley’s sect master is strong, but he can’t be so lawless, can he?”</p><p>“That’s right. Cloud Dragon Valley master, are you going to rely on your cultivation to protect your own disciple and ignore the lives of the other disciples of Dragon God Valley? If you have the ability, kill all the other disciples of the Dragon Valley!”</p><p>A series of cold voices rang out from the crowd.</p><p>“If you have the ability, come out and speak!”</p><p>Yang tianzong’s gaze was like lightning as he scanned the crowd. Those who were caught by his gaze felt a chill down their spine.</p><p>Hmph, although the cloud Dragon Valley master’s cultivation is strong, there are so many of us. We don’t have to be afraid of you!</p><p>The voice rang out again from the crowd.</p><p>“Sowing dissension, you deserve ten thousand deaths!”</p><p>Yang tianzong hollered and his figure suddenly flashed. He looked down from above and pounced into the crowd.</p><p>Then, with two miserable shrieks, two figures flew out of the crowd and heavily fell to the ground. They were two young men in silver robes. One of them was Yin Zisong.</p><p>it’s indeed your Silver Dragon Valley who is trying to sow discord. You have unfathomable motives. You deserve to die!</p><p>Tian Chui shouted.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Was the cloud Dragon Valley rebelling? First, you covered up for Lu Ming. Now, you can’t even tell anyone else. If you do, you’ll be killed. Don’t tell me that Dragon God Valley has become Cloud Dragon Valley’s!”</p><p>Silver pine shouted.</p><p>“You still dare to provoke me? I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>Yang tianzong’s eyes were cold as he walked towards the silver pine.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley, Yin Zheng, came over with a loud roar. He said coldly, ” Cloud Dragon Valley, don’t go too far. They just said something fair!</p><p>what Bullsh * t justice? in my opinion, it’s you, old dog, who’s trying to kill my Junior Brother Lu Ming!</p><p>Tian Chui cursed.</p><p>“Audacious! Impudent!”</p><p>Yin Zheng shouted.</p><p>Hmph, don’t take advantage of your seniority. If you have the ability, then be arrogant in front of my master. I’ve already sent a message to my master. He’ll be here soon!</p><p>Yang tianzong said.</p><p>Yin Zheng’s expression changed drastically, his eyes flashing with fear, ” “It seems that your Cloud Dragon Valley is using force to oppress others. You don’t care about the other Dragon Valley’s people at all. I guess that in your heart, all the other Dragon Valley’s people added together are not as important as one person from your Cloud Dragon Valley, right? In this case, I have nothing to say. You can kill my people of Silver Dragon Valley if you want!”</p><p>After Yin Zheng finished speaking, he waved his sleeves and left.</p><p>The other disciples of the Dragon Valley looked terrible.</p><p>this old man is extremely sinister. He must be killed!</p><p>Xue ningxin said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Yin Zheng’s words were clearly to sow discord between the other Dragon Valley and the cloud Dragon Valley. He wanted to use the other Dragon Valley’s people to force the cloud Dragon Valley to hand over Lu Ming.</p><p>Under such circumstances, they naturally couldn’t kill Yin Zisong and the others. Otherwise, Dragon God Valley would really have an internal conflict.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Yang tianzong threw the two of them out.</p><p>The conflict in Dragon God Valley was getting more and more intense. Lu Ming was still in seclusion in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After three months, Lu Ming’s main body and secondary body had completely fused together and became one.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a deafening boom came from Lu Ming’s body. His soul had also fused into one at this moment.</p><p>The fusion of the two souls caused Lu Ming’s soul force to skyrocket. It was not as simple as one plus one equals two, but it had increased by several times.</p><p>“Saint heart, condense!”</p><p>When Lu Ming’s soul fused into one, he felt that it was time to break through to the Saint realm. He growled and the laws circulated. He began to use the power of the laws to temper his vital essence and condense his Saint heart.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that there were two types of laws circulating on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The chaos laws and the array Dao laws circulated without interfering with each other. One tempered true essence while the other tempered mental energy fire.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness, the brilliant mental energy fire condensed into a ball and surged toward Lu Ming’s dantian. In the end, the mental energy fire entered Lu Ming’s dantian and floated near the spiritual God. Then, it began to roll and under the effect of the array Dao law, it began to transform into a Saint heart.</p><p>At the same time, the spiritual God also began to change.</p><p>Within the spiritual God, there was a shadow that was slowly leaving the spiritual God.</p><p>It could be seen that the shadow looked exactly like the spiritual God and Lu Ming.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>Before the Saint realm, a person’s soul had no physical form. Or rather, it didn’t have a soul at all. It only had spiritual will.</p><p>However, after a martialist broke through to the spiritual God Realm, their spiritual will would be completely integrated into the spiritual God, and they would begin to nurture their soul.</p><p>Actually, the spirit God’s greatest use was to nurture the soul.</p><p>In this aspect, it was very similar to mind fire. Mind fire also had the effect of nurturing the soul.</p><p>The spiritual God Realm and the Martial Emperor realm were both nurturing the soul. When one broke through to the Saint realm, the soul would be completely formed. Then, it could leave the spiritual God Realm and enter one’s sea of consciousness. In the future, as one’s cultivation improved, the soul would slowly become stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
