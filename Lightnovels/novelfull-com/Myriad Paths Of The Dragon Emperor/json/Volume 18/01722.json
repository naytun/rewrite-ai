It was very strange.</p><p>Lu Ming could clearly feel Mo Yang’s body trembling slightly, as if he was very afraid.</p><p>...</p><p>Blood demon King, don’t forget what you promised me!</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect said.</p><p>don’t worry. When evil spirit religion rises again, they’ll definitely have a way to help you step into the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>The giant face laughed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A thunderous voice rang out in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>How could he not understand what was going on now?</p><p>In the depths of the Tianyu demonic sect, there was a Dharma King of evil spirit. She seemed to want to use Xie nianqing’s body to be reborn, which meant that she wanted to possess Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with endless anger.</p><p>He was lying when he said that Xie nianqing was in seclusion.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. He slowly forced himself to calm down and continued to read.</p><p>Next, he saw a few images in succession.</p><p>Suddenly, many people who did not look like they were from the Tianyu demonic sect appeared on the screen.</p><p>“The intentionless saber sect, it’s the people of the intentionless saber sect!”</p><p>After taking a closer look, Lu Ming realized that these were actually people from the intentionless saber sect.</p><p>The intentionless saber sect was actually hidden within the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Tianyu demonic sect had also joined evil spirit.</p><p>Chi Chi Chi …</p><p>At that moment, the destructive power was getting more and more violent. It directly broke through the obstruction of the array Dao laws. Even the space-time laws could not stop it and were slowly broken through.</p><p>A wisp of Lu Ming’s soul immediately retreated from Mo Yang’s soul. Then, the power of destruction drowned Mo Yang’s soul.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mo Yang held his head and screamed madly. He seemed to be in extreme pain as he struggled on the ground.</p><p>After a while, Mo Yang finally stopped struggling and passed out.</p><p>It was obvious that Mo Yang’s soul had been destroyed. Even if he woke up, he would still be an idiot.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly, his eyes filled with a shocking murderous intent.</p><p>According to the contents of the soul search, Xie nianqing should still be fine and not possessed.</p><p>However, the situation was ever-changing, and no one knew what would happen next. Every day that Xie nianqing stayed in the Tian Yu demon sect was an extra day of danger.</p><p>He had to save Xie nianqing.</p><p>It seemed that he had to take a break into the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>His cultivation was not enough, but he had the reincarnation halberd. He might have a chance.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lu Ming calmed himself down and walked to Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao’s side.</p><p>Qiu Hao was still holding onto the young lady’s body like an idiot.</p><p>AI!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh. It was a pity that they were one step too late. Otherwise, such a thing would not have happened.</p><p>“Yingying, let’s bring your big brother back to Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying nodded, and then softly said, ” brother, let’s go back to Dragon God Valley First. Miss Jiajia has passed away. We have to bury her!</p><p>“That’s right, brother Qiu, you have to pull yourself together!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Hao nodded and picked up the young lady’s body before standing up.</p><p>Although he had been severely injured, it was not a fatal injury. His Martial Emperor spiritual body was strong and his recovery ability was extremely strong. He could already move.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you!”</p><p>Qiu Hao glanced at Lu Ming, then carried the young lady’s body and walked forward.</p><p>“None of you can escape!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the distance.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>With a terrifying sound, a silver light streaked across the sky and approached at a terrifying speed. Before the sound even faded, the silver light had already arrived.</p><p>The silver light dispersed, and a figure appeared.</p><p>“Yin Zheng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and his eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>It was Yin Zheng, the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Yin Zheng, you’re following me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Hmph, I’m only sending people to keep an eye on you!”</p><p>Yin Zheng said coldly. He swept his gaze across the scene and his eyes landed on Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, hand over Emperor Cang’s legacy and treasures!”</p><p>“Yin Zheng, you followed me without permission and wanted me to hand over Emperor Cang’s treasures and inheritance. Aren’t you afraid that my master will find out?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley sneered but didn’t say anything.</p><p>or, after I give you Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, you can kill us to silence us? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said again.</p><p>“You don’t have a choice today!”</p><p>Yin Zheng’s voice was cold.</p><p>“Is that so?” I choose not to say!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>if you don’t tell me, you’ll all die. I’ll torture these two in front of you, step by step, so that they can’t die. If you still don’t tell me, I’ll have to learn from you and search your soul!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression darkened.</p><p>Yin Zheng, as the master of a Valley, how could you treat a disciple of Dragon God Valley like this? how despicable!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Cut the crap and hand it over!”</p><p>Yin Zheng shouted, greed flashing in his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and a white light flashed, keeping Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao into the mountain and river diagram. Then, Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps and dashed out like lightning.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>A silver light flashed on Yin Zheng’s body. He flew out like a Silver Dragon and caught up with Lu Ming in an instant. He threw a punch and a Silver Dragon flew out, pouncing toward Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Bubbles, who was on Lu Ming’s shoulder, opened a space-time Tunnel and Lu Ming stepped in.</p><p>“Space-time law? Break!”</p><p>Yin Zheng was shocked at first. Then, he roared and pushed his palms out with an overwhelming force. A huge Silver Dragon flew out with its fangs and claws bared. The dragon’s claws grabbed the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>The space-time Tunnel gave off a terrifying vibration and then exploded with a bang. Lu Ming had not crossed a long distance before he was directly shaken out of the space-time Tunnel.</p><p>Yin Zheng was too strong. He was an expert even among the great saints and his cultivation base was close to an absolute Saint. On the other hand, bubbles hadn’t broken through to the Saint realm. Although the spacetime laws were profound, they were far inferior to Yin Zheng’s. The spacetime tunnel was destroyed by Yin Zheng in an instant.</p><p>“Is this the legendary space-time spirit mouse? Lu Ming, you’re really blessed. No, it should be me who’s blessed because all of this will be mine soon!”</p><p>Yin Zheng laughed loudly, extremely pleased with himself.</p><p>“Master, Valley master!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly looked behind Yin Zheng and bowed slightly.</p><p>“Hehehe, Lu Ming, do you think I will believe such a low-level trick?”</p><p>Yin Zheng sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to divert his attention and escape. How was that possible?</p><p>now, hurry up and hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. Otherwise, you will die a miserable death. You should be well aware that whether you hand them over or not, you are dead. If you hand them over, I will let you suffer less pain!</p><p>Yin Zheng continued.</p><p>“I think you’re the one who’s dead!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. It did not come from Lu Ming but from behind Yin Zheng.</p><p>Yin Zheng’s body stiffened when he heard the voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
