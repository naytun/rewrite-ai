She sat in the pavilion without moving, but the Golden Crow fifth Prince vomited blood and retreated.</p><p>could that be the legendary sky illusion law?”</p><p>it’s possible. Otherwise, how could it have such power? the sky illusion law is a King path law, second only to the ten strongest laws. Luo Tianyi is a King body!</p><p>another King physique has appeared. Today, we’ve really entered an era of Kings contending for hegemony!</p><p>it’s not just the king physique. There are even a few sons of heaven in the heavenly Emperor City. Isn’t lu Ming the son of chaos?”</p><p>Sounds of discussion could be heard in the surroundings.</p><p>…..</p><p>“It should be one of the king path laws, the sky illusion law!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Under the ten ultimate maxims, there were some maxims that were extremely terrifying and powerful. They were not much weaker than the ten ultimate maxims. These maxims were known as the king path maxims.</p><p>This ‘King’ did not mean the king of martial Kings, but the king of laws.</p><p>The king amongst the myriad of laws. Those who controlled the king path laws were called King physiques.</p><p>Those who mastered the ten ultimate maxims were known as the Son of Heaven.</p><p>For example, Luo Xiang’s control of the laws of speed was a type of King path law.</p><p>Also, Long Chen’s law of extremity, the extreme of force, was also a kind of King path law. Phoenix Spirit’s law of unperishable flame was also a kind of King path law.</p><p>Now, he had seen another one, the sky illusion law.</p><p>The sky illusion nomological law could make people fall into an illusion without them knowing. Even if they were attacked in the illusion, their bodies would be injured. It was truly incomparably profound.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated illusions before, but it was much weaker than the sky illusion law.</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s soul power is definitely very powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated in his heart.</p><p>“Who else wants to come up?”</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Wan Pingyang stood up and landed on the Jade steps. He wanted to climb up the pavilion, but his outcome was the same as the fifth Prince of the Golden Crow. He spat out blood and retreated. He returned to his seat with a dark expression.</p><p>Following that, a few more heaven’s favorites went up. Some of them had terrifying cultivation and had actually reached the great sage, but it was useless. The result was the same. They all spat out blood and retreated.</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s cultivation was simply unfathomable.</p><p>“Anyone else?”</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled and looked around. When she saw Lu Ming, she nodded slightly at him.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, that sister seems to be interested in you. She’s hinting at you. Why don’t you go quickly!”</p><p>At the side, Pao Pao mumbled.</p><p>“You have sharp eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head and bubbles immediately revealed a look of enjoyment.</p><p>“However, it’s not a bad idea to go up and have a drink!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He stood up and took a step forward, landing on the Jade staircase.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze instantly fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re overestimating yourself. Other Supreme Saints can’t get on it. You’re just a bright Saint, and you want to get on?”</p><p>Wan tianbing seized the opportunity to mock him rudely.</p><p>you’re right. Wait a minute. Let’s see how he embarrasses himself!</p><p>Wan Pingyang continued.</p><p>The others shook their heads. Lu Ming was a bright Saint. How could he possibly step on it? he would probably be blasted down in a few minutes.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a nonchalant glance at Wan Pingyang and Wan tianbing. His disdainful voice rang out,” “You’re a piece of trash, do you think everyone else is like you?”</p><p>“Who are you calling trash?”</p><p>Wan Pingyang’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>“It’s whoever answered!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Hmph, you’re just trying to win with your words. Let’s see how you’re going to step on it.”</p><p>Wan Pingyang’s face darkened.</p><p>“Then open your dog eyes wide and watch!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward.</p><p>Lu Ming advanced step by step at a steady pace. Very soon, he was halfway up the Jade staircase. However, he did not slow down and continued to move forward at the same speed.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Wan Pingyang’s expression also changed.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move upwards and was close to the pavilion. Nothing happened.</p><p>“How could this be? Luo Tianyi didn’t even make a move!”</p><p>“Did Luo Tianyi deliberately let him go up?”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Someone shouted, finding it hard to accept.</p><p>He deliberately let Lu Ming go up. What did this mean?</p><p>Could it be that Luo Tianyi had taken a fancy to Lu Ming?</p><p>However, so many stronger geniuses had been blasted down by Luo Tianyi. Would Luo Tianyi be interested in Lu Ming?</p><p>However, the truth was right in front of their eyes. Lu Ming walked up step by step. Every step he took seemed to be stepping on the hearts of those geniuses.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen smiled faintly. Why would Luo Tianyi stop Lu Ming if he wanted to go up?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming took a step onto the pavilion. Many people’s hearts slapped a beat.</p><p>“Young master Lu, please take a seat!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi’s face showed a bright smile, and her clear voice rang out, which stunned many people.</p><p>“A Beauty’s invitation, it’s not beautiful!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and sat down on a stool that was next to Luo Tian’s. Their bodies were almost leaning against each other. Then, Luo Tianyi poured a cup of tea for Lu Ming. Lu Ming picked it up, took a deep breath, and exclaimed,”It smells so good!”</p><p>He didn’t know if it was the fragrance of tea or the fragrance of people.</p><p>However, the eyes of the young geniuses below the stage were red with envy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what right do you have to sit on top? get down!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared. He was filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred. He wished that the person he was looking for was him.</p><p>He could not figure out why Luo Tianyi did not attack Lu Ming. Could it be that she had taken a fancy to Lu Ming? at the thought of this, he was so angry that he went crazy, and the fire of jealousy burned.</p><p>“Whether I’m qualified or not, is it something you can say?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at Wan Pingyang, then turned to Luo Tianyi and said,” the fairy is so beautiful. Even Lu Ming’s heart can’t help but palpitate!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming slowly leaned toward Luo Tian.</p><p>“Young master is too kind!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi was still smiling, as if she was not angry at all.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, under the ‘angry gaze’ of the crowd, he picked up the cup that Luo Tianyi had drunk from and finished it in one gulp.</p><p>“The tea that fairy has drunk is so fragrant, haha!”</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>This action was already very frivolous. It was equivalent to flirting with Luo Tianyi in front of everyone.</p><p>Many people thought that Luo Tianyi would fly into a rage, but the result surprised them.</p><p>Luo Tianyi was still smiling as if she didn’t mind at all. She said,” “Young master, if you don’t mind, you can always come and drink tea with me!”</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Many people were roaring in their hearts. What was going on? Could it be that Luo Tianyi had really taken a fancy to Lu Ming? Or did Lu Ming already have an ‘affair’ with Luo Tianyi?</p><p>When they thought of these two points, many people felt terrible. Some of them were even roaring in their hearts, why wasn’t this person me?</p><p>Even the other nine saintesses of the Jade Lake were stunned.</p><p>Based on their understanding of Luo Tianyi, if anyone dared to do that to her, they would be crippled immediately. There was no second outcome.</p><p>But now, Luo Tianyi did not seem to be angry at all..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
