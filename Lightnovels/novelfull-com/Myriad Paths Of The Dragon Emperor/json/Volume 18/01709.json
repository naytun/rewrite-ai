Each of them was extremely terrifying as they charged towards the sky god sect’s sect master.</p><p>The sect master of the sky god sect had a solemn expression on his face. He circulated his nomological laws and fought with the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>...</p><p>Dragon roars reverberated in the air as the spears pierced through the air. The battle was becoming more and more intense.</p><p>What was shocking was that after more than ten moves, the sect master of the tianshen sect was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>“You, also come in!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice rang out from the endless sword radiance. A true dragon roared and pounced towards the sky demon sect master.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master actually wanted to fight one against two, fighting both the sky demon sect master and the sky god sect master.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly. Demonic light shot into the sky, covering half of the world.</p><p>She waved her hands, and countless black demonic lotuses appeared, charging towards the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Nine appearances of Cloud Dragon!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice rang out again as nine true dragons condensed.</p><p>Each of these true dragons was formed by countless sword lights. They were extremely terrifying and each of them had earth-shattering power.</p><p>The three experts fought madly, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>Countless people gasped. The cloud Dragon Valley master was too powerful. He fought two sect Masters alone and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>How many people in the Azure continent had such combat strength?</p><p>Among everyone, Yin Zheng’s expression was the ugliest.</p><p>He clenched his fists tightly and his body trembled. His face was pale and his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had never imagined that the cloud Dragon Valley master had reached such a realm. It seemed that the cloud Dragon Valley master had not used much power when he had fought with him in the past. Otherwise, the cloud Dragon Valley master would have been able to kill him with a single sword.</p><p>damn it, this guy has been low-key for so many years, and his strength has actually reached such a terrifying realm!</p><p>Yin Zheng roared in his heart.</p><p>The experts of the Tianyu demonic sect and the tianshen sect were also shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming was also very surprised.</p><p>Although he had guessed that the cloud Dragon Valley master was an absolute Saint, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s strength still exceeded his imagination.</p><p>The battle continued. The three of them fought until they were high up in the sky. Only endless light could be seen, but the three of them could not be seen at all.</p><p>After fighting for a while, there was a terrible explosion. The light dissipated and the figures of three people appeared.</p><p>The sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect stood side by side, their faces extremely gloomy.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master held a long sword in his hand as his fighting spirit soared.</p><p>At this moment, the cloud Dragon Valley master was no longer a gentle old man. Instead, he was an expert who ruled the world. His sword glowed with a cold light that traveled 90000 miles.</p><p>“You can’t stop me from killing whoever I want to kill!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said, full of confidence.</p><p>The expression of the sect master of the heavenly God sect was the ugliest.</p><p>If he gave the order to deal with the family members of the Dragon God Valley disciples, the cloud Dragon Valley master could kill the other disciples of the tianshen sect.</p><p>They could not stop him. The cloud Dragon Valley master was too powerful.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a loud explosion sounded in the sky. A huge warship flew over at high speed and stopped not far away. Then, a large number of figures flew out from the warship.</p><p>Each of them was dressed in green robes and emanated a poisonous aura.</p><p>The sect masters of the sky demon sect and the God of heaven sect were overjoyed. The experts of the Yu Du sect had arrived!</p><p>The one leading the desire poison sect was an old man, the sect master of the desire poison sect.</p><p>“It’s really lively today!”</p><p>The sect master of the desire poison sect stepped forward and stood together with the sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the sky demon sect. Their auras were overbearing.</p><p>“You guys are really going too far!”</p><p>absolute Saint! the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley stepped forward and appeared beside the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley. A terrifying aura burst out. He was also an absolute Saint.</p><p>The five absolute Saints faced each other in the sky, and their auras were extremely oppressive.</p><p>Everyone was watching nervously.</p><p>The sect Masters of the three great sects seemed to be discussing through voice transmission. After a while, the sect master of the God of heaven sect said,”You can protect Lu Ming for now, but you can’t protect him forever. Disciples of the deity sect, listen up. Retreat a hundred miles, set up camp, and besiege Dragon God Valley. Once Lu Ming comes out, or the other disciples of Dragon God Valley come out, take him down!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The experts of the heavenly God sect received the order.</p><p>disciples of the Tian Yu demon sect, listen up. Retreat a hundred miles and set up a camp …</p><p>“Desire poison sect’s disciples. hear my order …”</p><p>The sect Masters of the Tianyu demon sect and the Yu Du sect gave orders one after another. They ordered the experts of the two sects to retreat a hundred miles and surround Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The powerhouses of the three major sects retreated slowly. Then, the sect Masters of the three major sects cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and retreated as well.</p><p>The valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley looked at each other with worry in their eyes.</p><p>disciples of Dragon God Valley, listen up. Send experts to station around Dragon God Valley in case of enemy sneak attacks!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master ordered.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you should go back. You don’t have to think too much about this matter. They can’t do anything to you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master appeared beside Lu Ming and said gently.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked towards the sky cloud Valley. However, he clenched his fists tightly and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>This trap was difficult to break!</p><p>Even if he were to hand over Emperor Cang’s storage ring, the Tian Shen sect and the other sects would not let the matter rest. That was because it was rumored that he had also obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance.</p><p>But in fact, he didn’t get it at all, so he definitely couldn’t hand it over.</p><p>This news must have been spread by evil spirit. Evil spirit knew that Lu Ming did not receive the inheritance and would not hand it over. Therefore, the various sects in the Azure continent would definitely clash.</p><p>No one would believe Lu Ming even if he explained.</p><p>strength. I’m still too weak. I must enter the sage realm as soon as possible!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was firm.</p><p>However, entering the sage realm was a huge hurdle. Without enough accumulation, it was too difficult to cross in a short time.</p><p>After returning to the sky cloud Valley, Lu Ming fell into deep thought.</p><p>“I have to give it a shot!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had thought of a way to enter the sage realm in a short time.</p><p>That was to merge the main body and the secondary body into one and merge them back into one.</p><p>The Twin forbidden spell mentioned that the main body and the secondary body could be fused again, but once fused, it would be impossible to cultivate the secondary body in the future.</p><p>This was a great loss. With a secondary body, he could do a lot of things. Moreover, a secondary body was like having an extra life. If the main body was killed, he could still survive with the secondary body.</p><p>But now, if he wanted to enter the Saint realm in a short time, he had to merge the main body and the second body.</p><p>With the accumulation of the main body and the second body, the two combined was enough to reach the Saint realm.</p><p>In the current situation, it would be difficult to even protect himself if he did not have the cultivation of a Saint.</p><p>If he reached the Saint realm, his combat strength would increase even more.</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>Lu Ming made up his mind and entered the mountain and river diagram. He came to the foot of the path-understanding ancient tree and sat cross-legged under it. The two of them looked at each other and then sat opposite each other. They cast the forbidden spell of twin and began to merge.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
