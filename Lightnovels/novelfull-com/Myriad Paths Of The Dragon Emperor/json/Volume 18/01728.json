They slashed out terrifying saber lights towards the Ice Dragon old ancestor.</p><p>...</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A black and white sword Qi cut through the void and slashed at the tower master of blood demon tower.</p><p>Then, with a loud roar, a divine Sun Lion appeared. The valley master of Ice Dragon Valley also appeared and joined the battle.</p><p>Although the deity sect and the other major sects had previously discussed about destroying Dragon God Valley, they couldn’t just leave them in the lurch. If the experts of the deity sect, jiuxiao sword sect, and evil moon sect all died here, the remaining forces in the Azure region would be greatly weakened. This was exactly what evil spirit wanted.</p><p>They had to join forces to deal with evil spirit.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Many absolute Saints flew into the sky and started fighting.</p><p>The battle between absolute Saints was too terrifying. The overflowing Qi could kill great saints and bright Saints, not to mention those below the Saint realm. They all had disciples below. If they fought with all their strength below, the disciples of both sides would die.</p><p>The absolute Saints flew into the sky and fought. The others below were fighting, and screams kept coming.</p><p>“Little Qing, it’s in that demon mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area. According to the images he saw in Mo Yang’s memories, his gaze landed on the place where many sects had gathered. Xie nianqing was imprisoned under the demon mountain.</p><p>The soul of evil Spirit’s blood demon master was also below.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward.</p><p>He had a Saint weapon around him and a sword in his hand. With one slash, he killed a Saint of the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Then, he killed another Saint of the Yu Du sect with one strike.</p><p>After killing a few people, Lu Ming did not linger in the battle. He used the thundering wind steps and his figure flickered as he headed towards the demon mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>With a loud roar, a middle-aged brawny man charged at Lu Ming with a demonic blade in his hand. His aura was extremely shocking.</p><p>This was a great saint. He was even more powerful than the burly elder who had fought with Lu Ming previously.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sword and slashed with all his might.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The other party’s saber gleam directly crushed Lu Ming’s sword gleam and slashed at Lu Ming’s combat sword. Lu Ming felt an unstoppable force surging towards him. He retreated continuously, his qi and blood churning, and a mouthful of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Great sage great mastery!</p><p>This was an expert in the great sage great mastery realm. He was extremely powerful and Lu Ming was no match for him.</p><p>cripple him first. After the battle is over, we’ll force out his secret!</p><p>A few more people appeared in front of Lu Ming. They were all great saints. One of them was the burly elder who had fought with Lu Ming earlier. His eyes were cold.</p><p>There were a total of four great saints. Lu Ming could not possibly defeat them.</p><p>The four great saints ‘auras exploded and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The Holy weapons around him flew into his body and disappeared. A large halberd appeared in his hand.</p><p>Reincarnation halberd!</p><p>Zhen Yuan poured into the reincarnation halberd. A beam of energy was activated, and a layer of black light appeared on the halberd.</p><p>“You still want to kill us? die!”</p><p>The middle-aged man slashed at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the reincarnation halberd and slashed with all his might.</p><p>With a clang, the battle saber in the middle-aged man’s hand was directly cut into two by the reincarnation halberd. The reincarnation halberd did not stop. With one slash, the middle-aged man’s body was split in half from the middle.</p><p>A great sage expert had fallen.</p><p>The other three Supreme Saints were almost scared to death.</p><p>That was a great saint, but he was killed by Lu Ming’s halberd. Even the demonic blade of the great saint weapon was cut in half. How could this be?</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>There was only one thought in their minds, and that was to retreat. The further away they were from Lu Ming, the better.</p><p>“It’s too late to leave now. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and slashed with the reincarnation halberd. A dark light flashed and the three great saints ‘bodies stiffened. Their eyes popped out and they looked horrified. Then, their bodies were torn into pieces and their souls were destroyed.</p><p>Three Supreme Saints were killed in one move.</p><p>The other people nearby were scared out of their wits. They retreated frantically and kept their distance from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and continued to walk toward the demon mountain.</p><p>Along the way, there were hundreds of people from the intentionless saber sect and evil spirit sect who were in the middle. They were directly killed by Lu Ming’s halberd, and hundreds of people were killed in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming was bathed in blood, looking like a demonic god as he came to the demonic mountain.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the reincarnation halberd with both hands and raised it high. The reincarnation halberd enlarged rapidly and then hacked down heavily at the demon mountain.</p><p>This halberd was like the halberd of a God. As it slashed down, the huge Palace on the demon mountain directly exploded.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Under the reincarnation halberd, the towering demon mountain was split into two with a loud noise.</p><p>Huge rocks flew everywhere, as if doomsday had arrived.</p><p>The demon mountain was split open, revealing the underground cave under the mountain.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>&Nbsp; a sharp sound reverberated through the sky. In the underground cave, blood mist gathered and formed a giant face.</p><p>Xie nianqing sat there, motionless, as if he was unaware of what was happening outside.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He did not expect to see Xie nianqing again in such a place and under such circumstances.</p><p>the Tian Yu demonic sect and evil spirit cult must be destroyed and killed!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a layer of blood-red, and his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! a loud shout was heard. An elder in a black robe rushed out of the underground cave. Demonic Qi surged from his body, and his aura was extremely terrifying.</p><p>This was an absolute Saint!</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect had specially called for a Supreme Saint to guard this underground cave.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The giant face formed by the blood demon King shrieked.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect’s absolute saint’s demonic aura soared to the sky as he clawed at Lu Ming. The terrifying demonic claw was larger than a mountain.</p><p>Even an expert in the great sage Great Perfection realm would be killed by this claw, let alone a Ming Sage.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression did not change. He was still cold and indifferent. He stepped forward and said in a cold voice,”You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>The reincarnation halberd enlarged and slashed out. The demonic claw formed by the Tianyu demonic sect’s absolute Saint was directly split apart. The reincarnation halberd did not stop and continued to slash at the Tianyu demonic sect’s absolute Saint.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The sky demon sect’s absolute saint’s eyes widened. He realized that he had been completely locked onto by the reincarnation halberd. It was as if there was a reincarnation power that made it impossible for him to Dodge. He could only take it head-on.</p><p>He roared and struck out with his palms. In an instant, he struck out hundreds of palm prints. The hundreds of palm prints merged and formed a giant demonic palm print, which smashed towards the reincarnation halberd.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. As the reincarnation halberd slashed down, the demonic palm print collapsed. The reincarnation halberd slashed at the Tian Yu demon sect’s absolute Saint with unparalleled power.</p><p>The absolute Saint let out a blood-curdling scream that reverberated throughout the entire Tian Yu demon sect. Then, he was cut in half by Lu Ming, and his soul was annihilated.</p><p>An absolute Saint had died!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
