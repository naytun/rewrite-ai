However, for some reason, Mo Yang had found out about this, and in his rage, he had wanted to kill Qiu Hao and the female disciple.</p><p>Qiu Hao and the female disciples of the Tianyu demonic sect had arrived early. Qiu Hao had brought the other party to Dragon God Valley, but he was chased by Mo Yang. Not long ago, he had fled into the sunset Mountains and sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yingying for help.</p><p>...</p><p>With Qiu Ying Ying’s status in Dragon God Valley, how could she possibly find an expert that was too strong? Mo Yang had been at the third stage of the half-Saint realm during the last treasure fixing assembly, and he must have brought experts with him. If he had to ask for help, he would at least have to ask for the help of a Saint.</p><p>How could Qiu Ying Ying invite a Saint? she could only think of Lu Ming, and in her panic, she went to find him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current speed was astonishing. He brought Qiu Ying Ying with him and streaked across the sky like a stream of light. They headed towards the sunset Mountains. In just a few hours, they were close to the sunset Mountains.</p><p>According to Qiu Yingying, her parents had made a destiny talisman for her and Qiu Hao since they were young. With the destiny talisman, they could sense each other’s presence within a certain range. This was also to allow the siblings to take care of each other when they were out in the world.</p><p>At the same time, in a Valley in the Luo Xia mountains, Qiu Hao and a beautiful young woman were holding hands and looking at the sky with terrible expressions.</p><p>In the air, three figures stood in the air and looked at the two of them with cold expressions.</p><p>The person in the lead was Mo Yang, and behind him were two elders. Their auras were strong, and their Saint might permeated the air. They were clearly two Saint realm experts.</p><p>senior brother Mo Yang, qiuhao and I are truly in love. Please let us go!</p><p>The young woman begged.</p><p>shut up, you b * tch. So many Devil’s doctrine brothers have been pursuing you, but you’ve always rejected them. Why did you have to hang out with this trash from Dragon God Valley? you’re simply courting death!</p><p>Mo Yang coldly berated.</p><p>senior brother Mo Yang, when I first met Qiu Hao, there was no conflict between the Tianyu demonic sect and Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The young woman explained.</p><p>shut up! You’re just like that b * tch Xie nianqing. Both of you deserve to die!</p><p>Mo Yang’s face turned even colder, especially when he mentioned Xie nianqing. His eyes burned with anger and evil.</p><p>“You … You’re not allowed to insult the Holy maiden!”</p><p>The young woman said.</p><p>as expected, you’re Xie nianqing’s servant. You two are the same. Today, I’ll make you wish you were dead!</p><p>Mo Yang descended from the sky, and his powerful aura pressed down on Qiu Hao and the other man.</p><p>Qiu Hao’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>what a piece of trash. I don’t understand why a b * tch like you would take a fancy to this piece of trash!</p><p>Mo Yang looked at Qiu Hao with disdain and reached out his hand to grab him.</p><p>“Qiuhao, run!”</p><p>The young woman pushed Qiu Hao away, then unleashed her demonic power and struck Mo Yang with her palm.</p><p>However, the difference between her and Mo Yang was too great. Her Palm Power was directly crushed by Mo Yang, and she was caught by the demonic claws that he had condensed.</p><p>“Jiajia, Mo Yang, let go of Jiajia!”</p><p>die! Qiu Hao roared. With bloodshot eyes, he charged at Mo Yang like a wild beast.</p><p>“Trash, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Mo Yang shouted coldly. Demonic Qi gathered and formed a demonic spear. It shot out like lightning and pierced Qiu Hao’s chest, nailing him to the ground.</p><p>Qiu Hao spat out a mouthful of blood. His cultivation was sealed by the demonic Qi and he could not move at all.</p><p>“Qiuhao!”</p><p>The young woman exclaimed.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Mo Yang’s palm landed on the young woman’s face, and a palm print immediately appeared.</p><p>The young woman’s body began to struggle violently. Mo Yang’s eyes burned with a fiery light.</p><p>The evil fire in his eyes grew stronger as he stared at the young woman and said coldly, ” you b * tch, as Xie nianqing’s maidservant, you actually look like her. Although you’re not as pretty as that b * tch, you can still play with her, hahaha!</p><p>“Animal, let her go, let her go!”</p><p>Mo Yang! Qiu Hao cried out, his eyes filled with rage. He wanted nothing more than to burn Mo Yang into ashes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Mo Yang waved his hand, and beams of demonic light pierced through Qiu Hao’s limbs, pinning him to the ground. He said coldly, ” you piece of trash, how dare you seduce the disciple of my Tian Yu demon sect. Now, I’ll let you watch. Watch as I play with the person you love. Hahaha!</p><p>As Mo Yang spoke, he became even more excited. He reached out his palm and reached out to the young woman.</p><p>The two old men looked on coldly, as if they were already used to it.</p><p>They were Mo Yang’s trusted aides, and this was not the first time Mo Yang had done something like this. They had seen it many times.</p><p>Qiu Hao, we’ll meet again in our next life!</p><p>The young woman looked at Qiu Hao sadly, and her tears flowed down like a broken string of pearls.</p><p>“B * tch, what are you doing?”</p><p>die! Mo Yang also sensed that something was wrong and roared. However, it was already too late. A layer of green qi spread across the young woman’s face and quickly covered her entire body. In just a few breaths, the young woman’s life force was completely extinguished.</p><p>“B * tch, you hid a poison pill in your mouth!”</p><p>die! Mo Yang roared. The young woman had actually hidden a poison pill in her mouth. At the critical moment, she bit through the poison pill. It was a terrifying poison, and in an instant, the young woman’s life was extinguished.</p><p>Mo Yang was extremely displeased. His mood, which he had finally managed to get, had been interrupted just like that.</p><p>He casually threw the young woman’s body to the side.</p><p>“Jiajia!”</p><p>Qiu Hao roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>“I’ll leave this kid to you. Make him regret being born into this world!”</p><p>Mo Yang instructed an old man.</p><p>yes, don’t worry, young master. He will become a dog very soon!</p><p>One of the old men smiled eerily and walked towards Qiu Hao.</p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifying sound pierced through the air. A Black bolt of lightning shot towards the old man at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The old man’s body trembled instinctively. He wanted to Dodge, but it was too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A long black spear pierced through the old man’s dantian, sliding him on the ground for thousands of meters, leaving a deep ditch on the ground.</p><p>The old man’s eyes were wide open as he stared at the sky in front of him. There were two young figures stepping on the air.</p><p>One of them was a young man with long hair that fluttered in the wind. The killing intent he exuded was so terrifying that it made people feel as if they had entered the winter.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming!”</p><p>The old man spat out these two words with great difficulty. Then, his head tilted to the side and he breathed his last.</p><p>The figures of the young man and woman were naturally Lu Ming and Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“Big brother!”</p><p>When Qiu Ying Ying saw Qiu Hao’s miserable state, she cried out in shock, tears welling up in her eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>no! Mo Yang screamed in horror, his face pale.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
