However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was still too weak. He could not withstand the palm print and collapsed.</p><p>However, after continuous resistance, the other party’s palm print had been weakened by a large extent. The remaining power of the palm continued to blast toward Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated while resisting with all his might. More than a hundred Saint weapons floated in front of him. A layer of dragon scales appeared on the surface of his body. The Laws of Chaos flowed on the Dragon scales.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palm force swept across and crushed everything. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he retreated a thousand meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>A cold glint flashed in the eyes of the elder from the WAN family. His palm strike did not kill Lu Ming, but only injured him. He slashed out with his palm. This time, it was a ray of sword light that shocked the nine Heavens and seemed to be able to break through everything.</p><p>At this moment, a Phoenix’s cry rang out. A ray of light flew out and blocked the sword light.</p><p>The WAN family’s experts looked at Phoenix Palace and said coldly, ” “What, is Phoenix Palace trying to stop me?”</p><p>nonsense. The Golden Crow clan is shameless, but the WAN family is even more shameless. The younger generation can’t win against Lu Ming, so you directly attack the older generation. How despicable!</p><p>Mu Qingxue directly cursed.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s expert berated.</p><p>“Shut up? You’re despicable and shameless, yet you don’t allow others to say it!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue called out.</p><p>The power behind mu Qingxue was also very powerful, so he didn’t fear the WAN family at all.</p><p>“Qingxue’s right. A month ago, Lu Ming challenged Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow to a battle in front of everyone. This was a battle between the younger generation, and it was a battle of life and death. But now, not only did you save Wan tianbing, but you also attacked Lu Ming. Isn’t this too much?”</p><p>Huang Ling continued.</p><p>it’s not just too much, it’s simply shameless. Just now, when Wan tianbing had the upper hand, he shouted to kill Lu Ming. When Wan tianbing was no match for him, the elders came to save him. They even attacked Lu Ming directly. This is the WAN family’s style. I’ve really learned something!</p><p>Long Chen said coldly.</p><p>After being ridiculed by a few juniors, the WAN family’s expert’s face turned dark and extremely ugly.</p><p>After that, the WAN family’s powerhouse looked at Lu Ming and chided, ” “Brat, hand over that absolute Saint weapon, battleaxe, and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>“Spare me? Hahaha, what a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and stepped forward in the air, facing the WAN family’s powerhouse. I never thought that a Holy Land force like the WAN family would be so shameless. How can such a force be called a Holy Land force? what a joke!</p><p>today, I’m going to fight with Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow. If I’m no match for them, I’ll just be killed. But if they’re no match for me, you have no right to interfere. Besides, that battleaxe is my trophy. What right do you have to take it back? ”</p><p>impudent! How dare you insult our Wan family? you’re courting death!</p><p>The WAN family’s powerhouse’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He took a step forward, and a terrifying aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, an elder from the Phoenix Palace also stepped forward and blocked the WAN family’s experts with his aura.</p><p>“Is Phoenix Palace determined to go against the WAN family?”</p><p>The old man of the WAN family said coldly.</p><p>“Do you think Phoenix Palace will be afraid?”</p><p>An old woman from the Phoenix Palace smiled faintly.</p><p>haha, everyone here, in my opinion, it’s better to avoid the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan in the future. It’s best not to spar with them. If you lose, you’ll be humiliated and killed by the other party. If you win, the other party’s elders will immediately rush over to kill you!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud with a strong sense of sarcasm.</p><p>that’s right. In my opinion, in the future, the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan’s younger generation should stay at home and not come out. They can’t afford to lose at all!</p><p>Mu Qingxue called out.</p><p>The WAN family and the Golden Crow clan’s faces became gloomier and gloomier.</p><p>“Brat, hand over that wing and we’ll forget about today’s matter!”</p><p>At this moment, a powerful being from the Golden Crow race stepped out and looked at Lu Ming with his golden eyes.</p><p>what a joke. That’s my trophy too. I’ll roast the Golden crow’s wings tonight. They should be very acted and saved the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing.</p><p>Now, they were asking him for his spoils of war. How could Lu Ming hand them over?</p><p>delicious!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>He was unhappy, extremely unhappy.</p><p>This was an unfair battle. Just as he said, if he was defeated, he would definitely be killed by his opponent. However, when his opponent was defeated, the elder figure of his opponent directly acted and saved the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing.</p><p>Now, they were asking him for his spoils of war. How could Lu Ming hand them over?</p><p>“Impudent, you’re courting death!”</p><p>All the powerful cultivators of the Golden Crow clan were filled with killing intent. They stepped forward and glared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>OWW …</p><p>In the sky, there were the cries of Dragons and elephants. Long Chen stepped through the void and came. Behind him were the experts of the divine elephant sect, who were closing in on the experts of the Golden Crow clan.</p><p>Your divine elephant sect also wants to interfere? ”</p><p>An expert from the Golden Crow race said, his eyes flashing with solemness.</p><p>The divine elephant sect’s power was extremely terrifying. Even the Golden Crow clan had to be wary.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Long Chen’s answer was simple, but it showed his attitude.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The powerhouses of the Phoenix Palace stepped into the air and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The experts from the four sides began to confront each other.</p><p>All around, the other cultivators looked on excitedly. Could it be that the four powerful forces were going to war today?</p><p>elder, Lu Ming is so talented. He’s worth befriending. Moreover, Lu Ming and I are old friends!</p><p>Ye Dong sent a message to a warrior of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>The eyes of the Thunder God sect’s elder flickered. Then, he nodded and transmitted a message to the other Thunder God sect’s elders. Then, with a flash of lightning, a few elders of the Thunder God sect appeared near the WAN family’s experts. A terrifying aura pressed towards the WAN family’s people.</p><p>“Wan family, golden Crow clan, you’ve gone too far today!”</p><p>An old man from the Thunder God sect said.</p><p>This made the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan’s faces even uglier.</p><p>“The Thunder God sect is also going to interfere?”</p><p>An expert from the WAN family spoke.</p><p>the battles between the younger generation are the matters of the younger generation. If there are no battles between geniuses, how can they grow? the older generation can not interfere. This is an unwritten rule in the world of martial Dao. If everyone is like you, how would the younger generation dare to go out and train? ”</p><p>if the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan can do this, then the other forces can do the same. Then, wouldn’t all the younger generation disciples be slaughtered by the older generation? ”</p><p>An elder of the Thunder God sect said.</p><p>Although the voice of the Thunder God sect’s elder was calm, it contained killing intent. His intention was obvious.</p><p>if the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan can do this, then other forces can do the same. Unless the disciples of the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan stay together in the future, they will also be killed.</p><p>Without the new blood of the younger generation, any force would be destroyed.</p><p>The experts of the WAN family and the Golden Crow race looked very gloomy.</p><p>“Alright, let’s forget about today’s matter!”</p><p>An expert from the WAN family flicked his sleeves and looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze. don’t think that just because you defeated Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow, you can become the leader of the younger generation. The great saints of the ancient Moon Holy Land have all gone to heaven Emperor City, but they will be back soon. At that time, someone from the WAN family will kill you. Let’s go!</p><p>After that, the people of the WAN family stepped into the air and left the place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
