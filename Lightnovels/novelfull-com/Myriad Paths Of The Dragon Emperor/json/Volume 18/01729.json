This was especially so for the people from the sky demon sect and the Yu Du sect. They were almost scared to death.</p><p>An absolute Saint was killed by Lu Ming’s halberd.</p><p>...</p><p>How did Lu Ming have such powerful strength?</p><p>“Damn it, damn it! How can this little bastard control such a terrifying power?”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect was the most shocked. He kept screaming in his heart, and his face was twisted.</p><p>hahaha, good kill. Evil Spirit’s remnants are destined to be destroyed again!</p><p>The valley master laughed, and his sword light was like a dragon, forcing an evil spirit absolute Saint to retreat.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The blood demon master’s giant face also screamed.</p><p>“Blood demon King, I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the reincarnation halberd and charged at the blood demon Queen.</p><p>The reincarnation halberd could kill anyone below the Emperor level. Although the blood demon King was an Emperor level expert at his peak, he was only left with a wisp of soul, so he could still be killed.</p><p>damn it, a bunch of trash. I can only take over his body now!</p><p>The blood demon master roared and turned into a ray of blood light, rushing into Xie nianqing’s forehead.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he rushed towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, wake up!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, but it was useless. Xie nianqing did not wake up.</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing’s body was covered in a layer of blood light. Her body trembled slightly and her face showed pain.</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely anxious. Clearly, the blood demon King was trying to possess Xie nianqing. He wanted to destroy Xie nianqing’s spiritual will and replace him.</p><p>Lu Ming would never let such a thing happen.</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. He took a step forward and activated the array Dao law. Countless runes appeared on the ground.</p><p>Runes were not inscriptions, they were of a higher level. Only those who had comprehended the power of laws could release them.</p><p>A large array enveloped Lu Ming and he sat down cross-legged. The space between his brows glowed and a small person appeared. It was Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul rushed to Xie nianqing’s glabella and entered it.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s soul appeared in a vast land. This place was Xie nianqing’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming entered, he saw Xie nianqing’s figure.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing was surrounded by a cloud of blood-red mist.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and rushed over.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure wasn’t his soul. He hadn’t broken through to the Saint plane yet, so he hadn’t condensed his soul. It was his spiritual will.</p><p>One’s spiritual will could project a physical form in one’s sea of consciousness. It was just like how Lu Ming could project a physical form in his own sea of consciousness a long time ago. However, it was impossible for his soul to enter other people’s sea of consciousness like Lu Ming.</p><p>Once one’s spiritual will broke through to the Saint realm, it would form a soul.</p><p>If the blood demon King refined Xie nianqing’s spiritual will, it would be equivalent to Xie nianqing disappearing from the world.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed. He did not expect Lu Ming to come to her sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Blood demon King, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and rushed toward the blood demon King. With a swing of his palm, the law of chaos circulated and slashed at the blood demon King’s soul.</p><p>Nomological laws were grasped after one had comprehended them. They borrowed the laws of heaven and earth and not one’s own energy. Therefore, the soul could also use the laws.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the blood demon Queen shouted coldly and condensed into a human form. It was the form of an old woman. She stretched out her withered claws and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck the blood demon King’s Claw. He immediately felt a terrifying force surge over, as if it was going to tear his arm apart.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure retreated rapidly. The chaos laws circulated continuously and finally obliterated this force.</p><p>Although the blood demon King was only a wisp of his soul, he was an Emperor-level existence at his peak. His Foundation was too strong, and Lu Ming could not match him at all.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming’s soul force was already equivalent to a Supreme Saint, it was useless.</p><p>“Brat, not only will you not be able to save this little girl today, even you will have to stay here!”</p><p>The blood demon Queen sneered and floated toward Lu Ming. Her withered claws continued to claw at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Godly sword technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He circulated the divine sword technique. His entire body turned into a sword, a sword of the soul, and slashed at the blood demon King.</p><p>it’s actually a soul-destroying divine sword technique. It’s a pity that your soul power is too weak!</p><p>The blood demon Queen sneered. Her claws grabbed the soul spirit battle sword that Lu Ming had transformed into. A sound of metal clashing was heard and the soul spirit battle sword was sent flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The soul spirit sword transformed back into Lu Ming. In a flash, Lu Ming appeared beside Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Little Qing, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing worriedly.</p><p>“I’m fine. Lu Ming, why are you here? leave quickly, leave this place quickly!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said anxiously.</p><p>silly girl, what nonsense are you saying? if you’re in danger, why would I leave? if I have to die today, I’ll die with you!</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice full of tenderness.</p><p>“Then I’ll send you on your way and let you two be a pair of mandarin ducks sharing the same fate!”</p><p>The blood demon Queen sneered and attacked the two of them, clawing at them.</p><p>“This is my sea of consciousness. Get out!”</p><p>Xie nianqing shouted. Her spiritual will glowed, and a terrifying fluctuation spread toward the blood demon master.</p><p>The evil spirit discipline King’s eyes revealed a grave expression. His two claws continuously struck out, breaking that invisible fluctuation.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to possess someone. Just like Xie nianqing said, this was her sea of consciousness.</p><p>In her sea of consciousness, Xie nianqing was able to unleash a terrifying power to destroy foreign souls.</p><p>Therefore, the blood demon master had always wanted to devour and refine more souls to strengthen his own soul before he began to possess Xie nianqing.</p><p>But now, she was forced to start the possession in advance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cast the divine sword technique and transformed into a divine sword. He cooperated with Xie nianqing to fight against the blood demon master.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle outside was getting more and more intense.</p><p>A large number of experts had fallen here forever, their blood staining the entire demon mountain.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect looked anxious when he saw Lu Ming’s soul enter Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>“You guys, go and kill Lu Ming. Hurry!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shouted.</p><p>A few great saints immediately pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>With a long roar, the sword light broke through the sky and two Supreme Saints were killed instantly.</p><p>With a flash of sword-light, the cloud Dragon Valley master appeared beside Lu Ming, holding his sword to block the attack.</p><p>kill! We must kill Lu Ming and let the Shakyamuni successfully possess him!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shrieked.</p><p>All of this involved her future. If the blood demon King succeeded, she would have a chance to become a great emperor in the future. She must not be ruined by Lu Ming.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect used all his strength to force his opponent to retreat before charging towards the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>At the same time, the other two absolute Saints also rushed toward the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>At that moment, two more absolute Saints appeared on evil Spirit’s side. Evil spirit had the advantage of absolute Saints.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
