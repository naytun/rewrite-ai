I just met an ant. I’ll find an opportunity to solve it myself!</p><p>The Golden Crow tenth Prince said.</p><p>The Golden Crow ninth Crown Prince nodded and didn’t say much.</p><p>Xu Ran, it’s you. Hehe, I didn’t expect a waste like you would come to the Jade Lake.</p><p>Suddenly, a contemptuous voice rang out behind Lu Ming and the group.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran turned around and saw a young man in a purple robe. He had his hands behind his back and was looking at Xu Ran with contempt.</p><p>“Tuoba Fei, you’re here too!”</p><p>Xu Ran’s face darkened.</p><p>“Of course I’m here. I’m destined to be The Guardian of the Jade Lake. But you, a piece of trash who doesn’t even have a heavenly spirit body, also came to the Jade Lake. It’s really like a lazy toad that wants to eat swan meat. Why don’t you take a piss and look at yourself!”</p><p>Tuoba Fei sneered and his contempt grew.</p><p>Xu Ran’s face turned red. He wanted to refute, but his talent was far inferior to the other party’s, so he couldn’t.</p><p>“Xu Ran, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xu Ran.</p><p>this person is a heaven’s favorite from an Emperor-ranked force. He’s close to blood jade Palace, and the two forces often have conflicts!</p><p>Xu Ran gave a simple explanation.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately understood. It was obvious that blood jade Palace and Tuoba Fei’s forces had a grudge against each other. Now that they had met, Tuoba Fei would naturally actively attack Xu Ran.</p><p>“What’s wrong? A piece of trash who doesn’t even have a heaven spiritual body should obediently stay in blood jade Palace. Coming to ancient Moon sanctuary is only a disgrace!”</p><p>Tuoba Fei continued to sneer.</p><p>Xu Ran clenched his fists and the veins on his face twitched. He wanted to fight with his opponent to wash away his shame, but he knew very well that he was no match for his opponent.</p><p>“Where did this Mad Dog come from, barking here and there, it’s so annoying!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke calmly.</p><p>Xu Ran was slightly stunned.</p><p>Tuoba Fei’s face darkened. He squinted and looked at Lu Ming.”Brat, who are you calling a Mad Dog?”</p><p>“Who should say who!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Tuoba Fei’s eyes flashed with cold killing intent, ” kid, do you know that you have to pay a price for saying some words? some prices are not something you can bear!</p><p>“The rabid dog is going to bite!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Tuoba Fei’s gaze turned even colder. He took a step forward and his powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Great mastery of bright Saint!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Tuoba Fei had reached the upper tier of the bright Saint stage and had a heavenly spiritual body. No wonder he was so arrogant and looked down on Xu Ran.</p><p>If he was in the Azure continent, he would be able to easily crush the divine Son.</p><p>“The Jade Lake has appeared!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ripples appeared in the sky, and then, a vast Palace appeared out of thin air.</p><p>The palaces were endless, as if they were in the void. Apart from the palace in front that could be seen clearly, the palaces behind were blurry and could not be seen clearly at all. It was as if they were immortal palaces.</p><p>The Jade Lake had another name, which was the Jade Lake divine Palace!</p><p>The appearance of the Jade Lake divine Palace attracted everyone’s attention, including Tuoba Fei.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll let you off for now!”</p><p>Tuoba Fei said coldly as he looked at the Jade Lake divine Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not take it to heart.</p><p>At this moment, the gate of the Jade Lake divine Palace opened, and a woman in Palace clothes walked out.</p><p>The woman looked to be in her forties, but she still retained her charm and lithe figure. She must have been a devastatingly beautiful woman when she was young.</p><p>the Jade lake’s Saint is coming out today. Thank you for your support!</p><p>The voice of the woman in the court dress spread through the entire place.</p><p>I’m sure all of you know that the Holy Virgin of the Jade Lake is interested in choosing a guardian. We’ll support each other and walk on the great path together. Of course, it’s up to your fate whether you can become a guardian or not!</p><p>The woman continued.</p><p>The paragons did not make a sound. They just waited quietly.</p><p>He was waiting for the Jade Lake Saint to appear.</p><p>there are nine Jade Lake saintesses in this generation. I’ll ask them to come out now!</p><p>The woman in the court dress waved her hand, and another wave appeared in the sky. Then, many pavilions appeared out of thin air, floating in the air.</p><p>In each Pavilion, there was a Jade table. On the Jade table, there were dishes and wine.</p><p>And at each of the Jade tables, there was a peerless beauty.</p><p>There were nine pavilions, nine Jade tables, and nine beautiful women.</p><p>Each of them was devastatingly beautiful, like fairies descending to the mortal world. Each of them had their own charm, and their temperaments were completely different.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful!”</p><p>Not far away, Tuoba Fei’s eyes were wide open, burning with passion.</p><p>It wasn’t just him, many people were the same.</p><p>The Jade Lake saintess was indeed too beautiful. Each of them was a rare beauty in the world.</p><p>What was even rarer was that each of the Jade Lake saintesses had a rare talent in martial arts and a profound cultivation.</p><p>However, what surprised Lu Ming was not their beauty. Although they were beautiful, Xie nianqing was definitely better than them. What surprised Lu Ming was their talent.</p><p>All of them had heavenly spiritual bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Some monarch-level forces didn’t even have a heavenly spiritual body, but nine of them had come from the Jade Lake immortal Palace, and each of them was a rare beauty.</p><p>“So this is one of the powerful forces in the Gu Yue Holy Land? It’s truly shocking!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>nine pavilions, nine saintesses. Today, whoever can get on one of the pavilions will be able to drink wine and discuss martial arts with the Jade Lake saintess!</p><p>The woman’s voice rang out again, causing many people’s eyes to glow with a burning light.</p><p>There were only nine pavilions and nine beauties. However, there were so many heaven’s favorites here. To be able to enter a Pavilion was not only to be able to drink with a beauty, it was also an honor.</p><p>“Who is willing to come up and drink with this little sister?”</p><p>In the first Pavilion, a crisp voice rang out. The woman by the Jade table stood up and waved her hand. A Jade ladder extended down from the pavilion and landed on the lake.</p><p>“Haha, then let me go first!”</p><p>hahaha! a loud laugh rang out as Wan Tianlong, the pride of the WAN family, stepped out and landed on the Jade stairs. Then, he walked up the Jade stairs.</p><p>Many people’s eyes fell on Wan Tianlong, including the two crown princes of the Golden Crow race, the prodigies of the Thunder God sect, the great barren sword sect, and other powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>However, these heaven’s favorites didn’t move.</p><p>There were nine pavilions, so they were not in a hurry.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ve also taken a fancy to this Pavilion. Please leave!”</p><p>A deep voice rang out. Near Lu Ming and the others, a young man with fiery red hair took a step forward and landed on the Jade steps as well. His body was covered in terrifying flames.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Wan Tianlong’s eyes gleamed coldly. A light spot appeared in his palm, and a great saint weapon appeared. He swung it at the red-haired youth.</p><p>“Heaven burning flames!”</p><p>The red-haired young man let out a loud roar as he unleashed all of his cultivation. He struck out with his palms continuously, and terrifying flames formed into a pillar of fire that shot towards Wan Tianlong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
