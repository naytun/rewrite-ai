Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and cast the divine sword technique. Two sword lights pierced mo Kong’s glabella, penetrating his soul in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>...</p><p>However, mo Kong’s body only trembled for a moment before he recovered.</p><p>“This old man’s soul is really strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He used the thundering wind steps and rushed towards mo kong, striking out with his palm.</p><p>Mo kong roared and formed a spear of God’s punishment in his hand. He thrust it at Lu Ming, but the spear exploded when it collided with Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm did not stop. Mo Kong’s expression changed drastically. Laws gathered on his palm and he used it to block.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mo Kong’s body was sent flying. One of his palms exploded, and he spat out blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air and charged at mo kong, his eyes as cold as a knife.</p><p>Since he was an enemy, he would not show mercy just because the other party was old.</p><p>divine power, holy light cutting!</p><p>Mo kong used his divine power again. The Holy Light ribbon swept out, but it was once again shattered by Lu Ming’s palm and continued to attack his opponent.</p><p>Mo kong retreated frantically, not daring to confront Lu Ming head-on.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually defeat a perfected bright Saint who had mastered a sacred art and chased after him to the point where he did not dare to meet him. His combat power had already exceeded everyone’s imagination.</p><p>The Azure continent’s bright Saint was invincible!</p><p>With such combat power, who else in the Cang state could fight against the bright Saint?</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice was heard. The sect master of the heavenly God sect waved his hand with a cold face. A stream of Saint power swept mokong back to the heavenly God sect’s camp.</p><p>Lu Ming also stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“He’s been defeated. Who else from your three sects will come out to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The experts of the three sects were silent.</p><p>Even mo kong had been defeated, who else could fight?</p><p>The other sects might also have old monsters who had lived for a long time, but their combat strength was at most on par with mo kong. Even if they were to fight, they would not be Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>For a moment, no one from the three sects came out to fight.</p><p>The scene was deathly silent.</p><p>“It seems that you have admitted defeat. Since no one is going to fight, according to the agreement, you all have to retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he stared at the three sect leaders.</p><p>“What a joke. Why should we retreat?”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect sneered, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>you guys agreed to it just now, and there were countless witnesses. Are you guys going back on your word? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Of course we won’t go back on our word. But what we agreed to bet with you just now was Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. If we win, you hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. If you win, we will back out. But it’s only a bet on Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures.”</p><p>now, we suspect that you have other inheritances and treasures on you. Hand them over!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect sneered.</p><p>“You’re despicable and shameless, you’re quibbling!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master roared.</p><p>haha, so this is how shameless you are. As the head of a sect, you’re really shameless to the extreme!</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud. He really did not expect the other party to be so shameless.</p><p>“Nonsense, since you’ve come out, don’t go back!”</p><p>die! the sect master of the sky demon sect shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, a huge demonic claw swiped at Lu Ming. A terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming like Mount Tai.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and burst out with all his might. He threw a punch at the void behind him. The void seemed to be broken by Lu Ming’s power as he retreated rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light shot into the sky.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master made his move and slashed open the demonic claw with his sword.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and take down Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shouted.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>At the same time, the sect Masters of the deity sect and the desire poison sect attacked together and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as the master of Ice Dragon Valley stepped forward and punched out. A huge Ice Dragon condensed and blocked the attacks of the two sect Masters of the deity sect and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a beam of holy light rushed out from the crowd of the tianshen sect. It was incomparably dazzling and rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Absolute Saint!</p><p>Another absolute Saint. Another absolute Saint had secretly come to the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master roared. His voice was like thunder as he slashed out with his sword. The terrifying sword light seemed to break through the void and cut at the absolute Saints who were charging out.</p><p>The absolute saint’s body was surrounded by holy light. He extended a finger, and the terrifying holy light was like a ribbon that swept toward the cloud Dragon Valley master’s sword light.</p><p>It was the sacred art, the sacred light severing!</p><p>However, this absolute saint’s technique was dozens of times stronger than mo Kong’s. There was no comparison at all.</p><p>The sacred light slash continued to cut at the cloud Dragon Valley master’s sword-light.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>retreat! the valley master of Cloud Dragon shouted. He moved and appeared beside Lu Ming. He wrapped Lu Ming with his Saint power and retreated to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master followed closely behind.</p><p>With their combat strength, if they wanted to retreat, the other party would not be able to stop them.</p><p>The two of them retreated back into the dragon God Valley’s sect-protecting array.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sect Masters of the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the other Supreme Saints appeared outside the protective array of the Dragon God Valley. Their momentum was like a rainbow, forming a terrible wind that constantly hit the protective array of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“It seems that the Dragon God Valley is going to protect Lu Ming to the end!”</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect said coldly. When he opened his eyes, a dazzling holy light burst forth, which was extremely shocking.</p><p>what cover up? Lu Ming is a disciple of the Dragon God Valley, and it’s our duty to protect him. It’s you major sects who go back on your words and refuse to admit that you lost the bet. What a joke!</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>alright, in that case, we’ll destroy Dragon God Valley. From now on, there will be no dragon God Valley in the Azure region!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect spoke. Although she was a woman, she was extremely domineering.</p><p>all members of the Tian Yu demon sect, listen up! Form a formation and attack Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect was the first to give the order.</p><p>all members of the Yu Du sect, listen up! Form a large formation and attack Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Following that, the sect master of the desire poison sect also issued an order.</p><p>The eyes of the tianshen sect’s sect master flickered. He didn’t expect the sky demon sect and the Yu Du sect to be so decisive and directly give the order to attack. In the end, he also gave the order to attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>…..</p><p>Tens of thousands of experts from the three sects stepped out, their killing intent surging like a tide. Terrifying energy erupted, forming a terrifying formation.</p><p>In the Tianyu demonic sect, many experts gathered to form a three-headed and six-armed demonic god. Each arm was holding a weapon. It was a hundred thousand feet tall, larger than a mountain, and it attacked Dragon God Valley.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The demonic God’s aura was too terrifying. The attack landed on the sect-protecting Grand array of Dragon God Valley, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>On the other side, the Yu Du sect’s formation gathered and formed a huge toad. Although it was not a million feet tall, it was still tens of thousands of feet tall. With a loud cry, it spewed out a terrible poisonous gas, completely submerging the entire Dragon God Valley’s entrance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
