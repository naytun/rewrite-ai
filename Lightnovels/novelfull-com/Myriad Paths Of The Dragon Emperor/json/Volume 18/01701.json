Lu Ming cooperated with bubbles and fought a bloody battle.</p><p>...</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, no one could kill him unless they were in the great circle of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>“All of you, attack and end the battle quickly!”</p><p>Elder mo hun ordered the four middle-aged men behind him.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The four middle-aged men nodded, their expressions dull. Then, they stepped forward, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>This was the aura of a Supreme Saint.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>The other side had four Supreme Saints, which was enough to overturn the battle.</p><p>One of them stepped forward and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Yang tianzong, Longyuan mountain and the rest’s expressions changed.</p><p>Lu Ming would not stand a chance against a great saint.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The burly man with a wooden expression struck out with his palm, and a terrifying palm print blasted towards Lu Ming. The terrifying pressure made Lu Ming’s expression turn extremely grave.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated rapidly, but the palm print followed him like a shadow.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>With a wave of her claws, the space around them fluctuated as spacetime laws circulated. A powerful force was exerted on the wooden middle-aged man.</p><p>However, the other party’s cultivation was too strong. He was a Supreme Saint, and his every move could destroy mountains and rivers.</p><p>Saint energy surged from the other party’s body and broke through the space-time law, continuing to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure shattered like a mirror. He reappeared a few hundred meters away with a grave look in his eyes.</p><p>The Supreme Saint was too powerful. He couldn’t resist at all.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The wooden-looking middle-aged man continued to step forward, seemingly staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>His speed was shockingly fast as he neared Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as a true purple dragon pounced towards the middle-aged man. The middle-aged man struck out with his palm and collided with the purple vacuum. His body was forced back by the impact.</p><p>With a flash of purple light, the purple dragon Valley master appeared next to Lu Ming. At this time, the purple dragon Valley master’s body was covered with purple dragon scales, which were crystal and resplendent, as if they were made of purple jade. Two dragon horns appeared on his forehead, which was the performance of the purple dragon combat body at its peak.</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master came to Lu Ming’s side, and his opponent also rushed toward him.</p><p>“Let’s gather together and charge out together!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master roared and blocked the opponent’s attack with a claw. Then, he rolled up his vital essence and continued to flash with Lu Ming, regrouping with yang tianzong, Longyuan mountain, and the others.</p><p>“Right, let’s gather!”</p><p>A Supreme Saint of the life-and-death Sword sect shouted.</p><p>“Gather!”</p><p>The Supreme Saints of the other sects all shouted.</p><p>The Saints and ordinary disciples of all the sects started to gather. The people of Dragon God Valley and the life-and-death Sword sect were the first to gather.</p><p>After gathering together, they formed a circle and entered a defensive state, defending with all their strength.</p><p>Following that, the other sects also slowly gathered together after paying a price.</p><p>In the beginning, it was one or two, then two or three sects. Slowly, all the sects started to move closer to each other.</p><p>In the end, even the people of the heavenly God sect, after paying a great price, also rushed over and joined the crowd.</p><p>Lu Ming glanced around and realized that at least half of the people from the heavenly God sect had been killed.</p><p>Originally, there were several thousand people, but now there were less than two thousand. The losses were extremely heavy.</p><p>However, Xie nianjun was clearly under heavy protection and was fine.</p><p>The 13 sects gathered together and formed a circle.</p><p>Evil Spirit’s people surrounded the group and kept attacking.</p><p>&Nbsp; but with the 13 top sects working together, they were able to block the attack.</p><p>there are too many people below the Saint realm. It’s hard to break out!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>those below the Saint realm, enter my mountain and river diagram!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, and the mountain and river diagram floated out.</p><p>it’s an estate-world treasure! Right, hurry up and get an estate-world treasure!</p><p>“Don’t resist!”</p><p>The great saint experts shouted.</p><p>If everyone below the Saint realm entered the mountain and river diagram, it would be much easier for them to break out of the siege.</p><p>In the sky, elder mo Hun’s face was gloomy as he shouted, ” “Do it!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as elder mo Hun’s voice fell, a terrifying Saber Light burst out.</p><p>These saber gleams were not attacking Lu Ming and the rest from the outside. Instead, they exploded from the inside.</p><p>The people of the intentionless saber sect made their move at this moment. They attacked the other sects.</p><p>“Intentionless saber sect, you guys … Traitor!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the heavenly God sect let out a crazy roar because a Supreme Saint of the intentionless saber sect had pierced his dantian with a knife and shattered his Saint heart.</p><p>When a saint’s Saint heart was broken, his cultivation would be crippled.</p><p>Never in his dreams would he have thought that the people of the intentionless saber sect would suddenly turn against him.</p><p>“Ah, ah, damn it!”</p><p>The others were also furious.</p><p>The ones closest to the intentionless saber sect were the heaven God sect and the evil moon sect. These two sects had been attacked by the intentionless saber sect and had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that there was more than one Supreme Saint in the intentionless saber sect. There were actually quite a few of them who had suddenly risen in revolt. The thirteen sects were instantly in chaos.</p><p>It was obvious that this had been planned.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The surrounding evil spirit cultivators took this opportunity to charge over.</p><p>With the cooperation from both the inside and outside, the defense of the Azure continent’s major sects collapsed in an instant.</p><p>The most miserable ones were the heavenly God sect and the evil moon sect. The Supreme Saints leading the two sects were killed in a surprise attack.</p><p>“Defend!”</p><p>The purple dragon Valley master shouted. The Dragon God Valley and the life-and-death Sword sect stood side by side and defended with all their might.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming cooperated with bubbles and killed two sages in a row. His entire body was bathed in sacred blood.</p><p>intentionless saber sect, you’ve actually joined evil spirit. Aren’t you afraid of the revenge of all the sects in the Azure continent? ”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>haha, as long as I kill all of you today, who would know that the intentionless saber sect is related to evil spirit? ”</p><p>One of the great saints from the intentionless saber sect sneered.</p><p>Everyone’s heart turned cold.</p><p>That’s right. If they all died today, who would know that the intentionless saber sect had already joined evil spirit?</p><p>The intentionless saber sect could continue to mingle with the various sects of the Azure continent. At the critical moment, they could deal a fatal blow to the various sects of the Azure continent.</p><p>“You won’t succeed!”</p><p>Someone roared.</p><p>hahaha, my evil spirit will rise again. It’s unstoppable!</p><p>In the sky, elder mo hun sneered.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shaking roar was heard. It sounded like the roar of an ancient beast. Then, a huge Golden Claw, covered in golden hair, reached out from the distant sky and grabbed at elder mo hun.</p><p>Elder mo Hun’s expression changed and he shouted, ” “Absolute Saint!”</p><p>“Lord, it’s the Lord!”</p><p>The experts of the demon Castle roared in excitement.</p><p>The others were also very excited. They had never expected that the Lord of Demon Castle would actually come here at this time.</p><p>But at this moment, a terrifying sword light slashed down from the sky, slashing toward the Golden Claw.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the Golden Claw retracted, and the sword light collapsed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
