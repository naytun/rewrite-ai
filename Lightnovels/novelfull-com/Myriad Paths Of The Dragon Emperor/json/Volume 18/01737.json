The cloud Dragon Valley master had pushed Yin Zheng back in anger.</p><p>Later on, he had used the power of the third bloodline to transform into a killing puppet. It was the cloud Dragon Valley master who had arrived in time and saved him. He had frozen him for half a year to erase his endless killing intent.</p><p>And many, many more …</p><p>It could be said that without the cloud Dragon Valley master, Lu Ming would not be where he was today.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had to make such a choice. Lu Ming found it difficult to do it.</p><p>Ming ‘er, don’t be silly. Your senior brothers and the rest of Dragon God Valley depend on you to save them. You don’t have to worry about me. If I can’t win, I’ll just surrender and wait for you to come back and save me. The evil spirit cult needs strength to rise again. They won’t kill me.</p><p>&Nbsp; Cloud Dragon Valley master continued, ” also, escape and go to ancient Moon Holy Land. Ask for help from them. Only a powerful faction from ancient Moon Holy Land can deal with evil spirit sect!</p><p>if we’re all captured, we’ll have no hope. Let’s go!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master shouted.</p><p>“Master, take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and used the divine Wind steps to fly forward at top speed.</p><p>Lu Ming was also a decisive person. He struggled in his heart for a while and made a decision very quickly.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master stopped and held his sword in one hand. His white clothes were like snow and his white hair danced in the wind. His eyes were like lightning as he looked at the DI family’s experts rushing over.</p><p>Roar! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded as sword Qi shot up into the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw two shocking sword gleams meeting in the air and colliding fiercely.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and he clenched his fists tightly. As he used too much force, his nails dug into his palms and blood flowed.</p><p>His eyes were bloodshot, and he was roaring in his heart, ” master, you must be fine! I will come back to save you in the future! Evil spirit cult, di family, I will destroy them with my own hands!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the distance, sword Qi shot up into the sky, constantly clashing with each other. It was extremely intense.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and pushed his speed to the limit. He dashed into the distance like a stream of light and finally rushed into the vast mountains.</p><p>After rushing into the mountain, Lu Ming transformed the chaos rule into the law of the earth and then rushed into the ground. Lu Ming’s entire body sank into the ground and he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming travelled underground, surrounded by laws. His speed was still extremely shocking.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had cast the illusionary breath technique to conceal his aura to the extreme. Not a single trace of his aura was leaked out.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming had been traveling underground for two days and two nights. He had no idea how far he had run.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally stopped. With a single thought, he entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was left deep underground.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a pile of raw gemstones and devoured and refined them. Not long after, Lu Ming’s holy power was fully recovered.</p><p>“I wonder what happened to master? I hope that shizun can’t win and directly surrender!”</p><p>and nianqing. Did he and the Ice Dragon patriarch escape? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were full of worry.</p><p>Strength. At this moment, he was extremely eager for strength.</p><p>His cultivation speed was already very fast.</p><p>It had been more than five years since he came to the yuan continent.</p><p>When he had just arrived in the yuan continent, he was only at the Supreme level and had not yet become an Emperor. But now, he was already a Saint.</p><p>It was shocking that he had crossed such a huge distance in just a little more than five years.</p><p>One should know that after reaching the rank of a Martial Emperor, the concept of time became more and more unclear. Many people would go into closed-door cultivation for ten years, decades, or even hundreds of years.</p><p>In five to six years, many people might not even be able to cross one level of cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was already very fast. It was not inferior to some of the peerless geniuses.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was even more shocking. With his cultivation of initial bright Saint, he could even kill an ordinary initial Supreme Saint if he used all his means. There had never been one in the Azure continent since ancient times.</p><p>However, such a battle prowess was naturally high up in the Azure continent’s younger generation. It was impossible to surpass him, but in the face of an Emperor-ranked power, he was still so powerless.</p><p>In Emperor-ranked forces, let alone Martial Emperor powerhouses.</p><p>He wasn’t a match for any of the emperors-to-be or absolute Saints.</p><p>He had to keep improving.</p><p>If he had the cultivation base of a martial Supreme, he could directly trample on the DI family and annihilate the DI family and evil spirit cult.</p><p>master, just you wait, I will definitely go to ancient Moon Holy Land and get reinforcements. Even if there are no reinforcements, I will definitely save you all!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were determined. He moved and appeared in a Valley.</p><p>In the valley, there was a milky-white light cocoon, and within the light cocoon was bubble.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and left the place. He sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>“I can’t go out now. I guess evil spirit and di family are looking for me all over the world. I’ll go out after a while!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming then closed his eyes and began to study the finger of tribulation of chaos.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>In the distance, a beam of light shot into the sky and interrupted Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He took a step forward and appeared in the valley.</p><p>At that moment, the light cocoon that was formed by bubbles was extremely dazzling. After a while, the light receded and Lu Ming saw a figure in the light.</p><p>Yes, it was a figure, an adult.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that bubbles has transformed?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>When the light completely disappeared, a little girl appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a little girl who looked to be only two or three years old. Her hair was loose and she was naked, revealing her skin that was even fairer and smoother than white jade. She looked chubby and extremely cute.</p><p>“This is bubble? It really is a woman!”</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied.</p><p>“Lu … Brother Lu Ming, chirp, chirp …”</p><p>The cute little girl blinked her big eyes. When she saw Lu Ming, she called out in a childish voice and pounced toward Lu Ming. She threw herself into Lu Ming’s arms, her chubby body rolling in his arms.</p><p>“Bubble, you’ve transformed?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The spirit sea was already capable of transforming ordinary demonic beasts.</p><p>However, divine beasts could only transform after they reached the Emperor realm.</p><p>The higher the level, the harder it was to transform.</p><p>Bubbles was one of the top ten war beasts, but it could only transform after reaching the Saint realm.</p><p>“It’s … That’s right, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles opened her mouth and spoke in a childish voice. Her speech was not smooth and she even had a ‘chirpy’ tone at the end. She was really as cute as she could be.</p><p>haha, bubble, put on your clothes!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and his mood finally improved.</p><p>“Yes, brother Lu Ming, chirp chirp!”</p><p>She was sparkling, and there was light flowing on her body. She weaved a little dress with Saint power, which made her look even cuter.</p><p>“Bubble, let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He then let bubbles sit on his shoulder. Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram, concealed his aura, and headed to the ground.</p><p>More than half a month had passed, so the other party must have left this area!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
