He circulated the divine breath technique with all his might, but not a single bit of his original aura seeped out.</p><p>In the next moment, he felt a terrifying spiritual sense sweep past him. However, it did not stop and in the next moment, it swept to other places.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that the Emperor-level powerhouse did not recognize him.</p><p>There were so many people in the myriad spirit exchange, but the Emperor-ranked expert only needed to sweep his gaze across them to see through his divine breath technique.</p><p>In the sky, a figure stood quietly. In the thousand spirit exchange, countless people looked up, but they could not see the man’s face clearly. It was as if there was a world around him that blocked their vision.</p><p>…..</p><p>At this moment, the person frowned and retracted his spiritual sense. He muttered, ’’ “It seems like it’s not here!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the figure disappeared. The terrifying pressure also disappeared.</p><p>Everyone in the thousand spirit exchange felt their hearts relax.</p><p>A Martial Emperor was too powerful.</p><p>Even the lowest minor Emperor position was extremely terrifying and had an endless lifespan. It had the power to destroy the world and could kill millions of people with a thought.</p><p>as expected, even the Emperor-level powerhouses have been mobilized. Lu Ming can’t escape even if he has wings!</p><p>“Do you think Lu Ming is hiding in the Phoenix Palace or the divine elephant sect?”</p><p>it’s useless even if he’s hiding in Phoenix Palace or divine elephant sect. These two sects can’t protect him!</p><p>As soon as the Emperor-level powerhouse left, the surroundings were filled with discussions again. However, Lu Ming only ate and drank quietly. Not long after, he returned to his room.</p><p>At this time, outside the Phoenix Palace, a few terrifying figures descended. Each figure exuded a terrifying aura. It was all Emperor’s might. Several Emperor-level experts descended on the Phoenix Palace at the same time.</p><p>“Emperor level expert!”</p><p>Almost everyone in the Phoenix Palace was alarmed. One figure after another flew out and looked at the Emperor-level experts in the sky with grave expressions.</p><p>“May I know why all of you have come to my Phoenix Palace at the same time?”</p><p>A voice was heard. Then, a woman in Palace clothes stepped out and appeared in the sky above the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>This person was the palace Master of Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Phoenix Palace Master, we’re here to take someone back. Please hand over Lu Ming!</p><p>One of them said from the sky. His aura was extremely sharp. The Qi of a combat weapon swept across the sky, turning into countless illusionary weapons.</p><p>“Lu Ming isn’t in the Phoenix Palace!”</p><p>The palace Master said.</p><p>“Not here? Master of the Phoenix Palace, don’t shield Lu Ming. Even if you do, you can’t!”</p><p>Another figure spoke. At this time, his aura was violent and ferocious, like a peerless fierce beast. This person was an Emperor-tier expert of the Skywolf tower.</p><p>I’ve said that Lu Ming is not in Phoenix Palace. I can use the name of Phoenix Palace’s master as a guarantee!</p><p>The palace Master said.</p><p>In the sky, a few powerful beings frowned.</p><p>Since the master of the Phoenix Palace had said so, Lu Ming was most likely not around.</p><p>Phoenix Palace’s disciple, Huang Ling, helped Lu Ming to kill the paragons of the four major forces. Her crime is unforgivable. Phoenix Palace Master, hand over Huang Ling!</p><p>The WAN family’s martial sovereign said coldly.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace Lord’s voice turned cold as she said,” Feng Ling didn’t kill anyone from your four forces. What does it have to do with her?”</p><p>“Of course he did. He helped Lu Ming kill the paragons of the four major forces. Otherwise, how could Lu Ming have done it alone? She must pay the price and be buried with the geniuses of the four forces!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign’s voice was heard again, and it was filled with killing intent.</p><p>what a joke. I’ve already investigated the matter. The reason why Huang Ling attacked was because the elders of the four major forces attacked them. Countless people in the ten thousand spirit exchange saw this. Under such circumstances, if she didn’t attack, would she have allowed them to kill her?”</p><p>Said the palace Master.</p><p>“Phoenix Palace Master, you’re not handing her over?”</p><p>The WAN clan Martial Emperor’s voice turned even colder.</p><p>No. If you want to start a war with Phoenix Palace because of this, I’ll keep you company!</p><p>The palace Master was very domineering.</p><p>In the sky, a few Emperor-level powerhouses frowned.</p><p>At that time, it was true that the older generation had attacked first and Huang Ling and the others had fought back. However, at that time, Huang Ling had tried to stop the older generation, but the Phoenix Palace Master had said that it was to protect herself.</p><p>Most importantly, Huang Ling did not kill anyone from the four forces. If they started a war with Phoenix Palace because of this, other forces would probably interfere.</p><p>This was because the Phoenix Palace also had friendly forces.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming was here and Phoenix Palace was still protecting him, they would have a reason to take action and the other forces would not be able to interfere.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had already seen through this. That was why he did not come to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Where’s Huang Ling? get her out. I want to ask her about Lu Ming!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s Martial Emperor said coldly.</p><p>“I’m here!”</p><p>Huang Ling stepped out and stood in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN clan and the demon sovereigns of the Skywolf tower looked at Huang Ling. A terrifying pressure pressed down on her, causing her expression to change. She retreated and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>With a wave of her hand, the palace Master cast a beam of energy onto Feng Ling, isolating her from the pressure.</p><p>“Speak. Where is Lu Ming?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s martial sovereign’s voice was heard.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Huang Ling shook her head.</p><p>“I don’t know. You dare to lie?”</p><p>let’s go! the martial sovereign of the WAN clan shouted deafeningly, and the world was rumbling.</p><p>Huang Ling’s face turned pale, but she still raised her head stubbornly and said,” if you don’t know, then you don’t know. Lu Ming and 1 split up after we left the thousand spirit exchange. With Lu Ming’s intelligence, he naturally knew that it was useless to come to the Phoenix Palace, so he left alone!</p><p>“I don’t believe you. I’m going to search your soul to confirm it!”</p><p>The WAN family Martial Emperor’s cold voice was heard. Then, he raised his hand and a huge hand grabbed at Huang Ling.</p><p>This claw was like a world of its own, and it was impossible to avoid.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>With a wave of her hand, a Phoenix flew out and destroyed the huge hand.</p><p>an Emperor attacking a junior disciple is really shameful. If you want to fight, I will fight with you!</p><p>The palace Master said.</p><p>At the same time, a few more terrifying auras rushed out of the Phoenix Palace, and the emperor’s might was vast.</p><p>The martial sovereigns of the WAN family, the heavenly Wolf tower, and the heavenly Bird Palace frowned and looked at each other.</p><p>1 hope you’re telling the truth. Otherwise, we’ll fight the Phoenix Palace!</p><p>The WAN clan’s Martial Emperor said. After he finished speaking, he turned around and took a step forward, disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Following that, the other martial sovereigns also disappeared.</p><p>“Return to the mountain!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace master’s face was grave as he returned to the Phoenix Palace with Feng Ling.</p><p>The same scene was also playing out in the divine elephant sect.</p><p>…..</p><p>However, the divine elephant sect was even more overbearing. Long Chen’s master was a terrifying existence. He had sent a Martial Emperor flying with a single blow. The experts of the four forces could only retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming was not in the divine elephant sect, so it was not appropriate for them to take action.</p><p>However, after that, the four major forces sent out even more powerful cultivators to search for Lu Ming in the entire ancient Moon sanctuary, but to no avail..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
