It seemed that it was better to rely on oneself than on others.</p><p>As long as he was strong, there was no need to ask for help from others.</p><p>...</p><p>master, please be patient for a while. When I’m strong enough, I’ll definitely come back to save you!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>little guy, change your condition. I’ll try my best to satisfy what I can!</p><p>The palace Master of Phoenix Palace seemed to feel a little apologetic and continued.</p><p>Lu Ming composed himself and had an idea. He said,”Palace Master, I’ve killed a few assassins from the thousand kills mansion, and I have the killer’s Mark on my body. Can senior help me remove it?”</p><p>With the mark of the thousand-kill mansion on his body, he would be sensed by the other party within a certain range. If he met someone from the thousand-kill mansion again, he would definitely be annoyed and have to be on guard against being assassinated every day.</p><p>“This is easy!”</p><p>The palace Master waved his hand and a ray of light enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a warm sensation all over his body. Then, he saw a wisp of gray airflow emerging from Lu Ming’s body. It was constantly twisting and it was very strange.</p><p>This was the slaughter mark.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Master squeezed it gently, and the slaughter mark turned into ashes.</p><p>alright, the mark of slaughter has been removed. Also, you’ve helped Feng Ling a lot this time by helping her obtain the heart of the parasol tree. You’re now a friend of the Phoenix Palace, so you can stay here for a while. You’re free to enter some of the cultivation sanctuaries in the Phoenix Palace!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord smiled.</p><p>“Many thanks, Palace Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>Although the other party did not agree to send experts to annihilate evil Spirit’s remnants, the other party was an Overlord and an Emperor-level expert. Lu Ming could not continue to ask.</p><p>mm, you can leave now. Let Huang Ling take you around!</p><p>The palace Master said.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bade farewell to Huang Ling and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry!”</p><p>On the way back, Huang Ling said in embarrassment.</p><p>“Nothing much? I can understand that you need to consider the Phoenix Palace as well!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile. He knew that Huang Ling was referring to the fact that the Phoenix Palace Master had not sent any experts to help.</p><p>Lu Ming, there are some good cultivation sanctuaries in the Phoenix Palace. I’ll show you around in a few days. You can stay in the Phoenix Palace for a while!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while before they went their separate ways. Lu Ming returned to his residence.</p><p>After returning to the courtyard, Lu Ming released bubbles and let her play nearby while he went into seclusion to cultivate.</p><p>A few days passed by in a flash.</p><p>On this day, two forces arrived at the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>These two forces were the Golden Crow Tribe and the WAN family.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be from Phoenix Palace welcomed him.</p><p>“I wonder why the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan have come to the Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Phoenix Palace asked.</p><p>it’s simple. The WAN family is here to ask for a person from Phoenix Palace!</p><p>Said an elder from the WAN family. Behind him stood a few burly middle-aged men and a few young men. One of them was Wan Tianlong.</p><p>the Golden Crow Tribe also wants a person from the Phoenix Palace!</p><p>The one who spoke was a middle-aged man in a golden robe. His eyes were cold and his aura was overbearing.</p><p>Behind this middle-aged man were a few other people. Among them were a few young men, the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>Phoenix Palace’s Emperor-to-be’s face darkened and said, ” what a joke. You two came to my Phoenix Palace to ask for her!</p><p>don’t be angry, brother Huang. The person that the WAN family wants is not a disciple of the Phoenix Palace, but a young man named Lu Ming. He is currently living in the Phoenix Palace!</p><p>The old man from the WAN family said.</p><p>“Lu Ming?”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Phoenix Palace frowned. He knew that there was a young man named Lu Ming who lived in the Phoenix Palace. However, this was an order from the master of the Phoenix Palace and he was a guest of the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“The person that the Golden Crow clan wants is also this person, Lu Ming!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Golden Crow race said coldly.</p><p>everyone, I’m afraid we can’t do that. Lu Ming is a guest of the Phoenix Palace. Since he’s here, we must ensure his safety!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of Phoenix Palace said.</p><p>brother Huang, you’d better consider this carefully. The WAN family is determined to get Lu Ming. This person has cultivated the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art. The WAN family will not allow this to happen!</p><p>The old man of the WAN family said coldly.</p><p>“There’s no room for discussion on this matter. I’ve already said that since Lu Ming is a guest at the Phoenix Palace, he’s a guest of the Phoenix Palace. If the Phoenix Palace hands Lu Ming over to you, what will others think of us? Everyone, please return!”</p><p>Phoenix Palace’s Emperor-to-be said with a tough attitude.</p><p>The WAN family and the Golden Crow clan’s faces turned cold. They did not expect that the Phoenix Palace would protect Lu Ming and refuse to hand him over.</p><p>However, the WAN family master had instructed that Lu Ming could not be allowed to live.</p><p>The ten thousand soldiers art must not be cultivated by outsiders.</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out here!”</p><p>At this moment, the WAN family’s elder suddenly roared. His voice rumbled and spread throughout the entire Phoenix Palace.</p><p>“Impudent! What are you doing?”</p><p>Phoenix Palace’s Emperor-to-be’s expression changed and he shouted.</p><p>The other party was too presumptuous. He was actually shouting in Phoenix Palace.</p><p>At that moment, most of the people in Phoenix Palace were alarmed.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating when he was awakened by the loud roar.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darkened as he looked in the direction of the sound. He then rose into the air and flew in that direction at top speed.</p><p>Not long after, a large hall appeared in front of them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, many figures were flying over.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>A delicate voice rang out. It was Huang Ling. She had also appeared here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan are here. They want the Phoenix Palace to hand you over!”</p><p>Huang Ling hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“The WAN family and the Golden Crow clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he strode toward the main hall. As he neared the main hall, he saw two groups of people standing in the air outside the main hall.</p><p>They were the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan.</p><p>“He is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wan Tianlong pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The people from the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan looked at Lu Ming in unison.</p><p>“Boy, you’re Lu Ming. Now, follow me back to the WAN family. The WAN family has something to tell you!”</p><p>The old man of the WAN family said coldly, in a commanding tone.</p><p>It was as if Lu Ming had to do as he was told.</p><p>I have nothing to explain to the WAN family. Besides, I’m living very well in the Phoenix Palace. I’m not interested in going to the WAN family with you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The old man from the WAN family’s face darkened, and a sharp glint flashed across his eyes. kid, don’t play dumb here. You’ve cultivated the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art. You must give us an explanation for this. Outsiders are not allowed to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers art. If you destroy your cultivation now, the WAN family will not pursue this matter!</p><p>hehe, so it’s because of this. Then, why has your golden Crow clan come to find me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the Golden Crow Tribe.</p><p>you must be punished for insulting the Golden Crow race!</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Golden Crow clan replied simply.</p><p>hahaha, this is ridiculous! This is the biggest joke in the world!</p><p>Lu Ming could not stop laughing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
