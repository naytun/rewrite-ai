It was said that when one reached a certain realm, even if one’s body was destroyed, one’s soul would still exist in this world. One could even use the heaven and earth energy to form a new body at any time.</p><p>At this point, he had truly reached the realm of immortality.</p><p>...</p><p>As long as the soul was not destroyed, one would not die!</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had a long way to go before he could reach this realm.</p><p>Because he had just broken through to the sage realm, his soul had just taken shape. It couldn’t even leave his body, as it would be torn apart by the energy of heaven and earth.</p><p>The soul and the spirit God were completely different.</p><p>The spirit God was actually condensed from essential core but the soul was not. It was nurtured by Lu Ming’s spiritual will. It was extremely mysterious and related to the secret of immortality.</p><p>Slowly, the soul left the spiritual God and turned into a ray of light, rushing into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. He sat cross-legged in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>After the soul was separated from the spirit God, the spirit God began to transform into a Saint heart under the effect of the law of chaos.</p><p>The Saint heart used the laws as the core and the Saint power as the foundation. In the future, as the laws grew stronger, the Saint heart could evolve into a small world.</p><p>Time passed by slowly. In the blink of an eye, another half a month had passed. Two Saint hearts appeared in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>One of them was filled with chaotic Qi, as if it was nurturing a universe.</p><p>As for the other one, it was covered with strange runes, causing one to feel as if they were about to sink into it, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>“I actually have two Saint hearts!”</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also dumbfounded.</p><p>As far as he knew, other people only had one Saint heart, no matter if they cultivated the inscription Dao or martial arts.</p><p>This was because one person could only comprehend one law at the half-Saint stage.</p><p>In fact, at the martial Saint stage, one person could only comprehend one law at most. One could only comprehend many laws when they reached the martial Supreme realm.</p><p>As for the Saint heart, it was condensed on the basis of laws.</p><p>As Lu Ming had cultivated the Twin forbidden spell, his main body and secondary body had each comprehended a law. Therefore, after the fusion, he had cultivated two Sacred Hearts.</p><p>The two Saint hearts were like twins, spinning around each other.</p><p>“Then in the future, won’t I be able to cultivate two small worlds?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a strong wind blowing around him. Endless smoke suddenly appeared in the surroundings, shrouding Lu Ming. At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if he had entered a strange land. The environment between heaven and earth had changed.</p><p>“This is the Saint realm inner demon tribulation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Of course, there was a great trial to break through to the Saint realm. However, the Saint realm great trial was different from the past. It was not a lightning trial, but an inner demon trial.</p><p>The Demonheart tribulation was even more terrifying than the lightning tribulation.</p><p>Everyone had their own inner demons. If they couldn’t overcome their inner demon tribulation, then they would disappear under it.</p><p>Since ancient times, countless geniuses had failed at the last step and died under the inner demon tribulation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had experienced nine lives in the tomb of the reincarnation Emperor in the hundred clan battlefield. His mind was so firm and condensed that the inner demon tribulation could not touch him at all.</p><p>In just half a day, Lu Ming had successfully transcended his inner demon tribulation.</p><p>When Lu Ming overcame the inner demon tribulation, a strange force between heaven and earth surged into Lu Ming’s body. One had to know that this was the mountain and river diagram, but this force directly passed through it.</p><p>At that moment, the mental energy and essential core in Lu Ming’s body began to undergo a qualitative change and began to transform into Saint energy.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Then, the endless origin Qi in the mountain and river diagram gathered towards Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>raw gemstones! I need a large number of raw gemstones!</p><p>With a single thought from Lu Ming, large piles of raw gemstones appeared and exploded one after another, turning into extremely dense original Qi that surged into Lu Ming’s body, constantly refining into wisps of Saint power.</p><p>There was more and more Saint energy in Lu Ming’s body. Not long after, the original mental energy and essential core had been completely transformed into Saint energy. However, the absorption of the original Qi did not stop. There was still more original Qi being absorbed and transformed into Saint energy.</p><p>Lu Ming had two Saint hearts. The Saint power produced by two Saint hearts was too powerful. At the same time, it required more raw gemstones.</p><p>Lu Ming had already devoured countless raw gemstones. There were at least several billion pieces of medium-grade raw gemstones.</p><p>At this moment, the Saint energy in Lu Ming’s body had finally reached its saturation point.</p><p>The sage state. Lu Ming had finally entered the sage state and became a Sage.</p><p>Although he was only at the initial stages of the sage enlightenment realm, he was on a completely different level from before.</p><p>is this the Saint energy? it’s so powerful!</p><p>Lu Ming carefully sensed the Holy power that was jumping around in his body. He felt that it was filled with endless power and was many times stronger than before.</p><p>Saint energy was much stronger than Zhen Yuan. For the same amount of energy, Saint energy was at least ten times stronger than Zhen Yuan.</p><p>This was a qualitative change.</p><p>No wonder the Saint realm was so powerful. It was almost impossible to cross realms and kill Saints without being a saint.</p><p>Unless one was like Lu Ming, who had extremely powerful laws and spirit bodies, one could not do it.</p><p>Otherwise, once the Saint power was used, it would be as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood, and the true essence could not resist it at all.</p><p>“Also, my soul power, what level has it reached?”</p><p>Lu Ming carefully sensed the soul in his sea of consciousness. He could feel that his soul force had increased by dozens of times.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he were to use the divine sword technique now, he could easily tear apart the soul of a perfected or even a pinnacle bright Saint.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming’s combat strength had undergone a huge change and he had achieved a qualitative breakthrough.</p><p>If Lu Ming had broken through normally, he would not have had such a great improvement. The main reason was that the fusion of the main body and the second body not only increased his soul force but also cultivated two Saint hearts. Therefore, Lu Ming could not estimate it.</p><p>“Perhaps this is a blessing in disguise!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>now that I’ve broken through to the Saint realm, I should be able to enter the primal Chaos Palace!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Back when he had obtained the chaos Scripture from the primal Chaos Hall, Earth One had told him that if he wanted their help, he had to at least break through the Saint realm and become a saint.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming had already broken through to the Saint realm.</p><p>Although Earth One and gold one were puppets, their strength was absolutely unfathomable and difficult to measure. If he could get the help of Earth One and the others, it would not be difficult to solve the siege of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>With a thought, the chaos token appeared in his hand. Then, he poured his Saint power into it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The chaos token buzzed and emitted a brilliant light. Then, a beam of light formed and enveloped Lu Ming. He felt that he was being carried by an irresistible force. It was as if he was traveling through the void, heading in a certain direction.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the space trembled. Lu Ming realized that he had arrived in a Grand Hall.</p><p>Primal Chaos Hall. He had finally returned to this place.</p><p>The space in front of him rippled, and a few figures appeared.</p><p>They were earth One and gold one.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the rest saluted Lu Ming when they saw him.</p><p>“Seniors, long time no see!”</p><p>Lu Ming returned the greeting.</p><p>the young master has finally broken through to the sage realm!</p><p>Earth one’s gaze was like lightning as he looked at Lu Ming, as if he could see through him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
