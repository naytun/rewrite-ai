In the end, he broke free of the shackles, recovered his cultivation, and killed all the three-eyed God race.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, he directly killed his way into the military camp. After a fierce battle, he finally died of exhaustion.</p><p>Of course, dying in battle here did not mean that they would really die.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw that Huang Ling, like long Chen, had also made her way to the military camp. In the end, she was surrounded and killed by many experts.</p><p>And…</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming only saw six people who dared to charge into the enemy’s camp.</p><p>As for the others, they either failed to break through the shackles, fled, or were too afraid to attack the enemy’s camp. They were all teleported away.</p><p>…..</p><p>Other than Lu Ming, there were only six people.</p><p>However, none of them could do what Lu Ming did, annihilating a large number of the enemy’s troops and killing the three-eyed God general in the end.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that different people with different cultivation levels would appear with different three-eyed gods.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation level was, the higher one’s cultivation level would be when they encountered a three-eyed God.</p><p>For example, in the military camp, the Supreme talents who reached the absolute Saint realm would become Emperor-to-be.</p><p>No one could cross so many realms and kill a strong enemy. Lu Ming had to borrow the power of the blood-eyed demonic ape and the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele to do so.</p><p>After he was done, the white-robed old man waved his hand and the images disappeared, this time, including you, a total of seven people passed the test. Your performance was the best. Since ancient times, no one could compare to you. So, congratulations on becoming the true inheritor of Hunyuan sect!</p><p>The white-robed old man smiled.</p><p>“We succeeded just like that?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>not bad, you’ve succeeded. It doesn’t look difficult, but it’s actually very, very difficult. In fact, there were people in ancient times with extremely strong combat strength who might have been able to do what you did, but most people didn’t choose to do so. Instead, they turned around and left. They didn’t attack the military camp. Without attacking the military camp, it’s a failure. No matter how strong their combat strength is, it’s useless!</p><p>The white-robed elder sighed, combat strength and talent aren’t the only requirements for Hunyuan sect’s successor. It also requires courage, or rather, a fearless spirit. If you don’t even dare to fight to the death when your family and friends are killed and can only retreat, then you’re too selfish. What’s the use of having strong combat strength? That kind of person might be able to become a peak expert, but he’s not what my Hunyuan sect needs!”</p><p>“Hunyuan sect, what’s the purpose of spending so much effort to choose a successor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Prepare for battle!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said. At this moment, his eyes shone with a brilliant light, and a terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>you’ve seen it for yourself. When the foreign tribes invaded, the people in the heaven realm were plunged into misery and the endless territories were occupied. For so many years, countless experts of the heaven realm have fought against the foreign tribes, and countless heroes have died in battle. Now, the heaven realm is almost completely occupied!</p><p>as for the alien races, they have already started to open up the passage to the primordial realm. When the time comes, the alien races will descend on the primordial realm. When that time comes, the primordial realm will follow in the footsteps of the heaven realm, with billions of corpses lying on the ground. No one will be able to stay out of it.</p><p>this battle was about to happen a long time ago. That’s why Hunyuan sect has been cultivating prodigies and experts for so many years, waiting for the final battle in the future!</p><p>The white-robed old man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Eggy had also said that the final battle was coming.</p><p>Back in the Azure continent, he had seen the Titan longhorn beetle guarding a pitch-black passage. Could it be that the other side of the passage was a foreign race?</p><p>If the foreign tribes were to descend, would his family and friends be annihilated like the previous tribes?</p><p>No, Lu Ming would never let this happen.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>in fact, it’s not just the Hunyuan sect. Back then, the strongest forces in the heaven realm were also doing this. Their inheritances were constantly flowing out. In fact, in ancient times, the primordial realm s human race didn’t know how to cultivate. The reason they became powerful later on was because the strongest forces in the heaven realm leaked out all kinds of inheritances, resulting in the primordial realm’s current situation!</p><p>The white-robed old man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the primordial realm’s cultivation methods were spread by a few forces in the heaven realm.</p><p>actually, many of the primordial realm’s ancient and powerful factions are disciples of the primordial chaos sect. Their ancestors all received the primordial chaos sect’s inheritance!</p><p>since ancient times, Hunyuan sect has been in a war for Providence and has been searching for inheritors. We have divided the inheritors into three levels: gold inheritors, silver inheritors, and bronze inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man explained.</p><p>“Then what level of inheritor am 1?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>golden inheritor is the highest level. Since ancient times, you’re the only one who has reached this level. Therefore, you’re the true inheritor of Hunyuan sect. The zongzi of Hunyuan sect will inherit the position of Hunyuan sect’s sect master in the future!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“Oh, how many people does Hunyuan sect have in the heaven realm?”</p><p>there are not many left. After so many years of war, not many people are still alive. Back then, almost all of the nine Hall Masters died in battle. You cultivate the chaos Scripture, so you should have obtained the inheritance of the chaos monarch. Back then, the chaos monarch was one of the strongest experts in the world, but he also died in battle!</p><p>The white-robed old man sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. There were not many people left. What was the use of inheriting the position of Hunyuan sect’s sect master?</p><p>you are a gold-ranked inheritor, so you have the right to see other people’s images. Other people have no right to see your images. Moreover, the lower-ranked inheritors have to listen to the higher-ranked inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>by the way, why didn’t 1 see bubbles, no, that space-time spirit mouse just now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming did not see bubbles in the images just now.</p><p>the space-time spirit mouse has a special identity. Her mother, the previous space-time spirit mouse, was one of the nine Hall Masters of the Hunyuan sect. So, she didn’t need to be tested. I took her to a place where the inheritance of the previous space-time spirit mouse is!</p><p>The white-robed old man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. It was a great opportunity for bubbles to obtain the inheritance of the previous generation of space-time spirit rats.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll take you to a place!”</p><p>The white-robed elder waved his hand and the environment shattered like a mirror before disappearing. The next moment, Lu Ming appeared in a Hall.</p><p>At the same time, in another Hall, Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the other five were gathered together. In front of them, a white-robed elder was floating in the air.</p><p>congratulations on passing the test and becoming Hunyuan sect’s Silver inheritors!</p><p>The white-robed old man said, and then explained some things.</p><p>The six people’s eyes flickered, but they didn’t say anything, waiting for the next part.</p><p>They were all prodigies of the major forces and knew more secrets than Lu Ming. They knew that there would definitely be benefits to becoming the Hunyuan sect’s inheritor.</p><p>now, I’ll reward each of you with a wisp of nebulous primordial chaos. When you break through to the Martial Emperor realm in the future and condense a Pocket World, you can refine the nebulous primordial chaos to make the pocket World even more stable and powerful!</p><p>The white-robed old man said as he raised his hand. On his hand, there were six streams of Qi that were constantly flowing, as if they had a spirit..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
