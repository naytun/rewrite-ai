He did not kill them. The two three-eyed gods became his perfect shield.</p><p>...</p><p>With these two three-eyed gods around, the other three-eyed gods wouldn’t come looking for him.</p><p>As time passed, more and more of the three-eyed gods and blood-eyed demonic apes died.</p><p>Even the most powerful great saints were dying in battle.</p><p>The battle between the three-eyed God and the terrifying blood-eyed demonic ape had reached its climax. Both sides were great saints in the Great Perfection realm. Both sides were injured in the fierce battle.</p><p>In the end, it was the three-eyed God that was stronger. After a few hundred moves, he managed to kill the blood-eyed demonic ape. However, the blood-eyed demonic ape fought back with all its might, shattering the three-eyed God’s armor and piercing through his heart, heavily injuring him.</p><p>At this time, the three-eyed God race was starting to gain the upper hand.</p><p>…..</p><p>After all, the three-eyed God race had more people and more experts.</p><p>However, the blood-eyed demonic apes were already in a state of madness. In their eyes, there was only killing.</p><p>He charged at the three-eyed God race without a care for his own life. Even if he died, he would drag the other down with him.</p><p>When the last blood-eyed demonic ape was killed, the three-eyed God race also suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Out of the thirty thousand three-eyed gods, only ten thousand remained. Twenty thousand were killed by the frenzied blood-eyed demonic apes, and the remaining three-eyed gods were all injured.</p><p>“Why isn’t this guy dead yet? attack and kill him!”</p><p>The three-eyed God in armor roared and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was still engaged in battle with the two three-eyed gods.</p><p>“You’re the ones who will die!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura suddenly skyrocketed. Light spots bloomed on his body, and more than a hundred holy weapons appeared.</p><p>The combat weapon Qi gathered on the combat sword in Lu Ming’s hand. The sword glowed brightly. With a single slash, it destroyed the attack of a great sage minor mastery three-eyed God. With an unstoppable momentum, it charged towards the other party.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The other party was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming’s combat strength to increase so suddenly. It was too late to Dodge.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The three-eyed God was split in half by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming bellowed as he shot out two rays of sword radiance that pierced into the other three-eyed God’s body. The three-eyed God’s body stiffened for a moment before Lu Ming’s sword swept out and cut him in two.</p><p>In an instant, two great saints at the initial mastery were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>When Lu Ming had broken through to the sage realm, he had almost killed an expert in the great sage initial mastery. Now that he had reached the perfected bright Saint realm, killing an ordinary expert in the great sage initial mastery was as easy as cutting vegetables.</p><p>damn it, this person was hiding his strength. Let’s attack together and kill him!</p><p>The armored three-eyed God shouted.</p><p>One by one, the three-eyed gods stepped into the air and charged toward Lu Ming. Before they even reached him, the destructive light in their eyes was already shooting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>More than a hundred holy weapons swirled around Lu Ming, blocking the destructive light. At the same time, he charged toward the group of three-eyed gods.</p><p>With a loud shout, the godly sword technique burst out along with the sound waves. All those below the Supreme Saint realm let out shrill screams. Their souls were destroyed by Lu Ming, and their bodies fell to the ground like raindrops.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, over a hundred three-eyed gods were killed.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s hands were waving non-stop, and nine sealing gates appeared, sealing a large number of three-eyed gods.</p><p>Even a great saint would be sealed for a moment.</p><p>In an instant, it represented life and death.</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward. His sword was thousands of meters long. With a single slash, hundreds of three-eyed gods were killed. Among them, there were two great saints in the initial realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, a chaos Empyrean seal formed. It was extremely huge, like an ancient divine mountain, and it pressed down.</p><p>“Quickly run!”</p><p>Many of the three-eyed gods were scared out of their wits, and they began to flee in a frenzy.</p><p>However, under the suppression of the primal Chaos Empyrean seal, the three-eyed gods were obliterated one after another.</p><p>Anyone below the Supreme Saint realm was like an ant in front of Lu Ming. They had no way of fighting back.</p><p>“Those below the Supreme Saint realm, retreat. Supreme Saint realm, join forces and kill him!”</p><p>The three-eyed God wearing battle armor roared.</p><p>All the three-eyed gods below the Supreme Saint realm retreated at top speed, while the other burly three-eyed gods stepped forward and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>All of them were great saints, and there were dozens of them.</p><p>Dozens of destructive lights were shot out, causing Lu Ming’s expression to turn very grave.</p><p>So many great saints had joined forces. There were great saints in the minor mastery, great mastery, and even great saint peak. This force was too strong.</p><p>Lu Ming could only retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure soared into the sky and dodged the attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The great saints all charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Tai Chi disk array appeared. Lu Ming controlled the array Dao law and countless runes formed, entering the Tai Chi disk array. The Tai Chi disk array enlarged rapidly, and the pattern of the yin-yang fish formed on it, pressing down.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The attacks of the three-eyed gods all landed on the formation plate, and the formation plate trembled before being sent flying.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming pointed with his finger and burst out with his strongest power.</p><p>He pointed a finger at a peak great saint three-eyed God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of the chaotic finger tribulation at fifty percent was so powerful that even a peak Supreme Saint couldn’t resist it. He spat out blood and retreated, his body almost cracking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he charged toward the great saint peak.</p><p>Only those at the peak of the great saint realm or above could pose a threat to Lu Ming. He was not afraid of those at the great saint realm.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had to get rid of the great saint peak first.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>On the way, a great sage initial mastery and a great sage great mastery blocked in front of him, their battleaxes swinging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A yin-yang fish pattern appeared on the Tai Chi formation disk. Then, the yin-yang fish pattern turned into a pair of yin-yang fish swords and slashed at the two of them.</p><p>The great saint lower tier three-eyed God was killed instantly, and the great saint upper tier almost died as well. A long gash was left on his body as he retreated frantically.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him retreat? He slashed out with his sword and ended this person.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming’s figure had already appeared before the three-eyed God at the peak of the great saint realm.</p><p>The three-eyed God was severely injured by Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation. He could barely put up any resistance. With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming’s five great saint weapons shot out and killed the three-eyed God.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Lu Ming would not have been able to kill a Supreme Saint pinnacle being so easily. However, these three-eyed Celestials were all injured from the intense battle with the blood-eyed demonic ape. They were no longer at their peak. That was why Lu Ming managed to kill one of them with lightning speed.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming did not stop and charged toward the other three-eyed gods.</p><p>There were only three Supreme Saints on the other side. Now that one had died, there were two more.</p><p>Of course, there was also a general, but he was more seriously injured..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
