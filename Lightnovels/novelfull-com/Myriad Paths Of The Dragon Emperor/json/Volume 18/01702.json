Evil spirit actually had an absolute Saint hidden here as well, and they had not made a move before.</p><p>Demon Castle Lord, I didn’t expect you to come here. Fortunately, I was prepared and brought the absolute Saint just in case!</p><p>Elder mo hun said coldly, but his expression was still ugly.</p><p>The sudden arrival of the demon castle’s Lord had already disrupted his plan.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then did you expect us to do that?”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice came from the distance. Then, a sword light crossed the endless void and appeared on the top of the Cang Mountain.</p><p>The sword light turned, and suddenly, three great saints from evil spirit were killed. Blood splattered on the spot, and the others were terrified and retreated frantically.</p><p>it’s the life and death Sword! The sect leader is here!</p><p>The people of the life-and-death Sword sect were ecstatic.</p><p>Only then did everyone see clearly that the sword light just now was a black-and-white longsword that was filled with a terrifying sword power.</p><p>In the distance, two figures appeared in the air.</p><p>One of them was a middle-aged man wearing a black and white robe. The black and white longsword flew into his hand.</p><p>This man was the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>The other one was a gentle-looking old man.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>The person who appeared with the life and death Sword sect leader was the cloud Dragon Valley master, Lu Ming’s master.</p><p>“Master, it’s master!”</p><p>“Didn’t shizun have something to do? Why are you here?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain’s yang tianzong exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Elder mo Hun’s face was extremely ugly.</p><p>How did this happen? Why were there so many strong people in the Cang mountains?</p><p>The sect leader of the life and death Sword sect, the Lord of the demon Castle, how could such an Overlord appear in the Cang mountains for no reason?</p><p>Although the treasure sealing assembly was important, but in history, there had never been a sect master who came, right?</p><p>After all, it was a competition between the younger generation. Even if the sect leader came, he would not be of much help.</p><p>attack! Annihilate the evil spirit cult!</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect said. He took a step forward, and the sword light shook the sky as he charged toward elder mo hun.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Lord of Demon Castle charged towards the absolute Saint from evil spirit cult.</p><p>As for the cloud Dragon Valley master, he took a step and appeared on the peak of the Cang Mountain. Sword-light bloomed in his hand and poured out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The two great saints of evil spirit were killed without any resistance in front of the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Then, with a sweep of the sword light, more than a dozen bright Saints were killed.</p><p>He could not put up any resistance and could only be slaughtered. Lu Ming was once again shocked by the strength of the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>Could the cloud Dragon Valley master also be an absolute Saint?</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Evil Spirit’s great saint roared, knowing that he had lost.</p><p>“Kill them all, don’t leave a single one alive!”</p><p>The great saints from more than a dozen sects roared and launched a counterattack. They attacked each other, not allowing them to retreat.</p><p>At the scene, the people from the intentionless saber sect had the ugliest expressions. They knew that they were done for and wanted to break out of the encirclement crazily. However, how could the powerhouses of the other sects let them break through? they were entangled with them.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master held a long sword in his hand. His expression was gentle, but with every step he took, an expert died. It was the same for great saints and bright Saints.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the number of Supreme Saints who had died at the hands of the cloud Dragon Valley master reached seven.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A wooden middle-aged man, who had reached the Supreme Saint realm, was cut in half by the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>At this time, a scream came from the sky.</p><p>Elder mo Hun’s head was cut off by the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>Although elder mo Hun’s cultivation was profound, he had been severely injured 80000 years ago. Later, his body was destroyed by Lu Ming’s fragment of the prison-suppressing stele. Although he was lucky to find a suitable person to possess, his cultivation was far from his peak. He was no match for the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect.</p><p>After his physical body was cut, elder mo Hun’s soul escaped. It was the image of an old man, exactly the same as the one Lu Ming had seen.</p><p>Elder mo Hun’s soul tried to escape, but the sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect slashed his sword and destroyed his soul.</p><p>ah, the evil spirit Church avenged me!</p><p>Elder mo hun let out an unwilling roar as his soul vanished into thin air.</p><p>This expert from 80000 years ago, an old monster who had struggled at death’s door for 80000 years, had finally lost his soul.</p><p>“Brother Yun, you’re too slow!”</p><p>After killing elder mo hun, the sect leader of the life and death Sword sect stepped down. A terrifying sword light bloomed from his hand and turned into thousands of sword Qi, attacking the evil spirit cultivators.</p><p>One by one, evil Spirit’s people were harvested like wheat, falling in large numbers.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled and took a step forward. He appeared in front of a Supreme Saint and killed him with a single strike.</p><p>With the addition of the life and death Sword sect and the cloud Dragon Valley master, there was no longer any suspense in this battle. They couldn’t even escape and were all killed soon.</p><p>Only the intentionless saber sect’s people were left. Each and every one of them was pale as they were surrounded by the experts of the other sects.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>High up in the sky, the Lord of Demon Castle was still fighting with the powerhouses of evil spirit cult, and it was difficult to tell who was winning.</p><p>“I’ll go and help him!”</p><p>The sect leader’s killing intent was cold. He turned into a beam of sword light and shot into the sky, leaving a terrifying sword mark in the sky.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>arghh! the evil spirit cultivator screamed as he was stabbed. He was almost cut in half by the sect leader.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect had terrifying combat strength. Once he used the life-and-death Sword technique, he would live and you would die!</p><p>His combat strength was obviously stronger than the demon castle’s Lord and the evil spirit cult powerhouse.</p><p>As the sword light flashed, the evil spirit expert’s arm was cut off.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Lord of Monster Castle was as large as a mountain. His golden hair was shining and suffused with Grand Sun flames.</p><p>The sun god Lion was undoubtedly a terrifying divine beast. His roar shook the other party’s soul.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, he struck out with his claws and struck the other party, causing him to spit out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Then, the sect leader’s life and death Sword slashed down, directly cutting the other party in half.</p><p>An absolute Saint had fallen!</p><p>At this point, all the people from evil spirit had been annihilated.</p><p>Now that there was no Emperor in the Azure continent, an absolute Saint was the most powerful being at the peak. They were extremely powerful. Only the King of the Saints was an absolute Saint. They were much stronger than Supreme Saints.</p><p>The appearance of an absolute Saint could change the situation.</p><p>“If an absolute Saint is so powerful, what about a martial Supreme? The Emperor of martial arts, looking down on the world, I really don’t know how terrifying he is.”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>“You guys … Why are you here?”</p><p>A Supreme Saint of the intentionless saber sect asked with an unwilling expression.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
