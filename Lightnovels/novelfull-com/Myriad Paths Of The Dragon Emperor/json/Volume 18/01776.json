He had broken through the shackles in his body and his aura was rising crazily.</p><p>In the beginning, it was the initial bright Saint, then the great mastery, then the peak, then the great circle, and finally, it stopped.</p><p>The seal in Lu Ming’s body was broken and all his combat strength was restored instantly.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of him, the two three-eyed God race experts ‘expressions changed. Then, they roared and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and the divine sword technique was released along with the sound waves, blasting into the other party’s body.</p><p>The two three-eyed God race bright Saints ‘bodies suddenly stiffened, and their eyes revealed a look of disbelief. Then, the light in their eyes dimmed, and their bodies limply fell to the ground.</p><p>Their souls had been destroyed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With a single shout, he killed two bright Saints, attracting the attention of the other three-eyed gods.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>The great saint three-eyed God roared, and a dozen three-eyed gods charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent. His cold killing intent spread out. He used the divine sword technique. His soul was beating, forming a terrifying attack and spreading out.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had broken through continuously and reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. Naturally, his soul power had increased greatly as well. Compared to before, it had increased by a large margin. When he used the divine sword technique, the power was astonishing.</p><p>Just like the two three-eyed gods before him, the ten three-eyed gods that were charging at Lu Ming were frozen in place. Their souls were destroyed and they fell to the ground.</p><p>what?! the expression of the three-eyed God at the great saint stage changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He had come personally. A destructive light shot out from the third eye between his brows. It exuded a terrifying fluctuation as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>As the Laws of Chaos circulated, Lu Ming pointed with his finger. He had used all his strength. The chaos finger tribulation at 50% of its full power was unimaginably terrifying.</p><p>&Nbsp; a massive finger like the finger of a God appeared and pointed at the great saint three-eyed God. The destructive light of the great saint three-eyed God was instantly destroyed by the primal Chaos tribulation finger, but the finger continued on its path and appeared in front of the great saint three-eyed God in an instant.</p><p>The terrifying power made the three eyed Spirit master’s face change. He roared and kept swinging his axe while setting up layers of defense on his body.</p><p>However, it was useless. When the primal Chaos tribulation finger landed, the battleaxe in his hand exploded, and all his defenses were shattered like tofu.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>He only had time to let out a roar before his burly body was turned into ashes by the chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>“Commander!”</p><p>The rest of the three-eyed God race were all shocked. Their commander was a Supreme Saint expert, but he was killed in a single strike.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His killing intent surged like a tide. His body glowed, and holy weapons flew out from the light spots.</p><p>These Saint weapons transformed into streams of death as they shot out toward the three-eyed gods.</p><p>Lu Ming showed no mercy to these three-eyed gods. There was only one word for him: kill!</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current realm, he was invincible against anyone below the Supreme Saint realm and could be killed easily.</p><p>More than a hundred Saint weapons turned into more than a hundred rays of light. With a single charge, one, or even two or retreated.</p><p>three, three-eyed God race beings were killed.</p><p>Large groups of three-eyed gods fell to the ground.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>let’s go! Call the general’s Vanguard to come and kill this man!</p><p>The three-eyed race was scared, and many of them frantically retreated.</p><p>“Today, none of you will be able to escape!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming said coldly. He transformed into a god of death and stood in the air. A Dragon’s Roar came from his body as devouring power burst forth, enveloping the entire tribe and all the three-eyed gods.</p><p>All of the three-eyed gods below the Saint realm screamed in fear as their bodies shriveled up at a visible rate, turning into dried corpses.</p><p>Although the sages were not turned into mummies, their bodies were affected by the devouring force and they could not move. What awaited them was Lu Ming’s merciless slaughter.</p><p>The Holy weapon danced in the air, and one by one, the three-eyed Celestials were killed. Not long after, the three-eyed Celestials who had come this time were basically all dead. Corpses covered the ground of the tribe, leaving only one alive. Lu Ming knocked him unconscious and kept him in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>There were only a few dozen people in the entire tribe who stood there in a daze.</p><p>These were the few tribesmen who had survived.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. It was too tragic. He hated it in his heart. The speed at which he broke through the shackles was too slow. If he could have done it earlier, Xia Hu, Xia Hua, uncle li, and the others would not have died.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>A sigh filled with sorrow spread throughout the tribe.</p><p>This was an old man who had survived. He was an elder of the tribe.</p><p>“Elder Liu, what are you planning to do next?”</p><p>Lu Ming walked to elder Liu’s side and asked.</p><p>now, the three-eyed demon has broken through the void and invaded the heaven realm. I heard that a large area of the heaven realm has been occupied. We plan to bury our tribesmen first, then go to the big tribes!</p><p>Elder Liu said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“Elder Liu, how many years has it been since the three-eyed demons invaded the heavenly realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s been several hundred years. I heard that countless experts of our heaven realm fought with the three-eyed demon and were all killed. Sigh, this is a calamity!”</p><p>Elder Liu sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming had countless thoughts in his mind.</p><p>According to his understanding, the three-eyed God race had already invaded the heavenly realm for countless years, but only a few hundred years had passed here. Perhaps all of this was real and a projection of the ancient era.</p><p>“Whether it’s true or false, in my heart, all of this is real!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He then buried the tribe members with the rest of the people.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, come with us and join a big clan!”</p><p>After the burial, elder Liu said.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. I’m not leaving. You guys can leave. I still have my own things to do!</p><p>Elder Liu shook his head and didn’t try to persuade him any further. After saying goodbye, he left with the rest of the tribe.</p><p>Lu Ming stood alone in front of the tomb. After a long time, he took out a pot of wine and poured it on the ground.”Whether this place is real or fake, whether it’s a projection of the ancient times or it really happened, I’ll take revenge for you!”</p><p>“A man should do some things and not do some things!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and the three-eyed God that he had kept in the mountain and river diagram appeared in front of the tomb. He had already woken up and was looking at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>“Tell me, where are your other troops?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked indifferently.</p><p>“You want to find our Vanguard? The general of our Vanguard is an expert in the great sage perfection realm.”</p><p>The three-eyed man said.</p><p>“Speak! Where is he?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was calm as he continued to ask.</p><p>“80000 li to the west of here!”</p><p>The three-eyed God replied. He would not hide anything from Lu Ming. He knew that he would die for sure, but there were many experts in the vanguard. Lu Ming would be sending himself to his death if he went.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
