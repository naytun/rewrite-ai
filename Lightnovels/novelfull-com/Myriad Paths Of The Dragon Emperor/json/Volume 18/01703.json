Their luck was too bad. They just happened to meet the master of Cloud Dragon Valley, the Lord of Demon Castle, and the sect master of life and death Sword sect.</p><p>...</p><p>“Do you think it’s a coincidence that we’re here? We’ve arrived long ago and are just waiting for your intentionless saber sect to make a move. If you don’t make a move, how are you going to suppress the intentionless saber sect in the future?”</p><p>The sect leader of the life-death Sword sect said coldly.</p><p>“What? You guys arrived long ago? Could it be that you already knew that my intentionless saber sect had already surrendered to evil spirit?”</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the intentionless saber sect was in disbelief.</p><p>Their actions were already very secretive.</p><p>of course, we’ve been investigating this matter all this time!</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley master continued, ” three years ago, my disciple, Lu Ming, was on his way back to Dragon God Valley from the Cang mountains when he was assassinated by evil spirit. According to him, the intentionless saber sect was among the ones who attacked. So, all these years, the demon castle’s Castle Master, the life and death Sword sect’s sect master, and I have been secretly investigating. As expected, we found some clues. However, you guys hid it very well, and we don’t have any evidence. So, we can only wait for you guys to take action!</p><p>Many people were shocked. So that was the case.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming was actually assassinated by evil spirit.</p><p>three years ago. I see. At that time, we did not expect Lu Ming to survive. We tried our best, but God did not bless us!</p><p>The great sage of the intentionless saber sect heaved a long sigh. He did not expect that everything would be ruined in the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming did not die three years ago and informed the cloud Dragon Valley master of the possibility of the intentionless saber sect colluding with evil spirit sect, today’s incident would not have happened. Their plan would definitely have been carried out smoothly.</p><p>“Just kill them, there’s no need to talk to them!”</p><p>The demon Fort’s Lord spoke, and his eyes revealed a ferocious look. His golden claws reached out and grabbed at the people from the intentionless saber sect.</p><p>The people of the intentionless saber sect were unwilling to give up. They wanted to resist, but in the hands of an absolute Saint, resistance was futile. In the end, they were killed one by one.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, are you guys alright?”</p><p>The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley stepped forward and came before Lu Ming, Longyuan mountain, and yang tianzong.</p><p>“Master, if you don’t make a move, we’ll be finished!”</p><p>Yang tianzong said with a bitter face.</p><p>“You, are you blaming your master for being late?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master laughed as he scolded.</p><p>“Your disciple wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>Yang tianzong said.</p><p>this time, it’s of utmost importance to lure the people of the intentionless saber sect out. If we had acted earlier, the people of the intentionless saber sect would definitely not have made a move. Of course, if you guys were really in danger, how could I not have helped? ”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming, Longyuan mountain and the rest nodded.</p><p>Indeed, if the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others had made their move earlier, the people of the intentionless saber sect would definitely have bided their time.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you’ve done well this time. It looks like you’ve gained a lot from the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master looked at Lu Ming with a satisfied expression.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming’s performance had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>He had seen Lu Ming’s battle with the divine Son.</p><p>“I still have to thank master!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Someone said. Lu Ming looked over and saw that it was someone from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>This time, the Tian Shen sect had suffered a great loss. A great saint had been killed and more than half of the disciples had been killed.</p><p>Most of the people who came to the treasure sealing assembly were the younger generation of disciples. They were the elites of the younger generation. Such a huge loss was a heavy blow to the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>One could imagine that in the future, there would be a gap in the experts of this generation in the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>It was very terrifying for a force to not have a successor with fresh blood.</p><p>“Let’s go back!”</p><p>Then, one by one, the sects began to return. They had to report today’s matter to their sects as soon as possible.</p><p>Some of them expressed their gratitude to the cloud Dragon Valley master, the life and death Sword sect master, and the demon Castle Lord before leaving.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming released Zi Feng, Tian Chui, and the rest from the mountain and river diagram. When they learned of the situation, they were all extremely shocked.</p><p>“Alright, let’s return to Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>The valley master waved his hand, and a sword flew out of his hand. It rapidly grew to ten thousand meters long and a few hundred meters wide. Thousands of Dragon God Valley disciples stepped on the sword and headed for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s speed was astonishing. Even with thousands of people, he was still very fast. In less than a day, they had returned to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>A few days later, news of the battle at Cang Mountain quickly spread throughout the entire Cang region, shocking countless people.</p><p>No one had expected that this time’s treasure sealing assembly would be so exciting and soul-shaking.</p><p>First of all, as a Dark Horse, Lu Ming had risen to power and killed Luo shuihan, winning first place in the fixed treasure auction.</p><p>After that, he fought the divine Son and had a great battle. Lu Ming had a breakthrough in the battle and killed the divine Son.</p><p>From now on, Lu Ming was the number one genius of the Azure continent.</p><p>After that, there was even the incident of evil spirit religion besieging all the major sects. In the great battle, the intentionless saber sect even rebelled.</p><p>All of these things were unbelievable and shocking.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, his name had truly shaken the Azure region and was remembered by countless people.</p><p>Another ten days passed, and a piece of news was sent out, sweeping through all parts of the Azure continent.</p><p>The 12 sects of the Azure state joined forces and sent out a huge Army to attack the intentionless saber sect. They intended to encircle and annihilate the intentionless saber sect. However, by the time the experts of the 12 sects arrived, the intentionless saber sect had already been completely deserted. All the experts had already retreated, leaving behind only a few people with low cultivation.</p><p>Where did the experts of the intentionless saber sect go?</p><p>However, some people guessed that the intentionless saber sect was most likely still in the Cang region.</p><p>Furthermore, there was another guess that was even more shocking.</p><p>Since the intentionless saber sect could side with evil spirit, would the other twelve top sects in the Azure region also side with evil spirit?</p><p>Could the intentionless saber sect be hiding in this sect?</p><p>Once this guess was made, the Azure continent was shaken. The twelve top sects were on guard against each other.</p><p>Because, this guess was very likely. For a time, the various sects in the Azure continent were in an uproar.</p><p>However, there was one thing that would not change. From now on, the Azure continent would no longer have thirteen top sects. There would only be twelve.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been in seclusion in Cloud Dragon Valley to stabilize his cultivation. He was also trying his best to recover his second body.</p><p>A month after the battle of Cang Mountain, he had refined his second body and had completely recovered. As for his severed arm, it had long since grown back.</p><p>In fact, the cultivation of the inscription clone had even improved.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming’s main body had already reached the level of the law tank. The main body and the clone were the same person and had the same experience. The clone was not far from the law tank.</p><p>As for bubbles, she seemed to be on the verge of a breakthrough as well. She was sleeping soundly in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming paid a visit to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you want the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master asked in surprise.</p><p>Yes, Master. My other bloodline is the prison-guarding stele. The fragments of the prison-guarding stele are very useful to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
