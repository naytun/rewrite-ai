Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>Then, seven Emperor-level experts stepped out and rushed into the mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mountain of pill furnaces trembled continuously, and rays of light burst out.</p><p>The Emperor-level powerhouses also made their moves. The entire area burst out with a terrifying roar. The sky and earth shook, and the entire world was shaking wildly.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>Those below the Emperor level all retreated.</p><p>It was too terrifying when an Emperor-level expert made a move. If they were even slightly affected, they would definitely end up in ashes.</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled. The pill Furnace Mountain emitted a brilliant light that was surrounded by halos. That was the light of pill Qi, but it could explode with shocking power and was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Moreover, the shaking became more and more intense, and the mountain of alchemy furnace became a little illusory, as if it would break through the sky at any time.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>With a flash, the Emperor-level figures all retreated out of the mountain.</p><p>1 can’t force my way in. Otherwise, this pill Furnace Mountain will break through the air and escape again!</p><p>Someone said with a frown.</p><p>“Then what should 1 do?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>it seems that this Great Yan elixir Palace doesn’t welcome Emperor-ranked people. It seems that I can only send people below Emperor-ranked in to try!</p><p>An Emperor-level figure spoke. The others fell silent for a moment before nodding their heads.</p><p>Emperor-ranked figures couldn’t enter at all. Even if they all attacked, the mountain of pill furnaces would probably disappear into the void. At that time, they wouldn’t be able to obtain anything. They could only send people below the Emperor-ranked to try.</p><p>Following that, these Emperor-ranked figures began to send out people from their respective powers who were below Emperor-ranked.</p><p>In the beginning, they sent emperors-to-be, but they were all blasted out without exception. However, the strength of the Halos was much weaker. They could only blast emperors-to-be out, but at most, they would be injured. Their power was far less than when they were dealing with Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Otherwise, he could kill a group of Emperor-to-be in an instant.</p><p>After that, sending absolute Saints was still useless.</p><p>The emperors were very patient and they slowly tested it out. Finally, they got it.</p><p>Only the younger generation below the age of 50 could enter, and the Halo was the weakest. Some geniuses could completely withstand it and enter smoothly.</p><p>Immediately, the major forces began to dispatch their younger generation.</p><p>Soon, all the paragons were gathered here.</p><p>Not only that, other than the heaven’s favorites from the ancient Moon Holy Land, there were also many heaven’s favorites from the ordinary Emperor-ranked forces.</p><p>Lu Ming also mixed in with some young people and did not attract any attention.</p><p>you guys go in. Find an opportunity to destroy Phoenix Palace and some of the divine elephant sect’s geniuses, especially Phoenix spirit and Long Chen!</p><p>Some of the geniuses of the WAN clan were standing beside the Emperor-ranked experts of the WAN clan. At this moment, the Emperor-ranked experts of the WAN clan were transmitting messages to them. Their voices were extremely cold.</p><p>“Yes, Lord Martial Emperor!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s geniuses nodded.</p><p>don’t worry. I’ve already contacted the people from the Sirius tower, the celestial Bird Palace, and the ziji sect. If they dare to kill the WAN family’s prodigy with Lu Ming, they’ll die without a doubt!</p><p>The Emperor level expert from the WAN clan coldly spoke.</p><p>A cold glint flashed across the eyes of the WAN family’s paragons.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Emperor level expert from the WAN clan waved his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The WAN family’s elites all flew toward the mountain of pill furnaces.</p><p>At the same time, the heaven’s pride experts of the other forces also rushed toward the mountain. Lu Ming mixed in with the heaven’s pride experts of the ordinary Emperor-ranked forces and also rushed toward the mountain.</p><p>Many young geniuses rushed into the mountain, and the mountain of pill furnaces also emitted layers of light.</p><p>However, these halos were much weaker in comparison.</p><p>Lu Ming only felt a slight numbness in his body. He seemed to be able to resist the power of the Halo very easily.</p><p>However, even though he was relaxed, not everyone was so relaxed. Some of the young men with weak talents and combat strength had their expressions change drastically. Their bodies trembled and they retreated rapidly out of the range of the mountain.</p><p>Some people had been eliminated before they even entered. Their expressions were ugly, but there were still many people who resisted the pressure and went into the depths of the mountain. Not long after, they entered the mountain and disappeared into the clouds and mist, disappearing from the sight of outsiders.</p><p>“Who will be the one to obtain the inheritance of the Dayan elixir Palace?”</p><p>Everyone pondered and revealed looks of anticipation as they waited quietly.</p><p>The mountain of alchemy furnaces occupied a vast area. After Lu Ming and the rest entered, they were surrounded by white fog and their vision was not very good. The mountain of alchemy furnaces was still very far away from them.</p><p>Everyone displayed their figures and leaped away, disappearing into the vast clouds.</p><p>Lu Ming also dashed toward the mountain of alchemy furnaces.</p><p>However, after running for half an hour, they were still very far from the mountain of pill furnaces.</p><p>As for the people who had entered, they had long since scattered. Looking around, not a single person could be seen.</p><p>from the outside, it doesn’t look very far. 1 didn’t expect it to be so far after 1 entered!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself and continued to move forward.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming suddenly stopped. He saw a few figures in front of him. They were the WAN family.</p><p>“These people from the WAN family, what are they up to? Let’s follow and see!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted. He restrained his aura and followed them quietly.</p><p>The elites of the WAN family headed in one direction. Not long after, they set up an ambush at the edge of a Valley.</p><p>Not long after, other people appeared and also laid in ambush nearby.</p><p>it’s the people from the Skywolf tower and the purple Extreme sect!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Later on, he saw some people from the heavenly Bird Palace. These four forces were the ones who had established the ten thousand spirit exchange, and they had a good relationship with each other. What were they trying to do by sneaking around?</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming found out.</p><p>In front of him, there were five or six figures running over.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit, Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Among those figures were Phoenix spirit and Long Chen. As for the others, they were obviously the paragons of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect.</p><p>The WAN family had laid an ambush here to deal with Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>“You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He suddenly shouted,” “Kill!”</p><p>His voice spread far and wide, causing Feng Ling and Long Chen’s expressions to change. They could not help but stop.</p><p>we haven’t entered the encirclement yet. Which idiot is shouting?”</p><p>The WAN clan’s heaven’s favorites all had gloomy expressions as they cursed.</p><p>The people from the four forces were hiding in different places, so they thought it was someone from another force.</p><p>The people from the other forces were the same, thinking that it was called by another force.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes were like lightning as he looked around.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The WAN family’s sovereign flew out and appeared in front of Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>Since a surprise attack didn’t work, he could only attack directly.</p><p>“The WAN family!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s face darkened.</p><p>“And US!”</p><p>As the voices rang out, the geniuses of the other three forces appeared. In a flash, they surrounded Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>Wan family, Sirius tower, heavenly Bird Palace, Purple Extreme sect, what do you want to do?”</p><p>Huang Ling said coldly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
