And Xiangxiang and the others!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a worried look.</p><p>bubble, you enter the mountain and river diagram first. I’m going back to Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Pao Pao.</p><p>Pao Pao nodded and returned to the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body began to transform. In the end, he turned into a dark-skinned young man. His aura had also changed greatly.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming headed in the direction of the Azure continent.</p><p>Lu Ming could not feel at ease leaving just like that.</p><p>He had to find out the whereabouts of Cloud Dragon Valley master, Xie nianqing, Xiangxiang, Tian Chui, and the others. If he left now, he would leave behind a demon in his heart, which would have a great impact on his future cultivation.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s cultivation base, as long as he did not encounter an absolute Saint, he should not be able to see through his disguise. He just had to avoid an absolute Saint.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and flew at top speed. Along the way, he did not encounter anyone from evil spirit cult or the DI family.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the place where the cloud Dragon Valley master had stopped.</p><p>It was a desolate place. The ground was filled with deep sword marks that criss-crossed and extended for thousands of miles. It could be seen how intense the battle was.</p><p>Lu Ming even saw traces of blood at one spot.</p><p>“How is it, master?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s worry grew and he left the place. Not long after, he arrived near the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect was very peaceful. There were people going in and out. It looked peaceful, but Lu Ming saw a few figures in golden robes. They were obviously disciples of the DI family.</p><p>It seemed like jiuxiao sword sect was already under evil Spirit’s control.</p><p>Lu Ming left the place and headed south.</p><p>&Nbsp; along the way, he passed by a few powerful sects and observed them in secret. He found that these sects were all controlled by evil spirit. It was obvious that many people had restrictions placed on them and had to listen to evil Spirit’s orders.</p><p>It was obvious that evil spirit had already taken full control of all the major forces in the Azure continent.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming arrived at the vicinity of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming did not enter the Dragon God Valley. Instead, he waited outside.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He saw a ‘familiar face’- the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>it seems that the evil spirit cult has also taken down Dragon God Valley. How are Xiangxiang and the others? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely worried. He restrained his aura and watched from afar.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect looked gloomy as he flew toward the North and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to wait. The next day, he saw a group of people flying out of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He saw Zi Feng.</p><p>The group of people flew into the distance with Lu Ming following them from a distance.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng!”</p><p>After they were a distance away from Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Zi Feng.</p><p>After hearing Lu Ming’s voice, Zi Feng’s body trembled but he quickly regained his composure.</p><p>I suddenly remembered that I have something to do. I need to go back to Dragon God Valley. You guys go ahead!</p><p>Zi Feng and the others said.</p><p>The others nodded and continued to fly, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, Zi Feng started to look around.</p><p>senior brother Zi Feng, I’m in a Valley to your left!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang in Zi Feng’s ears.</p><p>Zi Feng’s figure moved and he flew to the left. He flew into a Valley and saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, I heard that you’ve escaped. Many sect Masters from evil spirit sect and sky demon sect are looking for you. Why did you come back? it’s very dangerous!</p><p>Zi Feng said worriedly.</p><p>senior brother Zi Feng, has the evil spirit cult already occupied Dragon God Valley? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Zi Feng sighed. more than ten days ago, a large number of evil spirit cultivators descended upon Dragon God Valley. Most of the disciples in Dragon God Valley were captured. The other party has set up a restriction on our spirit God!</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng, do you know how Tian Chui and my disciple Lu Xiangxiang are doing?” Lu Ming’s heart tightened.</p><p>“Junior Brother doesn’t need to worry about this. At that time, the valley master saw the opportunity early and took Xiangxiang Beila, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin a step ahead of time to rush out of Dragon God Valley. I don’t know where they are now. But I heard that evil spirit has been looking for him, so he should be fine!”</p><p>“It’s a pity that most of the others were captured when they escaped!”</p><p>Zi Feng laughed bitterly.</p><p>“He escaped?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt relieved.</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley’s Valley master also knew about Xiangxiang Beila’s talent. He must have brought Xiangxiang Beila, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin to escape the moment he realized that something was wrong.</p><p>A sect master like ice Dragon Valley master naturally knew how to make a decision. At the critical moment, he would naturally take away the most talented person. Only then would there be hope.</p><p>senior brother Zi Feng, do you know how my master, the cloud Dragon Valley master, is doing? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Zi Feng nodded and said, ” I’ve heard some news in secret. When you went to annihilate evil spirit, you were ambushed by the DI family. Most of your people were captured and controlled by evil spirit. Only a few were killed.</p><p>I heard that your master was seriously injured and was finally placed under a restriction by evil spirit!</p><p>“Master is fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was good that his master was fine. He was just being controlled by the other party. Lu Ming would save him sooner or later.</p><p>“Senior brother, what else have you heard? for example, how many people have escaped?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m not sure either. It seems that many people have been caught, such as the sect master of the heaven seat King and the Lord of the demon Castle. However, our Ice Dragon patriarch seems to have escaped as well. The sect master of the life-and-death Sword sect has also escaped!</p><p>Zi Feng muttered.</p><p>“Has the Ice Dragon patriarch also escaped?”</p><p>Lu Ming felt relieved again.</p><p>The escape of the Ice Dragon patriarch meant that Xie nianqing had also escaped.</p><p>Fortunately, things didn’t develop in the worst direction. Xiangxiang Beila and the others were taken away by Ice Dragon Valley master, and Xie nianqing was taken away by Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>His master, the cloud Dragon Valley master, had only been injured. He had fallen into the hands of the other party and had been controlled.</p><p>Lu Ming was more or less at ease.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng, come with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Junior Brother, you should leave. I can’t leave. The other party has placed a restriction on my spirit God. Every once in a while, I have to report. If I don’t report within a certain period of time, the other party will activate the restriction and destroy my soul!</p><p>Zi Feng shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>this is how evil spirit uses to control people. Junior Brother, leave quickly and leave the Azure continent. With your talent, you will have the chance to become an Emperor in the future. I’ll place my hopes on you and wait for you to come back to save me!</p><p>Zi Feng said with a slight smile.</p><p>“Senior brother Zi Feng, take care!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Haha, don’t worry. I’ll definitely live well before Junior Brother returns. When Junior Brother returns, I’ll drink to my heart’s content with Junior Brother. Junior Brother, let’s go quickly. If we delay any longer, things might change!”</p><p>Zi Feng said.</p><p>don’t worry, senior brother. Lu Ming will definitely come back to save you and flatten evil spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded solemnly. Then, his figure flashed and he left the valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
