If you dare to do anything to humiliate the Golden Crow clan, you will die without a doubt!”</p><p>let’s go! an expert from the Golden Crow clan said coldly. Then, he turned into sword lights and left with the rest of the Golden Crow clan.</p><p>...</p><p>The insult he had mentioned to the Golden Crow Tribe was, of course, the incident of roasting the Golden crow’s wings that Lu Ming had mentioned earlier.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan all left and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>This battle ended just like that, but Lu Ming’s name would definitely resound throughout the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming, not seeing you for many years, you’re even stronger. As expected of the divine Ruins ‘number one!</p><p>Long Chen said with a smile as he stepped through the air.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Long Chen, then saluted the experts from Phoenix Palace, divine elephant sect, and Thunder God sect. Lu Ming Thanks everyone for your help. I’ll remember your kindness in my heart!</p><p>haha, nephew Lu Ming, you don’t have to be so polite. The WAN family and the Golden Crow Tribe are too despicable. We just can’t stand by and watch!</p><p>An old man from the Thunder God sect laughed. He was quite heroic.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go for a drink!”</p><p>Ye Dongfang walked over.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go together. It’s my treat today!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and smiled.</p><p>you young people should have a gathering. We old men won’t join in!</p><p>The elder of the Thunder God sect smiled. Then, his figure flickered and he left with the rest of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>“You guys can go back first!”</p><p>Long Chen ordered the experts of the divine elephant sect. It was obvious that Long Chen’s status in the sect was not low.</p><p>The cultivators of the divine elephant sect nodded and left as well. Finally, the cultivators of the Phoenix Palace also left.</p><p>……</p><p>In a bustling gathering place, in a bustling restaurant.</p><p>Lu Ming, Long Chen, Feng Ling, mu Qingxue, ye Dongfang, and Xu Ran sat around a table.</p><p>The table was already filled with spirit wine and delicacies. Everyone exchanged toasts and ate to their hearts ‘content.</p><p>Lu Ming, it’s been seven to eight years since we last met in the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>Long Chen drank a few cups in a row and sighed.</p><p>It had been many years since they had parted. He had originally chosen to join Dragon God Valley like Lu Ming, but he was later captured by the southern deity Palace of the divine Ruins continent and imprisoned for nearly two years. In the end, he was rescued by a peerless expert of the divine elephant sect and acknowledged him as his master. Now, he had a respected status in the divine elephant sect.</p><p>Actually, it’s not like we haven’t seen each other for seven or eight years. Later, I returned to the divine Ruins and saw you being taken away by the divine elephant sect’s powerhouses!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“You were there too?”</p><p>Long Chen was stunned.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and briefly explained how he had snuck into the South God Palace to save Long Chen.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Long Chen raised his cup, his eyes filled with gratitude.</p><p>haha, you don’t have to thank me. It’s a good thing that strong cultivators from the divine elephant sect appeared back then. Otherwise, with my cultivation at that time, I wouldn’t have been able to save you!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The others were surprised as well. They did not expect Lu Ming and Long Chen to come from the same place.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. Then, there was a flash between his eyebrows and the bubble appeared on his shoulder.</p><p>damn Lu Ming, stinky Lu Ming. You’ve trapped me in the mountain and river diagram every day while you’re here eating and drinking. Chirp chirp!</p><p>As the bubbles came out, she mumbled unhappily and pouted. Then, she grabbed a wine pot and gulped down a few mouthfuls. Her pink little face immediately turned redder.</p><p>Long Chen, Huang Ling, and the rest were dumbfounded when they saw Lu Ming release a two to three-year-old girl.</p><p>Lu Ming, it’s been so many years. I didn’t expect you to have a child. Congratulations!</p><p>Long Chen picked up a cup of wine and downed it in one go.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it turns out that you … You already have a child!”</p><p>Huang Ling widened her eyes and looked at Lu Ming, then at bubbles. The more she looked at the two of them, the more she felt that they looked alike. A hint of disappointment flashed in the depths of her eyes.</p><p>wow, this time, Huang Ling is going to cry. But Lu Ming, your daughter is so cute. Come, let aunty give you a hug!</p><p>Mu Qingxue walked over and wanted to carry bubbles.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Bubbles shook her head vigorously and jumped onto Lu Ming. She wrapped her arms around Lu Ming’s neck and hung onto him tightly.</p><p>“You’ve misunderstood. She’s not my daughter!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>“Not your daughter? Don’t quibble, I think she really looks like you!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue clearly did not believe him.</p><p>To be honest, bubbles and Lu Ming were somewhat similar. That was because when bubbles transformed, she subconsciously leaned toward Lu Ming’s appearance and naturally looked similar.</p><p>she’s really not. She’s called bubble and she’s a divine beast, not a human. Try to sense her!</p><p>Lu Ming did not know whether to laugh or cry. He could only explain.</p><p>Everyone sensed it and realized that bubble wasn’t a human. It was emitting the aura of a divine beast.</p><p>Of course, after bubbles transformed, they would not be able to sense what kind of divine beast she was.</p><p>“Oh, it really is a divine beast!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue muttered to herself, while Huang Ling heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, let’s drink!”</p><p>Long Chen smiled awkwardly.</p><p>Everyone clinked their glasses and the atmosphere was warm.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve offended the Golden Crow clan and the WAN family today. You have to be careful. Although you’re being forced by our major forces today and it’s not appropriate for the elders to make a move, there are even stronger heaven’s favorites from the two major forces who will be returning from the heavenly Emperor City soon!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said.</p><p>Long Chen, Feng Ling, and mu Qingxue’s faces all froze.</p><p>that’s right. Almost all of those geniuses have cultivation bases above the eminent Saint stage. They’re very terrifying!</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression was solemn.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor City? Why are those people in heavenly Emperor City?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. This was the first time he had heard of the heavenly Emperor City.</p><p>Lu Ming, there are nine sanctuaries in Mount Yuan. Ancient Moon sanctuary is one of them, but it’s not too strong. Heaven Emperor City is also one of the nine sanctuaries, the leader of the nine sanctuaries!</p><p>Long Chen explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The heavenly Emperor City was the leader of the nine great Holy Lands.</p><p>heavenly Emperor City is vast and boundless. Legend has it that it was built by the ancient heavenly Emperor. In heavenly Emperor City, there are many powerful forces that are even more terrifying than the ancient Moon Holy Land. About a year ago, there was news from heavenly Emperor City that a great emperor appeared and wanted to set up the yuan mountain sacred Academy, gathering all the geniuses of the entire Yuan mountain to cultivate there!</p><p>all the heaven’s pride experts of the yuan mountain will enter and the great emperor will personally give a lecture. This is a true great emperor figure, and there will be more than one. When this news came out, the entire Yuan mountain was shocked. Many powerful heaven’s pride experts took the lead and rushed to heavenly Emperor City. I heard that a storm has gathered in heavenly Emperor City. In the past year, there have been constant conflicts!</p><p>Long Chen explained.</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor? A true great emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. She could tell that Long Chen’s choice of words was a little unusual.</p><p>Could it be that the people they were talking about weren’t true great emperors?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
