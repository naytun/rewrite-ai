His cultivation had reached the upper tier of the bright Saint realm, and he had a low-tier heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>What surprised Lu Ming even more was that the other party had cast a sacred art.</p><p>...</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of an Emperor-ranked power like this was truly terrifying. A peak bright Saint had already comprehended a sacred art. One must know that in the Azure continent, there were many old monsters who had been stuck at the great circle of the bright Saint stage for tens of thousands of years, but they had not been able to comprehend a sacred art.</p><p>Although this kind of genius had the same cultivation level as the remnant, he could kill the remnant in one move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Wan Tianlong’s combat sword struck the pillar of fire, causing a terrifying tremor. The red-haired youth’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Using 10% of your power to deal with me, you overestimate yourself!”</p><p>I’ll go with you, ” Wan Tianlong said coldly. Spots of light began to light up around him. There were a total of thirty-six spots, and from each spot of light, a Saint weapon flew out. However, they were all bright Saint weapons.</p><p>In addition to his great saint weapon, he now had a total of 37 Saint weapons. The Qi of the battle weapons converged into a terrifying sword Qi, slashing toward the red-haired youth.</p><p>The red-haired young man roared and used his sacred art again, blasting out a pillar of fire.</p><p>But this time, the fire pillar was directly split apart by the sword light. The sword light did not stop and continued to slash towards the red-haired youth. The red-haired youth was shocked and quickly retreated, but it was still too late. He was swept by the sword light and his body was cut in half. He turned into two Balls of Fire and quickly retreated. They merged together in the distance with difficulty and returned to human form. However, his face was pale and his aura was somewhat weak.</p><p>Although his spiritual body was a fire spiritual body, the sword just now had still injured him severely.</p><p>Wan Tianlong laughed coldly. With his Saint weapon around him, he continued to climb up the Jade stairs.</p><p>In the surroundings, no one stepped forward to fight with Wan Tianlong.</p><p>Wan Tianlong was too strong. The red-haired youth’s combat strength was already strong enough, but he still couldn’t withstand a single strike from Wan Tianlong and was severely injured.</p><p>Furthermore, no one knew how much power Wan Tianlong had used.</p><p>Since there were still eight pavilions, there was no need to fight with Wan Tianlong.</p><p>When Wan Tianlong successfully stepped onto the pavilion, the Jade staircase beneath the pavilion disappeared.</p><p>“Young master, please sit!”</p><p>On the pavilion, the Jade Lake Saint smiled and personally poured wine for Wan Tianlong, causing many to be envious.</p><p>“Holy maiden, please!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Wan Tianlong sat at the Jade table with the Jade pool’s Holy maiden and drank wine.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade Lake Saint stood up from the second Pavilion. She also raised her hand and a Jade ladder formed.</p><p>“Which young man would like to drink with this little sister?”</p><p>A melodious voice sounded.</p><p>“This Lei will drink a cup with you, miss!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the Thunder God sect laughed and moved like a flash of lightning. The next moment, he appeared on the Jade steps. Then, he looked around and said, ” “Who wants to compete with me? If not, then this cup of wine will belong to me!”</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A voice was heard as a sovereign stepped onto the Jade stairs. At the same time, a spear radiance burst out, piercing the air and stabbing towards the sovereign of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>This young man’s combat strength was definitely strong as well, not weaker than the red-haired young man from before.</p><p>“Thunder punishment hand!”</p><p>The Paragon of the Thunder God sect waved his palm. Endless lightning flashed and condensed into a huge Thunder palm print, which smashed toward the young man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance shattered and the young man was blasted off the Jade steps without any resistance. His entire body was charred black and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>He was severely injured in one move.</p><p>“What terrifying battle strength!”</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Was this a heaven’s favorite from a powerful faction in ancient Moon Holy Land? Their combat prowess was simply too strong, easily crushing the geniuses of the other Emperor-ranked powers.</p><p>the level of the spirit body is the same, but the cultivation level is stronger, and the mastery of the divine Art is deeper!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning.</p><p>He could tell that both Wan Tianlong and The Prodigy of the Thunder God sect had reached the peak of the sacred brightness stage. Although their spiritual bodies were still low-tier heavenly spiritual bodies, their abhijnas were more advanced.</p><p>With a higher cultivation base and more powerful divine abilities, he could easily crush the other chosen.</p><p>Many of the heaven’s favorites from the Emperor-ranked forces had ugly expressions. If the heaven’s favorites from ancient Moon Holy Land were all so strong, what chance did they have?</p><p>The Paragon of the Thunder God sect showed his powerful strength. No one dared to fight with him. He stepped into the pavilion easily and drank with the Jade Lake Saint.</p><p>Then, the saintess in the third Pavilion formed a Jade ladder like before.</p><p>This time, a golden light flashed and the ninth Prince of the Golden crow stepped onto the Jade stairs.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was extremely arrogant. He looked around and no one dared to fight.</p><p>The Golden Crow race was incomparably powerful to begin with. The Ninth crown prince’s aura was oppressive, and no one dared to fight him. He easily ascended the third Pavilion.</p><p>Following that, the fourth Pavilion was also stepped onto by a heaven’s favorite from a powerful ancient Moon Holy Land faction. This faction was called the purple Extreme sect.</p><p>The Paragon of the purple Extreme sect was also extremely powerful and unfathomable. He heavily injured a Paragon who went up to fight with one move and stepped into the pavilion.</p><p>Then, in the fifth Pavilion, the young man with a sword on his back from the wilderness sword sect stepped onto the Jade ladder.</p><p>I don’t believe that all the geniuses from ancient Moon Holy Land are this strong. This Pavilion is mine!</p><p>A young man shouted and rushed up the Jade ladder, trying to compete with the wilderness sword sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. Then, everyone saw a flash of sword light. Following that, the young man who had gone up to fight for the sword retreated frantically. He retreated a few thousand meters and stood in the air, motionless.</p><p>The next moment, a bloody gash appeared on the young man’s glabella. Then, his body was cut in half and fell into the lake below.</p><p>He was dead. A heaven’s spiritual body was killed just like that.</p><p>Everyone only saw a flash of sword light. It was so terrifying!</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the wilderness sword sect looked cold and emotionless. He stepped up and no one dared to fight for it. He entered the pavilion smoothly.</p><p>There were already five pavilions that had been occupied.</p><p>Then, the sixth and seventh pavilions were all occupied by the geniuses of the ancient Moon Holy Land. The geniuses of the Emperor-ranked forces outside the ancient Moon Holy Land didn’t even step into a single Pavilion.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s gazes were cast towards the last two pavilions.</p><p>There were only two left, and almost all of the geniuses from ancient Moon Holy Land had stepped onto it.</p><p>The remaining people didn’t seem that strong, like the Golden crow’s tenth Prince.</p><p>When the Jade stairs to the eighth Pavilion appeared, a few figures rushed up at the same time.</p><p>One of them was the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince was extremely domineering. His entire body was covered in the flames of the great sun. With a single swipe of his claws, the sky was filled with flames.</p><p>The cultivation of the tenth golden Crow Prince was at the great circle of sacred brightness.</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>The others weren’t weak either. They unleashed their cultivation and fought with the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>For a time, it was difficult to determine who was superior in the battle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, another five or six figures rushed up the Jade stairs, making the battle even more intense.</p><p>This was the most intense battle. Those who had stepped onto the Jade stairs before were all too strong. They completely crushed the others and couldn’t fight.</p><p>But now, there was no one who could completely suppress them, so the battle was naturally intense. Everyone wanted to fight for one of the last two pavilions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
