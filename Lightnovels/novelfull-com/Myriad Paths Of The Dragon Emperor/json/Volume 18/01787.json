How dare you disrespect the Tianyi saintess? you’re courting death! I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>...</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared.</p><p>In addition, the eyes of the fifth golden Crow Prince and the others were also very cold.</p><p>“Shut up, saintess Tian Yi didn’t even say anything and you jumped out, aren’t you embarrassed?”</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>Wan Pingyang looked at Luo Tianyi and realized that she had no reaction at all. He then looked at Lu Ming, his face flushed red.</p><p>Yes, Luo Tianyi didn’t say anything, which meant that she had admitted it. It was really embarrassing for him to jump out like this.</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming, get down here. Who Do You Think You Are? you’re a bright Saint from the Cang region. You’re not even an Emperor-ranked force. What right do you have to sit next to the Luo Tian saintess?”</p><p>Tian Ping Yang shouted.</p><p>Oh, you’re bom into a noble family and a big force. But you’re born in a big force and your cultivation is so low. You’re really a piece of trash. Aren’t you ashamed?”</p><p>Lu Ming retorted sarcastically.</p><p>“What did you just say? Lu Ming, you stubborn turtle. I want to challenge you. Do you dare to accept my challenge? I’d like to see who’s the real trash!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang bellowed, wishing he could cut Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>Today, he wanted to humiliate Lu Ming to wash away his shame.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll give you this chance?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He then looked at Luo Tianyi and said,”Saintess Tian Yi, can we make a move here?”</p><p>of course you can. Since everyone is in such a good mood, I’ll open the fighting ring and let everyone have a good fight!</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled and nodded to the other nine saintesses.</p><p>The nine saintesses accepted the order and moved to an open space. With a wave of their hands, the ground emitted a radiance, and a fighting ring appeared.</p><p>there are many battle platforms built in the Jade pool for our disciples to spar. You can go up there and fight!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said.</p><p>No one was surprised. In fact, many major forces had built such a battle platform. It was usually hidden by a formation. If there was a battle, it could be opened at any time. It was very convenient.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>“Saintess Tianyi, please pour me a cup of tea. I’ll be back to accompany you soon!” Lu Ming stood up and said.</p><p>Then, he took a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>Wan Pingyang gritted his teeth. Lu Ming was too arrogant. Did he mean that he could defeat him before the tea turned cold?</p><p>What a joke. He was a great saint.</p><p>Moreover, he was not an ordinary great saint. He was a peerless genius with powerful combat strength. Even if Lu Ming could fight an ordinary great saint, he could not be his opponent.</p><p>“You don’t need to do anything to deal with a mere Lu Ming. I’ll suppress him!”</p><p>Wan tianbing stood up and glared at Lu Ming with a sharp gaze.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave it to you!” Wan Pingyang’s eyes turned.</p><p>If Wan tianbing could defeat Lu Ming, he would be able to humiliate Lu Ming even more. Why not?</p><p>Wan tianbing took a step forward and came to the fighting ring.</p><p>last time, you were defeated even when you joined forces with someone. If it wasn’t for the old dog of the WAN family saving you, you would have already died. You still dare to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>I’ve said it before. I was careless last time. This time, I’ll kill you!</p><p>die! Wan tianbing shouted coldly. His body began to glow, and holy weapons flew out and floated around him.</p><p>Among them, there was a particularly bright spot. A combat sword flew out from it, and a terrifying sword Qi rushed into the sky.</p><p>“It’s an absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. It turned out that the other party had sealed another absolute Saint weapon, and it was even more stable than the last time. No wonder he dared to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had almost lost to his holy weapon the last time.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Qi of combat weapons gathered, and sword Qi soared into the sky. The ten thousand celestial soldiers wielded their combat swords and slashed at Lu Ming. The power was shocking, and those below the Supreme Saint realm were shocked.</p><p>The ten thousand weapons manual was indeed amazing. As long as one’s body and cultivation were strong enough, one could seal powerful holy weapons continuously.</p><p>Ordinary Supreme Saints wouldn’t dare to use this move.</p><p>But Lu Ming was not just anyone.</p><p>“I’ll be taking this absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. In the next moment, he rushed towards his opponent and slashed his palm at him like a knife.</p><p>Lu Ming attacked his opponent’s absolute holy weapon with his bare hands, but the result was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm hit the combat sword, which trembled wildly. A terrifying force surged toward Wan tianbing.</p><p>In an instant, Wan tianbing’s expression changed, and his eyes popped out in disbelief. He felt a terrifying power coming from the combat sword that seemed to be endless.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword vibrated and his palm exploded. The sword flew out of his hand while his body was thrown far away like a broken kite. He fell on the fighting ring and spat out blood. His face was as pale as paper.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming’s Saint energy rolled up and he put away the absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>Many people at the scene gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He was defeated. Ten thousand heavenly soldiers were defeated in one move. They couldn’t even withstand a single blow.</p><p>Many people still remembered that a few months ago, Lu Ming, Wan tianbing, and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow had a battle at the Phoenix Lake. In that battle, Lu Ming had defeated Wan tianbing and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow with great difficulty. He was even forced into a disadvantageous position after Wan tianbing had taken out his holy weapon.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had made Wan tianbing spit out blood and sent him flying out of the arena with one move. He had even seized his absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>In just a few months, Lu Ming’s combat strength had become so terrifying?</p><p>“Hand over the absolute Saint weapon!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang stood up and stepped onto the fighting ring. His eyes were extremely gloomy.</p><p>“What a joke! That’s my spoils of war! Do you have an absolute Saint weapon? take it out! It’ll be my spoils later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If you want my absolute Saint weapon, I’m afraid you’ll lose your life! Kill!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared. His entire body began to glow with bright light as Saint weapons flew out one after another, their battle weapon Qi soaring into the sky.</p><p>There were 150 bright Saint weapons, 12 great saint weapons, and an absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>The absolute Saint weapon was a long spear.</p><p>Wan Pingyang held the long spear in his hand, and his aura became even more terrifying.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air, aiming for Lu Ming.</p><p>Wan Pingyang was a great saint in the minor mastery realm. When he was sealed into a Saint weapon, the power he could unleash was even more terrifying. It was far beyond the power of a ten thousand celestial weapon.</p><p>His combat strength was several times stronger than Wan tianbing’s.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His body was like lightning as he charged towards Wan Pingyang. His palm was like a blade as he struck at his opponent.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with his opponent’s spear, creating a deafening boom. Both of them swayed slightly before they continued their battle.</p><p>The great saint realm was much stronger than the bright Saint realm. Moreover, the opponent’s spiritual body was also a medium-grade heaven spiritual body. His combat power was extremely terrifying, far beyond the ordinary great saint lower mastery.</p><p>…..</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Wan Pingyang had exchanged dozens of blows. The entire place was filled with intense explosions, causing the entire area to shake..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
