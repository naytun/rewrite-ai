He had just arrived at the ancient Moon Holy Land, and before this, he had not even had a single Emperor-ranked figure in the Azure continent. Naturally, he was not clear about the specific division of martial emperors.</p><p>the martial sovereign realm is actually divided into several realms. Those who have just broken through to the martial sovereign realm are known as the minor sovereign realm. Above that is the medium sovereign realm. Above the medium sovereign realm is the great sovereign realm. Above the great sovereign realm is the heavenly Sovereign realm. Each sovereign realm is further divided into seven stars!</p><p>...</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The Martial Emperor realm actually contained so many realms.</p><p>The small emperor position, the middle Emperor position, the great emperor position, and the heavenly Emperor position. Each Emperor position was further divided into seven stars.</p><p>How shocking was this?</p><p>outside of the ancient Moon Holy Land, the Emperor-ranked powerhouses of the Emperor-ranked forces are usually at the minor Emperor realm. They are not true great emperors at all. However, many people below the Martial Emperor realm would respectfully call them great emperors. In fact, only when they have truly reached the great emperor realm can they be considered true great emperors. They would add the word ‘great emperor’ behind their titles, just like the reincarnation Emperor in the hundred clan battlefield!</p><p>Huang Ling continued to explain.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. The great emperor that they usually referred to was not the great emperor. It was just a form of respect.</p><p>For example, Emperor Cang, Emperor Yun, thousand kill Martial Emperor, and the others were not great emperors. Hence, they did not have the word ‘great emperor’ in their titles.</p><p>For example, Emperor Cang was known as the great emperor in the Azure continent. Of course, it was only because the people of the Azure continent did not understand the specific division of the martial sovereigns.</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor was the true Emperor.</p><p>there are so many levels in the Martial Emperor realm. I guess people like Emperor Cang are only at the minor Emperor realm. The road to the peak is long. But this is even more interesting!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with anticipation.</p><p>The path of martial arts was long, and in the process of climbing, wasn’t it a kind of pleasure?</p><p>great emperors are the ones who stand at the peak. Right now, we don’t even know if there are any in the ancient Moon Holy Land. But in the heavenly Emperor City, a few great emperors have come forward to establish the yuan mountain sacred Academy. This has never happened before, so it naturally attracts countless geniuses and experts!</p><p>Ye Dongfang said. His eyes also revealed a look of yearning.</p><p>“Are there any heavenly Emperor-ranked powerhouses in Mount Yuan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others shook their heads.</p><p>legend has it that the heavenly Emperor City was built by the heavenly Emperor. But now, the heavenly Emperor has become a legend and can not be seen in the world. The great emperor is the peak!</p><p>Long Chen sighed.</p><p>“Then, are there any realms above the heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>there are legends, but that’s too far away. It’s a legend among legends!</p><p>Huang Ling said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Lu Ming could not calm down. He thought of many things.</p><p>Which realm were the top ten warbeasts in?</p><p>Eggy once said that the top ten war beasts were the peak existences of the world. Was it the Emperor or the heavenly Emperor?</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had seen the Titan longhorn beetle in action. It was truly terrifying and could destroy the world.</p><p>Also, it was said that the chaos Thearch was even stronger than the top ten warbeasts. What realm was he at?</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming shook his head and pulled himself back from his thoughts. All these were still too far away from him.</p><p>“Has the yuan mountain sacred Academy already started its meeting?”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic.</p><p>no, I heard that it has been completed. I believe that it will be held soon. This time, those heaven’s pride experts have returned from the heavenly Emperor City to prepare for the yuan mountain sacred Academy. After all, it’s not easy to enter the yuan mountain sacred Academy!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>Everyone chatted and drank. Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, a few hours had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming found out a lot of information that he did not know in the past.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had obtained a part of the nine Dragons ‘memory, it was only a part after all. Many parts were missing. Moreover, the nine Dragons had fallen a long time ago. Their memory of the yuan continent was almost blank.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have something to ask you. How about we go outside and talk?”</p><p>Said Long Chen.</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“We should also go!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>After that, Huang Ling, ye Dongfang, Xu Ran, and the others all left.</p><p>Lu Ming paid the bill and left with Long Chen.</p><p>It was already night time, and the two of them walked in the air, above the clouds.</p><p>What is the situation in the divine wilderness? ”</p><p>Long Chen asked.</p><p>Lu Ming was not surprised. He knew that Long Chen would definitely ask.</p><p>the divine wilderness has been unified …</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained what had happened in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Long Chen fell silent for a long time after hearing this.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything.</p><p>After all, Long Chen had once been from an Overlord force that had been destroyed by him. The Xie family had even shut themselves in for ten thousand years.</p><p>Long Chen’s fiancée was the princess of the Xie family, Xie nianlin.</p><p>After a long time, Long Chen sighed and said, ” who would have thought that such a thing would happen in the divine wilderness? but this is good too. Actually, when I saw you, I knew that the situation in the divine wilderness had most likely stabilized!</p><p>“You don’t blame me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“What’s so strange about the current situation? In this world, many stories happen every day, and many forces are destroyed and many forces are born. These are the constant rules of this world, and if I were you, I would do the same!”</p><p>Long Chen said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for letting go of the Xie family!”</p><p>Long Chen smiled. He thought for a moment and said, ” it looks like I’ll have to return to the divine wilderness at some point in time. I want to bring nianlin out. That doesn’t count as breaking my oath, right? ”</p><p>of course not. When are you going back? does the divine elephant sect have a teleportation array? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He had been away for many years. Lu Ming wanted to make a trip back.</p><p>the divine elephant sect doesn’t have a teleportation array to the continent cluster of the divine Ruins. To the ancient Moon Holy Land, the continent cluster of the divine Ruins is too remote, and no force will open such a teleportation array. As far as I know, only some forces in the Azure state, as well as forces like the cloud state and the Imperial state, who are closer to the continent cluster of the divine Ruins, have such a teleportation array!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“What? Only the Cang, Yun and di continents have teleportation arrays?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>“That’s right. Why? Could it be that something big has happened in these three states?”</p><p>Long Chen asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming then told him about the evil spirit cult.</p><p>it’s actually the evil spirit cult. I’ll go back and report this to master. I’ll see if master can send people to the Azure continent to exterminate the evil spirit cult!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It would be for the best if the divine elephant sect’s experts annihilated evil spirit cult.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we haven’t seen each other for many years. Why don’t we have a friendly match?”</p><p>let’s go! Long Chen suddenly said. A powerful fighting spirit emanated from his body.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, and a powerful fighting spirit emanated from him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
