Ming ‘er, you’re really lucky!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes lit up as a smile appeared on his face. However, his expression soon turned serious. “Ming ‘er, who else knows about this matter? why was it leaked?”</p><p>...</p><p>there’s only one person. That’s Dharma King annihilating soul from evil spirit. Back then, he was fighting against Emperor Cang …</p><p>Lu Ming briefly recounted his encounter with Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul and evil spirit are so ruthless. They’re trying to start a civil war in the Azure continent!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master frowned.</p><p>The other party had spread the news that Lu Ming had obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and storage ring. However, the truth was that Lu Ming did not obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance at all. In this case, even if Lu Ming handed over Emperor Cang’s storage ring, it would be useless. If he did not hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance, it would definitely cause an internal conflict in the Azure continent.</p><p>This was evil Spirit’s scheme.</p><p>Ming ‘er, Emperor Cang’s storage ring is an opportunity for you. You should keep it well. Even if others want to take it, they can’t!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>At this moment, there was a commotion outside the cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come out!”</p><p>A voice came from afar.</p><p>“It’s that old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Upon hearing the voice, Lu Ming knew that it was the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>hehe, this old man has come so quickly. I’d like to see what he’s doing here.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said coldly. Then, his voice was transmitted out, ” “Let them in!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley’s disciples let them in. Then, they saw the valley master of Silver Dragon leading a group of people, Walking in the Air with an overbearing aura.</p><p>“Yin Zheng, why did you bring your men to my Cloud Dragon Valley in such an aggressive manner?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Of course, it’s for Lu Ming!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley looked at Lu Ming and sneered.”Lu Ming, you’re really selfish. You’ve obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, but you didn’t say a word and kept them for your own enjoyment. Don’t forget who brought you from a desolate Island back then. If it weren’t for that desolate Island, would you be where you are today?”</p><p>however, you obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures and wanted to enjoy them all for yourself. Now, hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. You should share them!</p><p>The master of the valley of Silver Dragon looked at Lu Ming with a burning gaze, filled with greed.</p><p>The people who had come with the master of Silver Dragon Valley also looked excited.</p><p>“Hehe, what a joke!”</p><p>The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley said coldly, ” I can tell you that Lu Ming did not obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. Also, I can tell you that even if Lu Ming did obtain them, it was his own opportunity. No one can take it away!</p><p>“Yun ruoxu, stop quibbling. Who would believe that Lu Ming did not obtain Emperor Cang’s legacy and treasures? Without Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, how could he, a person from the desolate Island, have his current achievements?”</p><p>“Furthermore, he took out a few dozen Saint weapons at the treasure sealing Convention, and he still said that he didn’t obtain Emperor Cang’s treasure? Yun ruoxu, you want to keep it and share it with Lu Ming, don’t you? besides, he only obtained it because of the sect’s power. Therefore, he must hand it over!”</p><p>Said the master of Silver Dragon Valley. His eyes flickered with a cold light.</p><p>“Hehe, if others have to hand over their opportunities, then why don’t you hand over your opportunities, Yin Zheng? Don’t say that you didn’t get any opportunities. If you didn’t have any opportunities, how could you have cultivated to such a realm?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice was cold and indifferent.</p><p>Any martial artist who had some achievements would more or less have some opportunities.</p><p>For a top expert to be born, one’s own talent, hard work, and willpower were indispensable. However, one couldn’t lack opportunities either.</p><p>Hmph, how can the opportunities that I have obtained be compared to Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures? today, Lu Ming must hand it over!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said arrogantly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the cloud Dragon Valley master stepped forward, his body erupting with a terrifying aura that pressed down on the silver Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Yun ruoxu, what are you doing? This is the Dragon God Valley. I came here with reason, and you still want to attack me. The Dragon God Valley does not belong to you alone!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! the master of Silver Dragon Valley shouted.</p><p>However, what welcomed him was a terrifying sword radiance.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” break! the master of Silver Dragon Valley bellowed, his body suffused with dazzling silver light as he used all his strength to resist.</p><p>But as the sword light flashed, the silver light on his body collapsed, and his face was covered in blood.</p><p>One of his ears had been cut off by the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, the next sword will cut off your head!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said coldly.</p><p>“Yun ruoxu, you … Wait here, I’ll report this to the valley master!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was furious. His eyes were filled with fear. In the end, he didn’t dare to stay and left dejectedly.</p><p>“A clown!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said indifferently. He then looked at Lu Ming.”Ming ‘er, focus on your cultivation. Don’t think too much. With master here, no one can touch you!”</p><p>Lu Ming was touched. He bowed respectfully and said, ” “Many thanks, master!”</p><p>there’s no need to thank me. I’m your master, so it’s my duty to protect you. I’ll take my leave first!</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley smiled and then stepped into the air, leaving the place.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to sit cross-legged on the peak of the snow Mountain, cultivating quietly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>On this day, a Dragon’s Roar resounded in Dragon God Valley. Lu Ming woke up from his cultivation and looked in the direction of the entrance of Dragon God Valley. There, the shadow of a real Dragon soared into the sky, and then a light curtain was formed.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>A voice spread throughout the entire Dragon God Valley, Breaking the Silence.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley, countless figures rose into the air and gathered at the entrance of the valley.</p><p>“They’re really fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of light, the cloud Dragon Valley master appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“It seems that a sect has come. Ming ‘er, let’s go and take a look together!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and headed towards the entrance of Dragon God Valley with the cloud Dragon Valley master. When they arrived, countless disciples, deacons, and elders of Dragon God Valley looked at Lu Ming with strange expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored everyone’s gazes and looked ahead.</p><p>At this time, a light curtain filled the entrance of Dragon God Valley. It was the protective array of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Outside Dragon God Valley, there were several huge warships. Then, figures flew out of the warships. There were at least tens of thousands of people.</p><p>All of them had powerful auras and were experts.</p><p>There were two main groups of people. One was dressed in white robes, while the other was dressed in black robes.</p><p>The heavenly God sect, the heavenly universe demon sect.</p><p>At the forefront of the Tian Yu demon sect was the sect master.</p><p>the sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect are here. What a big formation!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said coldly.</p><p>On the side of the tianshen sect, a middle-aged man was bathed in holy light. Like a god, he was full of dignity and had a strong aura. He stepped forward, standing side by side with the sect master of the Tianyu demon sect, and arrived outside Dragon God Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
