The chaotic laws circulated and formed a huge chaotic hand that grabbed at Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>The terrifying pressure made people’s expressions change.</p><p>...</p><p>Without a doubt, the chaotic body was at the absolute Saint level, and it was the chaotic body. Just how terrifying was its battle prowess? It was hard to imagine.</p><p>He was undefeatable!</p><p>At this moment, such a sentence appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>If he tried to block it head-on, only death would await him.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. The four of them retreated frantically to avoid the power of the palm.</p><p>“Can you escape?”</p><p>The chaotic body said coldly. With a flash, he appeared behind Lu Ming and threw a punch. It was as fast as lightning, so fast that Lu Ming could not block it.</p><p>The difference in their cultivation levels was too great.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Huang Ling exclaimed.</p><p>Long Chen and bubbles were also extremely anxious. However, the difference in their cultivation base was too great. Even if they wanted to help, it would be of no use.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist of the chaotic body pierced through Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was completely fine.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a shadow. The chaotic body’s fist seemed to have struck the air.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The chaotic body roared and threw another punch. However, it still hit the air. Lu Ming’s body seemed to be a Phantom.</p><p>“In this place, you can not fight each other!”</p><p>The white-robed old man in the sky said.</p><p>So that was how it was!</p><p>Many people’s hearts skipped a beat. They couldn’t make a move here, as they couldn’t attack each other at all.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen heaved a long sigh of relief. Just now, they really thought that Lu Ming was going to be killed by the other party.</p><p>The chaotic body retreated with a cold and ugly expression.</p><p>“You’re lucky, but you’ll die in my hands sooner or later!”</p><p>The chaotic body coldly said.</p><p>“You’re just relying on your higher cultivation. In the future, I’ll definitely kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Between him and the chaotic body, only one of them could live. If they met in the future, there would definitely be a bitter battle without any room for negotiation.</p><p>“You? He’s just a fake son of chaos. He’ll never be my match in his entire life!”</p><p>The chaotic body spoke with great pride.</p><p>He had the right to be proud. He had the chaotic body and was the true son of chaos. He was blessed by the heavens and had a strong fate. As long as he cultivated to the half-Saint realm, he would naturally be able to master the chaotic laws.</p><p>What was Lu Ming?</p><p>He had only become a monk halfway through his life and did not possess the chaotic body. Even if he could control the Laws of Chaos, how could he compare to him?</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything else. There was no point in saying anything now. In the future, Lu Ming would use his actions to tell the world who the real son of chaos was.</p><p>As they continued to wait, more and more people arrived. Not long after, there were more than two thousand people near the abyss.</p><p>There had been more than three thousand people before, but now there were more than two thousand left.</p><p>Some were killed, while others were sent back.</p><p>At this time, the white-robed old man waved his hand, and a row of stone platforms appeared on the edge of the abyss, floating in the air.</p><p>There were more than 2000 of them, almost the same number as them, and they were all lined up in a row.</p><p>the method to cross the abyss is very simple. Each of you will choose a stone platform and sit on it. Then, I will give you a lecture. You will comprehend, and as you comprehend, the stone platform will float forward. The faster you comprehend, the faster the stone platform will float forward!</p><p>in the end, only the top 100 can continue with the next test. As for the others, I will send you back.</p><p>The white-robed old man explained the rules.</p><p>“What? Only the top 100 can continue!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>This ratio was really too low.</p><p>One had to know that those who could come here were all geniuses among geniuses. They were not ordinary cultivators. It was easier said than done to stand out among these people.</p><p>Everyone also understood that this test was not about combat power, but comprehension.</p><p>After all, the geniuses here were all different in age, background, and cultivation. There was no point in competing in battle prowess. It was a competition of potential.</p><p>Perception was a part of one’s potential.</p><p>“I’ll definitely have a share in the top 100!”</p><p>I will definitely enter the top 100!</p><p>Some of the young men were very confident that they would be able to enter the top 100.</p><p>alright, you can go up and pick any stone platform you like. Every stone platform is the same!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, someone flew up and landed on a stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three also stepped forward. They each chose a stone platform and sat cross-legged.</p><p>The stone platform was very small, and could only accommodate one person. Looking out of the stone platform, there was a dark abyss below, and no one knew how deep it was.</p><p>Very quickly, the two thousand people had all landed on the stone platform.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll start my lecture now!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said. The next moment, his body bloomed with brilliant light, and divine rings surrounded him.</p><p>Then, the white-robed old man opened his mouth and said each word. Each word was extremely profound and turned into the sound of the great Dao, entering everyone’s ears.</p><p>Hearing this sound, Lu Ming’s heart and soul seemed to calm down. He fell into an ethereal state and the sound of the great Dao kept coming into his ears.</p><p>The white-robed old man was not talking about any Dao or law. He was talking about the truth of heaven and earth, the truth of martial arts, and the truth of the heavenly Dao.</p><p>This kind of truth could conform to any law, and it depended purely on one’s comprehension ability.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s mind, he seemed to have seen the experience of a peerless powerhouse. From the fragile youth, he conquered step by step, and finally rose to the top of the world, becoming a top powerhouse.</p><p>In his mind, the apparition of the chaos Thearch became even more mysterious. The Laws of Chaos circulated and Lu Ming’s understanding became clearer and clearer.</p><p>In his elixir field, the two Saint hearts were beating like real hearts. Vigorous Saint power gushed out of the Saint hearts and poured into the meridians of his body.</p><p>Lu Ming had completely forgotten about everything in the outside world. He had forgotten his purpose for coming and the time. He only had one goal, which was to cultivate and comprehend.</p><p>As the crowd comprehended, the stone platforms began to fly forward.</p><p>For the first three days, everyone rode side by side, and there was not much difference between them.</p><p>However, from the third day onwards, the gap began to show.</p><p>Some people started to fall behind, while others were getting faster and faster, surpassing the others.</p><p>As time passed, the gap between them grew bigger and bigger.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, bubbles, Feng Ling, and Long Chen were still in the top hundred.</p><p>Bubbles was a true space-time spirit mouse. There was no need to mention her comprehension ability. If she were to fully mature, she would be at the peak of the world and not many people would be able to match her.</p><p>As for Huang Ling and Long Chen, they had both awakened the bloodlines of the top ten war beasts. Needless to say, their comprehension abilities were also extremely terrifying.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, there was no need to mention him.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s speed became faster and faster. He slowly surpassed Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the others as he moved forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
