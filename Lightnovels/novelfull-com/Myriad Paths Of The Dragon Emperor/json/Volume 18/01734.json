For those with low cultivation, she was extremely fast. With a wave of her hand, she set up restrictions on them one by one.</p><p>...</p><p>The person with the restriction stood behind the skinny old woman obediently.</p><p>“Master, I’m going to rush out!”</p><p>In the crowd, Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand tightly and sent a message to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>He wasn’t willing to be controlled by evil spirit and become their puppet. That would be worse than death. Moreover, there was still Xie nianqing.</p><p>He would rather die than let Xie nianqing fall into evil Spirit’s hands again.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>To his surprise, the cloud Dragon Valley master nodded and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. I’ll contact the others and we’ll take action together. No matter what, you young people must be sent out. Otherwise, we really have no hope!</p><p>Lu Ming was touched. It seemed that the cloud Dragon Valley master had no intention of surrendering. Even if Lu Ming did not say anything, the cloud Dragon Valley master would find a way to rush out.</p><p>master, the halberd I obtained from the hundred clan battlefield only has two streams of energy. I used one last time at the Tianyu demon sect, and if I use the other one, I can kill a person in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm with one strike!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes lit up. Originally, he didn’t have much confidence because each of the four sides had an absolute Saint in the Great Perfection realm guarding them. In addition, there were two evil spirit elders. Even if he could unite a group of people and attack together, he wouldn’t have much of a chance.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming could kill an absolute Saint in the perfection stage, they would be able to break out of the encirclement from that direction. The possibility of them breaking out would increase greatly.</p><p>“I’ll contact the others first!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said. He immediately sent a voice transmission to the Ice Dragon patriarch, who naturally agreed.</p><p>Then, the cloud Dragon Valley master sent a message to the sect master of the life and death Sword sect, the castle Master of the demon Castle, and the hall Master of the heaven seat Hall.</p><p>Most people agreed, but people like the evil moon sect and poyuan family shook their heads and sighed. They didn’t dare to take the risk.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, we’ve already discussed it. When the time comes, the patriarch and I will take you and nianqing to break out of the encirclement!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s just me and Xiao Qing. What about my senior brothers and the other disciples of Dragon God Valley? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>there’s no other way. The more people we bring, the less chance we’ll be able to escape. If we bring them along, we’ll only kill them. I’ll make them surrender and join evil spirit first. You and nianqing are the most talented. Only if you rush out will there be hope. When your cultivation is great, you can come back to save them. If you’re caught, the others will have even less hope!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>Lu Ming could not bear it.</p><p>“There’s no need to say anything else. Ming ‘er, remember, you are the only hope. The other sect leaders think the same way. They will only bring one or two of their most outstanding disciples to break out of the encirclement. There is only hope if you are safe!”</p><p>Said the cloud Dragon Valley master. Then, he sent a voice transmission to yang tianzong and the others.</p><p>Yang tianzong and the rest trembled before they nodded without hesitation.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, I’m counting on you. I’ll wait for you to save me in the future!”</p><p>Yang tianzong smiled and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. He then strode out and said loudly,”I want to surrender!”</p><p>“I also want to surrender!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s other senior brothers, as well as the rest of the people from Dragon God Valley, stepped out one after another, shouting their surrender.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and felt a tingling sensation at the tip of his nose.</p><p>Some people might be really afraid of death and thus surrendered. However, Lu Ming understood yang tianzong and the rest very well. They would definitely rather fight to the death than surrender. However, at this moment, they surrendered without any hesitation.</p><p>Their purpose was to put Lu Ming and the rest at ease, and to paralyze the evil spirit cult and the DI family.</p><p>senior brother, if I rush out, I will definitely come back to save you. Evil spirit cult, di family, I will definitely make them disappear from the yuan continent!</p><p>Lu Ming swore in his heart.</p><p>“I surrender!”</p><p>There were people from other sects who kept shouting to surrender.</p><p>As expected, the evil spirit cultivators looked satisfied. The skinny old woman waved her hand and set up a restriction for yang tianzong and the rest.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, it’s time!”</p><p>The voice of the cloud Dragon Valley master rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and dashed to the West.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing, the cloud Dragon Valley master, the Ice Dragon patriarch, the life-and-death Sword sect master, and the others also moved. They all rushed to the West.</p><p>“You still want to resist? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>From the West, an absolute Saint in the perfection stage shouted. A golden combat sword appeared in his hand, and a terrifying aura burst forth. A terrifying golden sword light slashed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The attack of an absolute Saint in the great circle was too terrifying. It suppressed all directions and destroyed everything in its way.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others ‘expressions changed. Even if they joined forces, they might not be able to break out of this attack. If they were blocked by the other party, the others would react and they would have no chance.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming bellowed. The reincarnation halberd appeared and the last wave of energy inside it exploded without hesitation.</p><p>The reincarnation halberd transformed into a towering halberd. As it slashed down, the golden sword light was directly destroyed by the halberd. The halberd didn’t stop, it was as fast as lightning.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The absolute Saint in the great circle couldn’t block it at all and was cut in half by the halberd. The terrifying power even left a deep trench in the ground.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>“Kill our way out!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others were invigorated as they charged forward with all their might.</p><p>There were still a few absolute Saints in front of them, but they were pushed back. They didn’t want to fight anymore. They rushed out of the crowd and flew away.</p><p>“Damn it, chase, quickly chase!”</p><p>The white-haired elder from evil spirit roared and was the first to give chase.</p><p>The other two absolute Saints from the DI family, as well as some other absolute Saints, also rushed out and flew toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“You guys, go after them too!”</p><p>The skinny old woman looked at the sect master and the others.</p><p>The face of the sect master of the heavenly God sect changed.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>The skinny old woman shouted. The sect master of the deity sect and the few absolute Saints who were trapped by the restriction had no choice but to chase after Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master enveloped Lu Ming with his Saint energy while the Ice Dragon patriarch flew forward at top speed with Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the room and realized that the others had brought one person each.</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect brought a young man with him. Lu Ming was quite familiar with him. It was Luo Xiang.</p><p>Another absolute Saint of the life-and-death Sword sect also brought a young man.</p><p>In addition, there were two absolute Saints from Demon Castle, two absolute Saints from the sky King Palace, and two absolute Saints from the Linglong Palace, each with one person.</p><p>There were ten absolute Saints and ten young men.</p><p>Without a doubt, these young men were the most talented ones in their respective sects. Only by sending them out would they have hope in the future.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape, so surrender!”</p><p>A cold voice came from behind.</p><p>It was the elder from evil spirit, the white-haired old man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
