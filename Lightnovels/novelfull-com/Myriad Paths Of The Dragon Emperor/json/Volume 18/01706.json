It was difficult to cross and required a strong accumulation.</p><p>There were many people in the world who had reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm and were affected by the laws. However, how many could break through to the Saint realm?</p><p>...</p><p>The lifespan of a Saint was extremely long. The reason why there were so many saints in the thirteen top sects of the Azure continent was because of the accumulation of time.</p><p>Some people stayed in the half-Saint realm for decades, centuries, or even millennia. For example, the Son of God had stayed in the half-Saint realm for more than ten years before he entered the Saint realm.</p><p>As for the other top ten geniuses of the Azure continent, many of them had also stopped at the half-Saint level for a long time.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming cultivated the Laws of Chaos and it was harder for him to make a breakthrough than ordinary people. It was normal for him to not make a breakthrough in a year.</p><p>Apart from Lu Ming, the inscription secondary body had also reached the third stage of the half-Saint realm and was already in the zone of the laws.</p><p>As for bubbles, she had reached the law tank stage not long after the treasure fixing assembly. During this period of time, she had been cultivating in seclusion in an attempt to break through to the sage realm.</p><p>Of course, bubble’s ‘hard work’ was just sleeping and refining the time and space spinel every day.</p><p>Xiangxiang, you should go back first. Consolidate your realm and build a solid foundation. Don’t be in a hurry to break through!</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>The little girl nodded, then stepped into the air and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming was still sitting cross-legged on the peak of the snow Mountain, not moving at all. He let the wind and snow approach him, but he seemed to be detached from the world.</p><p>His mind was wandering in the natural world, as if he had become one with the world.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, a screech that resounded through the sky woke Lu Ming up.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and looked at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, a huge Goshawk was flying.</p><p>No, it was not a real Goshawk, but a building, a huge and magnificent building.</p><p>Emperor Cang’s bedroom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank. He could tell at a glance that this was the secret chamber of the hidden ground that he had seen in Emperor Cang’s Secret realm.</p><p>Back then, Emperor Cang used his Sacred Treasure, the Thunder cauldron, to fight with Shakyamuni annihilating soul. Emperor Cang’s bedroom broke through the void and left, flying into the endless void. Now, after a few years, it actually reappeared.</p><p>Emperor Cang’s chamber flew towards the West of the Azure continent at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh …</p><p>At this moment, seven to eight figures flew out from Dragon God Valley. Each of them was extremely fast as they chased after Emperor Cang’s bedchamber. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared.</p><p>The speed was too fast. Even if Lu Ming were to give chase, he would definitely not be able to catch up.</p><p>“Emperor Cang’s chamber has reappeared?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in turmoil.</p><p>Emperor Cang’s storage ring was still in his hands. It was a pity that there was Emperor Cang’s imprint on it and he was unable to open it now.</p><p>“I wonder how Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul are doing? The appearance of Emperor Cang’s chamber will definitely shock the entire Azure continent. I believe that news will spread soon!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and ended his cultivation. He returned to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>As expected, after ten days, a piece of news spread throughout the Azure continent.</p><p>Emperor Cang’s chamber appeared. It flew from east to west and finally landed on a desert in the West. All the large sects in the Azure continent were alarmed and sent their top experts over.</p><p>In the end, the various sects sent out their top experts to enter Emperor Cang’s bedroom. In the end, they actually found Emperor Cang’s corpse.</p><p>This was a demon Thearch’s corpse, which was extremely precious. Every feather was a top-tier material that could be refined into a terrifying holy weapon.</p><p>Its flesh, blood, bones, and bones were even more precious than many natural treasures. They could be refined into Supreme medicines with endless mysteries.</p><p>It could be said that a demon Thearch’s entire body was filled with treasures.</p><p>In the end, the various large sects launched an intense fight over it, and a great battle broke out.</p><p>In the end, the 12 top sects decided to split the demon Thearch’s corpse into 12 portions. Each sect would get one portion.</p><p>The demon Emperor of a generation, the peerless expert who suppressed the Azure continent, Emperor Cang, was divided up by the various sects after his death.</p><p>However, on Emperor Cang’s body, the various sects could not find the two most precious treasures. They were Emperor Cang’s world core and storage ring.</p><p>Once a cultivator reached the Martial Emperor realm, he could transform his Saint heart into a world, a real world.</p><p>Legend had it that some peerless mighty figures could evolve their own worlds into the same as the outside world. They could reproduce living creatures on their own and were extremely mysterious.</p><p>The worlds that Emperor-level experts evolved were collectively called small worlds.</p><p>The core of a small world was the world core. It was extremely precious and contained the martial sovereign’s inheritance.</p><p>But now, Emperor Cang’s realm core and storage ring were nowhere to be seen, leading to all sorts of speculations.</p><p>Another half a month passed, and an even more shocking piece of news caused an uproar in the Azure region.</p><p>The news said that Emperor Cang’s inheritance and storage ring had long been obtained by others.</p><p>Back then, when the younger generation entered the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm, someone had obtained Emperor Cang’s legacy and storage ring. That person was Lu Ming.</p><p>Once this news was released, the world was shaken and Lu Ming was once again pushed into the eye of the storm.</p><p>As for the fact that Lu Ming was the only one who entered the core of Emperor Cang’s bedroom, it was dug up again.</p><p>Following that, there was news that Lu Ming was able to rise so quickly and his combat strength was so shocking because he had obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures.</p><p>This series of news made most people believe that Lu Ming had definitely obtained Emperor Cang’s legacy and storage ring.</p><p>All the major sects in the Cang region turned their attention to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be moved by Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures?</p><p>Lu Ming, a person from a small island overseas, was able to defy the heavens and rise to power just because he had obtained Emperor Cang’s legacy and treasures. If he was not a Saint, he could kill a Saint. If he had reached such a level, what about others who had obtained it?</p><p>In the Azure continent, a terrifying storm was brewing.</p><p>A storm is coming!</p><p>At the top of a Snow Mountain in Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming stood still, frowning.</p><p>Who was it that revealed that he had obtained Emperor Cang’s storage ring?</p><p>“Could it be Shakyamuni annihilating soul? Dharma King annihilating soul didn’t die?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Previously, when the experts entered Emperor Cang’s bedroom, they only found Emperor Cang’s corpse and not Shakyamuni annihilating soul’s corpse. It was very likely that Shakyamuni annihilating soul was not dead.</p><p>In the entire world, only Shakyamuni annihilating soul had seen Lu Ming obtain Emperor Cang’s storage ring.</p><p>Perhaps, it was Shakyamuni annihilating soul who had taken away Emperor Cang’s world core and spread the news.</p><p>At this moment, a figure stepped through the air and landed beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and cupped his fists.</p><p>This person was the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, you should have heard the news from the outside world, right?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“I’ve heard of it!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master pondered for a moment before saying, ” “Ming ‘er, did you obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures?”</p><p>he only obtained Emperor Cang’s storage ring and not the inheritance!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hide anything and spoke frankly.</p><p>Even if he wanted to hide it now, he couldn’t.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
