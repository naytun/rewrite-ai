Suddenly, they saw an extremely huge spiritual mouse in front of them.</p><p>“It’s the space-time spirit mouse!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He could tell at one glance that this huge spirit mouse was the space-time spirit mouse.</p><p>The space-time spirit rat’s figure also appeared here, which meant that the true bodies of these phantoms might not necessarily be alive. Many of them might have already died.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles rolled to her feet and looked at the huge space-time spirit rat Phantom in a daze, her eyes filled with sorrow.</p><p>All of a sudden, the shadow of the space-time spirit rat began to shrink rapidly. In the end, it turned into a ray of light and rushed toward Lu Ming at an unimaginable speed. Before Lu Ming could react, the ray of light had rushed into the space between bubbles ‘eyebrows and disappeared.</p><p>Bubbles ‘expression turned serious as she sat cross-legged on the boat and started cultivating. A mystical aura emanated from her body as space-time laws revolved around her.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He knew that this was bubbles’s opportunity.</p><p>After that, the three of them continued forward.</p><p>After another two days, they saw an extremely huge statue in the sky. It was howling at the sky, and its might suppressed the entire universe.</p><p>It was one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the Archean dragonesque elephant!</p><p>Long Chen looked at the Archean dragonesque elephant with all his attention. In the end, just like the space-time spirit mouse, the Archean dragonesque elephant’s shadow also shrank rapidly. In the end, it turned into a ray of light and disappeared into Long Chen’s forehead.</p><p>Long Chen closed his eyes to comprehend. He split a part of his mind to control the boat and moved forward with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>There seemed to be many projections of powerful existences in this vast and endless land.</p><p>Not long after, they encountered a giant Phoenix, its entire body suffused with Immortal Flames. This was one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the undying celestial Phoenix.</p><p>The shadow of the undying celestial Phoenix also turned into a ray of light and rushed into Huang Ling’s forehead.</p><p>Bubbles, Long Chen, and Feng Ling had all received their opportunities one after another.</p><p>Lu Ming was also looking forward to it. What would he encounter? Would he encounter the nine Dragons ‘shadow?</p><p>Another two days passed, and they had been here for more than twenty days.</p><p>In front of him, a huge figure sat cross-legged in the void, surrounded by the aura of chaos.</p><p>“This is … Primal Chaos Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>The primal Chaos Emperor was also one of the nine Hall Masters of the Hunyuan sect.</p><p>The chaos Thearch’s body exuded a powerful and terrifying chaos law fluctuation. Lu Ming stared at the chaos Thearch’s apparition. The chaos law on his body also burst forth, seemingly resonating with the chaos Thearch’s apparition.</p><p>As expected, the figure of the chaos Thearch quickly shrank and turned into a ray of light, rushing into Lu Ming’s forehead.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately closed his eyes. In his mind, an apparition of the chaos Thearch appeared, exuding a powerful chaos law aura.</p><p>“A great opportunity!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. If he used this shadow as a reference from time to time, the speed at which he comprehended the Laws of Chaos would definitely increase greatly.</p><p>He hadn’t expected to get such an opportunity after being brought here by the primordial chaos token.</p><p>Lu Ming diverted a small part of his attention to control the boat and continued to sail forward. Then, he quietly studied the chaotic finger of calamity.</p><p>As expected, with the primal Chaos Thearch’s image in his mind as a reference, his speed of comprehending the primal Chaos tribulation finger was greatly accelerated.</p><p>Seven days later, Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation had reached forty percent completion.</p><p>At this time, they had already been here for a month.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In front of him, a violent roar came.</p><p>Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and Long Chen woke up from their cultivation.</p><p>This was the first time they had heard such a loud noise since they entered this place.</p><p>The three of them looked forward. In front of them, there were flashes of lightning that covered the entire space.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Suddenly, the three of them looked to the side.</p><p>They finally saw the others. They were all young people, both men and women. Each of them had an extraordinary aura. One look and one could tell that they were Dragons among men.</p><p>These people, like Lu Ming and the rest, were each on a small boat and sailed forward.</p><p>A few people’s gazes were as cold as a knife as they swept across Lu Ming and the other two. However, they only swept their eyes past them before they looked ahead.</p><p>“What a strong cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Although he had only glanced at the few people just now, they had given off a strong pressure. Their cultivation was definitely not as simple as that of a bright Saint. They had probably surpassed a bright Saint and reached an even higher realm.</p><p>They continued to sail forward, and the deafening sound in front of them became stronger and stronger. It was the sound of thunder.</p><p>Endless lightning flashed in the void, blocking the way forward.</p><p>“The test is finally here. However, how can mere lightning stop me?”</p><p>A proud figure appeared. Lu Ming saw a young man with sharp eyes and a beak like a Goshawk’s mouth standing on a small boat and speeding forward.</p><p>When he got close to the lightning zone, a terrifying power of lightning also burst out from his body.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The lightning between heaven and earth continued to bombard the man. The man’s body also burst out with the power of lightning to resist the lightning outside. His figure drove the small boat and disappeared into the vast lightning in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Could this person be a member of the Thunder clan?”</p><p>Huang Ling said with a serious expression.</p><p>“Thunder clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious.</p><p>Thunder clan is an ancient clan. This kind of ancient clan has been passed down for countless years. They are all extremely powerful and their foundations are unfathomable. Even many of the powerful forces in ancient Moon Holy Land can’t compare to this ancient clan!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Following that, there were others steering the small boats and rushing towards the lightning zone.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>ah! suddenly, a scream was heard. A young man couldn’t withstand the power of the lightning and was turned into ashes.</p><p>“You’re not a Saint yet, and you’re here to die!”</p><p>A woman with a cold expression said indifferently, and her figure disappeared into the sea of lightning.</p><p>Not all the geniuses who entered were very powerful. Some of them had not become Saints yet.</p><p>This made a small number of young people’s faces turn ugly, and they didn’t dare to go forward.</p><p>However, most of the young men didn’t show any fear. They steered the small boats and charged into the lightning to fight against it.</p><p>A few of the young men exploded out with heaven-shaking, earth-shattering auras that caused the faces of the others to change.</p><p>what a powerful cultivation. This is the aura of an absolute Saint!</p><p>Huang Ling’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>One must know that these people were all very young. They were definitely below the age of 50 and belonged to the younger generation.</p><p>It was shocking that he had reached the absolute Saint realm at such a young age.</p><p>this time, many powerful heaven’s favorites from the yuan continent have come. It’s normal to have absolute Saints!</p><p>Said Long Chen. His expression was still calm.</p><p>“Let’s go over too!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them steered the boat and charged into the sea of lightning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
