It was his first time seeing Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline. Moreover, Lu Ming had already collected a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>...</p><p>After a moment of silence, the cloud Dragon Valley master said, ” Ming ‘er, it’s all thanks to you that we were able to get two ancient treasures this time. What’s useful to the sect is the other treasure. The fragment of the prison-suppressing stele is just a supplementary treasure. It’s not very useful. It’s not a problem for me to get it for you.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>“This is what you deserve, but there’s a problem. Three years later, when the treasure sealing assembly begins, it will be difficult to explain to the other sects!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Three years later, if the other sects get first place, it won’t be too late for me to hand it over then!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At most, Lu Ming would think of a way to let Dragon God Valley continue to be number one in three years. In that case, there would be no need to hand over the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Lu Ming was still not strong enough. If he had the strength to rule the Azure region, he would have left the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele behind. No one would dare to say no.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll come to find you in a few days!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>As expected, two days later, the cloud Dragon Valley master found Lu Ming and handed the fragment of the prison suppressing stele to him.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s talent and performance at the treasure auction, he had gained the attention of the high-level officials of Dragon God Valley. The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley went to get the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele for Lu Ming without much effort. The only obstacle was the valley master of Silver Dragon.</p><p>However, the master of Silver Dragon Valley could not disobey the others.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram and took out the fragment of the prison-guarding stele.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming took out the fragment of the prison-guarding stele, it flew into the air and emitted a mysterious wave.</p><p>There were gaps on both ends of this piece, and in the middle, there was the word ‘prison’.</p><p>The fluctuations it emitted were exactly the same as the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele that Lu Ming had.</p><p>it’s indeed a fragment of the prison-guarding stele. It’s a part of the middle!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He could feel the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline on his spine stirring restlessly.</p><p>With a thought, the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele emerged, emitting a brilliant light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The broken piece of the prison-guarding stele seemed to resonate with the stele. It shook violently and then flew to the bloodline of the prison-guarding stele, leaning against the broken piece with the word ‘stele’ on it.</p><p>The two holes were exactly the same.</p><p>When the two of them were leaning against each other, the light on the prison-suppressing stele became even brighter. It was extremely bright and gave off an ancient and heavy feeling.</p><p>Lu Ming could vaguely sense that there was a terrifying suppressive force that seemed to be able to suppress the heavens.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>At this moment, another piece of information appeared in Lu Ming’s mind. It was the information about the prison suppressing heaven technique. This piece of information was similar to what Lu Ming had received previously, but it was more complete and exquisite.</p><p>“The power of the prison suppressing heavenly art can only get stronger!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He carefully comprehended it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation and put away the prison-suppressing stele. Then, he left the mountain and river diagram and flew out of the Dragon God Valley to a wasteland.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm. His palm seemed to have transformed into a prison-suppressing stele. It looked realistic and was blasted toward a barren mountain peak.</p><p>The mountain was shattered into pieces.</p><p>Then, with a single thought, a Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele suddenly appeared around him. Then, the number of Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele increased, and finally, there were twelve pieces, which pressed down on the ground.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The ground shook violently, and terrifying cracks appeared.</p><p>“The power of the prison suppressing heavenly art has indeed become stronger, and even more mysterious!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>The prison suppressing heaven technique was originally very wondrous. As his cultivation level increased, its power would also increase.</p><p>He seemed to be borrowing the bloodline power of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Now, the two fragments of the prison-suppressing stele had merged into one. There was no doubt that when Lu Ming used the prison-suppressing heaven technique, the power would skyrocket and surpass the primal Chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>Yes, Lu Ming’s current prison suppressing heaven technique was more powerful than the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>After all, the chaos sky-turning seal was only a domain martial art technique. However, Lu Ming had already comprehended the chaos laws. The power of his domain martial art technique could no longer keep up.</p><p>Unless Lu Ming had comprehended a magical power Technique based on the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>However, one had to reach the martial Saint realm and have the Saint power, the combination of Saint power, and laws to be able to successfully cultivate it.</p><p>The chaos Scripture contained supernormal abilities related to the chaos laws.</p><p>However, it was extremely difficult to comprehend a divine power. Unless one was extremely talented, ordinary saints would find it difficult to comprehend.</p><p>In fact, there were magical powers in the thirteen top sects of the Azure region. However, Lu Ming had encountered so many saints, but none of them had successfully comprehended it. Otherwise, Lu Ming might not have been able to kill enemies who were of a higher realm.</p><p>Lu Ming experimented a little more before returning to Cloud Dragon Valley to continue cultivating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had already passed since the treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming left Dragon God Valley. He turned into a stream of light and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming arrived in the territory of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>He had not seen Xie nianqing for a long time and missed him.</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing did not show up at the treasure sealing assembly. Lu Ming was inexplicably worried. Since he was free now, he decided to visit Xie nianqing and give him some Phoenix incense wood.</p><p>In front of him, layers of demon mountains appeared.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Lu Ming was blocked by two young men at the entrance of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>“Who are you? What business do you have with my Tian Yu demon sect?”</p><p>One of the young men asked.</p><p>I’m lu Ming. I’m here to see your sect’s Holy maiden, Nian Qing. Please inform her!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? You’re Lu Ming!”</p><p>The two young men’s expressions changed and they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s reputation in the Azure continent was too well-known. There was no one in the large sects who did not know him.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming of the Dragon God Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>I’m afraid you’ve come at the wrong time to find our saintess. Our saintess is in closed-door cultivation and won’t see any guests!</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>“He’s in closed-door cultivation?”</p><p>“Please inform them that if the saintess knows that I’m here, she’ll definitely meet me!” Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve told you. The saintess is in seclusion and won’t meet with outsiders. You should leave!”</p><p>The young man said again, his face turning cold.</p><p>Lu Ming’s brows furrowed even more. He had been sending voice transmissions to Xie nianqing, but he could not get them out. Could it be that he was really in seclusion?</p><p>However, even if he was in seclusion, as long as it was not too important, it was fine to inform him.</p><p>“The two of you, please inform your sect master that I would like to pay my respects to him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to pay a visit to the sect leader of the sky demon sect first before asking about Xie nianqing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
