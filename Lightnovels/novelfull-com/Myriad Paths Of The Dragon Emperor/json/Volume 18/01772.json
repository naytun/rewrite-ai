He trembled and retreated from the vast land, opening his eyes.</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone stopped their cultivation.</p><p>half a month has passed. Now, the duels will begin. The duels are very simple. The 100 of you will step onto the battle platform at the same time and begin a chaotic battle. Those who fall off the platform or are killed will be eliminated!</p><p>the last twenty people standing on the fighting ring will advance!</p><p>The white-robed old man announced the rules.</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered. Out of a hundred people, only twenty would advance. Moreover, it would be a chaotic battle. This was much more complicated.</p><p>“Now, let’s begin!”</p><p>The white-robed old man announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>The fighting stage was very large. It was spacious even with 100 people.</p><p>The 100 of them stood on their own and looked around cautiously.</p><p>This was a chaotic battle, and it could be said that everyone was an enemy.</p><p>For a moment, no one made a move. The best choice now was to wait for others to fight while they reserved their strength and reap the benefits.</p><p>The atmosphere became a little heavy.</p><p>The white-robed old man wasn’t in a hurry and just watched quietly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The chaotic body glared at Lu Ming, its cold killing intent undisguisable.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>The chaotic body walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes burned with a strong desire to fight. Saint power surged in his hand and condensed into a long spear. He stepped forward and walked towards the chaotic body.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of anyone at the same level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Before Lu Ming and the chaotic body could fight, a huge battle had already broken out on the other side.</p><p>The child of death, even if everything was suppressed, was still incomparably powerful. He attacked first, completely suppressing a heaven’s pride expert. In just a few moves, the heaven’s pride expert coughed up blood and was blasted off the fighting stage.</p><p>After being thrown off the fighting ring, the young man was enveloped by a pillar of light and left.</p><p>This made many people’s gazes turn grave.</p><p>It was obvious that the child of death’s comprehension was shocking. In just half a month, he had cultivated a secret technique to an extremely high level.</p><p>Furthermore, the son of death’s battle sense was shocking, and he completely crushed that heaven’s favorite.</p><p>The child of death’s attack broke the stalemate, and the others also made their moves.</p><p>A chaotic battle broke out at this moment.</p><p>Some of them charged at Long Chen, Phoenix spirit, and bubbles.</p><p>“Mountain suppressing fist, kill!”</p><p>At that moment, the son of chaos arrived in front of Lu Ming and threw a punch. His fist force exploded and formed a mountain that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a secret skill that the son of chaos had comprehended in the past half a month. It was a fist technique that could form a mountain to suppress a powerful enemy with an astonishing aura and incomparably overbearing.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a Dragon’s Roar, Lu Ming pierced through the mountain with the spear in his hand. The spear instantly transformed into a true dragon and pounced forward. The dragon’s claws stepped in the air and bombarded the mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a terrifying explosion, the true dragon and the mountain exploded. The terrifying force spread in all directions, making the expressions of the people around them very serious.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>On the side, many people were amazed.</p><p>Lu Ming had just exchanged a blow with the chaotic body and its power had already surpassed many people.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The chaotic body roared. Its presence was like a rainbow and it was overbearing. It threw out two consecutive punches with an unstoppable force.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sky was boiling and mountains were formed, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled and turned into rays of spear radiance that burst out. The spear radiance formed true dragons in the air that roared and charged, colliding with the mountain continuously.</p><p>The terrifying energy spread out in all directions. In the area where the two were fighting, the others hurriedly retreated, afraid of being implicated.</p><p>The two of them were destined enemies, and a life-and-death battle was inevitable. In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>The chaotic body was truly terrifying. In just half a month, he had cultivated a secret technique to an extremely profound level. His battle sense was also extremely strong, and every move was terrifyingly powerful. Even people of the same level would not be able to block a few moves.</p><p>The more they fought, the more intense it became. Up until now, the two of them had almost turned into two afterimages, constantly colliding with each other on the fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sparkling and dazzling. The long spear in his hand was constantly thrust out. The more he fought, the deeper his understanding of the Coiling Dragon Spear became.</p><p>At this time, he was already slowly starting to gain the upper hand.</p><p>The son of chaos howled and fought with all his might. However, he could not change this. He was beginning to be suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>He couldn’t accept this, and his expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands seemed to have turned into a stream of light. It was getting faster and faster, and its power was getting stronger and stronger. Often, with a sweep of the spear, it could break his moves.</p><p>A spear thrust out, aimed directly at his vital point, forcing him to Dodge.</p><p>The body of the chaotic body began to retreat toward the edge of the stage.</p><p>“The chaotic body is about to lose!”</p><p>Many people saw it from the corner of their eyes and were shocked.</p><p>The chaotic body was actually no match for someone of the same level.</p><p>Of course, this so-called battle of equals was not really a battle of equals. For example, the advantages of the chaotic body could not be displayed. However, it was enough to show how terrifying Lu Ming was.</p><p>He did not have the chaotic body, but he was able to comprehend the Laws of Chaos. His comprehension was truly astonishing.</p><p>Many people had this thought.</p><p>“So that’s all the chaotic body can do. You only know how to use your higher cultivation to suppress others. In a battle of the same level, what do you think you are?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice rang out, causing the chaotic body’s face to turn even gloomier. In a moment of carelessness, he was swept by Lu Ming’s spear and a wound appeared on his body, blood flowing out.</p><p>Gradually, the chaotic body retreated to the edge of the stage. If it retreated any further, it would fall off.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s join forces and blast this Lu Ming down. This person was ranked first when he crossed the abyss before. His comprehension is amazing. If this continues, I’m afraid no one can compare to him!”</p><p>At this moment, the chaotic body roared.</p><p>He actually wanted to ask the others to join forces with him. For this, he even said that Lu Ming’s comprehension was amazing. Previously, he was high and mighty and thought that he was the real son of chaos. He looked down on Lu Ming, but now, he was praising Lu Ming. This made him feel extremely humiliated.</p><p>However, in order to defeat and eliminate Lu Ming, he could only do so.</p><p>Instantly, the eyes of a few powerful heaven’s favorites lit up.</p><p>Indeed, although Lu Ming’s cultivation level was not high, his potential was shocking. When they crossed the abyss, he was ranked first, which caught the attention of many geniuses.</p><p>Now, he was suppressing the chaotic body in a battle of the same level. If this continued, he would truly be invincible.</p><p>These paragons had all come for the Hunyuan sect’s inheritance. Naturally, they all wanted to be number one and did not want to be suppressed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young man in a white robe forced his opponent to retreat with one move and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was a terrifying heaven’s favorite. When they crossed the abyss, he was already at the top.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
