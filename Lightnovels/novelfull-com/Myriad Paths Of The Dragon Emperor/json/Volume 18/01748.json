In a month, the Holy Sons and holy virgins of the Phoenix Palace will enter a destroyed Phoenix nest in search of the heart of a Wutong tree. Every Holy Virgin and Holy Son can invite a few friends to help them. I was thinking of asking you for help. If we succeed, we might be able to meet the palace Master!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>we’re friends. Even if this didn’t happen, I’d still help you. It’s just that there are so many heaven’s favorites in ancient Moon Holy Land. With my cultivation level, I’m afraid I can’t help you!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“No, because only those in the bright Saint realm are allowed to enter this time!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The four of them talked as they walked. Huang Ling also explained the situation in detail.</p><p>It turned out that not long ago, the Phoenix Palace had discovered a Phoenix’s nest. Unfortunately, the Phoenix’s nest had been destroyed long ago, and all the phoenixes in the Phoenix’s nest had died.</p><p>An expert from the Phoenix Palace had entered the Phoenix’s nest to investigate, but he was surrounded by the Phoenix’s spirit and had escaped with heavy injuries.</p><p>After many tests, the Phoenix Palace found out that there were many heroic spirits of dead phoenixes in the Phoenix Nest. These heroic spirits were usually dormant and would attack together if outsiders entered.</p><p>The more powerful an existence was, the more powerful the heroic spirit would be alerted. Even the Phoenix Palace’s monarch-tier experts were forced to retreat after being seriously injured.</p><p>The lower the cultivation level, the less likely it was to alert the stronger heroic spirits. At most, it would alert some of the weaker heroic spirits.</p><p>The experts of the Phoenix Palace also discovered that there was an ancient parasol tree in the Phoenix’s nest that had condensed the heart of the parasol tree. This was a priceless treasure to the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Therefore, the Phoenix Palace had decided to send the bright Saint realm Saints and saintesses of the Phoenix Palace into the Phoenix’s nest to get the heart of the Wutong. Each of them could invite three friends outside the Phoenix Palace to help.</p><p>In fact, this was a test for these Holy Sons and holy virgins. Whoever could get the heart of the parasol tree would be more valued by the Phoenix Palace, and their status would be higher than the other Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>The four of them chatted as they walked. Not long after, a majestic mountain peak appeared in front of them. This mountain peak was like a phoenix with its wings spread out. It was extremely life-like.</p><p>There were many palaces built on the mountain peak. This was the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the cultivation environment here was better than other places.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Xu Ran, from now on, you’ll be living in Phoenix Palace. How about it?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“I can’t ask for more!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>Staying here was much better than staying in an Inn.</p><p>Xu Ran naturally nodded.</p><p>The four of them flew into the Phoenix Palace. Huang Ling arranged a place for Lu Ming to stay and then brought them on a tour of the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>After touring around, the group arrived at Lu Ming’s residence. It was a courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’ll try my best to report the matter regarding evil spirit to the higher-ups and see if I can meet the palace Master. You guys can stay here. If anything happens, you can contact me at any time!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>After Huang Ling and mu Qingxue left, Lu Ming and Xu Ran each went into a room and cultivated on their own.</p><p>Time flew by, and a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the chaos finger tribulation arduously. Now that he had reached eighteen percent mastery, its power had increased by a few more points.</p><p>Three people were gathered in a courtyard in the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>They were Huang Ling, Lu Ming, and mu Qingxue.</p><p>It was only then that Lu Ming knew that mu Qingxue was one of the people whom Huang Ling had invited to help.</p><p>that Qin Feng guy is really slow. He’s still not here!</p><p>Mu Qingxue snorted.</p><p>Every Holy Son and Holy Virgin could invite three friends to help them. Now that Lu Ming and mu Qingxue had arrived, they were still short of one friend.</p><p>“Anyway, there’s still time. Let’s wait a little longer!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the sky.</p><p>A young man stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>This person was dressed in a white robe and was quite handsome. He stepped down from the sky and smiled, ” “Huang Ling, I’m sorry I’m late!”</p><p>“I thought you weren’t coming!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue said coldly, as if she didn’t like this person.</p><p>Mu Qingxue’s attitude didn’t anger the young man. He still had a smile on his face as he turned to look at Lu Ming.”Feng Ling, who is this?”</p><p>he’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming. His name is Qin Feng!</p><p>Huang Ling introduced.</p><p>“It’s brother Lu!”</p><p>Qin Feng cupped his fists.</p><p>“Brother Qin!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists, but he had a feeling that Qin ran’s smile was very fake.</p><p>Qin Feng sized Lu Ming up and said, ” “Brother Lu, you look very unfamiliar, are you not from ancient Moon Holy Land?”</p><p>“No, I’m from the Azure continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The Azure continent?”</p><p>The corners of Qin Feng’s mouth twitched slightly, revealing a hint of contempt. Although he hid it very quickly, Lu Ming still noticed it.</p><p>“I wonder what’s brother Lu’s current cultivation level?”</p><p>Qin Feng asked again. Lu Ming had cast an illusionary technique to cover up the aura of his cultivation, so Qin Feng could not tell.</p><p>hey, Qin Feng, you’re asking too much. What’s Lu Ming’s cultivation level? why should he tell you? ”</p><p>Mu Qingxue said unhappily.</p><p>Qingxue, you’re wrong. Since we’re a team and we’re going to Enter the Phoenix’s nest together to help Feng Ling complete her mission, we naturally have to understand the other’s cultivation level. That way, it’ll be easier for us to work together, right? ”</p><p>Qin Yang smiled. His words seemed reasonable, leaving mu Qingxue speechless.</p><p>it’s just my cultivation level. There’s nothing to hide. My cultivation level is at the lower tier of the bright Saint realm!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Initial bright Saint?”</p><p>This time, Qin Feng’s contempt was even more obvious. to be honest, the initial bright Saint realm isn’t enough. Huang Ling, if you can’t find any friends, I can introduce you to a few. They’ll at least be in the upper tier of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>Although Qin Feng still had a smile on his face, his contempt was already very obvious.</p><p>Huang Ling’s brows furrowed and she looked unhappy. there’s no need. I believe that Lu Ming’s combat strength is not weaker than that of a great mastery bright Saint. He will definitely be of great help.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>The corners of Qin Feng’s mouth curled up into a sneer, and he did not say anything more.</p><p>“Alright, it’s getting late. Let’s go!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Immediately, the four of them rose into the air and soon arrived at the top of a mountain.</p><p>There were already quite a few people on the peak. Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and discovered that there were twenty-four people. They were grouped into six groups of four.</p><p>Obviously, they were the other Holy Sons and holy virgins of the Phoenix Palace and the friends they had invited.</p><p>Including Huang Ling and the others, there were seven groups in total.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they were met with cold gazes.</p><p>“Eh? The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and saw the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow looking at him coldly.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also discovered many familiar faces.</p><p>For example, Wan Tianlong of the WAN family and the heaven’s favorite of the wilderness sword sect.</p><p>Four or five of them had stepped onto the Jade pool saintess Pavilion a month ago. Unexpectedly, they had all been invited by the Phoenix Palace’s Saint and saintess.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
