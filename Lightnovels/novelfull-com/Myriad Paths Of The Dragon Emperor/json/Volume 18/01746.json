We’ll fight again!</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>...</p><p>At that moment, the other paragons and the tenth golden Crow Prince charged at Lu Ming. Their combined might was terrifying as they used all sorts of divine abilities to obliterate Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids did not even move. His palm shook and slashed out like a blade.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was flowing with the power of the law of chaos. There seemed to be a prison-suppressing stele in his palm that could suppress everything.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>As the palm struck down, the divine abilities and techniques were scattered like bubbles. Lu Ming was like an immortal God of War as he continued to step forward, not allowing any spells to touch him.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince and company’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>The few of them joined forces but they could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and continued to strike with his palm.</p><p>A few of them did their best to exchange blows with Lu Ming. They trembled as if they had been electrocuted and were sent flying. The qi and blood in their bodies churned and the bones in their arms seemed to be about to crack.</p><p>Lu Ming had already shown mercy. If he had given it his all, no one here would survive.</p><p>Only the tenth Prince of the Golden Crow clan was still on the Jade stairs. He looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>“Why aren’t you getting lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is the ancient Moon Holy Land. My golden Crow clan is in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Give me some face and give me this Pavilion. I can let bygones be bygones for the hundred clan battlefield!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m giving you face, but Who Do You Think You Are? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and grabbed one of the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s wings. With a swing, he threw the Golden Crow tenth Prince out.</p><p>This tenth Prince of the Golden Crow clan was a joke. He couldn’t win, so he used the Golden Crow clan to threaten him. He didn’t believe that the elders of the Golden Crow clan would have the nerve to intervene in a fight between peers.</p><p>Therefore, he didn’t need to be nice to the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince steadied himself in the distance. He gritted his teeth and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>In another Pavilion, the Ninth Crown Prince of the Golden crow’s eyes also turned cold.</p><p>Who the hell dared to call the tenth golden Crow Prince?</p><p>What about him?</p><p>Scolding the tenth golden Crow Prince like that was the same as scolding him.</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince was thrown down the Jade stairs. There was no one left on the Jade stairs.</p><p>“Xu Ran, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xu Ran, who was in a daze. He stepped forward and walked into the ninth Pavilion with Xu Ran.</p><p>The nine pavilions were all occupied.</p><p>“How should I address this young master? You truly suppressed everyone else, this little sister is impressed!”</p><p>In the ninth Pavilion, there was a woman in a purple dress. Her skin was like jade, and she had a heavenly fragrance. She looked at Lu Ming with her beautiful eyes and a sweet smile. She was extremely beautiful.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>“Xu Ran!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran cupped their fists.</p><p>“This little girl is Zi Ling. Please sit down, Zi Ling will pour wine for you two!”</p><p>Zi Ling said.</p><p>miss Ziling, you’re too polite. This time, I’m here to help Brother Xu. Brother Xu admires the Jade Lake Saint a lot!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled slightly and pushed Xu Ran forward.</p><p>“You’re too kind, I’m just here to gain some experience!”</p><p>Xu Ran quickly declined. He knew very well that with his talent, the Jade Lake Saint would not take a fancy to him. He was only here to experience and join in the fun. He did not expect that Lu Ming would bring him to the pavilion and sit at the same table with the Jade Lake Saint.</p><p>At this moment, he couldn’t help but feel a little helpless.</p><p>“The two of you are so reluctant. It seems that Zi Ling’s charm is not enough to enter the eyes of the two young masters!”</p><p>Zi Ling sighed slightly, and her eyes revealed a hidden bitterness.</p><p>Zi Ling was originally a national beauty, and with such an expression, it was really tempting. Any man would be moved.</p><p>“Lady Ziling, you misunderstand!”</p><p>Xu Ran said hurriedly. Lu Ming also revealed a trace of embarrassment.</p><p>Then, Zi Ling smiled and said, ” I was just joking with you two. Come, it’s our first time meeting. Here’s a toast to you two!</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran picked up their glasses and downed their drinks.</p><p>Zi Ling was very talkative. She quickly broke the awkward atmosphere and had a good chat with Lu Ming and Xu Ran.</p><p>Obviously, the Jade Lake saintess had received special training, and dealing with people was one of them. Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so many peerless talents who had fallen under the Jade Lake saintess ‘skirt since ancient times.</p><p>Outside the pavilion, many people were envious. Who wouldn’t want to drink and chat with the Jade Lake Saint?</p><p>It was the same in the other pavilions, and they were having a good time.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, two Jade tokens appeared in Zi Ling’s hands. She handed them to Lu Ming and Xu Ran and said,”It’s getting late, and Ziling is going back to cultivate. If you two have time in the future, you can send a message to Ziling, or come to the Jade pool Celestial Palace as a guest!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran took the Jade cards.</p><p>definitely. I’ll take my leave then!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and left the pavilion.</p><p>Xu Ran also left the pavilion, somewhat reluctant to leave.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you moved?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>sigh, with miss Ziling’s talent, why would she be interested in me? there are more people competing to be a Guardian. If it’s you, Lu Ming, it’s possible!</p><p>Xu Ran sighed.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that easy to become a guardian. All he had to do was step into a Pavilion. Today, the Holy Virgin of the Jade Lake had come to this world, and he just wanted to make some friends.</p><p>In the future, they would have to spend more time together, and the other elites could compete with each other. In the end, they could win the Beauty’s heart and become the real Guardian of the Jade Lake Saint.</p><p>“It’s impossible for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He had come here to seek help from the Holy Land’s forces, not to pick up girls.</p><p>When the people in the nine pavilions left, the space rippled again. Then, the nine pavilions and the Jade Lake immortal Palace all disappeared into the void.</p><p>“A small world?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Emperor-level experts ‘Saint hearts could condense a small world that was like a real world.</p><p>The Jade Lake divine Palace probably had many Emperor-level experts. It was very normal for them to have small worlds.</p><p>In fact, many Emperor-ranked forces only had their headquarters on the surface, but it was not their true core. The true core was the small world of the Emperor-ranked powerhouses.</p><p>It was definitely more mysterious and vast than the mountain and river diagram. After all, the mountain and river diagram was only a treasure created by an Emperor-level expert.</p><p>“Brat, stop!”</p><p>Just as the two of them were about to leave, a cold voice was heard. Two golden lights flashed and two figures appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The Golden crow’s tenth and ninth princes.</p><p>brat, how dare you insult the Golden Crow race? you are courting death! Kneel down and apologize now!</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow said coldly. He was dressed in a golden robe and his body was covered in Golden Solar Fire, burning and distorting the space.</p><p>“After beating the small one, a big one will come. I wonder if an old one will come after beating the big one!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly and he said in disdain.</p><p>“Arrogant! Do you think you’re my ninth brother’s match?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince called out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
