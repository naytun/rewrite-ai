It was not surprising that the three sects stood together.</p><p>This way, there were five absolute Saints. The Ice Dragon patriarch, Cloud Dragon Valley master, and the life and death Sword sect leader were more powerful than normal absolute Saints.</p><p>This was a terrifying power.</p><p>“Why did you guys bring this little guy here?”</p><p>The demon Castle Lord’s eyes were like two suns as he looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>The valley master told him about the situation that Lu Ming had learned from Mo Yang’s soul search, as well as Lu Ming’s plan.</p><p>so, the Tian Yu demon sect is also a remnant of evil spirit. I’ve long guessed that there are other sects that are remnants of evil spirit, but I didn’t expect it to be the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>The demon Castle Lord’s body emitted a golden light, and his voice was cold.</p><p>it’s a good time to reveal the truth this time. Perhaps we can catch all the evil spirit remnants!</p><p>The sect leader’s voice was also very cold.</p><p>Then, they discussed the details and waited quietly.</p><p>Three days later, many sects would gather at the Tianyu demonic sect to form an alliance.</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect was bustling with activity.</p><p>This time, six of the twelve top-tier sects of the Azure continent had gathered on the sky demon sect’s demon mountain.</p><p>The Tian Yu demonic sect, Yu Du sect, Tian Shen sect, evil moon sect, blood demon tower, and jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>As for the sky King Palace, Linglong Palace, and poyuan family, the three major forces chose to remain neutral and watch. No one came forward.</p><p>As for the life-and-death Sword sect and the demon Castle, they naturally wouldn’t come.</p><p>There were six top sects and dozens of other small and medium-sized forces.</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect was packed with people.</p><p>On a towering demon mountain, there was a huge Hall. In front of the hall, there were many banquet tables. The experts of the six top sects, including the Tianyu demon sect and the tianshen sect, were all sitting at the top. There were also some leaders of the small and medium-sized forces.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect sat at the head of the table. He looked around and said, ” this Alliance is meant to destroy Dragon God Valley. Do you have any suggestions? ”</p><p>I think that if we can force Lu Ming to hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, there’s no need to fight to the death with Dragon God Valley. We’ll suffer 800 losses even if we lose 1000 enemies. If we fight to the death with Dragon God Valley, our losses will not be small either!</p><p>&Nbsp; the evil moon sect sect leader said. His words immediately received the approval of some of the smaller factions.</p><p>Their alliance this time was for Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, not to fight to the death with Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“You’re wrong. With Lu Ming’s current achievements, if he doesn’t die, who can rival him when he grows up in the future? If Dragon God Valley was not destroyed, it would definitely cause endless trouble in the future. How could it not be destroyed? If we don’t, we’ll be the ones in danger in the future!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>The others ‘expressions changed. The sect master of the sky demon sect was not bad.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was too strong. If he grew up in the future and harbored a grudge, with the support of Dragon God Valley, no one would be able to defeat him. All the sects that had participated in this matter were in danger.</p><p>in my opinion, not only Dragon God Valley should be destroyed, but the life and death Sword sect and Demon Castle should also be destroyed one by one. This way, we can eliminate all future troubles. Moreover, we can divide the territory they occupy equally. In this way, our sect will be stronger!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect continued with a cold look in his eyes.</p><p>If she didn’t start a war, how could she obtain the souls of powerful Saints for the blood demon discipline King to absorb? How could they weaken the power of the Azure continent?</p><p>Therefore, the most important thing was not to destroy Lu Ming. The most important thing was to start a war.</p><p>Just as the various sects were discussing, Lu Ming arrived ‘alone’ outside the Tian Yu demonic sect. He did not stop and headed straight for the sect.</p><p>“Who’s there? Stop?”</p><p>Someone shouted. A few young guards of the sky demon sect appeared. When they saw Lu Ming, their faces changed and they shouted,”Lu Ming, Lu Ming is here!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The sky rumbled and the young guards spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Figures flew out from the Tianyu demonic sect. A few of them had powerful auras and were obviously in the Saint realm.</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming, their expressions changed drastically. Someone shouted, ” “Quickly report to the sect master!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and shouted. He activated the divine sword technique. The few Saints screamed in pain as their souls were destroyed by Lu Ming’s divine sword technique.</p><p>Lu Ming exuded a cold killing intent as he stepped forward in the air. Those below the Saint realm were pale. They did not dare to stop Lu Ming and retreated.</p><p>Many experts were in the middle of a discussion in the lofty Hall when a few figures suddenly flew over in a hurry.</p><p>The sect master’s face darkened as he chided, ” “What’s the rush? can’t you see that I’m discussing important matters with the sect Masters?”</p><p>“Sect master, Lu Ming is here,” one of the elders quickly said.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming? How many people are there?”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect asked.</p><p>“Just one person, just Lu Ming alone!”</p><p>The old man replied.</p><p>how dare he barge in here alone! Sect leader, I’ll go out and capture Lu Ming!</p><p>A great saint from the Tian Yu demonic sect said.</p><p>“Wait a minute. It’s impossible for Lu Ming to come here alone to die. He must be up to something. Let’s all go out and see what he’s up to. What do you think, everyone?”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>alright, who cares what tricks he has up his sleeves. There are so many of us here. He won’t stand a chance. Let’s take this opportunity to capture Lu Ming and force him to hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. Haha!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The experts of the various sects all headed out of the demon mountain.</p><p>Soon, they saw some disciples of the sky demon sect retreating while Lu Ming walked alone in the air. No one could stop him.</p><p>This made the sect master of the sky demon sect’s face turn gloomy.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect scanned the surroundings before his gaze landed on Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, who else is with you? tell them to show themselves!”</p><p>“If you want the others to show themselves, we’ll have to see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. He stood tall and straight, his eyes shining with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>His meaning was self-evident.</p><p>arrogant! I was careless last time. This time, I’ll take you down!</p><p>An old man in a white robe stepped out. It was mo kong, the expert from the tianshen sect who had fought with Lu Ming last time.</p><p>“Senior mo kong, I’ll help you!”</p><p>A middle-aged brawny man stepped out of the Tian Yu demon sect. He exuded a shocking aura. He was a great circle bright Saint, no weaker than mo kong.</p><p>Moreover, after knowing Lu Ming’s combat strength, those who dared to stand out had most likely cultivated a divine power Technique and were very confident in their combat strength.</p><p>“Add me!”</p><p>An old man from the desire poison sect also walked out. He was also in the great circle of the bright Saint stage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
