It was dazzling and even more resplendent than the sun in the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>As the long spear pierced through the air, the space around it rippled as if it was about to be pierced.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear pierced the protective array of Dragon God Valley. The light curtain caved in and almost collapsed.</p><p>“Dragon God’s Seven Valleys, get into formation and prepare to face the enemy!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! Ice Dragon Valley master ordered.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley, the disciples of each Valley gathered together and set up a big array.</p><p>However, Yin Zheng and the people of Silver Dragon Valley were hiding at the back.</p><p>“There’s no way we, the silver Dragon Valley, will work for that kid, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yin Zheng sneered. He secretly ordered the elders and disciples of Silver Dragon Valley to hide in the back and not attack when the battle began.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The sect-protecting formation kept shaking. The formation formed by the experts of the three sects was too powerful. The sect-protecting formation of Dragon God Valley couldn’t hold on for long.</p><p>“Hateful!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly. He looked at the three major sects who were attacking wildly outside, his eyes burning with fire.</p><p>If he could, he would rather hand over Emperor Cang’s storage ring to end this war.</p><p>However, it was clear that even if he handed over Emperor Cang’s storage ring, this battle was inevitable.</p><p>This was because the other party would be insatiable and want him to hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance.</p><p>He even handed over his other secrets to search his soul.</p><p>An ordinary man’s possession of a jade pendant was a crime. It was all because his strength was too weak. If he had the strength to sweep across the Azure continent, like Emperor Cang, ruling a region, the heavenly God sect and other sects would not dare to even let out a fart. They would only obediently grovel at his feet.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon God Valley’s sect-protecting array was shaking more and more violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A loud explosion was heard on some of the big snow mountains in Dragon God Valley. The array base had exploded due to the strong pressure.</p><p>Some of the formation foundations cracked and the formation’s power became weaker.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>Some parts of the sect’s Grand protective array had cracked. As more and more cracks appeared, it finally exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>……</p><p>The experts of the three sects formed a great formation and rushed toward Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The four absolute Saints took the lead and charged in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>The valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley flew up and faced the four absolute Saints.</p><p>The four experts flew into the sky and engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The other experts of the three sects formed a formation. The giant Demon God, Toad, and spear charged at the people of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars were heard in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The experts from each of the Seven Valleys of the Dragon God formed a large array. Instantly, an Ice Dragon, a purple dragon, a Blood Dragon …</p><p>A total of five huge true dragons rose into the sky and faced the huge demonic god.</p><p>Only those from the silver Dragon Valley hid in the back and did not make a move.</p><p>As for the cloud Dragon Valley, due to the lack of people, it was difficult to form such a huge array.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two sides collided with a terrible wind that cracked the ground. The ice Valley at the outermost edge of the Dragon God Valley was cracked by the collision.</p><p>Countless cave abodes were destroyed in the great battle.</p><p>Fortunately, many of the weaker disciples had already retreated to the depths of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, let’s back off!”</p><p>Yang tianzong and the rest appeared beside Lu Ming. The few of them retreated. It was difficult for them to interfere in such a battle between formations.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated with yang tianzong and the rest, his eyes glimmering.</p><p>He was considering whether he should use the reincarnation halberd.</p><p>There were only two forces in the reincarnation halberd. If one was used, one would be gone. It was very precious and Lu Ming did not want to use it unless it was absolutely necessary. However, it seemed that he had no choice but to use it now.</p><p>“Great formation, rise!”</p><p>An old man in the Dragon God Valley shouted. He was a great saint in the Great Perfection realm and was in charge of the battle.</p><p>All the valleys and snow mountains in Dragon God Valley shone with a bright light. Endless wind and snow gathered and finally condensed into a dozen snow dragons that were 10000 feet tall. They pounced toward the formation of the three major sects.</p><p>This was the home ground advantage. In Dragon God Valley, apart from the sect-protecting array, there were many other offensive arrays.</p><p>The offensive formation, coupled with the formation of the Dragon God Valley’s five dragon valleys, made it difficult for the two sides to decide who would win.</p><p>However, it was obvious that the Dragon God valley side was at a disadvantage.</p><p>After all, the three major sects were all elites. The formation of the experts of the entire sect was very powerful. Dragon God Valley was only a sect. Even with the home advantage, they were still no match for it.</p><p>The true dragon formed by the formation kept retreating.</p><p>In the sky, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley were fighting the four absolute Saints, but they were no match for them.</p><p>The situation was getting worse for Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The reincarnation halberd appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Although the two wisps of energy in the reincarnation halberd were precious, he had no choice but to use them now.</p><p>However, at this moment, an earth-shattering Dragon’s Roar came from the depths of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar pierced through the clouds and spread for hundreds of thousands of miles. It was like the roar of an ancient Divine Dragon, terrifying beyond compare.</p><p>Everyone from the three sects was shocked and couldn’t help but look into the depths of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Another Dragon’s Roar was heard. Then, a huge true dragon rushed out of the vast Snow Mountain. Its body was white and crystal clear. It was over 10000 meters long and its dragon claws stepped in the air. In a flash, it appeared on the battlefield.</p><p>Ice Dragon patriarch! It’s Ice Dragon patriarch!</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley cheered.</p><p>Lu Ming, yang tianzong, Tian Chui and the rest were also dumbfounded.</p><p>It was said that in the depths of Dragon God Valley, in the vast and endless snow mountains, lived an Ice Dragon. It had lived for a long time and was The Guardian divine beast of Dragon God Valley. The heavy snow in Dragon God Valley was also because of this Ice Dragon.</p><p>He didn’t expect it to be true.</p><p>“Intruders, get lost!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch roared, and his already huge body grew again. Then, he clawed at the huge demonic god condensed by the Tian Yu demonic sect.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant demonic god was forced back by the Ice dragon’s claw, and a large hole appeared in his chest.</p><p>Then, the divine Dragon swung its tail and swept the huge spear away. The experts who formed the formation seemed to be under a terrible pressure. Their faces turned pale and they almost spat out blood.</p><p>The Ice Dragon then let out a long roar and spat out a terrifying cold current from its mouth, freezing the toad that was laughing tens of thousands of feet long. It made countless experts of the Yu Du sect spit out blood.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch was too powerful. He suppressed the three sects ‘Grand arrays with one move.</p><p>Following that, the Ice Dragon strode forward once more, clawing at the toad. The toad immediately exploded, causing countless experts from the Yu Du sect to retreat in a frenzy, suffering heavy injuries.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The people of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demonic sect quickly retreated, not daring to fight.</p><p>At this moment, the Ice Dragon roared and rushed into the sky toward the battlefield of the absolute Saints.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
