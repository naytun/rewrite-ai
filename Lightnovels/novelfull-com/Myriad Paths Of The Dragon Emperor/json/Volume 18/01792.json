BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming blocked all the attacks from the other young men.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stomped on the ground and countless runes filled the air towards Xu tuo and the rest. They formed a terrifying sealing force to seal them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he unleashed his divine sword technique. Some of the youths with weaker cultivation screamed in pain.</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward with his sword in hand. In an instant, five to six young geniuses were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>An old man roared, extremely furious.</p><p>Lu Ming was so audacious that he dared to make a move in the thousand spirit exchange and kill the young prodigies of the four major forces.</p><p>He was simply lawless.</p><p>At the scene, the others were also extremely shocked. More people rushed out to avoid being affected.</p><p>how dare you hurt my family and friends! Kill them all! They deserve to die!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. Today, he was going to kill all these young men.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>He slashed out with his combat sword, and two more young men were killed on the spot.</p><p>Those below the Supreme Saint realm were no match for him. They couldn’t even block a single strike. As soon as the sword slashed down, they were dead.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu tuo and the other great sage heaven’s pride expert were scared. Their faces turned pale and they retreated frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply a lunatic.</p><p>“You can’t leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming smacked his palm and controlled the array Dao law. Endless runes formed a huge runic scroll that covered a great saint genius.</p><p>The Paragon struggled madly, but what awaited him was Lu Ming’s chaos finger of tribulation.</p><p>A giant finger exuded destructive energy as it pointed at the person.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>This person let out a desperate roar, but he was sealed by the array Dao laws and could not use much of his strength. When the chaos tribulation finger touched him, he screamed and his body was torn apart.</p><p>A Supreme Saint genius had died just like that.</p><p>Even among the younger generation of ancient Moon Holy Land, such a heaven’s favorite was a top existence. He was high and mighty, looking down on his peers. He was destined to become an Emperor in the future, immortal and undying. Now, he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>A few elders let out angry roars. That heaven’s favorite came from their forces.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and unmoved. He fixed his eyes on Xu tuo. His glabella glowed and the Tai Chi disk array flew out. A huge Tai Chi pattern enveloped the entire Hall.</p><p>However, Xu tuo was determined to escape. Just as he was about to escape the hall, a transparent bubble suddenly appeared and enveloped him.</p><p>“Don’t kill me!”</p><p>Xu tuo roared in despair and transformed into his true form, a purple wolf god.</p><p>weren’t you very arrogant before and insulted my Senior Sister? now, where has your arrogance gone to? kill!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, the Tai Chi pattern turned into the Yin Yang fish sword and slashed out. Xu tuo was killed on the spot.</p><p>The second Supreme Saint was killed.</p><p>Who are you? how dare you cause trouble in the thousand spirit trading house!</p><p>At this moment, a long hiss came from the distance. The sound rolled and shot straight into the clouds.</p><p>“Absolute Saint, that’s an absolute Saint!”</p><p>“The absolute Saint is here. Kid, you’re dead!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The heavily injured Wan Pingyang’s eyes were filled with hope. Of course, there was also a crazed killing intent. However, in the next moment, his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s gaze was also on him. He took a step forward and appeared in front of him.</p><p>“You … What are you doing? The absolute Saint has descended, so why aren’t you surrendering?”</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared.</p><p>“It won’t be too late to leave after 1 kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming attacked coldly and waved his combat sword.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Battle Sword slashed down and Wan Pingyang was split into two. His soul was destroyed.</p><p>His eyes were still wide open, full of unwillingness.</p><p>The absolute Saint had already descended, but Lu Ming still wanted to kill him. He had seen hope, but it turned into despair in an instant.</p><p>“Ah -!”</p><p>The elders let out long howls. The losses today were too heavy. More than ten geniuses from the four major forces had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The absolute Saint moved with shocking speed, arriving in the blink of an eye. He sent out his spiritual sense and saw what was happening in the hall, and was furious.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit, Long Chen, let’s go!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted as he soared into the sky and rushed to the top of the hall. He slashed with his sword and the roof of the hall was cut open.</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and bubbles followed closely behind Lu Ming and rushed out.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>The elders in the hall roared and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>The absolute Saint slapped at them from a distance. A terrifying palm print covered the sky and was about to blow Lu Ming and the others up.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>At this moment, with a tender shout, a space-time Tunnel opened. Lu Ming and the other three immediately dashed into the space-time Tunnel and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, the palm print arrived and the space-time Tunnel collapsed. However, Lu Ming and the other three had already appeared tens of thousands of miles away. Then, the bubble opened another space-time Tunnel and the four of them rushed in, disappearing.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s the space-time law!”</p><p>&Nbsp; in the air above the hall, a light flashed, and an old man appeared with cold eyes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Following that, a few other figures appeared from the thousand spirit exchange. All of them had powerful auras, and they were all absolute Saints.</p><p>A few absolute Saints rushed into the hall with dark faces. They looked around, and their faces were so dark that they looked like they were going to bleed.</p><p>The entire Hall was in a mess. More than a dozen Supreme Saints were dead.</p><p>Most importantly, it was a huge loss for a dozen Young heaven’s favorites to die Here.</p><p>One of the absolute Saints came to Wan tianbing. He wasn’t dead, but he had become an idiot.</p><p>report to the family and send out experts. Even if we have to turn the entire ancient Moon Holy Land upside down, we have to find Lu Ming!</p><p>A furious roar reverberated throughout the entire thousand spirit exchange.</p><p>Many people knew that a storm was coming.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, Long Chen, and bubbles were already hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p><p>…..</p><p>Only then did everyone stop.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’ve killed so many paragons of the four great factions and caused such a ruckus in the thousand spirit exchange. I’m afraid the four great factions won’t let this go!</p><p>Huang Ling revealed a worried expression.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me to the divine elephant sect!”</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“We can go to the Phoenix Palace too!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head, let’s split up. I’ll go alone!</p><p>“How can you do that? the four great powers will definitely send out a large number of experts to hunt you down. They might even dispatch Emperor-ranked experts. It’s too dangerous for you to leave alone!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression changed and she looked anxious.</p><p>if 1 go to Phoenix Palace or divine elephant sect with you, and the four forces come to ask for me, will Phoenix Palace or divine elephant sect protect me at the risk of offending the four forces and going to war with them?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Long Chen and Feng Ling Fell silent..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
