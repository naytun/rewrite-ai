I hope you can help each other in the future. Let me tell you, the final battle will come soon. When the time comes, you’ll need to work together to fight the enemy!</p><p>...</p><p>“Now, I’ll send you back!”</p><p>The white-robed elder said. With a wave of his hand, beams of light enveloped Lu Ming and the others. Then, they felt dizzy. After an unknown period of time, Lu Ming found himself back in the Phoenix Palace’s courtyard.</p><p>With him were long Chen, Feng Ling, and of course, bubbles.</p><p>“Lu Ming… Big brother!”</p><p>When bubbles saw Lu Ming, she pounced on him and hung on his shoulder.</p><p>bubbles, your cultivation has reached the Supreme Saint realm!</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and realized that the bubble’s aura was extremely thick. It had actually reached the great saint realm.</p><p>“Yeah, that old man sent me to a place before, and I inexplicably broke through, and something else appeared in my head! Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Pao Pao said in a childish voice.</p><p>it must be related to the inheritance of the space-time spirit mouse!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He was happy for bubbles.</p><p>Lu Ming, Feng Ling, my cultivation has reached the limit of a bright Saint. I feel like I’ll be breaking through soon. I’ll return to the divine elephant sect to cultivate in seclusion!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“Alright, I wish you a smooth breakthrough!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Long Chen nodded, then stepped into the air and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m about to break through too. I’m afraid I’ll need to go into seclusion!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“It just so happens that I also need to go into closed-door cultivation for a period of time!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He had obtained one of the nine scrolls of array Dao, the sealed scroll, and the divine breath technique. He needed to cultivate both of them.</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air rang out. A figure stepped through the air and arrived. It was mu Qingxue.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Feng Ling, you’re finally here. Where have you been for the past few months? 1 couldn’t find you anywhere, and 1 couldn’t transmit my voice either, so I thought something happened to you.”</p><p>As soon as mu Qingxue arrived, she began to complain.</p><p>“Qingxue, how did you know that we’ve returned so quickly?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked curiously.</p><p>I’m just nearby. I saw Long Chen coming out of here. 1 guess you guys are back too!</p><p>Mu Qingxue said.</p><p>Qingxue, I’m sorry. Due to the sudden incident, we were participating in the Hunyuan sect’s examination and didn’t inform you!</p><p>Huang Ling said apologetically, not hiding anything from mu Qingxue.</p><p>“You guys participated in the Hunyuan sect’s test? Lu Ming, no wonder you’ve also obtained a primordial chaos token?”</p><p>Mu Qingxue nodded in realization.</p><p>“Yes. By the way, how long have we been there?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and asked.</p><p>“It’s been four months!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue said.</p><p>“Only four months?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He remembered that it had been more than half a year since he went to Hunyuan sect for the assessment. Perhaps the two months he spent in the tribe during the last assessment was just an illusion and not real. Perhaps it had only been a moment.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>by the way, some of the heaven’s pride experts who went to the heavenly Emperor City have returned. Not long ago, a heaven’s pride expert from the WAN family came and said that he wanted to challenge Lu Ming. In the end, he was blocked by us. Then, the people from the WAN family spread rumors everywhere that Lu Ming encountered a stronger opponent and did not dare to fight. He was like a turtle that hid in its shell!</p><p>Mu Qingxue said.</p><p>“The WAN family again!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.”A bunch of clowns, ignore them!”</p><p>After chatting for a while, Huang Ling and mu Qingxue bade farewell and left. Lu Ming returned to his room and entered the mountain and river diagram to begin his seclusion.</p><p>First, he had to practice the divine breath technique.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the divine breath technique Jade card and studied it carefully. He then started to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the illusionary breath technique before. Although the divine breath technique was wonderful, it was not difficult for Lu Ming. In a short three days, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated it.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming took out the sealed scroll, one of the nine scrolls of the array Dao, and studied it carefully.</p><p>“How wonderful!”</p><p>After a long time, Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>The sealed scroll was able to unleash the wondrous power of the array Dao laws, forming a sealing technique. If cultivated to the highest level, it could even seal the heavens and earth, suppressing everything.</p><p>This was created by a terrifying existence, and it was extremely profound.</p><p>this is only one of the nine scrolls on the Dao of arrays. I wonder how amazing the other eight scrolls are?“</p><p>Lu Ming was really looking forward to it.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. He focused on understanding the path and cultivating the art of sealing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had ended his cultivation because he sensed movement outside. Before he entered the mountain and river diagram, he had set up a sensing array in the courtyard. As long as someone came to look for him, he would be able to sense it.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram. He walked out of his room and saw Huang Ling.</p><p>Huang Ling, congratulations on breaking through to the Supreme Saint realm!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the room and realized that Huang Ling’s aura was much stronger than before. It was obvious that she had made a breakthrough in her cultivation.</p><p>“You’re about to break through, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Oh yes, someone has sent you an invitation!” Huang Ling smiled.</p><p>As she spoke, an invitation card appeared in her hand.</p><p>“An invitation? Who sent it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious.</p><p>Jade Lake, this time, the Jade Lake inheritance Holy maiden has appeared. She’s holding a Tea Party and sending out invitations to all the geniuses of the ancient Moon Holy Land to gather at the Jade Lake!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Holy successor?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He remembered that the last time the Jade lake’s Saint was born, she was not called the Saint of inheritance.</p><p>As if she could read Lu Ming’s mind, Huang Ling explained, the nine holy virgins of the Jade Lake were just ordinary holy virgins. The Holy successor of the Jade Lake is better than ordinary holy virgins in terms of status, talent, and beauty. She has the potential to take over the Jade Lake in the future.</p><p>however, the Jade Lake has very few Holy inheritances, and the selection criteria are very strict. The Jade Lake hasn’t had a Holy inheritances for thousands of years, and this time, they’re inviting many heroes. I’m afraid that there will be many heroes coming to the ancient Moon Holy Land. It will be very lively!</p><p>“Since that’s the case, we can meet up. When?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Tomorrow. I’ll come find you tomorrow. Let’s go together!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>A day passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The next day, Huang Ling and mu Qingxue came to look for Lu Ming. Lu Ming brought bubbles with him and went to the Jade pool.</p><p>…..</p><p>It was still the same Lake as last time. Above the lake, there were many palaces, and the Jade pool immortal Palace appeared.</p><p>Someone came to welcome them in front of the immortal Palace.</p><p>They entered the Jade Lake divine Palace and came to a quiet and beautiful place.</p><p>This area was extremely vast. At this moment, the two sides of the area were already filled with tables. Many people had already arrived.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites from the younger generation. There were both men and women, and they came from all sorts of powerful forces.</p><p>A few young and beautiful women were walking around the tables, pouring tea for the many geniuses.</p><p>In this area, the fragrance of tea assailed the nose.</p><p>At the top of the area, there were nine Jade tables. The nine saintesses of the Jade pool sat at each of the nine tables.</p><p>Behind the nine saintesses, there was a Pavilion floating in the air. There was a flight of stairs that extended to the bottom. There was also a Jade table in the pavilion, but no one was there.</p><p>Many people knew that the Jade Lake Holy Virgin would be sitting in that Pavilion..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
