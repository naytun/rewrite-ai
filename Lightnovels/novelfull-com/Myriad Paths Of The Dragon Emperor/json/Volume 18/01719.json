He began to cultivate in seclusion, planning to refine three drops of the true dragon blood essence.</p><p>Now, the key was to continuously improve his strength.</p><p>...</p><p>If Lu Ming’s spirit body could evolve again, his strength would definitely soar.</p><p>Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and took out a drop of true dragon blood essence. The blood essence exuded a powerful absolute saint’s pressure, causing Lu Ming’s skin to sting.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his devouring power and enveloped the drop of blood essence. He began to devour the spiritual essence in the blood essence and fused it into his body.</p><p>Three days later, the drop of blood essence was completely refined. Lu Ming took out another drop.</p><p>Just like that, nine days later, the three drops of blood essence had been completely refined. The energy had fused into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s accumulation had reached its limit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A dragon roar shook the nine Heavens.</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head in the sky, a huge Dragon appeared. It circled in the sky and roared continuously.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was emitting a dazzling radiance. His muscles were squirming as if there were small dragons swimming in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was undergoing a transformation. His bone armor was constantly becoming stronger. It was a few hundred to a thousand times tougher than a Vajra.</p><p>His muscles were full of elasticity, and once they exploded, they had earth-shattering power.</p><p>His blood was filled with powerful life force and was extremely robust.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body became stronger and stronger. Like a Divine Dragon, his every move was indestructible.</p><p>After a moment, the nine Dragons in the sky rushed into Lu Ming’s body and disappeared. Lu Ming then opened his eyes.</p><p>I’ve successfully evolved. A medium grade heavenly spiritual body!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>He had a medium-grade celestial spiritual body. Moreover, Lu Ming’s body had refined a trace of chaotic Qi. The strength of his spirit body was not weaker than that of a high-grade celestial spiritual body.</p><p>The evolution of the spirit body had increased Lu Ming’s combat strength tremendously.</p><p>Now, if he were to face an expert like mo kong again, he would be able to destroy mo Kong’s Divine Art with one move and kill him with one punch.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming walked out of the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After ten days of seclusion, Lu Ming wanted to find out how the situation in the Azure region was.</p><p>Sure enough, he found out an important piece of information.</p><p>The tianshen sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yudu sect announced to the world that they were inviting all the other forces in the Azure continent to form an alliance in the Tianyu demonic sect in a month’s time. They would destroy the Dragon God Valley and force Lu Ming to hand over the inheritance and treasures of Emperor Cang.</p><p>When this news came out, the entire Azure continent was shaken.</p><p>For a time, the winds and clouds in the Azure region changed, as if a storm was brewing.</p><p>Of the various powers in the Azure continent, there were some who maintained a neutral stance and were observing from the sidelines.</p><p>Some forces were already on their way to the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>“Alliance!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were very cold.</p><p>What a ruthless method. He wanted to unite the many powerful forces of the Azure continent to destroy Dragon God Valley.</p><p>As for why he was at the Tianyu demon sect, it was because the Tianyu demon sect was the closest to Dragon God Valley. Once he made a move, he would be able to reach Dragon God Valley very quickly.</p><p>In the Dragon God Valley, people were in a state of panic.</p><p>Yin Zheng even secretly sent people to sow discord. For a time, the people of Dragon God Valley were stirred up. The voices of handing over Lu Ming became louder and louder. If it weren’t for the valley master’s full suppression and the Ice Dragon patriarch’s personal appearance, the situation would have been better.</p><p>“One month later!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and returned to his cave abode to continue his closed-door cultivation.</p><p>it’s time to practice the chaos finger!</p><p>Lu Ming planned to start cultivating the divine power Technique.</p><p>&Nbsp; now, his chaos laws had a corresponding divine ability that he could cultivate.</p><p>However, the array Dao laws did not have the corresponding sacred art, so he could only look for it in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, meditating on the finger of calamity of chaos.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating a sacred art was astonishingly high. This could be seen from the fact that most of the bright Saints in the Azure continent had not succeeded in cultivating it.</p><p>In the Azure continent, only Supreme Saints were able to successfully cultivate it.</p><p>Moreover, the power of a divine ability varied greatly according to the temperature.</p><p>Mo Kong’s sacred art was only at 10% completion and he had just started.</p><p>Of course, for sacred art techniques, every 10% or even 5% difference in maturity would result in a huge difference in power. For example, 20% would be several times stronger than 10%.</p><p>If he cultivated it to 100%, its power would be earth-shattering.</p><p>However, many absolute Saints couldn’t cultivate a technique to 100% completion.</p><p>This was because cultivating divine powers was also a process of comprehending the laws.</p><p>Divine powers and laws complemented each other.</p><p>When cultivating a sacred art, it could increase one’s comprehension of the laws. The stronger one’s comprehension of the laws, the stronger the sacred art.</p><p>Cultivating divine powers could greatly speed up one’s comprehension of the laws.</p><p>If one cultivated a divine power to 100%, it meant that one had comprehended the law to its peak and had completely mastered it.</p><p>In this way, he could use a complete set of nomological laws as a Foundation to evolve a small world and attempt to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>From this, one could see how difficult it was to cultivate a divine power to 100%.</p><p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, another twenty days had passed. The day of the Alliance with the Tian Shen sect was getting closer and closer.</p><p>sigh, I still haven’t succeeded!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed under the path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>After more than 20 days, he still hadn’t succeeded in cultivating the primal Chaos tribulation finger. He hadn’t even reached the beginner level.</p><p>A remarkable power Technique was indeed difficult to cultivate. Furthermore, it was a remarkable power Technique that used the chaos laws as its Foundation. The difficulty of cultivating it was even more difficult. Of course, once it was successfully cultivated, its power would definitely be shocking.</p><p>I’m still too anxious. I’m too eager for quick success. The harder it is to succeed, the more I should relax!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a breath of turbid air and exited the mountain and river diagram. He planned to go out for a walk or give Xiangxiang some guidance on her cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled among the cloud Dragon Valley master. A cold wind blew, and Lu Ming’s anxious mood slowly calmed down.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He took out a voice transmission jade talisman and looked at it. It was Qiu Ying Ying who had sent him a voice transmission. She sounded very anxious as if something big had happened.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and headed towards the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Sure enough, at the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, he saw Qiu Ying Ying anxiously pacing back and forth.</p><p>“Yingying, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked directly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please save my big brother!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, tears welled up in Qiu Ying’s eyes as if she was about to cry.</p><p>“What’s wrong, brother Qiu?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>my big brother is now in the sunset Mountains. He’s being chased by Mo Yang of the Tian Yu demonic sect!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said anxiously.</p><p>“The sunset Mountains? You’re being chased by Mo Yang. Let’s go, we’ll talk as we walk!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Saint energy enveloped Qiu Ying Ying. He took Qiu Ying Ying into the air and flew out of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The luoxia mountain range was located in the middle of the Dragon God Valley and the Tianyu demon sect. However, it was closer to the Dragon God Valley. Lu Ming flew toward the luoxia mountain range at top speed.</p><p>On the way, Qiu Ying Ying explained the entire situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
