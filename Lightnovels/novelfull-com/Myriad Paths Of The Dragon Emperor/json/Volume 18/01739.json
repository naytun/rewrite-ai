Emperor Yun was killed and the cloud Emperor mountain collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. An Emperor-level force had been destroyed just like that. Even a Martial Emperor had been killed.</p><p>The yuan continent was too big and there were countless forces. This kind of thing probably happened everywhere.</p><p>Even if one cultivated to the rank of a martial Supreme, it was not guaranteed that one would be safe. There would always be someone stronger than one. Unless one had the combat strength to dominate the world, one might fall at any time.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stay any longer. He took a few glances and left the place, heading west.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Soon after, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>There was a group of people flying in front of them. There were about a dozen of them, and they were all wearing golden robes. They were filled with a noble aura, like emperors among people.</p><p>Lu Ming was very familiar with one of the young men.</p><p>Emperor Xian!</p><p>Back then, di Xian had brought people into the divine wilderness to help Di Yi. He wanted to kill Lu Ming, but in the end, most of his subordinates were killed by Lu Ming and he had to retreat in embarrassment.</p><p>He didn’t expect to Meet di Xian here.</p><p>After so many years, di Xian’s cultivation had already broken through the martial Royal realm and was now at Lv 5 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Among the dozen of people, there were two at the Saint realm and the rest were high-level martial Royal realm.</p><p>since we’ve met him, we should get rid of him and get rid of any future trouble. Otherwise, who knows when this guy will run to the divine wilderness continent to seek revenge!</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and walked towards the dozen di family members.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A Saint stage powerhouse looked at Lu Ming with a sharp gaze.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he slashed. A terrifying sword light flashed and the Saint was killed in one strike without any chance to fight back.</p><p>“Not good, quickly call for help!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat sword swept across the sky. Given these people’s combat strength, they could not stop Lu Ming at all. They were too far behind.</p><p>With a slash of the sword, almost all of them were killed. Only one person was still alive, and that was di Xian.</p><p>At this moment, di Xian was completely stunned. He stood in the air, his body trembling uncontrollably. He broke out in a cold sweat and looked at Lu Ming in horror.”Brother, let’s talk this out. Please spare my life. You are from the cloud Emperor mountain, right? please leave. I will never tell anyone about this!”</p><p>“I’m not from the cloud Emperor mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Not from the cloud Emperor mountain?”</p><p>Di Xian was stunned for a moment. He thought that it was the missing fish from the cloud Emperor mountain who had come back for revenge. It turned out that he was not from the cloud Emperor mountain.</p><p>“You’re so fast. Don’t you remember me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and his appearance returned to normal.</p><p>“It’s … It’s you?”</p><p>Di Xian’s pupils constricted as he recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>He had not expected that before he could go to the divine wilderness continent to look for Lu Ming, Lu Ming had already arrived. Furthermore, his combat strength was so terrifying that even a Saint could not take a single blow from him.</p><p>His original plan was to seek revenge on Lu Ming in the divine wilderness after he had broken through to the martial Royal realm. However, many things had happened in the DI family and he had many things to do. At this point in time, he did not go to the divine wilderness. He stayed in the DI family to make a name for himself. When the situation had stabilized, he would go to the divine wilderness to exterminate Lu Ming.</p><p>He did not expect to meet Lu Ming here.</p><p>He turned around and ran.</p><p>However, Lu Ming slashed with his sword. Di Xian was dead!</p><p>After killing di Xian, Lu Ming felt more relaxed. He could now go to ancient Moon sanctuary in peace.</p><p>After changing his appearance, Lu Ming left the place at top speed and headed west.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming left, the murder of di Xian and the others was discovered. The DI family sent out a large number of experts to search for the murderer, but unfortunately, they could not find the murderer in the end.</p><p>Lu Ming headed all the way to the West. He passed through the clouds Plains and entered a vast mountain range.</p><p>This was the cloud Sea Mountain range.</p><p>The cloud ocean mountain range was filled with ancient trees and countless dangerous peaks. There were countless beasts living there, even quite a few absolute Saint beasts.</p><p>Lu Ming was careful. He slowed down and walked through the mountain range of the sea of clouds. He cultivated as he hurried along.</p><p>After walking for two whole months, Lu Ming finally passed through the boundless sea of clouds and mountains and entered a place where humans gathered-Feng province!</p><p>Feng province also had an Emperor-level powerhouse guarding it, and he was called Emperor Feng.</p><p>After arriving at Feng province, he finally did not have to travel carefully. Lu Ming took out the space-breaking flying shuttle that was five times faster, entered it, and flew away.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was to rush to the ancient Moon sanctuary and see if he could ask the powerful forces of the ancient Moon sanctuary to take action and annihilate evil spirit cult.</p><p>Ordinary Emperor-level forces were useless. For example, the cloud Emperor mountain had been destroyed.</p><p>After Lu Ming entered the space-breaking flying shuttle, he continued to cultivate.</p><p>During the two months in the cloud Sea Mountain range, Lu Ming’s main focus was to cultivate the chaotic finger of tribulation. After such a long period of cultivation, Lu Ming had finally successfully comprehended the chaotic finger of tribulation.</p><p>Of course, it was only 10%, but its power was still terrifying.</p><p>The primal Chaos tribulation finger was a supernormal technique that used the primal Chaos laws as the foundation. Even if it was only a tenth of its power, it would still far surpass ordinary supernormal techniques.</p><p>The finger of chaos tribulation had become Lu Ming’s strongest killing move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was also steadily improving, slowly approaching the mastery of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated in peace in the space-breaking flying shuttle.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had already crossed six big states and passed by six Emperor-level forces. However, he was still very far from ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>“There are so many Emperor-level forces scattered all over this land. Then, with ancient Moon Holy Land as the center, how many Emperor-level forces are there in the territory that stretches out? Each of these Emperor-ranked powers has at least one emperor-ranked powerhouse in charge. How many Emperor-ranked powerhouses are there?”</p><p>also, there are nine sacred lands in Mount Yuan. How many Emperor level powers are there? not to mention that there are ten lands in the yuan continent. How many experts and Emperor level experts are there? I’m afraid it’s hard to count!</p><p>then why did I hear that evil spirit had harmed the yuan continent and was annihilated by countless forces? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind. He was very curious.</p><p>It was said that evil spirit had a leader, two vice leaders, and thirty-six Guardian Kings, all of whom were Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Such a force was indeed terrifying and incomparably terrifying. However, in the vast Yuan continent, it should not be considered much, right?</p><p>In the vast Yuan continent, with so many monarch-level forces and so many monarch-level experts working together, they could easily destroy evil spirit cult, right?</p><p>perhaps because the Azure region is remote, most people don’t have enough knowledge and think that evil spirit is the most terrifying power in the yuan continent!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
