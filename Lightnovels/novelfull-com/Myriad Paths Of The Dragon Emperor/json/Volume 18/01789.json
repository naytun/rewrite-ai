His body couldn’t take it anymore. He had to at least break through to the Supreme Saint realm or evolve his spirit body again.</p><p>However, he should be able to seal a few more great saint weapons. This way, he would be able to increase his strength.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming sealed another six great saint weapons. The number of great saint weapons he had sealed increased to 12, which was the same as Wan Pingyang’s.</p><p>After cultivating the ten thousand soldiers scroll, Lu Ming continued to study the chaos finger tribulation and the sealed scroll of the nine scrolls of array Dao.</p><p>Time flew by, and another two months passed.</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation had entered a period of steady improvement and was slowly approaching the great sage realm.</p><p>And during this period of time, Gu Yue Holy Land entered a period of peace.</p><p>Many of the heaven’s favorites from the heavenly Emperor City had returned. However, they were all actively preparing for the battle. They worked hard to cultivate and wait for the opening of the yuan mountain sacred Institute.</p><p>The few emperors would establish the yuan mountain Saint Academy. At that time, all the geniuses of the yuan mountain would definitely gather in the heavenly Emperor City. The heavenly Emperor City would become a place for the geniuses to fight for supremacy. If one’s cultivation and combat strength were not enough, they would only become a stepping stone for others.</p><p>Therefore, all of them were cultivating hard.</p><p>On this day, Huang Ling and Long Chen came together to ask Lu Ming to go to the ten thousand spirit trade city with them.</p><p>The ten thousand spirit trading city was very famous in the ancient Moon Holy Land. It was founded by a few powerful forces, and one of them was the WAN family.</p><p>Within the ten thousand spirit trade city, there were many shops. All kinds of treasures and rare items could be seen. After many years of development, it had become extremely prosperous. It had become the two largest Trading Places in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Every day, it was packed with people.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally curious about such a place and he agreed readily. He wanted to take a look and see if he could buy some useful items.</p><p>He also wanted to sell some of the useless things he had on him in exchange for raw gemstones.</p><p>Lu Ming brought bubbles with him and the group of them flew in the air. Not long after, a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>This city was very large, and one could see people coming out of the city continuously, and people going in and out continuously.</p><p>They landed at the city gate, which was guarded. If they wanted to enter the city, they had to pay a certain amount of raw stones.</p><p>The few of them paid the fees and walked into the city.</p><p>As soon as they entered the city, all they could see were shops. There were all kinds of shops, and there was no end to them.</p><p>those forces that founded the trade city are really making a fortune. There’s a fee to enter the city, and there’s a fee to rent out these shops. How many raw gemstones do they earn every year?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>No wonder the WAN family was so rich. Every disciple had a large number of Saint weapons to cultivate the ten thousand soldier scroll.</p><p>The WAN family had developed for countless years and had many disciples. With so many people cultivating the ten thousand soldiers scroll, the number of holy weapons they needed was a terrifying number.</p><p>This was nothing, especially for the monarch-level experts. They needed monarch weapons for their cultivation, which was even more expensive. Without income, they couldn’t afford to cultivate at all.</p><p>The few of them walked around the streets, looking for the things they needed.</p><p>Lu Ming had also entered a few shops and exchanged all his useless items for high-grade raw gemstones.</p><p>When one reached the Saint realm, one would almost always use superior-grade raw stones for cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming only kept a small amount of the bright Saint weapon on him. He sold most of it in exchange for a lot of spiritual liquid to water the path-understanding ancient tree. He also bought some spiritual herbs for Paisha to eat.</p><p>Suddenly, they saw many people gathering in one direction. A few of them were curious and followed them. They found many people rushing into a Hall.</p><p>“Brother, why are there so many people running here?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stopped a young man and asked.</p><p>“This Hall is a place to sell slaves. There are all kinds of slaves, human race and demon race. 1 just heard that they are selling a true dragon, a peerless beauty. This is extremely rare. Brother, 1 have to go, or it will be too late!”</p><p>The young man said as he hurried forward.</p><p>“True dragon? A beauty?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Long Chen and Feng Ling. Then, the three of them walked toward the main hall.</p><p>The main hall was very wide, but it was already filled with people. The three of them squeezed through the crowd and looked ahead.</p><p>At the very front of the hall, there was a high platform, which was the place where the slaves were sold. At this moment, an extremely beautiful woman was sitting on the high platform. This woman’s neck, wrists, and ankles were all wearing something that looked like a collar. There were runes shining on it, which clearly could seal one’s cultivation.</p><p>The woman looked Haggard and her aura was weak. Her snow-white dress was torn in many places, revealing many wounds that seemed to have been caused by the leather whip.</p><p>It could be seen that he had definitely been tortured.</p><p>Although she was injured and her aura was weak, it was still difficult to hide her beautiful figure and appearance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind buzzed at the sight of this woman. A cold and terrifying killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>“Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was extremely terrifying. It surged in all directions like a tide.</p><p>The woman on the platform was Lu Ming’s Senior Sister, Xue ningxin.</p><p>In the surroundings, the others felt a chill all over their bodies and couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s wrong?”</p><p>At the side, Huang Ling was surprised. Why did Lu Ming suddenly burst out with such a terrifying killing intent?</p><p>“The one on the high platform is my Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in a low voice, his eyes emitting a terrifying ominous glint.</p><p>“Your Senior Sister?”</p><p>‘Phoenix spirit.’ Long Chen’s heart skipped a beat. Fie finally understood why Lu Ming had such a murderous intent.</p><p>At that moment, on the high platform, beside Xue ningxin, two elders had also noticed Lu Ming’s abnormality. A shocking aura erupted from their bodies. It was the aura of a great saint.</p><p>thousand spirit exchange, whoever causes trouble will be killed!</p><p>Ail old man coldly said.</p><p>Moreover, there were terrifying auras around the hall. There were many powerful auras that made one’s heart tremble.</p><p>This place was jointly established by the WAN family, the heavenly Bird Palace, and the heavenly Wolf tower, so they naturally sent many experts to guard it.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be rash. The four major forces have sent many experts here!”</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He suppressed the killing intent in his heart and his body.</p><p>On the high platform, Xue ningxin seemed to have sensed Lu Ming’s killing intent as well. She raised her head and looked over. When she saw Lu Ming, surprise and hope flashed in her eyes. However, the light soon dimmed and she shook her head at Lu Ming.</p><p>What she meant was for Lu Ming to leave and not save her.</p><p>Senior Sister, don’t worry. I’ll save you!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xue ningxin. His voice was firm and unquestionable.</p><p>Xue ningxin continued to shake her head. The forces here were too powerful. They were many times stronger than the so-called top forces in the Azure region. She did not wish for Lu Ming to offend these powerful forces in order to save her.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was firm and unquestionable. He had to save Xue ningxin.. Whoever stopped him would die!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
