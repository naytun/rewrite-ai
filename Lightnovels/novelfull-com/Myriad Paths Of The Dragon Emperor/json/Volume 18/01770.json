Everyone’s aura was rising rapidly.</p><p>Of course, the faster the speed, the more benefits the person at the front would get.</p><p>Half a month later, the aura on Lu Ming’s body swelled. He had broken through to the next realm.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming was originally a perfected bright Saint. Now, he had broken through to the peak of the bright Saint realm.</p><p>It had only been half a month and Lu Ming’s cultivation had broken through. The speed was shocking.</p><p>At this moment, there were only a few people who could travel together with Lu Ming.</p><p>The Prodigy of the Thunder clan with the chaotic body and The Prodigy with the death law.</p><p>There were a few other heaven’s favorites who were also very terrifying. They were at the forefront with Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>A month later, Lu Ming’s speed increased again and he surpassed the others in one fell swoop, taking the lead.</p><p>Of course, none of them knew about this. Everyone was fully focused on comprehending and cultivating.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ming was in the lead, he had not been overtaken. Furthermore, the gap between him and the people behind him was slowly widening.</p><p>One and a half months after they cultivated and comprehended, Lu Ming’s cultivation had another breakthrough and he had entered the great circle of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>In a short one and a half months, Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced by two levels. The effect was shocking.</p><p>As a human, this was related to Lu Ming’s low cultivation level.</p><p>The lower one’s cultivation was, the faster one would break through. The higher one’s cultivation was, the more difficult it would be to break through.</p><p>It would be much more difficult to break through to the Supreme Saint realm or even the absolute Saint realm than a bright Saint.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation base was at the great saint or the absolute Saint realm, it would not be so easy to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s stone platform was getting closer and closer to the other side of the abyss.</p><p>After another half a month, Lu Ming’s stone platform finally reached the other side of the abyss. At this moment, the sound of the great Dao in the sky disappeared completely.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>The white-robed elder’s voice was like a morning bell that rang in everyone’s hearts. Everyone woke up from their state of enlightenment.</p><p>“Has it ended?”</p><p>Someone murmured, somewhat reluctant to leave.</p><p>In that state of enlightenment, it was too good. Not only the laws, but also the cultivation of the martial path were advancing by leaps and bounds. It was comparable to years of bitter cultivation.</p><p>my cultivation base has broken through!</p><p>“I’ve also made a breakthrough in my nomological laws!”</p><p>Excited voices could be heard. Everyone was the same. The first thing they felt when they woke up was the change in their bodies.</p><p>“My cultivation has reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Moreover, he was not far from the great saint realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” the chaos tribulation finger has also reached fifty percent completion!</p><p>What made Lu Ming even more delighted was that the chaos finger of tribulation had also improved by leaps and bounds. It had reached fifty percent completion.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation level was, the harder it would be to cultivate a sacred art, and the time it would take would also increase exponentially.</p><p>To be able to go from forty percent to fifty percent was already very fast. Moreover, he cultivated the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>After sensing the changes in his body, Lu Ming looked at the others.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>He found that his platform was in the first place, and behind it was the child of death, the chaotic body.</p><p>Behind them were a few others, followed by Long Chen, Feng Ling, and bubbles.</p><p>While Lu Ming was sizing up the others, the others were also sizing up the others. However, almost at the same time, everyone looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was because Lu Ming was far ahead and had reached the other side. He was too eye-catching.</p><p>“It’s him, the son of chaos! He’s actually in the lead, surpassing the chaotic body and the Son of death!”</p><p>how shocking! I didn’t expect him to get first place!</p><p>ah, I’m finished! I’m below the 100th place!</p><p>Above the abyss, a series of voices rang out.</p><p>Everyone’s ranking was clear at a glance. Many people found themselves below the 100th place and couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>There were even people who realized that their rankings were at the bottom, and their expressions became even uglier.</p><p>If he was ranked last, didn’t that mean that his comprehension and potential were the worst?</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, you’re so amazing! Chirp chirp!”</p><p>Bubbles cried out in excitement, almost dancing with joy.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and looked at the chaotic body, only to see that his gaze was as sharp as a sword and extremely cold.</p><p>“Now, who is more qualified to master the Laws of Chaos?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>The chaotic body’s face darkened even more when he heard this.</p><p>Previously, he had repeatedly said that Lu Ming was not qualified to master the Laws of Chaos and that he was the only one in the world who could master the Laws of Chaos. He was so arrogant and insufferably arrogant.</p><p>But now, he was being suppressed by Lu Ming. Lu Ming led the group and was the first to reach the other side.</p><p>Lu Ming was not qualified. Who was?</p><p>Hmph, it’s just a competition of comprehension. It doesn’t mean anything. Moreover, the time is short. If we continue to compete, I’ll definitely surpass you!</p><p>The chaotic body coldly said.</p><p>“Hehe, a loss is a loss, but you’re lying to yourself here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in disdain.</p><p>The chaotic body’s eyes glowed even more sharply, as if his gaze was going to turn into a sharp sword that could pierce through Lu Ming. However, Lu Ming was not afraid at all. He looked straight at him and confronted him head on.</p><p>The son of death did not say anything. He only looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>pass the test, your gains will be equally huge. Go!</p><p>alright, now the top 100 have come out. I’ll send you back for those below the 100th!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>Many people sighed, feeling somewhat unwilling.</p><p>The white-robed old man waved his hand and a large number of light pillars appeared, enveloping the figures. Then, the figures disappeared in the light pillars.</p><p>There were only a hundred people left.</p><p>The stone platforms that had not reached the other side also flew forward and leaned on the other side.</p><p>alright, you guys can continue moving forward. There’s still a test waiting for you ahead. If you can pass the test, your gains will be equally huge. Go!</p><p>The white-robed old man’s voice rang out, and then his figure disappeared.</p><p>Everyone flew up and set foot on the other side of the abyss.</p><p>The chaotic body exuded a powerful aura. He looked at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze.</p><p>If he could make a move here, he would not hesitate to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked at the other party coldly.</p><p>With a sneer, the chaotic body rose into the air and flew forward. The others did the same, flying forward one after another.</p><p>Not long after, a towering mountain appeared in front of them. On the mountain, there was an extremely huge Palace.</p><p>As the group got closer, they discovered that there was a huge stone tablet at the foot of the mountain. On the stone tablet, there were three big words: Hunyuan sect!</p><p>Everyone’s hearts turned solemn. They had arrived at Hunyuan sect.</p><p>Behind the stone tablet, there was a flight of stairs that stretched on for an unknown length. No one knew how many steps there were.</p><p>At this moment, the white-robed old man appeared again and said, ” this is the main gate of the Hunyuan sect. If you want to go up, you must go up the stairs step by step. This is a sign of respect for the Hunyuan sect. If anyone disrespects you, I will send him back. You can go up!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
