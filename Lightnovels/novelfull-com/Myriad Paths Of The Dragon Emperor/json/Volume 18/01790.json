It’s extremely beautiful and rare even among the true dragons. If you’re interested, you can buy it and play with it. Now, the bidding for this true dragon will start. The highest bidder will get it. The starting price is 100000 upper-grade raw stones!</p><p>The old man’s words caused many people’s eyes to shine with a strange light.</p><p>real Dragons are rare, and it’s a Snow Dragon. Such a beautiful snow Dragon is even rarer. It must be very exciting to buy one and play with it!</p><p>hehe, I’ve never played with a true dragon before. I don’t know what it feels like. This true dragon is mine!</p><p>“In your dreams, it’s mine!”</p><p>…..</p><p>At the scene, there was a burst of noise, and many people stared at Xue ningxin with fiery eyes.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes were filled with despair, while Lu Ming’s killing intent was even stronger.</p><p>“I’ll bid one hundred and fifty thousand superior-grade raw stones!”</p><p>“I bid 160000!”</p><p>“Two hundred thousand!”</p><p>The crowd began to bid, and the price kept rising. Soon, it reached a high price of three hundred thousand.</p><p>300,000 superior-grade raw stones for a half-Saint true dragon was a shockingly high price.</p><p>One superior-grade raw stone was equivalent to ten thousand medium-grade raw stones.</p><p>Three hundred thousand superior-grade raw stones would be three billion medium-grade raw stones.</p><p>“Four hundred thousand!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard and he raised the price by one hundred thousand to four hundred thousand.</p><p>The sudden increase of 100000 made many people shake their heads. This price was too high. It was not worth it to buy a half-Saint true dragon.</p><p>“Four hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. A young man with an evil expression looked at Lu Ming and said,”Brat, you want to compete with me? let’s see how much wealth you have!” “Five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and called out five hundred thousand.</p><p>“Five hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>The devilish-looking young man added another 50000.</p><p>On the side, the others gasped. 550000 was already an extremely shocking price. At this point, most people had given up on bidding and shook their heads in pity.</p><p>“Six hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to increase the bid.</p><p>“Six hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>The devilish-looking teenager raised the price again, but one could see that he was also in pain. Six hundred and fifty thousand was already an extremely shocking price. This was a high-grade raw gemstone, not a medium-grade raw gemstone.</p><p>“Feng Ling, Long Chen, lend me some raw gemstones later!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a message to Huang Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>“No problem!”</p><p>“I’ll give you as much as you want!”</p><p>Phoenix spirit and Long Chen spoke one after another.</p><p>“One million!”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming raised the price to one million Yuan.</p><p>To him, as long as he could save Xue ningxin, it did not matter how many raw stones he had to spend.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss…</p><p>Gasps could be heard all around. Lu Ming had actually increased the price to one million.</p><p>“Who is this person? He’s so rich to be willing to pay a million superior-grade raw stones for a female true dragon!”</p><p>1 know him. He’s Lu Ming. 1 didn’t expect him to be such a lecherous person. With a beauty like Feng Ling beside him, he even spent a huge sum of money to buy this true dragon. His taste is extraordinary!</p><p>“Young man, you’re full of energy!”</p><p>The crowd discussed, and some elders even sighed.</p><p>“These people, what nonsense are they spouting?” Huang Ling’s face blushed.</p><p>It was not just the others who were shocked. When Lu Ming called out a million, the devilish-looking young man’s expression changed as well. He looked like he was struggling. In the end, he looked at Xue ningxin with a burning gaze and finally shook his head, clearly giving up on bidding.</p><p>A million superior-grade raw stones was too high.</p><p>one million! Is there anyone who wants to bid higher? this is a Snow Dragon, and it’s rare even among the true dragon clan. It’ll definitely be a different experience if you buy it. Normally, there’s no place to buy it!</p><p>On the high platform, an old man spoke, hoping to incite the crowd to continue bidding.</p><p>However, although many people’s eyes were burning, they still shook their heads.</p><p>A million superior-grade raw stones was too high.</p><p>one million! Is there a higher bid?”</p><p>The old man continued.</p><p>After that, the old man called out three times in a row, but no one responded.</p><p>“Alright, since no one is bidding, this Snow Dragon will go to…”</p><p>The old man was about to announce it, but before he could finish, he was interrupted by another voice.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I’ll bid 1.1 million!”</p><p>A voice rang out from behind the high platform.</p><p>Behind the platform, there were some rooms. Then, a group of young men walked out.</p><p>“Wan Pingyang, Wan tianbing…”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room, emitting a cold light.</p><p>There were more than ten people in the group of young men. Lu Ming recognized a few of them.</p><p>They were Wan Pingyang, Wan tianbing, and Wan Tianlong.</p><p>Lu Ming also knew Xu tuo from the Sirius tower and young master Tianying from the celestial Bird Palace, but he didn’t know anyone else.</p><p>The one who had just made a bid was Wan Pingyang.</p><p>“Young masters, why have you come?”</p><p>On the high platform, the old man bowed to Wan Pingyang and the others.</p><p>there’s a rare Snow Dragon being auctioned here. We’re very interested in it, so we came to take a look!</p><p>Wan Pingyang then looked at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming, these young men are the prodigies who founded the four great forces of the thousand spirit exchange!</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. His eyes were cold as he glanced at Wan Pingyang. “One million two hundred thousand!”</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be so interested in this Snow Dragon. But I’m interested too. One million and three hundred thousand!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang laughed and raised the price again.</p><p>“One million five hundred thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not even blink and added another two hundred thousand.</p><p>“160!”</p><p>“Two million!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming even called out two million directly, making the entire venue quiet down.</p><p>Wan Pingyang was slightly taken aback as well, but he did not continue bidding. His gaze swept across Lu Ming, then landed on Xue ningxin. An idea struck him, and he smiled.”! understand. Lu Ming, you know this Snow Dragon, right? no wonder you raised the price to such a high level!”</p><p>…..</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything. He only looked at Wan Pingyang coldly.</p><p>Wan Pingyang’s lips curled into a cold smile. “In that case, we won’t sell this Snow Dragon!”</p><p>“You … What did he say?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a terrifying light as he stared at Wan Pingyang.</p><p>“Are you deaf? I’m telling you, we re not selling this Snow Dragon. The ten thousand spirit trading house was founded by the four of us, and it’s up to me to decide if we re selling it or not!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang sneered, a rare Snow Dragon, and it’s so beautiful. To be honest, I’ve never played with it before. I plan to keep it for myself!</p><p>“Brother Wan, you can’t enjoy it alone!”</p><p>Xu tuo said, his eyes burning with passion.</p><p>hahaha, of course not. We re all brothers. Whoever sees it will have a share!</p><p>Wan Pingyang laughed. He was obviously saying it for Lu Ming to hear.</p><p>The killing intent on Lu Ming’s body grew stronger.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was angry, Wan Pingyang, Wan tianbing, and the rest felt even better. They felt the thrill of revenge.</p><p>So what if Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong? This was their territory.. What could Lu Ming do?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
