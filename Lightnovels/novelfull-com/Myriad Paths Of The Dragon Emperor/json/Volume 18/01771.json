Lu Ming and the other three followed suit.</p><p>There was nothing unusual about the stairs. It was just like any other ordinary stairs. To everyone, it was like flat ground. If they used their movement techniques, they would be able to reach the top in a few steps.</p><p>...</p><p>However, everyone remembered the words of the white-robed old man. They had to go up step by step, or they would be eliminated.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest walked up the stairs at a steady pace. However, this flight of stairs was really very high. There were at least more than a hundred thousand of them. They had been walking for a few hours and had only crossed a small section.</p><p>“Hmph, why do I need to take these ordinary steps one by one?”</p><p>At this time, a young man snorted coldly, appearing to be a little impatient. Then, he took a step forward and crossed over 10000 steps in an instant, leading far ahead of the others.</p><p>“You idiots, crawl slowly. This young master will take a step first!”</p><p>The young man’s face was filled with joy, and he looked at the others with disdain. Then, he took another step and crossed over 10000 steps.</p><p>But this time, before he could celebrate, a pillar of light suddenly appeared and enveloped him.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>The man shouted. The next moment, his figure disappeared as he was teleported out.</p><p>“You think you’re smart, but you’re clearly the fool!”</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>Following that, everyone naturally didn’t dare to copy that young man. They all climbed up step by step.</p><p>An ordinary person might not even be able to finish climbing the 100000 steps in half a month. However, it wasn’t too difficult for them.</p><p>After a little more than a day, they had reached the top of the mountain.</p><p>At the top of the mountain, there were many majestic palaces. It was difficult to see the end of them.</p><p>They appeared on a vast land, and in front of them was the door of a Palace. At this time, the door was open.</p><p>Everyone muttered to themselves for a moment before they stepped into the palace. They followed a passageway and finally arrived at a strange place.</p><p>The first thing that came into view was a few hundred stone pillars. On top of the stone pillars, there was a strange fluctuation.</p><p>In front of the stone pillar, there was a huge fighting ring.</p><p>At this moment, the white-robed old man appeared again.</p><p>“Didn’t you all want to fight? Now, I’ll give you a chance to fight!”</p><p>The white-robed old man’s voice rang out.</p><p>His words made many people’s eyes burst out with a bright light.</p><p>The chaotic body, in particular, looked at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze and a sinister smile.</p><p>“Now, let’s see how you die.”</p><p>The chaotic body muttered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression was calm.</p><p>He didn’t believe that they could just fight directly without any restrictions. If that was the case, then those with weaker cultivation bases wouldn’t even need to compete and could just go back.</p><p>No one in the bright Saint realm could fight a Saint, not to mention that the opponent was a rare genius.</p><p>As expected, the white-robed old man’s voice sounded again, ” however, this battle needs to be fair. I will seal your true essence and seal your cultivation at the initial bright Saint realm. you will use the secret skill on the stone pillar to fight!”</p><p>Furthermore, the strength of your Saint power will be the same!</p><p>in addition, I’ll seal all your laws, divine powers, martial techniques, and spirit bodies so that all of you will be at the same level!</p><p>Many people’s faces changed. According to the white-robed old man, almost all of his methods were sealed, and the Saint power was the same. How could they compete?</p><p>“Do you guys see those stone pillars? There is a secret skill on each stone pillar. Later, you can choose a stone pillar and comprehend the secret skill on it. I will give you half a month. After half a month, you will use the secret skill on the stone pillar to fight!”</p><p>The white-robed man continued to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. As expected, this was the fairest way. Everyone would be sealed at the same level and they would have to rely on the secret skill that they had learned from the stone pillar to fight the enemy.</p><p>The harvest of this half a month directly determined one’s combat strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the white-robed old man’s body emitted a strange fluctuation. Then, a wave of power surged into everyone’s body. This power was high and mighty, and they could not resist it. It sealed everything about them.</p><p>“My Saint energy is really only left with the Saint energy of a lower tier bright Saint!”</p><p>also, I can’t use laws. I can’t use divine powers or martial techniques!</p><p>my spiritual body is only equivalent to a low-tier heaven spiritual body!</p><p>Voices rang out one after another. Everyone realized that they had really been sealed. Other than the Saint power of a lower tier bright Saint, they could not use anything else.</p><p>only one of my Saint hearts can work!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. This white-robed old man was definitely an unimaginable existence. Although it was only a projection, it was hard to predict his means.</p><p>Then, the old man waved his hand, and all kinds of auras burst out from the stone pillars.</p><p>There was a soaring sword intent, a bright blade light, the aura of a fist technique, the aura of a palm technique …</p><p>There were all kinds of them.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In such a competition, it was very particular what kind of secret skill to choose.</p><p>By choosing a secret skill that he was familiar with, he would naturally be able to comprehend it faster. Only then would he be able to gain the upper hand in the battle half a month later.</p><p>This battle would mainly test two aspects.</p><p>The first aspect was naturally the comprehension he had gained in the past half a month.</p><p>The second aspect was the individual’s battle awareness. The stronger one’s battle awareness was, the more likely one would be able to win against someone of the same cultivation level.</p><p>don’t worry, you can comprehend it up there. No one will disturb you!</p><p>The white-robed old man added, telling everyone to relax and not worry about being attacked by others in the process of comprehending.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young man leaped onto a stone platform that was filled with sword intent and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>“That stone platform is mine!”</p><p>Then, another person jumped onto a stone platform that was filled with the aura of a saber technique.</p><p>Of course, there was more than one stone platform that was filled with sword intent or saber aura. Some of them were repeated.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three leaped onto the stone platform one after another in search of suitable secret skills.</p><p>Lu Ming leaped onto a stone platform that was filled with a terrifying Spear’s consciousness. Since he started cultivating, he had spent the longest time cultivating the spear and had the deepest understanding of the spear. He would benefit the most if he chose a stone platform filled with the Spear’s consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming sat down cross-legged immediately. The stone platform glowed and a light screen enveloped him. No one could disturb him.</p><p>It was the Coiling Dragon Spear!</p><p>After Lu Ming closed his eyes, a voice rang in his mind. Then, his surroundings changed. Lu Ming seemed to have arrived at a vast land. In the sky, there was a figure dancing. The long spear in his hand danced like a real Dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming began to read it carefully.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ming seemed to have made some progress. He condensed a long spear in his hand and began to practice.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The long spear was brandished like a real Dragon circling around. The strong wind whistled, and the power was astonishing.</p><p>After cultivating for a while, Lu Ming stopped and continued to observe the figure in the sky.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming immersed himself in a deep level of cultivation. Time passed quickly and Lu Ming’s understanding of the Coiling Dragon Spear became deeper and deeper.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
