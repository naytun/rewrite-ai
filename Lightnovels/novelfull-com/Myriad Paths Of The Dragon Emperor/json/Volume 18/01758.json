This made many people very curious. Who was so bold to challenge two geniuses at the same time? how strong was this person?</p><p>Many young sovereigns and even many older figures were very curious. They gathered around the Phoenix Lake, waiting for the battle to begin.</p><p>“The people from Phoenix Palace are here!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Many people looked in the direction of the Phoenix Palace and saw a group of people walking in the Air.</p><p>Most of them were young people, but there were also some older figures who had deep auras.</p><p>“Which one of you is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>the black-robed young man standing beside Huang Ling is Lu Ming!</p><p>Oh, it seems that his cultivation base is not very deep, only in the great achievement of the sacred brightness realm. He actually dared to fight the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing. He is really bold!</p><p>Someone said. There were elders here with extremely high cultivation. There were even Emperor-to-be figures. Although Lu Ming had used the illusionary breath technique to hide his cultivation, the difference in cultivation was too great and he would still be seen through.</p><p>“What? Only at the great mastery of the bright Saint stage?”</p><p>that’s right. But I heard rumors that Lu Ming is very likely to be the son of chaos!</p><p>“What? The son of chaos? Really? the son of chaos, one of the sons of heaven?”</p><p>it’s very likely to be true. Otherwise, how could he have cultivated the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art? however, even if he’s the son of chaos or the other sons of God, they only represent potential. Before they have grown up, they will still be killed by others!</p><p>The moment Lu Ming and the rest arrived, it caused a heated discussion.</p><p>It could be seen that during this period of time, the battle was very popular. There were various rumors about Lu Ming’s identity.</p><p>Lu Ming, all the best! I believe that you will definitely win!</p><p>Huang Ling cheered Lu Ming on.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and descended from the sky. He landed on Phoenix Lake and stood on the surface of the lake, waiting quietly.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the sky in the distance was illuminated by bolts of lightning. The bolts of lightning seemed to split the sky into pieces. Then, when the lightning disappeared, there was a group of people on Phoenix Lake.</p><p>“The people of the Thunder God sect have arrived!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>The Thunder God sect was a powerful force in the ancient Moon Holy Land, and there were also experts who came to watch.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope that you will win this battle!”</p><p>A young man in the Thunder God sect said. His voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>“Brother ye, after I win, you and I will go and have a drink!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>The young man who had just spoken was ye Dongfang.</p><p>This attracted the attention of many people. Lu Ming was also familiar with The Prodigy of the Thunder God sect?</p><p>“You’re delusional. You have no chance of winning!”</p><p>A cold voice sounded, and a group of people with noble auras stepped through the air.</p><p>The experts of the WAN family had arrived.</p><p>There were many people from the WAN family. There were young geniuses and also figures from the older generation. They were all experts.</p><p>Among them, Wan tianbing stepped down from the sky and landed on the lake, standing opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming, I could have killed you by myself, but you’re just asking for it. You want to fight me and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow. I’ll let you die in peace!</p><p>Wan tianbing sneered.</p><p>“Strength is not something that can be said with words!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the sky rumbled as if a giant beast was trampling on the void.</p><p>In fact, that was the case.</p><p>Nine 100-meter-tall statues with Jade-like bodies pulled a huge chariot, crushing the void.</p><p>OWW …</p><p>Nine 100-meter-tall giant statues stopped not far away, giving people a strong visual impact.</p><p>the people of the divine elephant sect have also come!</p><p>Someone said with a serious expression.</p><p>There were many powerful forces in ancient Moon Holy Land, but there were also strong and weak ones. Divine elephant sect was an extremely powerful force.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also shifted to the chariot.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, Long Chen had been rescued by a terrifying expert of the divine elephant sect.</p><p>At this moment, a group of people stepped out of the chariot. There were not many of them, only a dozen or so.</p><p>The person in the lead was a young man with an ordinary appearance, but his eyes were like lightning, and he had a domineering aura.</p><p>“Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He did not expect to see Long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes swept across the room and he smiled when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, long time no see!”</p><p>Said Long Chen. His voice was deep, but there was a hint of excitement in it.</p><p>He and Lu Ming both came from the divine wilderness continent. Now that they were far away in a foreign land, it was inevitable that they would be excited to reunite with old friends.</p><p>it’s been a long time indeed. Long Chen, we’ll catch up after this battle!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Long Chen nodded and led the people of the divine elephant sect to the side.</p><p>Did Lu Ming know the people from the divine elephant sect?</p><p>Many people were shocked. Lu Ming knew quite a lot of people.</p><p>At this moment, a sword light broke through the sky. The experts from the wilderness sword sect had arrived. Then, the experts from the celestial Bird Palace and the earth sect also arrived.</p><p>All of them were powerful forces from the Holy Lands.</p><p>Most of the powerful forces had probably come because they had heard the rumors about the son of chaos.</p><p>Gah! Gah!</p><p>At this moment, ear-piercing cries were heard. In the distance, dozens of golden rays of light shot towards them. They were dozens of three-legged golden crows.</p><p>The Golden Crow clan had arrived.</p><p>Dozens of three-legged golden crows hovered in the sky above Phoenix Lake. Their bodies were covered in Golden Solar Fire, and it was as if dozens of Suns had appeared in the sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One of the three-legged golden crows flapped its wings and landed on the Phoenix Lake. It stood side by side with the celestial soldiers and stared at Lu Ming with its golden eyes that glowed coldly.</p><p>It was the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow!</p><p>“Wan tianbing, leave this guy to me!”</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden crow’s cold and arrogant voice sounded.</p><p>“Leave it to you?”</p><p>Wan tianbing’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“That’s right. I can kill Lu Ming alone!”</p><p>The voice of the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow was heard. Then, he flapped his wings and flew toward Lu Ming like a golden ray of light. The wings flapped and the divine Helios fire cut through the void like a blade, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step on the surface of the lake and charged toward the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow like a bolt of lightning. His palm was like a blade as he slashed out. Instantly, the flaming blades shattered. Lu Ming’s palm did not stop and collided with the wings of the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It was as if two Giant Mountains had collided, creating a terrible shock. The powerful force immediately caused thousands of waves in Phoenix Lake.</p><p>“Kill! Great sun, destroy the world!”</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow shouted. The fire of the great sun burned all over his body, and even the space was distorted. His body shrank into a ball, as if he had really turned into a sun, and he smashed it toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s chaos laws circulated all over his body as he used the prison-suppressing heavenly art. He turned his palm into a fist and punched out continuously.</p><p>Each punch seemed to have a prison-suppressing stele.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
