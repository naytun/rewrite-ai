For a time, many responded.</p><p>The heavenly God sect, jiuxiao sword sect, and the evil moon sect responded one after another, joining the Alliance Army to fight against evil spirit.</p><p>After that, the heaven King Palace, Linglong Palace, and poyuan family, who had always been neutral, also joined the Alliance.</p><p>At this point, the nine great sects of the Azure continent had joined forces, and with the addition of other small and medium-sized powers, their strength was immense.</p><p>During this period, the various sects had continuously sent out experts to investigate evil Spirit’s hiding place, preparing to destroy it in one fell swoop.</p><p>Another half a month passed, and they finally found out where evil spirit was hiding. It was in a barren land north of the Azure continent. In a short time, the experts of the various large sects in the Azure continent gathered in the North.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect was in the North, and the various superpowers gathered outside the mountain Gate of the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>Dragon God Valley was led by the Ice Dragon patriarch and the cloud Dragon Valley master. They led a large number of experts to battle, while the Ice Dragon Valley master guarded Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing also set off with the Army and joined the Army.</p><p>In Cloud Dragon Valley, second senior brother Longyuan Shan stayed behind to hold the fort. Tian Chui and Xue ningxin’s cultivations were still weak, so they did not bring them along. As for yang tianzong, Lu Ming’s fourth and fifth senior brothers, who were All Saints, they would fight together.</p><p>After a few days, they arrived outside the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>Many people had gathered outside the jiuxiao sword sect. They were all experts from various sects. Even the weakest of them was a high-level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that bubble seemed to have gone into seclusion a few days ago. She had transformed into a ball of white light and enveloped herself like a cocoon.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that bubbles was about to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly happy too. If bubbles broke through to the sage state, with the space-time law, its power would be even more shocking.</p><p>Outside the jiuxiao sword sect, more and more people gathered.</p><p>After a few days, all nine top sects had arrived.</p><p>This time, each top sect sent two absolute Saints.</p><p>The nine top sects added up to 18 absolute Saints. In addition, there were even more Supreme Saints and light Saints. Such a powerful force gathered together could sweep away all the sects in the Azure continent.</p><p>In addition to half-Saints and high-level martial Royal realm experts, there were tens of thousands of them. All of them were elites, and more than half of the experts in the Azure continent were gathered here.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the jiuxiao sword sect hollered before taking the lead and flying north.</p><p>Jiuxiao sword sect was located in the North and was the most familiar with the geography of the area. Hence, he asked jiuxiao sword sect to lead the way.</p><p>Tens of thousands of experts swept across the world with their terrifying auras.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It was amazing that so many experts had gathered. If they joined forces, no one could stop them except for Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Very quickly, they flew into a vast mountain range. Furthermore, the further they went, the more barren the terrain became.</p><p>Slowly, a thick fog appeared in front of them.</p><p>Everyone perked up and raised their guard. The absolute Saints stood outside to prevent any sneak attacks.</p><p>He continued forward and flew for about a thousand miles.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Everyone’s aura exploded as they took a defensive stance and looked forward.</p><p>A large group of figures appeared in front of them.</p><p>At the very front were the sect master of the sky demon sect, the Yu Du sect master, and the other absolute Saints.</p><p>There had only been 10 absolute Saints when they had retreated last time. Now, there were two more, making a total of 12 absolute Saints.</p><p>The absolute Saints from the Alliance also flashed and appeared at the front.</p><p>The people from both sides stopped and faced each other.</p><p>It seemed like evil spirit knew that they were coming and had already gathered their powerhouses to wait for them.</p><p>“Evil spirit religion’s remnants must be exterminated!”</p><p>The sect leader of the life-and-death Sword sect said coldly. On his body, there were two colors, black and white, which were constantly moving. They were wisps of sword Qi.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. Evil spirit will eventually rule the Azure region, and even a wider territory. Those who are enemies with my evil spirit will all die!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly. Her eyes fell on Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, and her expression was ferocious.</p><p>you’re talking big. Today, we’ll destroy evil spirit!</p><p>An absolute Saint from the evil moon sect stepped out. He was covered in dark moonlight and looked terrifying.</p><p>This person had been heavily injured by the sneak attack on the Tian Yu demonic sect last time. He had recovered recently and hated the Tian Yu demonic sect and the Yu Du sect to the core. He couldn’t help but attack.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The other absolute Saints also stepped out, shaking the ground.</p><p>“A mere lower tier absolute Saint, kill!”</p><p>stop! at this moment, a loud shout rang out. It did not come from any of the other party, but from behind the evil spirit Group. Then, a middle-aged man in a purple and gold robe stepped into the air.</p><p>This person was wearing a Jade crown and was filled with a noble aura, like an Emperor of the mortal world.</p><p>In his hand was a golden battle sword, like the sword of an Emperor. He slashed out, and a golden sword light slashed toward the expert from the evil moon sect.</p><p>This sword Qi was boundless and extremely terrifying. Its vast pressure made many people have the urge to worship it and not resist.</p><p>“Absolute Saint in the great circle!”</p><p>The absolute Saint from the evil moon sect roared in disbelief and tried to block it. Endless Moonlight Rose up to block it.</p><p>However, it was all in vain. The sword light shattered the moonlight, and the terrifying sword light cut into the body of the evil moon sect absolute Saint.</p><p>The evil moon sect absolute saint’s body froze. His eyes were wide and filled with shock.</p><p>Then, a bloody gash appeared on his glabella, and his body was split apart from the middle.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>An absolute Saint had died just like that, killed by a single sword.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the other absolute Saints ‘pupils constricted in disbelief.</p><p>Absolute Saint in the great circle!</p><p>This middle-aged man, who was filled with the aura of an Emperor, was actually an absolute Saint in the great circle.</p><p>How could the other party have such a powerful expert?</p><p>The Azure continent didn’t even have an absolute Saint in the great circle. Even the Ice Dragon patriarch hadn’t reached the great circle of the absolute Saint realm after living for countless years.</p><p>Lu Ming was even more shocked.</p><p>He was very familiar with the man’s temperament, which reminded him of Di Yi.</p><p>Yes, the other party’s temperament was similar to Di Yi’s, and di Xian, who had gone to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>“Di family, you are a di family’s man!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The hearts of many people trembled. The DI family was an Emperor-ranked power located in the Northwest of the Azure continent.</p><p>“It seems that you guys have good eyesight!”</p><p>The noble middle-aged man spoke indifferently. His body emitted a golden radiance, and he looked down at his subjects like an Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
