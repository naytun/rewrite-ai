Lu Ming was not surprised. It was said that mixed energy tokens were given to people with great potential. Before Huang Ling broke through to the Emperor realm, she had awakened the bloodline of the undying Phoenix, one of the top ten war beasts. She was not weaker than Long Chen. It was normal for her to obtain a mixed energy token.</p><p>...</p><p>“Could it be that Hunyuan sect’s final test is coming?”</p><p>Huang Ling said with a hint of anticipation in her eyes.</p><p>“Hunyuan sect’s final test!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>When he first obtained the primordial chaos token, a voice was sent to him, indicating that he had passed the initial test. Later on, tu Yi had told Lu Ming that the primordial chaos token was related to the issue of the successor of the primordial chaos sect.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had been waiting. After so many years, was it finally time?</p><p>The three primordial chaos tokens floated above their heads, and the light grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>In the end, they formed three pillars of light that enveloped the three of them.</p><p>“I … I want to go too, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles flew into Lu Ming’s arms. Initially, Lu Ming was afraid that the light pillar would reject bubbles. After all, bubbles did not have the primordial chaos token. He did not expect that the light pillar did not have any abnormalities.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The light pillar buzzed. Then, Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and Long Chen disappeared. Of course, bubbles also disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he was travelling through time and space. This feeling was very similar to when he went to the chaos Hall. He must have travelled through a long space to have such a feeling.</p><p>Suddenly, his body shook. Lu Ming realized that he was on a small boat.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>It was as if there were clouds in all directions. It was a vast expanse of clouds and mist. One couldn’t tell North, South, East, or West. There was no land or sky.</p><p>Beneath him, a small boat was suspended in the vast clouds.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bubbles had also entered. She was beside Lu Ming and looked around curiously.</p><p>the previous generation’s space-time spirit rat was one of the nine Hall Masters of the Hunyuan sect. Perhaps because of this, bubbles could enter without a Hunyuan token!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly guessed.</p><p>“Phoenix spirit, Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the right.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen were on Lu Ming’s right. Under their feet, there was a boat floating in the clouds.</p><p>Feng Ling, someone from your Phoenix Palace must have entered this place before, right? what should we do next? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>No. Huang Ling shook her head. the battle of Providence has been going on for countless years. Every once in a while, someone will obtain a mixed energy token and enter the final assessment place. However, the place of entry is different every time. Therefore, I have no experience!</p><p>that’s right. I’ve also seen similar records in the divine elephant sect. The starting point of the Hunyuan sect’s final assessment is different every time, but the later stages are the same!</p><p>Long Chen said.</p><p>“Do you know what kind of existence the Hunyuan sect is? The war for Providence that he controls can actually spread throughout the entire continent?”</p><p>Lu Ming had always been very curious about this question.</p><p>it’s said that Hunyuan sect is a peak force in the heaven realm. It’s extremely powerful. There are countless powerful ultimate techniques in the origin continent, all of which were inherited from Hunyuan sect. It’s said that Hunyuan sect is looking for a successor!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>could it be that all the talented and promising youths in the entire Yuan continent will come for the final test? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s not necessarily the case. Hunyuan sect is the strongest inheritance in the world, but it’s not the only one. There are other inheritances as powerful as Hunyuan sect. Also, some heaven’s favorites didn’t participate in the battle of Providence, so they naturally can’t take part in the final test. However, there will definitely be a large number of heaven’s favorites with terrifying potential. We might meet them later!</p><p>Huang Ling explained again.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This time, they might see a large number of peerless geniuses from all over the yuan continent. Those who could get the primordial chaos token were definitely people with great potential.</p><p>Some of the heaven’s pride experts ‘realms had probably already reached an unimaginable level.</p><p>“What should we do next?”</p><p>Long Chen asked.</p><p>we can only move forward. The direction of the bow of our three-leaf boat is the same. Let’s move forward!</p><p>Lu Ming suggested.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen nodded. The three of them poured their Saint energy into the boat, and it flew forward quickly.</p><p>This place was vast and boundless. There was no direction, no land, and no starry sky. The three of them could only keep moving forward.</p><p>However, after several days, they still didn’t find anything. The surroundings were still filled with clouds and mist, as if there was no end.</p><p>Fortunately, the three of them were very patient. They sat cross-legged on the boat and cultivated as they moved forward. They were not in a hurry.</p><p>Bubbles, on the other hand, was very curious at first. She blinked her eyes and looked to the left and right. When she realized that there was nothing but clouds all around her, she laid on the boat and fell asleep.</p><p>Time passed day by day. In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed, and they were still travelling in the clouds.</p><p>“Guys, look. What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, Huang Ling exclaimed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Long Chen also looked ahead.</p><p>In the endless clouds, there was a figure, an incomparably huge figure.</p><p>This figure was sitting cross-legged in the clouds. It was as high as the sky and incomparably huge. Endless clouds and mist swirled around it.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>The three of them narrowed their eyes. This figure was so huge that even a 10000-feet-tall mountain was like an ant in front of it.</p><p>“What a strong sword intent!”</p><p>The closer they got, the more they felt a terrifying sword will coming from the figure, as if it was going to split the world.</p><p>He was definitely a terrifying existence.</p><p>However, this figure just sat there cross-legged, motionless.</p><p>“No, it’s a Phantom, not a real body!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up carefully and suddenly spoke. He realized that this figure did not really exist. It was just a Phantom.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen let out a long breath. That figure gave them too much pressure. It was definitely an unimaginable existence. They were afraid that they would die from a single breath.</p><p>“If someone who practices the way of the sword comes here, it’s definitely a great opportunity!”</p><p>Huang Ling sighed.</p><p>If a swordsman came here to comprehend the sword essence of the giant figure, he would definitely gain something.</p><p>However, none of the three of them specialized in the way of the sword, so they were naturally not of much use.</p><p>The three of them steered the boat around the huge figure and continued forward.</p><p>However, not long after, they encountered another figure. This figure was also incomparably huge, and this figure was emitting an incomparably dense metal attribute aura.</p><p>To the three of them, it was not of much use, so they went around it.</p><p>In the next few days, they encountered five huge figures that were suspended in the vast clouds and mist, emitting all kinds of different auras.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
