It was located in the mountains of the distant sea, along with the cloud region and the Emperor region.</p><p>Most of the people in the Azure continent had no idea how big the world was or how many powerful forces were outside of the Azure continent.</p><p>...</p><p>In their eyes, Emperor Cang was the most powerful existence in the world.</p><p>As for evil spirit, they had dozens of Emperor level experts. Naturally, they thought that evil spirit was the most terrifying power in the yuan continent.</p><p>This was normal.</p><p>Before Lu Ming went to the hundred clan battlefield, he did not expect that there would be so many Emperor-level forces in the yuan continent.</p><p>I can’t go on like this. I don’t know how long I have to fly. I have to find a teleportation array. Otherwise, it will be too slow!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>However, in the yuan continent, only Emperor-level forces could build a teleportation formation.</p><p>“Go down and find out which Emperor-ranked force this is!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a plan. He put away the space-breaking shuttle, stepped on the air, and landed in a big city.</p><p>this is the blood jade state, ruled by the blood jade Palace. Isn’t xu Ran a disciple of the blood jade Palace? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>In the hundred clan battlefield, Lu Ming and Xu Ran got to know each other through a fight. In the end, they had a feeling of appreciation for each other and their relationship was not bad.</p><p>Later on, Xu Ran was captured by the natives of the hundred clan battlefield. Lu Ming was also the one who saved him.</p><p>When they parted, Xu Ran had also invited Lu Ming to visit him at blood jade Palace when he was free.</p><p>Since this was blood jade Palace’s territory, he could find Xu Ran and use the blood jade Palace’s teleportation array to head to the ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming asked for the direction to the blood jade Palace and flew there.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming arrived outside the blood jade Palace and sent a message to Xu Ran.</p><p>Not long after, he saw Xu Ran flying out of blood jade Palace.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to really come and look for me.”</p><p>Xu Ran laughed and was quite surprised.</p><p>“Xu Ran, you’ve broken through to the Saint realm. Congratulations!”</p><p>Lu Ming sized Xu Ran up and smiled.</p><p>what’s there to congratulate you for? you’ve probably broken through to the Saint realm long ago, right? ”</p><p>Xu Ran sized Lu Ming up and realized that he could not see through Lu Ming’s cultivation.</p><p>“I’ve also just broken through to the sage realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“I knew it, you must have broken through to the Saint plane. Oh right, weren’t you in the Azure continent? Why did he suddenly come to blood jade Palace? It can’t be that you’re here just to see me, right?”</p><p>Xu Ran laughed.</p><p>“It’s a long story!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. evil spirit has been revived. The remnants of evil spirit have already occupied the Azure continent, the Emperor continent, and the cloud continent. I had no choice but to run away!</p><p>“What? Evil spirit?”</p><p>Xu Ran’s face changed.</p><p>“Xu Ran, how much do you know about evil spirit?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. Xu Ran came from an Emperor-level force. He might know more about evil spirit than Lu Ming.</p><p>I’m not particularly sure either. I only know that evil spirit religion appeared 80000 years ago. They had a leader, two vice leaders, and thirty-six Guardian Kings. They were all Emperor-level figures and were extremely powerful. They specialized in killing Emperor-level powerhouses and geniuses with the potential to become emperors. In the ancient Moon Holy Land, many forces changed their expressions when they talked about it!</p><p>the most important thing is that evil spirit is good at controlling people, so their strength is stronger than what they seem on the surface. Back then, many powerful forces of ancient Moon Holy Land joined forces to annihilate evil spirit. I didn’t expect evil spirit to actually revive and come out to do evil again!</p><p>Xu Ran frowned and said.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” I’m here to go to ancient Moon Holy Land and ask them to help us exterminate evil spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Oh, that’s good. I’m going to ancient Moon sanctuary soon too. We can go together. But Lu Ming, don’t have too much hope in asking for help from the ancient Moon sanctuary’s major forces!</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>&Nbsp; since evil spirit was so dangerous, how could those powerful factions from ancient Moon Holy Land ignore it?</p><p>ancient Moon Holy Land is divided by many powerful forces. Although there are many powerful forces, the competition between them is extremely fierce. They probably have no time to care about other things and might not send many Emperor-level figures to help you. Back then, it was evil spirit cult that angered those powerful forces of ancient Moon Holy Land, which was why they were besieged by those forces!</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly. He understood that all forces prioritized their own interests. As long as their interests were not harmed, they would not care much.</p><p>However, no matter how difficult it was, he had to try.</p><p>If he could invite the help of a powerful force from ancient Moon Holy Land, he would be able to save Cloud Dragon Valley master and the others earlier.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t be discouraged. I’ll report this to the higher-ups. I can’t decide what to do with them!”</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>it’s a small matter. Lu Ming, let’s go and stay in blood jade Palace for a few days. After two days, I’ll go to ancient Moon sanctuary with you!</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and entered the blood jade Palace with Xu Ran.</p><p>Xu Ran’s status in blood jade Palace was very high. After arranging a courtyard for Lu Ming, he went to report the matter of evil spirit.</p><p>Two days later, Xu Ran came to Lu Ming to inform him that the evil spirit incident had been reported and that the blood jade Palace’s Martial Emperor already knew about it. However, he did not know what the Martial Emperor would do.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Indeed, only a Martial Emperor could interfere in this matter. They could not and could not interfere in the Martial Emperor’s decision.</p><p>Lu Ming, let’s go. We’ll go to ancient Moon sanctuary. I heard that the Jade Lake saintess from a major force in ancient Moon sanctuary has appeared and is interested in choosing a guardian. The geniuses of all the major forces around ancient Moon sanctuary have already set out. During this time, ancient Moon sanctuary will probably be very lively!</p><p>Xu Ran said with an expression of anticipation.</p><p>“The Jade Lake Saint?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled. He knew nothing about ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>yes, the Jade Lake is a very special force. It is full of women, all of whom are beautiful, especially the saintesses, who are as beautiful as fairies. Every 20 years, the Jade Lake will produce a batch of saintesses. This time, there are nine saintesses in total!</p><p>it’s said that each of them is as beautiful as a fairy, like a goddess who has descended to the mortal world. Furthermore, they are extremely talented and have profound cultivation. If they can become Dao protectors, wouldn’t that be a wonderful thing? ”</p><p>Xu Ran’s eyes were already shining as he spoke.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He was not in the mood to look at beautiful women now.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Xu Ran walked towards the teleportation array of blood jade Palace.</p><p>They stepped onto the teleportation formation and left blood jade Palace.</p><p>Not long after, they appeared in an ancient city.</p><p>This place was not Gu Yue Holy Land, but an ancient city outside Gu Yue Holy Land.</p><p>The various Emperor-ranked powers could not directly teleport to ancient Moon Holy Land. They could only teleport to the ancient city outside ancient Moon Holy Land, and then set out from the ancient city to ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran did not stay in the ancient city. They flew directly to the ancient Moon sanctuary.</p><p>Not long after, a vast mountain appeared in front of them. The peaks rose into the sky like sharp swords. From afar, it was boundless and magnificent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
