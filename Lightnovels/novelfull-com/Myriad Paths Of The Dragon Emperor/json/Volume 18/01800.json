After another hour, they were close to the furnace.</p><p>...</p><p>The closer they got, the more they felt the magnificence of the pill Furnace Mountain. It was so tall that it reached the sky, like a huge pili furnace.</p><p>Furthermore, there was also a strong medicinal fragrance that constantly wafted over, making people’s spirits rise and their thoughts active.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In front of him, a violent roar came.</p><p>It turned out that someone was bombarding the mountain.</p><p>On the mountain, there was a huge stone door. A few young geniuses were constantly bombarding it. All kinds of terrifying attacks landed on the stone door, causing violent rumbles. However, the stone door did not move at all.</p><p>After bombarding for a moment, the few young men retreated and shook their heads helplessly.</p><p>“It can’t be broken at all, and the entire mountain is unbreakable!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>There were many young men in this area, and all of them had gloomy expressions.</p><p>When he reached the mountain Gate, he couldn’t enter, which made him feel a little unwilling.</p><p>The arrival of Lu Ming and the group attracted the attention of some people.</p><p>A young man in a brocade robe with an extremely sharp aura glanced at Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others with lightning-like eyes. He was surprised and said coldly,” “How did you guys manage to get here?”</p><p>“Hehe, why can’t we come here?”</p><p>Huang Ling retorted with a cold smile.</p><p>Long Chen transmitted his voice to Lu Ming. This young man was also a heaven’s pride expert of the WAN family. He was the number one heaven’s pride expert of the WAN family, Wan Zhengyang.</p><p>Obviously, not all the geniuses of the WAN family, the Sirius tower, and other forces had surrounded Huang Ling and the others. Perhaps, in their eyes, those people were enough.</p><p>Wan Zhengyang’s eyes were cold as he thought,” could it be that the others didn’t encounter Feng Ling? Long Chen and the others must be so. Otherwise, that force alone would be enough to kill Feng Ling and the others!</p><p>“It’s nothing. You guys are quite lucky!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang smiled faintly.</p><p>On the side, the other geniuses of the Sirius tower, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace also looked at Huang Ling and the others with malicious eyes.</p><p>They also thought that Huang Ling and the others were just lucky that they didn’t encounter anyone who wanted to kill them.</p><p>However, in this place, there were geniuses from all the major forces, so it was not good to make a move.</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Another person stepped forward and attacked the stone door, attracting the attention of others.</p><p>This person had the cultivation of Supreme Saint upper tier. Among the younger generation of ancient Moon Holy Land, he was definitely a top existence. However, he could not break the stone door. After dozens of attacks, the stone door did not move at all and could only retreat in defeat.</p><p>Following that, other experts stepped forward, but it was all useless.</p><p>This included Wan Zhengyang. As expected of the number one prodigy of the WAN family. His combat strength was terrifying, and his cultivation had reached the peak of the Supreme Saint realm.</p><p>There weren’t many in the entire ancient Moon Holy Land who had reached the peak of the great saint realm at such an age.</p><p>However, Wan Zhengyang did not blast the stone door open.</p><p>After that, a few more heaven’s favorites at Wan Zhengyang’s level appeared. They were all the strongest heaven’s favorites from the big families and sects, but they all returned empty-handed.</p><p>Many people were silent. Outside the mountain, Emperor-ranked experts were not allowed to enter as they would be blocked. But now, here, a stone door was blocking the young heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>Could he not enter the great Yan elixir Hall?</p><p>Many people were extremely unwilling.</p><p>hey, did you guys see that? there’s a brand on the stone door…</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Long Chen and Lu Ming.</p><p>1 see it! It’s very similar to the primordial chaos inheritance token!</p><p>Lu Ming and Long Chen both nodded.</p><p>They had seen a mark in the center of the stone door, which looked exactly the same as the primordial chaos inheritance token.</p><p>There were words in the middle of the mark, but perhaps too many years had passed, the words could no longer be seen clearly.</p><p>“Do you want to try?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>wait a bit longer. There are so many people here. If we try it here and the door is opened, it will benefit others!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen nodded, and everyone waited here.</p><p>However, after a few days, the number of people here increased instead, showing no signs of decreasing.</p><p>“I’ll draw them away, you guys take the opportunity to try!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming moved along the mountain of alchemy furnaces and came to the other side. Then, he punched the mountain. The mountain glowed and let out a violent roar. It could not be broken at all, but the sound spread far and wide.</p><p>“There’s an entrance, an entrance has opened here!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his voice and shouted.</p><p>“What? There’s an entrance, is that true?”</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s real or fake, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Almost everyone cast their shadows and pounced in Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>Lu Ming changed his appearance and left the place, heading in the direction of the stone door.</p><p>When he returned to the stone gate, he saw that Feng Ling and Long Chen’s expressions were not good.</p><p>“It’s useless!”</p><p>Long Chen shook his head at Lu Ming.</p><p>Long Chen and I tried it just now. We took out the primordial chaos inheritance token, but there was no reaction at all!</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“No reaction?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. Could it be that they were wrong?</p><p>However, that imprint looked very similar to the primordial chaos inheritance token. They guessed that it was very likely that the ancestor of the great Yan elixir Hall was also an inheritor of the primordial chaos sect. He left behind this stone door and only the inheritor of the primordial chaos sect could enter. Could their guess be wrong? Just a coincidence?</p><p>At this moment, the other young men had already returned.</p><p>I’m cursing. I’ve been deceived. Which bastard is shouting?”</p><p>“If I know who’s toying with us, I’ll definitely kill him!”</p><p>Many people were cursing and swearing, knowing that they had been cheated.</p><p>Then, some people began to study the stone door, but they also found nothing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, could it be that the level of our legacy tokens is not high enough? you’re a golden inheritor. You might be useful!”</p><p>Huang Ling sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had also thought of this possibility.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll lure them away. You try!”</p><p>Long Chen said. Then, he silently headed in another direction.</p><p>Not long after, there was a roar.</p><p>“There’s an entrance here!” Following that was another loud roar.</p><p>f * ck, it’s the same trick again. That bastard is lying to us again!</p><p>“If it’s true, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Some of them cursed and ran toward that direction. However, this time, some of them did not move and stayed behind, especially Wan Zhengyang. He had been keeping an eye on Lu Ming and the others. Now that he saw Long Chen disappear, he became even more suspicious and stayed behind.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. However, he could not care so much.</p><p>Hunyuan sect’s gold inheritance token appeared in his hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the Golden inheritance token appeared, it vibrated and a ray of light shot out, falling on the mark on the stone door.</p><p>“It’s really useful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“You have the key?”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang looked at Lu Ming with a burning gaze.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The stone door trembled and glowed with resplendent light. Then, another door of light appeared.</p><p>“It’s opened, the great Yan elixir Scripture is mine!”</p><p>Wan Zhengyang was overjoyed. His body was like lightning as he charged toward the door of light..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
