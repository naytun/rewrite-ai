Huang Ling, Long Chen, you helped Lu Ming kill four of our geniuses and caused a ruckus at the thousand spirit exchange. Do you think we’ll let this go? You will have to pay with your lives!”</p><p>...</p><p>A heaven’s favorite of the WAN family sneered, revealing his sharp edge and cold killing intent.</p><p>so it’s because of this. Hmph, your Wan family has already lost many geniuses. Don’t let all of them die!</p><p>Long Chen said coldly. The aura on his body became violent. His body swelled up, and his arms became thick and large, containing endless power.</p><p>you’re the ones who will die. Attack together!</p><p>The WAN clan’s heaven’s pride expert coldly shouted.</p><p>However, at this moment, a series of air-piercing sounds came from afar. Four or five figures flew over at extreme speed, causing the expressions of the paragons of the WAN family and the Skywolf tower to change slightly.</p><p>The next moment, five figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s really lively. Brother Wan, how about we join in on such a good event?”</p><p>One of the Golden-robed young men spoke, his voice filled with killing intent.</p><p>“So, you are brothers from the gold Crow clan. Good, hahaha, let’s attack together!”</p><p>The paragons of the four forces were overjoyed.</p><p>The faces of Feng Ling, Long Chen, and the others turned even uglier.</p><p>“People of the gold Crow clan, we have no grudges against each other, why do you want to hit me when I’m down?”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Facing the four forces, they were already in danger. With the Golden Crow race’s prodigy, they were in even more danger.</p><p>“No grudges? It’s laughable that you’re with Lu Ming. That means you have a grudge against us. We’ll kill everyone who’s with Lu Ming!”</p><p>Said a young man in a golden robe. His voice was extremely cold. He was the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. Back in the Phoenix’s nest, he had almost been stripped of all his feathers by Lu Ming. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>“Let’s kill them together and find the inheritance of the Dayan elixir Palace!”</p><p>The leader of the WAN family shouted. His body glowed with light, and Saint weapons flew out.</p><p>This man’s cultivation was extremely terrifying. He was in the minor mastery of the Supreme Saint realm and was no weaker than Wan Pingyang. He was also one of the strongest heaven’s pride experts of the WAN family.</p><p>In addition, the Sirius tower, the purple Extreme sect, and the heavenly Bird Palace all had Supreme Saint geniuses. In total, there were five Supreme Saint geniuses, and one of them was even a Supreme Saint in the profound level.</p><p>This power was extremely terrifying, enough to kill Feng Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>Furthermore, he had the help of the Golden Crow Tribe.</p><p>Among the five people of the Golden Crow clan, there were two Supreme Saints. They were the fifth and fourth prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>All of them were peerless geniuses. Each of them had the ability to fight above their level. Ordinary Supreme Saints couldn’t compare to them.</p><p>“Charge out!”</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen’s expressions were extremely ugly. They gathered together and rushed madly in one direction.</p><p>“You won’t be able to escape, kill!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the four factions, as well as the Golden Crow race, attacked together. Terrifying attacks poured toward them.</p><p>die! Long Chen roared and used all his strength. He punched dozens of times in an instant, destroying the attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huang Ling used the law of inextinguishable flame. The cry of a Phoenix resounded through the world and protected the others.</p><p>However, with so many experts joining forces, Long Chen and Feng Ling’s bodies still trembled. Their faces turned pale and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>the law of unperishable flame and the law of extremity. These two King bodies should be killed!</p><p>One of the WAN family’s heaven’s favorites shouted with a jealous expression.</p><p>Long Chen and Feng Ling had comprehended the laws of the king path, which was called the king body. The more they cultivated, the stronger their combat power would be in the future. In the future, they would far surpass them. It was the best time to kill them now.</p><p>This was also the reason why the monarch-level experts from the four forces had ordered them to kill Long Chen and Phoenix spirit.</p><p>The king physique would be incomparably terrifying when it grew in the future, suppressing all the heroes. At that time, the strength of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect would be even more astonishing, surpassing the other forces.</p><p>Therefore, such a genius should be killed in the cradle.</p><p>In any case, even if they died in the great Yan elixir Palace, no one would know how they died and they wouldn’t be blamed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Exterminate the king physique!”</p><p>Voices filled with killing intent rang out, and even more terrifying attacks were launched at Huang Ling and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling and the rest moved like waves and moved a hundred meters away, avoiding the attacks.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In the sky, a loud shout rang out, causing those with weaker cultivations to scream in pain. Following that, a huge finger descended from the sky like a god’s move, pointing towards the WAN clan’s geniuses.</p><p>“This is … The Laws of Chaos are Lu Ming’s!”</p><p>The WAN clan’s heaven’s pride expert let out a desperate roar. He exploded out with all his strength, and his Saint weapon rushed towards the giant finger, hoping to block it.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had broken through to the Supreme Saint realm and his combat power had skyrocketed. How could he stop the finger of tribulation of chaos?</p><p>The primal Chaos finger of tribulation crushed over. The heaven’s favorites of the WAN family who were below the Supreme Saint realm didn’t even have time to scream. Their bodies exploded and their souls were destroyed.</p><p>The Supreme Saint heaven’s favorite didn’t resist for long. He let out an unwilling roar and his body exploded.</p><p>Another Supreme Saint of the WAN family had fallen!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A young man in a black robe descended from the sky. His black hair was flying in the wind, and his face was cold. More than a hundred holy weapons were flying around him. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Huang Ling, Long Chen, and the others were overjoyed.</p><p>The paragons of the other forces were shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you actually dare to appear again and kill the WAN clan’s prodigy. This time, you won’t be able to escape even if you have wings. No one can save you!”</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the Skywolf tower shouted.</p><p>“If 1 kill all of you, who will know?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>kill all of us? what a joke! Although your combat strength is strong, with so many of us working together, it’s more than enough to kill you!</p><p>A purple-robed young man stepped out from the purple Extreme sect. His purple hair flew in the wind, and his aura was wild.</p><p>This person had the cultivation of a Supreme Saint in the upper tier. He had a medium grade heavenly spiritual body and was unparalleled in the world. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>that’s right. If we join forces, we can kill him!</p><p>Someone from the Golden Crow race also stepped out. Together with the Paragon of the purple Extreme sect, they formed a horn. Their violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>He was the fourth prince of the Golden Crow. He was stronger than the fifth Prince of the Golden Crow and also had the cultivation of the Supreme Saint.</p><p>you guys, send a few people to stop Feng Ling and Long Chen. The rest of you, kill Lu Ming with me!</p><p>The Paragon of the purple Extreme sect ordered.</p><p>Suddenly, two Supreme Saints rushed toward Long Chen and Feng Ling, blocking their way.</p><p>Their mission was to stall Huang Ling and Long Chen while the others killed Lu Ming. As long as they could kill Lu Ming, they would be able to annihilate Huang Ling and the rest.</p><p>Purple light burst forth, forming a purple-grade combat sword that charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The Golden Crow let out a long screech as the Grand sun’s flames burned fiercely. The Golden Crow spread its wings and tore through the air. The terrifying Grand sun’s true flames surged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the other eminent Saint stage geniuses also launched terrifying attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, be careful!”</p><p>Huang Ling reminded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He took a step forward with his holy weapon sword in hand.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Countless runes appeared in the sky, forming a terrifying sealing power that enveloped the Golden Crow fourth prince and the others.</p><p>not good! It’s the array Dao law, the power of sealing!</p><p>how does he have two laws?”</p><p>The fourth golden Crow Prince and the others roared in disbelief..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
