Before it even arrived, two ice blades shot out of its horns and slashed at the sect master of the sky god sect.</p><p>the old Ice Dragon of Dragon God Valley is still alive!</p><p>...</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect roared, and his face was extremely heavy. Holy light filled the air, and he continuously slashed out two swords of holy light, blocking the two ice blades.</p><p>“Even if you die, this old man won’t die!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon roared and approached at an extreme speed. Its dragon claws grabbed at the sect masters of the sky god sect and the sky demon sect. A terrifying howl rang out in the sky. Wherever the Dragon claws passed, the space seemed to be frozen.</p><p>The sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect did not dare to be careless. They used their magical powers to resist the Ice Dragon together. However, they were forced to retreat continuously. Their bodies were covered in a layer of ice and were almost frozen.</p><p>“Ice Dragon Kingdom!”</p><p>The ice on the Ice Dragon patriarch’s body grew stronger and stronger. In the end, it seemed to have transformed into a Kingdom. Within this kingdom, countless ice dragons appeared and roared as they pounced towards the two sect Masters.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two sect Masters exploded with all their strength, but they were still completely suppressed by the Ice Dragon.</p><p>On the other side, there were two less experts. The sect master of the desire poison sect and another absolute Saint of the deity sect were no match for the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley and the valley master of Ice Dragon Valley. They were suppressed by the two and were at a disadvantage.</p><p>In the sky, the battle between the absolute Saints was extremely violent. After a dozen moves, the sect Masters of the tianshen sect and the Tianyu demon sect coughed up blood and retreated. They were injured by the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>“Retreat! Retreat first!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect and the others roared and began to retreat.</p><p>If the battle continued, it would be disadvantageous to them.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was able to fight two absolute Saints. The Ice Dragon patriarch was even stronger than the cloud Dragon Valley master. They were no match for him. If they continued fighting, they would be in danger of dying.</p><p>They retreated as they fought.</p><p>All the disciples and elders of the three sects also retreated.</p><p>Bang! Bang …</p><p>The Ice Dragon stomped in the air and chased after the sect master of the tianshen sect and the Tian Yu demon sect. With every step it took, terrifying ice would fall like meteorites.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Although the two of them tried their best to resist, they still spat out large mouthfuls of blood and their faces turned pale.</p><p>“Dragon God Valley, you’re going to make the world your enemy. Let’s see how long you can protect Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect howled. Her hair was disheveled, and she looked like a crazy woman.</p><p>A terrifying demonic light burst out from her body. In the end, she self-detonated several great saint weapons and rushed out of the ice Dragon ancestor’s attack range. The sect master of the tianshen sect followed closely behind her. The two of them were far away in an instant.</p><p>The other powerhouses also flew at high speed and fled quickly. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared from the sphere of influence.</p><p>The experts of Dragon God Valley didn’t pursue.</p><p>Don’t chase after a cornered enemy. If the other party went crazy and fought back with all their might, they would also be injured.</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley heaved a sigh of relief after the people of the three major sects had left.</p><p>The three major sects, including the tianshen sect, were extremely powerful among the many forces in the Azure region. Each sect was not weaker than the Dragon God Valley. If the three major sects joined forces, the Dragon God Valley would be no match for them.</p><p>If the legendary Ice Dragon ancestor had not appeared, they would have been in real danger.</p><p>“All disciples, clean up the battlefield and guard the place!”</p><p>let’s go! the master of Ice Dragon Valley gave the order, glancing at the people of Silver Dragon Valley who were hiding at the back with cold eyes.</p><p>this Lu Ming is really lucky. He’s fine even after this!</p><p>The valley master of Silver Dragon Valley did not notice the valley master of Ice dragon’s gaze. His eyes were fixed on Lu Ming, and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Greetings, Ice Dragon ancestor!”</p><p>patriarch Ice Dragon! the valley Masters of Ice Dragon Valley, Cloud Dragon Valley, and the others bowed to the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch twisted his body and turned into a burly old man. He waved his hand and said, ” “No need!”</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and took a step forward. He appeared in front of Lu Ming and sized him up curiously.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets the Ice Dragon patriarch!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>haha, you’re not bad, kid. Come with me!</p><p>Then, without saying anything else, he walked toward the great snow Mountain in the depths of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. Why was the Ice Dragon patriarch looking for him?</p><p>“Ming ‘er, go!”</p><p>The voice of the cloud Dragon Valley master rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed the Ice Dragon patriarch in the air.</p><p>The two of them, one in front and one behind, headed deep into the snow Mountain.</p><p>In the depths of Dragon God Valley, there were vast and endless snow mountains. The two of them crossed dozens of snow mountains before the Ice Dragon patriarch finally stopped at a random Snow Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming landed beside the Ice Dragon patriarch and did not say anything.</p><p>your spirit body should be the nine Dragons combat body, right? ”</p><p>Said the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>The nine Dragons combat body was the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>that’s right. The bloodline I awakened was the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons should be able to evolve continuously until you reach the upper-class heavenly spiritual body. I can see that your blood Qi is strong and will evolve soon. I’ll give you three drops of blood essence to help you!</p><p>A Jade bottle appeared in the Ice Dragon patriarch’s hand and he handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took the bottle instinctively. He opened it and found three drops of blood essence in the bottle. They were like dazzling blood diamonds, exuding a terrifying Dragon’s might. There was even a small dragon circling the surface of the blood essence.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock. He could sense the aura of an absolute Saint from the three drops of blood essence.</p><p>These were three drops of blood essence of the Holy true dragon.</p><p>The spiritual essence of the true dragon blood was definitely more abundant than that of the Dragon Valley. These three drops of blood were priceless.</p><p>“Many thanks for senior’s generous gift!”</p><p>Lu Ming thanked him sincerely.</p><p>you’re welcome. I obtained these three drops of blood essence by accident. They’re not of much use to me now. You can take them. Well, take good care of Xue ningxin in the future!</p><p>Said the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed like the relationship between the Ice Dragon patriarch and Xue ningxin was not simple.</p><p>An Ice Dragon and a Snow Dragon.</p><p>“Forefather!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his mouth and a storage ring appeared in his hand. old ancestor, today’s battle was all because of me. This storage ring is Emperor Cang’s storage ring. I will hand it over to you now. You can distribute it to the entire Dragon God Valley as you wish …</p><p>This war was all because of him. Moreover, Lu Ming had a feeling that this matter would not end so easily. He could not bear to implicate the entire Dragon God Valley. Since he could not open the storage ring of Emperor Cang, he might as well give it up to enhance the strength of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“The ring of Emperor Cang? You can keep it. This is your own opportunity. Dragon God Valley will not deprive any disciple of his opportunity. Depriving a disciple of his opportunity is the same as depriving him of his potential. How can he give birth to a peerless master?”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch waved his hand and continued, however, this ring has Emperor Cang’s imprint on it. I’m afraid that even if I attack, I won’t be able to break the imprint in a short period of time. Keep it for now and you’ll be able to break it by yourself in the future!</p><p>Since the Ice Dragon patriarch had said so, Lu Ming did not say anything more and kept Emperor Cang’s storage ring.</p><p>“Go, little guy. I look forward to your growth!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming bowed to the Ice Dragon patriarch and left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
