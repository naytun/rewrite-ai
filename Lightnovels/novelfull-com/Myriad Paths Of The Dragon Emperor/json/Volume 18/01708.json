I heard that Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures were obtained by Lu Ming of the Dragon God Valley. Ask him to hand them over. Such treasures can’t be swallowed by him alone, nor can your Dragon God Valley sect!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke. His voice was deep and filled with dignity.</p><p>he is indeed here for Emperor Cang’s inheritance and the storage ring!</p><p>Lu Ming squinted his eyes and looked at the sect master of the sky demon sect. A fire of anger was slowly burning in his heart.</p><p>The divine realm sect was one thing, but the heavenly universe demon sect and the divine realm sect were the first to arrive.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had been tolerant and restrained towards the Tian Yu demon sect for Xie nianqing’s sake.</p><p>However, the Tian Yu demonic sect had been insatiable and had attacked him more than once.</p><p>The sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect was aware of his relationship with Xie nianqing. However, he did not care and joined forces with the deity sect to oppress Lu Ming. This made Lu Ming’s heart turn cold, and his killing intent even colder.</p><p>Since that was the case, there was no need for him to restrain himself when he met the people of the Tian Yu demon sect in the future.</p><p>“Haha, the two of you, where did you hear this from? how can the two of you believe in such a baseless rumor? You even brought so many experts from the two sects, how laughable!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master walked out and laughed.</p><p>“Whether it’s a rumor or not, whether it’s true or not, we’ll know once we search Lu Ming’s soul!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said indifferently.</p><p>what a joke. You think I can search your soul just because you said so? then come over here and let me search your soul!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said coldly as he glared at the sky demon sect master.</p><p>you’re being unreasonable. If you don’t allow me to search your soul, that means you’ve obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. I advise you to hand them over. Your Dragon God Valley sect can’t stop or protect them!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly.</p><p>that’s right, Valley master. I suggest that we hand Lu Ming over. Otherwise, the Dragon God Valley will be in danger. We can’t implicate the entire Dragon God Valley because of Lu Ming!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley suggested to the master of Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the cloud Dragon Valley master suddenly turned around and coldly looked at the silver Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Valley master, you see …”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” Ice Dragon Valley master! the valley master’s expression changed as he continued to speak to the valley master.</p><p>alright, Lu Ming is a disciple of Dragon God Valley. Regardless of whether he has obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance or treasures, Dragon God Valley has the duty to protect him. You don’t have to say anything more about this matter!</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master spoke, causing Yin Zheng’s expression to turn ugly.</p><p>Emperor Cang ruled the Azure continent in the past. He was the Emperor of the Azure continent. His inheritance and treasures shouldn’t be shared by only one person and one sect. All the sects in the Azure continent should share them. You’d better hand them over!</p><p>The heavenly God sect’s sect master continued.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. Let’s not talk about the fact that Lu Ming didn’t get it. Even if he did, it’s his own luck. According to what you said, all the resources of your heavenly God sect come from the Azure continent. How can your heavenly God sect monopolize them? take them all out and share them with everyone in the Azure continent!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sneered.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said with a cold face, ” how can this matter be compared? if Lu Ming doesn’t hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, your Dragon God Valley will be destroyed. Your name will be removed from the Cang continent, and everyone will be buried with you!</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the tens of thousands of experts from the heavenly God sect and the heavenly demon sect all erupted with terrifying auras. The atmosphere in the heavens and earth was incomparably oppressive. With so many people unleashing their auras, it was simply too powerful.</p><p>also, even if you hide in Dragon God Valley, it’s useless. The families of your disciples are all outside, scattered all over the Cang region. I don’t mind sending people to destroy them!</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect continued. His words infuriated everyone in the Dragon God Valley, but they were also very worried.</p><p>despicable! As the sect leader, you’re so despicable! You’re just like the Divine Child!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming had killed the divine Son. How could he let Lu Ming go so easily?</p><p>“You’re breaking the rules!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Even if two sects were to go to war, the family members and clans of a particular sect’s disciple would usually not be implicated. This was an unspoken rule in the entire world of martial Dao.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be a mess.</p><p>“The rules are set by the strong!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said arrogantly.</p><p>good, very good. In that case, I will kill every disciple of the heavenly God sect I see in the future!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master revealed a rare killing intent.</p><p>“Yun ruoxu, I’m afraid you don’t have the ability!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley said. Then, he took a step forward and appeared outside the Dragon God Valley’s protective array. A long sword appeared in his hand.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from the cloud Dragon Valley master’s body.</p><p>“Then I’ll see what abilities you have as a sect master!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice rang out. Then, a terrifying sword light slashed towards the sect master of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Yun ruoxu, you haven’t fought for many years. I’d like to see what you’re capable of.</p><p>A spear of divine punishment appeared in the hands of the sect master of the tianshen sect.</p><p>The long spear pierced through the air, reaching a length of 10000 Zhang. It was as if it could shatter the void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword light and the long spear clashed, and the sky and earth rumbled. A terrifying force caused the void to shake violently. The ground was hit by the force, and a terrifying Gully appeared.</p><p>Some of the energy flew toward Dragon God Valley, but was blocked by the sect-protecting array.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The experts of the Tian Yu demon sect and the Tian Shen sect retreated, afraid that they would be affected.</p><p>Only the sect master of the sky demon sect remained still.</p><p>“The cloud Dragon appears!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his long sword and a huge true dragon formed. It roared and pounced at the sect master of the deity sect.</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect burst forth with holy light, which actually condensed into a giant God. The God stepped in the void with a long spear in his hand, and stabbed toward the giant true dragon.</p><p>The two of them collided again, and the whole world was about to be pierced through.</p><p>Many people were watching in shock. Such a great battle was simply too shocking.</p><p>the cloud Dragon Valley master is actually so powerful. It’s too shocking!</p><p>“Is the cloud Dragon Valley master an absolute Saint? My God, the cloud Dragon Valley master is an absolute Saint!”</p><p>The disciples of the Dragon God Valley were all shocked by the news.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley had the least number of people among the Seven Valleys of the Dragon God Valley. They had always been regarded as the weakest. The people of the other Dragon valleys did not take the cloud Dragon Valley seriously. They subconsciously thought that the cultivation of the valley master of the cloud Dragon Valley would not be much stronger.</p><p>Apart from the valley master of Ice Dragon, the other Valley Masters of the seven Dragon God valleys were all Supreme Saints. Previously, most of the disciples of Dragon God Valley had thought that the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley should also be a Supreme Saint.</p><p>He had never expected the cloud Dragon Valley master to be an absolute Saint.</p><p>“Three appearances of Cloud Dragon!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his sword. This time, three void raging roars shot out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
