He realized that the combat sword in his hand had a chip.</p><p>...</p><p>A great saint weapon really couldn’t take an absolute Saint weapon head-on.</p><p>Wan tianbing suppressed Lu Ming with one strike and was invigorated. His body was like a stream of light, appearing in front of Lu Ming in an instant and his battle axe slashed down again.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was sent flying as well. There was even a crack on the combat sword.</p><p>“Kill, kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Wan tianbing, let’s kill him in one go!” He shouted.</p><p>Over at the WAN clan’s side, a young man clamored, while an old man coldly spoke.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The heavenly soldiers ‘morale was high. Their battle axes were like a storm as they slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. Two shield-type holy weapons flew out from his surroundings and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The battle-ax chopped down, and the two shields were cut in half.</p><p>A bright Saint weapon was as fragile as tofu in front of an absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After two consecutive moves, Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>10000 celestial weapons! With your cultivation, I’m afraid your body won’t be able to hold on for long before it backfires!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, his voice still very calm.</p><p>“Enough to kill you!”</p><p>Wan tianbing roared and attacked wildly.</p><p>Indeed, he could not afford to waste any more time. Just as Lu Ming had said, he could feel the terrifying pressure. The immense combat weapon Qi was tearing his body apart at all times. A thin layer of blood had seeped out of his skin. He had to get rid of Lu Ming as soon as possible.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Then, the space between his eyebrows glowed and a Tai Chi formation disk appeared.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and the Tai Chi formation disk emitted a brilliant light. A Tai Chi pattern swirled on the surface and pressed down on Wan tianbing.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Wan tianbing’s giant axe landed heavily on the Tai Chi formation disk. The Tai Chi formation disk became even more dazzling, shook violently, and was knocked back. However, there was not even a mark on the surface of the Tai Chi formation disk.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Wan tianbing’s eyes widened in disbelief. What kind of treasure was Lu Ming using? it could even block an absolute Saint weapon and not even leave a scratch on it.</p><p>Then, he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took out the Tai Chi formation disk to block. Although the Tai Chi formation disk would be sent flying every time, it managed to block the attacks of the ten thousand celestial soldiers each time while he remained unscathed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. The Tai Chi formation disk was most likely an Imperial-level treasure. It was just that Lu Ming could not fully unleash its power yet.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wan tianbing roared and slashed wildly at Lu Ming, but every time he did, he was blocked by the Tai Chi formation.</p><p>The WAN family’s faces darkened.</p><p>Lu Ming is truly unparalleled. He has mastered the Laws of Chaos. He is undoubtedly the son of chaos!</p><p>An old woman from the Phoenix Palace said, her eyes full of admiration.</p><p>the son of chaos is known as one of the sons of God. He has great fortune and his talent can be said to be heaven-defying. Since ancient times, any Son of God who has mastered the ten ultimate laws will have unimaginable achievements as long as he doesn’t die!</p><p>this kid is very close to Phoenix spirit. In that case, Phoenix Palace can only befriend him and not offend him. If he grows up in the future, it will only be beneficial to Phoenix Palace!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Several elders of the Phoenix Palace spoke one after another and communicated with each other through voice transmission.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying air-piercing sound came from behind Lu Ming. The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow was coming at him again.</p><p>“You still dare to sneak attack with an injured body? then I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The great saint Sword in his hand suddenly slashed backward.</p><p>Now, there were six great saint weapons sealed in Lu Ming’s body. The power was terrifying. With one sword strike, a shrill scream rang out, accompanied by golden feathers flying in the air. One of the wings of the sixth golden Crow Prince had been cut off by Lu Ming.</p><p>The sixth Prince of the Golden Crow was already injured by Lu Ming, so he was naturally no match for him.</p><p>The Golden crow’s sixth Prince paled in fright and flapped his remaining wing desperately to retreat.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the Golden Crow sixth Prince’s wing. Then, he pointed his finger at the Golden Crow sixth Prince. A terrifying finger pointed at the Golden Crow sixth Prince. The Golden Crow sixth Prince was horrified and tried to escape with all his might, but it was too late. The finger of tribulation of chaos was approaching him at an extreme speed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, a golden light flashed and struck the chaos finger of tribulation, directly breaking it and allowing the sixth golden Crow Prince to escape.</p><p>It was an old man from the Golden Crow clan who had saved the sixth Prince.</p><p>“How despicable!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue’s words were straightforward, and her voice resounded throughout the entire venue.</p><p>The expert from the Golden Crow clan coldly glanced at mu Qingxue and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the Golden Crow Tribe. He did not pursue the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow but looked at Wan tianbing.</p><p>At this moment, Wan tianbing’s eyes were bloodshot, and he was covered in blood.</p><p>This was not Lu Ming’s blood, but his own. He had been torn out by the backlash of the absolute Saint weapon, and the backlash was getting stronger and stronger. The ten thousand celestial soldiers could no longer withstand it.</p><p>Suddenly, Wan tianbing’s body trembled and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His aura quickly withered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such an opportunity? the Tai Chi formation disk floated above his head. With a combat sword in hand, he charged at Wan tianbing.</p><p>Wan tianbing could only barely raise his battleaxe to block in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Wan tianbing’s body was sent flying like a cannonball. He couldn’t even hold the battleaxe in his hand. The battleaxe shook and flew out of his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the void and swept up his Saint energy, sweeping Wan tianbing’s battleaxe over and storing it in his storage ring. At the same time, he continued to attack Wan tianbing with his combat sword.</p><p>Wan tianbing was suffering from a terrifying backlash. His physical body was about to be torn apart and he was severely injured. How could he withstand Lu Ming’s attack?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Wan tianbing roared.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>An elder from the WAN family stepped out and waved his hand. A ray of Saint power wrapped around Wan tianbing like a ribbon and pulled him behind him. Then, a cold light flashed in his eyes as he struck out with his palm. A huge palm print blasted towards Lu Ming, trying to kill him.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He did not expect the other party to be so despicable. Not only did they interfere directly, but they also attacked him.</p><p>Although it was just a casual attack, the other party’s realm was too high, and the power was still terrifyingly strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk above Lu Ming’s head trembled and glowed with a brilliant light. It expanded rapidly and rushed toward the huge palm print. At the same time, Lu Ming erupted with all his strength and pointed with his finger.</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos tribulation finger exploded with power, sending a massive Primal Chaos tribulation finger forward while he rapidly retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk was the first to be hit by the giant palm. It shook violently and the Tai Chi pattern on it was shattered. It shrank rapidly and flew toward Lu Ming, disappearing between his eyebrows.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
