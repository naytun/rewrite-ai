The entire Cloud Dragon Valley seemed to be shaking. The ice layer that was as hard as diamond on the ground shattered. The elder of Silver Dragon Valley smashed a big hole in the ground. He lay there, spitting out blood and twitching like a dead dog.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, the entire place was silent.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>Many people’s throats seemed to be stuck by something. They kept squirming, but they couldn’t say a word.</p><p>This was because many people recognized that the elder was an extremely powerful elder of Silver Dragon Valley. He was at the peak of the bright Saint realm. However, he was like a dead dog in Lu Ming’s hands. He could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>Lu Ming, this was too abnormal!</p><p>Even yang tianzong, Tian Chui and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p>“Who else wants to make a move?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the surroundings. Those who were caught by his gaze were shocked and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, you can only fight your own people here. If you’re so capable, go and fight the people of the deity sect and the Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>A silver-robed youth mustered his courage and shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the person, causing the person to shrink back and retreat. He avoided Lu Ming’s eyes, not daring to look him in the eye.</p><p>“It seems that you’re quite bold. Alright, do you want to come with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>The man mumbled.</p><p>“If you don’t have the guts, then shut up!”</p><p>go! Lu Ming shouted. He then rose into the air and flew in the direction of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Is Lu Ming really going to fight the people from the deity sect, the Tianyu demonic sect, and the Yu Du sect?”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>The crowd followed Lu Ming out of Dragon God Valley. Yang tianzong, Tian Chui, and the others exchanged glances and followed.</p><p>The entrance of Dragon God Valley was guarded by many masters of Dragon God Valley. The Masters of the Seven Valleys were all there.</p><p>Lu Ming’s arrival attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>“Ming ‘er. You’ve broken through?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s gaze fell on Lu Ming. His eyes suddenly lit up and he looked pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“Yes, master, I just broke through!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Good! As expected of the person who killed the Divine Child!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Ice Dragon Valley master also stepped forward, a smile on his face.</p><p>“Master, Valley master, I have a plan that might be able to force the three great sects to retreat!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, are you really confident?”</p><p>After hearing Lu Ming’s words, the cloud Dragon Valley master looked surprised and worried.</p><p>The eyes of the Ice Dragon Valley master also flickered. It was clear that his state of mind was fluctuating and he was extremely shocked.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was very firm.</p><p>“Alright, then master will protect you!”</p><p>The valley master said.</p><p>“Add this old man!” Valley master Ice Dragon stroked his long beard and laughed.</p><p>“Thank you, master, Valley master!”</p><p>Lu Ming saluted and then strode out of Dragon God Valley. He passed through the sect-protecting array and walked forward step by step.</p><p>“Lu Ming really went out!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Yin Zheng, on the other hand, had a smug look in his eyes.</p><p>“Eh, Valley master and the others have also gone out!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>At that moment, the valley Masters of Ice Dragon Valley and cloud Dragon Valley were following Lu Ming forward.</p><p>When Lu Ming left Dragon God Valley, the tianshen sect, Tianyu demonic sect, and Yudu sect naturally saw him. Immediately, many experts flew toward Lu Ming and stopped not far away from him. The two parties stood in the air.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve finally come out. Have you thought it through and decided to hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures?”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>“How about I make a bet with you?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“A bet?”</p><p>The sect masters of the sky god sect, sky universe God sect, and the others were stunned.</p><p>What was Lu Ming up to?</p><p>However, with so many of them here, Lu Ming would not be able to come up with any tricks.</p><p>“Bet on what? What do you want to bet on?”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>let’s bet on Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. I challenge the three sects ‘bright sages. As long as you’re in the bright sages’ realm, you can fight me. If I lose, I’ll hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures. If you lose, you’ll go back to where you came from. How about it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This was his plan.</p><p>It was a bet with the other party, and it depended on whether the other party had the confidence to take it.</p><p>“You have indeed obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect said with a greedy look in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He knew very well that even if he denied it strongly, the other party would not let it go. It was useless to deny it. He might as well admit it directly and take a gamble with the other party.</p><p>“Do you guys dare to bet or not? If you want to capture me and search my soul, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed. Before you capture me, I can still kill myself. At that time, you won’t get anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold.</p><p>The eyes of the sect Masters of the tianshen sect, the Tianyu demon sect, and the Yudu sect flickered.</p><p>“What do you guys think?”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect sent a message to the other two.</p><p>I guess this kid has already broken through to the sage realm!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>“So what if you’ve broken through to the sage realm? Just breaking through to the Saint plane, was he already invincible among the Saint plane? He’s underestimating us!”</p><p>The desire poison sect’s sect master laughed coldly.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, the three major sects had a long history and they had accumulated many bright sages.</p><p>Over the long years, there were many people with high-grade earth spiritual bodies who had broken through to the sage state. Moreover, some of them had been stuck in the great circle of the bright sage Stage for a long time. Some of them had even cultivated super powers and their combat strength was extremely powerful. No matter how powerful Lu Ming was, he had just broken through to the sage state. How could he be a match for these old monsters?</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect and the others also thought of this point. After some discussion, they all nodded.</p><p>To be able to easily obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures, why not?</p><p>“Alright, we agree!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>“Alright, which one of you will fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>In the Yu Du sect’s area, a thin middle-aged man stepped out, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>A peak bright Saint!</p><p>He came to Lu Ming and the two of them stood opposite each other.</p><p>At this time, the people of Dragon God Valley were also shocked. Lu Ming actually wanted to challenge all the bright Saints of the three major sects. How was this possible? it was unbelievable.</p><p>Everyone watched with wide eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body exploded with a shocking aura. The vast Saint might shot into the sky.</p><p>the sage state! Lu Ming has broken through to the sage state!</p><p>how terrifying! How long has it been since he broke through to the sage realm? how can he be so fast? ”</p><p>he was only at the second stage of the half-Saint realm in the treasure fixing assembly a year ago. He only broke through the third stage after fighting with the divine Son. How could he break through to the Saint realm so quickly? ”</p><p>Many people were shocked and started to discuss.</p><p>Could it be because of Emperor Cang’s treasure?</p><p>When many people thought of this, their eyes became even more fiery.</p><p>It must be. Many people thought that Lu Ming had broken through so quickly because of Emperor Cang’s treasure.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
