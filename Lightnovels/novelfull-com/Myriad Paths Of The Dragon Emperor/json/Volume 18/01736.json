The powerhouses of the Emperor family and evil spirit sect began to attack. All kinds of attacks poured toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others could only retaliate with all their might.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the other party had more people, and there were two absolute Saints in the great circle. They were no match for them at all, and they were forced to retreat. They were at a disadvantage.</p><p>The two absolute Saints in the great circle were too powerful. After more than ten moves, the weakest absolute Saint was injured.</p><p>he still hasn’t used his halberd. It seems like he really can’t use it!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke. His eyes were flickering with a cold light.</p><p>Since he and the people of the deity sect could not escape and were under the control of evil spirit, he did not want the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others to escape, especially Lu Ming.</p><p>At the very least, he had to take down Lu Ming and the rest and turn them into evil Spirit’s puppets.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The two absolute Saints in the great circle were even bolder. They held the Emperor swords and their sword Qi was vast. They were like human emperors who could conquer the world.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>An absolute Saint from the demon Castle was pierced by the sword Qi. He was severely injured and almost died.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The others also continued to charge forward, breaking the defensive formation of the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>An absolute Saint in the great circle of the Emperor family shouted and stared at the expert from the demon Castle. His attacks were like a tide, and the Emperor sword was slashed out, destroying everything.</p><p>“You guys hurry up and leave!”</p><p>The cultivator from the demon Castle roared and tried his best to block, but it was useless. In the end, he was cut in half by a sword and died here!</p><p>“Kid, you’re a talent. Surrender!”</p><p>The DI family’s expert stared at the young heaven’s favorite of the demon Castle, who was being carried by the expert from the demon Castle, and said coldly.</p><p>“I surrender!”</p><p>The Paragon of the monster Castle had no choice but to surrender.</p><p>At this time, another angry roar came from another person. The dantian of an absolute Saint from the sky King Palace had been pierced by another absolute Saint in the Great Perfection of the Emperor family, and his Saint heart had been destroyed.</p><p>The sword light turned the absolute Saint into ashes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two absolute Saints had died.</p><p>“We can’t fight them head-on, charge!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master let out a long roar. The remaining eight people tried their best to break through, but the other party was too strong. They were completely blocked and found it difficult to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>we can’t go on like this. We have to split up and disperse the other party’s strength. Otherwise, we’ll all be left behind!</p><p>Said the Ice Dragon patriarch.</p><p>that’s right. The eight of us will form groups of two and break out of the encirclement. Whether we can break out or not will depend on our luck!</p><p>The sect leader of the life-death Sword sect said.</p><p>“I’ll open the way!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch let out a long roar and turned into a huge Ice Dragon. He opened his mouth and spat out a snow-white Dragon Horn, which emitted a terrifying power.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch showed a trace of reluctance in his eyes and then roared, ” “Explode!”</p><p>The snow-white Dragon Horn exploded with a boom, and a terrible cold current rushed out. An absolute Saint of the DI family was frozen by the cold current, turning into an Ice Man.</p><p>An absolute Saint in the great circle was pushed back by the cold current, and his body was covered in a layer of ice.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch roared and rushed out. The others followed closely behind. They broke out of the encirclement. Then, the eight absolute Saints split into four groups and ran in four directions.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch and the cloud Dragon Valley master led Lu Ming and Xie nianqing in a group.</p><p>The two absolute Saints of the life-and-death Sword sect led Luo Xiang and the other two heaven’s favorites in one group. The two great beings from the Linglong Palace formed another group. The Lord of the demon Castle and the lord of the sky King Palace formed another group.</p><p>“Split up and chase!”</p><p>An absolute Saint in the great circle roared.</p><p>“We can’t let that Lu Ming go. He’ll definitely be a big problem once he grows up!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The absolute Saint in the great circle personally led a group of people to chase after Lu Ming and the others. The others split up and chased after the other groups.</p><p>that expert in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm has his eyes on us!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s face was dark.</p><p>With the combat power of the cloud Dragon Valley master and the Ice Dragon patriarch, they were confident of escaping if there was no absolute Saint in the great circle watching them. However, it would be difficult if an absolute Saint was watching them.</p><p>The two of them carried Lu Ming and Xie nianqing as they flew at top speed. However, the other party was obviously faster and the distance between them was constantly closing.</p><p>“Master, patriarch, we must split up!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>The enemy’s target was obviously him. If they split up, Xie nianqing’s chances of escaping would be very high.</p><p>If they worked together, it was very likely that none of them would be able to escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t split up. Let’s go together!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. How could she not know what Lu Ming was thinking?</p><p>“Lu Ming is right. We must separate. Patriarch, you take nianqing and I’ll take Lu Ming. We’ll take as many as we can!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch was also very decisive and nodded directly.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Xie nianqing was still reluctant.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch grabbed Xie nianqing with his huge claws. With a long roar, he separated from the cloud Dragon Valley master and flew in another direction.</p><p>“You guys go after that Ice Dragon. Leave these two to me!”</p><p>The absolute Saint in the great circle ordered the other absolute Saints to chase after the ice Dragon patriarch, while the great being in the great circle continued to chase the cloud Dragon Valley master and Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>With the Ice Dragon elder’s combat strength, as long as he wasn’t up against a perfected absolute Saint, there was a high chance that he would be able to escape.</p><p>The absolute Saint was indeed staring at him.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming did not use the mountain and river diagram to store other people.</p><p>If he put the others into the mountain and river diagram, the other party would be less of a target. They would only need to keep an eye on him. In that case, they would not be able to escape. As long as he could capture Lu Ming, he would be able to wipe them out.</p><p>The best way was to split up.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master brought Lu Ming along and transformed into a beam of sword light. In the blink of an eye, they traveled a thousand miles, and the endless Mountains beneath their feet swept past.</p><p>you can’t escape. Since your combat strength is not bad, you should surrender obediently. Otherwise, only death awaits you!</p><p>The Supreme Saint of the DI family said coldly. His body seemed to have turned into a golden sword light, breaking through the air at an amazing speed.</p><p>Even if the cloud Dragon Valley master tried his best, he was unable to pull away. Instead, the distance between the two sides was getting closer and closer.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Behind them, the DI family’s expert slashed out a sword light towards Lu Ming and the other man. The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his sword to block it. With a clang, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s body trembled and his face turned pale. However, he still used this force to fly forward for a hundred miles.</p><p>“Master …”</p><p>Lu Ming was worried.</p><p>“I’m fine. Ming ‘er, you go first. I’ll block him!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. no, this person is too powerful. He’s a perfected absolute Saint. I can’t let master stay here alone!</p><p>If the cloud Dragon Valley master stayed behind to stop the other party, the odds would be against him. Lu Ming would never agree to that.</p><p>Ming ‘er, there’s only hope as long as you escape. Now, your senior brothers and so many people from Dragon God Valley have fallen into the hands of evil spirit cult. Dragon God Valley will definitely not be safe from now on. Your only hope now is on you. With your talent, you will definitely rise in the future and destroy evil spirit cult and the DI family!</p><p>“If you’re also caught, then there’s really no hope at all. Do you understand?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master continued to transmit his voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
