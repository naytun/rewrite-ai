Back then, when he was a spirit God, he only felt that tu Yi and the others were unfathomable and difficult to fathom.</p><p>Now that he saw it, he still felt the same.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming was even more delighted. The stronger Earth One and the rest were, the more help they would be to him.</p><p>“Seniors, now that Lu Ming has broken through to the sage state, can you all go out and help him?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Earth One, gold one, and the others looked at each other. Earth One then shook his head and said, ” “Young master, it was possible in the past, but I’m afraid not now!”</p><p>“No, why not?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>because you’re not the only young master of chaos now!</p><p>Earth One sighed.</p><p>“Not just me? What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>Could it be that after Lu Ming, there was another person who met the requirements and passed the test?</p><p>However, the chaos Scripture had already been passed on to Lu Ming. Even if someone came later, they should not be able to get the chaos Scripture, right? How did he become the young master of the primal Chaos Hall?</p><p>young master, another person came after you, but he didn’t come because he cultivated five different wills or domains. It’s because of his body. His body is the chaotic body!</p><p>Gold one explained.</p><p>“Chaotic body!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The chaotic body was only a Constitution of legend. Could it be that there really was such a Constitution in the world?</p><p>“It’s truly unbelievable. The chaotic body is something that only appears once in countless years. In truth, the chaotic Thearch had the chaotic body, so the chaotic body is the most suitable for inheriting the Thearch’s legacy. However, the young master has already obtained the chaos Scripture. When the chaotic body arrived, he did not obtain the chaos Scripture!”</p><p>however, the other party has the chaotic body. It’s hard to find one in countless years. He’s too compatible with the venerable sovereign back then. Since he’s here, we’ve all discussed and decided to let him become one of the young masters of the primal Chaos Hall. Thus, in the future, only one of you will be able to truly control the primal Chaos Hall!</p><p>Earth One explained.</p><p>“So you’re saying that I’ll have to compete with the chaotic body in the future, and only the one who wins will be able to control the primal Chaos Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. Only the winner can truly take control of the primal Chaos Hall. Therefore, before the winner is determined, we will not go out with either of you, nor will we help either of you!</p><p>Earth One said.</p><p>Lu Ming felt helpless. He did not expect to encounter such a thing.</p><p>He knew very well that the chaotic body was the same as the chaotic Thearch’s body. It was the most suitable body to inherit the chaotic Thearch and control the chaotic Palace. If Lu Ming had not come first and obtained the chaos Scripture, tu Yi and the others would have definitely chosen the chaotic body.</p><p>“Young master, this subordinate would like to remind you that the chaotic body’s current cultivation level is far higher than young master’s. His battle prowess is even greater, and he’s invincible among those of the same level. He doesn’t have the chaos Scripture, but because he has the chaotic body, he has also cultivated the Laws of Chaos. His goal is to take your chaos Scripture, young master. You must be extremely careful when you encounter him outside!”</p><p>Earth One reminded.</p><p>tu Yi, don’t cross the line. Our principle is not to help either side!</p><p>Gold one reminded him.</p><p>I was just giving you a casual reminder. I didn’t mean to help you. Alright, young master, I’ll send you back now. I hope that the next time I come, it’ll still be the young master!</p><p>Earth One smiled and waved his hand. A powerful force acted on Lu Ming and he disappeared from the chaos Hall.</p><p>“Tu Yi, you seem to be more optimistic about Lu Ming?”</p><p>Gold one’s entire body was golden, like a statue of gold. His voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>Earth One shook his head and sighed. we’ve waited for countless years, and finally Lu Ming has come and inherited the venerable sovereign’s legacy. However, we didn’t expect that another chaotic body would appear. We didn’t expect that after the venerable sovereign, another chaotic body would appear in the world. Such a heaven-defying body just had to appear at this time. It seems that the great era is coming. I’m afraid the Tian Yuan world will welcome a Golden Age!</p><p>that’s right. Let’s see what happens. If Lu Ming really encounters the body of chaos, he will most likely be defeated. However, this child is very lucky. Even you and I can’t see through his fate. I’m afraid that things are not that simple. Let’s just watch!</p><p>After gold one spoke, the hall fell silent.</p><p>Lu Ming felt the world spinning around him. Not long after, he was back at the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“The chaotic body?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>This trip was indeed beyond Lu Ming’s expectations. He thought that he could ask Earth One and the rest for help, but it seemed that he could only rely on himself now.</p><p>“Then let’s have a good fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Then, he exited the mountain and river diagram and stepped out of the cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived at the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, he found a large number of people gathered there.</p><p>“Lu Ming has come out!”</p><p>Someone shouted and everyone’s eyes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hmph, he finally couldn’t hold it in and came out!”</p><p>“He’s monopolizing the treasure and hiding himself, leaving the danger to us. He wants us to fight for him. Why should he?”</p><p>he’s selfish and doesn’t care about the lives of the others in Dragon God Valley. I’ve never seen such a shameless person!</p><p>make him hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures to resolve the crisis of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>In the crowd, there were people constantly shouting, causing the crowd to be enraged.</p><p>“Sowing discord again!”</p><p>Yang tianzong’s eyes were like lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s figure suddenly darted out. He stretched out his hand and grabbed the neck of a silver-robed young man, lifting him up.</p><p>“It’s your Silver Dragon Valley again. You’re sowing dissension. You must be killed!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was cold.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? Don’t tell me you won’t let us talk about what you did. If you have the ability, kill everyone in the divine Dragon Valley!”</p><p>The disciple of Silver Dragon Valley shouted.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming, let him go!</p><p>“Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because of your cultivation!”</p><p>The other disciples of Dragon God Valley shouted.</p><p>you selfish man. I will capture you now and hand you over to the other sects!</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared behind Lu Ming and clawed at Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>It was a white-haired old man with an extremely profound cultivation. With a single claw, his Saint might was vast, and his Saint power burst forth. He was actually a powerhouse at the peak of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>It was obvious that an elder of Silver Dragon Valley had seized the opportunity to capture Lu Ming while the crowd was still angry. Then, he had asked everyone to hand Lu Ming over.</p><p>His claws were very fast and shockingly fast as he approached Lu Ming at an extreme speed.</p><p>He did not believe that Lu Ming could avoid it.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong and he had killed the divine Son at the fixed treasure auction, he was still very powerful.</p><p>However, the divine Son was only a perfected bright Saint after all, while he was at the peak of a bright Saint. It was a sudden attack, and Lu Ming would definitely not be able to Dodge it.</p><p>However, at the next moment, his pupils suddenly shrank because Lu Ming suddenly turned around and looked at him with a sword-like gaze. The next moment, he felt a tearing pain in his soul in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s big hand grabbed his throat and pressed him to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
