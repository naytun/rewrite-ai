A shocking murderous intent burst out from his body.</p><p>He could guess the situation at the scene with just a glance.</p><p>...</p><p>Mo Yang, no one will be able to save you today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>“You, block him!”</p><p>die! Mo Yang roared, and his figure charged forward like lightning.</p><p>The other elder would not be so foolish as to stop Lu Ming. Back then, outside Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming had displayed terrifying combat strength. The bright Saint was invincible. If he went up, he would only be courting death. He turned and ran in another direction.</p><p>Lu Ming would definitely chase after Mo Yang first. That way, he would be able to escape.</p><p>“None of you can escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He clenched his fist in the air, and a terrifying devouring power burst out.</p><p>As his spirit body evolved, his devouring power also became stronger.</p><p>The devouring power enveloped Mo Yang and the old man at the same time. Their bodies were subjected to a terrifying gravitational force. Not only were they unable to fly forward, but they were also forced to retreat.</p><p>“Ah, how could this be? Fly, fly!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Mo Yang roared. He was so scared that his guts were about to split apart. He tried his best to fly forward, but his body was retreating faster and faster.</p><p>The old man was the same. He couldn’t even fly out with his Saint realm cultivation. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>Very soon, the two of them retreated to a spot not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>spare me, spare me! I didn’t do anything! It was all Mo Yang’s doing!</p><p>The old man roared, betraying the old man.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mo Yang glared at the old man.</p><p>“You’re all jackals of the same lair, you’ll die!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. His holy power was like a knife, cutting the elder into two. His soul was destroyed at the same time.</p><p>A Saint in the initial bright Saint realm was completely helpless in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>At this time, Qiu Ying Ying had already pulled out the demonic Qi blade from Qiu Hao’s body. Qiu Hao crawled to the young lady’s side and hugged her body like a fool.</p><p>This made Lu Ming’s gaze turn even colder. A cold killing intent enveloped Mo Yang, and his eyes revealed a look of fear.</p><p>“So, how do you want to die?”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming’s gaze fell on Mo Yang.</p><p>Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. There are so many powerful forces in the sky demon sect Alliance. If you kill me, not only will you die, but all your family and friends will die as well!</p><p>Mo Yang roared.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming flicked his finger, and a beam of Saint energy shot into Mo Yang’s crotch, blasting it into pieces.</p><p>ah! Mo Yang let out a shrill scream, tears and snot flowing down his face.</p><p>“Even now, you’re still threatening me. What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, Kill Me if You Can. Let me tell you, Xie nianqing is dead too. You will never get her. Hahaha, you’re too naive!”</p><p>Mo Yang laughed like a madman. He seemed to know that he wouldn’t be able to live, so he decided to go all out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled and his eyes emitted a terrifying light.”Speak, what’s wrong with little Qing? What did you do to her?”</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, I won’t tell you. The next time you see her, she’s no longer her. She might even kill you. Hahaha!”</p><p>Mo Yang laughed.</p><p>“Speak, what happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was even colder. He had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>He had already felt that something was wrong with Xie nianqing.</p><p>The first time he went to the Tianyu demonic sect, he was hunted down on his way back. The second time he went, he didn’t even see Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just kill me. Just kill me. I won’t tell you!”</p><p>Mo Yang laughed heartily. He had gone all out.</p><p>“Do you think I can’t do anything if you don’t tell me? I’ll know if I search your soul!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. With a flash, he appeared in front of Mo Yang. He extended his hand and sealed Mo Yang’s cultivation.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t …”</p><p>Mo Yang was finally afraid. He struggled with all his might. However, his cultivation had been sealed. How could he struggle?</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his finger and touched Mo Yang’s glabella. Mo Yang’s body immediately stiffened, as if he had become a fool.</p><p>Lu Ming activated his secret skill. His soul force seeped into Mo Yang’s soul and he began to search his soul.</p><p>However, right at this moment, a terrifying destructive force suddenly burst out near Mo Yang’s soul. It wanted to destroy Lu Ming and Mo Yang’s soul together.</p><p>Mo Yang’s soul is actually under a restriction. It seems like there’s a big secret!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>It was obvious that someone was afraid that Mo Yang’s soul would be searched and his secret would be leaked. Thus, they had set up a seal around Mo Yang’s soul. Once Mo Yang’s soul was searched, the seal would be activated and destroy his soul.</p><p>Once his soul was destroyed, Mo Yang would become an idiot. Naturally, he would not be able to find anything.</p><p>It was very likely that it was a restriction left behind by Mo Yang’s master, the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>“Array Dao!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and activated the array Dao law. Countless runes filled the air and enveloped the destructive power, trying to seal it.</p><p>However, the destructive force was very powerful. It kept destroying the runes that Lu Ming’s array Dao laws had turned into. If this went on, Lu Ming would not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out. Bubbles appeared and he cast the space-time law, which seeped into Mo Yang’s body and enveloped the destructive energy. This temporarily blocked the destructive energy.</p><p>“I have to hurry up!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the soul-searching art. Instantly, a series of vivid images appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, an image caught Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>Lu Ming’s vision seemed to have transformed into Mo Yang’s as he followed a beautiful middle-aged woman down a passage.</p><p>The beautiful middle-aged woman was the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>After walking through the dark passage, they came to an underground cave. In the underground cave, there was a beautiful woman sitting cross-legged, motionless. Her whole body was shrouded in demonic Qi.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. That peerless woman was Xie nianqing.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>In this underground cave, a blood-red mist filled the air. At this time, this blood-red mist gathered together and formed a huge face. It looked like an extremely old woman.</p><p>“Have you brought the materials?”</p><p>The giant face opened its mouth, and its voice echoed in the underground cave.</p><p>“I’ve brought it!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect took out a Jade bottle, from which a few figures flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. That figure was clearly the soul of a Sage.</p><p>The giant face opened its mouth and sucked the souls into its mouth. It revealed an expression of enjoyment before speaking in a sharp voice, ” it’s still not enough. I’m still lacking a little. Hurry up and find me more souls. When I recover a certain amount of soul power, I can use this girl’s body to be Reborn!</p><p>hehe, this girl has a great opportunity. Not only did she obtain the world core of an Emperor-level master, but her body also contains a terrifying power. If I use her body to be reborn, not only will my cultivation be fully restored, but I will also be able to reach a higher level!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
