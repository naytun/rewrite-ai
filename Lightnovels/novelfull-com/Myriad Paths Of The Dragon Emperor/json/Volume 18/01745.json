If they were placed in the Azure continent, they would be the heaven’s favorites of the entire continent. No one would be able to defeat them.</p><p>But here, there was a pile of them.</p><p>The battle went on for half an hour. In the end, a peak bright Saint, a heaven’s favorite from outside the Holy Land, stepped into the pavilion first.</p><p>Although this proud Son of Heaven’s cultivation had also reached the peak of a bright Saint, his combat strength was obviously lower than Wan Tianlong and the others. He could not crush them, so it took him a lot of effort to get onto the pavilion.</p><p>“Damn it, the last Pavilion is definitely mine!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince didn’t step onto the pavilion and was in a bad mood.</p><p>There was only one Pavilion left.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on the last Pavilion. Some of the heaven’s favorites who didn’t fight just now showed their battle intent, like Tuoba Fei.</p><p>When the ninth Pavilion’s Jade stairs descended, at least a dozen figures rushed up the Jade stairs.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Roars rang out as a dozen heaven’s favorites started to fight.</p><p>Tuoba Fei also joined the battle and tried his best to charge forward. As long as he was the first to reach the pavilion, he would win and the others would retreat.</p><p>However, none of the other heaven’s favorites were weak. None of them dared to compete for the position. Needless to say, they had the heavenly spiritual body and their cultivation had all reached the upper tier of bright Saint. If they did not have the combat power to suppress the others, it would be difficult for them to make it.</p><p>All sorts of light glowed as sacred art techniques burst forth and collided intensely.</p><p>Symbols flickered on the Jade stairs and the pavilion. The terrifying force was offset when it landed on them.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The Golden Crow let out a cry as the tenth golden Crow Prince transformed into his three-legged golden Crow form. His wings were like blades, and he was suffused with the Grand SUN TRUE FIRE. He was extremely terrifying, and normal heaven’s favorites of the same level weren’t his match.</p><p>Tuoba Fei was also fighting with all his might, but in the end, he was sent flying by the Golden Crow tenth Prince’s claw. He was sent flying in the air, and even his hair was on fire.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Tuoba Fei roared, unwilling to give up.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran glanced at Tuoba Fei subconsciously. To their surprise, Tuoba Fei caught their eyes.</p><p>He had just been blasted down and his hair was burnt. He was in an extremely sorry state. At this moment, he saw the look in Lu Ming and Xu Ran’s eyes. It was as if he saw the two of them mocking him. He was instantly enraged and vented all his anger on the two of them.</p><p>What are you looking at? you’re just a piece of trash. You don’t even dare to fight for it. You’re a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. What a joke!</p><p>Tuoba Fei shouted coldly.</p><p>In particular, when he recalled that Lu Ming had called him a Mad Dog, he was even more furious.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xu Ran did not respond. They continued to watch the battle on the Jade stairs, ignoring Tuoba Fei.</p><p>“Get lost, you two pieces of trash. Don’t be an eyesore here!”</p><p>Seeing that the two of them dared to ignore him, Tuoba Fei was even more furious. He moved and appeared beside Xu Ran, slapping him.</p><p>Xu Ran was shocked and quickly retreated. However, Tuoba Fei’s speed was too fast for him to Dodge.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming struck out with his palm and it collided with Tuoba Fei’s palm. Tuoba Fei’s body trembled and he felt that the bones in his hand were about to break. He could not help but take two steps back and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>He had felt that the power in Lu Ming’s palm was extremely terrifying, as if it was going to shatter his entire body.</p><p>you’re a Mad Dog. It seems that I have to teach you a lesson!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, his palm as sharp as a knife, and struck at Tuoba Fei at lightning speed. The terrifying pressure completely enveloped Tuoba Fei, like Mount Tai pressing down on him. It was unstoppable.</p><p>Tuoba Fei was shocked and took out a Saint weapon to block it.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s palm hit the Saint weapon, Tuoba Fei’s Saint weapon was deformed and then exploded. Tuoba Fei’s eyes widened.</p><p>Although it was a bright holy weapon, it was absolutely sturdy and immortal. However, it had been blown apart by Lu Ming’s palm, which shocked him greatly.</p><p>The terrifying power made Tuoba Fei spit out blood and retreat.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared above Tuoba Fei’s head in an instant. He stomped on Tuoba Fei’s face. Tuoba Fei screamed in pain and his body fell into the lake like a cannonball.</p><p>Xu Ran was dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p>When he first met Lu Ming in the hundred clan battlefield, Lu Ming’s cultivation was much lower than his. Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was not as good as him. Later on, Lu Ming had surpassed him.</p><p>In the end, when they escaped from the hundred clan battlefield, although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was still far from what he was now.</p><p>It had only been a short while since they last met, but Lu Ming could already abuse Tuoba Fei as if he was a puppy. Even his bright sacred weapon was shattered by Lu Ming with a single palm. What kind of combat strength was that?</p><p>Tuoba Fei could not react in time.</p><p>“Xu Ran, didn’t you want to go up? I’ll walk you up!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, then walked towards the ninth Pavilion.</p><p>Xu Ran then reacted and subconsciously followed Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them, one after the other, stepped onto the Jade stairs.</p><p>“Where did this brat come from? get lost!”</p><p>On the Jade stairs, there was a young man who looked like a black Gorilla. His arms were thicker than other people’s thighs and he was more than three meters tall. He threw a fist the size of a human head at Lu Ming’s head, causing a dull roar in the air.</p><p>This young man had not seen Lu Ming make a move when they were fighting on the Jade stairs. Now, he wanted to punch Lu Ming down.</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two fists collided, and the sound of bones breaking rang out.</p><p>The black Gorilla youth’s eyes popped out, his fist had already completely exploded.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and swung his palm. A huge palm formed and slapped the young Gorilla down the Jade stairs.</p><p>The gazes of many onlookers in the surroundings fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>this person is so strong. He can easily crush the others!</p><p>could it be another prodigy from a Holy Land? ”</p><p>I don’t think so. He came here with blood jade Palace’s Xu Ran.</p><p>Many people were guessing Lu Ming’s identity. The paragons in the other eight pavilions looked at Lu Ming with curiosity.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His soul attack followed his voice and rushed toward the other geniuses on the Jade stairs. Their bodies trembled. Then, Lu Ming threw a punch at them, one by one, and they fell down.</p><p>“What a powerful soul force!”</p><p>From the first Pavilion, Wan Tianlong spoke. However, his voice was still calm. Lu Ming’s soul power was not bad and his combat strength was quite strong, but he was not a threat to him.</p><p>Lu Ming blasted a few people down in succession and strode forward. There were still a few people in front of him who had been fighting, but they all stopped and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s eyes narrowed when he saw Lu Ming. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the few of them casually. He did not stop and strode forward.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s join forces and blast this brat down, how about it?”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s eyes gleamed with a sharp light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
