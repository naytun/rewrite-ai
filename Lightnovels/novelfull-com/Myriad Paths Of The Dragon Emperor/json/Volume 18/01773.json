He was as fast as lightning. In an instant, he had rushed towards Lu Ming. A snow-white sword light bloomed from his hand and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was very strong. Lu Ming had to be cautious. His long spear trembled and turned into a spear radiance, which he stabbed out.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>...</p><p>A series of clashing sounds rang out. The white-robed young man’s figure retreated slightly and was blocked by Lu Ming.</p><p>However, this gave the chaotic body a chance to catch its breath. With a loud roar, it threw out a barrage of punches at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept across and blocked the attack. However, on the other side, the white-robed young man was charging toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Despicable!”</p><p>Not far away, Huang Ling shouted, her eyes wide open.</p><p>The chaotic body was really despicable. He had been acting all high and mighty before, but now that he was no match for Lu Ming, he had to find someone else to help.</p><p>Previously, Huang Ling had cultivated a palm technique. When she struck out with her palm technique, it produced a terrifying flame that forced her opponent to retreat.</p><p>Huang Ling attacked with all her might. Her palm force was overwhelming and unstoppable, not giving her opponent any chance to breathe.</p><p>On the other side, Long Chen had also completely suppressed his opponent. He cultivated a fist technique, and each of his punches was as powerful as a mountain. It was unstoppable, and its power was not much weaker than the chaotic body.</p><p>His opponent was also forced to retreat.</p><p>scoundrel, get down. I’m going to help Brother Lu Ming. Chirpy!</p><p>Bubble’s speed was extremely shocking. Like a flash of light, she circled around a Young heaven’s pride expert. With a flick of her white and tender finger, terrifying wind blades continuously shot towards the other party. The other party was in an extremely sorry state as he was injured in many places and bleeding profusely.</p><p>This young man simply wanted to raise his head and roar at the sky. He was extremely aggrieved.</p><p>He was a heaven’s favorite and was usually high and mighty. Wherever he went, he would be the center of attention. But now, he was forced into such a state by a two or three-year-old little girl. It was really embarrassing.</p><p>Not long after, he was struck by bubble’s wind blade. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and was blasted off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, let me help you!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Pao Pao cried out. In a flash, she charged towards Lu Ming. With a flick of her finger, wind blades flew out and blocked the white-robed youth’s attack.</p><p>The white-robed young man’s face turned cold as his sword radiance burst forth and a dense amount of sword Qi slashed towards Pao Pao.</p><p>Bubbles flicked his fingers continuously, forming countless wind blades to resist the opponent.</p><p>When the white-robed young man had crossed the abyss, he had been in the same category as bubbles. His talent might not have been stronger than bubbles’, so he could only end up in a draw with her.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>With one less opponent, Lu Ming focused all his energy on the chaotic body. He swept his long spear and directly broke the opponent’s attack, almost sending the chaotic body flying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, Lu Ming launched a storm of attacks at the chaotic body. The terrifying spear shadows completely drowned the other party.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few moves, the chaotic body was swept by Lu Ming’s spear. He spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated a few steps, almost falling off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, two more shouts were heard. Two paragons rushed toward Lu Ming, and their terrifying attacks fell on him.</p><p>Clearly, they wanted to team up and defeat Lu Ming first.</p><p>However, at this moment, two figures appeared in the sky and blocked the two people.</p><p>It was Huang Ling and Long Chen. They had also defeated their opponents and had come to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“No one can help you. Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming took advantage of the situation and attacked fiercely. Although his chaotic body tried its best to block, after more than ten moves, he was swept by Lu Ming’s spear. The sound of bones breaking came from his body, and he was sent flying out of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming is outside. Don’t let me see you. Otherwise, I’ll make you wish you were dead!”</p><p>The chaotic body roared furiously. It was filled with unwillingness.</p><p>He had the mighty chaotic body, yet he had been eliminated before reaching the end, and the one who had eliminated him had been his fated enemy.</p><p>“I’ll kill you in the outside world!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply was very simple.</p><p>A pillar of light formed and enveloped the chaotic body. He was sent out under his unwilling gaze.</p><p>He felt extremely aggrieved. He had a powerful cultivation and terrifying combat strength, but he could not unleash them at all. Under such circumstances, he was defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>If he could unleash his full power, he could kill Lu Ming with one slap.</p><p>Many people were shocked. The high and mighty chaotic body, known as one of the sons of God, was defeated by Lu Ming just like that.</p><p>Although this kind of defeat completely suppressed some divine powers and spirit bodies, it was enough to explain many things.</p><p>Although Lu Ming did not have the true chaotic body, it was still unknown who would win in this fated battle about the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The white-robed youth was shocked when he saw the chaotic body being knocked off the stage. He quickly retreated.</p><p>“It’s too late to retreat now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He took a few steps forward and blocked the other party’s retreat. The Spear’s gleam burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles joined forces and the other party could not resist them at all. Within a few moves, he was severely injured and blasted off the fighting ring.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming and bubbles turned to look at the other two people, the two who were fighting with Feng Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>The four of them joined forces, and the result was already decided. The two of them were also knocked off the fighting ring.</p><p>One after another, more than 50 people had been eliminated. There were less than 50 people left in the fighting ring.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming’s group of four with unsightly expressions. If the four of them joined forces, no one would be able to defeat them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s group of four did not join the battle. They stood together and watched the others fight calmly.</p><p>As for the others, no one dared to provoke Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The great battle continued, and people were constantly being eliminated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few hours had passed. When a tall and burly young man was blasted off the fighting ring, there were only 20 people left.</p><p>The twenty people stood in different directions, watching the others.</p><p>The son of death was also among them, and with his battle-power, as long as he wasn’t surrounded by many people, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to stay until the end.</p><p>alright, the twenty of you have advanced. There’s still one last round. If you can pass it, you’ll be able to obtain your fortune!</p><p>The white-robed old man said. With a wave of his hand, a bridge was formed, extending from the fighting stage to the front. There, a door of light was formed.</p><p>Everyone stepped out, followed the bridge, and entered the door of light.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped into the door of light, he felt that the world was spinning. His vision turned black and his consciousness fell into a blur.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how long had passed before he regained consciousness.</p><p>“It hurts, it hurts!”</p><p>The first thing Lu Ming felt when he woke up was pain. It was as if all the bones in his body had been broken. There was a tearing pain all over his body.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes with great difficulty and saw a petite and cute face looking at him with her big eyes.</p><p>It was a very cute young girl. She was thirteen or fourteen years old and was dressed in coarse clothes. She sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had opened his eyes, the young girl’s face lit up and she exclaimed, ” “He’s awake, he’s awake, big brother is awake!”</p><p>As he shouted, he turned around and ran out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
