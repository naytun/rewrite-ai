A ray of sword light soared into the sky and clashed with the huge axe.</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the air, the giant axe and the giant sword light clashed together, creating a terrifying boom. Then, they were both destroyed. No one had the upper hand.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! Lu Ming shouted. He took a step forward and charged at his opponent.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>With a single thought, the Saint weapons around him began to charge at his opponent.</p><p>The burly elder shouted and waved his battle-ax, sending the combat weapons flying. Lu Ming rushed forward with his combat sword in hand. The sword glowed with a milky-white holy light.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow, and they were still equally matched.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step back and took a step in the air, then charged at his opponent again. His opponent did the same. The two of them engaged in an intense battle. The Battle Sword and the battle axe kept colliding with each other, sending sparks flying in all directions. It was as if a storm was blowing in the air.</p><p>The entire audience was silent as they watched without blinking.</p><p>Many people were already numb to Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>Could it be that even a great saint could not take down Lu Ming?</p><p>Could it be that a stronger expert was needed? That would be really embarrassing.</p><p>The sect master’s face turned even gloomier. The great saint weapon in Lu Ming’s hand belonged to the divine Son. He had given it to the divine Son. Now, it was in Lu Ming’s hands and had become his weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming and the burly elder clashed head-on. They exchanged dozens of moves in an instant.</p><p>The more the burly old man fought, the more shocked and anxious he became.</p><p>A great saint had attacked a young man in the initial bright Saint realm, and in a head-on battle, he had actually failed to take him down. This had never happened before in the history of the Azure continent.</p><p>His attacks became more and more violent.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming exchanged another blow with his opponent and retreated. At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned pitch-black, like two deep pools, unfathomable.</p><p>At that moment, the burly elder seemed to have realized that Lu Ming had disappeared. Between heaven and earth, giant Dragons pounced toward him.</p><p>“Illusion, break!”</p><p>The burly old man roared. The soul in his sea of consciousness shone, and the battle-axe in his hand swept out, destroying everything.</p><p>This technique was the soul illusion technique, which he had obtained from Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After casting the soul illusion, Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the burly elder.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The people who were watching the battle, especially those from the sky demon sect, were shocked.</p><p>They saw that the burly old man suddenly slashed wildly at the air. Lu Ming’s body was approaching at high speed, but the other party did not seem to have any reaction.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s sword was aimed at the burly elder.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, the burly old man roared. He seemed to sense the danger and swung his battle axe at Lu Ming. The axe hit the combat sword and blocked Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>“It seems that my soul power is not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Due to the fusion of the main body and the secondary body, Lu Ming’s soul force had skyrocketed and was now equivalent to the soul force of a great sage initial mastery. However, the other party was also a great sage initial mastery and his soul force was not weaker than his. Although Lu Ming had cast the soul illusion technique to make the other party hallucinate, the other party could still feel it when he was faced with a fatal blow.</p><p>Just like at the treasure auction, Qiu Ying Ying’s soul power was far above the other party’s, but the other party could not feel it at all and was completely trapped in the illusion.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than a hundred holy weapons, all of which were offensive, flew towards the burly elder. At the same time, he stepped forward and attacked the burly elder.</p><p>The burly old man roared. He kept swinging his battle-ax, bringing with it a violent wind that swept in all directions. Lu Ming could not get close.</p><p>do you think this will work? suppress!</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the Tai Chi formation disk appeared, filled with endless runes.</p><p>A Tai Chi pattern appeared and pressed down on the burly old man.</p><p>The Tai Chi formation disk was mysterious and powerful. As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the power it could unleash became stronger as well.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Tai Chi pattern pressed down on the burly old man. The Tai Chi pattern contained the power of destruction and sealing. The burly old man’s body trembled and he retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming arrived and slashed down with his sword, cutting the burly elder into two.</p><p>However, as a Supreme Saint, he wouldn’t die even if he was cut in half. The elder’s body, which had been cut in half, retreated frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming chased after him relentlessly, wanting to kill him.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect waved his hand, and his Saint energy wrapped around the elder like a ribbon, pulling him behind him.</p><p>The burly elder broke away from the range of Lu Ming’s illusion. The two halves of his body connected together and recovered rapidly. He looked at Lu Ming with lingering fear.</p><p>He was almost killed by Lu Ming just now.</p><p>Many people trembled in their hearts. Lu Ming had almost killed a great saint with his cultivation at the initial bright Saint realm.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If the bright Saint can’t do it, then the great saint can. Now that the great saint can’t do it, are you, an absolute Saint, going to make a move?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the sect master of the sky demon sect and mocked.</p><p>He hated the sect master of the sky demon sect to the core and wanted to kill him immediately. He actually gave Xie nianqing to evil Spirit’s Dharma King to possess him.</p><p>She had probably planned this since Xie nianqing joined the Tian Yu demon sect and was accepted as her disciple.</p><p>how dare you, Lu Ming! This is the Tian Yu demon sect. How can you act so atrociously here? alright, now hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect spoke indifferently and changed the topic to Emperor Cang’s treasure.</p><p>“There’s no hurry. I’ll let you see a person first!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, he made a grabbing motion in the air, and the mo Yang appeared in his hand.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Yang was still unconscious in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Yang ‘er, what did you do to him?”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect’s expression changed slightly as he berated.</p><p>it’s nothing much. This guy was chasing after a disciple of my Dragon God Valley. I happened to run into him, so I knocked him out and brought him here!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Now, give me yang ‘er!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect spoke in a commanding tone.</p><p>I can give it to you, but you have to give me nianqing first. We’ll each exchange one person. That’s fair!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>in exchange for nianqing? what a joke. Nianqing is my disciple, so how could I exchange another disciple for this disciple? ”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect immediately rejected.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression did not change. He had long guessed this outcome.</p><p>The other party wanted to use Xie nianqing to let evil Spirit’s Shakyamuni possess him. Why would he trade for Mo Yang?</p><p>“So you’re not exchanging? I’ve searched Mo Yang’s soul before, and I discovered a shocking secret in his memories!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect’s expression changed. His eyes turned even more sinister as he glared at Lu Ming.”Don’t lie to me, no one can search yang ‘er’s soul!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
