They can’t do anything to you if you stay in Phoenix Palace!”</p><p>Huang Ling caught up to Lu Ming and asked worriedly.</p><p>...</p><p>it’s fine. My cultivation is about to break through. I might be able to fight!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After such a long period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was already very close to the upper tier of the bright Saint realm. He would be able to enter the upper tier of the bright Saint realm in a short period of time.</p><p>Once he entered the great mastery of the bright Saint realm, his combat strength would increase by another level.</p><p>This was the reason why he had suggested a battle a month later. A month was enough for him to break through.</p><p>Oh, I see. Lu Ming, I’ll bring you to a place that might give you a better chance in a month! Lu Ming said.</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“What place?”</p><p>the divine power Jade wall is a sacred cultivation ground in the Phoenix Palace. It can help people cultivate divine powers, but everyone only has one chance in their lives. It depends on one’s comprehension. The higher one’s comprehension is, the greater the harvest!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Divine ability Jade wall?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Then, Huang Ling brought Lu Ming to a huge cave.</p><p>The entrance of the cave was guarded by experts from the Phoenix Palace. However, the palace Master of the Phoenix Palace had once said that Lu Ming could enter some sacred grounds to cultivate. Naturally, there were no obstacles and he entered smoothly.</p><p>Inside the cave was a huge stone room. On one side of the stone room was a huge Jade wall that was more than a hundred meters in length and width.</p><p>The Jade wall was as smooth as a mirror and could reflect a person’s image.</p><p>“This is the divine ability Jade wall. Lu Ming, use your divine ability and bombard this Jade wall. That’ll do!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sat down cross-legged. He activated the chaos finger of tribulation and pointed at the abhijna Jade with one finger.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hold back. Huang Ling had told him very clearly that this divine power Jade wall was extremely wondrous. No divine power could damage the Jade wall at all.</p><p>As expected, when the chaos tribulation finger touched the divine ability Jade wall, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. It disappeared immediately. In the next moment, Lu Ming realized that the divine ability Jade wall was emitting a dazzling radiance. It was as if a terrifying force was acting on Lu Ming’s body, pulling him towards the Jade wall.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body sank into the Jade wall and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to have passed through layers of void and arrived in the universe.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the starry sky rumbled. A huge finger formed. It was shrouded in the color of chaos and was larger than a star. It pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Primal Chaos tribulation finger!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. However, the chaos finger tribulation was too powerful and mysterious. It was tens or even hundreds of times more powerful than the one Lu Ming had cast.</p><p>it can actually increase the power of my Divine Art by so many times. Amazing, truly amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart, his eyes fixed on the finger of calamity of chaos.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaos tribulation finger landed on Lu Ming’s body. There was a loud explosion in his mind. It was as if a huge chaos tribulation finger had appeared in his mind.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but close his eyes and focus on comprehending the chaos finger of calamity.</p><p>Time flew by, day after day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, 25 days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and realized that he was still sitting cross-legged on the abhijna Jade wall. Beside him, Huang Ling was also sitting there, clearly waiting for him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re awake. I didn’t expect that you would be able to comprehend it for twenty-five days!”</p><p>Huang Ling blinked her eyes in surprise.</p><p>“Has it been 25 days?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“That’s right. Other people usually wake up within ten days when they come to the divine ability Jade wall. I only woke up within twenty days. I didn’t expect you to wake up five more days than me. How is it? how’s the effect?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>not bad. Furthermore, I’ve also made a breakthrough in my cultivation without realizing it!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He realized that while he was quietly comprehending the chaos finger tribulation, he had made a breakthrough and reached the great mastery of the bright Saint stage.</p><p>the true divine power Jade wall is truly wondrous. It’s a pity that one only has one chance in his life!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>&Nbsp; after 25 days of comprehension, his Primal Chaos tribulation finger had increased from 18% to 33%, a full 15%.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to improve a sacred art. It required a lot of time to understand it, especially in the later stages.</p><p>Many of the older generation and absolute Saints would take thousands or even tens of thousands of years to increase their cultivation by 10%.</p><p>As for the primal Chaos tribulation finger, it was even more difficult to level it up. It was several times more difficult than ordinary divine power techniques with nomological laws as the foundation.</p><p>It would save Lu Ming a lot of time if he could increase the level by 15%.</p><p>However, everyone only had one chance to use the divine power Jade wall. It would be ineffective the second time. Otherwise, it would be heaven-defying.</p><p>“Are you confident in dealing with the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and the ten thousand celestial soldiers?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>“Why are you so concerned about me?” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>you’re my friend. Of course I care. Huang Ling’s face turned red.</p><p>Then, he walked out.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and followed Huang Ling out of the cave. He then returned to his residence. There were still five days left for him to consolidate his cultivation and cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>With the increase in his cultivation, he could seal even more Saint weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a great holy weapon and started to seal it.</p><p>In a secret chamber of the WAN family, Wan tianbing was also sealing his Saint weapon.</p><p>The only difference was that he wasn’t sealing a great saint weapon, but an absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>His entire body glowed, and a spot of light was extremely resplendent. Beside him, an old man sat cross-legged, emitting a terrifying aura. This person was an Emperor-level expert.</p><p>An absolute Saint weapon floated in the elder’s hand. He was helping the ten thousand celestial soldiers seal the weapon.</p><p>The celestial soldiers couldn’t seal an absolute Saint weapon at all. Their bodies would be torn apart by the weapon Qi, but with the help of an Emperor, it was a different story.</p><p>Emperor-level experts could help him consolidate his acupoints and help him seal ultimate holy weapons.</p><p>Two days later, the ten-thousand celestial weapon was successfully sealed into a holy weapon.</p><p>although I’ve successfully sealed the divine weapon for you, the absolute Saint weapon is too powerful. You can’t use it for too long, or it’ll be harmful to your body. You have to use it carefully!</p><p>The Emperor level old man instructed.</p><p>“Yes, ancestor!”</p><p>Wan tianbing bowed and acknowledged, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was dead for sure this time. He had no chance at all.</p><p>At the same time, the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow was also undergoing some sort of secret training.</p><p>This time, the news of Lu Ming’s battle with the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing had spread throughout the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>The cause and effect had also been dug out by people, and the news was spreading like wildfire. Many people were paying attention to it.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art.</p><p>Lu Ming had stripped the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow of all his feathers.</p><p>This was the cause of the conflict. Therefore, the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan paid special attention to this. They could only win, they could not lose!</p><p>A few days later, the appointed day arrived.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
