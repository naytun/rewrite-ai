It was only a few dozen meters tall before, but now it was a hundred meters tall. The Halo had also disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>After the Halo disappeared, the fragrance of the elixir pill also slowly faded.</p><p>the great Yan elixir Palace is most likely underground. Watch me break it!</p><p>A burly man stepped out. He gave off a terrifying aura. He was an absolute Saint.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>This person’s palm was like a blade. As he struck out, a shocking blade radiance formed and slashed towards the hill, wanting to split it in half.</p><p>However, when the saber radiance hit the hill, a circle of light burst out from the hill. Under this light, the saber radiance collapsed instantly. The burly figure was hit by the light and his body shook violently. He spat out blood and retreated. His face was pale and filled with fear.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>Someone sneered.</p><p>There were so many people here, including many absolute Saints and even Emperor-to-be figures. How could they not have tried before, but they had all been injured and retreated?</p><p>That was why so many people were waiting here.</p><p>Everyone was deep in thought. The ancient Dayan elixir Palace was no small matter. It seemed that it would be almost impossible for external forces to break it open by itself.</p><p>“Uncle, thank you for leading the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming thanked the yellow-faced uncle. Then, he went to the side alone and sat cross-legged on a mountain peak, waiting quietly.</p><p>As time passed, there were more and more people here. At a glance, the sky was almost full of human figures.</p><p>Every once in a while, the hill would glow and grow bigger.</p><p>As the days passed, the hill grew bigger and bigger.</p><p>Half a month later, the hill had grown to a hundred thousand feet tall, towering into the clouds. It was surrounded by clouds and mist, just like a celestial mountain.</p><p>From a distance, it looked like a huge pill furnace that stood between heaven and earth.</p><p>And this wasn’t the end. The mountain of pill furnaces was still growing, and by the day, it would grow by a large margin.</p><p>Another half a month passed. Lu Ming had been here for a month. The mountain of the alchemy furnace had already reached a height of more than a million feet. It was like a divine mountain, occupying a large area of territory.</p><p>“The mountain of pill furnaces is no longer growing!”</p><p>At this moment, someone spoke up. This was because the mountain of pill furnaces had not grown in size for three days.</p><p>Could it be that the mountain of pill furnaces had completely appeared?</p><p>Many people stared ahead with fiery eyes.</p><p>At this moment, a figure stepped out from the sky. This figure was shrouded in a terrifying divine light. His appearance could not be seen clearly, but he was emitting an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p>He stood high in the sky, but he gave people an illusion as if there was an entire world standing there. The shocking pressure made everyone’s expression change drastically, and their breathing became a little difficult.</p><p>“Wu… A Martial Emperor!”</p><p>Someone said, his voice extremely interfering.</p><p>An Emperor-ranked character had appeared.</p><p>How were they going to compete with a Martial Emperor?</p><p>However, this was only the beginning. After that, one figure after another appeared in the sky. These figures were all emitting divine light, like gods. It was as if there were worlds floating there.</p><p>Emperor-ranked powerhouses, they were all Emperor-ranked powerhouses.</p><p>Emperor-level experts had their Saint hearts condensed into a small world and had the power of the world. Just by standing there, they were like a world.</p><p>There were more than a dozen Emperor-level powerhouses standing in the sky. They dominated the area and gave off a terrifying pressure.</p><p>However, this was not the end. The number of Emperor-ranked powerhouses continued to increase. In the end, more than twenty Emperor-ranked powerhouses appeared.</p><p>Many people were flabbergasted. It had been many years since so many Emperor-ranked powerhouses had gathered. It was obvious that even Emperor-ranked powerhouses couldn’t remain calm when the great Yan elixir Palace appeared this time and had personally taken action.</p><p>Most likely, all of the powerful forces in ancient Moon Holy Land had Emperor-ranked figures.</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly shocked. As expected of ancient Moon Holy Land. More than twenty Emperor-level experts gathered together. How spectacular!</p><p>“You guys have all come out!”</p><p>let’s go! a deep voice came from the sky. It reverberated in the world and caused the void to rumble.</p><p>Emperor-ranked powerhouses could create small worlds, and every move they made contained the power of the world. They could destroy heaven and earth, and their power was unimaginable. Even when they spoke, if they didn’t suppress it, they could still have terrifying power.</p><p>“How can 1 not come when the great Yan elixir Palace has appeared?”</p><p>“Same to you!”</p><p>In the sky, a few voices sounded.</p><p>Below, the others were completely silent, no one dared to speak. An Emperor-ranked character had appeared. If they dared to speak out and angered one of the Emperor-ranked characters, they would be dead with a single slap.</p><p>“Since you’re here, why aren’t you attacking?”</p><p>Said the tall and sturdy figure who had arrived first.</p><p>“No rush!”</p><p>Someone said indifferently.</p><p>“You guys are really cunning. You’re just waiting for someone else to take the lead. If you don’t make a move, then 1’11 do it!”</p><p>The burly figure said with a disdainful voice. Then, he took a step forward and rushed toward the furnace Mountain. In an instant, he had rushed into the mountain and was covered by the clouds.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the mountain trembled, and a Halo spread out, rushing toward the burly figure.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>A rumbling sound came from the mountain. Then, a shocking sword light shot up into the sky, as if it was going to split the world.</p><p>The vast sword power caused the expressions of everyone below the Emperor level to change.</p><p>Facing such power, anyone below the Emperor level would be like an ant, easily annihilated.</p><p>This was the power of an Emperor-ranked expert.</p><p>it’s the martial sovereign of the wilderness sword sect!</p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p>However, the result was beyond everyone’s expectations. The sword light that could destroy heaven and earth did not destroy the Halo.</p><p>As the Halo rushed past, the sword light shattered and the sound of the sword resounded through the world. Then, a burly figure retreated rapidly out of the range of the mountain. The divine light on his body trembled a little and revealed his true appearance.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man with a sword on his back. However, his face was pale.</p><p>“There’s a terrifying formation in the mountain!”</p><p>The middle-aged man said with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“It seems that you can’t do it. Let me do it!”</p><p>A cold and arrogant voice was heard. Then, a figure covered in golden flames stepped out.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>With a screech, the figure transformed into a three-legged golden Crow. It was extremely huge, like a sun in the sky.</p><p>This was an Emperor-level expert from the three-legged golden Crow race, powerful and terrifying.</p><p>The three-legged golden Crow flapped his wings and his huge body turned into a golden light and rushed into the mountain.</p><p>However, his result was the same as the martial sovereign from the wilderness sword sect. He was also sent flying by the Halo, which made him extremely unhappy.</p><p>Following that, other Emperor-ranked powerhouses also tried, but the result was the same. They were all sent flying.</p><p>1 suggest that we join forces. It’s difficult to enter alone!</p><p>A cold voice sounded out. This person was extremely terrifying and gave off an incredibly sharp aura. There seemed to be countless weapons flying around him, and each weapon gave off terrifying power.</p><p>This person was an Emperor-level expert from the WAN clan.</p><p>“That’s right. Let’s work together and break this formation!”</p><p>The other Emperor level expert nodded..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
