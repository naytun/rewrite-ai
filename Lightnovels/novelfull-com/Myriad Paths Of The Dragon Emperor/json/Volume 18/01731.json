Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. He held the reincarnation halberd with both hands and slashed forward.</p><p>...</p><p>This attack was aimed at an extremely powerful absolute Saint. This person’s combat power wasn’t much weaker than the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>If he wanted to kill, he had to kill the strongest.</p><p>The reincarnation halberd was like the halberd of the heavenly God. As it slashed down, there was no way to stop it.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The absolute Saint let out an unwilling roar, and his body was turned into ashes by the reincarnation halberd. Nothing was left.</p><p>The other four absolute Saints were shocked. They didn’t dare to stay any longer. They all retreated frantically, afraid that Lu Ming would kill them with his halberd.</p><p>There was a look of pity in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The energy was used up.</p><p>There were two streams of energy in the halberd. The one that had been used earlier had been used up, especially to kill an absolute Saint.</p><p>Now, there was only one energy left in the halberd.</p><p>However, there were still ten absolute Saints. Even if he used the last bit of energy, he wouldn’t be able to kill all of them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming only hesitated for a moment before he stepped forward with the reincarnation halberd in his hand.</p><p>He didn’t release that burst of energy. That energy was to be used at a critical moment.</p><p>However, the others did not know that Lu Ming had no energy left. When they saw Lu Ming approaching, they were scared out of their wits and retreated continuously.</p><p>“Hahaha, kill!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch laughed heartily. Together with the cloud Dragon Valley master, they followed Lu Ming and charged forward. Wherever they passed, the evil spirit cultivators, regardless of their cultivation levels, all retreated frantically.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. No matter what cultivation level they were at, they would be killed in one strike with the halberd in his hand. It was the same even for absolute Saints. They were completely undefeatable. Whoever went up against them would die.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming walked toward the sect master of the sky demon sect. The sect master’s expression changed. He used all his strength to force his opponent back and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Why are you retreating? didn’t you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and glared at the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect glared at Lu Ming coldly. She wanted nothing more than to cut him into pieces. However, she did not dare to fight, afraid that Lu Ming would kill her with his halberd.</p><p>“Gather, gather!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect roared, and the experts from evil spirit started to gather together.</p><p>There were ten absolute Saints standing at the forefront, and their combined auras were earth-shattering.</p><p>However, Lu Ming held the reincarnation halberd and stepped forward.</p><p>The other party was shocked and retreated.</p><p>One man and one halberd forced the ten absolute Saints and many other great beings to step back.</p><p>This scene was so shocking that many people would never forget it for the rest of their lives.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re just relying on external items. I can kill you with one slap if I rely on my real abilities!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, relying on external items? How laughable, how many years have you been cultivating? How old are you? If you were the same age as me, I could blow you to death with a single breath!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud, his laughter filled with disdain.</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect had an ugly expression on his face, but he could not refute.</p><p>you’ll die sooner or later if you stop evil spirit. No one can stop evil spirit from rising. Let’s go!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect and the others slowly retreated.</p><p>“Old hag, you don’t want your disciple anymore?”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the mo Yang sword and continued, ” I forgot to tell you. I did search Mo Yang’s soul. However, his soul was destroyed by the power of the restriction. Now, he has become an idiot!</p><p>“What? “Ah!” You … You dare to trick me!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect shrieked, his face contorted in anger.</p><p>She knew that she had been deceived by Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had said that he would search Mo Yang’s soul in public and project the image. However, that was completely fake. He was lying to her. His purpose was to trick her into taking action.</p><p>Otherwise, she could have used the power of the tianshen sect and the other sects to destroy Dragon God Valley first, then the demon Castle and the life-and-death Sword sect. Finally, she could have laid a trap and suddenly attacked the tianshen sect and the other sects. In that way, the Azure region would have fallen completely into their control.</p><p>Moreover, the blood demon master could also successfully possess the body, and everything would be perfect.</p><p>But now, everything had changed.</p><p>It was because of Lu Ming that she was tricked into making a move in advance. Everything had changed because of this.</p><p>At that moment, the sect master’s face was twisted like a demon.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect roared and turned to leave. The rest of the evil spirit cultivators also retreated and disappeared.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and company did not pursue. They were already at a disadvantage, so even if they pursued, they would not be able to keep the other party.</p><p>At this moment, the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others looked at the sect master of the tianshen sect with an unfriendly expression.</p><p>The expression of the sect master of the heavenly God sect changed drastically. His figure flashed and retreated to the distance, ” “What do you want? The first thing we have to deal with now is evil spirit. If we have an internal conflict, evil spirit will only become the dominant force!”</p><p>“Hehe, what’s the rush? We didn’t say we were going to kill you!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sneered.</p><p>Then, the cloud Dragon Valley master looked around and said, ” everyone, let’s go back and inform the other sects in the Azure continent to join forces to find the lair of evil spirit and destroy them in one fell swoop. What do you think? ”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>The Lord of Demon Castle said. His huge eyes swept across the experts of jiuxiao sword sect and evil moon sect. “What do you all think?”</p><p>annihilating evil spirit is our top priority. I have the same intention!</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect leader said.</p><p>Then, the sect master of the evil moon sect also nodded.</p><p>In the end, everyone’s eyes turned to the sect master of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>my heavenly God sect will naturally fight to annihilate evil spirit cult!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>“Alright, it’s decided then!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others nodded.</p><p>“Farewell!”</p><p>After the sect master of the heavenly God sect finished speaking, he left with the remaining people of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>In this battle, the Tian Shen sect had suffered heavy losses. An absolute Saint had died, and the other experts had also suffered heavy losses. Their strength had been greatly reduced.</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect and the evil moon sect were slightly better off. Their absolute Saints didn’t die, but they had also lost many powerful figures of other levels.</p><p>“Everyone, farewell. We’ll meet again in the future!”</p><p>The sect leader of the jiuxiao sword sect also left with his sect members, and so did the evil moon sect.</p><p>In an instant, apart from the corpses strewn all over the ground, only Lu Ming and a few others were left in the huge sky demon sect.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to Xie nianqing’s side. Xie nianqing was still sitting cross-legged, but there was a demonic aura around her.</p><p>“This little girl is about to break through to the Saint realm!”</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch appeared beside Lu Ming and said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>the few of you, return to your respective sects first. Join forces with the other sects in the Cang region and make arrangements to annihilate evil spirit. Lu Ming and I will stay here and wait for this girl to break through!</p><p>The Ice Dragon patriarch said to the Ice Dragon Valley master, the life and death Sword sect master, and the others.</p><p>Everyone nodded. In the end, the cloud Dragon Valley master also stayed, while the life and death Sword sect master, Demon castle’s Castle Master, and ice Dragon Valley master left and returned to their respective sects to begin planning the annihilation of evil spirit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
