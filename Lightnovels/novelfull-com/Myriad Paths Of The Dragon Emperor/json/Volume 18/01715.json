The greed in their eyes grew even stronger.</p><p>Indeed, they had thought of this as well. The opportunities that Lu Ming obtained most likely did not only belong to Emperor Cang. There might be even greater opportunities. Otherwise, he would not be so powerful.</p><p>...</p><p>They had to get it.</p><p>what should we do now? this brat’s soul power is too strong. Ordinary people can’t resist his soul attack!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect frowned.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, an old man in white robe stepped out from the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>This old man was very old. His hair was almost all gone, and the wrinkles on his face were like mountains.</p><p>“Elder mo kong, I’m relieved that you’re going!”</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect revealed a happy expression.</p><p>“So it’s senior mo kong!”</p><p>The sect Masters of the desire poison sect and the sky demon sect both had their eyes lit up.</p><p>Mo kong was a very senior Saint. He was one or two times older than the other sect leaders and had cultivated for more than 100000 years. However, due to his limited talent, he had been stuck in the bright Saint realm all his life.</p><p>However, mo Kong’s power could not be denied. After living for so long, who knew what tricks he had up his sleeve?</p><p>Moreover, one thing was for sure. After living for such a long time, his soul force must have reached an astonishing level. He did not need to be afraid of Lu Ming’s soul attack.</p><p>Mo kong smiled and stepped forward to Lu Ming.</p><p>little fellow, I will not show any mercy when I attack. Why don’t you obediently hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures? I can spare your life!</p><p>Mo kong said. His voice was very old, and his muddy eyes looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He was highly focused. He would not let his guard down just because the other party was old.</p><p>In fact, at the level of the Saint realm, the older one was, the more terrifying they were.</p><p>“Little fellow’s heart is higher than the sky, then this old man will grind down your spirit!”</p><p>At that moment, mo Kong’s murky eyes were no longer murky. Instead, they shone with a shocking light. Brilliant Saint light emanated from his body. It was shocking.</p><p>“Divine ability. [ holy light cut ]!”</p><p>Mo kong said in a low voice. He waved his hand casually, and the endless holy light turned into extremely sharp ribbons. These ribbons were very long and swept through the void. They seemed to have suddenly appeared around Lu Ming’s body and enveloped him.</p><p>“Not good, it’s a divine ability. Be careful!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s expression changed as he cried out in alarm.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect and the others were ecstatic.</p><p>Mo kong had actually cultivated a Divine Art. He was indeed an old monster who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p>It was difficult for ordinary people in the bright Saint realm to successfully cultivate the divine power Technique unless they were peerless geniuses.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to cultivate, but its power was also extremely shocking.</p><p>Those who had cultivated a sacred art could easily kill those of the same level who had not.</p><p>The terrifying ribbon of holy light enveloped Lu Ming. The edge of the ribbon was extremely sharp and seemed to be able to cut through everything.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. A few electric lights lit up on his body and two holy weapon shields flew out, blocking the front and back of him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>When the ribbons of holy light struck the shield, a shocking scene occurred. The shield was immediately covered in cracks. If this continued, the shield would be cut open very soon.</p><p>What a terrifying cutting power. Even a holy weapon would be cut open.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect and the others smiled. They were sure to win. Once the magical power was used, there was no doubt that Lu Ming would not be a match.</p><p>The valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley paid full attention to the situation. If Lu Ming was in danger, they would do their best to save him.</p><p>The others all held their breath and stared at the scene.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, this kid, has no chance!”</p><p>Yin Zheng’s eyes were filled with joy.</p><p>Mo kong was in the great circle of the bright Saint stage and had cultivated a sacred art. He was almost invincible in the bright Saint stage, at least in the Azure continent.</p><p>“Spells are indeed powerful. I wonder how much this old man has cultivated it. I don’t think it’s too high!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>A chaos sky-turning seal appeared in Lu Ming’s palm and he smashed it at the Holy Light ribbons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Holy Light ribbon trembled violently, but it cut the chaos sky-turning stamp even more intensely.</p><p>With an ear-piercing sound, the chaos sky-turning seal was actually cut into deep ravines. Finally, with a bang, it exploded.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, the chaos sky-turning seal was formed continuously and blasted at the Holy Light ribbons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The chaos sky-turning stamp kept colliding with the Holy Light ribbons, and terrible rumbles kept sounding.</p><p>“It’s useless. You can’t break my Divine Art!”</p><p>Mo kong said, but his eyes were solemn. He kept waving his hands, and more holy light ribbons appeared. They danced and completely enveloped Lu Ming like a cocoon.</p><p>From the outside, one could see that some parts of the cocoon were constantly bulging, as if something was about to rush out from inside.</p><p>From inside, the sound of explosions could be heard.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few minutes had passed, but the vibration of the ribbon continued to ring out.</p><p>he’s still resisting. This kid’s combat strength is really amazing!</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect said. Even an Overlord like him was shocked.</p><p>“I must get rid of this brat after I obtain his secret. Otherwise, I’ll be in endless trouble!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said coldly.</p><p>The sect leaders of the other two sects nodded. Indeed, Lu Ming already had such combat power now. If he reached the absolute Saint realm in the future, who in the Azure continent would be his match?</p><p>magical powers are indeed mysterious and powerful. However, I can only use 10% of it at most!</p><p>In the Holy Light ribbon, Lu Ming’s expression was very calm. He was just testing the waters.</p><p>This was the first time he was going up against a magical power Technique, so he naturally had to study it carefully.</p><p>That was because he could now cultivate super power techniques. In the chaos Scripture, there was a terrifying super power Technique called the chaos tribulation finger, which could exert the power of the chaos laws to the extreme.</p><p>In addition, there were also divine abilities in the memories of the nine Dragons.</p><p>This was the direction of his future cultivation.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>In his dantian, the two Saint hearts glowed and started to spin crazily. The Saint power in his body surged.</p><p>The Laws of Chaos circulated all over his body. Lu Ming threw a punch at the Holy Light ribbon, and a huge prison-suppressing stele appeared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Holy Light ribbons trembled wildly, then exploded with loud bangs.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Holy Light ribbons were all destroyed. Lu Ming’s slender figure reappeared in front of everyone.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Mo kong roared and spat out a mouthful of blood. He was forced to retreat. His old eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>His divine power Technique was actually broken by Lu Ming.</p><p>How could a junior who had just broken through to the bright Saint realm break through his sacred art?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
