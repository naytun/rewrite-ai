I wonder what’s the difference between its skin and that of a human!</p><p>...</p><p>Wan tianbing laughed and took a step forward, appearing beside Xue ningxin. He raised his hand and was about to touch her.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xue ningxin roared and moved back.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Wan tianbing swung his hand and slapped Xue ningxin’s face. He scolded,” b * tch, how dare you treat me with this kind of attitude. Tonight, I’ll make you beg for death!</p><p>Having said that, Wan tianbing even looked at Lu Ming provocatively.</p><p>…..</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. A cold killing intent spread out like a cold wave, causing the temperature of the entire Hall to drop sharply.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a prehistoric beast that could explode at any moment.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? Do you want to make a move?”</p><p>Wan Pingyang, Xu tuo, and the others also released their auras and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, many terrifying auras rose around the hall.</p><p>They were looking forward to Lu Ming taking action and taking the opportunity to kill him.</p><p>“Junior Brother, don’t!”</p><p>Xue ningxin looked at Lu Ming and shook her head vigorously.</p><p>so, she’s Lu Ming’s Senior Sister. Haha, I’ll be more excited when I play with her!</p><p>Wan tianbing stared at Xue ningxin with fiery eyes.</p><p>“Wan tianbing, you’ll die a horrible death, I promise!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his killing intent growing stronger.</p><p>Powerful auras also burst out from Phoenix spirit and Long Chen.</p><p>you dare to threaten me? do you believe that I won’t strip off this b * tch’s clothes right now?!</p><p>Wan tianbing stood beside Xue ningxin and condensed a blade of Saint power. With a slash, Xue ningxin’s clothes were torn apart.</p><p>bubble, you save her. I’ll… To kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>“Don’t worry, leave it to me!”</p><p>alright! paoba nodded, then opened her mouth and blew at Xue ningxin, causing a strange ripple in the air.</p><p>On the high platform, Xue ningxin’s figure suddenly fluctuated like a wave, and in the next moment, her figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p>how dare you Rob the thousand spirit exchange? you’re looking for death!</p><p>Wan Pingyang reacted and shouted.</p><p>“Today, not only are we going to intercept people, but we’re also going to kill them. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. When he shouted the last word,’kill’, two terrifying sword gleams shot out from his eyes and rushed into Wan tianbing’s body.</p><p>“All!”</p><p>ah! Wan tianbing immediately let out a shrill scream. He held his head with both hands, and his face was twisted in extreme pain.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella was glowing. It was due to the fluctuation of his soul force. The terrifying power kept surging into Wan tianbing’s mind and attacking his soul.</p><p>Lu Ming did not tear Wan tianbing’s soul at once as that would be letting him off too easily. Lu Ming wanted to tear his soul slowly and make him suffer so much that he would rather die.</p><p>The pain of the soul was ten times or even a hundred times stronger than the pain of the body.</p><p>Wan tianbing screamed crazily and rolled on the ground, holding his head and hitting it hard.</p><p>“You’re looking for death, stop it!”</p><p>On the high platform, an old man shouted.</p><p>“You all have to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He took a step forward and rushed into the fighting ring like a bolt of lightning. His body glowed as holy weapons appeared one after another. The absolute holy weapon, the sword, was in his hand.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The old man roared and threw a punch at Lu Ming. This old man was an expert in the great sage realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his sword and collided with the elder’s fist force. The terrifying power caused the elder’s body to shake violently and he retreated frantically.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming landed on the high platform and took a few steps forward. Dense runes spread out and crawled toward the two elders, covering their bodies in an instant.</p><p>The sealing art could seal all living things, and it was about to seal the cultivation of the two old men.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The two elders were shocked. They unleashed their powers but it was too late. Lu Ming dashed past them and his sword streaked across the sky. Two heads flew high into the air. The destructive sword Qi had already destroyed their souls.</p><p>The two great sage accomplished experts were killed by Lu Ming in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang, Xu tuo, and the others roared and attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>Among these young men, three of them had reached the Supreme Saint realm. They were all terrifying geniuses with powerful combat strength. Now that they had joined forces, their power was astonishing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, a terrifying aura burst out from the hall. Then, one figure after another rushed out and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>die! Long Chen shouted and rushed to the right. His body swelled up, especially his arms, which were several times larger. With a loud boom, he punched out dozens of times. The space shook violently, and the terrifying fist force was thrown at the experts who were charging at him.</p><p>These experts were almost all great saints. There were more than ten of them.</p><p>However, Long Chen had broken through to the Supreme Saint realm. With his spiritual body and the Supreme rule, his combat strength was amazing. He blocked more than ten strong cultivators at once.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Ling rushed to the left. She was bathed in the unperishable flame. A huge Phoenix formed and rushed towards the experts, blocking them for a moment.</p><p>However, there were more experts coming from the front. There were more than a dozen of them. They were all old men with white hair and shocking aura. There were great saints at the peak and even great saints in the Great Perfection realm.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, leave it to me!”</p><p>Paopao flew out and took a deep breath before exhaling.</p><p>Beep, beep, beep…</p><p>Bubbles were spat out from bubbles ‘small mouth and flew out.</p><p>The dozen or so elders were all enveloped by the transparent bubble in an instant.</p><p>“All, what’s going on?”</p><p>An old man shouted in horror. His already old body was aging rapidly. The White hair on his head began to fall off, and his skin began to dry up.</p><p>Then, the qi and blood in their bodies began to weaken.</p><p>time law, it’s time law. Time is passing by quickly!</p><p>An old man roared as he struggled madly.</p><p>After bubbles broke through to the Supreme Saint realm, her space-time laws became even more terrifying. She could even accelerate the flow of time or reverse time.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Next, bubbles waved her small hand, causing the space to ripple and form many terrifying spatial blades that slashed out.</p><p>Instantly, the bodies of the elders were split apart and they died here.</p><p>Lu Ming made his move at the same time as bubbles. He pointed his finger and the chaos finger of tribulation burst forth. A huge finger pointed at Wan Pingyang.</p><p>…..</p><p>Over the past few months, Lu Ming’s chaotic finger of tribulation had improved again. It had reached 53%. At this moment, when it was fully unleashed, its power was shocking.</p><p>The Saint weapons surrounding Wan Pingyang were all sent flying. His body was stopped by the primal Chaos finger of tribulation, and he crashed into the wall of the hall. The wall shattered, and Wan Pingyang fell to the ground like a pile of mud. He was already half dead.</p><p>He had severely injured Wan Pingyang in one move..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
