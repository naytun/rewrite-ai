Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three of them climbed up step by step. With every step they took, the Jade stairs made a clattering sound.</p><p>...</p><p>The cries of phoenixes kept coming out from the three of them. Huang Ling was completely bathed in the immortal Flames, as if she was about to turn into an immortal Phoenix.</p><p>Gradually, Huang Ling started to take the lead and surpassed Huang Bing and Huang Kong.</p><p>This made Huang Bing and Huang Kong’s faces extremely gloomy.</p><p>The two of them were unwilling. Were they going to lose to Huang Ling? the heart of the parasol tree was going to be taken by Huang Ling?</p><p>They were well aware of this mission. It was also a test for them by the higher-ups of the Phoenix Palace, and the palace Master would pay attention to it. Whoever won would be more important than the other Holy Sons and Holy daughters, and would receive more resources in the future. Only then would they have the capital to challenge the stronger Holy Sons and holy virgins.</p><p>A powerful force like the Phoenix Palace had too many paragons. There were saintesses and Sons in every generation.</p><p>How many heaven’s favorites are there?</p><p>If he wanted to stand at the top and compete for the position of the Phoenix Palace Master, he had to suppress all the other paragons.</p><p>Now, if the seven bright Saints still couldn’t win, they were destined to be reduced to mere sidekicks in the future. They couldn’t compete for the position of Palace Master.</p><p>Unless he could obtain a heaven-defying opportunity later on.</p><p>Time passed by slowly. Huang Ling’s advantage became more and more obvious, and she was getting closer and closer to the peak.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow, Wan Tianlong, Huang Jian, and the other top talents all looked pale.</p><p>After all, they were Huang Kong and Huang Bing had invited them to help them. Naturally, they wanted to help them win the first place. This way, they would have some face.</p><p>Huang Kong and Huang Bing looked at each other, and a trace of ruthlessness flashed in their eyes.</p><p>let’s join forces. Let’s knock the Phoenix Spirit down first before we fight for it. How about it? ”</p><p>Huang Kong sent a message to Huang Bing.</p><p>alright, that’s what I was thinking. I’ll send a message to Huang Jian and the others!</p><p>Huang Bing nodded and sent a message to Huang Jian and the Golden Crow Prince. She planned to team up with Huang Kong to deal with Huang Ling first.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Kong also sent a message to the three people he had invited.</p><p>The eyes of the ninth golden Crow Prince lit up and flashed with cold killing intent.</p><p>Beside Huang Kong, Wan Tianlong and the rest also looked in Lu Ming’s direction and nodded silently.</p><p>Then, in a flash, six paragons charged toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>not good! Huang Kong and Huang Bing are working together. They have to deal with Huang Ling first!</p><p>Mu Qingxue cried out in alarm.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess the situation.</p><p>guard the Phoenix Spirit well. The two of you guard the left and right sides. I’ll guard the bottom!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He stood behind Huang Ling and looked down at the Golden Crow ninth Prince and the rest.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow glanced at Lu Ming. In the end, he did not dare to fight and pounced on Qin Feng.</p><p>The other heaven’s favorite charged towards mu Qingxue.</p><p>As for desolate sword, Wan Tianlong and the other three, they charged at Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was the strongest. As long as he got rid of Lu Ming first, the rest would be easy to handle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The desolate sword’s iron sword was unsheathed and it cut through the void, making a terrifying whistling sound as it slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Wan Tianlong’s body glowed with light as Saint weapons emerged one after another. There were a total of seventy-two Saint weapons, one of which was a great saint weapon. The Qi of battle weapons gathered together, and it was extremely powerful as it charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>However, what made Lu Ming’s eyes narrow was not Wan Tianlong, but another purple-robed youth. This person was actually the same as Huang Jian, also in the great circle of the bright Saint stage. He was extremely powerful, and with a single palm strike, a terrifying giant snake pounced towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Two in the great circle of the bright Saint stage and two in the peak of the bright Saint stage. The four of them joined forces and their power was terrifying. They wanted to obliterate Lu Ming.</p><p>When he was in the Azure continent, Lu Ming had tried his best.</p><p>However, that was only for ordinary Supreme Saints.</p><p>The four of them were not ordinary saints. They were all heaven’s favorites with heavenly spiritual bodies. Their super powers were more powerful and each of them could fight above their level.</p><p>For example, Huang Jian and the purple-robed youth might be in the great circle of the bright Saint stage, but their combat power was not weaker than that of the Azure continent’s great saint lower tier. In fact, they might even be stronger.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared and used the divine sword technique. Sword radiance shot out from his eyes continuously.</p><p>Huang Jian and the other three shuddered, but Huang Jian and the purple-robed young man recovered in an instant. They continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Only Wan Tianlong and the other person were more affected.</p><p>“What a powerful soul force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. These geniuses could not be judged by common sense. Not only were they powerful in combat, but their soul force was also stronger than ordinary people. Most of them had treasures that could defend their souls. Lu Ming’s divine sword technique did not have much of an effect on them.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the prison suppressing heaven technique and struck out a few times.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming destroyed the desolate sword’s sword radiance and the purple-robed youth’s attack, but his body could not help but sway.</p><p>But immediately after, Huang Jian and the others launched an even more violent attack, all of which were super powers.</p><p>“30% of the spell’s power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Both the desolate sword and the purple-robed young man’s supernatural powers had reached thirty percent. Their power was extremely terrifying and filled with destructive power.</p><p>On the other hand, although Wan Tianlong and his partner were slightly weaker, they posed a certain threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos finger!”</p><p>It was the first time Lu Ming used the chaos finger of tribulation. He pointed four fingers in a row.</p><p>Four giant fingers, the color of chaos and containing the power of destruction, pointed at the four people.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The four attacks were instantly destroyed. Huang Jian and the purple-robed young man trembled and took a few steps back.</p><p>As for Wan Tianlong and the other man, they were forced to retreat in a frenzy as they spat out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Although the primal Chaos tribulation finger was only 18% complete, its power was even stronger than 30% of the sacred art cultivated from the laws.</p><p>the law of chaos. Could he be the son of chaos? ”</p><p>Desolate sword’s eyes were filled with shock as he recognized Lu Ming’s law.</p><p>so what if he’s a son of chaos? he hasn’t grown up yet. I’ll Still Kill him!</p><p>The young man in purple robe shouted. Purple light burst forth as he waved his hands continuously. Huge purple snakes pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>the two of you, go and deal with Huang Ling. Leave Lu Ming to us!</p><p>Huang Jian said to Wan Tianlong and Wang Yan.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Wan Tianlong and Fang ping nodded, planning to circle around Lu Ming and charge at Huang Ling.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed as the space between his brows glowed. The Tai Chi disk array floated out, and the Tai Chi pattern emerged, turning into the Yin Yang fish sword. It charged at Wan Tianlong and Huang Jian, blocking their path. At the same time, he used the chaotic finger of calamity to fight Huang Jian and the purple-robed young man.</p><p>Lu Ming alone blocked the four paragons, preventing them from approaching the Phoenix Spirit.</p><p>The others were shocked, especially Huang Kong and Huang Bing, who could not calm down.</p><p>He had never seen Lu Ming before. Which force did he belong to? his combat strength was too terrifying. He was only at the initial bright Saint realm, but his combat strength was simply heaven-defying. He could actually fight against four great geniuses.</p><p>And the laws he controlled were suspected to be the legendary Laws of Chaos. Could it be that the son of chaos was really born?</p><p>Huang Ling actually knew such a genius?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
