He used all his strength and a huge chaos finger of tribulation shot towards the crowd.</p><p>Wherever the finger of Primal Chaos tribulation passed by, several great saint three-eyed gods would be killed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was like a god of death, slaughtering the three-eyed God race without restraint.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>kill him! the armored three-eyed God roared. If not for his severe injuries, he would have already killed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Surround him, surround him, surround him!”</p><p>…..</p><p>The three-eyed God wearing battle armor roared.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The remaining great saints of the three-eyed God race stepped into the void. With two of their peak great saints as the leaders, they formed an encirclement and rained down attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Prison suppression!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and pieces of the prison-suppressing stele appeared around him, crushing down on the three-eyed Celestials.</p><p>“Not good, it’s the prison-guarding stele, retreat!”</p><p>When the three-eyed God race members saw the prison-suppressing stele, they all screamed in fear as if they had seen something terrifying. They all backed away in a frenzy.</p><p>A total of nine prison-suppressing steles glowed and pressed down.</p><p>Nine shrieks were heard. The nine experts of great sage initial and great sage great mastery didn’t even have the courage to resist and were killed directly. “How can you have the prison-suppressing stele?”</p><p>The armored three-eyed God also had a look of fear in his eyes.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. These three-eyed gods were actually so afraid of the prison suppressing stele?</p><p>Without any hesitation, the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele appeared on his spine.</p><p>As soon as the fragment of the prison-guarding stele appeared, it quickly grew to the size of a mountain. The two words ‘prison’ and ‘stele’ were especially bright.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>&Nbsp; the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele shot toward the three-eyed God.</p><p>“Block it, join forces to block it!”</p><p>A Supreme Saint peak-level great being, together with seven or eight Supreme Saints from the three-eyed God race, launched a series of terrifying attacks in an attempt to stop the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele seemed to contain a special power that was effective against the three-eyed God race. When the three-eyed God race’s power hit the stele, it crumbled.</p><p>&Nbsp; the prison-suppressing stele crushed down, and the three-eyed gods screamed in pain as they exploded.</p><p>The only exception was the great saint at the peak who was still alive. However, he was also half-dead and was spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward and killed him with a single slash.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the prison-suppressing stele flew towards the armored three-eyed God.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the three-eyed God panicked and tried to escape, but it was useless. In an instant, the prison-suppressing stele caught up to him, and the light from the stele grew even brighter as it pressed down.</p><p>“So what if it’s the prison-suppressing stele? Get lost!”</p><p>The three-eyed God in armor roared as a beam of destructive light shot out from his forehead and slammed into the prison-suppressing stele, causing it to tremble.</p><p>However, the strange power on the prison-suppressing stele burst out and crushed down, causing the destructive light to collapse instantly.</p><p>“Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!”</p><p>The three-eyed God in armor roared as he continued to swing his axe at the prison-suppressing stele, causing it to tremble.</p><p>This three-eyed God was a great saint in the great circle. Even though he was heavily injured, his combat strength was still shocking. The prison-suppressing stele couldn’t kill him in a short time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was still there?</p><p>Lu Ming walked in the air and appeared not far away.</p><p>“Quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The three-eyed God was shocked.</p><p>But the other three-eyed God race members were scared to death when they saw the prison-guarding stele. None of them dared to come out, and they all ran away in a hurry.</p><p>“No one can save you!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming said coldly. He pointed a finger at the other party. The terrifying power made the other party roar in despair.</p><p>He tried his best to block the attack and kept swinging his axe. He finally managed to block the finger of tribulation of chaos, but he couldn’t stop the power of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>&Nbsp; the prison-suppressing stele crushed down, and with a roar of unwillingness, the three-eyed God was killed, his body torn to pieces.</p><p>By now, not a single one of the other three-eyed God race had escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t pursue them. He knew that he couldn’t kill all of the three-eyed gods on his own. There were so many of them, and they were all fleeing in different directions. It was impossible for him to catch up.</p><p>To be able to annihilate a large portion of the three-eyed God Army and kill their general was already an incredible feat.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the prison-suppressing stele and landed on the ground. He sat on the ground and panted heavily.</p><p>Just now, he had used the chaotic finger of tribulation with all his strength. He had used up a lot of Saint power, and his physical strength was not enough.</p><p>At this moment, a white light flashed in front of Lu Ming. The white-robed old man appeared.</p><p>“You’ve done well!”</p><p>The white-robed old man’s gaze swept across the scene and revealed a hint of admiration.</p><p>“Is this my test?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“That’s right, this is a test!” The white-robed old man nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming was silent. After a long while, he said,” “Then, are these all illusions? It’s all fake?”</p><p>“If you say it’s true, it’s true. If you say it’s false, it’s false!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said. His eyes were filled with reminiscence and sadness. He then continued, what you’ve experienced and seen during this period of time actually happened in the ancient times. Those people used to exist, but they all died in the hands of the alien tribes!</p><p>in ancient times, the alien races tore open the void and arrived. The heaven realm fell into chaos. Countless creatures were killed and billions of corpses were buried. It was a real river of blood. What you have experienced is just a projection of a place in ancient times!</p><p>Lu Ming was silent again. After a while, he asked,” “Is this considered a pass?”</p><p>“Not bad, you’ve passed!”</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>“If I don’t kill the general of the other side, will I not pass?” Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The white-robed old man shook his head and said,”it’s not that difficult. As long as you can kill your way to this camp, no matter what the result is, it won’t matter.” You’ve already passed, but your performance has exceeded my expectations!”</p><p>“Of course, if you don’t even dare to charge into this camp, then you’ve failed. Let me show you some images!”</p><p>The white-robed old man waved his hand, and images appeared in the air.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that the others were experiencing the same thing as him. They were also heavily injured and saved by Xia Hu. Then, they recuperated in the tribe. After that, the three-eyed God race attacked.</p><p>However, Lu Ming saw that someone was killed by the three-eyed God race instead of breaking the shackles and recovering his cultivation when the three-eyed God race attacked. At this moment, a white light enveloped him, and this person was eliminated.</p><p>There were also people who directly abandoned their tribes and fled by themselves. Similarly, they were enveloped by a ray of light and were also eliminated.</p><p>Someone broke through the shackles and killed all the three-eyed gods that had invaded. They rushed to the camp and fell silent for a moment before retreating. Those who didn’t plan on attacking the camp were also eliminated and teleported out..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
