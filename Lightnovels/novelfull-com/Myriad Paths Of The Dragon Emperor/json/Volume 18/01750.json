Her thoughts were the same as Lu Ming’s. There were Phoenix spirits everywhere in this place. There might be stronger ones in other places. They could only rush over.</p><p>If they couldn’t even get past this, how could they compete with the other Holy Sons and holy virgins?</p><p>...</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming said as he stepped forward. A powerful aura surged from his body. Then, his palm was like a knife as he slashed at the Phoenix Spirit’s sharp claws.</p><p>you’re only a lower tier bright Saint, yet you want to fight this Phoenix spirit head-on? you’re really ignorant. You’re looking for death!</p><p>In the distance, Qin Feng sneered.</p><p>But the next moment, his smile disappeared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm collided with the Phoenix’s sharp claws, but the result was that the Phoenix’s body was sent flying.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped forward. A huge chaos sky-turning seal condensed in his palm. It was as big as a mountain and pressed down on the Phoenix Spirit.</p><p>Although the chaos sky-turning seal was only a domain-level martial arts technique, it was still extremely terrifying when cast by Lu Ming with his current cultivation level.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The chaotic sky-turning seal pressed down on the Phoenix Spirit, causing its body to tremble and let out cries.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hands did not stop. Chaos sky-turning seals were constantly condensed and blasted at the Phoenix Spirit.</p><p>After five or six consecutive attacks, the Phoenix Spirit finally couldn’t take it anymore. It exploded with a bang and turned into black smoke.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Feng’s expression froze and then became extremely gloomy.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was so strong. He was only an initial bright Saint, but he could suppress the Phoenix’s spirit. Didn’t that mean that his combat strength was stronger than his?</p><p>Moreover, in his opinion, he was no match for the Phoenix Spirit just now. Now that Lu Ming could kill the Phoenix Spirit, was it not a slap to his face?</p><p>Especially in front of the two beauties, Huang Ling and mu Qingxue. This made his eyes flash with a cold light.</p><p>Huang Ling and mu Qingxue were also a little stunned.</p><p>this guy’s combat strength has become stronger!</p><p>Huang Ling muttered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside mu Qingxue to help her deal with the other Phoenix spirits. These Phoenix spirits were much weaker and were no match for Lu Ming. He killed them with one move and quickly cleared them all.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to bi Lin.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you mean? You’re obviously so strong, so why didn’t you attack just now? were you waiting for us to be unable to resist before you attacked so that you could show off your strength? You’re disregarding other people’s safety!”</p><p>Qin Feng flew back and scolded with a gloomy face.</p><p>“Weren’t you the one who told me not to make a move? Besides, the one who wanted to show off was you, right? of course I had to give you this chance. Unfortunately, I didn’t expect you to be a good-for-nothing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Qin Feng’s face turned even gloomier. Lu Ming actually dared to call him trash?</p><p>“Isn’t it? Also, I’ll borrow your words, trash, stand behind and don’t make a move, so you don’t get in the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and stepped forward.</p><p>Mu Qingxue let out a crisp laugh and gave Qin Feng a disdainful look. Then, she followed Lu Ming and walked forward with Feng Ling.</p><p>Qin Feng clenched his fists tightly, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming actually dared to humiliate him. He was just a person from the Azure continent, yet he dared to humiliate him, a heaven’s favorite from a Holy Land’s major force. He was simply courting death!</p><p>Qin Feng’s eyes darted around for a while, then he followed Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Following that, more Phoenix spirits appeared. However, with Lu Ming leading the way, these Phoenix spirits could not stop them at all. They rushed forward quickly.</p><p>Half an hour later, they had flown tens of thousands of miles. Finally, there were no more Phoenix spirits.</p><p>Without the appearance of the Phoenix’s spirit, their speed increased explosively. They turned into four streams of light and streaked across the sky.</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, a towering ancient tree appeared in their line of sight.</p><p>“Is that the ancient parasol tree? It’s actually rooted in the void!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with shock as he looked at the towering tree in front of him.</p><p>That ancient tree was too big. It blotted out the sky and the sun. No one knew how high it was. The most shocking thing was that the roots of the towering ancient tree were actually rooted in the void.</p><p>It was as if a towering ancient tree had grown out of the void. This scene was truly terrifying.</p><p>Huang Ling seemed to have known about this long ago, but mu Qingxue and Qin Feng were also a little dumbfounded.</p><p>that’s the ancient parasol tree. The heart of the parasol tree is right there. Let’s go!</p><p>Said Huang Ling as she flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, they slowly approached the ancient parasol tree. The closer they got, the more they felt that the ancient parasol tree was huge. It was as if it could support an entire world. They did not know how big it was.</p><p>Under the ancient parasol tree, there was a huge mountain. It was extremely majestic and pierced through the sky.</p><p>At the peak of the mountain, near the root of the ancient parasol tree.</p><p>When they arrived, they found that they could not fly up any further. They were obstructed by a powerful force.</p><p>“What’s going on? if we can’t fly up, how can we get on the ancient parasol tree?”</p><p>Mu Qingxue asked, puzzled.</p><p>that mountain goes straight to the root of the ancient parasol tree. Could it be from there? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling. The four of them flew forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, from several other directions, the sound of air breaking could be heard. There were also people flying towards the mountain.</p><p>“Huang Kong, Huang Bing, and Huang Xuan!”</p><p>Huang Ling said in a low voice.</p><p>In addition to them, there were three other Holy Sons and Holy Sons who had brought people here.</p><p>The four groups of people arrived in front of the mountain almost at the same time.</p><p>On the mountain, there was a Jade staircase that led from the foot of the mountain to the top.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, there was a stone tablet with a line of words written on it.</p><p>“If you want to climb up the Wutong tree, climb up from here!”</p><p>It was obvious that in order to step onto the ancient parasol tree, one had to climb the Jade ladder to the peak of the mountain and then obtain the heart of the parasol tree from the ancient parasol tree.</p><p>People from all four sides moved almost at the same time and rushed toward the Jade stairs.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed up the Jade stairs. With one step, his body was as light as a swallow, and he headed towards the mountain peak at top speed.</p><p>Qin Feng and mu Qingxue were the same. However, when Lu Ming swept his gaze across them, he realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Huang Ling’s body glowed as if she was under great pressure and was climbing up with great difficulty.</p><p>Not only him, but Huang Kong, Huang Bing, and Huang Xuan were also the same. They seemed to be under hundreds of millions of Jun of pressure, and it was extremely difficult for them to walk.</p><p>Other than the four of them, the others who came to help seemed to be very relaxed.</p><p>At this time, the others also noticed this strange scene and all stopped.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>this Jade staircase will form a powerful pressure on those who cultivate the Phoenix body!</p><p>Said Huang Kong.</p><p>it’s very likely that this was built by the Phoenix Clan in the distant past to test the younger phoenixes!</p><p>Huang Ling also spoke.</p><p>The eyes of Lu Ming and the others flickered. In that case, only those with the Phoenix body felt a strong pressure here. To others, there was no pressure at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
