The array Dao laws were also one of the king Dao laws, second only to the ten strongest laws.</p><p>At the martial sage realm, one could only cultivate and control one law. Only at the Martial Emperor realm could one cultivate many laws. This was an iron law. How could Lu Ming control two laws at the martial sage realm?</p><p>’’Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and slashed his sword. The terrifying sword radiance caused the void to tremble.</p><p>As the sword radiance slashed, the attack of the Supreme Saint from the purple Extreme sect was instantly shattered. The sword radiance did not stop. As it came down, the Supreme Saint of the purple Extreme sect was cut in half by Lu Ming’s sword before he could even scream.</p><p>So what if he was a Supreme Saint? Lu Ming, who had reached the Supreme Saint realm, could still kill him with one sword.</p><p>quickly retreat! This person is too monstrous! We can’t fight him head-on!</p><p>Someone roared as he frantically retreated.</p><p>A Paragon of the great sage mastery realm was killed by Lu Ming with one sword. This kind of combat strength was too shocking. It made them shiver all over.</p><p>The fourth prince of the Golden Crow clan, who had previously put on an air of superiority by relying on his cultivation, had retreated faster than anyone else.</p><p>However, when they retreated, it was as if they had hit a wall. The space in the void seemed to have become solid.</p><p>On the other side, Pao Pao pouted, looking completely harmless.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and slashed with his combat sword. The combat weapon aura soared into the sky.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as another Supreme Saint was killed.</p><p>The others were even more scared out of their wits. They fled frantically, flying in all directions.</p><p>However, bubbles cast the space-time domain and sealed the void. They could not escape at all. Lu Ming moved and killed another genius.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shouted again and the divine sword technique burst out, blasting into the bodies of those geniuses.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites below the Supreme Saint realm let out a shrill scream and then died.</p><p>All those below the Supreme Saint realm had their souls torn apart by Lu Ming and died.</p><p>Even Supreme Saints were shaking and bleeding from their seven apertures.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had skyrocketed after he had broken through to the Supreme Saint realm. These geniuses who were at the same level as him or one level higher were no match for him at all. The gap between them was too wide.</p><p>There were only four people left at the scene.</p><p>The fourth prince of the Golden Crow, the fifth Prince, the heavenly Bird Palace, and the heavenly Wolf tower each had a sovereign.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed so many of our men. You’re dead for sure!”</p><p>The fourth golden Crow Prince roared.</p><p>“What a joke. You’re the ones who came to kill Long Chen first.</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the fourth prince of the Golden Crow as he spoke coldly. Then, he charged toward the fourth prince.</p><p>The fourth golden Crow Prince’s expression was extremely ugly. At this moment, he seemed to have made a decision. His eyes flashed with ruthlessness. Then, he opened his mouth and spat out a pair of wings.</p><p>It was a pair of golden wings. With one look, one could tell that it was the wings of a golden Crow.</p><p>The Golden Crow fourth prince spat out a few mouthfuls of blood onto his wings. The wings shone brightly and the fire of the sun burned. It wrapped around the Golden Crow fourth prince and turned into a golden light, flying away like lightning.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The spatial wall that Paopao had set up was completely unable to block it and was pierced through. Then, with an unbelievable speed, the fourth golden Crow Prince disappeared into the distance.</p><p>“The wings of an Emperor-level golden Crow!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>He did not expect the fourth prince of the Golden Crow to have such a treasure. It was clearly a pair of Overlord-tier golden Crow wings. With the blood of the fourth prince of the Golden Crow, its speed was amazing. In a short time, it had a bit of the speed of the Overlord-tier golden Crow. Lu Ming could not catch up at all.</p><p>This was the best life-saving item.</p><p>With the fourth golden Crow Prince’s escape, the remaining three revealed a glimmer of hope.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better let me go. My fourth brother has escaped. The martial sovereigns outside will soon find out that you’ve killed so many of our people. They won’t let you off. Let me go and 1’11 find my fourth brother first. When we get out of here, keep this a secret and don’t tell anyone that you’re the one who killed them!”</p><p>The fifth Prince of the Golden Crow cried out.</p><p>that’s right. We can also keep it a secret. Otherwise, if the Emperor gets angry, you’ll die without a burial place!</p><p>The genius from the heavenly Bird Palace said.</p><p>“Oh, really?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked pensive.</p><p>The fifth golden Crow Prince and the others were overjoyed. They thought that Lu Ming was really afraid and did not dare to kill them.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming moved. He thrust his sword forward and pierced through the Golden Crow fifth Prince’s dantian, pinning him to the ground.</p><p>“Lu Ming…”</p><p>The fifth Prince of the Golden Crow screamed and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief. He could not understand why Lu Ming would suddenly attack.</p><p>what a fool. Even if today’s incident didn’t happen, do you think those Emperor-level experts would let me go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The four factions had been hunting him down ever since the incident at the thousand spirit exchange, and their relationship was irreconcilable. They would not rest until one of them was dead, so what difference would it make if today’s incident had not happened?</p><p>The two geniuses from the Sirius tower and the celestial Bird Palace were also stunned. They did not expect Lu Ming to suddenly attack them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen launched their attacks. The two men were careless and screamed in pain. They were killed by the two.</p><p>Their combat strength was not as good as Long Chen and Feng Ling, and now that they were distracted, how could they not die?</p><p>“You guys didn’t have to do anything, just leave it to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Huang Ling and Long Chen.</p><p>“They’re here to kill us, so how can we not kill them?”</p><p>Long Chen said fearlessly.</p><p>it’s a pity that one of them managed to escape. If the Emperor-level experts of the WAN family knew about this, they would probably go crazy!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>These were all the top geniuses of the major forces. This was a great loss that even the powerful forces of the Holy Lands would feel heartache.</p><p>so what if they’re mad? they killed us first. 1’11 definitely report this to the palace Master. It’s good enough that we don’t go to them for trouble!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Beside Huang Ling and the others, the other heaven’s favorites swallowed hard. Their hearts were in turmoil and they could not calm down.</p><p>A group of powerful geniuses had died just like that. Most of them had died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>He was truly a God of Slaughter. How many heaven’s favorites had he killed during this period of time?</p><p>“Let’s pack up and leave this place first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he put away the storage rings of these people and left the place one after another, heading towards the mountain of alchemy furnaces.</p><p>Lu Ming changed his form and aura again as he followed Long Chen and the rest.</p><p>In another direction, a ray of light flashed and the fourth Crown Prince of the Golden Crow appeared.</p><p>At this moment, his face was deathly pale. After he stopped, he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and quickly retracted his wings.</p><p>Although the pair of wings was an excellent treasure for escaping, every time he used it, he would suffer great losses.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve killed a few of the crown princes of my golden Crow clan. No one can save you. You’ll die without a burial ground!”</p><p>The fourth golden Crow Prince’s eyes flickered with a terrifying killing intent. He then took out a pill and swallowed it, beginning to recover from his injuries..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
