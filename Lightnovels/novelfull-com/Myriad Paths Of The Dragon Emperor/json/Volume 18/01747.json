The Golden Crow race was proud to begin with, let alone the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow race.</p><p>As for the tenth golden Crow Prince, he had suffered at Lu Ming’s hands time and time again in the hundred clan battlefield. Now that he had become a saint, he was also crushed by Lu Ming. He had a strong desire to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>However, although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he did not think that Lu Ming could fight against his ninth brother.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow had reached the peak of the bright Saint realm. His mastery of the divine ability was also very profound. His combat strength was many times stronger than his. He believed that he could easily suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s just a sick bird. I can suppress it with a flip of my hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>hehe, kid, you’re very arrogant. I’d like to see if you have the capital to be arrogant!</p><p>The eyes of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow flickered with a cold light. The fire of the great sun burned on his body like the son of the sun. His powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming, but Lu Ming was like a Buddha’s face in the spring breeze and did not feel anything.</p><p>The commotion here attracted the attention of the other people in the surroundings, and they all looked over.</p><p>after beating the small one, the big one comes. The Golden Crow race is getting more and more shameless!</p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out. The voice was crisp and clear, and it was clearly a woman’s voice.</p><p>The ninth and tenth golden Crow Prince’s faces darkened as they looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>Two women stepped on the air and arrived.</p><p>One of the women was wearing a Phoenix dress. She had a graceful figure and was extremely beautiful.</p><p>A Phoenix spirit!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He was about to look for Huang Ling and did not expect to meet her here.</p><p>The girl beside Huang Ling was wearing a long green dress. She had a round face and Jade-like skin. She was also very beautiful and was not much worse than Huang Ling.</p><p>The two women stepped on the air like fairies descending to the mortal world, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>who are these two beautiful women? especially the one in the Phoenix dress, she’s even more beautiful than the Jade Lake Saint!</p><p>of course, she’s the most beautiful woman in the Phoenix Palace, Huang Ling. Of course she’s beautiful!</p><p>the other woman isn’t much worse. She’s the heaven’s favorite of the pure snow Pavilion, mu Qingxue!</p><p>Discussions could be heard from all around.</p><p>Huang Ling and mu Qingxue came to Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>“What are you looking at? And you’re staring at me with your eyes wide open. Do you want to eat me? if you have the ability, come at me!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue’s big eyes glared at the ninth and tenth golden Crow Prince as she spoke in a tender voice.</p><p>The voice just now had come from mu Qingxue.</p><p>“Huang Ling, mu Qingxue, are you two trying to meddle in my business?”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Lu Ming is my friend. What do you mean by being a busybody? if you want to attack him, I naturally have to interfere!”</p><p>Huang Ling said with a smile.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow had a serious look in his eyes.</p><p>Although Huang Ling’s cultivation was weaker than his, only at the greater mastery of the bright Saint realm, her body constitution was extremely terrifying. If he were to really fight her, he had no confidence.</p><p>What’s more, mu Qingxue’s combat strength wasn’t weaker than his at all. If they fought, he would most likely be at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Kid, you’re lucky, but you can’t be so lucky every time. Tenth brother, let’s go!”</p><p>With that, the Golden Crow tenth Prince and the other two turned into two streaks of golden light and left.</p><p>“Good luck?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not comment.</p><p>After the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow left, Huang Ling looked at Lu Ming. She blinked a few times and smiled.”The power of a beauty is really great. Lu Ming, it seems like even heroes can’t overcome the charms of a beauty and the Jade lake’s Saint!”</p><p>Clearly, Huang Ling had seen Lu Ming’s drinking and chit-chatting with the Jade Lake Saint on the ninth Pavilion.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled awkwardly. don’t misunderstand. I’m here to accompany Xu Ran. I’m here to help her!</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Huang Ling pursed her lips and smiled.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>Mu Qingxue’s eyes widened as she sized Lu Ming up and down. Then, she said, ” hmm, you’re not bad looking. Your combat strength and cultivation are not bad either. No wonder Huang Ling misses you so much!</p><p>Qingxue, don’t spout nonsense. I didn’t …</p><p>Huang Ling’s smiling face immediately turned red as she glared at mu Qingxue.</p><p>“Oh? Didn’t he? I might have remembered it wrong!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue revealed a sly look and then laughed.</p><p>Huang Ling’s face turned even redder and she quickly changed the topic, ” “Lu Ming, why did you suddenly come to the ancient Moon Holy Land?”</p><p>of course, I’m here to see you because I miss our beauty, Huang Ling!</p><p>Mu Qingxue interjected from the side.</p><p>Mu Qingxue obviously liked to joke, which made Huang Ling’s face and neck blush.</p><p>“Huang Ling is so beautiful. Of course, I’d like to come here earlier to take a look. However, I’m here for another important matter!” Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Oh? What’s the matter?”</p><p>Huang Ling asked.</p><p>regarding evil spirit sect, Cang province has been occupied by them. Not only Cang province, but also cloud province and Emperor province. I came here this time to ask for help from the powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Evil spirit!”</p><p>Huang Ling and mu Qingxue’s expressions changed at the same time.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go to the Phoenix Palace first. We’ll talk as we walk!”</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and the four of them headed toward the Phoenix Palace.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming briefly explained what had happened in the Azure continent.</p><p>Phoenix spirit, I wonder if Phoenix Palace can send experts to annihilate evil spirit? ”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Huang Ling frowned and said, ” Lu Ming, according to what you’ve said, evil spirit cult and the Emperor family have cooperated to kill Emperor Yun in one fell swoop. They must be very powerful and have at least two Emperor-level experts. If Phoenix Palace wants to send people, they must send at least four or five Emperor-level experts. I don’t have the authority to send such experts!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He naturally understood this.</p><p>Emperor-level experts were high and mighty, they could rule a region. How could they be ordered around by a mere Saint?</p><p>in the Phoenix Palace, the only one who has this power is the palace Master!</p><p>Huang Ling said.</p><p>“How can I meet the palace Master of Phoenix Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>the palace master’s cultivation is profound, and she’s always in seclusion. Even other monarch-ranked experts find it difficult to meet her, let alone me. The number of times I’ve met her is less than three!</p><p>Huang Ling explained.</p><p>Emperor-level figures were rarely seen.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. He had long guessed that it would not be so easy to ask for help from the major forces in the Holy Land.</p><p>The main reason was that their strength was low. It was too difficult to meet with those Emperor-ranked experts unless they took the initiative to come and see you.</p><p>“I have a way for you to meet the Phoenix Palace’s master!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue said at this time.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>in another month, some of the Holy maidens and Holy Sons of the Phoenix Palace will enter a Phoenix’s nest to fight for a treasure. If you can help Feng Ling get that treasure, the Phoenix Palace Master might summon you!</p><p>Mu Qingxue said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
