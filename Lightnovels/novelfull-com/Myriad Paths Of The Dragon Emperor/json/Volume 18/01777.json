From now on, if I encounter any three-eyed God in the outside world, I will kill them without mercy!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. This was his promise.</p><p>Then, he stepped on the air and headed west.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the 80000-mile journey.</p><p>Up ahead, flags fluttered in the wind. This was a military camp with a large number of three-eyed gods.</p><p>Lu Ming stood quietly in the sky, hidden in the clouds. He looked on quietly, thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming turned and left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give up but he wanted to borrow strength.</p><p>There were great saints in the Great Perfection realm among them. With Lu Ming’s current combat strength, he was probably not a match for great saints in the Great Perfection realm. Moreover, there must be more great saints.</p><p>It would be unwise to charge in alone!</p><p>Although this place might be fake and an illusion, it could not be ruled out that it was real. This was because everything was too real. Lu Ming could not tell whether it was real or fake.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming arrived at the beast God mountain.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had come to the beast God mountain a few times with the tribe’s hunting team. He knew that there were a bunch of blood-eyed demonic apes living in the beast God mountain.</p><p>This kind of demonic ape was bloodthirsty by nature and very vengeful. Anyone who offended them would be chased to death.</p><p>Previously, when the tribe’s hunting team came here, they would avoid this pile of demonic apes.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming needed to borrow the power of these demonic apes.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed into the beast God mountain. Not long after, he came to a Valley.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At the entrance of the valley, there were two giant apes. Their eyes were blood red, and their bodies were as black as steel. They were more than five meters tall, and their auras were overbearing.</p><p>As soon as they saw Lu Ming, they roared and pounced at him with ferocious expressions.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. With a slash, one of the demonic apes was killed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The other one let out an angry roar.</p><p>The roars spread far and wide. Suddenly, the entire Valley was in a riot. A terrifying aura spread out. The terrifying roars spread out one after another as if they were going to overturn the mountain range.</p><p>The earth was shaking, and countless blood-eyed demonic apes rushed out of the valley like a flood of steel.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed and cast the chaotic finger of tribulation. He pointed with all his might and a huge chaotic finger of tribulation formed, pointing at the blood-eyed demonic apes.</p><p>The blood-eyed demonic apes exploded.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and ran, displaying his body movement technique to the extreme.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A few terrifying blood-eyed demonic apes emerged from the crowd with a deafening roar. Their auras were terrifying. They were definitely advanced great saints. They chased after Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>Lu Ming used the thundering wind steps and the air-frozen bead at the same time. A wave of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, and black wings spread out on his back. They worked together to increase his speed to the extreme as he charged towards the three-eyed God Army.</p><p>There were at least ten thousand blood-eyed demonic apes in hot pursuit.</p><p>Their speed was astonishing, and it didn’t take long for them to arrive at the three-eyed God race’s base.</p><p>The Army of the three-eyed God race had long since sensed the assault of so many blood-eyed demonic apes. The Army of the three-eyed God race flickered, and at least tens of thousands of three-eyed God soldiers appeared and formed a huge formation.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He charged straight towards the three-eyed God race’s camp.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill! a voice from the three-eyed God race roared.</p><p>Lu Ming did not care and continued to attack.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>A higher-up of the three eye God sect gave the order. Immediately, countless rays of light drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flickered non-stop as he dodged the attacks one after another. He was getting closer and closer to the three-eyed God.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned as dark as ink. He cast the soul illusion.</p><p>in the battle. He dodged with all his might, weaving through the Army of three-eyed gods.</p><p>22:40</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, other than the Supreme Saints, the rest of the three-eyed God Army were all affected by Lu Ming. In their eyes, Lu Ming’s figure seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>After a short pause, Lu Ming charged into the three-eyed God’s army.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were great saints of the three-eyed God race charging toward Lu Ming, but he didn’t linger in the battle. He dodged with all his might, weaving through the Army of three-eyed gods.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this time, the blood-eyed demonic apes finally arrived. They didn’t care about anything else and charged straight into the Army of the three-eyed God race. Anything that stood in their way was an enemy, and they were going to tear them apart.</p><p>A large number of three-eyed gods were instantly killed.</p><p>The Army of the three-eyed God race immediately retaliated by killing the blood-eyed demonic apes. This way, the blood-eyed demonic apes would target the three-eyed God race, and both sides would engage in a bitter battle.</p><p>&Nbsp; the two sides were like a flood of steel that clashed together. In an instant, a large number of three-eyed gods and blood-eyed demonic apes were torn apart and killed.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>In the sky, a three-eyed God with an unusually burly body and metal armor stood. His aura was incomparably powerful, and all three of his eyes were fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>He had seen clearly that Lu Ming had brought the blood-eyed demonic ape over.</p><p>Instantly, two Supreme Saints in the initial mastery charged at Lu Ming. Two beams of destructive light pierced through the void and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. He slashed twice at the destructive light. Then, his body trembled violently and he was sent flying backward, a trace of blood spilling from his mouth.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming had done this on purpose. Otherwise, how could two great sage lower tier three-eyed gods possibly injure him?</p><p>But in the current situation, acting weak was the wisest choice. If he acted too strong, he would attract even more experts from the three-eyed God race. He would first act weak and let the three-eyed God race fight the blood-eyed demonic ape while he reaped the benefits.</p><p>The two three-eyed gods charged at Lu Ming. Lu Ming deliberately fought with them, but he appeared to be at a complete disadvantage. He was being suppressed and was in a precarious situation.</p><p>As expected, when the three-eyed God in armor saw that Lu Ming was injured by two great saints at the initial mastery and was completely suppressed, a hint of disdain flashed in his eyes. He no longer looked at Lu Ming and focused his attention on the blood-eyed demonic ape.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! the three-eyed God roared as he charged forward. A destructive light shot out from his eyes, killing a Supreme Saint blood-eyed demonic ape. At the same time, he swung his battle-axe and killed another blood-eyed demonic ape.</p><p>“Kill these bastards!”</p><p>let’s go! the three-eyed God said as he led a group of his strongest experts toward the blood-eyed demonic ape.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>A brutal roar was heard as a 10-meter tall blood-eyed demonic ape dashed through the air towards the armored three-eyed God. It threw a punch that was imbued with demonic light, destroying the Light of Destruction.</p><p>Behind him, there were also some particularly powerful blood-eyed demonic apes. The two sides were fighting.</p><p>The strongest against the strongest, it was extremely tragic.</p><p>Whether it was the three-eyed God race or the blood-eyed demonic ape, they were constantly falling and dying in battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
