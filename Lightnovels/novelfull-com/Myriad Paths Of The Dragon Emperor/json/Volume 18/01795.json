The experts from the four major forces searched extensively, but Lu Ming seemed to have disappeared into thin air. No matter how the four major forces searched, they could not find him.</p><p>After a month, the four forces finally quieted down, as if they knew it was useless to continue searching.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was cultivating in the thousand spirit exchange. In his spare time, he would go shopping and buy some treasures. He was living a carefree life.</p><p>I still haven’t broken through to the great saint realm, but 1 should be close. I can feel that I’m about to reach the limit of a bright Saint. When the time is right, I’ll be able to break through naturally!</p><p>Lu Ming strolled along the street and bought some spiritual herbs and some dragon bones.</p><p>He had bought some absolute Saint Dragon bones and dragon blood in the thousand spirit exchange, but his spirit body didn’t evolve after refining them.</p><p>…..</p><p>It was too difficult for a medium grade heavenly spiritual body to evolve into a high grade heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>After all, a superior-grade heaven spiritual body was the highest level of spiritual bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming bought some items and returned to the inn to continue cultivating.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another month had passed.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the path-understanding ancient tree. At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar was heard from his body, and his Saint power gushed out like a pillar of air, soaring into the sky.</p><p>In his dantian, the two Saint hearts were spinning crazily, and endless Saint power gushed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on Lu Ming’s body suddenly soared.</p><p>Great sage, breakthrough!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and large piles of superior-grade raw stones appeared.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming released his devouring power and began to devour the energy of the rough stone and refine it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a black hole. Endless origin Qi gushed into his body and turned into his Saint energy. His Saint energy became stronger and stronger. His two Saint hearts became fuller and more crystal-like, and the pressure they emitted became stronger and stronger.</p><p>After a few hours, Lu Ming finally stopped devouring the essential Qi. The aura on his body then stabilized.</p><p>I’ve finally broken through to the great saint realm!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes and smiled.</p><p>After breaking through to the Supreme Saint realm, his strength had increased dramatically. If he were to fight against geniuses like Wan Pingyang and Xu tuo, he could kill them with a single slap. He didn’t even need to use the chaotic finger of tribulation.</p><p>now that I’ve broken through to the great saint realm, I’ll go out and take a look at the situation outside! su mo said.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>To break through to a new realm, it was impossible to just stay in seclusion. He still needed to gain more experience in order to reach the next level.</p><p>Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and headed outside.</p><p>However, the moment Lu Ming stepped out, he realized that something was amiss. Many people were flying out of the thousand spirit exchange.</p><p>The thousand spirit exchange had a large number of people going in and out every day, but it was still rare to see so many people flying out together.</p><p>“Uncle, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming pulled a yellow-faced uncle in his fifties and asked him with an honest smile.</p><p>“Little brother, you still don’t know, right? the ancient Great Yan elixir Hall has appeared!”</p><p>The yellow-faced uncle said.</p><p>“Great Yan elixir Palace?”</p><p>Lu Ming was confused.</p><p>“You don’t know?”</p><p>The yellow-faced uncle said.</p><p>uncle, I’ve just arrived at ancient Moon Holy Land not long ago. I’ve never heard of any Great Yan elixir Palace. Why don’t I go with you and you can tell me about it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said naively.</p><p>that’s fine. Come with me. We’ll talk as we walk!</p><p>The yellow-faced uncle said.</p><p>The two of them rose into the air and followed the crowd in a certain direction. On the way, the yellow-faced uncle explained everything to them.</p><p>In the ancient times, Gu Yue Holy Land had a sect that was famous in the entire Yuan mountain.</p><p>This sect was the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>The great Yan elixir Hall was so famous not because of its strength, but because of its alchemy skills.</p><p>It was said that the great Yan elixir Palace was a single sect and had very few people, but its alchemy skills were the best of the best.</p><p>The Dayan elixir Hall’s Dayan elixir Scripture could be used together with the Dayan elixir furnace to refine all kinds of pills that could seize the Fortune of heaven and earth.</p><p>For example, it could directly condense the laws of heaven and earth and refine pills that could improve the laws. Another example was that it could refine pills that could evolve the spirit body.</p><p>This kind of alchemy technique could be said to be incredible.</p><p>However, in ancient times, the Grand Yan Hall had suddenly disappeared in a day.</p><p>Even the main gate of the great Yan eltxir Palace had disappeared.</p><p>Countless powerful forces and experts almost turned the entire ancient Moon Holy Land upside down, but they still couldn’t find the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>There were countless conjectures about why the great Yan elixir Palace had disappeared overnight.</p><p>Some said that there was an unparalleled expert who coveted the inheritance of the great Yan elixir Hall and destroyed it, snatching the great Yan elixir Scripture and the great Yan elixir furnace.</p><p>But many people didn’t believe this.</p><p>Although the great Yan elixir Palace only had one disciple, every generation was a top-notch genius in the world. As each generation matured, their strength would be extremely terrifying. It wouldn’t be easy to destroy the great Yan elixir Palace.</p><p>There was also another theory that the great Yan elixir Hall had too few people, and in the end, its inheritance was broken, so it automatically went into seclusion.</p><p>Anyway, there were different opinions, and no one had a unified answer.</p><p>However, the great evolution elixir Scripture, this kind of alchemy technique that seized the good fortune of heaven and earth, was lost.</p><p>Recently, there was an anomaly at the former site of the Dayan elixir Palace. It was suspected that the Dayan elixir Palace was about to appear. Countless people went there to try their luck.</p><p>According to the ancient records, in every great era, there would be many geniuses, Kings, and scholars competing for supremacy. Those ruins and various ancient inheritances would also appear one after another in search of successors.</p><p>Now that they were in a great era, it was normal for the Dayan elixir Hall to appear.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. The great evolution elixir Scripture could directly condense the laws of heaven and earth to refine elixirs. It could even refine elixirs that could evolve the spirit body. This kind of alchemy technique was really heaven-defying.</p><p>If it was obtained by a powerful force, how many geniuses would be born?</p><p>Lu Ming followed the yellow-faced uncle and flew all the way. Not long after, they saw that the void in front of them was filled with people.</p><p>They had arrived at the old location of the great Yan elixir Hall!</p><p>The two of them flew into the crowd and found that everyone was looking in front of them. They saw a small hill in front of them. The small hill looked like an ordinary alchemy furnace.</p><p>“This is the old site of the great Yan elixir Palace. It looks very ordinary and there’s nothing unusual about it. How did it attract so many people here?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>“It’s here again!”</p><p>At this moment, someone spoke.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The small hill seemed to be shaking, and then a green halo spread out. Along with the Halo, there was a fragrance. It was the fragrance of pills.</p><p>“What a strong medicinal pill fragrance!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but take a deep breath. The smell of medicine assailed his nose. He felt refreshed and comfortable.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that the hill was emitting a medicinal fragrance. As the light spread, it was actually slowly growing larger.</p><p>Yes, the hill was growing bigger. Lu Ming would not be mistaken.</p><p>the hill has become bigger again. Every time it emits a Halo, the hill will become bigger. Is the great Yan elixir Palace really going to appear?*</p><p>…..</p><p>it’s very possible, but it hasn’t completely emerged yet. We need to wait!</p><p>Some people were discussing in the surroundings. Lu Ming had obtained a lot of useful information..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
