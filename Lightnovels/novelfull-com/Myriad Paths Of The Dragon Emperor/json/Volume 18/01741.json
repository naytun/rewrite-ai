It was hundreds of thousands of feet tall, and there were strange symbols flowing on the stone tablet. It emitted a light curtain that divided the heaven and earth into two halves, separating them.</p><p>that’s the boundary stone. Ancient Moon Holy Land is a Holy Land for cultivation. The original Qi is rich, and the earth is beautiful. It’s said that in the distant past, the powerful forces of ancient Moon Holy Land joined forces and created 108 boundary stones. They were erected around ancient Moon Holy Land, isolating it from the outside world to prevent the original Qi from leaking and affecting ancient Moon Holy Land!</p><p>...</p><p>Xu Ran seemed to know the ancient Moon Holy Land very well. Seeing that Lu Ming had some doubts, he explained.</p><p>the boundary stone can only isolate the natural Qi of heaven and earth. It doesn’t stop living beings from entering and leaving. Let’s go in!</p><p>Xu Ran continued.</p><p>The two of them stepped into the air. When they passed through the light screen, there was no obstacle at all. The light screen rippled like water, and the two of them passed through it.</p><p>“What a dense origin Qi!”</p><p>As soon as he passed through the light screen, Lu Ming could feel that the origin Qi inside the light screen was several times denser than that outside. Moreover, it seemed to be clearer to comprehend the heaven and earth laws here.</p><p>it’s indeed a Holy Land for cultivation. The cultivation environment is much better than the outside world. It’s two completely different worlds separated by a light screen!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>ancient Moon Holy Land, its territory is very vast, bigger than many big states. However, those who can establish a sect in ancient Moon Holy Land and take root in ancient Moon Holy Land are all extremely powerful and terrifying forces. Without strength, it is impossible to obtain a place in such a Holy Land. For example, those Emperor-ranked forces outside the Holy Land do not have the qualifications to establish a sect in ancient Moon Holy Land. Because their strength is not enough, they will be expelled by the powerful forces of ancient Moon Holy Land!</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Even Emperor-level forces could not establish a sect in ancient Moon sanctuary. How strong was ancient Moon sanctuary?</p><p>Xu Ran had been to ancient Moon Holy Land before and was familiar with it. He led the way, and the two of them chatted as they walked.</p><p>Not long after, a vast building complex appeared in front of the two.</p><p>Although it was far away, Lu Ming could still see that there were people coming and going among the buildings. It was very lively.</p><p>this is one of the buildings in ancient Moon Holy Land. There are many powerful forces in ancient Moon Holy Land with many disciples. There are also many cultivators from outside of ancient Moon Holy Land. These people will gather here to buy treasures and so on. It is very lively!</p><p>Xu Ran said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This building complex was like a city, except that there were no city walls.</p><p>The two of them flew forward and landed on the ground. They found that the streets were crisscrossed and the shops formed a forest. The two of them strolled along the streets.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and he was secretly shocked.</p><p>He realized that the people walking on the streets were all experts.</p><p>Their auras were thick, their qi and blood were like fire, and they were filled with Saint might. Many of them were actually experts of the Saint realm.</p><p>Even if the others were not Saints, they were at least half-Saints, and the lowest was a high-level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Saints were considered experts in the Azure region, but here, they could be seen everywhere.</p><p>it’s indeed Gu Yue Holy Land, one of the nine Holy Lands of Yuan mountain. There are too many experts!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>There were many powerful sects in the ancient Moon Holy Land. Within these sects, there were probably as many saints as there were hairs on an ox.</p><p>After all, there were 13 top sects in the Azure continent and many small and medium-sized forces. Adding them all up, there were quite a few Saints.</p><p>However, even if the entire Azure continent was added together, it wouldn’t even be comparable to an Emperor-ranked power.</p><p>However, in Gu Yue Holy Land, any force was much stronger than Emperor-level forces. One could imagine how many saints there were.</p><p>In addition, there were many experts from Emperor-ranked powers who came to ancient Moon Holy Land, so it was not surprising that there were many experts here.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that even the waiter who was standing in front of the shop and shouting was a half-Saint, which made him speechless.</p><p>“So many Saint weapons!”</p><p>He strolled through a few shops and realized that the items on display were all holy weapons. There were even great holy weapons and absolute holy weapons.</p><p>There were also many other precious treasures that dazzled Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming went to a shop and asked if there were any absolute Saint true dragon bones or absolute Saint true dragon blood essence. He did not expect that there was one, but the price was ridiculously high.</p><p>Lu Ming had once used the reincarnation halberd to kill two absolute Saints in the Tianyu demonic sect and obtained their storage rings. He was considered rather rich. However, he realized that he could not afford an absolute saint’s true dragon Bone and blood essence.</p><p>It was simply too expensive.</p><p>True dragons were the top existences even among thousands of divine beasts. They were very rare, especially the absolute Saints, which was why they were so expensive.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He had thought that he was already quite rich, but when he came to ancient Moon sanctuary, he realized that he had become a pauper.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming bought some spiritual liquid to water the path-understanding ancient tree. Then, he and Xu Ran found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>He would first settle down here, and then find an opportunity to come into contact with the powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Huang Ling and ye Dongfang. They were in ancient Moon Holy Land, but it was very big. He had just arrived and did not know where their sects were. The distance was too far, and it was difficult to transmit his voice.</p><p>Lu Ming, the Jade Lake Saint will appear in seven days to look for guardians. By then, there will be a gathering of geniuses. Maybe we can meet ye Dongfang and the others!</p><p>This was Xu Ran’s suggestion.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. That was indeed the case. Even if he did not meet Huang Ling and the rest, things would be much easier if he met his acquaintances from the hundred clan battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram after he entered the room in the inn.</p><p>There was a flash of light and the bubble rushed into Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>brother Lu Ming, bubbles is so bored here. Chirpy!</p><p>Bubbles pouted.</p><p>“Be good, paoba. I’ll take you out for a walk in a few days!”</p><p>Lu Ming touched bubbles ‘small head.</p><p>“Alright, alright, chirpy!”</p><p>Bubbles jumped up happily and skipped to the side to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming went to the path-understanding ancient tree and sat down cross-legged. Then, a Saint weapon appeared in his hand. It was a great saint weapon.</p><p>He planned to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had been so focused on comprehending the chaos finger of tribulation that he had neglected to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>In the Azure continent, he had obtained the storage rings of a few absolute Saints. There were many great saint weapons in them, which he could seal into his body’s acupoints.</p><p>Lu Ming did not plan to seal ordinary bright Saint weapons into his body for the time being. After all, there was a limit to how much they could improve. If he wanted to seal them, he would seal great saint weapons.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed as he began to seal the great holy weapon.</p><p>A great saint weapon was powerful, but it also placed a heavy burden on one’s body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current spiritual body was a medium-grade heaven spiritual body, but its strength was equivalent to a high-grade earth spiritual body. His cultivation had also reached the sage realm. It would not be a problem for him to continue sealing great sage weapons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
