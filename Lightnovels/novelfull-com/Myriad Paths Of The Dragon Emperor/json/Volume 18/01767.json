Boom! Boom!</p><p>Zi Zi Zi!</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the sea of lightning, countless lightning bolts surged towards them and struck them.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was flowing with chaotic laws. His palm was like a knife as he slashed out continuously, scattering the lightning.</p><p>it’s very powerful. Ordinary lower or upper tier bright sages would find it difficult to withstand it!</p><p>After clashing with the lightning, Lu Ming had a rough idea of the power of the lightning.</p><p>On the other side, the undying fire spread out from Huang Ling’s body and condensed into a Phoenix. The Phoenix spread its wings and destroyed all the lightning.</p><p>Long Chen’s attack style was similar to Lu Ming’s. He punched out with both fists, destroying the bolts of lightning.</p><p>As for bubbles, it was the simplest. Her entire body was filled with space-time laws, and when the lightning struck her, she disappeared.</p><p>“Those are the Laws of Chaos? And the laws of time and space!”</p><p>When the other young men saw Lu Ming and bubbles, their expressions turned grave.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of four shuttled through the sea of lightning, resisting the lightning as they advanced.</p><p>The lightning ocean was huge, but with the abilities of Lu Ming and the other three, they could completely withstand it. After an unknown period of time, they had passed through the lightning ocean.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>As soon as they passed through the sea of lightning, they saw a huge platform floating in the void. From afar, they could see some figures on the platform.</p><p>Had they finally arrived?</p><p>Their eyes brightened, and they sped up their journey, quickly arriving at the platform.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at the platform, the boat under their feet disappeared automatically, and the four of them stepped onto the platform.</p><p>“So many people!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and realized that there were more than a thousand people on the platform. They were all young men and women. Each of them had an extraordinary temperament.</p><p>Some of them exuded powerful auras. Some were bright Saints, some were great saints, and some were even absolute Saints.</p><p>However, most of them had completely concealed their auras, giving off an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>Lu Ming’s group of four stepped onto the platform. Some people glanced at them, but most of them sat cross-legged on the platform, resting with their eyes closed.</p><p>“There’s a door there!”</p><p>Huang Ling said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest had also discovered it.</p><p>In the depths of this platform, there was a huge stone door. The stone door was 10000 feet tall, but now, the stone door was tightly closed.</p><p>Around the stone door, there was a vast void, surrounded by clouds.</p><p>These young geniuses were probably waiting for the stone door to open.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three found an empty space and walked over. Then, they sat down cross-legged and seized the opportunity to cultivate and comprehend.</p><p>In this place, geniuses were as common as clouds. He had to make good use of his time to cultivate. If he could increase his strength, it might be of great use at a critical moment.</p><p>The platform was silent.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people came to the platform, and more and more people appeared.</p><p>Not long after, it reached about two thousand people, but it was still increasing.</p><p>When the number reached about 3000, almost no one came.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the huge stone door trembled slightly. Then, it emitted a dazzling radiance. Following that, a figure condensed.</p><p>It was a white-robed old man with a kind expression.</p><p>everyone, next, I will open the door and you will face a real test. However, I have to remind you that the test will be very dangerous. If you want to give up, just shout ‘give up’ and I will send you back!</p><p>The old man’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>But everyone’s eyes were very determined.</p><p>These young men came from different regions, but without a doubt, they were all powerful heaven’s favorites. To be recognized by the mixed energy token meant that they had endless potential.</p><p>Hence, these Young heaven’s favorites were all proud and confident. How could they give up so easily?</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>After the white-robed old man finished speaking, he waved his hand and a ray of light landed on the stone door. The stone door trembled and slowly opened.</p><p>Through the stone door, one could see a world behind the stone door. A lush and green World.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the stone door opened, some people rushed over, as if they were afraid that someone else would get there first.</p><p>Then, more people rushed forward.</p><p>The stone gate was huge. Even if thousands of people rushed through it together, it would not feel crowded.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were mixed in with the crowd and they rushed through the door.</p><p>However, at this moment, an extremely huge palm suddenly appeared in the sky in front of them and slammed down on one of the heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The giant palm was as big as a mountain and covered the sky. The heaven’s favorite screamed and was smashed into a meat paste by the giant palm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, with a loud roar, an incomparably towering giant ape leaped down from the sky, shaking the earth. A heaven’s favorite couldn’t Dodge in time and was trampled to death.</p><p>The palm just now had come from this giant ape.</p><p>The giant ape let out a long howl and slapped its huge palms at the others.</p><p>“We can’t fight them head-on, retreat!”</p><p>Someone shouted and retreated.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Then, roars came from the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his hair stand on end. A strong sense of danger enveloped him.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed. With a sweep of his Saint energy, he retreated rapidly with bubbles, Phoenix spirit, and Long Chen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another giant ape appeared at the spot where Lu Ming and the rest were just a moment ago. It roared at the sky and emitted a demonic aura.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Giant apes kept falling from the sky. These giant apes were thousands of feet tall and were bigger than a mountain. There were more than a dozen of them, covering the entire area. They kept slapping their palms at the geniuses.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few more heaven’s favorites were killed.</p><p>“Get lost, you bunch of trash!”</p><p>Someone shouted coldly. He actually didn’t retreat, but charged forward instead, erupting with an astonishing attack that directly confronted the giant ape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge explosion was heard and the giant ape was actually forced back. The man turned into a ray of light and rushed through the range of the giant ape’s encirclement, disappearing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming saw that it was the genius of the Thunder clan. He clenched his fist and the terrifying power of Thunder condensed into a palm. With one palm, he forced a giant ape back and easily passed through.</p><p>“What a powerful Lightning Force!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The lightning law was just an extremely ordinary law. However, when it landed in the hands of that person from the Thunder clan, the might that it could unleash was extremely powerful.</p><p>“Exterminate!”</p><p>A gray-robed young man, whose body was filled with a terrible aura of death, struck out with his palm, which turned into a terrible saber. With a slash, he cut off the palm of a giant ape, and then easily passed through the area.</p><p>“The law of death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>During this period of time in ancient Moon Holy Land, he had understood a lot. He had also understood a lot of the myriad laws in the world.</p><p>The law of death was an extremely terrifying law. It was on par with the law of chaos, the Law of Time and space, and the law of reincarnation. It was one of the ten most powerful laws in the world.</p><p>The person who mastered the law of death was known as the Son of Heaven, and his name was the son of death.</p><p>However, at the next moment, Lu Ming’s attention was attracted to another side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
