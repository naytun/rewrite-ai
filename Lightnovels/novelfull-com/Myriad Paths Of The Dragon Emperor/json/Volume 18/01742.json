It was extremely bright, like a small sun.</p><p>...</p><p>Then, the great saint weapon flew into the acupoint. Instantly, more than a hundred spots of light lit up on Lu Ming’s body, and a Saint weapon could be vaguely seen floating in each spot.</p><p>The Qi of more than a hundred holy weapons and combat weapons linked together, forming a powerful pressure. Lu Ming felt his acupuncture points swell. If his body was not strong enough, it would have exploded.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s physical body was strong enough and he managed to withstand it.</p><p>Slowly, the great saint weapon was sealed in the acupoint, connecting with the other Saint weapons.</p><p>“Two great saint weapons, but it’s still not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He had already sealed one great saint weapon before this, and with this one, he had a total of two. However, Lu Ming felt that he had not reached his limit and could continue to seal.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a great holy weapon and started to seal it.</p><p>Cultivation knew no time, and seven days passed in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming had sealed a total of four great holy weapons before he felt that his physical body had reached its limit.</p><p>&Nbsp; he then focused on cultivating the primal Chaos tribulation finger.</p><p>The cultivation of divine power techniques could complement the laws. The improvement of the divine power Technique would also improve the comprehension of the laws. Naturally, Lu Ming would not slack off.</p><p>After spending a month in the space-breaking flying shuttle and a few days of cultivation, his mastery of the primal Chaos tribulation finger had increased. It had already reached 15%.</p><p>One shouldn’t underestimate this 5%. If a complete set of nomological laws was divided into 100 parts, it would be equivalent to an increase of five parts, and its power would also increase by a large margin.</p><p>For a sacred art, the power would also increase with every slight increase in the heat.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade pool meeting began.</p><p>The two of them headed in the direction of the Jade Lake.</p><p>Not only them, but many people in the buildings were also heading in that direction. Many of them were young heaven’s pride talents, which showed how attractive the Jade Lake Saint was.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a large lake.</p><p>The lake water was clear, like a mirror embedded in the ground.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, they realized that there were already many people there. They were walking on the lake.</p><p>“They’re all top-tier heaven’s favorites!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the crowd and noticed that each of the geniuses had a strong aura. Their qi and blood were like fire and their spirit bodies were extremely powerful.</p><p>Many of them were actually heavenly spiritual bodies, and their cultivation had basically reached the Saint realm.</p><p>there are so many heaven’s favorites. Is the charm of the Jade Lake Saint so strong that she can attract so many heaven’s favorites? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was very surprised.</p><p>There were cultivators and martial arts powerhouses who liked beautiful women, but most people still focused on martial arts and were obsessed with cultivation. After all, the higher the cultivation, the longer the lifespan. Reaching the Emperor level, one would have an almost endless lifespan, which was what many people pursued.</p><p>But now, the birth of the Jade Lake Saint had attracted so many heaven’s favorites, which was strange.</p><p>these are all heaven’s favorites from the Emperor-level forces outside of the ancient Moon Holy Land. These people are not here just for beauty. The Jade Lake Saint is so beautiful that countless heaven’s favorites are attracted by her beauty, but most of them are here for the Jade lake’s resources!</p><p>each of the Jade lake’s saintesses is devastatingly beautiful. Since ancient times, many powerful heaven’s favorites have become her guardians. Many of these heaven’s favorites have great achievements in the future. Some of them even became emperors. They left many cultivation experiences and ancient scriptures in the Jade Lake!</p><p>there are thousands of laws in the world, but the Jade pool is said to contain the cultivation experience and divine power techniques of fifty percent of the laws in the world. Many of these Supreme talents came for the cultivation experience and ancient scriptures.</p><p>Xu Ran explained and Lu Ming came to a realization.</p><p>“The cultivation experience of a magical power Technique that contains 50% of the world’s laws?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>If that was true, then it was too terrifying.</p><p>In that case, did the Jade pool have the Super power Technique or cultivation experience of the ten ultimate laws?</p><p>“There are so many people here today!”</p><p>let’s go! a cold voice sounded. A young man in a golden robe with a noble temperament stepped on the air and stood above everyone.</p><p>ancient Moon sanctuary’s WAN family’s heaven’s favorite, Wan Tianlong!</p><p>Someone exclaimed in a low voice as he recognized the young man.</p><p>“The WAN family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Back then, in the hundred clan battlefield, he had killed Wan Tiancheng, a prodigy of the WAN family. He had also obtained the WAN family’s unique secret skill, the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>Wan Tianlong’s eyes were cold and arrogant. With his hands behind his back, he looked at the other heaven’s favorites with disdain.</p><p>Hmph, isn’t he just from a Holy Land faction? what’s there to be proud of? ”</p><p>A red-haired young man near Lu Ming’s group mumbled unhappily. He looked at Wan Tianlong with eyes full of fighting spirit.</p><p>Many of the heaven’s pride experts that came here came from Emperor-ranked powers, and the majority of them were the strongest heaven’s pride experts of Emperor-ranked powers.</p><p>After all, even in the monarch level forces, the heavenly spiritual body was extremely rare. For example, there was no one with the heavenly spiritual body in the cloud Emperor mountain.</p><p>These geniuses were usually high and mighty, dominating a region. Naturally, they were proud. Now that Wan Tianlong was standing above them and looking down on them with cold arrogance, many people were naturally displeased.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a brilliant sword light shot over. The sword light faded and a young man in a gray robe appeared. He carried a combat sword on his back. His entire person was sharp, like a divine sword.</p><p>it’s a powerful force from ancient Moon Holy Land, the heaven’s favorite of the wilderness sword sect!</p><p>There were also people who recognized this person’s identity.</p><p>The powerful forces of the ancient Moon Holy Land began to send their heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Then, a bolt of lightning flashed and a young man in a long robe made of lightning appeared. Some people recognized him as the genius of the Thunder God sect.</p><p>ye Dongfang is from the Thunder God sect. It’s a pity that he didn’t come!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Gah! Gah!</p><p>At this time, two long cries were heard. Two golden rays of light shot over at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>The next moment, the golden light disappeared and two huge three-legged golden crows appeared in the sky.</p><p>“The chosen of the Golden Crow clan!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed and became very serious.</p><p>The Golden Crow clan, without a doubt, was a terrifying force. Even among the many powerful forces in ancient Moon Holy Land, they were at the top, extremely powerful and terrifying.</p><p>The Golden Crow race was filled with experts, and every generation would produce many heaven’s favorites.</p><p>The two three-legged golden crows scanned the surroundings and turned into two golden-robed young men.</p><p>“The tenth golden Crow Prince!”</p><p>There was a cold glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>One of them was the tenth golden Crow Prince. Judging by his aura, he had clearly broken through to the sage realm. He seemed to be more than an initial bright sage.</p><p>The other person’s aura was even more terrifying than the tenth golden Crow Prince’s. From the discussions of the people around him, that person was the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The tenth golden Crow Prince’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned his surroundings. Finally, his gaze landed on Lu Ming, and a cold killing intent flashed through his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless as he looked at the tenth golden Crow Prince.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
