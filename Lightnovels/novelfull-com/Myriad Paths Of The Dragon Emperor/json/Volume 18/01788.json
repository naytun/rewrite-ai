How can it be so fast? he was only a great circle of the bright Saint stage a few months ago!</p><p>Feng Ling and Long Chen’s cultivation has also improved a lot. I heard that a few months ago, the paragons who obtained the primordial chaos token entered the primordial chaos sect to take part in the assessment. Perhaps Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and Long Chen have all obtained the primordial chaos token!</p><p>Hunyuan sect’s assessment has great opportunities. Perhaps that’s true!</p><p>The crowd discussed, and soon, someone made a rough guess.</p><p>…..</p><p>After all, the Hunyuan sect’s assessment was no secret. Every few decades, a group of geniuses would enter and take part in the assessment. It was easy to associate this with the sect.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was still shocking. He was a sacred Saint, and his opponent was also a peerless genius.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>Lu Ming collided with the other party dozens of times and then retreated quickly.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared.</p><p>“You’re thinking too much, Feng!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Following that, dense runes suddenly appeared on the long spear in Wan Pingyang’s hand. They flowed along the long spear and rapidly spread throughout Wan Pingyang’s body. They formed a terrifying sealing force that was about to seal Wan Pingyang.</p><p>“Damn it, What is this?”</p><p>Wan Pingyang bellowed in rage and unleashed his full power in an attempt to break the seal. However, he had exchanged so many blows with Lu Ming earlier and had laid down a terrifying sealing power. With all of them erupting at once, how could he break it in one go?</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure was like lightning. He appeared in front of Wan Pingyang in an instant and threw a punch at Wan Pingyang. Wan Pingyang cried out in pain and her body flew far away. A series of crackling sounds came from her body as her bone armor was shattered.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming unleashed his devouring power and enveloped all of Wan Pingyang’s Saint weapons so that Wan Pingyang could not take them back. Then, he used his Saint energy to cut off the other party’s connection and put away all the Saint weapons.</p><p>“My holy weapon!”</p><p>Wan Pingyang roared and spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>One hundred and fifty bright Saint weapons, twelve great saint weapons, and one absolute Saint weapon all fell in Lu Ming’s hands. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>The WAN clan’s cultivation had a flaw, and that was the expenditure. The value of sealing so many Saint weapons was simply too high.</p><p>This was his many years of hard work. Now, it was all gone and Lu Ming had taken it.</p><p>“I said, this is my spoils of war!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared beside Wan Pingyang. He looked down at the other party and said coldly,” “So what if you have a high cultivation level?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Wan Pingyang was so angry that he almost vomited blood. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming. Lu Ming, the WAN family will never let you off. You’d better return all my Saint weapons. You can’t swallow the WAN family’s Saint weapons!</p><p>“Hahaha, what a joke. You’re a piece of trash. You’re a great saint, but you’re not a match for a bright Saint. Now you’re threatening me with the power behind you. If you didn’t come from a powerful force, you would be a complete waste. I can kill a large number of you with a single slap. Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He gave Wan Pingyang one last kick on the head, sending him flying off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait!”</p><p>On the other side, Wan Tianlong rushed over and helped Wan Pingyang up. They flew up into the sky and left the place. Wan tianbing did the same. He had no face to stay.</p><p>“Who else wants to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were like lightning as he scanned the entire scene, especially the Golden Crow race’s side.</p><p>The fifth golden Crow Prince and the sixth golden Crow Prince’s faces were unsightly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s combat strength was unfathomable. He did not seem to have used his full strength against Wan Pingyang. At least, he did not see Lu Ming use any chaos law abhijna. Although the fifth Prince of the Golden Crow was arrogant, he was not confident that he could fight Lu Ming. He might even humiliate himself.</p><p>It was not that there were no more powerful heaven’s favorites at the scene. However, they did not have any grudges with Lu Ming and did not want to offend him, a heaven’s favorite with endless potential.</p><p>Therefore, no one went up to fight for a while.</p><p>“Since no one wants to fight, let’s continue drinking tea!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took a step forward and returned to the pavilion. He picked up his teacup and said with a smile,”It doesn’t look like it’s too late, and the tea is still hot!”</p><p>With that, he downed the drink.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had fought two rounds in a row, he was very fast and did not waste much time.</p><p>young master Lu, if you like it, you can come to the Jade Lake more often in the future. There’s plenty of tea!</p><p>Luo Tianyi said with a smile.</p><p>“How can I not come when a beauty has invited me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The others could only sigh. They were certain that Luo Tianyi had taken a fancy to Lu Ming.</p><p>Below, an unnatural expression flashed across Huang Ling’s face.</p><p>“Sister Feng Ling is jealous!”</p><p>Paoba muttered.</p><p>“You … Little girl, you’re spouting nonsense!”</p><p>Huang Ling’s face was flushed red as she picked up Pao Pao’s chubby body and rubbed it hard.</p><p>Lu Ming enjoyed the Tea Party while the others drank it as if it was plain water. Not long after, some people found excuses to leave. Some people took the lead and more people left one after another.</p><p>Not long after, only Lu Ming and a few people were left at the scene.</p><p>“Tian Yi saintess, I’ll visit you another day. Farewell!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Young sect master, you should come to the Jade Lake more often!”</p><p>Luo Tianyi smiled and sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left the Jade pool with Long Chen, Feng Ling, and the rest.</p><p>Back in the Phoenix Palace, Lu Ming continued his closed-door cultivation.</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming took out a combat sword, intending to seal it.</p><p>This sword was the absolute Saint weapon that he had taken from Wan tianbing.</p><p>Lu Ming now had a total of three absolute Saint weapons: a battle axe, a battle sword, and a long spear. Two of them were taken from the ten thousand celestial soldier, and the last one was from Wan Pingyang.</p><p>Other than the long spear, Lu Ming was more comfortable with the combat sword. He planned to seal this combat sword first.</p><p>When the ten thousand celestial soldiers were at the great circle of the bright Saint stage, they would need the help of a Martial Emperor to seal them into holy weapons. However, Lu Ming’s spirit body was stronger. 1 le was confident that he would be able to seal them successfully without the help of a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the ten thousand soldiers scroll and began to seal the</p><p>1 loly weapon.</p><p>One of the acupuncture points on his arm lit up, and the absolute Saint weapon flew into it. Instantly, a terrifying tearing force erupted.</p><p>The absolute Saint weapon was too powerful. Lu Ming’s arm swelled up and almost exploded. Waves of tearing pain spread throughout his body.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and circulated the ten thousand soldiers art with all his might, enduring the pain.</p><p>Slowly, the battle weapon Qi of the absolute holy weapon calmed down, and Lu Ming’s arm returned to its original state.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>He had finally succeeded!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>It was too dangerous to seal a holy weapon. If one wasn’t careful, their meridians would explode and their bodies would explode.</p><p>However, once the seal was successful, the power of the ten thousand soldiers scroll would increase dramatically.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming’s ten thousand weapons scroll and holy weapon were as powerful as the chaotic finger of calamity..</p><p>…..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
