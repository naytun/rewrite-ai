Did you get the heart of the parasol tree?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Yes, I got it!”</p><p>Huang Ling nodded.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue jumped up in excitement.</p><p>Huang Kong, Huang Bing, and the others were envious, but they were only envious. At this point, they could no longer fight for it. This time, many big shots of the Phoenix Palace would be watching. The previous competition was nothing, but now that Feng Ling had obtained the heart of the Wutong tree, they would be punished if they fought again.</p><p>“Huang Ling, congratulations!”</p><p>Huang Bing smiled and congratulated Feng Ling.</p><p>This time, Feng Ling had obtained the heart of the parasol tree. Coupled with her terrifying talent, her status in the Phoenix Palace would definitely be higher in the future. She might even be able to compete with those stronger geniuses in the future. Since she had already lost, she naturally had to build a good relationship with Feng Ling.</p><p>“Thanks for letting me win!”</p><p>Huang Ling also smiled.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Hmph! Huang Kong snorted unhappily. He then stepped down and left without stopping. The expert he had hired also left with him.</p><p>Sister Feng Ling, I’ll take my leave first!</p><p>Huang Bing smiled and left with Huang Jian and the others. Huang Xuan and the others also left, leaving only the four of them.</p><p>Feng Ling, congratulations. Through our hard work, we have finally helped you obtain the heart of the parasol tree. This trip was not in vain!</p><p>Qin Feng said with a smile.</p><p>“Our efforts? Pfft, Qin Feng, you still have the face to say that? did you deliberately let the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow injure Huang Ling?”</p><p>Mu Qingxue said with a sullen face.</p><p>“Mu Qingxue, what do you mean by this? Did I go easy on him on purpose? If you don’t have evidence, don’t slander me!”</p><p>Qin Yang said.</p><p>“Hmph, whether or not I’ve done it, I know it clearly in my heart!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue snorted coldly, then pulled Huang Ling’s hand and said, ” Feng Ling, let’s go. We don’t have to bother with such a despicable person in the future. This kind of person is one-faced and two-faced. It’s too dangerous to be too close to him.</p><p>Huang Ling smiled and looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and walked side by side with Huang Ling and mu Qingxue, heading back the way they had come.</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling did not even look at Qin Feng.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Qin Feng gritted his teeth, and his eyes flashed with viciousness. He then left as well.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to the exit and stepped into the vortex, leaving the place.</p><p>“Feng Ling, congratulations on obtaining the heart of the parasol tree!”</p><p>The old man from earlier said with a smile as soon as Lu Ming and the rest came out.</p><p>“You’re too polite, elder!”</p><p>Huang Ling bowed slightly.</p><p>en, Feng Ling, the palace Master wants to see you. I’ll bring you there!</p><p>The leading old man said.</p><p>“Palace Master?”</p><p>“Elder, Lu Ming also has something to discuss with the palace Master. Can you bring him to see the palace Master?” Huang Ling’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Are you bringing him? I’ll first report this to the palace Master and see what he thinks!”</p><p>He said for the chief.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble you, elder!” Huang Ling bowed.</p><p>The first elder took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message. After a while, he smiled and said, ” “The palace Master has agreed to see him, come with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling followed after him, while mu Qingxue went back alone.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a Grand Hall.</p><p>In the main hall, a beautiful woman in Palace Clothing sat. She had a kind expression and a faint smile.</p><p>She did not emit any aura. However, when Lu Ming approached her, her heart could not help but beat wildly. The muscles in her body tensed up and even her soul trembled slightly.</p><p>“How terrifying!”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely shocked.</p><p>The other party’s strength was definitely earth-shattering and had reached an unimaginable realm. As he approached, he did not emit any aura at all, but Lu Ming could already feel a terrifying pressure.</p><p>Was this the Phoenix Palace’s Palace Master?</p><p>Without a doubt, this was an Emperor-ranked figure. And even among Emperor-ranked figures, he was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“We pay our respects to the palace Master!”</p><p>The elder bowed respectfully.</p><p>“I, Feng Ling, pay my respects to the palace Master!”</p><p>Huang Ling also bowed.</p><p>“Junior Lu Ming greets the palace Master!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord nodded and said to the elder, ” “You may leave!”</p><p>“Yes!” That elder retreated.</p><p>Then, the Phoenix Palace Master looked at Feng Ling and smiled even wider. Huang Ling, you’re not bad. You didn’t let me down!</p><p>thank you, Palace Master. However, it was all thanks to Lu Ming’s help that Feng Ling was able to obtain the heart of the parasol tree this time!</p><p>After saying that, Huang Ling took out a piece of wood core. There were phoenixes dancing on it. It was extremely mysterious. This was the heart of the Wutong tree.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord waved her hand and kept the heart of the Wutong tree. She said, ” “Huang Ling, if you have any questions about cultivation in the future, feel free to look for me!”</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said,”Little fellow, I heard that you were looking for me. What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Palace Master, it’s because of the evil spirit cult incident!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Evil spirit?”</p><p>The palace Master raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“It’s like this …”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming told them about how evil spirit had attacked the Azure region and killed Emperor Yun. In the end, he expressed that he wanted to ask Phoenix Palace to send experts to exterminate the evil spirit.</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord frowned and pondered for a moment before saying, ” “Little fellow, I’m afraid I can’t agree to your request.”</p><p>“Palace Master, why is that?” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” little fellow, I might as well tell you. Some time ago, we found traces of an evil spirit sect Deputy sect leader in ancient Moon sanctuary!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord said.</p><p>“Evil Spirit’s vice-leader!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Huang Ling were shocked.</p><p>It was said that the Deputy patriarch of evil spirit was an unrivaled figure. No one had expected that such a figure would not die and would come out.</p><p>so, during this period of time, I have to put my attention on evil spirit cult’s vice sect leader. There’s also another one. Now, in ancient Moon Holy Land, all the major forces are deeply rooted and the competition is getting more and more intense. And according to what you said, there are at least two or three Emperor level figures in evil spirit cult and the DI family.</p><p>if we want to annihilate the other party, the number of Emperor-level powerhouses we send must be at least twice the number of the other party. This is the only way to ensure that we can annihilate the other party. Once the Phoenix Palace sends out so many Emperor-level powerhouses, their own strength will be empty, giving other forces an opportunity to take advantage of it. Therefore, it’s very difficult for me to agree to this condition!</p><p>The Phoenix Palace’s Palace Lord said.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He knew that it would not be so easy to ask for help from Gu Yue Holy Land.</p><p>These forces would first consider their own interests. If their strength was damaged, they would most likely not agree.</p><p>As the palace Master of Phoenix Palace had said, if Phoenix Palace sent out so many Emperor-level experts, Phoenix Palace’s strength would be weakened, giving other forces an opportunity to take advantage of it.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were many powerful factions in ancient Moon Holy Land, and the competition between them was extremely intense. Each faction had their eyes on one another, and under such conditions, they could not make a single mistake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
