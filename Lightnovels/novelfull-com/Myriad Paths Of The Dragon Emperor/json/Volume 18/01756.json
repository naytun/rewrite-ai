I’ll cultivate naturally!</p><p>The old man from the WAN family said.</p><p>“Since you’re cultivating it, are the cultivation techniques and martial techniques of the WAN family created by the WAN family? Isn’t it just to seize the others!”</p><p>the ten thousand soldiers scroll that I’m cultivating is something that I’ve taken from someone from the WAN family who tried to kill me in the hundred clan battlefield. This is my trophy. If the WAN family can cultivate other people’s cultivation techniques and martial techniques, why can’t I? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s clear voice spread throughout the entire area, leaving the WAN family speechless.</p><p>If they could cultivate other people’s cultivation methods and martial arts techniques, why could Lu Ming not cultivate the WAN family’s ten thousand soldiers art?</p><p>and all of you, you’re here for the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow, right? that’s even more ridiculous. He was defeated in a battle of the same generation, but he still came to find me. In that case, you golden crows shouldn’t come out anymore. Otherwise, if you’re defeated by others, all the older ones will go and ask for him!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the people of the Golden Crow clan, causing the ninth Prince’s face to turn red.</p><p>I can defeat you, but you shouldn’t humiliate the Crown Prince of the Golden Crow clan!</p><p>The middle-aged golden Crow race man’s gaze turned even colder.</p><p>what a humiliation! What a joke! All I did was to strip him of his fur. In a great battle, weapons have no eyes. How could I control them so well? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’re quibbling. Today, you must come with me to the Golden Crow race!”</p><p>The middle-aged man from the Golden Crow race said in a domineering manner.</p><p>that’s right. No matter how glib your tongue is, it’s useless. Let me tell you, I don’t care about other cultivation methods or martial arts techniques, but you can’t cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll. You must abolish it.</p><p>The old man from the WAN clan spoke in an even more overbearing manner.</p><p>“Hehe, goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He could not be bothered to waste his breath and turned to leave.</p><p>The WAN family and the Golden Crow race were simply unreasonable, so why did he need to say anything?</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>die! the elder of the WAN family shouted. A terrifying aura burst out of his body. It was the aura of an Emperor-to-be and it was extremely powerful. It pressed toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming felt an irresistible pressure pressing on him, as if he was going to explode.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of the Phoenix Palace was displeased. With a wave of his hand, a powerful aura rushed out and blocked the aura of the WAN family’s elder. Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Emperor-to-be was too strong for him to resist.</p><p>this is the Phoenix Palace. You’ve gone too far!</p><p>The Emperor-to-be of Phoenix Palace said coldly.</p><p>In the air, a few more elders of the Phoenix Palace descended from the sky, staring at the WAN family and the Golden Crow clan with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>is the Phoenix Palace really going to offend the WAN family and the Golden Crow Tribe because of Lu Ming? ”</p><p>The old man from the WAN family said in a deep voice.</p><p>Lu Ming is a guest of the Phoenix Palace. Since he’s a guest of the Phoenix Palace, I can’t let you take him away!</p><p>The attitude of the Emperor-to-be of Phoenix Palace also became stronger.</p><p>The WAN family and the Golden Crow race had ugly expressions.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, hide in the Phoenix Palace for the rest of your life if you can!”</p><p>A young man from the WAN family spoke. This person was dressed in a purple and gold robe and was filled with a noble aura. His aura was even more extraordinary than Wan Tianlong’s.</p><p>“What a joke. What else can the WAN family rely on other than the elders? If they are of the same generation as me, I will suppress them all!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded strongly.</p><p>you’re too arrogant. Fine, I’ll challenge you now. If you lose, you’ll have to destroy your cultivation. Do you dare to fight me? ”</p><p>The young man from the WAN family spoke, his eyes filled with coldness.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t agree to it. This person’s name is Wan tianbing. He has a medium-grade heavenly spiritual body and his cultivation has already reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. He’s many times stronger than Wan Tianlong!</p><p>Huang Ling hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Wan tianbing was very famous among the younger generation of the ancient Moon Holy Land. There were not many middle grade heaven spiritual bodies in the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>a medium grade heavenly spiritual body? ” Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit. alright, I’ll accept the challenge. But I’m afraid that if I defeat you, a bunch of old men from the WAN family will come out and find trouble with me!</p><p>don’t worry. If you win, the WAN family won’t ask you about your cultivation of the ten thousand soldiers scroll!</p><p>The elder of the WAN family spoke, as if he had great confidence in Wan tianbing.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked at the Golden Crow Tribe and said, ” what about you guys? do you want to challenge me? I’ll accept all of you!</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A young man walked out from the side of the Golden crow’s ninth Prince with an arrogant look on his face.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this man is the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow. His strength and talent are not inferior to Wan tianbing’s!”</p><p>Huang Ling quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, you and that Wan tianbing will attack together. I’m too lazy to fight them one by one. We’ll deal with them together!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded by his words.</p><p>Lu Ming was going to fight the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing at the same time?</p><p>One had to know that the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow and Wan tianbing were famous prodigies among the younger generation of the ancient Moon Holy Land. They were existences with medium grade heaven spiritual bodies and were almost invincible in a battle of the same level.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually going to fight two people at the same time.</p><p>haha, arrogant, he’s really arrogant. I’ve seen arrogant people, but I’ve never seen such an arrogant person!</p><p>Wan tianbing laughed, full of mockery.</p><p>nonsense, do you dare to accept the challenge? just say it. If you don’t dare to fight, then get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Fine, since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish. Sixth Prince, what about you?”</p><p>Wan tianbing said coldly as he looked at the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>he’s the one who’s looking for death, so we naturally have to fulfill his wish. Anyway, so many people have seen it, so they won’t say that we’re bullying the few with numbers!</p><p>The sixth Prince’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Alright, but I’ll decide on the time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you decide the time. If you set it a hundred years or a thousand years later, how are we going to compete? ”</p><p>Wan tianbing sneered.</p><p>how about the battle at Phoenix Lake in a month? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“A month later? Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>Wan Tiancheng and the sixth Prince of the Golden Crow spoke one after another.</p><p>In a month’s time, could Lu Ming turn the tables? moreover, they had joined forces. Lu Ming did not have the slightest hope.</p><p>They had heard about Lu Ming’s performance in the Phoenix’s nest.</p><p>However, they were medium grade heavenly spiritual bodies and their cultivation had reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage. Their supernatural powers were powerful and they could easily crush the heaven’s favorites of the same level, such as Huang Jian.</p><p>Therefore, they did not take Lu Ming seriously at all. They were confident that they could suppress Lu Ming alone, let alone the two of them.</p><p>Since Lu Ming was hiding in the Phoenix Palace and refused to come out, he would use the challenge to kill him.</p><p>a month from now, the battle at Phoenix Lake will begin. Everyone, please!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sleeves, turned around, and left.</p><p>The WAN family and the Golden Crow clan had also left. However, they still sent people to monitor the Phoenix Palace, afraid that Lu Ming would sneak away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
