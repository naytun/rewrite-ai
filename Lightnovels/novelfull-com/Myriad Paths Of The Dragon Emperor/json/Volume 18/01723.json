His eyes were filled with disbelief, and he slowly turned around.</p><p>Not far away, two old men were looking at Yin Zheng with cold eyes.</p><p>...</p><p>Yin Zheng’s face instantly turned pale.</p><p>The two old men were the valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Yin Zheng, I’m really disappointed in you!”</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master sighed.</p><p>“What’s there to say to him? if I don’t kill him today, he’ll bring endless disasters!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s face no longer had a gentle smile. Instead, it was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out as the cloud Dragon Valley master stepped out. The terrifying sword power pressed towards Yin Zheng.</p><p>“Yin Zheng, what are you doing? You want to kill me? I’m the master of the silver Dragon Valley, and my status is on par with yours. You’re not qualified to kill me!”</p><p>Yin Zheng shouted.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice was cold as he slashed out with his sword. The vast sword power caused Yin Zheng’s expression to change. He gritted his teeth and instantly rushed towards Lu Ming, wanting to take him hostage.</p><p>However, the cloud Dragon Valley master would not let him have his way. He changed the direction of his sword and slashed between Yin Zheng and Lu Ming. The terrifying sword power sent Yin Zheng flying while Lu Ming was unscathed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming. Once again, he swung his sword.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered in all directions, and Yin Zheng was almost cut in half. A terrifying wound appeared on his body, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His face was filled with horror.</p><p>Valley master, save me! Save me! I, the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley, have been giving my all for Dragon God Valley. I have made so many contributions over the years. You can’t just watch me get killed!</p><p>Yin Zheng cried out and begged the master of Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>Yin Zheng, I’ve never seen you spare no effort in all these years. You’re too selfish and devoted to yourself. Everything you do is for your disciples, your descendants, and yourself. You even abuse your power to seize the opportunities of other Valley disciples. The other Valley Masters have mentioned it to me many times and I’ve given you many chances, but you’re unrepentant!</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master sighed.</p><p>“No, there’s no such thing. Slander, it’s pure slander!”</p><p>Yin Zheng shouted and quickly denied.</p><p>“Slander? Then why did you ask Silver Dragon Valley to hide in the back during the war with the three sects?”</p><p>Ice Dragon Valley master continued.</p><p>“That’s not worth it. Is it worth it for Lu Ming, an ant from a deserted island? is it worth it to fight to the death for him? Who does he think he is? my attitude has always been to hand him over and ease the relationship with the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>also, the reason why I asked Lu Ming to hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance and treasures was also because of this. I didn’t do it for myself. I wanted to give it to other sects to appease their anger. This way, I can protect Dragon God Valley. Valley master, everything I did was for the sake of Dragon God Valley. Heaven and earth can bear witness to this!</p><p>Yin Zheng quibbled, just short of a nose and a tear.</p><p>He directly pushed away everything that he had done just now and said that he had done it for the sake of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. This old man was indeed more cunning than a Fox.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” this … Ice Dragon Valley master muttered.</p><p>&Nbsp; the valley master of Silver Dragon saw the hesitation on ice Dragon’s face and was ecstatic. He thought that he was saved and was about to say more.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A long sword pierced through his dantian from behind, shattering his Saint heart.</p><p>Yin Zheng let out a shrill scream and turned around madly, looking at the cloud Dragon Valley master in disbelief.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had actually made a move and destroyed his Saint heart in one move.</p><p>Once his Saint heart was destroyed, he would be a cripple. Even if he didn’t die, it would be worse than death.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>&Nbsp; Yin Zheng’s eyes popped out, filled with unwillingness. He had already persuaded the Ice Dragon Valley master, but he hadn’t expected that the cloud Dragon Valley master would not play by the rules.</p><p>so much nonsense. If I say I’m going to kill you, I’m going to kill you!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said indifferently. With a wave of his hand, his sword aura burst forth, and Yin Zheng’s body was reduced to ashes.</p><p>“You believed his clumsy nonsense?”</p><p>&Nbsp; Cloud Dragon Valley master waved his hand, and the sword flew back into his hand. He then gave Ice Dragon Valley master an unhappy look.</p><p>“It’s not that I believe him, it’s just that we’ve been fellow disciples for so many years, so I can’t bear to see him like this!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” hehe! Ice Dragon Valley master bitterly smiled.</p><p>“Valley master, master, why have you come here?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and asked curiously.</p><p>Yin Zheng, this guy, he’s always acting sneaky, he definitely doesn’t have any good intentions. Senior brother and I just happened to be going out for some business, and when we saw Yin Zheng going out as well, we followed him along the way. I didn’t expect him to actually have ideas about you, he’s really looking for death. Originally, we didn’t have a reason to kill him, but now it’s time to behead him!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and asked,”master, you said you were going out. What’s the matter?”</p><p>aren’t the other sects forming an alliance in the Tian Yu demon sect? let’s go and join in the fun. We can’t just sit and wait for our deaths!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“The Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>“Master, Valley master, when I searched Mo Yang’s soul earlier, I discovered a huge secret!” Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming told him about the blood demon Shakyamuni and the intentionless saber sect.</p><p>“What? The Tian Yu demonic sect has actually sided with evil spirit, and they’ve even hidden a Dharma King and people from the intentionless saber sect!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” what? ” Ice Dragon Valley master was shocked.</p><p>haha, just in time. Just in time, we can break their alliance!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes lit up and he laughed.</p><p>Ming ‘er, you should return to Dragon God Valley First. We’ll set off for the Tian Yu demon sect now!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master continued.</p><p>“Master, I want all of you to come with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, it’s too dangerous for you to go. There are many experts in the Tian Yu demon sect now. If the war starts, even I can’t protect you!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his hand and refused.</p><p>“Master, I’ve obtained a treasure in the hundred clan battlefield that’s enough for me to protect myself. I also have a plan that, if successful, can split the other party’s Alliance!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. He then told her his plan.</p><p>“You can really protect yourself?”</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley master asked again. When he received an affirmative answer from Lu Ming, he nodded and said, ” “Alright, we’ll carry out your plan then.”</p><p>master, please wait a moment. I have to send Yingying and the others back to Dragon God Valley First!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“We’ll bring you back with us!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and then kept Mo Yang into the mountain and river diagram. Mo Yang would be indispensable in his future plans.</p><p>As for the corpses of the two saints, Lu Ming burned them to ashes.</p><p>Then, the valley Masters of Cloud Dragon Valley and ice Dragon Valley brought Lu Ming back to Dragon God Valley. After releasing Qiu Yingying and her sister, the two Valley Masters took Lu Ming in the direction of the sky demon sect.</p><p>“Master, Valley master, with just the three of us, I’m afraid we don’t have enough manpower!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the three of us are obviously not enough. There are still others. I’ll bring you to them later!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
