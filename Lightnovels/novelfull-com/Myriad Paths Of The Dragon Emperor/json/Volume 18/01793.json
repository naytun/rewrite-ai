How terrifying would it be if the four forces joined forces? None of the forces dared to say that they could stop him alone.</p><p>...</p><p>Would Phoenix Palace or the divine elephant sect risk going to war with the four major forces to protect Lu Ming?</p><p>The answer was probably no!</p><p>After all, Phoenix spirit and Long Chen were only juniors. They could not represent the higher-ups of Phoenix Palace and divine elephant sect, those Emperor-level experts.</p><p>Would they protect Lu Ming and risk going to war with the four major forces?</p><p>“This time, the two of you didn’t kill anyone, so the four forces have no reason to deal with you. You can go back first. I was the one who killed them, so they can only find me. But don’t worry, 1 have a way to avoid the four forces” pursuit!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>…..</p><p>He had the divine breath technique. Unless an Emperor-ranked expert stood in front of him and carefully looked at him, there was no way they could recognize him.</p><p>“But, this is still too dangerous…”</p><p>Huang Ling was still worried.</p><p>you guys should leave quickly. If you’re any later, the other party will catch up. 1’11 go first!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming’s figure flickered and he left at a high speed. He then asked bubbles to open a space-time Tunnel and left this place.</p><p>Huang Ling and Long Chen had no choice but to return to their respective sects.</p><p>Lu Ming and bubbles did not fly for long before they stopped.</p><p>bubble, you enter the mountain and river diagram first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, brother Lu Ming. You have to be careful, chirpy!</p><p>Bubbles called out before entering the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body and appearance began to change. In the end, he turned into a dark-skinned young man. Even his aura had changed. He had become a completely different person.</p><p>The divine breath technique was similar to the illusionary breath technique, but it was more powerful and mysterious.</p><p>After changing his appearance, Lu Ming changed his direction and flew towards the thousand spirit exchange.</p><p>That’s right. He wanted to return to the thousand spirit exchange. The most dangerous place was also the safest place. The four great factions would never expect Lu Ming to return to the thousand spirit exchange.</p><p>Moreover, there were many people in the thousand spirit exchange. If he blended in with the crowd, the other party would not be able to discover him.</p><p>At this time, angry voices came from the WAN family, the heavenly Bird Palace, the heavenly Wolf tower, and the purple Extreme sect.</p><p>“Seal off the ancient Moon Holy Land and find Lu Ming!”</p><p>Following that, countless terrifying existences from the four forces stepped out and flew in all directions of ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>There were even Emperor-ranked powerhouses.</p><p>At this moment, the ancient Moon Holy Land was shaken. The four great factions were furious, and the ancient Moon Holy Land was about to make waves.</p><p>News of what had happened at the ten thousand spirit exchange quickly spread throughout the entire ancient Moon Holy Land.</p><p>Countless people were shocked by Lu Ming’s courage.</p><p>In the thousand spirit exchange, which was established by the four forces, he killed more than a dozen geniuses and Supreme Saints of the four forces. It was absolutely audacious. It would be strange if the four forces were not furious.</p><p>Just as the powerhouses from the four major forces rushed out, Lu Ming had already returned to the thousand spirit exchange.</p><p>He swaggered down the streets. No one knew that he was the one who had caused the commotion in Gu Yue. No one had expected that Lu Ming would actually come back.</p><p>Lu Ming found an Inn to stay in. He then entered his room and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>On a mountain peak, Xue ningxin was sitting there.</p><p>“Senior Sister!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to Xue ningxin’s side.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother!”</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes brightened at the sight of Lu Ming. Then, she looked worried and said, Junior Brother, you’re too impulsive. It wasn’t easy for you to escape from the Azure continent, but now you’re in danger again…</p><p>it’s fine. They can’t find me. Senior Sister, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>There were whip marks on Xue ningxin’s body. It was obvious that she had suffered a little. Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold again.</p><p>“I’m fine, it’s just some external injuries!”</p><p>Xue ningxin shook her head.</p><p>“Senior Sister, I’ll help you get rid of these seals first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, dense runes spread out from his palm and covered a ring on Xue ningxin’s wrist.</p><p>This kind of ring was condensed with special materials and techniques. It could seal one’s cultivation and was very magical. However, Lu Ming’s array law could seal some of it. It would be much easier to reverse the seal on the ring and break it later.</p><p>Then, he broke the other rings on Xue ningxin’s body one by one.</p><p>As soon as the ring was broken, Xue ningxin’s cultivation level was restored. As soon as her cultivation level was restored, her injuries recovered quickly.</p><p>After a while, the injuries on Xue ningxin’s body disappeared.</p><p>“Senior Sister, what happened? How did you get caught by the four great powers?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a series of questions.</p><p>He had heard from Zi Feng that the Ice Dragon Valley master had brought Xiangxiang, Tian Chui, and Xue ningxin to escape. Now that Xue ningxin had been captured, what about Xiangxiang and the rest?</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but worry.</p><p>when the evil spirit cult attacked Dragon God Valley, Valley master Ice Dragon saw the opportunity and rushed out with me, Tian Chui, and Xiangxiang. However, we were still discovered by the evil spirit cult. They chased us all the way and we escaped into the cloud Sea Mountain range. Unfortunately, we were unlucky and encountered a powerful ferocious beast in the cloud Sea Mountain range. After that, I was separated from Valley master and the others.</p><p>1 rushed out of the cloud Sea Mountain range by myself. 1 originally thought that ancient Moon Holy Land would ask for help from a powerful force, but 1 didn’t expect that before I reached ancient Moon Holy Land, 1 would encounter the people from the ten thousand spirit exchange. When they saw me, they didn’t say anything and captured me. Later, they brought me here to be sold as a slave!</p><p>Xue ningxin explained.</p><p>“Four great forces!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>Xue ningxin must have suffered a lot during this period.</p><p>“I wonder how Xiangxiang, Valley master and the others are doing? I wonder where he is?”</p><p>Lu Ming was still a little worried.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and Xue ningxin chatted for a while more before he left the mountain and river diagram and told her to rest.</p><p>After Lu Ming came out of the mountain and river diagram, he went to a restaurant and ordered some food and wine. He also asked for some information.</p><p>As expected, the entire thousand spirit exchange was discussing Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, a figure whizzed past, bringing with it a terrifying strong wind.</p><p>the four great forces have really made a move!</p><p>that’s for sure. Lu Ming killed more than ten paragons from the four major forces and caused a ruckus at the exchange. He’s slapping the four major forces in the face. It’s no wonder they’re mad!</p><p>that’s right. To be bullied by a junior to this extent, if they don’t take down Lu Ming, how are they going to survive in the ancient Moon Holy Land in the future?”</p><p>Speaking of which, this Lu Ming is really bold. I’m afraid he’s in danger this time. With an Emperor-level powerhouse out, he has no way to escape. Even the Phoenix Palace can’t protect him!</p><p>Lu Ming heard many discussions in the restaurant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a terrifying fluctuation came from the sky. An extremely terrifying Qi spread down from the sky, as if an entire world was pressing down, causing everyone’s face to change.</p><p>“Emperor level expert!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
