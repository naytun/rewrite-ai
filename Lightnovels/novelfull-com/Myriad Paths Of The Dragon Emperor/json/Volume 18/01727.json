Once you search his soul, it will be destroyed. Unfortunately, you’ve underestimated me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His smile made the sect master of the sky demon sect’s expression turn uglier and uglier.</p><p>...</p><p>“You’re still too inexperienced to try to deceive me. Let go of yang ‘er!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect sneered and stepped forward.</p><p>“Stop! One more step and I’ll kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed Mo Yang’s neck and said coldly as he retreated.</p><p>since you don’t believe me, then I’ll make it public. The Tian Yu demon sect is a remnant of evil spirit cult. At the bottom of the demon mountain, there’s a discipline King of evil spirit cult. There are also people from the intentionless saber sect hiding in the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>Lu Ming retreated as he spoke, his voice reverberating throughout the entire venue.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Many people’s eyes widened in shock as they looked at the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>Tian Yu demonic sect was actually evil spirit religion’s remnant, was that for real?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect glowed with holy light as he looked at the sect master of the sky demon sect coldly. “Is Lu Ming’s words true?”</p><p>nonsense! How could you believe such a clumsy plan to sow discord! ”</p><p>The sky demon sect master said coldly, his face extremely gloomy.</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect’s expression kept changing. Perhaps, this was really Lu Ming’s plan to sow discord.</p><p>if I want to verify whether it’s true or not, I just have to search Mo Yang’s soul again on the spot and project the images in his memories. Wouldn’t that make things clear? ”</p><p>“Everyone, do you want to see it? That’s very exciting!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Then, he lifted Mo Yang up and pointed at the space between his eyebrows, as if he was going to search his soul again.</p><p>“What do you want to do? If you want to harm yang ‘er, you’re courting death!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect bellowed as he swiped his claw out. A gigantic demonic claw formed and swiped at Lu Ming.</p><p>The demonic claw emitted a terrifying engine. It wanted to kill Lu Ming and Mo Yang together and destroy the evidence.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>High in the sky, a dazzling sword light slashed down, splitting the demonic claw in half. The sword light converged, and a figure appeared beside Lu Ming. It was the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to silence me, afraid that your evil spirit religion will be exposed?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Yun ruoxu, you’re here. Everyone, let’s attack together and kill them. Then, we’ll destroy Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shouted.</p><p>I think we should first search Mo Yang’s soul and see what’s going on!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect said coldly.</p><p>Although he really wanted to kill Lu Ming and the cloud Dragon Valley master, he could only put Lu Ming aside for the time being when it came to the evil spirit cult.</p><p>If the Tian Yu demonic sect was really evil Spirit’s remnant, and what Lu Ming said was true, then the matter would be serious.</p><p>It was obvious that the Tian Yu demon sect was using them as a tool to incite internal strife in the Cang region. If they were not careful, the Tian Shen sect would be destroyed. Such a big matter had to be cleared up first.</p><p>that’s right. I’ll search their souls first. If Lu Ming’s words are false, it won’t be too late to kill them then!</p><p>The jiuxiao sword sect leader said.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect’s expression changed. Then, he said coldly, ” alright, let them search our souls. We’ll kill them after we’ve proven the sky demon sect’s innocence. Lu Ming, search their souls!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect retreated, and his expression returned to normal. He had a clear conscience.</p><p>“Alright, master, you can search his soul and project the image!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Cloud Dragon Valley master as he mentioned Mo Yang.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master nodded and reached out to touch mo Yang’s forehead.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>At this moment, the sect master of the sky demon sect suddenly roared and attacked. He struck his palm at the sect master of the tianshen sect beside him.</p><p>At the same time, countless people in the crowd made their moves. Terrifying attacks were launched at the people around them.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect was shocked. At the critical moment, he used all his strength to block the attack of the sect master of the sky demon sect. However, he was forced to retreat and spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>In his haste, it was difficult for him to completely block the other party’s attack.</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect was more alert, while those who were less alert were directly killed.</p><p>At the scene, a series of miserable screams rang out.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>An unwilling roar resounded throughout the heaven and earth within the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>This roar came from another absolute Saint of the heavenly God sect. This time, there were two absolute Saints from the heavenly God sect.</p><p>Beside him, the tower master of the blood demon tower launched an attack on him. The terrifying sword light directly shattered his Saint heart. The sword light burst forth, and the Supreme Saint expert of the tianshen sect died!</p><p>In addition, the Yu Du sect’s experts also attacked the evil moon sect and jiuxiao sword sect’s experts. The evil moon sect’s sect master was severely injured, but fortunately, he reacted in time and was not killed.</p><p>In that instant, many experts from the three sects were killed.</p><p>blood demon tower, desire poison sect, you are all traitors!</p><p>The heavenly God sect’s sect master roared.</p><p>Lu Ming is right. You are indeed evil Spirit’s remnants!</p><p>The Grandmaster of the jiuxiao sword sect roared.</p><p>They had suffered a great loss just now. Ever since Lu Ming said that the Tian Yu demonic sect was evil spirit religion’s remnant, they had more or less developed a sense of wariness against the Tian Yu demonic sect.</p><p>However, he had never expected that the desire poison sect and the blood demon tower were actually Birds of a Feather.</p><p>“They’ve finally made their move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>This was his plan. He would use the excuse of searching Mo Yang’s soul to extort the Tian Yu demonic sect.</p><p>The plan was very successful, and the sect master of the sky demon sect did not dare to take the risk.</p><p>However, he had not expected that the blood demon tower and the desire poison sect were actually Birds of a Feather.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill them all!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shouted. His voice was extremely cold as he launched a storm of attacks at the sect master of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>The forces of the three major sects, the tianshen sect, the jiuxiao sword sect, and the evil moon sect, had originally been very strong. They were not weaker than the Tianyu demon sect, the blood demon tower, and the Yu Du sect.</p><p>However, they had just been ambushed. One of the divine sect’s absolute Saints was killed, the evil moon sect’s sect master was severely injured, and the other absolute Saint of the jiuxiao sword sect was also severely injured. They were in great danger.</p><p>The only one who could maintain his peak combat strength was the sect leader of the jiuxiao sword sect.</p><p>As for the great saints and bright Saints, they had suffered even more losses. The situation was extremely unfavorable.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this time, a large number of figures rushed out from another demon mountain, killing their way over.</p><p>“The intentionless saber sect is indeed here!”</p><p>“There are also people from evil spirit!”</p><p>“There are four absolute Saints!”</p><p>Someone cried out in alarm, revealing a look of despair.</p><p>One could tell that there were two groups of people among the people who rushed out. One group was from the intentionless saber sect, led by two absolute Saints. The other group was dressed in black robes and should be experts from evil spirit. The two people leading them were also absolute Saints.</p><p>The people of the three sects, the heavenly God sect, the jiuxiao sword sect, and the evil moon sect, looked desperate.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, take care of yourself!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said to Lu Ming. Then, he wielded his sword and charged at the evil spirit cultivators.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and the Ice Dragon patriarch appeared. His huge dragon claws grabbed at the two absolute Saints of the intentionless saber sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
