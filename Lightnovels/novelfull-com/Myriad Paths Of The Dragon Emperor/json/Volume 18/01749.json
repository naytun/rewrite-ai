They sized each other up and revealed their battle intent. The atmosphere was very heavy.</p><p>Feng Ling, I’ll definitely be the one to obtain the heart of the parasol tree this time. You should give up!</p><p>...</p><p>A young man looked at Feng Ling and spoke coldly. He was filled with confidence.</p><p>He was dressed in a Phoenix robe, handsome and full of nobility.</p><p>“What a joke, the heart of the parasol tree will definitely be mine!”</p><p>A voice came from the side. It was a woman.</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression was calm and she did not speak.</p><p>the man’s name is Huang Kong, and the woman’s name is Huang Bing. They have the highest cultivation among this batch of Holy Sons and holy virgins. However, their talents are not as good as Huang Ling’s. That’s why they’re always against her, trying to suppress her!</p><p>Mu Qingxue sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. The Phoenix Spirit had the undying Heavenly Phoenix body. The spirit body could continue to evolve through Nirvana. Back in the hundred clan battlefield, it had already evolved to a medium-grade heavenly spirit body. It was not something that Ordinary Geniuses could compare to.</p><p>Lu Ming sized them up. The helpers that Huang Kong and Huang Bing had invited were all very powerful. Their auras were strong and hard to estimate.</p><p>For example, the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was next to Huang Bing, and Wan Tianlong was next to Huang Kong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard in the sky. Three old men came through the air.</p><p>“Greetings, elder!”</p><p>Feng Ling and the other Holy Sons and Holy daughters of the Phoenix Palace bowed.</p><p>“You’re free!”</p><p>The old man in the lead waved his hand.</p><p>everyone’s here. Now, follow us!</p><p>After the old man in the lead finished speaking, he soared into the sky. The others followed him, and not long after, they arrived at a Valley. In the valley, there was a pitch-black Vortex, and behind the vortex was the Phoenix’s nest.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>The leading old man said.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! Huang Kong was the first to speak. He rushed into the vortex with his three helpers and disappeared.</p><p>Then, Huang Bing and the others rushed into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>“Let’s go in too!”</p><p>Huang Ling said and rushed into the black Tortoise, followed by Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>As soon as they entered the vortex, they appeared on a mountain peak. Looking up, they saw that the world in front of them was filled with thick black fog, which blocked their vision.</p><p>The others all appeared not far away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, Huang Kong and the others flew forward and disappeared into the thick black fog.</p><p>according to the investigation of the Phoenix Palace’s experts, the ancient parasol tree is in the depths of the Phoenix Nest!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>After that, the four of them also flew forward.</p><p>After flying into the mist, he found that the mist was too thick and he couldn’t see clearly. At first, he could still see the other Holy Sons and holy virgins, but later, they had completely disappeared.</p><p>After flying for a long time, they finally flew out of the fog-covered area and their vision widened. However, they didn’t see the other Holy Sons and holy virgins or their helpers.</p><p>It was clear that while flying in the fog, everyone’s direction was slightly off and they had already separated.</p><p>“This place seems to have experienced a terrifying battle!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue asked in surprise.</p><p>Looking into the distance, he could see many mountain peaks, but most of them had collapsed. Some seemed to have been cut off by a sword, and some seemed to have been smashed by a palm.</p><p>In fact, they even saw huge palm and fist prints on the ground.</p><p>this Phoenix nest should be a small world, and a terrifying battle happened in the distant past. Almost all the phoenixes here were killed. We have to be careful. I’m afraid that the Phoenix Spirit will appear and attack us!</p><p>Said Huang Ling.</p><p>The four of them concealed their auras and flew forward.</p><p>Before he could fly far, the cry of a Phoenix suddenly resounded through the air. Following which, a Phoenix burst out from the ground.</p><p>This Phoenix didn’t seem to have a physical body, but a black shadow. Its eyes revealed an intense hatred as it pounced toward the four of them.</p><p>Mu Qingxue let out a delicate cry and slapped out a palm. A terrifying cold wave rushed out and hit the Phoenix Phantom, sending it flying.</p><p>However, the Phoenix Phantom shouted again and rushed toward mu Qingxue.</p><p>“Cold wave sword, slash!”</p><p>die! mu Qingxue shouted as she clenched her fist. A terrifying cold wave appeared and condensed into a long sword. With a slash, the Phoenix Spirit was cut in half. It turned into wisps of black smoke and disappeared into the ground.</p><p>“A divine ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>What mu Qingxue used was a super power Technique. Her cultivation was also very high, reaching the peak of bright Saint. Her super power Technique was profound and her combat power was strong. No wonder the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was so afraid and left directly.</p><p>After killing a Phoenix spirit, the four of them increased their speed and rushed forward.</p><p>However, not long after they rushed out, the cries of phoenixes rang out again. This time, several Phoenix spirits appeared and pounced toward the four of them.</p><p>“Those with weak cultivation, step back and don’t get in the way!”</p><p>Qin Feng glanced at Lu Ming coldly, then stepped forward and charged at the Phoenix spirits.</p><p>Qin Feng’s combat strength wasn’t any weaker than mu Qingxue’S. No wonder he was so arrogant.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. Since he was not needed, he could not be bothered to do anything. He stood beside Huang Ling.</p><p>Mu Qingxue and Qin Feng joined forces and quickly destroyed a few Phoenix souls. The four of them continued to move forward, but more and more Phoenix souls appeared.</p><p>Mu Qingxue and Qin Yang were also finding it more and more difficult to deal with the situation.</p><p>Hmph, what’s wrong with Huang Ling? she invited a piece of trash. Otherwise, we would have an easier time if there was another expert!</p><p>Looking at the increasing number of Phoenix spirits, Qin Feng’s face became more and more unsightly. He began to not hide his thoughts and began to speak sarcastically.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, a massive Phoenix spirit appeared. This Phoenix spirit was several times larger than the other Phoenix spirits, and its aura was extremely thick and terrifying.</p><p>It screeched and pounced on Qin Feng.</p><p>Qin Feng unleashed his full power and struck out a huge palm toward the Phoenix Spirit. However, the Phoenix Spirit’s sharp claws destroyed Qin Feng’s palm print and slashed toward him with its blade-like wings.</p><p>Qin Feng’s expression changed. He took out a Saint weapon to block the attack, but he was sent flying. His face was pale and he almost spat out blood.</p><p>this Phoenix spirit is too strong. We can’t fight it. Let’s leave this place first and take a detour!</p><p>Qin Feng suggested.</p><p>“Take a detour? In my opinion, there are such powerful Phoenix souls everywhere. If we can’t break through here, it will be the same in other places!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>shut up! What right do you have to speak? we’re fighting, what are you doing? ”</p><p>Qin Feng shouted coldly.</p><p>At this time, the powerful Phoenix spirit pounced toward Qin Feng again. Qin Feng’s expression changed and he turned around to run, shouting, ” “Listen to me, we’ll take a detour. Even if we join forces, we’re still not his match!”</p><p>Qin Feng’s speed was very fast. As soon as he ran, the huge Phoenix spirit pounced on the Phoenix Spirit and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Huang Ling, be careful!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue shouted. She wanted to rush over to help, but it was already too late.</p><p>Huang Ling’s expression turned serious. Her body was filled with the unperishable flame, forming a flaming phoenix.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
