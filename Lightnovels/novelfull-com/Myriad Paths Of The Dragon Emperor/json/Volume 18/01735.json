He was like a stream of light as he approached the crowd.</p><p>There was a River flowing around his body, making him look like a god.</p><p>...</p><p>the laws have formed a River. This person has already completely mastered a type of law!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master roared in anger, his expression extremely ugly.</p><p>The others were the same.</p><p>The river around the white-haired old man was completely formed from laws. It was a River of laws.</p><p>The Saint realm was the cultivation of laws. Ordinary people could only cultivate one law.</p><p>He continued to comprehend and cultivate until he finally mastered this law.</p><p>However, it was too difficult to completely grasp and comprehend a law. It was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>Even if he cultivated to the great circle of the absolute Saint realm, he still hadn’t completely comprehended a single law.</p><p>When one completely comprehended a law, one would have already transcended the sage realm and was half a step into the Martial Emperor realm. This realm could be called the Emperor-to-be realm.</p><p>This white-haired old man was an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>An Emperor-to-be was much stronger than a peak absolute Saint.</p><p>Everyone gritted their teeth and increased their speed to the maximum, flying forward with all their might.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Streams of light streaked across the sky, and in the blink of an eye, everyone had flown tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired elder was getting closer to them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The white-haired elder shouted. With a wave of his hand, the river of laws turned into a huge palm, as big as a mountain, and blasted towards everyone. The terrifying power seemed to be about to burst the space.</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master and the others roared and blocked Lu Ming and the others behind them. The ten absolute Saints joined forces and unleashed their strongest attack. The ten attacks combined and blasted toward the huge hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was an earth-shattering boom. Although the cloud Dragon Valley master and the other top ten experts managed to block the huge hand, their bodies trembled and they retreated one by one, spitting out blood.</p><p>He injured ten absolute Saints with one move. The power was earth-shattering.</p><p>I’ll give you one more chance. Evil spirit is in need of manpower. Surrender and I won’t kill you!</p><p>The white-haired elder said coldly.</p><p>What made them even more desperate was that many figures were coming from behind. The other absolute Saints were coming.</p><p>“Leave this person to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the reincarnation halberd in his hand and strode forward. He held the sword with both hands, exhaled, and slashed the reincarnation halberd at the white-haired elder.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming released all the remaining energy in the reincarnation halberd, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>The terrifying energy on the reincarnation halberd made the white-haired old man’s expression change.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The explosive elder roared. The river of laws transformed into a huge sword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The halberd and the giant sword met in the air, and a terrible energy burst out, sweeping in all directions and destroying the world.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long hair fluttered in the wind, making him look like an invincible God of War. The reincarnation halberd glowed with a dark light, slowly pressing down on his opponent.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, his opponent’s sword light exploded with a bang. The terrifying energy on the reincarnation halberd completely hit the white-haired elder. The white-haired elder screamed and his body flew hundreds of miles away. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his aura was extremely weak.</p><p>However, the white-haired old man did not die.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. The other party was too strong. He was an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Of course, if all the energy in the reincarnation halberd was released, it could kill an Emperor-to-be. Unfortunately, Lu Ming had used the last energy to kill an absolute Saint in the great circle. As a result, he did not have enough energy to kill the white-haired elder. He could only injure him.</p><p>The reincarnation Emperor had once said that if the energy in the reincarnation halberd was fully unleashed, it could kill any expert below the Emperor-level, even an Emperor-to-be.</p><p>Of course, that was referring to the complete explosion of energy.</p><p>“Elder!”</p><p>At this moment, the experts of the DI family, the sect master of the tianshen sect, and the others also arrived. They exclaimed in shock.</p><p>What kind of weapon was in Lu Ming’s hand? it was so terrifying that it could even injure an Emperor-to-be. Previously, he had killed an absolute Saint in the great circle with a single strike. This shocked them so much that they didn’t dare to move forward.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At that moment, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s holy power rolled up and enveloped Lu Ming. Everyone continued to fly forward.</p><p>“Don’t let them get away!”</p><p>The white-haired old man shouted angrily, then sat down on the ground and began to heal his injuries.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The DI family’s experts, the sect master of the tianshen sect, and the others continued to chase after Lu Ming and his group. Not long after, another tens of thousands of miles had passed. After all, the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others had brought one person with them. The distance between the two sides was slowly closing.</p><p>However, they did not dare to make a move. Clearly, they were afraid of Lu Ming’s reincarnation halberd.</p><p>“You guys, attack first!”</p><p>An absolute Saint in the Great Perfection of the DI family looked at the sect master of the sky god sect and the others.</p><p>“Why should we make the first move?”</p><p>The expression of the heavenly God sect’s sect master changed drastically.</p><p>“If you don’t attack, you’ll die now!”</p><p>An expert from the DI clan coldly spoke.</p><p>&Nbsp; the sect master’s face turned ugly, but they were being controlled by evil spirit and could only follow orders. Otherwise, the other party could kill them with a thought.</p><p>Yun ruoxu, Lu Ming, you’d better surrender. Evil spirit has its eyes on you. You can’t escape!</p><p>The sect master of the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>“Even if we can’t escape, we still have to escape!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Stubborn! Kill!”</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect looked gloomy. He took out a Saint weapon and attacked the crowd from a distance.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master slashed out with his sword and sent the Holy weapon flying.</p><p>Following that, the other absolute Saints, who were with the sect master of the heavenly God sect, also took out their Saint weapons to attack Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>They were afraid of Lu Ming’s halberd and did not dare to get close.</p><p>“We’re getting close, attack with all your might!”</p><p>The Emperor family’s expert coldly shouted.</p><p>The sect master of the tianshen sect had a cold expression on his face. He suddenly sped up and condensed a spear of divine punishment in his hand, stabbing it toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley slashed out with his sword, sending the sect master of the deity sect flying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An expert of the Emperor family flew up into the sky and slashed down with his sword. An astonishing sword light slashed down towards the crowd, and they joined forces to block the sword light.</p><p>“That brat’s halberd should have some restrictions. He can’t use it now!”</p><p>Suddenly, the sect master of the heavenly God sect shouted.</p><p>He recalled the time when he was in the sky demon sect. At the beginning, Lu Ming was also courageous and invincible. He had killed a few absolute Saints in a row. However, in the end, he had watched the sect master and the others leave and did not pursue them.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s halberd could be used indefinitely, why didn’t he kill the sect master of the sky demon sect and the others back then?</p><p>With the power that could severely injure an Emperor-to-be just now, it was completely possible.</p><p>Moreover, he was being attacked by them, yet he had not used it. It was clear that there were some restrictions that prevented him from using it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. It seemed that he had been exposed.</p><p>The DI family’s warrior’s eyes glowed as he shouted,”Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Instantly, two absolute Saints in the perfected stage and more than ten absolute Saints attacked at the same time. The terrifying attack swept toward Lu Ming and the others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
