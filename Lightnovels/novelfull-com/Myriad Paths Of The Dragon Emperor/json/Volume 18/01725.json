Old man, if you want to attack, then attack. Last time, you managed to escape with your life. This time, I will take your life!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Arrogant, kill!”</p><p>cut! mo kong shouted. Holy light burst forth, forming terrifying ribbons of holy light that enveloped Lu Ming. They formed a terrifying cutting power that cut at Lu Ming wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming stood there quietly and did not Dodge, allowing the Holy Light ribbon to envelop him.</p><p>After the Holy Light ribbon had enveloped him, he made his move.</p><p>He struck out with his palm and the Holy Light ribbon exploded. Lu Ming moved like lightning and charged at mo kong.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Mo Kong’s expression changed drastically. He felt that Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased again. How was this possible? How long has it been?</p><p>“Devil flame war blade!”</p><p>“Poison rules the world!”</p><p>At this moment, the experts of the sky demon sect and Yu Du sect both made their moves. As expected, both of them had mastered Sacred Arts. The moment they attacked, it was a terrifying sacred art.</p><p>The power of the divine ability was extremely shocking. It could easily kill experts of the same level who did not know any divine abilities. However, Lu Ming’s expression was cold. He did not stop and struck out two palms in a row.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Their divine abilities were destroyed by Lu Ming. In an instant, Lu Ming appeared in front of mo kong.</p><p>Mo Kong’s body turned cold as he retreated frantically. However, a powerful devouring force enveloped him and made him stop.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and struck out with his palm. His palm was like a heavenly blade. Mo Kong’s body was cut in half and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Mo kong was dead!</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Mo kong was an old monster who had cultivated for more than a hundred thousand years. His cultivation had reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage and he had cultivated a divine power Technique. His combat strength was definitely at the peak of the bright Saint stage. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he was crushed and easily killed.</p><p>The visual impact was too strong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming killed mo kong, he did not stop and rushed toward the other two.</p><p>nine sealing gates suddenly appeared in the sky and suppressed the expert from the Tian Yu demon sect. The expert roared and madly slashed at the surrounding sealing gates. However, before the nine sealing gates could be opened, Lu Ming had already arrived.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>He screamed in horror, but Lu Ming’s palm came down and destroyed everything. The experts of the Tian Yu demon sect followed in mo Kong’s footsteps and were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had killed two experts. The last expert from the Yu Du sect was so frightened that he was scared out of his wits. He did not dare to fight Lu Ming and retreated frantically into the crowd.</p><p>“You’re really a piece of trash. Weren’t you very arrogant just now? Now, you’re so scared that you’re shrinking back!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the person from the desire poison sect in disdain.</p><p>The man’s face turned red and he didn’t say a word.</p><p>“This brat’s combat strength has become stronger again!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect murmured. His eyes were solemn, and his killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>The others were the same. They were extremely shocked.</p><p>A month ago, in the Dragon God Valley, although Lu Ming could suppress mo kong, it was definitely not that easy. He had to fight with many moves. But this time, he was completely crushed.</p><p>This was natural. Lu Ming’s spirit body had evolved into a medium-grade heaven spirit body and his combat strength had increased tremendously. It was easy for him to kill a character like mo kong.</p><p>“Who else wants to take me down? make your move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, a burly elder stepped out of the sky demon sect.</p><p>He had a strong body, and his demonic Qi was soaring into the sky. Every step he took shook the sky.</p><p>He stood in front of Lu Ming. His terrifying aura made it difficult for many people to breathe.</p><p>Great sage!</p><p>Many people murmured. The great sage was about to make his move.</p><p>great sage minor mastery, make your move. I want to see how strong a great sage is!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You’ll regret it very soon!”</p><p>The burly elder said coldly. He took a step forward and threw a punch at Lu Ming. The demonic Dao laws circulated. The punch caused the air to howl violently. It was like a mountain as it crashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A Supreme saint’s combat power was much stronger than a bright saint’s.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch as well.</p><p>There was no shadow of the stele, but Lu Ming’s fist seemed to have turned into the prison-suppressing stele. Even the color of his fist seemed to be the same color as the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Their fists collided with each other, creating a terrifying boom. A terrifying shock wave burst out from their fists and rushed to both sides.</p><p>The clouds in the sky were scattered by the shock wave as if they had been cut by a heavenly blade.</p><p>One of the demon mountains was hit by the shockwave and exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them retreated at the same time. They were evenly matched.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Many people gasped and looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>Abnormal, monstrous, too terrifying. He was only a lower tier bright Saint, but he could actually cross an entire realm and fight with a lower tier great saint.</p><p>What kind of concept was crossing over a major realm? they had never even heard of it before, let alone seen it. There was no record of it in the ancient records of the Azure continent.</p><p>The difference between the initial bright Saint realm and the great saint realm was too great. A great saint expert could kill a large group of initial bright Saints with one slap. But now, Lu Ming could fight head-on with a great saint expert and not be at a disadvantage. It was incredible.</p><p>The sect masters of the sky demon sect and the tianshen sect were filled with murderous intent. They had to kill Lu Ming. If this continued, it would not take long for Lu Ming to surpass and kill them all.</p><p>He had to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>is this all the great sage realm has? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Arrogant, kill!”</p><p>The tall and sturdy old man roared like a mad beast. A battle axe appeared in his hand. He raised the battle axe high and a huge axe formed in the sky.</p><p>Demonic light bloomed on the giant axe, surrounding the laws. A terrifying aura spread in all directions.</p><p>This was a terrifying sacred art.</p><p>After stepping into the great sage realm, it was not difficult to cultivate a super power. It was only a matter of how well it was done.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The burly old man waved his arm and the giant axe chopped down. It was as if it could split the sky and destroy everything.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s body glowed with light spots. There were a total of 108 light spots, and from each light spot, a holy weapon flew out.</p><p>A total of one hundred and eight holy weapons surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>A combat sword appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. Its sword Qi soared into the sky, and its aura was shocking. It was a great saint weapon.</p><p>He had obtained this great saint weapon from the divine Son during his battle with him.</p><p>In the past month, although Lu Ming had put all his effort into comprehending the chaos finger of tribulation, he had also taken some time to cultivate the ten thousand soldiers scroll.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had entered the Saint realm, his cultivation base had skyrocketed, and his spirit body had evolved. In one breath, Lu Ming sealed 108 Saint weapons in his acupoints, one of which was a great saint weapon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
