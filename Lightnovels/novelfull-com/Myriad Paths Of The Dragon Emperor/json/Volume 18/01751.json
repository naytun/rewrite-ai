He then turned into a golden light and rushed up the Jade stairs.</p><p>...</p><p>“The heart of the Wutong is mine!”</p><p>Beside Huang Kong, Wan Tianlong spoke and charged forward like lightning.</p><p>Soon after, mu Qingxue, Qin Chen, and the others also rushed up the Jade stairs, afraid that they would be one step slower.</p><p>Lu Ming did not move.</p><p>He felt that it was not that simple.</p><p>If this Jade staircase was really a test for the Phoenix clan’s juniors, it would probably be useless for the others to go up.</p><p>Lu Ming was not the only one who did not move. The disciples of the wilderness sword sect beside Huang Bing did not move either. They carried their combat swords on their backs and stood beside Huang Bing.</p><p>Huang Ling, Huang Bing, Huang Kong, and Huang Xuan were climbing up with all their might.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, mu Qingxue, the Golden Crow ninth Prince, and the others all came down from the top of the mountain.</p><p>we can’t go up the ancient parasol tree at all. There’s a powerful force blocking us!</p><p>Mu Qingxue said.</p><p>my guess is that only those with the body of the Phoenix can ascend the ancient parasol tree and obtain the heart of the parasol tree after going through the test!</p><p>Lu Ming speculated.</p><p>“It’s very possible!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue nodded.</p><p>The others had obviously thought of this as well. They stood behind Huang Kong, Huang Bing, and the others.</p><p>Now, it was up to Feng Ling and the rest. Whoever could reach the peak first would be able to obtain the heart of the parasol tree.</p><p>Huang Ling and the other three walked up step by step, but their speed was very slow. It seemed that the higher they went, the greater the pressure they felt.</p><p>“There are too many people here. In my opinion, it’s better to let some go down!”</p><p>The eyes of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow flickered with a golden light as he looked at Huang Ling, Lu Ming, and the others.</p><p>“I also think there are too many people. Why don’t we get rid of some?”</p><p>Another young man beside the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow spoke.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them walked toward Lu Ming and the rest. Only the heaven’s favorite from the wilderness sword sect did not move.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The Ninth Crown Prince of the Golden Crow transformed into his true form. His entire body was suffused with the terrifying divine fire of the Grand Sun. His wings were like blades as he slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The other person charged towards Feng Ling.</p><p>As long as he could knock Huang Ling down the Jade stairs or even injure her, he would be able to get rid of an opponent for Huang Bing.</p><p>Huang Ling was trying her best to resist the pressure on the Jade stairs and could not resist at all.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Mu Qingxue shouted as she fought with the heaven’s pride expert, blocking him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he struck out with his palm and hit the wings of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>With a clang, the sound of metal hitting metal was heard.</p><p>The wings of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow were tougher than ordinary holy weapons, but Lu Ming’s attack could even split a holy weapon.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack directly broke the divine Sun Fire covering the Golden crow’s wings. The terrifying power of the prison-suppressing heaven art surged toward the Golden crow’s wings. The Golden crow’s ninth Prince’s body trembled as if he had been electrocuted, and he quickly retracted his wings.</p><p>“Sick bird, I’ll strip you of all your feathers today!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He stepped forward and used the prison-suppressing heaven technique. His palm was like a knife, constantly bombarding the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a long cry and flapped his wings madly. Two suns condensed on his wings, completely formed by the divine fire of the great sun. They were extremely powerful and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming ignored him. He stepped forward and activated the chaos laws. He used the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck out with two palms.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two suns formed by the divine fire of the great sun exploded. Lu Ming rushed past them, his palms constantly striking the wings of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>The body of the ninth golden Crow Prince trembled violently. He could not withstand Lu Ming’s terrifying power at all. After a few moves, the Golden feathers on his wings fluttered as he was struck down by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Desolate sword, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow let out a long howl, his anger soaring to the heavens.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A visible sword light cut through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword radiance was pitch-black in color, but it was extremely sharp and terrifying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly stepped forward, his palm breaking through the defense of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. He grabbed one of the Golden crow’s feet, swung it up, and smashed it toward the sword light.</p><p>The sword light slashed down, and blood burst out. The sky was filled with golden feathers dancing.</p><p>One of the Golden crow’s ninth Prince’s wings was almost cut off. Although he was not cut off in the end, only half of his wing was left hanging on the ground. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow roared madly, like a little chick about to be slaughtered, flopping around in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“I didn’t cut you, so why are you shouting at me?”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and grabbed the injured wing of the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow with his other hand. He tore it with force. The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow gasped and let out a shrill scream.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>The sword hummed and the heaven’s favorite from the wilderness sword sect stepped forward. His eyes were like swords, piercing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“You can do it, but be careful not to cut this sick bird!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This heaven’s favorite of the wilderness sword sect had extremely shocking combat strength. His cultivation had actually reached the great circle of the bright Saint stage, which was much stronger than the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a sword cry, the combat sword on the back of the wilderness sword sect’s swordsman was unsheathed. It was an iron sword. The iron sword crossed the sky and slashed down at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming threw the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow at him. The swordsman of the wilderness sword sect narrowed his eyes and put away his iron sword. He slapped out with his other hand, forming a huge palm print to block the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow.</p><p>“Desolate sword, kill, kill that kid!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow roared.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Huang Jian’s words were simple. He returned to Huang Bing’s side after saying one word.</p><p>Lu Ming gave him a strong sense of pressure. He did not feel confident in facing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll remember this!”</p><p>The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and returned to Huang Bing’s side. He was bathed in the divine Sun Fire and began to recover from his injuries.</p><p>The heaven’s favorite who was fighting with mu Qingxue also retreated.</p><p>Wan Tianlong and the other paragons looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He could actually crush the ninth Prince of the Golden Crow. The ninth Prince of the Golden Crow was at the peak of the bright Saint realm and was a divine beast. He was born with the control of The Laws of the Sun and had condensed the sun super power. His combat strength was definitely not weaker than theirs. However, he was beaten up miserably by Lu Ming.</p><p>The four parties quieted down and waited for the battle between Huang Ling, Huang Bing, Huang Kong, and Huang Xuan.</p><p>The four of them glowed with brilliant light, forming images of phoenixes of different colors. They tried their best to resist the pressure of the Jade stairs and slowly climbed up.</p><p>Initially, the four of them were advancing at the same pace. However, not long after, Huang Xuan was at a disadvantage and was overtaken by the other three.</p><p>Huang Xuan was unwilling to give up and tried her best to catch up, but the distance between her and the three people in front of her was getting further and further.</p><p>In front of them, Huang Ling, Huang Kong, and Huang Bing were driving together.</p><p>Huang Kong and Huang Bing’s cultivation was profound. Both of them had reached the peak of the bright Saint realm, while Huang Ling had just broken through to the upper tier of the bright Saint realm. However, Huang Ling’s spiritual body was of a higher level, so the three of them were able to advance side by side.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
