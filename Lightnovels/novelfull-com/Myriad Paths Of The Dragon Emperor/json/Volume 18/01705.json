The sect master of the sky demon sect isn’t someone you can meet just because you want to. Leave!”</p><p>A young man berated, his tone getting worse and worse.</p><p>...</p><p>I’ve already asked to see you, but you’ve tried every possible way to stop me. I can only pay my respects to the devil’s doctrine’s sect master myself!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold. He had already lost his patience.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his powerful aura pushed the two young men away.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’ve got some nerve! How dare you make a move in the Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>“You’re dead!”</p><p>The two young men shouted, but they quickly retreated. They did not dare to stop Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air rang out in the distance. A few young men walked over, and the one in the lead was actually Mo Yang.</p><p>“What’s going on? Lu Ming, it’s you?”</p><p>shut up! Mo Yang berated. He swept his gaze around and his expression changed when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>senior brother Mo Yang, Lu Ming wants to see saintess Nian Qing. I told him that saintess Nian Qing is in seclusion and won’t see anyone, so he wants to break in!</p><p>A young man shouted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, How dare you! Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you have some strength. You’re still far from being arrogant in my Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>Mo Yang chided with a cold face.</p><p>“Oh, so you’re going to fight me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Mo Yang’s expression turned ugly as he retreated, his eyes flashing with fear.</p><p>Fight with Lu Ming?</p><p>What a joke. Lu Ming could probably kill him with one slap. How would he dare to?</p><p>if you don’t dare to make a move, then get lost. I want to pay my respects to the devil sect’s sect master!</p><p>Lu Ming berated and strode inside.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. A powerful force enveloped Lu Ming and stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>Then, a demonic light flashed and a beautiful middle-aged woman appeared before Lu Ming.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>When Mo Yang saw this, he hurriedly bowed and revealed a happy expression.</p><p>This beautiful middle-aged woman was the master of Xie nianqing, the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming greets the devil sect’s sect master!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed, neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p>master, this Lu Ming is arrogant and despotic. He doesn’t care about the Tian Yu demonic sect at all. He wants to break into the Tian Yu demonic sect. Master, please take him down and cripple his cultivation!</p><p>Mo Yang said, his eyes shining with a cold light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He was only here to meet someone and had no intention of humiliating the Tian Yu demon sect. He did not believe that the sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect, an Overlord of a region, would attack him.</p><p>If that happened, it would probably trigger a war between the Tianyu demonic sect and Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Alright, I already know about this!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect nodded and had Mo Yang step aside. He looked at Lu Ming and said, ” “You came here to see nianqing, right?”</p><p>“That’s right, sect master, please pass on the message!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I’m afraid you won’t be able to see nianqing for a while. She’s in closed-door cultivation, trying to break through to the Saint realm. She can’t be disturbed!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>“To break through to the sage realm?”</p><p>“Sect master, may I ask how long it will take for you to come out of seclusion?” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>a year at least, three to five years at most. It’s hard to say. If you’re doing this for nianqing’s good, please go back. When nianqing comes out, I’ll ask her to see you!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He did not know why he had a bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>He couldn’t help but think back to three years ago, when he came to the Tian Yu demon sect and returned, he was chased by the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>On the surface, the pursuit seemed to be due to jealousy between young people. However, Lu Ming had a feeling that it was not that simple.</p><p>However, the sect Master’s words were flawless, and he couldn’t find a reason to refute them. If he insisted on meeting Xie nianqing, he would be showing that he wasn’t thinking of Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Then this junior will take his leave. If nianqing comes out of seclusion, please let me know!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and turned to leave, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>master, why don’t you take this opportunity to cripple this kid? do you want me to bring some experts and kill this kid halfway? if this kid rises up, it will be a great disaster for my Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>Mo Yang said in a low voice.</p><p>“With Lu Ming’s current achievements and talents, do you think the powerhouses of Dragon God Valley would be at ease letting him go out?”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>“Master, are you saying that there are experts protecting Lu Ming in secret?” Mo Yang’s expression changed.</p><p>“No matter what? We can’t beat the grass and alert the snake at this time. Go back!”</p><p>With that, the sect master of the sky demon sect disappeared.</p><p>After leaving the Tianyu demonic sect, Lu Ming was frowning. He had a strange feeling about this matter, but he could not put his finger on it.</p><p>I hope I’m overthinking it. Let’s wait for nianqing to come out!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself as he headed towards Dragon God Valley.</p><p>After returning to Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming continued to cultivate in seclusion to build up his Foundation in preparation for his breakthrough to the sage realm.</p><p>Time passed by, day after day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a year had already passed since the treasure sealing assembly.</p><p>This year, the various powers of the Azure continent were all very calm. The Azure continent had entered a rare period of peace.</p><p>The powerhouses of the major forces seemed to have disappeared. Only a few young people below the seventh level martial Royal realm would wander outside and play out their own legends.</p><p>……</p><p>At the peak of a huge Snow Mountain in Dragon God Valley, a young girl in her teens, with bright eyes, white teeth, and Jade-like skin, could be seen moving around on the peak of the mountain. The soft whip in her hand whistled out, changing unpredictably.</p><p>One moment it was like a dragon, the next moment it was like a sword, the next moment it was like a spear …</p><p>The most shocking thing was that the young girl’s body emitted a wondrous aura that enveloped the peak of the snow Mountain. In the vast expanse of whiteness, there was no vegetation at all on the snow mountain peak, but small grass and trees actually emerged.</p><p>The plants were green and they were growing rapidly. Soon, the peak of the snow Mountain was covered with green grass and flowers. They stood out in the wind and snow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the shadow of the whip stopped, and the young girl’s movements stopped. She looked excitedly at the black-robed young man sitting beside her and said in a sweet voice, ” “Master, what do you think of Xiangxiang’s cultivation?”</p><p>not bad, your domain martial technique has already been cultivated to the third level!</p><p>The black-robed young man nodded with a smile on his face. However, there was still a trace of surprise in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>The black-robed young man was Lu Ming.</p><p>It was Lu Xiangxiang. More than a year ago, when Lu Ming had just returned from the hundred clan battlefield, she had just broken through to the spiritual God Realm. Now, however, Lu Xiangxiang had officially stepped into the martial Royal realm. More than ten days ago, she had broken through to the first level of the martial Royal realm. Lu Ming had taught Lu Xiangxiang a set of domain martial arts techniques. He did not expect her to cultivate to the third level in just ten days. Her comprehension was amazing.</p><p>In a little more than a year, he had advanced from the first level spiritual God Realm to the first level Martial Emperor realm. This speed could only be described as shocking. Of course, the further he advanced, the more difficult it would be to cultivate and the more time he would need.</p><p>Lu Ming, for example, was still in the third stage of the half-Saint realm. He had not broken through to the Saint realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
