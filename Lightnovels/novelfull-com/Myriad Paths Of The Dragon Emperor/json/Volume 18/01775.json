Die! one after another, the three-eyed gods descended from the sky and launched their terrifying attacks at the tribe.</p><p>...</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the experts of the tribe held large bows and shot out terrifying arrows to block the attacks.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>let’s go! a cold voice rang out. An extremely burly three-eyed God reached out with his hand and grabbed down. A huge hand formed and grabbed at the tribe.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The strongest fighting force in the tribe was the hunting team. They stomped on the ground and shot into the sky, slashing out all kinds of weapons at the giant hand.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Judging from the aura of the three-eyed God who had extended his hand, he had clearly reached the Supreme Saint realm. The strongest in this tribe was only equivalent to a great circle bright Saint. There was no way he could have blocked it.</p><p>As expected, when everyone hit the giant hand, they all trembled and spat out blood as they fell to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant hand continued to grab down and grabbed a few experts of the tribe. With a squeeze, those experts were crushed to death.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>&Nbsp; experts from the tribe shouted. The other party was too strong. With the strength of their tribe, they were no match for him. If they continued to fight, they would all be killed.</p><p>“No one can escape, surround them!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint three-eyed God shouted coldly.</p><p>&Nbsp; even more three-eyed gods appeared in the sky, surrounding the tribe.</p><p>More and more people stepped out and rushed into the tribe. Each of them had a powerful aura. Some of them were in the Saint realm, while many of them were in the advanced martial Royal realm or the half-Saint realm.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The three-eyed God wielded his battle-axe and swung it down, killing one tribe member after another. The stench of blood filled the air.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The third eye of the three-eyed God race shot out beams of destructive light that were unstoppable. One by one, the tribesmen were shot through and killed.</p><p>The simple and peaceful tribe was instantly reduced to hell.</p><p>“My cultivation, my combat power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anger. The Saint energy in his body was running wildly, but he could only exert the strength of a lower tier bright Saint. He condensed a long spear and threw it out, killing a few three-eyed gods in the third stage of the half-Saint realm.</p><p>However, there were simply too many three-eyed gods.</p><p>The tribe was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>It was as if Xia Hu had truly transformed into a ferocious Tiger. He wielded his battle saber and slashed two of the three-eyed God race’s Saint realm existences.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The great saint three-eyed God stared at Xia Hu and punched out, sending Xia Hu flying. At the same time, a destructive beam of light shot out from his forehead, blasting off one of Xia Hu’s arms.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>Xia Hua shouted, extremely anxious.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xia Hu wielded his saber with one arm and charged at his opponent. However, destructive light kept bursting out from his opponent’s eyes.</p><p>The difference in combat strength between the two was too great. Xia Hu fought back with all his might and blocked the two destructive lights, but in the end, his saber shattered. His body was torn apart by the destructive light and he died on the spot.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also roaring in his heart. Xia Hu had brought him “Father!”</p><p>Xia Hua cried out in grief, extremely mournful.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also roaring in his heart. Xia Hu had brought him back from the divine beast mountain and helped him heal his injuries. He was an honest and simple person. In the past two months, Lu Ming had already regarded Xia Hu as a friend and family.</p><p>However, Xia Hu had died in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Mother, don’t!”</p><p>Xia Hua shouted again.</p><p>At this moment, Xia Hua’s mother held a sharp knife and pounced towards the three-eyed God. However, in the next moment, a destructive light swept over and Xia Hua’s mother was killed.</p><p>“Mother!”</p><p>Xia Hua shouted, her eyes bloodshot. She threw away her longbow, pulled out the long sword on her back, and rushed over.</p><p>“Xia Hua, don’t go over!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and chased after Xia Hua.</p><p>“Die, ant!”</p><p>&Nbsp; a three-eyed God of the bright Saint realm appeared in front of Xia Hua and swung his axe at her.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He moved like lightning and rushed in front of Xia Hua. He swept his long spear and it collided with the other party’s battle axe.</p><p>There was a loud boom. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>The other party was also repelled by Lu Ming.</p><p>I can’t use any techniques, not even nomological laws. I can’t use much combat power at all!</p><p>Lu Ming was burning with anxiety.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The three-eyed God charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming wielded his long spear and fought with the other party.</p><p>At this moment, Xia Hua rushed forward again.</p><p>“Xia Hua, don’t die in vain!”</p><p>Lu Ming blasted the other party with one shot and pulled Xia Hua back.</p><p>big brother Lu, you should leave quickly. My parents have passed away. What’s the point of me living on? ”</p><p>Xia Hua said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Live on and take revenge for them!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly, causing Xia Hua’s body to tremble.</p><p>“Revenge? in your dreams! Go to hell!”</p><p>A total of two three-eyed Celestials charged toward Lu Ming. Both of them were at the bright Saint realm, and one of them was even at the upper tier.</p><p>The destructive light kept shooting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear and tried his best to block it.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s current abilities were limited. After a few moves, he was forced to retreat and spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>At this time, the entire tribe was completely immersed in blood and fire.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that his acquaintances from the tribe were killed by the three-eyed God one after another. Some of them were even killed without even leaving a corpse behind.</p><p>Lu Ming saw that uncle li, who often brought him medicinal wine, was split into two by a three-eyed God with an axe.</p><p>Lu Ming saw the simple-looking middle-aged man, who often brought him meat, having his head twisted off by the three-eyed God.</p><p>These three-eyed gods were truly demons.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the blood in his body boiling, as if it was about to turn into flames and burn.</p><p>An icy cold killing intent burst out from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The two three-eyed gods charged toward Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in front of Xia Hua to protect her, refusing to retreat.</p><p>However, there were simply too many three-eyed gods, and more three-eyed gods were coming from behind.</p><p>big brother Lu, if you can walk, just go. Don’t worry about me!</p><p>no! Xia Hu cried out as a few tears fell from her eyes. She turned around and pounced on one of the three-eyed gods with her sword in hand.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to shout but he realized that his throat seemed to be stuck and he could not shout.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Snowflakes flew in all directions. A teenage girl withered like a fresh flower.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a beast-like roar. His eyes were bloodshot, and a terrifying killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>At this moment, the entire tribe was almost wiped out. There were not many people left.</p><p>“Kill, kill them all, don’t leave a single one!”</p><p>Someone roared, as if he was really slaughtering some ants.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have broken some kind of shackles. His aura surged wildly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
