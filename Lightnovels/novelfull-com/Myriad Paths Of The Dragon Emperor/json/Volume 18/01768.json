The laws flowing around his body were actually the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Other than him, there were other people who controlled the Laws of Chaos.</p><p>“Could it be the chaotic body that Earth One mentioned?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that this was the only possibility.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect to see the chaotic body after such a long time.</p><p>This man was extremely powerful, like a god shrouded in the Laws of Chaos. With a punch, a giant ape’s palm exploded, and the giant body was forced to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>This person was incomparably overbearing. With a loud shout, his voice shook the heavens. He actually didn’t leave, but continued to attack the giant ape.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>His fists continued to punch down, blasting the giant ape into pieces.</p><p>This made many people gasp in shock.</p><p>Each of these giant apes was extremely powerful and difficult to fight against. However, this person had just blown them apart.</p><p>you guys think you can compete with me for the Hunyuan sect’s inheritance? you overestimate your abilities!</p><p>The black-robed young man’s entire body emitted chaotic Qi as he disappeared.</p><p>“Is this the battle prowess of the chaotic body?”</p><p>spoke coldly like a proud God. Then, he took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>“Is this the battle prowess of the chaotic body?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn, but there was no time to think. The four of them moved quickly and dodged the giant ape’s attacks.</p><p>With their combat strength, they were no match for these giant apes. If they were hit, they would probably be killed with a single slap.</p><p>“I’m here to help you!”</p><p>Bubbles’s tender voice rang out as the space-time law enveloped Lu Ming, Feng Ling, and Long Chen.</p><p>The laws of space and time were extremely profound. The three of them immediately increased their speed and dodged the giant ape’s attacks. They moved forward and quickly rushed out of the region.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out of the territory, the giant apes stopped attacking and only blocked the way.</p><p>There were people constantly rushing past, but the number of people killed was even greater. In a short period of time, Lu Ming saw at least a few hundred people killed.</p><p>These were all peerless heaven’s favorites from their respective regions. They weren’t ordinary heaven’s favorites and had shocking potential. In the future, when they grow, they would have no problem reaching the Emperor level.</p><p>It could be said that they were all future Martial Emperor figures. However, they were being killed one after another.</p><p>“Retreat! Retreat!”</p><p>Some people were scared and retreated to the gate.</p><p>“Since you don’t dare to move forward, I’ll send you back!”</p><p>The white-robed old man waved his hand, and the retreating young men were sent out of the place.</p><p>This way, some people were unwilling to give up and charged forward with all their might. People continuously died here, but there were also people continuously charging past.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three rose into the air and flew forward.</p><p>However, they did not fly far before they stopped.</p><p>In front of them, there was a deep abyss blocking their way. All the young heaven’s favorites who reached here stopped.</p><p>In the sky above the abyss, there was also a white-haired old man standing in the air.</p><p>This white-robed old man was exactly the same as the previous one.</p><p>It was obvious that this was not a real entity, but a projection that could appear in different places at the same time.</p><p>this abyss can not be crossed. Only when everyone is here can we cross it with a special method!</p><p>The white-robed old man said.</p><p>No one would doubt the words of the white-robed old man. He was simply unfathomable and unpredictable.</p><p>Moreover, since ancient times, countless people had entered this place. Many successors of major forces understood this point. Only by following the rules here and passing through each level could one reach the end and obtain great benefits.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a tall figure appeared in front of Lu Ming, Huang Ling, and the others. A terrifying aura pressed down on them.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest’s expressions changed.</p><p>This was because this young man was the genius who had used the Laws of Chaos and seemed to possess the chaotic body.</p><p>The terrifying aura forced Lu Ming and the others to release their auras to resist it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was also flowing with chaos laws, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>the law of chaos! Two people have mastered the law of chaos!</p><p>Many people exclaimed in shock.</p><p>the great era is coming. Many peerless geniuses will have a fated enemy!</p><p>Someone said solemnly.</p><p>Those who had mastered the ten ultimate laws were not invincible. They would encounter other powerhouses who had mastered the ultimate laws, or even those who had mastered the same laws.</p><p>Not only one person could master the ten strongest maxims. In a great era, there might be two or even three people who could master them.</p><p>Such people were known as fated enemies.</p><p>Two tigers couldn’t share the same mountain. Such a great enemy was destined to have a winner. Only by stepping on the opponent’s bones could one reach the strongest.</p><p>Of course, all of this was just a legend, because there were too few people who could master the ten ultimate maxims. In ordinary times, in tens of thousands of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years, it was difficult to find one, not to mention several people who could master the same Maxim at the same time.</p><p>However, with the arrival of the great era, the era where all the geniuses rose up, things were different.</p><p>The black-robed young man looked at Lu Ming coldly and said, the person who entered the primal Chaos Palace before me was you, right? ”</p><p>As expected, this person really had the chaotic body. He had seen Lu Ming use the chaotic law earlier.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Since he had been seen, there was no point in denying it. He might as well admit it.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Excitement and fanaticism flashed across the eyes of the chaotic body. He stared at Lu Ming and said, now, hand over the chaos Scripture and destroy your own cultivation. In this world, only I can control the chaos laws. No one else is worthy!</p><p>The voice of the chaotic body was filled with confidence and pride.</p><p>In this world, he was the only one who could control the Laws of Chaos. The others were not worthy. If they did, they should be killed or crippled.</p><p>“Ridiculous, Who Do You Think You Are?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The other party wanted him to cripple himself. How could he agree to that, despite the other party’s terrifying combat strength?</p><p>“If you don’t agree, then die!”</p><p>I’ll go with you, ” the chaotic body said coldly. His aura grew stronger as he took a step forward. The violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming, causing him to back away.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Pao Pao shouted and stepped forward, releasing her aura to help Lu Ming fight against the other party.</p><p>space-time laws? that’s good. I’ll kill them all!</p><p>The chaotic body sneered.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Huang Ling and Long Chen also stepped forward and stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“All of you, retreat! This matter has nothing to do with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. The other party was too strong. Even if they joined forces, they would not be a match for him. There was no hope at all. The other party was only targeting him. He did not want to implicate Long Chen, Feng Ling, and bubbles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you think I’m that kind of person?”</p><p>Huang Ling glanced at Lu Ming with a determined look.</p><p>Long Chen didn’t say anything, but his actions spoke for themselves.</p><p>hehe, you’re quite loyal. Then let’s kill them both!</p><p>The chaotic body said coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>At the side, the others looked on coldly.</p><p>It was good that Lu Ming and the rest were killed. They would have fewer enemies in the future.</p><p>Although these peerless geniuses were scattered all over the place, as their cultivation continued to improve, they would meet sooner or later to determine the winner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
