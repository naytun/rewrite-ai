His heart was bleeding. An absolute Saint had been killed just like that. What a great loss.</p><p>...</p><p>A top sect didn’t have many absolute Saints.</p><p>“I naturally know!”</p><p>The noble middle-aged man said indifferently.</p><p>“Since you already know, why are you still helping the evildoers?”</p><p>The sect master of the evil moon sect shouted.</p><p>“Helping the evildoer? What a joke, come out!”</p><p>The noble middle-aged man said indifferently.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, terrifying auras came from all directions. Golden sword lights shot up into the sky, stirring up the thick fog.</p><p>Then, one figure after another appeared before everyone’s eyes.</p><p>He was dressed in a golden robe and had a Jade crown on his head. He was filled with an air of nobility, and his temperament was very similar to that of the middle-aged man.</p><p>The people of the DI family were all from the DI family, and there were more than 10000 of them. Every one of them was emitting a terrifying Qi.</p><p>The number of bright Saints and Supreme Saints was shocking. There were even more than a dozen absolute Saints.</p><p>Three of them had the most terrifying auras. They were no weaker than the noble middle-aged man and were all in the absolute Saint realm.</p><p>In addition to the noble middle-aged man, there were a total of four absolute Saints in the great circle.</p><p>At this moment, the experts of the major sects all turned pale.</p><p>They were surrounded.</p><p>“Your di family has also joined evil spirit!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“What do you mean by surrender? it’s just cooperation!”</p><p>The noble middle-aged man said indifferently.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve said it before. You’re the ones who will die today. Evil spirit will rule the Azure continent!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect laughed.</p><p>The hearts of Lu Ming and the rest sank.</p><p>They understood that they had fallen into a trap. The other party was waiting for them to come.</p><p>However, how could they have expected such a thing? how could they have expected that the DI family would also side with evil spirit sect and send out such a shocking force to destroy them in one fell swoop?</p><p>“Your di family has sent so many experts to the Azure continent. Aren’t you afraid that the cloud Emperor mountain will take advantage of this?”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said, his brows tightly furrowed.</p><p>Today, they were in trouble. The other party’s strength was far above them. If they fought, they had no hope.</p><p>The other party had four great beings in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm. Four great beings in the great circle of the absolute Saint realm were enough to deal with all of the absolute Saints. Furthermore, they didn’t know if the other party had other great beings in the dark.</p><p>it seems that you are still unwilling to give up. I will make you give up. The cloud Emperor mountain was destroyed by my di family half a month ago. Emperor Yun was killed by the martial sovereign of my family!</p><p>The noble middle-aged man said.</p><p>“What? The cloud Emperor mountain has been destroyed!”</p><p>Emperor Yun was killed? how is that possible? that’s a great emperor!</p><p>Countless people exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>The grey state, the cloud state where the cloud Emperor mountain was located, and the Emperor state where the DI family was located. These three states were closely connected.</p><p>The cloud Prefecture was to the West of the Cang Prefecture, while the Emperor Prefecture was to the Northwest of the Cang Prefecture.</p><p>Other than that, there were no other Emperor-ranked powers.</p><p>That was because the Cang Prefecture, the Emperor Prefecture, and the cloud Prefecture were located in the middle of the cloud Mountain range. The terrain was flat and the original Qi was rich.</p><p>The cloud Mountain range was vast and boundless. It was surrounded by steep and evil peaks, where countless ferocious beasts resided. Only these three prefectures were opened up by Emperor Cang, Emperor Yun, and the martial sovereign of the DI family. They were suitable for the human race to reproduce and cultivate.</p><p>Outside of the cloud Mountain range, there were other monarch-level forces, but they were far away from the three prefectures.</p><p>In the past, the three great forces were in a standoff, and no one could do anything to the other.</p><p>Ever since Emperor Cang’s incident, the strength of the Azure continent had plummeted. However, the cloud Emperor mountain and the DI clan kept each other in check and confronted each other. The Azure continent was able to survive between the two forces and maintain a strange stability.</p><p>Neither the cloud Emperor mountain nor the DI family could lay a finger on the Azure region. If one side sent out their troops to attack the Azure region, the other side would take advantage of the situation.</p><p>Moreover, Emperor Yun and the martial sovereigns of the DI family were all about the same in strength, and neither of them could do anything to the other.</p><p>But now, Emperor Yun was killed and the Cloud King Mountain was destroyed. In this way, the balance was completely broken and no one could stop the DI family.</p><p>it must be the evil spirit cult. The great emperor of the evil spirit cult must have helped the great emperor of the DI family to kill Emperor Yun!</p><p>it’s over, it’s over. I can’t win against evil spirit in the end!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>They knew that the cloud Emperor mountain had been destroyed and the DI family had sent a large number of experts here. They had no chance.</p><p>“Why are you talking so much nonsense with them? just exterminate them!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect shouted.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, two figures appeared in the air. They were both wearing black robes.</p><p>One of them was a white-haired old man, and the other was a thin old woman.</p><p>“Greetings to the two elders!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect hurriedly bowed when he saw the two of them.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts sank even more.</p><p>Every elder of evil spirit was at the peak of the Saint realm. They were extremely terrifying. Now, two more had come. The other party was too strong. They had no chance.</p><p>The white-haired elder nodded. Then, he swept his gaze over the cloud Dragon Valley master and the others. my evil spirit religion has returned. We’re still weak and need all the power we can get. As long as you surrender and work for my evil spirit religion, I can spare you!</p><p>Many people’s hearts moved, and their eyes flickered.</p><p>If they fought today, only death would await them. Rather than being killed, it would be better to join evil spirit.</p><p>of course, everyone who seeks refuge will place a seal on your soul or your spiritual God. As long as you dare to resist, your soul will be destroyed and you will die with a single thought!</p><p>The white-haired old man’s voice turned cold.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned ugly. If a spirit or a spirit God had a restriction placed on them, they would really have no freedom at all and would have to obey evil spirit.</p><p>alright, I’ll give you three minutes to consider whether to surrender or not. Surrender and you’ll live. If you don’t, you’ll die!</p><p>The white-haired elder announced.</p><p>Many people’s faces were ugly. Their eyes flickered as they looked around.</p><p>However, they had been completely surrounded. There were too many experts from the DI family and the original members of evil spirit. They had no chance.</p><p>The difference was too great. It was impossible to break out of the encirclement. If they attacked, they would only die.</p><p>As time passed, the atmosphere became more and more solemn.</p><p>Very quickly, three minutes were about to pass.</p><p>I’m willing to surrender. The entire heavenly God sect is willing to surrender!</p><p>A voice rang out. It was the sect master of the tianshen sect. He was the first to speak.</p><p>good, a wise man knows when to act. You all step forward, I will set up a restriction on your soul or spiritual God!</p><p>The skinny old woman spoke, her voice harsh and unpleasant.</p><p>Although the sect master of the tianshen sect was unwilling, he still led the experts of the tianshen sect forward.</p><p>The skinny old woman stepped down and stretched out her hand to touch the forehead of the sect master of the heavenly God sect. Dense inscriptions entered the forehead of the sect master of the heavenly God sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
