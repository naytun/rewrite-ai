Xu Huo roared as he was about to fly out of the fighting ring. The horn between his brows glowed and flew out. It turned into a saber and slashed at the ice Soul clan’s Paragon.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Paragon let out a blood-curdling screech as he was struck. He was forced to retreat and fell off the fighting ring with Xu Huo.</p><p>After Xu Huo fell off the fighting ring, he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He quickly took out a healing divine pill and consumed it to heal his injuries.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s prodigy was even more severely injured and almost died. An ice Soul Clan Overlord quickly saved his life.</p><p>In this battle, both sides suffered losses.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion had defeated the four of them.</p><p>After this battle, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sent out another heaven’s favorite. His strength was not weaker than Xu Huo’s.</p><p>On the Qin heaven Starfield’s side, they had learned their lesson this time. They had more people and used a method of attrition. At the start, they didn’t seek to win but rather to exhaust the other party’s divine power.</p><p>Just like this, after the Qin heaven Starfield’s side lost two people in a row, the third person and the other party both suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>This way, there were only seven people left from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>While the Qin heaven Starfield had expended seven people, leaving only eleven people.</p><p>The difference in numbers between the two sides was rapidly closing. The situation was becoming more and more disadvantageous to the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>“Next, I’ll do it!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, Qin wuyou stepped onto the battle platform.</p><p>they’ve mobilized a Divine Son level character!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes focused.</p><p>Qin wuyou landed on the fighting ring and his gaze landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, get down here and fight me!”</p><p>Qin wuyou shouted coldly. He didn’t even try to hide his cold killing intent.</p><p>“You’re not qualified for me to make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. He had no intention of making a move.</p><p>There were definitely stronger heaven’s favorites in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It was not a good time for him to make a move.</p><p>He couldn’t reveal his strength too early. He could only take action at the critical moment to settle the situation.</p><p>This battle concerned the safety of the Qin heaven Star Zone. Naturally, Lu Ming would not act on impulse.</p><p>However, the others did not know what Lu Ming was thinking. They thought that Lu Ming was afraid.</p><p>“I’m not qualified for you to make a move? Hahaha, I really don’t know if you’re arrogant or ignorant!”</p><p>Qin wuyou laughed, his eyes extremely cold.</p><p>He was an existence who could control divine-grade divine power. Lu Ming actually said that he was not qualified for Lu Ming to make a move? It was simply laughable.</p><p>“I’m just telling the truth!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“This … He’s really shameless!”</p><p>Now, the people from the Qin heaven Star Zone were naturally on Lu Ming’s side. However, at this moment, they could not help but sigh. Lu Ming was really shameless.</p><p>He obviously didn’t dare to make a move, but he said that the other party wasn’t qualified for him to make a move.</p><p>In the past, the other party was a figure who had fought with grayflame Army destroyer. Was such a person not enough for Lu Ming to fight?</p><p>He was too full of himself!</p><p>Of course, that was what everyone thought. At this time, they would not help Qin wuyou to force Lu Ming.</p><p>“In order to survive, you really can say anything!”</p><p>Qin wuyou was furious, but Lu Ming refused to do anything. He had no choice but to look at the others and roared, ” “Who wants to fight me?”</p><p>“Who should we send?”</p><p>Ice fairy, red flame demonic pine, mo jiuye, and the others began to discuss.</p><p>this Qin wuyou is very strong. I don’t have the confidence to fight him!</p><p>Cangyan pojun frowned.</p><p>Of course, they had discussed this through telepathy.</p><p>I think we can’t waste our advantage in numbers. Let them waste this person’s divine power first, then we’ll attack and take him down! the elder said.</p><p>Mo jiuye said.</p><p>Now, they still had eleven people.</p><p>Other than the six of them, ice fairy, Scarlet Flame demonic pine, mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, ashen flame Army breaker, and Lu Ming, the other five were all sixth level celestial deity Holy Sons.</p><p>He was definitely no match for a heaven’s favorite like Qin wuyou, but he could exhaust his divine power.</p><p>“The ice Soul Clan is the best in terms of fighting and consuming the opponent’s divine power!”</p><p>Scarlet Flame demon pine laughed indifferently.</p><p>Ice immortal’s face darkened slightly. The red flame demon pine was obviously up to no good.</p><p>It was extremely dangerous to let someone exhaust Qin wuyou’s divine power now. One careless mistake and there was a risk of death.</p><p>that’s right. I think so too. No one is more suitable than the ice Soul Clan to consume divine power!</p><p>Mo jiuye chimed in.</p><p>Several people spoke in succession, and ice immortal was also helpless.</p><p>Ice Lake, it’s your turn. Remember, be careful and only fight with your opponent. If the situation doesn’t look good, charge down the fighting stage and admit defeat!</p><p>The ice immortal looked at a young man from the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Bing Hu nodded and leaped onto the fighting stage, standing far away from Qin wuyou.</p><p>“You actually sent such a piece of trash to fight me? what? Are you trying to exhaust my divine power first? Hehe, what a joke!”</p><p>Qin wuyou sneered as he saw through the thoughts of the ice immortal and the others.</p><p>“Ten thousand miles of ice!”</p><p>ice sword! Bing Hu took the lead and slammed his palm on the fighting ring. Endless coldness emerged and froze the entire fighting ring. Sharp ice swords were stuck in the fighting ring.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, countless ice swords formed and flew toward Qin wuyou.</p><p>“Small tricks, break for me!”</p><p>die! Qin wuyou shouted coldly as his body exploded with dazzling light. His terrifying divine power formed a wave of divine power that rushed out.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ice sword that was charging at him, as well as the surrounding ice, exploded in an instant.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>Qin wuyou stepped forward and threw a punch at the frozen lake.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed, all the ice shattered, turning into fragments that flew everywhere.</p><p>The fist force didn’t stop and continued to press down on the ice Lake.</p><p>“Ice sword slash!”</p><p>ice sword! Bing Hu shouted as he clenched his fists in the air. Endless cold intent gathered and formed a huge ice sword, slashing down at Qin wuyou’s fist force.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ice sword collided with the fist force, causing a violent vibration. But in the next moment, Bing Hu’s body trembled. The ice sword in his hand exploded, and his body was sent flying back. He coughed up blood in mid-air.</p><p>The two of them were both at the sixth level heavenly God Realm, but one of them controlled the divine grade divine power while the other controlled the divine grade divine power. The difference in their combat strength was truly shocking.</p><p>Ice Lake was completely outmatched. They were completely crushed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Qin wuyou shouted coldly. His body turned into a stream of light as he charged towards the frozen lake.</p><p>“Not good, Ice Lake, quickly retreat, get off the fighting stage!”</p><p>Ice immortal’s expression changed drastically as she quickly sent a message to Bing Hu.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” what? ”   Bing Hu was shocked as well. &Nbsp; he used all his divine power to retreat and rush off the stage.</p><p>However, he had just been sent flying, and his body was no longer as agile. It was too late to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Qin wuyou shouted as he threw out his fists. A terrifying fist force broke out of his body and headed toward the frozen lake.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the fist force was in front of Bing Hu.</p><p>In such a situation, Ice Lake could only defend with all its might.</p><p>In front of him, he had set up a shield made of nine layers of ice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
