Are you trying to start a war with the Wu family by killing us? ”</p><p>Wu Yue shouted.</p><p>“If I kill all of you, who will know who killed you?”</p><p>The other party sneered.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue’s faces were pale with despair.</p><p>The enemy had even sent out Divine King Warriors. Today, they would die for sure.</p><p>“Twelve half-step divine kings and one divine King. It’s almost certain that they will be able to kill us heavenly gods. Since we are dead for sure, can you tell me who sent you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, pretending to be in despair.</p><p>“Kid, don’t try to trick us. We won’t tell you!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. It did not come from the divine King, but from behind Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue’s expressions changed as they hurriedly turned around.</p><p>A man in a long robe with blood-red edges had appeared behind them. He was a skinny middle-aged man, but the aura that emanated from his body was extremely terrifying.</p><p>God King!</p><p>Yet another god King. The other party had actually sent out two God kings.</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue had completely given up.</p><p>The other party’s actions were simply flawless, sending out two God kings.</p><p>Furthermore, they didn’t appear all at once. First, one of them would be dispatched while the other would hide in the dark to check the situation. After confirming that there were no problems, the other God King would appear.</p><p>Two divine kings, one in front and one behind, surrounded them. There were also twelve half-step divine kings. Lu Ming and the rest were doomed with such a formation.</p><p>Lu Ming also pretended to look miserable. He sighed and said, ” two godkings. What a grand plan. Is there any more? come out together!</p><p>“We have enough people to kill you all!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man behind said.</p><p>since we’re dead for sure, can you tell me why you want to kill me? is it for revenge, or is it for something I have? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>He wanted to take the opportunity to get some clues from the other party.</p><p>However, the two Divine King realm men remained expressionless and silent, not revealing any information.</p><p>However, Lu Ming caught the expressions of the few half-step divine kings in the blood-rimmed robes.</p><p>When Lu Ming asked this question, a few half-step divine kings in blood-red robes subconsciously glanced at the storage ring on Lu Ming’s finger.</p><p>He was not seeking revenge. He still wanted to take something from Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming made a judgment instantly.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>“Don’t waste your breath on him. Let’s complete the mission first!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man shouted from behind, exuding a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A terrifying Saber Light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“QiuQiu, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and QiuQiu flew behind him.</p><p>“Just leave the two first level Divine King realm fellows to me!”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s mind. Then, its body swelled up and turned into a huge metal ball, charging forward.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>QiuQiu’s Saber Light was shattered by QiuQiu’s attack. It didn’t stop and charged toward the skinny middle-aged man.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man was shocked.</p><p>He didn’t expect that his attack would be destroyed by a metal ball.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>QiuQiu shouted loudly. Its huge body pressed down like a mountain.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man reacted and slashed out with his saber.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>This blade struck QiuQiu’s body, but it didn’t split QiuQiu’s body apart as he had expected. Instead, it was his own body that trembled violently and he retreated repeatedly, his arm numb.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>QiuQiu stretched out two tentacles, which turned into two battle sabers, and madly slashed toward the skinny middle-aged man.</p><p>In an instant, he had slashed out hundreds of times.</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man fought back with all his might.</p><p>Thump thump thump …</p><p>The two of them collided continuously, but the skinny middle-aged man was completely outmatched. He blocked a few moves with all his might before QiuQiu slashed him horizontally. His body was cut in two and he almost died.</p><p>“Damn it, how is this possible?”</p><p>At this moment, the divine King in front of Lu Ming seemed to have woken up from a dream and was shouting loudly.</p><p>“Kill, quickly kill that brat!”</p><p>The skinny man was cut in half by QiuQiu, but he didn’t die. He roared loudly at this moment.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The king of gods in front of Lu Ming shouted and attacked. A terrifying Saber Light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear, exploding all his strength and slashing out.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he had been hit by an archaic divine mountain. His body shook violently. His body, which was hundreds of meters tall, was forced to retreat. He felt the qi and blood in his body churning and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>A Divine King was much more powerful than a divine realm expert and even a half-step Divine King. Lu Ming was no match for a Divine King with his current cultivation base.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming retreated, Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue were exposed to the other party.</p><p>“I’ll kill the three of you first!”</p><p>The other party shouted coldly and slashed out.</p><p>A terrifying blood-red blade light slashed towards Qiu Yue and the other two.</p><p>If they were hit, they would definitely die with their cultivation.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“Leave it to me …”</p><p>QiuQiu opened its mouth, and then bolts of lightning spread out from its round body.</p><p>滋滋…</p><p>A bolt of lightning as thick as an arm burst forth and charged toward the divine King in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The speed of the lightning was extremely fast. In a flash, it arrived first and bombarded the opponent’s Saber Light.</p><p>With a pfft, the opponent’s Saber Light was extinguished. The lightning did not stop and bombarded the opponent’s body.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill scream was heard, and then there was no more sound.</p><p>When the lightning disappeared, all that could be seen was a charred corpse floating in the air. There was no sign of life at all. The next moment, the charred corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>A Godking had died just like that!</p><p>At this moment, the skinny man and the other men in blood-red robes had a drastic change in their expressions.</p><p>To kill a God King with a single move, what kind of cultivation was this?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The skinny middle-aged man shouted and half of his body retreated in an attempt to escape.</p><p>“Did I let you go? die!”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice rang out as it slashed out with its saber.</p><p>This blade carried traces of lightning.</p><p>The scrawny man let out a blood-curdling screech and followed in the footsteps of the previous God King, being struck into a charred corpse.</p><p>Yet another Godking had died!</p><p>The twelve half-step Divine King realm men in blood-red robes were shocked and ran away in all directions.</p><p>“If you want to escape, then stay behind!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and chased after his opponent.</p><p>At the same time, QiuQiu also chased after it. It opened its mouth, and bolts of lightning shot out like an electric net.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
