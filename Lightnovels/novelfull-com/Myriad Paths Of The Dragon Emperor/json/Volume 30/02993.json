He stood straight and didn’t retreat, but his face was a little pale.</p><p>He stepped forward and continued to walk inside.</p><p>“He passed, he passed!”</p><p>he really passed through the heaven Gate. That’s amazing. Jin Yuan, who entered star-moon ancient city this time, is probably one of the strongest heaven’s favorites!</p><p>indeed. A half-step Divine King has awakened the origin divine power factor. He is almost invincible under the divine King realm!</p><p>Many people looked at Jin Yuan with deep fear.</p><p>As half-step divine kings, those who had not awakened the origin divine power factor would probably not be able to take a single blow from Jin Yuan if they did not have terrifying secret techniques.</p><p>In the end, Jin Yuan stepped into the passage and turned to look in their direction.</p><p>He also wanted to see if there was anyone else who could pass through the heavenly gate.</p><p>gold ingot, you’ve got some skills. Let me give it a try!</p><p>At this moment, another young man stepped out.</p><p>This young man was wearing an animal skin coat and had the appearance of a nouveau riche.</p><p>However, no one dared to underestimate this person.</p><p>This was because the aura that this person exuded was also extremely terrifying. It was filled with an ancient aura, which was quite similar to the aura that Jin Yuan exuded.</p><p>Origin divine power factor!</p><p>Many people were shocked. This person was also a peerless genius who had awakened the origin of divine power.</p><p>This was because the origin divine power was the divine power controlled by the original gods. It was ancient and once the origin divine power factor was awakened, it would naturally emit an ancient and desolate aura.</p><p>This time, two people had actually awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>This person was very direct and also stepped into the heavenly gate.</p><p>He stopped halfway and woke up a moment later. He had successfully passed through the heavenly gate in the same time as Jin Xing.</p><p>Their gazes collided, and sparks flew.</p><p>However, everyone’s shock did not stop.</p><p>That was because two more heaven’s favorites stepped out and walked towards the heaven Gate. They passed.</p><p>They had all awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>this batch isn’t bad. There are actually four people below the God King level who have awakened the origin divine power factor!</p><p>Bai Li smiled.</p><p>Those who were able to awaken the origin divine power factor while still below the Godking level had a limitless future.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we’ll go too!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue said. Then, they went up with the other Wu family’s Supreme talents.</p><p>As a result, Wu Ming and Wu Yue finally passed through the human gate despite their injuries.</p><p>As for the woo family, one of their elites had passed the earth gate.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go too. Which door do you want to go through?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Young master, I want to try the Heaven’s Gate!”</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her eyes and looked at the Heaven’s Gate curiously.</p><p>“Then let’s try!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Although the Heaven’s Gate was dangerous, he believed in Qiu Yue.</p><p>If Jin Yuan and the others could pass, he didn’t believe that Qiu Yue couldn’t.</p><p>Although Qiu Yue had not awakened the origin divine power factor, she had awakened the nine-orifice Saint heart.</p><p>He was only at the first heaven, and his talent could not be compared to the nine-orifice Saint heart.</p><p>“Young master, I’ll go over and wait for you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled and floated out.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up when they saw Qiu Yue. However, in the next moment, everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>Qiu Yue was actually walking towards the heaven Gate.</p><p>“She … She … You want to enter the heavenly gate?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed and stuttered.</p><p>Even Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others were shocked.</p><p>“Lady Qiuyue, you can’t. This gate is extremely dangerous!”</p><p>Wu Ming could not help but call out.</p><p>that’s right, young lady. This is not a joke. It’s life-threatening!</p><p>“We have to be careful!”</p><p>The others also chimed in. Qiu Yue was so beautiful, it would be a pity if she died.</p><p>“Thank you, but I want to try!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled and continued to walk into the heaven Gate. An aura emanated from her body.</p><p>second level celestial deity. Her cultivation is only at the second level celestial deity realm!</p><p>with such a low cultivation, it’s impossible to awaken the origin divine power factor. What a pity, what a pity!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>They thought that Qiu Yue was most likely going to die.</p><p>Soon, Qiu Yue arrived at the center of the heaven Gate and stopped.</p><p>Everyone watched with rapt attention.</p><p>Although many people thought that it was impossible for Qiu Yue to pass, they still hoped that she would pass. After all, it was a pity for such a beautiful woman to die Here.</p><p>Time slowly passed by!</p><p>About five minutes passed.</p><p>“Look, she’s moving!”</p><p>“How is it? Eh, that’s not right!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue moved. However, she was not blasted out as expected. Instead, she stood there steadily.</p><p>Did he pass?</p><p>That’s impossible, right?</p><p>However, at the next moment, they had no choice but to accept this fact because Qiu Yue turned around and smiled at Lu Ming. She said,”Young master, I’ll head over first!”</p><p>With that, he floated forward and landed on the passage.</p><p>He really passed?</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>A second level heavenly deity who had not awakened the origin divine power factor was actually able to pass through the heavenly gates. How terrifying was his talent?</p><p>Many young men’s eyes were burning with desire.</p><p>With such talent and beauty, many people’s hearts began to burn.</p><p>If he could get such a beauty to be his wife, how cool would that be?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Following that, many people’s gazes could not help but land on Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Qiu Yue had addressed Lu Ming as young master.</p><p>Such a beautiful and talented person was actually someone else’s maidservant.</p><p>“This brat, what capabilities does he have?”</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll have to find a chance to warn this kid!”</p><p>Many people snorted coldly in their hearts and began to think of some ideas.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally noticed these gazes, but he ignored them and said, ” “Qiuyue, I’ll be right there!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming stepped out. The door he was walking towards was naturally the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>“What? This kid also used the heavenly gate?”</p><p>it can’t be. Does he think it’s that easy to get to the Heaven’s Gate? ”</p><p>“I don’t believe that he can pass through the Heaven’s Gate!”</p><p>Many people murmured and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people could tell that his cultivation was at the fourth level of the celestial deity realm.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Qiu Yue could pass the test. They did not believe that Lu Ming could pass it too.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>This included Jin Xing, Jin Yuan, and some of the Qin clan’s geniuses.</p><p>I hope this kid dies in the Heaven’s Gate!</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s elites sneered.</p><p>If Lu Ming had died in the sky Gate, they would not have to take action.</p><p>Bai Li’s gaze also fell on Lu Ming. He was extremely curious.</p><p>He was already very surprised when Qiu Yue passed the sky Gate. Could Lu Ming pass it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
