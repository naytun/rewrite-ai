His body was shrouded in divine power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Step by step, he carefully entered the human gate.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The moment he stepped into the human gate, the human gate trembled slightly and emitted a dazzling light. Then, a divine light flew towards this person.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The man roared, and divine power exploded out. He pushed out with both hands, and a ferocious beast pounced forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine light struck the beast, causing a violent boom. The beast trembled violently.</p><p>“Block it, block it …”</p><p>The young man roared and used all his strength. However, the next moment, the beast exploded. The young man groaned and retreated. A wound appeared on his chest, and it went straight through his bones.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The young man roared, his eyes filled with an unyielding look.</p><p>He had to succeed. He had to enter through the human gate. Otherwise, if he wanted to enter star-moon ancient city and obtain the Fortune, he had to enter through the dog gate. This was something that he found hard to accept.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He had once again stepped into the human world.</p><p>However, the human gate wouldn’t show any mercy. It continued to glow, and a divine light blasted towards him.</p><p>This time, the young man’s situation was even worse. His body was almost split apart, and he was forced out of the gate and heavily fell to the ground. His aura was weak, but he managed to keep his life. A young man who was familiar with him gave him a divine pill to heal his injuries.</p><p>“I’m telling you, if you can’t do it, don’t force yourself. Be careful not to lose your lives here!”</p><p>Bai Li said coldly.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned ugly. Did they really have to enter through the dog gate?</p><p>“I’ll try!”</p><p>Then, another new member stepped through the human gate. However, this person was sent flying out of the human gate like the previous one, but his injuries were lighter.</p><p>hehe, those without talent better not come forward. Obediently leave through the dog gate, in case you get injured!</p><p>An old member said with a smile.</p><p>that’s right. I wonder how many of the new members will pass through the dog gate. Haha!</p><p>Another senior member laughed in disdain.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice was heard, and a young man in a blood-red robe stepped out.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized the man. He was Wu Xue’s senior brother.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Many of the new members ‘eyes lit up.</p><p>The blood-robed young man was definitely the best among this batch of new members. If he could not enter through the human gate, then most of the new members would probably enter through the dog gate.</p><p>The blood-robed young man’s face was cold, and his body was covered in blood-red divine power. Step by step, he stepped into the human gate.</p><p>Just like before, when the blood-robed young man stepped through the human gate, the human gate lit up. A divine light shot towards the blood-robed young man.</p><p>“Blood pool abyss!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man roared and pushed his hands out. In front of him, a deep abyss appeared.</p><p>In the abyss, there was a blood-red mist rolling, giving off a terrifying aura.</p><p>The abyss spread forward and enveloped the divine light from the human gate.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Within the abyss, there were loud rumbles and constant quakes, as if it was going to explode at any moment.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” stop!   the blood-robed youth shouted, his divine power constantly circulating. The veins on his face bulged as he tried to stabilize the blood pool.</p><p>Slowly, the quaking in the abyss slowed down and finally disappeared.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>The blood-robed young man let out a long breath and looked overjoyed. He took a deep breath and continued to step forward.</p><p>After that, the human gate was very stable. There was nothing unusual. The blood-robed young man passed through the human gate smoothly and came to the common passage behind the four doors.</p><p>It passed!</p><p>Many of the new members were overjoyed.</p><p>Finally, someone passed. As long as they passed, it meant that it was not an impossible task.</p><p>“The power will be different as the cultivation level changes!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Through his observation just now, Lu Ming discovered that the cultivation levels of the previous batches of people who entered the human gate were different. However, the power that erupted from the human gate would also be different.</p><p>The higher one’s cultivation, the stronger the power.</p><p>No wonder Bai Li said that the test of the four doors had nothing to do with cultivation, but with talent.</p><p>This gate could test one’s talent.</p><p>After the blood-robed young man passed through the passageway, he did not immediately enter star-moon ancient city. Instead, he stood there and watched.</p><p>He wanted to see who would be able to pass through the earth gate and if anyone would be able to pass through the sky Gate.</p><p>“I’ll …”</p><p>Following that, more and more people stepped forward. However, they were all new members. The old members had no intention of making a move and were just watching from the side.</p><p>Most of the new members had chosen the human sect.</p><p>Some people failed, while others succeeded.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that less than half of the people could pass through the human gate.</p><p>Most of them had failed.</p><p>Those who had failed walked to the side dejectedly, not planning to pass through the dog door immediately.</p><p>Even if he wanted to pass through the dog gate, he had to wait until the end. With so many people watching, how embarrassing would that be?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Right at this moment, a figure stepped out, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>This was because this person was not stepping toward the human gate, but the earth gate.</p><p>“Jin Xing!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The person who stepped into the Earth’s gate was Jin Xing.</p><p>“It’s him, Jin Xing of the Jin family!”</p><p>The others also recognized Jin Xing.</p><p>it’s said that Jin Xing is one of the four most outstanding members of the Jin family’s younger generation. Although he’s young, his talent is extremely terrifying!</p><p>that’s right. The Jin family is amazing. There are many geniuses, especially in this generation. There are four terrifying heaven’s favorites. Each one is more monstrous than the last!</p><p>“I wonder if Jin Xing will be able to pass through the earth gate!”</p><p>Many people were discussing this.</p><p>The Jin family was one of the top families in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They were very powerful.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on Jin Xing.</p><p>Jin Xing’s entire body was covered in golden light, making him look like a man of Gold.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity!</p><p>Back then, in the Qin heaven Starfield, Jin Xing’s cultivation level was at the sixth level heavenly deity. Now, he had reached the seventh level heavenly deity.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Finally, he stepped into the earth gate.</p><p>The earth gate trembled slightly. Then, a bright light filled the air. A few beams of divine light shot towards Jin Xing.</p><p>There was only one divine light in the human gate, while there were three in the earth gate, and the light seemed to be more resplendent.</p><p>“Void severing hand!”</p><p>Jin Xing roared. Both of his palms turned golden and he struck out continuously.</p><p>A terrifying whistling sound erupted in the air. The power of the void-breaking hand was extremely shocking. It collided with the three beams of light from the Earth’s gate.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>With three terrifying explosions, the void exploded, and the force spread in all directions. Jin Xing’s entire body was golden, and it was extremely dazzling.</p><p>“Did you block it?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts were in their throats as they watched with wide eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the light dimmed. Everyone saw Jin Xing standing upright on the earth gate, uninjured.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“He can pass through the earth gate!”</p><p>This time, even many of the older members were surprised.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
