BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>This energy was too powerful. As it rushed out, a large number of Shanghai guards didn’t even have time to react before their bodies exploded and their souls scattered.</p><p>At least three hundred demonic city guards had died under this move, and the entire formation had been scattered.</p><p>As soon as the formation was opened, the power of the three great demon kings and the demon capital guards was scattered.</p><p>Lu Ming would not miss such an opportunity.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He stomped on the ground and his body, which was a few hundred meters tall, shot up. The divine power that had been stored in the ” quantity ” formula surged into Lu Ming’s body and was drawn out along his arms.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and swept out with his spear. The huge long spear was thousands of miles long and it enveloped a large number of Shanghai guards.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>One by one, the Shanghai guards exploded in the air like Rotten Tomatoes, blood splattering everywhere.</p><p>This spear attack had killed at least five hundred Magic City guards.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>“Damn it!” Dragon Cave and the other two demon masters roared in their hearts, unable to remain calm.</p><p>At this moment, apart from all evil, the other two demon masters were filled with regret. If they had known that Lu Ming was so terrifying, they would have listened to all evil and burned their divine power to kill Lu Ming in one fell swoop.</p><p>However, it was too late to regret now!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming fixed his eyes on the three demon masters. He thrust his long spear at the demon master of the Dragon Cave, who was the closest to him.</p><p>The spear light was like a shooting star, instantly approaching the demon Lord of the Dragon Cave.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>The demon Lord of the Dragon Cave was shocked. He quickly waved his hands and used his strongest move to block.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming was a third-tier celestial God, his strength was already enough to suppress a half-step Divine King demon master. Now that he had broken through to the fourth-tier celestial God Realm, his combat strength was even more overwhelming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance pierced through the attack of the demon Lord of the Dragon Cave and continued to stab toward him.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The demon Lord of the Dragon Cave was pierced by the spear light, leaving a bloody hole.</p><p>The Dragon Cave’s Demon Lord screamed as his body was sent flying. He had been severely injured.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not give the demon Lord of the Dragon Cave any chance. He stepped forward and aimed his long spear at the demon Lord’s head.</p><p>The demon master of the Dragon Cave was already severely injured. How could he Dodge? with a scream, his head was smashed by Lu Ming and he died on the spot.</p><p>A demon master was killed just like that.</p><p>In the surroundings, many of the demon City guards were almost scared to death. They didn’t have the slightest bit of battle intent as they turned around and ran, not daring to stay in the slightest.</p><p>“Go, quickly go!”</p><p>Not to mention the demonic city guards, even Wan E was extremely terrified. He brought Wan Xing and fled in a frenzy.</p><p>The other demon master also fled in another direction.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>With a cold shout, a sword light rushed out of the gravel below and slashed at the escaping demon master.</p><p>“En, I didn’t expect that there would be such a heaven’s favorite who was captured and brought to the spirit beast arena!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The one who made a move was a young man with peak seventh level celestial deity cultivation. But his combat strength was very shocking, and he actually held back that demon master. Such strength was already not weaker than Pei Lin.</p><p>Obviously, for some unknown reason, this young man had also been captured by the other party and brought to the animal arena.</p><p>Magic City mountain was really audacious. They dared to do anything. They even dared to capture such a heaven’s pride expert. Did they rely on their backer?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing, but his figure chased after evil at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>He had to kill Wan Xing and Wan E.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   all evil was alarmed and madly burned his divine power to fly forward.</p><p>However, Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and it was as if he had transformed into a kun Peng. His speed was even faster than evil’s, and the distance between the two of them was rapidly closing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When he was within a certain distance, Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. A ray of spear light burst out and rushed towards all evil at high speed.</p><p>All evil had no choice but to stop and turn around to block.</p><p>Evil was burning his divine power and his combat strength was higher than usual. He blocked Lu Ming’s attack but his body was also pushed back. His face turned pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Your Shen power should be almost burnt out!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and looked down on all evil and all good.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ming’s body that was a few hundred meters tall, all evil and Wan Xing were like ants.</p><p>“Father, father, what should we do? What do we do?”</p><p>Wan Xing was almost scared to death. His entire body was trembling, and his face was extremely pale.</p><p>He was used to being tyrannical in the Colosseum and even in the demon capital. Not many people dared to go against him because of his evil reputation. He had always had a high and mighty appearance. When had he ever faced such a situation? at this moment, he was completely flustered and lost.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s something that you probably don’t know. My Magic City mountain has a backer in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He’s a real big Shot. If you kill us, the Big Shot of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion won’t let you off!”</p><p>Evil said coldly.</p><p>“The backer behind Magic City mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. As long as he knew who the backer behind Magic City mountain was, it was possible to find out who the traitor of nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was.</p><p>“Tell me, who is the backer of your Magic City mountain? Or, which force is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“Do you want to know who our backer is? You just need to know that we have a backer behind us, a backer that you can’t afford to offend. Otherwise, how could a treasure like the demon night spring have survived until now?”</p><p>Evil sneered and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“You don’t want to tell me? Then I’ll search for it myself!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of threats. After he finished speaking, he waved his long spear and swept it towards evil.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>All evil was shocked. He did not expect that Lu Ming would not be threatened at all. He could only resist with all his might.</p><p>However, he had been burning his divine power for so long and his divine power was severely depleted. He had only exchanged a few blows with Lu Ming before his divine power was completely depleted.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear struck evil’s body. The lower half of evil’s body exploded, leaving only the upper half floating in the air, its aura dispirited.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed at the void. A suction force was produced and Wan Xing was caught in his hand.</p><p>In Lu Ming’s hands, Wan Xing was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. He could not put up any resistance and could only scream in pain.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t kill me!”</p><p>father, father, save me, save me. I don’t want to die …</p><p>Wan Xing’s face was covered in snot and tears. He was so scared that he even peed himself.</p><p>When he killed others, he didn’t even blink. He was even very excited. When it was his turn, he was more afraid than anyone else.</p><p>“Don’t kill him!”</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>“Tell me, tell me who’s the backer of Magic City mountain, and I’ll consider letting him go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
