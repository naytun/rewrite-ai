He came to Magic City mountain only to check it out first. If he didn’t find any clues, he would go to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to investigate.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>Immediately, the four of them left Magic City mountain. After a long journey, they arrived at the core of Chu Tian star field. Then, they took the inter-star field teleportation formation and headed towards the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Chu Tian star field was still a long distance away from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Even if they were to travel in a straight line, they were still more than ten star fields away. How long was this distance?</p><p>They used nearly a year just to travel. Finally, they arrived at the territory near the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Then, they boarded the starry sky battleship and flew towards the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Gradually, a huge Galaxy appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest in the universe.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Looking at the Galaxy, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were stunned.</p><p>This Galaxy actually had three stars.</p><p>Most galaxies were fixed stars.</p><p>With a star as the core, the other planets would rotate around the star and form a solar system.</p><p>However, this Galaxy had three stars.</p><p>Huge planets were revolving around the three stars in a strange orbit.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance. There were at least thirty planets revolving around the three stars.</p><p>As the distance between them shortened, a scene that shocked Lu Ming even more appeared.</p><p>At the periphery of the entire Galaxy, the planets were shining with all kinds of light.</p><p>At the same time, there were many huge objects patrolling around the Galaxy. These huge objects gave off an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong’s faces were calm, clearly already used to it.</p><p>these huge objects are all war machines. They are extremely terrifying and can monitor the space around this Galaxy. Once they discover an enemy invasion, they will launch a thunderous counterattack. It is said that even peak Divine King existences will be killed!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>To be able to kill a peak God King, this level of power was truly shocking.</p><p>Any one of them would be able to crush the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>“Let’s go in. We’ll go to that planet first!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng pointed to a fiery red Planet at the outermost part of the Galaxy.</p><p>Lu Ming steered the starry sky warship and flew towards the fiery red Planet.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>With a cold shout, a team of strong men in fiery red armor appeared on the periphery of the planet, blocking Lu Ming and the rest’s path.</p><p>The aura that he exuded made Lu Ming and the rest fearful.</p><p>“Divine King. There are Divine King realm existences among them!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>There were twelve men in this group. Lu Ming could sense that at least three of them were at the divine King realm. The other nine were probably at the peak of the heavenly God Realm.</p><p>As expected of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. They were only the guards at the outermost perimeter. There were many God kings that appeared casually. Their strength was truly unfathomable.</p><p>“I’m Wu Zifeng, a disciple of the Wu family. These are my friends!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng flew out of the starry sky warship and took out an identity token.</p><p>they’re indeed the Wu family’s disciples. Where are they? have they ever been to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion before? if they haven’t, you have to leave behind their life aura!</p><p>A Divine King man said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng nodded.</p><p>On the way, Wu Zifeng had explained the procedure to enter the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Lu Ming was not surprised. He went forward with Qiu Yue and left their life aura on an array disc.</p><p>After leaving behind their life aura, the strong men in fiery red armor did not stop them and let Lu Ming and the rest enter the planet.</p><p>After entering the planet, they followed the other direction of the planet and flew towards the core of the Galaxy.</p><p>If one did not pass through this planet and barged in directly from another space in the Galaxy, they would be attacked by the war machines. Unless one’s cultivation surpassed the God King realm, one would not be able to survive.</p><p>He flew straight to the core of the star. Not long after, a huge planet appeared in front of him.</p><p>This planet was the largest in this Galaxy. Even from far away, one could feel the surging energy from this planet.</p><p>There was a Halo around each planet. From afar, it was very beautiful.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming could sense that energy was constantly being absorbed by this planet from all directions, even from the universe and the starry sky, and was gathering on this planet.</p><p>there’s a large formation on this planet that can absorb energy from the outside world!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>that’s right. This planet does have a large array that constantly absorbs the energy of the universe and gathers it on the planet, making the divine Qi on the planet extremely rich!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained and then smiled, this is the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. We’ve arrived!</p><p>“This is the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? The entire planet?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p><p>that’s right. The entire planet is the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>that’s right. Wu Zifeng nodded and explained, ” the entire planet is covered by a peerless formation. It’s like a huge mansion or a city!</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were shocked.</p><p>This was really a big deal.</p><p>As the distance between them shortened, Lu Ming finally realized that the entire planet was covered by a huge light shield.</p><p>However, in different directions of the planet, the light shield would open up a gap, like a door.</p><p>Wu Zifeng told him that there were a total of eight openings on the entire planet, which were eight gates, distributed in eight directions of the planet.</p><p>Each gate was guarded by a large number of experts.</p><p>with such tight defense, there’s actually still someone who can steal a precious treasure from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. Hehe!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming understood even more. If there was no one in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion cooperating, it was impossible for outsiders to steal the treasure.</p><p>There was definitely someone working with them.</p><p>They flew towards the nearest gate.</p><p>There were a large number of experts guarding the gate. They were all wearing battle armor and had a shocking aura.</p><p>“Godking, they’re all godkings!”</p><p>Lu Ming could sense a terrifying aura from these people. It was the aura of a God King.</p><p>These guards were actually all God kings.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue left behind a trace of life aura here before they were able to enter the door.</p><p>As soon as he entered the door, Lu Ming felt a strong divine aura blowing in his face.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath, feeling refreshed.</p><p>Cultivating here would definitely be much faster than cultivating outside.</p><p>“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to the Wu clan’s residence!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said and flew forward first.</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them followed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
