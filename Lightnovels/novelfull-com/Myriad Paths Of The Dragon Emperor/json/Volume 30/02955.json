He was a peak sixth level celestial deity and the divine energy he controlled was also divine-grade divine energy.</p><p>This person’s strength was even stronger than sword Dao Wuji and Mo jiuye of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>“Wild Blood Shadow Blade!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man would not admit defeat. However, he had seen the woman with the snake on her arm admit defeat earlier. He did not dare to be careless in the face of Lu Ming. He attacked with a killing move.</p><p>The saber shadows that filled the sky enveloped Lu Ming, wanting to kill him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had directly triggered a fourfold increase in combat power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fighting stage shook as the spear radiance shot up into the sky. The blood-red saber shadows that filled the sky instantly fell apart.</p><p>The blood-robed young man screamed and flew out of the fighting ring while spitting blood.</p><p>He was defeated in one move!</p><p>“What terrifying battle strength!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings gasped.</p><p>Especially the people from Magic City mountain. They had never seen such a powerful heaven’s favorite before, so they were naturally dumbfounded.</p><p>Even Wu Xue and the others became serious.</p><p>A third level celestial deity being able to unleash such battle prowess was truly shocking.</p><p>“He’s really powerful!”</p><p>In one of the battle rings, night rose licked her rosy lips as a fiery light flashed across her eyes, along with a wisp of … Greed.</p><p>After Lu Ming won, he returned to the No. 16 Coliseum.</p><p>The competition continued.</p><p>The burly youth who was holding the battle blade was called Pei Lin. He was an eighth-level celestial deity and had overpowered a seventh-level celestial deity to obtain victory.</p><p>The black-robed young man who used the spear was called su mu. He had also defeated his opponent and won.</p><p>Soon after, the wizard blood and the night rose also won.</p><p>Not long after, the top eight were born.</p><p>However, in order to select the top ten, they were short of two spots, so they had to choose from the eight people who had just been defeated.</p><p>Therefore, the eight people who had been defeated went through another round of competition and finally chose two spots for a total of ten people.</p><p>this King has said that if you enter the top ten, you will be able to obtain one Jin of demon night spring. Now, I will give it to you!</p><p>After saying that, the night Demon Lord waved his hand, and a Jade bottle appeared in front of him.</p><p>The Jade bottle was transparent, almost transparent, and one could see what was inside.</p><p>There was a black liquid in the Jade bottle.</p><p>Many people’s eyes burned with passion when they saw the Jade bottle.</p><p>Inside, it contained the demon night spring. It could nurture and strengthen the soul. It was priceless.</p><p>Of course, no one dared to make a move.</p><p>The night Demon Lord waved his hand and ten Jade bottles flew out, flying toward Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and grabbed a Jade bottle in his hand, putting it away without a sound.</p><p>alright, the competition will continue. It will still be one-on-one duels!</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced, and then began to draw lots.</p><p>“Number one, number six!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was not the first to appear.</p><p>No. 1, Pei Lin.</p><p>Number six was a seventh level celestial deity expert.</p><p>The two of them had a huge battle, but Pei Lin’s cultivation was higher and he won.</p><p>“Number 16, number 2!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>It was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>Lu Ming moved and flew up to the main fighting ring.</p><p>With a flash, a black-robed young man also jumped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. The black-robed young man was the one who used the long spear. His name was su mu.</p><p>you and I both use long Spears. Unfortunately, your cultivation is too weak. You are not my opponent!</p><p>Su mu was very confident.</p><p>He indeed had the capital to be confident. His cultivation was at the peak of the seventh level celestial deity realm, but his combat strength was exceptionally powerful. Even prodigies of the same level as him were not his match. Moreover, Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the third level celestial deity realm.</p><p>No matter how powerful Lu Ming was, he could still defeat him.</p><p>it’s too early to say that. We’ll only know after the battle!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Then I’ll fulfill your wish, Lightning Spear Divine Art!”</p><p>Su mu shouted, and a violent aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A dazzling Spear’s gleam turned into a bolt of Black Lightning and shot toward Lu Ming. It was so fast that it was not slower than lightning.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming made his move. He activated his fourfold combat strength and used the air-piercing move.</p><p>A ray of spear light pierced towards the other party like a meteor.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>The fighting ring was like a shooting star and a black lightning bolt. They collided with each other, creating an ear-piercing boom.</p><p>Then, a strong wind swept across the fighting ring. The Spear’s radiance burst out in all directions. The entire fighting ring was filled with colorful spear radiance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before the spear radiance had dissipated, the two figures retreated at the same time.</p><p>The difference was that su mu had only retreated about a hundred meters before he stopped, while Lu Ming had retreated a few kilometers.</p><p>Moreover, the battle platform was large enough, with a radius of a hundred miles. Otherwise, Lu Ming would have withdrawn from the battle platform.</p><p>you want to fight me with this little strength? get lost!</p><p>die! su mu shouted. His body seemed to have disappeared into thin air. Then, Black Lightning bolts shot toward Lu Ming from the fighting ring.</p><p>There were a total of 108 Black Lightning bolts, all of which were formed by su MU’s spear light.</p><p>the Spear’s light transformed into Black Lightning. How amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had seen such a way of using a gun.</p><p>The world was full of wonders.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” it seems like I can only use the ancient God Body!   Zhao Feng muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then cast the ancient God tactic.</p><p>An ancient God’s roar was heard and Lu Ming transformed into his ancient God Body.</p><p>However, he had only turned into an orange-armored ancient God.</p><p>The orange-armored ancient God was more than enough to deal with su mu!</p><p>that’s the ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming was recognized as soon as he used his ancient God Body.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” this kid has actually cultivated the ancient God Body!</p><p>Wu Xue’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability was stronger than he had imagined.</p><p>However, he was still confident that he could defeat Lu Ming. It would just take a little more effort.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>After transforming into the ancient God Body, Lu Ming continued to use the sky-breaking move. Rays of spear light burst out and headed toward su mu, colliding with the 108 Black Lightning bolts in the sky.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Like a needle against an awn, the sound of collision rang out in the fighting ring, and sparks flew in all directions.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming transformed into an ancient God Body, his combat strength soared and he had completely surpassed su mu.</p><p>After each collision, a black lightning bolt would collapse and disappear on the fighting ring.</p><p>The number of Black Lightning bolts on the fighting ring was decreasing.</p><p>One hundred and seven, one hundred and six …</p><p>The speed at which it was decreasing was shocking.</p><p>After a while, there was only one black Lightning left on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming bellowed as he swung his long spear down. A crescent-shaped spear radiance slashed at the black Lightning.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The black Lightning exploded, and su MU’s figure reappeared. His face was pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood as his body was sent flying.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped on the ground and his huge body chased after su mu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
