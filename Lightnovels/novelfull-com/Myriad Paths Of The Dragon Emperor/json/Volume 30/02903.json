You … Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>A genius from the unique demon Academy roared angrily.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>With a flash of the spear, the heaven’s favorite’s forehead was pierced and he died on the spot.</p><p>The other paragons immediately fell silent.</p><p>“If you don’t want to, I’ll send you on your way immediately. Who else?”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned his surroundings.</p><p>No one said a word. Lu Ming was too ruthless. He had no scruples at all. They had no doubt that if they rejected Lu Ming, they would be killed by him immediately.</p><p>“I’ll give you the time of ten breaths. If you still don’t agree after ten breaths, I can only send you on your way. Ten …”</p><p>“Nine …”</p><p>Lu Ming started to count down.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>……</p><p>In the end, the paragons of the unique demon Academy and the immortal sword sect all agreed. They then swore on their life source that they would be loyal to Lu Ming in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>There were a total of six people from the Yimo Academy and the immortal sword sect.</p><p>They were All Saints. One should know that there were only Seven Saints in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained the loyalty of six saints at once. Such people would definitely be useful in the future.</p><p>alright, don’t announce our relationship to the public. You are still the Holy Sons and holy virgins of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect. If I need you in the future, I will naturally contact you. Now, go!</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, he waved his hand and let everyone leave.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The six Saint-level heaven’s favorites bowed and nodded. Then, in a flash, they left the place.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re getting more and more powerful. With your current combat strength, I’m afraid you can fight against the divine Son-level geniuses of the three Overlord forces,”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang walked over with an envious expression.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I absorbed so much energy from the star core fragment!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled awkwardly.</p><p>Lu Ming had absorbed 90% of the energy from the star core fragment.</p><p>the star core fragment was obtained by you. I’m the one who’s sorry. I’m already very lucky to have absorbed so much energy and broken through one level.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang smiled.</p><p>this planet is the closest to the star. There might be other star core fragments. Let’s go and look again!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After coming to an agreement, Lu Ming put away the storage rings of four eyes void court and the others, then left the place with Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>However, their luck seemed to have run out, or perhaps there was only one star core fragment on this planet. In the next five or six days, they didn’t find a second star core fragment, nor did they find any array plates.</p><p>However, they had obtained quite a lot of precious metals. Lu Ming kept them without any hesitation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent explosion came from one direction, and at the same time, a terrifying force spread in this direction.</p><p>this is the fluctuation of divine power. There’s a battle in that direction!</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>with such shocking fluctuations, the person fighting must be very strong. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>The two of them concealed their auras and headed in that direction.</p><p>They had advanced for at least ten thousand miles, and the fluctuations in front of them were getting more and more intense.</p><p>Looking ahead, he saw three figures entangled together, attacking and fighting each other.</p><p>The fact that the shockwaves from the three’s fight could travel so far showed how powerful they were.</p><p>divine-grade divine power! It’s them! Mo jiuye! Boundless sword Dao! Ashen flames Army destroyer!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also froze.</p><p>The three people fighting at the front were mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and serpentine Army breaker, the three deity-level characters.</p><p>However, the three of them clearly did not use their full strength. They should have held back, so the battle was difficult to determine.</p><p>Below the three of them were other heaven’s favorites from the three Overlord forces.</p><p>In front of these people, there was a stone tower with nine floors and a closed door.</p><p>Mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and cangyan po Jun must have fought because of this stone pagoda.</p><p>The three of them exchanged dozens of moves in a row, then retreated and confronted each other from a distance.</p><p>“You two, anyone who sees it will have a share. How about the three of us enter this stone tower together?”</p><p>Sword Dao Wuji’s long hair fluttered in the wind, and his sword Qi soared into the sky like a sharp divine sword.</p><p>“Hmph, you sure know how to take advantage of the situation. I was the one who found this stone pagoda first,”</p><p>die! mo jiuye shouted coldly. His entire body was shrouded in black light, as if he was in the dark of night.</p><p>“So what if you discovered it first? You can’t even break through the stone pagoda’s door by yourself, what’s the use? in my opinion, we should attack together and break through the stone pagoda’s door. We can enter together and fight for the treasures inside with our own abilities. This is the fairest way!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun shouted. His entire body was covered in red armor and his body was covered in flames. The terrifying heat even distorted the space.</p><p>It was rumored that cangyan pojun had the blood of the Scarlet Flame tribe, but no one knew if it was true.</p><p>“I agree with brother Cang Yan’s suggestion!”</p><p>The sword Dao, Wuji Dao.</p><p>Mo jiuye’s expression was ugly, but he was helpless against sword Dao infinitum and Azure Flame breaks the ranks.</p><p>Neither sword Dao limitless nor blue flame breaking Army was any weaker than him.</p><p>well, it’s decided then. But before that, it seems that two uninvited guests have arrived!</p><p>When cangyan pojun finished speaking, he looked in the direction of Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>At the same time, mo jiuye and sword Dao Wuji also looked over with cold eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. The divine sons had unfathomable means. It was normal for them to notice them.</p><p>let’s go out and meet the Divine Child level people!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Since he had been discovered, there was no need to hide.</p><p>Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang walked out side by side.</p><p>“Brat, it’s you …”</p><p>The moment he saw Lu Ming, mo jiuye’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. An icy aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>He had come to this planet because he was chasing after Lu Ming. He did not expect Lu Ming to escape. Now that he saw Lu Ming, his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around but did not see Zhuo Buzhu. It seemed that Zhuo Buzhu had not met with sword Dao Wuji and the others. Naturally, mo jiuye did not know that Lu Ming had killed four eyes void court.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the Kong Xuan sect, hehe!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji also sneered, and the sword intent on his body became extremely cold.</p><p>In the world of ancient gods, Lu Ming had killed a Holy Son of the inextinguishable sword sect. Therefore, Lu Ming was also on his must-kill list.</p><p>“So what if it’s me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and strode forward. He looked calm and fearless.</p><p>very good, you still dare to come out. You’re seeking death. I’ll send you on your way now!</p><p>Mo jiuye’s expression was ferocious as he stepped forward. The black light all over his body condensed into a huge pitch-black Hand and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
