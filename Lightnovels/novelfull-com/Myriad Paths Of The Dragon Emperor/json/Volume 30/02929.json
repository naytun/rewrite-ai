Lu Ming wanted to improve himself to his strongest state.</p><p>Lu Ming needed to use the energy of the star core to break through to the next realm.</p><p>In the past two hundred years, Lu Ming did not use the energy from the star core. He had been absorbing energy to cultivate. Otherwise, his cultivation would not have improved so slowly.</p><p>After two hundred years, the ” quantity ” formula must have refined some of the energy, right?</p><p>“I did refine some, but not too much. It’s all because your cultivation is too low, which greatly reduced the speed of my refining!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula complained.</p><p>“It should be enough for me to break through to the second level celestial deity realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Why was he the one to blame in the end?</p><p>your cultivation has already reached peak first level celestial deity. Charging to second level celestial deity is naturally a matter of certainty. But you’re currently in control of ten types of divine power. Wanting to charge to third level celestial deity is hard to say!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“It already has so much energy? Come on, give it a try!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If he could increase his realm, his confidence would increase.</p><p>“Then I’m ready!”</p><p>The voice of the ‘measure’ formula was heard. Following that, the ‘measure’ word in his sea of consciousness emitted a dazzling radiance. A pure and rich energy surged out wildly and rushed into Lu Ming’s limbs and bones.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the universe thousand Dao Scripture at full force and began to absorb this energy to break through to the next realm.</p><p>This energy was too strong. Lu Ming felt his entire body swelling up and being filled with violent energy.</p><p>what a rich energy! Such a rich energy, but it’s only a small part of the star core!</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>This energy was extremely pure. Although it was extremely rich, the speed at which it was absorbed was also very fast.</p><p>Under the effect of the universal Dao Scripture, the energy was quickly absorbed and transformed into Lu Ming’s divine power. The ten divine flames in his dantian grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud boom in Lu Ming’s body and the ten divine flames were strung together.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming’s aura increased by a large margin.</p><p>Second level celestial deity, breakthrough!</p><p>After breaking through to the second-tier celestial God Realm, Lu Ming did not stop. There was still a lot of energy left in his body.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine this energy. His cultivation level was rapidly increasing.</p><p>Second level heavenly deity stable, early stage, middle stage …</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming charged to peak second level celestial deity.</p><p>He was not far from third level celestial deity either.</p><p>There was still some energy left in his body. However, it was still not enough to use it to charge for the third level celestial deity realm.</p><p>“Let’s do it in one go …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination. With a wave of his hand, a huge pile of divine crystals appeared on the ground.</p><p>These divine crystals were all mid-grade divine crystals, and the divine Qi within them was several times denser than low-grade divine crystals.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity. Lu Ming wanted to charge to the third-level celestial deity realm in one go.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>A large pile of divine crystals exploded and turned into divine Qi. Lu Ming opened his mouth and the divine Qi surged into his mouth like a tidal wave, which he swallowed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming began to put all his effort into refining this divine Qi.</p><p>He was going to use this divine Qi to complement the remaining energy from before and charge for the third level celestial deity realm.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had already accumulated a large amount of energy after refining the divine crystals.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>With a thought, he fused the energy from refining the divine crystal with the energy from before and started to charge towards the third level celestial deity realm.</p><p>……</p><p>Three months had passed, and a large number of creatures had gathered in the central square of planet thousand spirits.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region had all sorts of races, and it was filled with people.</p><p>This time, even many top experts from the major forces had arrived.</p><p>For example, the elders of the major forces were all observing in secret.</p><p>After all, this battle wasn’t just a battle between the younger generation. It also concerned the safety of the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s people are here!</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>In the distance, many beams of light flew over.</p><p>There were dozens of them.</p><p>Among them, there were more than a dozen older people, and they all seemed to be powerhouses with shocking strength.</p><p>The rest were all young people.</p><p>These people stood in the air above the fighting ring and looked around arrogantly.</p><p>Compared to the number of people around the square, their numbers were pitifully small. However, their aura had suppressed the Qin heaven Starfield’s side.</p><p>“Qin heaven Starfield, where are the people you want to send out? Come out!”</p><p>It was still the same golden-robed young man from last time. He stepped forward and his voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Ice immortal stepped out and appeared in the air.</p><p>Then, red flame magic pine, mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and the others all stepped out.</p><p>There were a total of 17 people.</p><p>Almost all of them were from the red flame clan, the ice Soul Clan, and the three Overlord forces.</p><p>“Only 17 people. You guys seem to be missing one person. Where’s that arrogant kid from last time? why didn’t he come?”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth’s gaze swept across the crowd as he laughed.</p><p>Ice immortal and the others looked at each other, and their eyes darkened.</p><p>They were indeed short of one person. That was because Lu Ming had not arrived.</p><p>“It’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming is not here!”</p><p>“What about Lu Ming? could it be that he doesn’t dare to come at such a critical moment?”</p><p>he definitely doesn’t dare to come. He has offended the Paragon of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. How would he dare to come? he’ll die if he comes!</p><p>I knew it. He’s just being stubborn and doesn’t dare to fight!</p><p>The people from the Qin heaven Star Zone mumbled. Most of them felt that Lu Ming would not dare to come.</p><p>hehe, that kid only knows how to rely on his mouth. He’s a coward!</p><p>Qin wuyou sneered.</p><p>“Who said that the young master doesn’t dare to come?”</p><p>At this time, a delicate shout came from the distance. Then, a few figures walked over.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others.</p><p>It was Qiu Yue who had just spoken.</p><p>A faint smile hung on Lu Ming’s face. Not long ago, he had finally charged to the third level celestial deity in one go. It was also because he was charging to the third level celestial deity that he had arrived a little later.</p><p>“He really dared to come?”</p><p>Many people’s gazes flickered, as if they had not expected this.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Qin wuyou’s eyes flashed with a ferocious light. He licked his lips and didn’t even try to hide his cold killing intent.</p><p>“You guys wait for me here!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue and the rest. He stepped forward and came to the side of the ice deity and the rest.</p><p>On the side of the Qin heaven Starfield, all 18 people had arrived.</p><p>“Where are your nine people? Who are the nine people?”</p><p>Ice immortal asked.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>As soon as ice immortal finished speaking, a young man stepped out from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Including the Golden-robed young man and Qin Wushang, there were nine people in total.</p><p>Nine people, seven men and two women.</p><p>Ice immortal and the others looked at the nine people with a serious expression.</p><p>Because they couldn’t see through some of them at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
