This was a serious crime. Wu Yue and Wu Ming immediately shouted and asked Jin Xing to show evidence.</p><p>there’s no need for evidence. The truth is right in front of you. What evidence do you need? ”</p><p>Jin Xing sneered and continued to accuse.</p><p>“Hehe, you want to convict someone with just your mouth? how ridiculous is that?”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He looked at Jin Xing in disdain and smiled evilly. since you insist that I stole the treasure, then fine, I admit that it was the Jin and Qin families who ordered me to do it. The Jin and Qin families wanted to rebel against their superiors!</p><p>Hearing this, the heaven’s favorites from the Jin and Qin families were shocked.</p><p>“Bullshit, you’re bullshitting!”</p><p>“You’re full of nonsense. I don’t believe a single word you say!”</p><p>Jin Xing, Qin Tian’s heaven’s chosen, roared.</p><p>“Oh? If you can open your mouth and say it, why can’t I? Since you’re suspicious of me stealing the treasure, then I’ll expose you for colluding with me. What’s suspicious about that? that’s normal. Otherwise, how can I steal the treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … Lu Ming … Damn it …”</p><p>Jin Xing roared angrily but he could not find any words to refute Lu Ming.</p><p>If he were to continue to slander Lu Ming for coming to the star sky Camp with ill intentions and for him to be related to the nine absolute divine crystal being stolen, Lu Ming would insist that the Jin family and Qin Tian were their helpers.</p><p>There was no evidence anyway, so he could just rely on his mouth.</p><p>Jin Xing’s face turned green and white. In the end, he didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor was not just one aristocratic family, but there were many ancient aristocratic families.</p><p>These aristocratic families worked together under the nine absolute Heavenly King residence, but they were in a competitive relationship and attacked each other.</p><p>He was afraid that if they continued to suppress Lu Ming, he would say whatever he wanted. It would not be good if the enemy families had a handle on him and attacked him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can continue hiding. Let’s see how long you can hide. This place can only be protected for a total of fifty years!”</p><p>Jin Xing snorted.</p><p>you talk too much nonsense. Come, come, come. Let’s fight at the same level. If you don’t fight, you’re a bastard!</p><p>Lu Ming raised his middle finger and beckoned.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the Jin and Qin families snorted and turned to leave.</p><p>brother Lu, you still have to be careful in the future. The Jin family and Qin family are very powerful in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Wu Ming warned.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After that, Wu Ming and Wu Yue bade their farewells and left. Lu Ming and Qiu Yue entered the courtyard and closed the door.</p><p>The courtyard was huge. It had a courtyard, a Pavilion, and seven to eight rooms.</p><p>The two of them each chose a room.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the room and sat cross-legged. He could feel a strange fluctuation coming from the top of the star Peak.</p><p>This wave could clear one’s mind and soul, speeding up the comprehension of divine skills and secret skills.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in the mood to comprehend the divine skills and secret skills.</p><p>He was thinking about the origin divine power factor!</p><p>there should be a library in the universal camp. There should also be a place to buy divine techniques. Let’s go and look!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He then got up and left the room. He soared into the sky and watched from afar.</p><p>On Star Peak, other than many courtyards, there were also many magnificent palaces. From afar, Lu Ming saw a Palace with people coming in and out. It was quite lively, so Lu Ming flew towards it.</p><p>After arriving here, he discovered that this place was a Market City. People came and went, and it was very lively.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately bought a map of the space Camp.</p><p>On the map, some of the important places in the area of the star sky Camp were marked.</p><p>there’s indeed a Scripture Hall. Let’s go take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming flew over according to the marks on the map. Soon, Lu Ming saw a magnificent palace.</p><p>Above the door, there were three large words-Sutra library!</p><p>There was a white-haired old man standing guard at the gate.</p><p>you can stay on the first floor and read freely. You can only buy anything on the second floor and above!</p><p>The old man said indifferently.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and walked in.</p><p>The first floor was extremely spacious, and with a single glance, it was filled with books and ancient records.</p><p>Lu Ming flipped through the books casually and realized that the books on the first floor were not secret manuals of divine techniques or divine skills. Instead, they were some miscellaneous books.</p><p>For example, there were books that recorded all sorts of desolate beasts, all sorts of strange stories, introductions to the customs and practices of different star fields, as well as the history of the Great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>No wonder he could flip through it so casually.</p><p>Lu Ming swept a glance over.</p><p>“Godly power biography!”</p><p>Suddenly, a book caught Lu Ming’s attention.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming started to flip through the book. The first section introduced the basic knowledge of divine power. Lu Ming knew everything and skipped through it.</p><p>After that, he began to introduce the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Most of them were similar to what Wu Ming and Wu Yue had said.</p><p>However, it was more detailed here.</p><p>As one’s comprehension and application of divine-grade divine power deepened, one could awaken the origin divine power factor when they reached a certain level.</p><p>However, before awakening the origin divine power factor, there was a process called the degree of awakening.</p><p>For example, Leng Ying and the others who lived on the mountainside of Star Peak had entered this stage and were not far from awakening. Of course, there was still a gap between this stage and awakening.</p><p>Some people’s degree of awakening was 10%, while some people’s degree of awakening was 20% …</p><p>Only when the degree of awakening reached 100% could the origin divine power factor be considered to be truly awakened.</p><p>The higher the degree of awakening, the more powerful the divine power would be.</p><p>I wonder what frigid Eagle’s awakening level is. According to this record, it should be below 50%!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered, but he thought of himself.</p><p>He probably hasn’t even awakened ten percent of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>As for the inextinguishable sword force, it was even worse.</p><p>“It seems that I have to spend more time on Shen power in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and continued to read. The more he read, the more he sighed.</p><p>It turned out that after he had awakened the original divine power, it was just the beginning. He had just awakened the seed. He was still far from the divine power that the primitive gods in the incipient God Realm had.</p><p>The origin divine power factor that had just been awakened was only at the first stage.</p><p>In the future, he could still awaken for the second time, and the third time …</p><p>After the second awakening, he would reach the second tier of the divine power factor. After the third awakening, he would reach the third tier of the divine power factor …</p><p>Every awakening was extremely difficult, one in a million.</p><p>After each awakening, the divine power would transform and become stronger.</p><p>It could even give birth to origin secret skills.</p><p>Every time it was awakened, the origin secret skill that was born might be different. It might be more powerful than ordinary secret skills and mysterious.</p><p>No one knew how many times the divine power factor could be awakened.</p><p>Legend had it that the highest number of times a person could awaken was nine. By then, the divine power had already transformed into a terrifying power. It was definitely equivalent to the true origin divine power and had boundless power.</p><p>Anyone who could do that was a true peak existence in the primeval universe, a figure who dominated the universe.</p><p>“A Shen power actually has so many mysteries. It has endless potential!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
