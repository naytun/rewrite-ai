Its power was truly terrifying.</p><p>I didn’t want to kill you, but you forced me to use this move. I can’t even control myself. Go in peace …</p><p>Jin Xing’s eyes were cold as he thought of something.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The golden light pounced at Lu Ming’s face. Lu Ming retreated quickly, but the speed of the golden light was extremely fast and it was in close pursuit of him.</p><p>“What will happen?”</p><p>The surrounding spectators ‘hearts were in their throats.</p><p>Jin Xing’s move was too terrifying. He broke Lu Ming’s attack with one move and forced Lu Ming to retreat.</p><p>Would Lu Ming be defeated or even die by this move?</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to be cut by the golden light, a loud roar reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body expanded rapidly, and a hundred-meter-tall giant appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming used his ancient God Body, but he didn’t use his full strength. He only used the orange-armored ancient God, turning into a one-hundred-meter tall orange-armored ancient God.</p><p>The long spear in his hand slashed out, and a crescent-shaped spear light slashed forward, clashing with the golden light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two rays of light collided, creating a deafening boom.</p><p>The eye-piercing radiance was so dazzling that one could not open their eyes.</p><p>The two rays of light trembled continuously. Then, the golden light trembled even more violently before it exploded with a bang.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure retreated. It was Jin Xing.</p><p>Jin Xing retreated a few thousand meters and spat out a mouthful of blood. His eyes were full of disbelief.</p><p>His most powerful move had actually been broken, and he himself had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>the ancient God Body! He has also cultivated the ancient God Body!</p><p>The paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion all exclaimed.</p><p>As for the people of the Qin heaven Starfield, they were ecstatic.</p><p>Jin Xing, what other unique skills do you have? use them all. Otherwise, it won’t be enough!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and waved his long spear. Another crescent-shaped spear radiance swept toward Jin Xing.</p><p>“Void severing hand!”</p><p>Jin Xing shouted loudly and continuously struck out with his palms in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming transformed into an ancient God Body, his combat strength was increased by four times. His combat strength was already above Jin Xing’S. He could not resist him at all.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Jin Xing’s body shook violently. With every collision, he was forced to retreat a hundred meters.</p><p>Soon, he was at the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He held the spear with both hands and struck down with all his might. The huge spear radiance was like a mountain range, pressing down on Jin Xing.</p><p>Jin Xing roared and tried his best to resist.</p><p>However, even though he was unwilling, he couldn’t change the fact. When the spear radiance pressed down, he spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying out of the battle stage.</p><p>Jin Xing was defeated!</p><p>At first, there was silence, but then there was a burst of enthusiastic cheers.</p><p>“We won, we won!”</p><p>Lu Ming actually defeated Jin Xing. It’s too shocking!</p><p>“There’s hope, there’s hope!”</p><p>Many people shouted. Their eyes were filled with anticipation and excitement.</p><p>Previously, many people had ignored Lu Ming and did not pay attention to him at all. Most of them had placed their hopes on ice fairy, red flame magic pine, sword Dao limitless, mo jiuye, and grayflame Army destroyer.</p><p>When they saw ice fairy and red flame demonic pine being defeated one after another, they were in despair, thinking that there was no suspense in this competition.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would suddenly appear and actually defeat Jin Xing.</p><p>One must know that Jin Xing had defeated the ice immortal and the red flame demon pine at the same time.</p><p>In this way, they saw hope again.</p><p>Perhaps, Lu Ming could create miracles and continue to win?</p><p>Perhaps Jin Xing was the strongest person in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and the others ‘eyes turned grave.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming hadn’t used his full strength. At least, Lu Ming’s ancient God Body was far more powerful than that of an orange-armored ancient God.</p><p>He had not even used his full strength, yet he already had such battle prowess. They were already far behind.</p><p>“I told you to attack together, but you didn’t listen. Now, who wants to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on the four remaining people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>There were still four youths left in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. At this moment, three of them had gloomy expressions.</p><p>These three people’s cultivation were all seventh level celestial deity.</p><p>However, although their cultivation base was higher than Jin Xing’s, their combat strength was not.</p><p>Jin Xing was a famous heaven’s favorite of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Even when facing a genius, he could fight above his level. They didn’t have this ability.</p><p>If Jin Xing was no match for him, neither were they.</p><p>Their gazes turned to the last ordinary-looking young man.</p><p>Among the four of them, only this person’s expression could be considered calm.</p><p>“I’ll fight this battle!”</p><p>An ordinary-looking young man with a saber in his arms stepped forward, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>His Shen power was extremely strong.</p><p>“Eighth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>“What? Eighth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Many people in the Qin heaven Starfield exclaimed in shock.</p><p>This ordinary-looking young man with a battle saber in his arms had actually reached the eighth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>In the younger generation, to have such a cultivation, it was absolutely shocking.</p><p>One had to know that ice fairy and Scarlet Flame demonic pine had also just broken through to the seventh level celestial deity not long ago.</p><p>“We’re in trouble!”</p><p>Many people were secretly worried for Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Jin Xing was strong, he was only at the sixth level heavenly deity. No matter how strong he was, he was probably not a match for an eighth level heavenly deity at the Divine Child’s level.</p><p>Could Lu Ming be defeated?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ordinary-looking young man walked step by step in the void. The saber in his arms trembled slightly, and then a saber radiance broke through the void and shot into the clouds.</p><p>He was a saber user, an existence on par with sword cultivators. He was famous for his offensive power.</p><p>“Eighth level heavenly deity?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Ever since this person revealed his cultivation, Lu Ming finally had an idea.</p><p>This was because from the expressions of the four remaining people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, Lu Ming could tell that this swordsman should be the strongest.</p><p>As long as an eighth-level celestial deity was not as abnormal as Jin Xing, Lu Ming was confident.</p><p>“I’m Wei Dao, I’ll be your opponent!”</p><p>The ordinary-looking young man said.</p><p>wait a minute, one by one. It’s too much of a waste of time. The few of you should come at me together. I’ll take care of you all at once!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly, his gaze fixed on the remaining three people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“I alone am enough!”</p><p>Wei Dao said coldly.</p><p>“No, no, you can’t do it alone!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>Many people were speechless.</p><p>What was Lu Ming doing? Could it be that after defeating Jin Xing, his self-confidence had exploded?</p><p>Or was Lu Ming still preserving his strength?</p><p>Many people’s imagination ran wild.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
