The winner would obtain the right to use the spirit fluid Lake.</p><p>This time, it was time for the two sides to compete again.</p><p>When Yan Zhi saw Lu Ming’s amazing combat strength, he wanted to ask for Lu Ming’s help. That was why he stopped the city Lord of general Demon City.</p><p>Not long after, a huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>The city gates were tightly shut, and there were already many people standing on top of the city gates.</p><p>Standing on the city gate was the city Lord of ape Demon City and the Son of the city Lord, Yan Zhi’s sworn enemy.</p><p>“Yuan Shan, we’ve already arrived. Where are the people you’re going to fight?”</p><p>Yan Zhi shouted as he stared at one of the burly young men.</p><p>The young man’s arms were extremely long, reaching his knees. He was extremely burly. He was Yuan Shan, the young city Lord of the ape Demon City.</p><p>“You’re really anxious. Since you’re in a hurry to be defeated, then I’ll naturally fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Yuan Shan chuckled and then stepped out.</p><p>Two other young men followed Yuan Shan out.</p><p>A man and a woman.</p><p>The man was ordinary, but the woman was quite beautiful. There was a colorful poisonous snake twining around her arm.</p><p>Yan Zhi’s eyes fell on the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm. His pupils slightly narrowed and he said, ” “I’ve never seen this beautiful lady before. Yuan Shan, could she be a helper you’ve invited from the outside?”</p><p>“On your side, don’t you also have someone I haven’t met before? you must have also been invited from the outside!”</p><p>Yuan Shan’s gaze was fixed on Lu Ming, his eyes glimmering.</p><p>Yan Zhi’s face darkened as he looked at the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm. He was a little shocked.</p><p>Naturally, they knew the background of the heaven’s pride experts of their Magic City mountain. However, once they met a heaven’s pride expert that was invited from the outside, they had no confidence.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s combat strength was strong, he was only a third-level celestial deity after all. He could not quite figure out the cultivation of the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>“Come on, Yan Zhi. Make your move and send you away as soon as possible. I still have to go back and drink with lady Lian.”</p><p>Yuan Shan said loudly. Towards the end of his sentence, he looked at the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm, and a fiery light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“We might not be the ones to lose. Liu Han, you go first!”</p><p>Yan Zhi ordered.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The young man beside Yan Zhi walked out.</p><p>“You go and deal with him!”</p><p>Yuan Shan pointed to a young man beside him.</p><p>The young man stepped forward and stood opposite Liu Han.</p><p>“The same old rules. The one who wins in the end is the winner!”</p><p>Yuan Shan said.</p><p>Yan Zhi nodded.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two young men in the arena were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>fourth level celestial deity, control of sacred grade divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised that the young man, who was selected from the two satellite cities at the foot of Mount Magic City, had such a cultivation level.</p><p>Such a character, when placed in the Qin heaven Starfield, could already be considered a Saint child level character.</p><p>it is said that the Qin heaven star system is At the Edge of the Great Void Holy dynasty. The cultivation level is very low, and even the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor is too lazy to care about it. It seems like it makes sense!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Even though the chutian Starfield was close to the Qin heaven Starfield, its cultivation level was far above the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had sent an Army to guard this place, as well as people to manage it.</p><p>Be it the cultivation environment or the level of cultivation, the chutian Starfield was far superior to the Qin heaven Starfield. Naturally, there were more geniuses born there.</p><p>The two of them had the same cultivation and combat strength. After exchanging hundreds of moves, they both suffered heavy injuries and retreated.</p><p>The first round was a draw!</p><p>“Yan Zhi, it’s our turn!”</p><p>Yuan Shan took a step forward, causing the air to rumble.</p><p>“This time, I will definitely defeat you!”</p><p>Yan Zhi’s eyes flickered with a ferocious light.</p><p>He had been fighting with Yuan Shan since young, but every time, he was always a little weaker. This was a sore point in his heart.</p><p>“Defeat me? Hahaha, Yan Zhi, let me tell you, you will never be my match in your entire life!”</p><p>Yuan Shan laughed and waved his long arm. His huge fist punched towards Yan Zhi, and a muffled explosion sounded in the air.</p><p>Yan Zhi waved his palm to meet it.</p><p>The two of them knew each other’s moves very well, so at the beginning, the two were evenly matched.</p><p>The two of their cultivation were both fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>“Ape King transformation!”</p><p>After fighting for a while, Yuan Shan let out an angry roar. His body swelled up, and fine hair grew on his skin. He had turned into a giant ape that was fifty meters tall.</p><p>“You actually managed to cultivate the ape King transformation!”</p><p>Yan Zhi roared in shock.</p><p>“Haha, I told you, you’ll never be my match!”</p><p>Yuan Shan laughed out loud and stomped on the ground. With every step he took, the ground cracked and shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yuan Shan’s fist, which was like a small hill, smashed towards Yan Zhi.</p><p>Yan Zhi roared. His entire body was filled with divine power that was as dark as ink. It turned into several demonic blades and slashed towards Yuan Shan.</p><p>However, when Yuan Shan’s fist landed on the demonic blade, the demonic blade trembled violently and exploded.</p><p>“Defeat, defeat!”</p><p>Yuan Shan continued to roar and continuously swung his fists. Yan Zhi was also going all out. His demonic blade madly slashed and in an instant, he had slashed out hundreds of blades.</p><p>However, in the end, Yan Zhi was no match for Yuan Shan. His demonic blade continued to shatter and explode, unable to block Yuan Shan’s attack at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, Yuan Shan’s fist landed on Yan Zhi’s body. Yan Zhi cried out in pain and his body flew out like a cannonball. He fell heavily on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Yan Zhi, I told you, you’re not my match!”</p><p>Yuan Shan laughed out loud, extremely arrogant.</p><p>Yan Zhi’s expression was extremely ugly. This time, he had lost even more decisively than before. The gap between him and Yuan Shan had widened again.</p><p>Now, they could only depend on Lu Ming’s performance.</p><p>kid, come on. Let me see the strength of an outsider!</p><p>Yuan Shan’s gaze was directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>make your move. Once I make my move, you won’t have the chance to make your move!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Although Yuan Shan’s strength wasn’t bad, he didn’t take him seriously.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>Yuan Shan roared in rage. He stomped his feet and his body was like a small mountain as he pounced towards Lu Ming. His huge fists were thrown out in succession and the violent fist force was pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Although Yuan Shan said that Lu Ming was arrogant, he went all out when he made his move.</p><p>He didn’t dare to be careless when facing foreign heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. His figure flickered a few times and he dodged Yuan Shan’s attack.</p><p>However, Yuan Shan’s movement was also extremely fast. He twisted his body and charged towards Lu Ming again.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged again.</p><p>“If you have the ability, don’t run. Fight me head on!”</p><p>Yuan Shan roared.</p><p>I’m giving you a chance to use it. Once I make a move, you’ll have no chance. Since you’re so anxious, I’ll fulfill your wish!</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
