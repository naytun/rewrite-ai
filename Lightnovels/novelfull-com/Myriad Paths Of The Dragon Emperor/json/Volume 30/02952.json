He found a place to stay and asked around for information.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming did not have any clues after a few days. This made him anxious.</p><p>The longer time passed, the more dangerous it would be for Qiu Yue and the rest. Lu Ming could not wait to kill his way to the residence of the city Lord of Magic City.</p><p>However, there were many experts in the city Lord’s mansion of demonic city. There were probably many existences close to the divine King realm. Moreover, there was also the night Devil King, a true Divine King.</p><p>The difference between a celestial God and a Divine King was huge. Given Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, he would most likely die if he encountered a Divine King.</p><p>This matter could only be considered at length.</p><p>However, a few days later, Lu Ming heard a piece of news that made his eyes light up.</p><p>Not long after, the great demonic City War would be held in demonic city.</p><p>This was the second time that Lu Ming had heard the term ‘great battle of Magic City’. The first time he heard it was when Yan Zhi asked him when he met him. At that time, Lu Ming did not pay much attention to it and did not understand it in detail.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had a detailed understanding of it.</p><p>The great battle of demonic city was a competition between the younger generation of demonic city mountain, and it was personally organized by the night Demon King.</p><p>In the past, it was a method for the night Demon Lord to select talents.</p><p>However, this time’s demonic City War was different.</p><p>This time, it was because the night Demon King had a daughter who had unparalleled talent. She was young, but her battle-power was shockingly high. Moreover, she was also a country-toppling beauty.</p><p>Therefore, this time, the night Demon King spread the news that the demonic City War would be open to the public.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from outside of Magic City mountain can also participate.</p><p>As long as they were in the top ten, they would be rewarded with 500 grams of demon night spring.</p><p>This was a great temptation.</p><p>This was because the demon night spring had a great nourishing effect on a cultivator’s soul. Long-term use would make the soul stronger and more condensed. The spiritual consciousness would also become stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, the production of the demon night spring was very little. On average, it could only produce one Jin every hundred years. The supply was in short supply.</p><p>Getting into the top ten and being rewarded with a Jin of demon night spring was a great temptation.</p><p>Not only were the heaven’s favorites from Magic City mountain rubbing their hands in anticipation, even the heaven’s favorites from outside magic City mountain rushed over after hearing the news.</p><p>“No wonder I met that woman!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He thought of the woman with a snake wrapped around her arm whom the ape Demon City had invited. It was very likely that she had come for the great battle in demonic city.</p><p>In addition, the top ten heaven’s favorites can join demonic city at any time if they want to and become the demonic Lord of demonic city. Their status will be second only to the night Demon King, only below one and above hundreds of millions of people.</p><p>&Nbsp; in addition, whoever defeated the night Demon king’s daughter and won first place would not only get five kilograms of demon night spring, but also the chance to date the night Demon king’s daughter.</p><p>the Demon King is trying to expand his power!</p><p>Some people discussed in private.</p><p>Recruiting foreign heaven’s favorites and granting them the title of Demon Lord. He even chose the top heaven’s favorites to be friends with his daughter. He was obviously trying to expand his power and increase the strength of demon Capital Mountain.</p><p>“First place, I want it!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He wasn’t interested in the five kilograms of mo yequan, nor was he interested in the beauty of the night Demon king’s daughter. He just wanted a chance to get close to the night Demon king’s daughter.</p><p>As long as he could get close to the night Demon Lord’s daughter, he would have the chance to find out where Qiu Yue and the others were being held.</p><p>Therefore, he had to get first place in the great battle of demonic city.</p><p>The great battle of demonic city was in half a month’s time.</p><p>In the following time, Magic City became lively.</p><p>Because of this opening, many foreign heaven’s favorites could enter the demonic city without a token as long as they showed enough strength.</p><p>Therefore, during this period of time, some young figures could be seen on the streets of Magic City from time to time. There were men and women, and they had dignified appearances. At first glance, one could tell that they were extraordinary.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp cry was heard.</p><p>Lu Ming looked for the source of the voice and frowned.</p><p>He saw a familiar face. It was the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>Enemies really meet on a narrow road.</p><p>Beside the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm, there was a young man.</p><p>This person was tall and sturdy, and his hair was tied into many tiny braids. The most striking thing was that there was a snake wrapped around each of his arms.</p><p>One of them was as red as blood, while the other was as white as snow. The two huge snakes flicked their tongues and stared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“Junior Sister, is this the brat who killed your Xiao Lu?”</p><p>The young man with a ponytail asked loudly. He looked at Lu Ming with a ferocious gaze.</p><p>“Yes, senior brother, it’s him. I want him to pay with his life!”</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm glared at Lu Ming with a deep-rooted hatred in her eyes.</p><p>“He’s dead!”</p><p>The man with the plaited hair grinned hideously and strode toward Lu Ming. A powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Kid, the one who killed you is using wizard blood!”</p><p>The witch’s blood shouted and pressed his palm down on Lu Ming.</p><p>His palm enlarged rapidly and his five fingers seemed to have transformed into five giant pythons, blasting towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The powerful pressure spread in all directions, forcing many people to retreat.</p><p>“Eighth level celestial deity, divine-grade divine power!”</p><p>The moment the other party attacked, Lu Ming could sense his strength.</p><p>This kind of strength could be said to be shocking. He was definitely a top genius from the nine Heavens Royal Palace.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming activated the fourfold combat power of the battle formula. The ten types of divine powers in his body roared wildly and he threw a punch.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws. It pounced at the other party and collided with his palm.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>break! the witch’s blood shouted and suddenly exerted force. With a boom, Lu Ming’s nine-clawed Divine Dragon image collapsed. His body trembled and he retreated continuously. He only managed to stabilize himself after retreating more than a dozen steps.</p><p>An eighth level heavenly deity Divine Son character was truly too powerful.</p><p>For example, when the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the Qin heaven star region’s geniuses were competing, the other party’s next opponent was a Divine Son level eighth-level heavenly deity. Although Lu Ming had defeated the other party, that was after he had transformed into the ancient God Body. He had not transformed into the ancient God Body. Lu Ming was still not the other party’s match.</p><p>Therefore, it was normal for him to be forced back by the witch’s blood.</p><p>“To be able to take one of my moves and not die, you have some ability. However, you still can’t escape death!”</p><p>Wu Xue laughed hideously, and his killing intent grew stronger. He was about to launch another attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud roar was heard. Then, a group of armored figures flew over and surrounded them from all directions.</p><p>“The two of you, fighting and killing are not allowed in the Magic City. Please give me some face. If you have any grudges, you can fight after we leave the Magic City!”</p><p>One of the burly men stepped forward and cupped his fists at Lu Ming and Wu Xue.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Wu Xue snorted coldly and retracted his aura.</p><p>In demonic city, he had no choice but to give face to the night Demon King.</p><p>Moreover, he had another purpose for coming here. It was not wise to alert the enemy now.</p><p>“Since the Shanghai guards have spoken, I’ll let this brat off for the time being!”</p><p>Wu Xue said with a cold smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
