An incomparably huge Spear’s gleam soared into the sky like a pillar that held up the sky.</p><p>Star explosion, when cultivated to the highest level, was said to be able to blow up a planet.</p><p>After casting this move, endless divine power in Lu Ming’s body surged towards his hands as if it was free. The divine power in Lu Ming’s body, the divine power of ten divine flames, was sucked dry in an instant.</p><p>This move consumed too much divine power.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had the ‘measure’ formula.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula glowed and a steady stream of divine power poured into Lu Ming’s body. The divine power in Lu Ming’s body became thick again and he was at his peak.</p><p>As soon as this move was used, all evil’s expression changed drastically as he felt a fatal crisis.</p><p>“Quick, quick, gather our strength!”</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Each of the guards emitted a brilliant light. They formed a formation, and it was as if there was an invisible thread connecting them together. Their powers were able to link up with each other.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge beam of divine light was formed and blasted toward Lu Ming, clashing with the ‘star explosion’ move.</p><p>The entire Colosseum was shaking violently. Endless energy bombarded the seats, the stands, and the walls around the Colosseum.</p><p>Even with the protection of the array, the Colosseum was unable to withstand the force. It continued to collapse and explode. In the next moment, the entire Colosseum collapsed and turned into ruins.</p><p>Some of The Fiend slaves and desolate beasts nearby were torn apart by the overflowing energy and died on the spot before they could even scream.</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and held the spear with both hands. Divine energy continuously rushed into the long spear in his hands.</p><p>The radiance of the spear became even more dazzling.</p><p>When the radiance reached a certain level, it exploded.</p><p>The spear radiance exploded with terrifying energy, directly destroying the divine light condensed by the great formation of Shanghai’s defense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Waves of terrifying energy charged towards the formation formed by the Shanghai guards.</p><p>啊啊啊!</p><p>Continuous screams rang out as cracks appeared on the bodies of some of the weaker guards. Then, they were torn to pieces.</p><p>In a short while, at least a few dozen Shanghai guards had died.</p><p>The entire Magic City guards ‘formation had been pushed back thousands of meters.</p><p>“Such power …”</p><p>Wan E was trembling with fear. The power of Lu Ming’s move was truly terrifying. If he were to face this move alone, he would be seriously injured even if he did not die.</p><p>On the other side, the other two demon masters were also extremely shocked when they saw this scene.</p><p>“That brat is evil, I’ll bring people to help evil!”</p><p>One of the demon masters, who looked like an old man, said. He led over a thousand Demon City guards and charged towards the myriad fiend Demon Lord.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>The elder-looking demon master gave the order. Immediately, thousands of demonic city guards formed a new formation. Divine power surged, and a divine light blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s divine energy was abundant. He turned his long spear and launched a terrifying attack. It collided with the divine light and his body was forced to retreat a hundred meters.</p><p>“Kill, kill this brat!”</p><p>All evil roared. At this moment, he no longer wanted to capture Lu Ming alive. He only wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying and it made him tremble with fear.</p><p>The two demon masters and the two great formations of the demonic city’s defense launched a series of attacks on Lu Ming.</p><p>divine power Dharma form, ice chains, nine-layered Crimson Gold armor, three world-ending strikes …</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed continuously. He cast all his divine skills and secret skills to fight against his opponent.</p><p>With the power of the ancient God Body and his terrifying defense, he managed to resist the attack.</p><p>“This brat is only a third level celestial deity. How could he have such terrifying strength? Furthermore, what was going on with his Shen power? Why does it seem like we can’t finish it?”</p><p>All evil, the old-looking demon master, and even many of the demon capital guards were unable to calm down. They were all extremely shocked.</p><p>If it was anyone else, they would have run out of divine power in such a confrontation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was able to maintain each of his moves at its peak and unleash its strongest power.</p><p>“Dragon Cave, ignore The Fiend slaves and kill this brat!”</p><p>Infinite evil roared. Of course, he was shouting at the demon master who looked like a middle-aged man.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The Dragon Cave’s gaze let go of the demonic slaves and led the remaining 1000-plus demonic city guards towards Wan Xie and the others.</p><p>let’s set up a formation together and form a large formation!</p><p>Dragon Cave said.</p><p>In an instant, all evil, Dragon Cave, and the other two demon kings led the 2500 or so Demon City guards, and their figures flickered as they merged together to form an even larger Demon City guard formation.</p><p>This way, the power was even more shocking.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of light, huge and boundless, shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and collided with the light pillar. At that moment, Lu Ming felt a violent force rushing at him. His body trembled and he retreated continuously.</p><p>The power of the formation formed by three great demon kings and two thousand and five hundred demonic city guards was too strong. It had completely surpassed Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill, kill this bastard!”</p><p>At the side, Wan Xing roared loudly, extremely excited.</p><p>He was so jealous of Lu Ming’s talent that he could not wait to kill him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The array was activated again and Lu Ming was forced to retreat.</p><p>At this moment, outside the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>it seems that they’ve already started fighting. Let’s make our move!</p><p>The witch Blood said.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Pei Lin was very direct. He turned into a blade light and charged towards the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! Pei Lin shouted and slashed down. A huge blade light, thousands of miles long, enveloped the entire city Lord’s mansion and was about to split it in half.</p><p>But at this time, a giant stick rose up from the city Lord’s mansion and hit the blade light. The blade light, which was thousands of miles long, was shattered.</p><p>“I knew that you people didn’t have good intentions!”</p><p>A deep voice was heard. Then, a burly figure rushed out of the city Lord’s mansion and stood in the air.</p><p>It was an Apeman who was five meters tall and covered in black hair. He held a black iron rod in his hand and emitted a shocking aura.</p><p>It was the Qi of a half-step Divine King!</p><p>“You’re one of the nine great demon kings!”</p><p>Peilin said coldly.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>The ape said.</p><p>“Just in time. After killing you, I can complete my mission!”</p><p>Pei Lin’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he activated his divine power. He took a step forward and charged towards the Apeman. The terrifying blade light seemed to be able to split the heavens and earth.</p><p>“I’d like to see how strong a genius who can control divine-grade divine power is!”</p><p>The Apeman waved his iron staff and charged at Pei Lin. The two of them fought head-on and exchanged blows continuously. For a while, there was no clear winner.</p><p>However, peilin seemed to be at a disadvantage.</p><p>The half-step Divine King was extremely powerful and his divine power was extremely dense. Although Pei Lin was a Divine Son, he was only an eighth level heavenly God after all.</p><p>However, it would not be easy for the other party to win.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Wu Xue, su mu, and the others all rushed out and attacked the city master’s mansion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
