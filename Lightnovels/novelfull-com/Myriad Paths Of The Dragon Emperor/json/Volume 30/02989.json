Very soon, they found Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>“Brother Lu, lady Qiuyue, why are you here?”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue smiled.</p><p>After not seeing each other for over a decade, Wu Ming and Wu Yue’s cultivation had become much more exquisite. They were not far from ninth level celestial deity either.</p><p>“Brother Wu, I’d like to ask you something. What’s the matter with star-moon ancient city?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>so it’s because of star-moon ancient city. We don’t know much about the details. We only know that star-moon ancient city is an ancient ruin. Legend has it that it was left behind from the beginning of the heavenly Palace era. It contains all kinds of opportunities. It’s said that every time someone goes there, they will gain something!</p><p>“There are even people who have successfully awakened the origin divine power factor inside!”</p><p>Wu Ming explained. As he said this, his eyes revealed a fiery radiance.</p><p>the ruins left behind during the early days of the heavenly Palace era!</p><p>Lu Ming was also secretly shocked.</p><p>Now, it was the later stage of the heavenly Palace era, which was many years away from the beginning.</p><p>I heard that there are all kinds of forbidden grounds inside that contain treasures …</p><p>Wuyue added.</p><p>“Oh, did anyone find a treasure of the cold attribute inside?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>yes. I heard that there’s a forbidden area inside that has Supreme cold treasures!</p><p>Wuyue said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>If he could obtain a cold-attribute treasure in star-moon ancient city, it would greatly increase his cultivation speed.</p><p>He had to go to star-moon ancient city.</p><p>It was too slow to cultivate step by step. He could only improve faster by taking risks and experiencing.</p><p>After chatting with Wu Ming and Wu Yue, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue returned to their residence.</p><p>Ten days passed by in a flash.</p><p>Ten days later, the square at the foot of the mountain was packed with people.</p><p>Most of the elites from the universal camp were here.</p><p>Of course, there was a limit to entering star-moon ancient city. Those above the divine King realm couldn’t enter. Only the half-step Divine King realm could enter.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue walked toward Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. There were a few young men and women following behind them. All of them had extraordinary auras.</p><p>Wu Ming introduced the few young men and women. They were all the Wu clan’s prodigies. They cultivated on Star Peak, and their cultivation bases were below the God King stage.</p><p>The few of them greeted each other and could be considered to have gotten to know each other.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone spoke and looked in the direction of Star Peak.</p><p>A beam of light flew over from the top of the star Peak.</p><p>It was a white-haired old man who stood in the air above the square. A vast and unfathomable aura emanated from his body, making it difficult to guess what his cultivation was.</p><p>“My name is Bai Li. You can call me elder Bai!”</p><p>The white-haired elder said.</p><p>“Greetings, elder Bai!”</p><p>Many people saluted.</p><p>The experts in charge of the universal camp were all sent by the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They were the direct descendants of the nine absolute Heavenly King and did not belong to any aristocratic family.</p><p>you all want to enter star-moon ancient city, right? first of all, I want to remind you that it’s very dangerous to go to star-moon ancient city. You can lose your life at any time. You’d better think about it carefully!</p><p>Bai Li warned seriously.</p><p>However, no one made a sound.</p><p>Of course, there would be danger in taking risks and searching for opportunities.</p><p>If he didn’t dare to go just because there was danger, then what was the point of cultivating? he would definitely be pulled further and further away from the other heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Bai Li was expressionless as he continued. also, the most important thing is that it’s not only the heaven’s favorites from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion who will enter star-moon ancient city. There are also other heaven’s favorites from other Heavenly King mansions. A total of four Heavenly King mansions have the path to star-moon ancient city. They will also enter!</p><p>Hearing this, many of the new members were shocked.</p><p>On the other hand, the older members were not surprised, as they had already known about it.</p><p>“The other members of the Heavenly King Manor will also enter!”</p><p>Many people murmured as their gazes turned serious.</p><p>The great void Holy dynasty was divided into territories. There were a total of 27 Heavenly Kings who guarded the territories.</p><p>Each Heavenly King mansion was like a country within a country, managing a large area of territory.</p><p>However, these Heavenly Kings ‘residences did not live in harmony. Instead, they competed with each other and even attacked each other, just like two different countries.</p><p>Some of the Heavenly King manors even had irreconcilable enmity between them, and they would kill each other as soon as they met.</p><p>Therefore, if the other heaven’s favorites from the Heavenly King Palace entered star-moon ancient city, the danger would increase greatly.</p><p>alright, that’s all I have to say. Is there anyone else who wants to withdraw? it’s not too late to withdraw now!</p><p>Bai Li said.</p><p>No one backed out.</p><p>alright, since no one is backing out, then follow me. I’ll allow you to fly!</p><p>Bai Li said before flying out of the universal camp.</p><p>Everyone rose into the air and followed Bai Li.</p><p>After flying for half an hour, they came to a hidden place.</p><p>The space here was very strange. It seemed to be shrinking in one direction, and there was a dark hole in that direction.</p><p>“Then … Could it be a wormhole?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lu Ming had read about wormholes in some ancient books.</p><p>Wormholes mostly appeared naturally after the universe was born.</p><p>Wormholes were extremely mysterious. Different wormholes in the universe would connect with each other. After entering a wormhole, one could appear in another place in the universe.</p><p>Perhaps, in an instant, he would be transported from one star region to another.</p><p>Wormholes and teleportation arrays were different.</p><p>The teleportation formation was man-made. The teleportation was actually across the void, just like a void channel, which also required time.</p><p>For example, teleportation across star fields would take a lot of time.</p><p>However, wormholes weren’t needed. In an instant, they could enter other star fields or even further.</p><p>Could it be that he had to pass through this wormhole to enter star-moon ancient city?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bai Li was the first to fly forward and into the wormhole. In a flash, his figure disappeared.</p><p>Then, the old members followed and flew into the wormhole.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>One of the Wu family’s youths said as he flew forward.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest also entered the wormhole.</p><p>As soon as he entered the wormhole, Lu Ming was enveloped by a strange energy. He seemed to see a passage in the void that led to the front.</p><p>Then, in a flash, he disappeared completely. In the next moment, his body felt lighter, and the force disappeared.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he was standing on a piece of land.</p><p>Looking back, there was another wormhole behind them.</p><p>This wormhole was connected to the wormhole in the star sky Camp.</p><p>If they wanted to go back, they could directly enter this wormhole and return to the star sky Camp.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>They were standing on a flat piece of land. In front of them was a majestic ancient city that stood between the sky and the earth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
