Their expressions were still wooden.</p><p>you can actually sense the formation that we have set up and go around it. Impressive. However, you still have to die!</p><p>One of the burly men spoke. Even as he spoke, his expression was still wooden and his voice was cold, as if there was no emotion at all.</p><p>“So, that formation was set up by you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>It seemed that the other party had been waiting for them here for a long time and had set up a big formation here. Fortunately, the “measure” character had sensed an unusual energy fluctuation and thus avoided the big formation. Otherwise, once they walked into the big formation set up by others, it would be more likely to be a disaster.</p><p>Who was the other party?</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Qin wuyou and the rest.</p><p>In the Qin heaven Starfield, Lu Ming had fought against Qin wuyou and the others, suppressing a group of geniuses from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and offending a group of people.</p><p>Those people had a reason to kill Lu Ming, but he didn’t meet Qin wuyou and the others when he came. How did they know that Lu Ming was here?</p><p>There was also Wu Xue and the others he had met on Mount modu.</p><p>Those people had a reason to kill Lu Ming. However, they did not know that he had come to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Could it be that I’m being followed?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart suddenly moved as he thought of this possibility.</p><p>This was the only way for the Wu family to get to the universal camp. If not for the fact that the other party had been paying attention to his whereabouts, how could they possibly have set up a formation here?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind in an instant. However, the other party had already made their move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A saber appeared in the hands of the three dull-looking burly men. Two rays of Saber Light slashed toward Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>Fast, extremely fast, and they all attacked at the same time, without a single mistake. Their cooperation was flawless. This was clearly the result of many years of training.</p><p>“If you want to kill my Woo family’s friends, you’ll have to get past us first!”</p><p>Wu Yue and Wu Ming shouted and attacked as well. The divine skills that the two of them cultivated were extremely special. As soon as they attacked, tens of thousands of horses galloped forward. Hundreds of divine horses stepped on the void, wanting to trample the enemy to death.</p><p>However, as the blade light slashed, the mystical horses were shattered one by one.</p><p>In an instant, the hundreds of mystical horses were all annihilated. Wu Ming and Wu Yue were forced back and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Half-step Divine King, which family are you from?”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue shouted at the same time in shock.</p><p>The two of them were eighth level heavenly gods and the divine energy they controlled was undoubtedly divine grade divine energy. However, the opponent’s cultivation had reached the half-step Divine King realm and he completely suppressed them.</p><p>“Let’s go down and find the answer!”</p><p>The two middle-aged men said coldly. They attacked again and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The other men in long robes surrounded them to prevent Lu Ming and the rest from escaping.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out an ancient God’s roar. His body expanded rapidly and turned into an ancient God Body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The long spear shook and swept out. It swept across the opponent’s blade light and exploded with two loud bangs. The two middle-aged men were directly sent flying.</p><p>his strength is indeed astonishing. Let’s attack together and end this battle quickly!</p><p>A man in a long robe with blood-red edges shouted coldly. His figure flashed and he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The others also made their moves at the same time. One after another, blade lights were dazzling and full of killing intent. This was a killing blade. There were no unnecessary tricks, but it was fast, fierce, and powerful.</p><p>“You guys, stay behind me!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and a stream of divine power enveloped Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue. Then, he shook his long spear and rays of spear radiance burst out.</p><p>Dozens of huge spear shadows filled the void and stabbed in all directions.</p><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard in the sky.</p><p>There were a total of twelve men in blood-red robes. All of them were at the half-step Divine King realm and they were cultivating divine skills that could kill. When they worked together, their strength was terrifying.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s current abilities, it was difficult for him to fight.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of Saber Light passed through Lu Ming’s attack and slashed at his body, producing a sizzling sound and four-colored sparks. A green scale was cut open and blood seeped out.</p><p>The other party’s attack was enough to break through Lu Ming’s defense.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted as he cast the divine Dragon materialization art. The seven nine-clawed divine Dragons charged wildly in one direction. At the same time, Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed in that direction as well.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of collisions broke out. A few people in long robes with blood-red edges were pushed back by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon. Lu Ming took the opportunity to break out of the encirclement.</p><p>After breaking out of the encirclement, he protected Qiu Yue and the rest behind him. Lu Ming had no more reservations.</p><p>if you want to kill me, then you can all stay here today!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with ruthlessness. He had rushed out of the encirclement not to escape but to make a better attack.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>A low growl came from Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, the divine power in Lu Ming’s body surged wildly into the long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A huge spear light burst out from the long spear and stabbed at the 12 men in blood-red robes.</p><p>“Go around it!”</p><p>attack! a man in a blood-red robe shouted coldly. The 12 men in blood-red robes used their strange identities and dodged the attack of the spear light. They then came from both sides of the spear light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>How could he easily get around exploding star?</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear radiance suddenly exploded and turned into countless strong Qi that swept in all directions. Like a stormy sea, it crushed the 12 men in blood-red robes.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of the 12 men changed drastically as they frantically retreated. However, they were still hit by the powerful Qi and coughed up blood. They were all heavily injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to attack.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He could feel a terrifying pressure coming down from the sky. Then, an immense force came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to kill the other party. He waved his spear and swept it towards the sky.</p><p>Only then did he realize that there was also a saber flare slashing toward him from the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber ray slashed at the long spear. In an instant, Lu Ming’s expression changed. The power of this saber ray was terrifyingly strong, as unfathomable as the ocean.</p><p>Lu Ming trembled violently and his body retreated rapidly. The long spear in his hand trembled continuously and he almost lost his grip and flew out.</p><p>“God King!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and looked at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, there was also a man in a long robe with blood-red edges. He looked to be in his sixties. He stepped on the void and descended from the sky.</p><p>This man was a Divine King expert.</p><p>The man in the blood-red robe looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>when I received the news, saying how monstrous a fourth level celestial deity’s combat strength is, I originally didn’t believe it and let them give it a try. I didn’t expect that your strength is even more terrifying than imagined!</p><p>The other party sighed.</p><p>This man in the blood-rimmed robe had more emotions than the other men.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
