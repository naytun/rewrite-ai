Even the sect leader of the immortal sword sect and the Holy Lord of the boundless Holy Land were at most on the same level as him. It was impossible for them to hurt him.</p><p>Only the legendary figures of the red flame clan and the ice Soul Clan could be injured.</p><p>However, a young man riding a Divine Dragon had appeared and injured the Dean of the unique devil Academy.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others were all stunned.</p><p>Where did this Divine Dragon come from? wasn’t it a little too powerful? it was actually able to injure the Dean of the unique demon Academy. It was definitely an Overlord-like creature!</p><p>However, such a powerful existence actually allowed Lu Ming to ride on his head?</p><p>It should be known that the more powerful an existence was, the more arrogant they would be. It was a great humiliation for them to be riding on someone’s head. It was just like an ordinary person stepping on the face of the unique demon Academy’s Dean. It was an incredible thing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I really can’t see through you at all!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang muttered.</p><p>They were not the only ones who thought so. The others thought so too. At this moment, Lu Ming’s figure kept growing in everyone’s eyes. His body seemed to be shrouded in a layer of thick fog, giving off an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>When the Supreme martial artist moved, the eyes of the Supreme martial artist, universe master, and the others nearly popped out of their sockets as they roared in their hearts in disbelief.</p><p>In particular, the Supreme universe was so jealous that he was about to go crazy. He kept roaring in his heart. Why was Lu Ming so lucky? why did all of this not belong to him?</p><p>A mere third level Divine King can only act like a tyrant in the Qin heaven star realm and send you on your way!</p><p>Lu Ming stood on you Long’s head and looked down at the Dean of the unique demon Academy. His voice was filled with disdain.</p><p>The demonic Academy’s Dean, demon Xing, was a third level Godking. Of course, Lu Ming did not know this. It was bone demon who told him.</p><p>Breaking through to the divine King realm was extremely difficult. Each breakthrough required a huge amount of resources, talent, and luck. Otherwise, it would be hard to break through.</p><p>Of course, the difference between each level was also very large.</p><p>Although the gap between ethereal God Realm, true God Realm, and sky god Realm was big, it was far from the king God Realm.</p><p>In the divine King realm, those with a higher cultivation base were superior to others. They could look down on people of the next realm and crush them with their strength.</p><p>In the Qin heaven Starfield, the majority of the godkings were at the first level of the Godking realm.</p><p>A second level Godking was already an expert among the godkings.</p><p>For example, the Kong Xuan sect’s Yue Wu Ya was at the second level of the God King realm.</p><p>There were also some top experts from the three Overlord forces who were at the second level of the king God Realm.</p><p>In addition, the sect Masters of the ten great sects were also at the second level of the Godking realm. Of course, the Dragon Boat Mountain was an exception.</p><p>As for the Dragon Boat Mountain, the head of the unique demon Academy, the sect master of the undying sword sect, and the immeasurable Saint son and the divine Lord, they were all third level Godking realm existences.</p><p>Yue Wu Ya, who was at the second level of the Godking realm, was almost crushed by the unique demon Academy’s Dean. From this, one could see the difference between them.</p><p>The third level of the Godking realm was the pinnacle of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>However, it was said that the red flame clan and the ice Soul Clan had terrifying experts at the fourth level of the king God Realm. However, such experts were extremely rare and were usually in seclusion.</p><p>After you Long’s voice rang out, his Dragon Claw stepped on the air and continued to charge toward the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief shouted angrily. He used all his strength to fight against you long, but he was still no match for him. After a few moves, he retreated again, and his body was almost torn apart by you Long’s dragon claws. Even so, there was still a wound on his body, and blood was flowing.</p><p>“Who are you? Who the hell are you? You definitely aren’t from the Qin heaven Starfield. Which Starfield do you come from?”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief roared.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to know who I am. Kill!”</p><p>You long let out a roar and continued to charge toward the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>attack! Attack together! Do you two want to see us being defeated by him one by one? ”</p><p>The Dean of the unique demon Academy roared. He was speaking to the Godking experts of the unique demon Academy, but the last two sentences were directed at the sect master of the immortal sword sect and the boundless Holy Land’s Saint Lord.</p><p>He knew that he was no match for you long by himself.</p><p>In the next moment, the Godking of the unique devil Academy made his move. All sorts of terrifying attacks, together with the demon Punisher, were launched toward you long.</p><p>At the same time, the sect leader of the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land’s Saint Lord also attacked you long.</p><p>With so many experts joining hands, the power was simply enough to destroy the world.</p><p>good, good, a bunch of ants. Today, I’ll let you know my power!</p><p>Dark Dragon, also known as bone demon, roared.</p><p>Dark light shone from you Long’s body as he twisted his body and pounced at the experts.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The dark Dragon’s dragon claws continued to step out. Each claw was so huge that it could destroy hundreds of mountains.</p><p>At the same time, you Long’s Dragon Horn shone with a light that was sharper than a Divine Blade.</p><p>You long attacked with all his might, completely disregarding his own defense.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Demon Xing, the sect master of the indestructible sword sect, and the others cheered. Terrifying attacks landed on you Long’s body, wanting to destroy him.</p><p>However, the moment the attack landed, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>That was because when their attacks landed on you Long’s body, it was as if their attacks had landed on a sturdy divine weapon. It was impossible to even leave a mark on the Dragon’s scales, let alone break through your defense.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>They widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Then, their hearts started to beat wildly because you Long’s attack had already arrived. They could only defend with all their strength.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a series of explosions, the experts of the three Overlord forces were sent flying like cannonballs. Some of the weaker ones even spat out blood.</p><p>In the first clash, you long had the upper hand.</p><p>Everyone else present was stunned. They simply couldn’t believe their eyes.</p><p>Facing so many experts, you long could actually still have the upper hand.</p><p>Of course, they didn’t know that you long was an existence that had surpassed godkings. His body was unimaginably tough, and his defense was even more astonishing. Even if he didn’t counterattack, a mere third level Godking wouldn’t be able to break through his defense.</p><p>Not to mention the second and first level godkings.</p><p>If not for you Long’s severe injuries and his current strength, which was not even one-ten-thousandth of his original strength, he would have been able to kill the Dean of the unique demon Academy and the others with a single breath.</p><p>This wasn’t an exaggeration. If you long was at his peak, he could really kill the Dean of the unique demon Academy and the others with a single breath.</p><p>The gap between each level of the divine King realm was huge.</p><p>A fourth level Godking was already capable of crushing a third level Godking, let alone existences that had surpassed Godking.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Dark Dragon roared and continued to attack the three Overlord experts.</p><p>This time, you long did not attack the strongest people like the Dean of the unique demon Academy and the sect master of the immortal sword sect.</p><p>In you Long’s current state, he could suppress a third firmament Divine King, but it would be difficult to kill him.</p><p>Thus, you long charged toward those first level Divine King realm experts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
