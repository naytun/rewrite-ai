BOOM!</p><p>When Qin wuyou’s seven injuries fist force came crashing down, the nine layers of ice shields were shattered one after another.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist force hit Bing Hu’s body, causing him to scream in pain. His body fell heavily on the fighting stage. Many of his bones were broken, and his body was like a pool of mud, lying on the ground with blood flowing out.</p><p>However, he was not dead yet!</p><p>However, Qin wuyou didn’t stop. He looked down from above and formed a long spear in his hand, throwing it at the frozen lake.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through Bing Hu’s forehead. This time, Bing Hu had completely fallen.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The ice deity roared in anger and glared at Qin wuyou. “He was already defeated just now. Why did you still want to kill him?”</p><p>“In my hands, defeat means death!”</p><p>Qin wuyou said coldly.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Ice immortal was furious.</p><p>“What a good” defeat means death.”I’ll slaughter you!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun roared and rushed up the fighting stage, his body emitting a hot aura.</p><p>“You should’ve attacked long ago. You called a piece of trash to come up and die. Do you really think you can consume my divine power? You’re really delusional!”</p><p>Qin wuyou sneered.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun roared in anger. His body was covered in flames as he charged towards Qin wuyou.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>Qin wuyou used the seven divine injury fist to fight with the ash-gray flame Army destroyer.</p><p>The two of them had fought last time, but there was no clear winner. This time, the battle was even more intense.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Both of their attacks were domineering. They met force with force, and their fist forces constantly collided. In an instant, they had punched each other hundreds of times.</p><p>“King Kong of Fury!”</p><p>Suddenly, cangyan pojun shouted and the flames on his body became even more intense. The endless flames condensed into a giant that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p>This one was huge and held a flaming mace in his hand.</p><p>raging Vajra! Cangyan po Jun actually managed to cultivate the raging Vajra!</p><p>cangyan po Jun’s talent is truly amazing. He has even successfully cultivated such a secret skill. His combat strength is no weaker than mo jiuye and boundless sword Dao!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>In the past, when mo jiuye and boundless sword Dao had cultivated an ancient God Body, many people thought that cangyan po Jun’s strength would be surpassed.</p><p>However, now that they had seen cangyan po Jun cultivate the raging King Kong, they knew that he was not weak at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! cangyan po Jun roared in anger. The king Kong of wrath waved his Mace and smashed it towards Qin wuyou.</p><p>Qin wuyou’s eyes turned serious as he faced the raging Vajra.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Qin wuyou’s face suddenly turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The blood gathered on his fists, making his fist force even more powerful.</p><p>The more injured he was, the more powerful the seven injury divine fist was.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Qin wuyou wasn’t afraid at all. He rushed toward the king of wrath and continuously struck out with the seven divine injures fist, engaging in an intense battle with the grayflame Army destroyer.</p><p>The battle between the two had entered a state of white heat, and they both used their ultimate moves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The king Kong of Fury had astonishing power and the temperature of its flames was even more terrifying. During the confrontation, it actually suppressed Qin wuyou and gained a slight upper hand.</p><p>“Cangyan pojun is going to win!”</p><p>The people of the Qin heaven Starfield were overjoyed.</p><p>In the battle between the divine sons, they were finally not as passive as the Holy Sons, who could not withstand a single blow.</p><p>this secret technique is somewhat similar to the divine Dragon materialization art!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>He felt that cangyan po Jun’s King Kong of Fury was similar to the divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>However, he wasn’t that optimistic. He was certain that cangyan po Jun would win.</p><p>Sure enough, from the start, the ashen Flames of Destruction had the upper hand. He suppressed Qin Wushang and even injured him.</p><p>However, after Qin Wushang was injured, the power of the seven divine injures fist became stronger. Gradually, it was even with the fire of destruction.</p><p>One had to admit that a secret skill like the seven divine injuries fist was truly abnormal.</p><p>The more injured he was, the more powerful he would be. This was extremely advantageous in battle.</p><p>For example, when others were injured in a great battle, their strength would become weaker and weaker, but you would become stronger and stronger. How terrifying was that?</p><p>So, from the start, cangyan po Jun had the upper hand, but later on, the two of them ended up in a draw.</p><p>However, it would also be very difficult for Qin wuyou to defeat cangyan pojun.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Cang Yan Army destroyer’s battle intent soared. His three-meter-tall body was filled with shocking flames, and the space was distorted by the heat.</p><p>His body was covered in a layer of armor with runes flowing on it. He looked like an invincible god of fire.</p><p>The two of them exchanged another hundred moves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, Qin wuyou’s seven injuries fist landed on the body of cangyan po Jun, sending him flying. However, the raging King Kong controlled the huge Wolf-tooth club and smashed it onto Qin wuyou’s body.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Qin wuyou coughed up a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying out of the fighting ring like a cannonball.</p><p>Qin wuyou and cangyan pojun flew out of the fighting ring almost at the same time. Then, they took out healing divine pills at the same time and started to heal their injuries.</p><p>This battle was still undecided, and it ended with both sides suffering.</p><p>With that, the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor still had six people, while the Qin heaven Starfield only had nine people left.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. In the direction of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, a sword light flashed, and a black-robed young man landed on the battle stage.</p><p>This black-clothed young man carried a long sword on his back. His body was straight, like a divine sword.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine power in his body erupted like a volcano, and a beam of sword Qi shot into the sky.</p><p>“What a terrifying sword intent!”</p><p>Many people were shocked when they sensed the terrifying sword intent.</p><p>Even mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and the others were shocked.</p><p>This person was also at the divine Son level. He controlled divine-grade divine power and his cultivation was at the sixth level of the heavenly deity realm. Moreover, he was a terrifying sword cultivator.</p><p>I’m Absolute Sword. You’re also a sword cultivator. Come down and fight. Let me see what kind of strength the Qin heaven star region’s Absolute Sword cultivator has!</p><p>The eyes of the sword of extinction looked at the sword way of Infinity, and his eyes were like a divine sword.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>His swordsmanship was boundless, and he also revealed a strong fighting will. He took a step forward and appeared on the fighting ring. His body also burst out with a shocking sword will.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Before the two of them had even started fighting, their sword intents were already clashing in the void, triggering streams of sword Qi that spread in all directions.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Their eyes met, and two tiny sword Qi shot out from their eyes, clashing in the air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the sound of two swords resounded through the sky.</p><p>The two of them drew their swords at the same time. The sword light was as bright as the stars, so bright that some people couldn’t even open their eyes.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In midair, the sound of intense clashes could be heard.</p><p>The crowd could no longer see the two figures. They could only see two sword lights clashing and crisscrossing on the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
