For example, some of the weaker ones in the top ten sects didn’t even get an array plate.</p><p>Without an array plate, it was almost equivalent to losing the qualification to compete for the star core.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across and he noticed a few Divine King powerhouses from Dragon Boat Mountain and Kong Xuan sect not far away.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and realized that the Supreme Holy Son, the transient light Holy Son, and the rest had already gathered around Dragon Boat Mountain and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming is really lucky …”</p><p>The Supreme Holy son’s face darkened when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at the Supreme Saint son, the transient light Saint son, and the others. The latter shivered and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not make a move here, nor did he reveal the fact that the Supreme Holy Son had colluded with mo jiuye to kill him.</p><p>The founding member of the Supreme clan, Supreme elder, was also here. Lu Ming knew that even if he told the truth now, he would not be able to kill Supreme universe. He might as well not say anything. When he had the chance in the future, he would naturally get rid of Supreme universe.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how many array plates did you get?”</p><p>When they saw Lu Ming, Dragon Boat Mountain’s gaze turned to him with a look of hope.</p><p>“Sect master, I’m useless. I didn’t get a single array plate this time.”</p><p>Lu Ming pretended to cup his fists and put on a ‘ashamed’ look.</p><p>“You didn’t get it? Don’t try to lie to this Lord!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s face sank, and a hint of gloominess flashed through his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re spouting nonsense. You’ve already obtained an array plate on the first planet you’ve entered. How dare you lie to the sect master? How dare you!”</p><p>The Supreme Saint shouted.</p><p>When they first entered the first planet, he competed with Lu Ming and he saw with his own eyes that Lu Ming obtained an array plate.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Upon hearing the words of the Supreme universe, the Dragon Boat Mountain’s gaze turned even gloomier as it swept its gaze over Lu Ming.</p><p>that’s right. In the beginning, I did obtain an array plate. I was going to give it to the sect master, but someone colluded with mo jiuye of the unique devil Academy to frame me. I was chased by mo jiuye, and in order to save my life, I gave that array plate to mo jiuye. Otherwise, I would have been dead.</p><p>Lu Ming began to make up nonsense and even made a false accusation while he looked at universe master coldly.</p><p>don’t you slander me! Who colluded with mo jiuye? ”</p><p>Supreme universe’s expression changed as he shouted.</p><p>“I’m not talking about you. Why are you so nervous?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Supreme universe was at a loss for words. However, he did believe Lu Ming’s words. When mo jiuye chased after Lu Ming, it might be as Lu Ming said. Lu Ming used the array plate in exchange for his life.</p><p>Therefore, he did not refute it.</p><p>“Sect master, if you don’t believe me, I can swear that I don’t have an array plate on me.”</p><p>Lu Ming made a vow.</p><p>He wouldn’t be afraid even if he swore on his life source, because he didn’t have an array plate on him.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s expression was unsightly. If he didn’t have an array token, he wouldn’t be able to enter the galaxy array and participate in the competition for the star core.</p><p>This time, the planetary core was very important to his plan.</p><p>“Haha, sect leader, Lu Ming and the rest did not get any array plates, but I did.”</p><p>At this moment, Supreme universe laughed.</p><p>“You got one?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right. Please take a look, sect master!”</p><p>There was a flash of light in Dragon boat’s hand and an array card appeared. He then cast a smug look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, one piece is enough!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain laughed joyfully. He waved his hand and grabbed the array plate, ” “Supreme universe, you’re very good. This time, I’ll definitely reward you handsomely!”</p><p>“Many thanks, sect master!”</p><p>The universe master bowed and gave Lu Ming a provocative look.</p><p>“This guy actually got an array plate!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>He had sold the array plate to grayflame breaking Army because he didn’t want Dragon Boat Mountain to fight for the star core. He didn’t expect that the Supreme universe would obtain an array plate.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this time, not far away, a ray of light burst out and rushed towards the Galaxy formation.</p><p>It was the demonic Academy’s Dean. He had already impatiently rushed toward the Galaxy great array.</p><p>The other sect Masters and divine kings who had obtained the array plates also moved at the same time, rushing towards the Galaxy array.</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain’s figure also flashed. In the next moment, it appeared in the Galaxy and continued to fly toward the core of the Galaxy. It was so fast that Lu Ming had no idea how it left.</p><p>There were a total of twelve array plates, which meant that twelve terrifying experts had rushed into the Galaxy.</p><p>With the array plate, the Galaxy array did not have any abnormalities.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In just a few breaths, a terrifying rumble erupted from the depths of the Galaxy. Beams of dazzling divine light burst out and illuminated the universe.</p><p>“The godkings are fighting!”</p><p>Someone said with bright eyes.</p><p>Obviously, the fight for the star core had already begun. A terrifying war must have broken out in the depths of the Galaxy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Deep in the core of the planet, the rumbling became more and more intense. Beams of divine light of different colors shone in all directions.</p><p>Even though they were standing outside the Galaxy, they could still feel the slight vibration in the space.</p><p>This was definitely extremely terrifying. One must know that they were standing outside the Galaxy. They could feel the tremors even though they were separated by a Galaxy. It could be seen how intense the battle was.</p><p>A terrifying battle between godkings that could shatter a planet was not just talk.</p><p>The battle continued for a moment. Suddenly, everyone saw a stream of light rushing out of the Galaxy at an astonishing speed.</p><p>There were other streams of light hot on his heels.</p><p>“Could it be that the winner has already been decided and the star core has been obtained?”</p><p>The same thought flashed through everyone’s mind, and they couldn’t help but widen their eyes, wanting to know who had obtained the star core.</p><p>The speed of the light was shockingly fast. In a few breaths, it was about to fly out of the range of the Galaxy.</p><p>“Dragon boats mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>The stream of light that was flying at the very front was the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, hand over the star core!”</p><p>“Don’t even think about taking the star core for yourself!”</p><p>Behind him, a series of angry roars came, shaking the universe and stars.</p><p>It was really the Dragon Boat Mountain that had obtained the star core.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Dragon boats mountain did not say a word. They increased their speed to the maximum and arrived beside Lu Ming and the others in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain waved his hand and a surge of divine power swept up Lu Ming and the others, flying into the distance at high speed.</p><p>The other God King experts of the Kong Xuan sect followed closely behind the dragon boats.</p><p>“Chase them, don’t let them escape!”</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Behind them, the sect Masters of the three Overlord forces roared in anger. They led the experts under their banner and chased after Dragon Boat Mountain’s group in a frenzy.</p><p>In addition, the experts from the other sects had also caught up.</p><p>The Dragon boats carried Lu Ming and the group and flew at an astonishing speed. One planet after another passed by them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
