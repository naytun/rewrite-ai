In fact, in terms of offensive power, he was even weaker than boundless sword Dao. However, mo jiuye’s methods were more bizarre, allowing him to last longer.</p><p>However, he was still no match for the sword of extinction. Under the sword shadow of the sword of extinction, he used all kinds of strange means to hold on for a moment longer than the boundless sword Dao, but he was still seriously injured and was struck off the fighting ring.</p><p>“Good, hahaha!”</p><p>the absolute Sword is indeed a peerless genius. His combat strength is indeed powerful!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, some young men laughed and looked at the people from the Qin Tian Starfield with mocking expressions.</p><p>On the side of the Qin heaven Starfield, it was completely silent. There were countless people around the square, but no one spoke. The atmosphere was extremely oppressive.</p><p>The opponent was a sixth level heavenly deity at the divine Son level. He had defeated two of their peers, mo jiuye and sword Dao Wuji, in a row. This had dealt a heavy blow to the people of the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>Up until now, the other party still had six people, while the Qin heaven Starfield had seven people left.</p><p>In everyone’s eyes, among the remaining seven people, only the red flame demon pine and ice fairy had the real strength to fight with the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s heaven’s pride.</p><p>As for the others, they probably wouldn’t be able to withstand a single move from a heaven’s favorite like the sword of fatality.</p><p>On the other hand, there were still six people on the other side. Each of them looked unfathomable, and it was unknown how strong they were.</p><p>How was he going to fight this battle?</p><p>“Don’t tell me we’ve lost for sure? Only ten years left?”</p><p>Many people were in despair.</p><p>More people could only remain silent and hope for a miracle.</p><p>“Who’s up, you two?”</p><p>After defeating two people in a row, the sword of fatality was full of fighting spirit. His eyes were fixed on the red flame demon pine and ice immortal. As for the others, he didn’t care about them.</p><p>The red flame magic pine and ice fairy looked at each other. They saw that Lu Ming had no intention of going on stage, so they could only go first.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>The red flame magic pine roared and rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>you’ve used up a lot of Shen power. I didn’t want to take advantage of you, but this competition is a tag-team battle, so don’t say that I won without honor!</p><p>Scarlet Flame demonic pine said in a deep voice. As he spoke, he took a few steps towards the invincible sword. With each step, his aura grew stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Blazing flames burst out of his body. These flames were extremely viscous, as if they were magma.</p><p>seventh level celestial deity! Scarlet Flame demonic pine’s cultivation is seventh level celestial deity!</p><p>Someone exclaimed. Following that, many people from the Qin heaven Starfield were overjoyed.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demon pine’s cultivation actually already reached seventh level celestial deity. There was hope with this.</p><p>“Seventh level heavenly deity? Haha, it’s more interesting this way. Come on!”</p><p>The sword of fatality showed no fear. Sword shadows kept appearing around him.</p><p>“Myriad sword domain, God slaying myriad swords, kill!”</p><p>die! the sword of fatality shouted coldly. He pressed forward with both hands, and endless sword shadows rushed toward the red flame demonic pine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demon let out a roar, and then its body swelled up rapidly, turning into an ancient God.</p><p>The ancient God that the red flame magic pine had turned into was also an orange-armored ancient God that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p>Back then, Bing Qing had told Lu Ming that there were a total of four geniuses in the Qin heaven Galaxy who had cultivated the ancient God Body. They were sword Dao Wu Ji, mo jiuye, red flame mo song, and ice immortal.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame demon transformed into an ancient God Body as soon as it made its move. At the same time, the surface of its ancient God Body was covered with scorching flames.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had fused his talent secret skill with his ancient God Body, making him even more powerful.</p><p>“Falling star!”</p><p>The red flame demonic pine roared and punched out with both fists. His fists seemed to have turned into magma, and the magma turned into two huge meteorites, filled with raging flames, and blasted toward the sword of fatality.</p><p>The temperature in the fighting ring rose sharply.</p><p>ancient God Body again. Defeat!</p><p>die! the sword of fatality shouted, and thousands of sword shadows converged into a long river, rushing toward the red flame demonic pine.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The attacks of both sides collided, causing a series of explosions. At the beginning, the two of them fought intensely, and it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>However, after a while, the fist power of the red flame demon pine skyrocketed. The magma fist continued to bombard, crushing the thousands of sword shadows and attacking the absolute Sword.</p><p>After all, the sword of fatality had fought two battles in a row and had used up a lot of his divine power. On the other hand, the red flame demonic pine’s cultivation was at the seventh-level celestial deity realm, which was not something that boundless sword Dao and Mo jiuye could compare to.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s defeated!”</p><p>Red flame demonic pine shouted and continued to punch with its Hill-like fist.</p><p>The sky trembled, and the temperature was terrifyingly high. The air was about to burn up, and huge meteorites kept smashing toward the absolute Sword.</p><p>don’t be happy too early. Heaven-extinguishing strike!</p><p>The sword of fatality shouted in a low voice, and a terrifying sword Qi burst out from his eyes. He waved his hands, and the sword shadows that filled the sky actually gathered into one.</p><p>The body of the absolute Sword seemed to merge with the thousands of sword shadows, turning into an extremely bright sword light.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light broke the attack of several meteorites at once and headed toward the red flame demonic pine.</p><p>This was the most powerful strike of the sword of fatality. It was so powerful that the red flame demonic pine’s pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>myriad divine fists, star explosion, kill, kill, kill!</p><p>The red flame magic pine roared to the sky. All the flames in its body gathered on its fists. In an instant, it had punched thousands of times.</p><p>Thousands of punches were thrown out in an instant. From an outsider’s point of view, it was as if thousands of fist shadows had suddenly appeared in front of the red flame demonic pine. These thousands of fist shadows were completely condensed from flames and then rushed towards the sword of fatality.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening boom erupted in the fighting ring. The entire fighting ring was shaking. The endless force was scattered in all directions, but it was blocked by the battle formation.</p><p>Many people with weak cultivation could only see the flames and sword light that filled the sky, blocking the red flame demonic pine and the invincible sword.</p><p>“Who can win?”</p><p>Many people were staring at the fighting ring unblinkingly, not even daring to blink, afraid of missing out on an exciting scene.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>On the fighting ring, there was a huge figure that was retreating.</p><p>“Not good, it’s the red flame magic pine, he’s retreating!”</p><p>The expressions of the people from the Qin heaven Starfield changed drastically, and their hearts sank.</p><p>However, what made them happy the next moment was that the figure of the invincible sword was thrown out like a cannonball. He flew out of the fighting stage and fell out of it. He staggered back a few hundred meters before he could stabilize himself. Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>He won!</p><p>Many people were overjoyed. The red flame demon pine was still standing on the battle platform, but the figure of the sword of fatality had already fallen off the battle platform. Naturally, the red flame demon pine had won.</p><p>“The red flame magic pine is also injured!”</p><p>Someone else spoke, and the joy on everyone’s faces faded.</p><p>Indeed, the red flame magic pine was also injured. A deep sword wound appeared on his chest, almost cutting his body diagonally, and blood kept flowing out.</p><p>Although the red flame demonic pine had defeated the sword of fatality, it had also been severely injured.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region had only won a small battle, but the situation was still very unfavorable for them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
