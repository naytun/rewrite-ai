Supreme Being Dong let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying a few thousand miles away. He spat out a large mouthful of blood as half of his body exploded. He looked as miserable as he could be.</p><p>Even Supreme universe, who was beside Supreme movement, was affected. His lower body was shattered, and he floated in the air with a look of horror as he screamed repeatedly.</p><p>When the other two godkings of the Supreme clan saw this, their expressions changed drastically. Without even thinking, they split into two directions and flew off at high speed, leaving the Supreme clan behind to deal with them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, leave the two traitors to us!”</p><p>At that moment, the two elders flew past Lu Ming and chased after the two God kings from the Supreme clan.</p><p>They were two extremely powerful elders of the Kong Xuan sect. They were both at the second tier of the God King realm.</p><p>The two godkings from the Supreme clan who had escaped were only at the first level of the Godking realm. They were unable to escape from the pursuit of a second level Godking.</p><p>You long stopped and looked at Supreme move and Supreme universe with his cold eyes.</p><p>Both Supreme movement and Supreme universe revealed looks of despair.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’m begging you. Spare me. As long as you spare me, I’ll be your slave and follow you wholeheartedly.”</p><p>All of a sudden, universe master screamed and begged Lu Ming for mercy.</p><p>“Qian Kun, what are you doing? If you want to die, then die. Why do you have to beg for mercy from him? the men of my Supreme family, even if you die, you must die with a backbone!”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong shouted.</p><p>“Shut up. If you want to die, I don’t want to accompany you …”</p><p>Supreme universe shouted at Supreme Being Dong with a malevolent expression.</p><p>He was the Son of Heaven. He had a bright future. With his talent, breaking through to the divine King realm was almost certain.</p><p>Once he reached the God King realm, his lifespan would increase exponentially, allowing him to live for five star years. With such a long lifespan, how much happiness could he enjoy? why did he have to die?</p><p>In order to live, he could give up any backbone.</p><p>Immediately, the universe master turned to look at Lu Ming with a fawning expression.”Lu Ming, no, Holy Son Lu Ming, as long as you let me go, I’ll do anything you want. I’ll be loyal to you in the future!”</p><p>“He really is shameless!”</p><p>I’ve really misjudged him in the past. Someone like him can actually become the number one Saint of our Kong Xuan sect. Pfft!</p><p>Seeing the Supreme Holy son’s face, many of the Kong Xuan sect disciples looked at him with disdain.</p><p>“Oh, if you want me to let you go, it’s not impossible. How about this, you go kill him, and I’ll let you go.”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the Supreme martial artist.</p><p>“Kill him? However, he’s a Divine King expert. I’m not his match at all!”</p><p>Supreme universe said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“That’s easy, you long …”</p><p>Lu Ming sent you long a voice transmission.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Dark Dragon roared and pounced toward the Supreme martial artist.</p><p>At this moment, Supreme Being Dong had already suffered heavy injuries and was unable to escape at all. He could only barely resist. However, Dark Dragon’s Dragon Claw swiped down and sent Supreme Being Dong flying.</p><p>This time, Supreme martial artist Dong’s injuries were even more severe. His entire body was in tatters, and even his divine flame had almost been extinguished. His strength was reduced to less than one-thousandth of what it had been.</p><p>“Now, he doesn’t have much strength left. Go and kill him. I promise you, as long as you kill him, I will definitely not kill you.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go kill him!”</p><p>Supreme universe gritted his teeth and charged towards Supreme move.</p><p>“Supreme universe, you dare?”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong roared in anger, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had not expected that the universe master would really want to kill him.</p><p>“The Supreme Being moved. Didn’t you say that I was the future hope of the Supreme Being clan? As long as I’m alive, the Supreme clan will be able to rise in the future. Do you understand?”</p><p>Supreme universe secretly transmitted a message to Supreme Being Dong. At the same time, his body glowed and he used the Supreme divine fist to attack Supreme Being Dong.</p><p>“You disobedient son!”</p><p>Zhi Zun Dong bellowed. He was extremely disappointed with the Supreme universe master. Moreover, he did not want to be captured without putting up a fight. He would rather die at Lu Ming’s hands than at the hands of the Supreme universe master. If he really died at the hands of the Supreme universe master, the reputation of the Supreme universe family would go down in history for thousands of years and they would become a laughingstock.</p><p>Thus, the Autarch began to resist.</p><p>He mustered up his remaining strength and also punched out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The attacks of Supreme movement and Supreme universe collided, causing a dazzling golden light to burst out. Then, the two of them retreated rapidly.</p><p>“You … If you still want to resist, die!”</p><p>The universe master roared in anger. In order to express his loyalty to Lu Ming, his eyes turned red as he charged at the universe master in a frenzy.</p><p>However, Supreme movement was still a second tier Godking. Although he was heavily injured and on the verge of death, he was still very strong when he went all out. He fought with Supreme universe and it was difficult to tell who was winning.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>At this moment, the other two first level Godking experts from the Supreme clan had already been taken down by the two second level Godking experts from the Kong Xuan sect and had their cultivation crippled.</p><p>A large number of Kong Xuan sect elders and disciples surrounded the area, watching the battle between the universe Supreme and the universe Supreme from afar.</p><p>The people from the three Chiefs and some of the top forces had already escaped. Lu Ming did not let you long pursue them.</p><p>With you Long’s current state, he could still slightly suppress the deans of the unique demon Academy. However, it was impossible for him to kill the other party.</p><p>You Long’s current state was that with the strength of his physical body, his defense was shocking. It was more than enough to protect himself, but his attack power was insufficient.</p><p>Therefore, he could only let the other party escape.</p><p>“Die! Old man, why are you still resisting? die!”</p><p>The universe God had gone completely berserk, and he was constantly charging at the Autarch.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them were already injured on top of their injuries.</p><p>“Lu Ming, kill me. Just kill me!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist roared, wanting to die in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“There’s a Supreme family’s dog at my command, why should I do it myself?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>When universe master heard this, he burned with anger. However, he did not dare to show it for fear of causing Lu Ming’s dissatisfaction.</p><p>He could only vent all his anger on the Supreme martial artist.</p><p>“AI, forget it, forget it!”</p><p>At this moment, the Grandmaster sighed. He didn’t want to resist any longer. If he continued, he would only become a laughingstock.</p><p>Supreme movement suddenly retracted all of its divine power and did not continue to resist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Supreme universe’s fist landed on Supreme Being Dong’s head, causing his head to explode.</p><p>The Paragon moved, and fell!</p><p>A Godking of a generation had died at the hands of a junior he valued the most. It was truly a great tragedy.</p><p>“Hahaha, old man, you’re finally dead. Hahaha …”</p><p>The universe master laughed madly. After a long while, he stopped and looked at Lu Ming with a flattering expression.”Holy Son Lu Ming, look! I’ve already killed the Supreme Being!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
