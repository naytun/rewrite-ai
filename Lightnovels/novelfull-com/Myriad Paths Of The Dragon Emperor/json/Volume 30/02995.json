Jin Yuan could tell the degree of the awakening of the young man’s divine power. It was equivalent to an 80% awakening.</p><p>even the two of them can pass. I have awakened eighty percent of my divine power. That’s enough!</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said coldly. Then, he stepped forward and stepped into the heavenly gate.</p><p>However, when he stepped into the sky Gate, his expression turned serious.</p><p>Although he had said that the difficulty of the sky Gate had been reduced, he didn’t dare to relax in the slightest and was on full alert.</p><p>When he was halfway to the sky Gate, he stopped moving, just like Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the yellow-robed young man. If the yellow-robed young man could pass through the sky Gate, it meant that the difficulty of the sky Gate had indeed been reduced.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two minutes had passed.</p><p>Suddenly, the yellow-robed youth’s body trembled.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p><p>Then, the yellow-robed young man let out a blood-curdling screech. His body flew out of the heavenly gate as if he had been hit by a giant beast. He crashed onto the ground and spat out a large mouthful of blood. His aura was extremely weak.</p><p>Everyone saw that there was a crack between the yellow-robed young man’s eyebrows, from which blood was flowing.</p><p>The yellow-robed young man’s eyes were filled with fear. He had almost died.</p><p>It was obvious that the yellow-robed youth had failed!</p><p>He had been defeated so badly that he had almost been left behind forever.</p><p>the difficulty of the Heaven’s Gate has not decreased at all!</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>Everyone’s attention returned to Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>The difficulty of the Heaven’s Gate was not reduced, but Lu Ming and Qiu Yue took five minutes each to pass it. From this, it could be seen that the two of them were terrifyingly talented.</p><p>In particular, Jin Xing, Jin Yuan, and a few other paragons who had passed through the Heaven’s Gate looked at Lu Ming with killing intent and solemness.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ll leave it to you to enter star-moon ancient city. Lu Ming must die in the ancient city!”</p><p>At this moment, a few of the Qin clan’s geniuses were secretly sending messages to the other geniuses.</p><p>He was sending messages to a few geniuses of the aristocratic families that were on good terms with the Qin family.</p><p>don’t worry. As long as we meet him in star-moon ancient city, we won’t let him come out alive!</p><p>The geniuses from the aristocratic families replied.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming seemed to have sensed something. He suddenly turned to look in the direction of the Qin family’s Paragon.</p><p>Just now, he had felt many killing intents land on him.</p><p>it seems that other than the Jin family and the Qin family, there are still geniuses from other aristocratic families who want to kill me!</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>If they wanted to kill him, they had to be prepared to be killed by him!</p><p>Following that, more people chose to enter through the door.</p><p>“Qiuyue, let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at it for a while and lost interest. He held Qiu Yue’s hand and walked toward the passage.</p><p>“Yes, let’s go too!”</p><p>the experts have all made their moves. There’s nothing to see now. It’s boring to watch people climb through the dog gate!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and Qiu Yue left, the others could not sit still any longer. They moved one after another and walked into the passage.</p><p>Inside the passageway was not star-moon ancient city, but a door of light.</p><p>a teleportation gate. It seems like this is the gate that leads to the inner part of star-moon ancient city!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped into the door of light with Qiu Yue.</p><p>After that, the others stepped into the light door and disappeared.</p><p>After most of the people had entered the door of light, the people outside also moved.</p><p>Some of them bowed and crawled through the dog gate with red faces. Then, they ran with their heads down and entered the light gate.</p><p>After more than half a day, everyone had entered the light door, leaving Bai Li alone outside.</p><p>all the heaven’s favorites from the four Heavenly King manors are here. I hope they won’t suffer too many losses this time. I also hope they will gain something!</p><p>Bai Li muttered and sat down cross-legged outside.</p><p>He was going to wait here for ten years.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stepped through the door of light, he felt as if he was traversing through the void. The next moment, Lu Ming found himself in a Canyon.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned because he realized that Qiu Yue was not by his side.</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and looked around. In the end, he realized that he was in a primeval forest and Qiu Yue was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>I’ve miscalculated. It turns out that the teleportation to star-moon ancient city is random!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and could not help but feel worried.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation was the weakest among the geniuses who entered star-moon ancient city this time around. She was only a second-level heavenly God.</p><p>If he ran into someone with ill intentions, he would probably be in danger.</p><p>“Qiuyue is also a person of great fortune, she should be fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming consoled himself. He took out the voice transmission jade talisman and realized that he could not transmit his voice.</p><p>I’d better cultivate while I look for Qiu Yue!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then looked around.</p><p>In the end, he realized that he didn’t know where he was at all. He was surrounded by the primeval forest.</p><p>I didn’t expect that there would be a primeval forest in star-moon ancient city!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then chose a random direction and flew forward.</p><p>The primitive forest was dense with vegetation and dense divine Qi, but there was not a single living being.</p><p>There were no divine beasts or desolate beasts. It was deathly silent.</p><p>After flying for a few hours, Lu Ming was still in the primeval forest.</p><p>I’m so unlucky. I was teleported to the wilderness as soon as I came in!</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. He transformed into a kun Peng and flew across the nine Heavens.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming flew for a day before he finally flew out of the primeval forest and saw the buildings.</p><p>There were many palaces built on a mountain peak ahead.</p><p>Only after flying in did he realize that these palaces were already very dilapidated, and only ruins were left.</p><p>However, it was left behind from the early days of the heaven Palace era after all. Lu Ming was very curious and planned to go in and take a look.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, a boom erupted from the ruins. Divine power surged, and shattered stone flew everywhere.</p><p>Then, two figures flew out from the ruins and fought fiercely in the air.</p><p>It was obvious that the two of them were the geniuses of the universal camp, and they were currently engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>However, when they saw Lu Ming, they were shocked and retreated.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>When the two of them saw Lu Ming, they immediately recognized him.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had passed through the Heaven’s Gate previously and the prodigies of the universal camp had remembered him.</p><p>“It’s this brat. Previously, the Qin family asked my Sun family to help them kill this person. It seems that my luck is not bad to have met this person the moment I arrived!”</p><p>“Furthermore, this person’s talent is so high. He might have a great opportunity on him. If I kill him, his opportunity will be mine!</p><p>One of the big-nosed young men’s eyes flickered with killing intent, but at the same time, there was also greed.</p><p>“Wang Tong, let’s forget about today’s matter. You can go. I won’t argue with you!”</p><p>Thinking of this, the big-nosed young man looked at the person who had just fought with him and said, “</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
