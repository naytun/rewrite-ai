I don’t know who’s the backer behind Magic City mountain. I only know that there’s a backer behind Magic City mountain …</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>“You still dare to trick me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He exerted force in his palm. Wan Xing screamed in pain as his body exploded continuously.</p><p>I really don’t know, I really don’t know. I’m going to kill you!</p><p>All evil roared angrily and mustered all its remaining strength to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He exerted force in his palm and Wan Xing exploded completely, his soul scattered.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming cast the moon splitting move. A crescent-shaped spear ray flashed and disappeared.</p><p>When the Spear’s radiance disappeared, all evil disappeared as well.</p><p>Lu Ming did not show any mercy to people like Wan Xing who were evil.</p><p>The father and son duo had committed all sorts of evil deeds. They controlled the Colosseum and committed all sorts of crimes. In all these years, countless people had died at their hands.</p><p>Lu Ming did not search all evil’s soul as there was no need to. He threatened him with Wan Xing. Since the other party said that he did not know, he should really not know.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the loathsome storage ring. Then, his figure flashed, and he returned to the spirit beast arena.</p><p>At this moment, almost all the demonic city guards in the Colosseum had run away. Only that young man was still fighting with another demon master.</p><p>Although the demon master had the upper hand, the young man was fighting with no regard for his life. He kept the demon master busy and didn’t care even if he was injured.</p><p>At that moment, the demon master was almost scared to death when he saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged over directly.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s participation, the demon master’s fate was sealed. It did not take long for him to be killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This brother, thank you for saving me this time!”</p><p>The young man cupped his fists at Lu Ming, his face full of gratitude.</p><p>“You’re welcome, it was just a passing move!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a wave of his hand, he kept the demon master’s storage ring.</p><p>“You’re also a heaven’s favorite from the outside world, right? I’m really curious, why are there so many people here this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the young man.</p><p>what are you saying? we came to Magic City mountain this time to complete a mission!</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>“Mission?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. This was indeed unexpected.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’re here to complete the mission from the star sky Battalion? The universal camp is starting to recruit new students again?”</p><p>At this time, Wu Zifeng suddenly spoke.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had brought Qiu Yue, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong with him. The three of them were right beside him.</p><p>“You know?”</p><p>The young man was stunned and looked at Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“This one is Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng cupped his fists.</p><p>so you’re a disciple of the Wu family. No wonder. I’m yang Xi. You’re right, this is indeed a mission given to us by the universal camp. If you want to join the universal camp, you have to go through an assessment. This time, our assessment is to obtain the demon Lord’s token and the Demon King’s token of the demon Capital Mountain!</p><p>demon Capital Mountain’s Demon Lord and Demon King, they all have a token that symbolizes their identity. Only by obtaining the demon Capital Mountain’s Demon Lord and Demon King token can one join the universal camp!</p><p>The young man explained.</p><p>“The universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming was confused.</p><p>brother Lu, the universal camp is the gathering place for the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s Army. Almost all of the strongest paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion are gathered in the universal camp!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained.</p><p>“Oh, I see. Is the cultivation environment in the star sky Camp that good? There are so many paragons in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and they’re all gathered there?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious.</p><p>the cultivation environment is one thing. The main thing is that only by joining the universal camp can one be recommended to cultivate in the core Holy cultivation ground of the great void Holy dynasty. If one wants to rise in the great void Holy dynasty and take up a high position, this is something that can not be avoided!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood. This was a little like the imperial examination in the mortal world. One had to take one step at a time according to the rules and procedures before one could ascend to a high position.</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction of the city Lord’s residence.</p><p>He finally knew why these elites had suddenly attacked the city Lord’s mansion. It was because of the demon Lord and Demon King tokens.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming made the first move. He was like a fuse that ignited the battle. In fact, even if he did not make a move, those prodigies would find an opportunity to make a move.</p><p>“You guys stay here, I’ll go take a look!”</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, his body shrank and returned to his normal form.</p><p>As his cultivation level increased, his divine body became stronger and stronger. The time he could take to transform into an ancient God Body also became longer.</p><p>This was the benefit of having abundant physical strength.</p><p>“Young master, be careful!”</p><p>Qiu Yue reminded.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew in the direction of the city Lord’s residence.</p><p>Qiu Yue and the others didn’t follow, neither did Yang Xi. He had been injured and needed time to heal.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived near the city master’s residence.</p><p>However, he didn’t make a move. Instead, he found a hidden place nearby and hid. Then, he took out a divine pill and swallowed it.</p><p>This kind of divine pill could recover one’s strength.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was injured previously and needed time to recuperate. There might be a huge battle to fight later on.</p><p>This matter was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>In this case, it was almost impossible to protect Magic City mountain and it would be destroyed.</p><p>If Lu Ming wanted to find out which force the dark ice Race and the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were colluding with, he could only rely on the dark night Devil King.</p><p>Lu Ming was waiting, waiting for the night Demon King to appear.</p><p>In the sky above the city Lord’s mansion, the battle was unusually brutal. Demonic city guards were constantly killed, and their corpses fell to the ground.</p><p>The city Lord’s mansion was covered with the corpses of the Shanghai guards.</p><p>The remaining four demon masters were also suppressed by the four ninth-level celestial deities and were in a precarious situation.</p><p>“I’ll fight it out with you guys!”</p><p>die! a demon master roared angrily. The divine power in his body started to burn as he fought fiercely with the ninth-level celestial deity.</p><p>At the same time, the other three demon masters also gritted their teeth and burned their divine power to charge forward with all their might, trying to escape.</p><p>“You want to escape? dream on!”</p><p>The four ninth-level heavenly deity heaven’s favorites shouted coldly. They didn’t seek to gain any merits, but they wanted to avoid any mistakes. They changed their strategy and only held the other party back tightly, no longer taking the initiative to attack.</p><p>There was a time limit to burning Shen power. Soon, their Shen power would be used up and they would be at their mercy.</p><p>Sure enough, not long after, the auras of the four demon masters rapidly declined.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword was deafening. The black-robed young man slashed his sword across the sky and killed a demon master.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The young man, who was covered in golden light, killed a demon master with one palm.</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother, the blood-robed young man, had also killed a demon master.</p><p>Demon King, Demon King!…</p><p>The last demon master roared madly, his face full of unwillingness. However, before he could finish his words, he was also killed.</p><p>At this point, the nine great demon masters of demonic city were all exterminated!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
