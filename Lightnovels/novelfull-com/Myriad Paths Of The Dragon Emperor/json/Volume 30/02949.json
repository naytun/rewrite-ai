Ah, I want you dead, I want you dead!”</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm shrieked, her eyes bloodshot.</p><p>She opened her mouth and mist kept spewing out, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shrouded in a cloud of fog.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Dragon roars could be heard from within the mist. Then, six nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared. Each of them was ten thousand meters long. They roared into the sky, and their Dragon might filled the air.</p><p>The six nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced out and unleashed a vast amount of energy. The mist was immediately dispersed in all directions.</p><p>The kun Peng’s body flashed and Lu Ming appeared in front of the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm was shocked. She quickly retreated and pushed with both hands. A few giant pythons condensed and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, when the six nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced over, the giant python was crushed into pieces.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced out and struck the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm. The woman let out a blood-curdling screech and followed in Yuan Shan’s footsteps. She crashed into the city wall and spat out a large mouthful of blood. It was unknown how many bones in her body were broken.</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm was only a sixth level heavenly deity. Even if she could control divine-grade divine energy, she was only about the same as Qin wuyou.</p><p>However, her methods were rather strange and could directly harm the soul. That was why Lu Ming was delayed for some time.</p><p>Now that the mist was useless against Lu Ming, the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm naturally could not withstand a blow.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted coldly. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma form continued to charge at the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>Since the other party wanted to kill her, Lu Ming would not let him off.</p><p>“No, Ape City Master, save me!”</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm shouted in fear.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The city Lord of the ape Demon City shouted and rushed out. With a punch, he destroyed the nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma and saved the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>“Ninth level heavenly deity?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The cultivation of the city Lord of ape Demon City was one level higher than that of general Demon City.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was fearless and faced him from a distance.</p><p>“Ape City Master, are you trying to break the rules?”</p><p>Yan Zhi roared.</p><p>According to the rules, the older generation couldn’t interfere. Otherwise, the city Lord of the demon City could go to the demon capital to impeach the city Lord of the ape Demon City.</p><p>Hmph, who said I’m going to break the rules? it’s just that the outcome of the battle has already been decided. Why would I need to kill him? ”</p><p>The city Lord of ape Demon City said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered but did not continue to attack.</p><p>He was not afraid of the city Lord of the demonic Ape City. However, if he were to fight with the city Lord, he was afraid that he would reveal some of his trump cards. In demonic city, Lu Ming always felt that it was better to keep some of his trump cards.</p><p>Ape City Lord, we have won this battle. The spirit Lake should be ours!</p><p>Yan Zhi shouted.</p><p>The city Lord’s face darkened.</p><p>Before he could arrive, the devil general city had actually invited such a powerful heaven’s favorite. Even the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm was not her match.</p><p>“Take it!”</p><p>With a cold face, the city Lord of ape Demon City waved his hand and a token flew to Yan Zhi, who caught it in his hand.</p><p>Yan Zhi was overjoyed when he saw the token in his hand.</p><p>With this token, the spirit Lake would belong to general Devil City. In the future, general Devil city’s strength would definitely increase.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The city Lord of ape Demon City snorted and turned to walk into the city.</p><p>The others also turned around and left.</p><p>“Brat, kill Xiao Lu. I’ll remember this!”</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and flew into the city.</p><p>“Brother Lu, it’s all thanks to you this time!”</p><p>Yan Zhi came to Lu Ming and thanked him.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, as long as you can help me get into Magic City, it’s fine.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>that’s for sure. Let’s go back!</p><p>Yan Zhi said. Then, the three of them headed toward general Demon City.</p><p>Not long after, in the main hall of the devil general city.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, good, good!”</p><p>The general Devil City Master looked at the token in his hand and laughed out loud.</p><p>He had competed with the ape Demon City for many years and had been suppressed for many years. Now that he had finally won, he was naturally happy.</p><p>“City Lord Yan, where are my friends?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Hearing this, the city Lord of the devil-general city’s expression changed slightly. He smiled and said, ” your friends are all cultivating in seclusion. It will take some time for them to come out. Brother Lu, you can stay here for a while. Haha!</p><p>“Closed-door training?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>The general Devil City Lord was lying. He wouldn’t take long to compete with the ape Devil City. Qiu Yue and the others would never choose to go into seclusion at this time.</p><p>Moreover, the three of them were in closed-door cultivation.</p><p>“City Lord Yan, where are my friends? I want to see them!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice became more serious. He obviously did not believe the other party.</p><p>little brother Lu, they’re really in closed-door cultivation …</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of Lu Ming’s body, and a terrifying pressure filled the hall.</p><p>Yan Zhi’s face changed, and he quickly retreated behind the general Devil city’s city Lord.</p><p>The city Lord of general Devil city’s face darkened and kept changing.</p><p>“Tell me, where’s my friend? don’t try to fool me with the excuse of closed-door cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heavy, and there was a faint icy killing intent.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>At this time, the city Lord of the devil-general city suddenly heaved a long sigh and said, ” that’s right. They’re not in seclusion. They’re no longer in general Devil City!</p><p>“He’s not in general Demon City? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned even colder. He could barely suppress the anger in his heart.</p><p>“They’ve been taken away!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, it’s better if you don’t ask. You can’t afford to offend the other party.”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>“Speak, who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, I think you should just leave. Just treat your friends as dead!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>His words made the aura on Lu Ming’s body become even more violent, like a volcano about to erupt.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was icy cold, exuding a cold killing intent.</p><p>His patience had reached its limit.</p><p>sigh, since brother Lu is so persistent, I’ll tell you!</p><p>The general Demon City Master sighed and took a few steps forward, approaching Lu Ming as if he wanted to tell him something.</p><p>However, just as the demon city’s City Master was about to approach Lu Ming, a cold murderous intent burst out from his eyes. He shouted coldly, ” “Go to hell!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A demonic blade was aimed at Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming was furious. His divine power erupted like a volcano. At the same time, he activated the battle character formula, which multiplied his combat power by four. An ice chain flew out from between his eyebrows and blocked the attack of the general Demon city’s city Lord.</p><p>The general Demon city’s city Lord retreated quickly after his attack missed. He took Yan Zhi and retreated far away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
