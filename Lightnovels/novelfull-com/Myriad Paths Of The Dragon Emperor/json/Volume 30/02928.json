He’s the most powerful heaven’s favorite, the ice immortal!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. No wonder she looked similar to Bing Qing.</p><p>Back then, Bing Qing had told him that in the ancient God World, there were four people who had cultivated the ancient God Body, and his seventh brother was one of them.</p><p>However, this name was really feminine.</p><p>However, the temperament of the ice fairy was quite in line with this name.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as she came out, a hot aura came from the other side. Then, a burly young man walked over and appeared on the other side of her.</p><p>“Red flame demon pine!”</p><p>Someone spoke out the person’s name.</p><p>This young man was a peerless heaven’s favorite of the red flame race, who was as famous as the ice fairy.</p><p>The appearance of the ice fairy and the red flame demon pine made the Golden-robed young man’s eyes slightly narrow.</p><p>That was because the two of them gave him a lot of pressure.</p><p>interesting. I didn’t expect that the Qin heaven Starfield would actually give birth to so many interesting geniuses!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man said coldly. However, his expression finally became more cautious and did not reveal his lazy expression.</p><p>“Do your words from before still count?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke.</p><p>What he was asking was naturally what the other party had said. As long as the Qin heaven Starfield’s geniuses could defeat them, they would give the Qin heaven Starfield some time and extend the deadline for this matter.</p><p>of course it counts. As long as you can defeat us, we can give you a hundred years!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth said.</p><p>a hundred years is too short. As long as we defeat you, you will have to leave the Qin heaven Starfield forever and never commit this crime again!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>withdraw forever? you’re so arrogant. That’s impossible!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth’s face darkened as he coldly said.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you guys not confident?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>what a joke! Although you have a few geniuses, you think you can defeat us with just a few of you? what a joke!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth laughed coldly.</p><p>“Then why wouldn’t I dare to agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming retorted sarcastically.</p><p>“If you don’t agree, it’s a matter of principle. It doesn’t mean that you have a chance of winning. It’s absolutely impossible for you to withdraw forever, but I can report to the higher-ups and delay it for a while!”</p><p>After the young man in the Golden robe finished speaking, he took out a voice transmission jade talisman and sent a message. Then, he waited quietly.</p><p>Not long after, the Golden-robed young man received a reply. His expression changed and he said, ” if you can defeat us, we can give you a thousand years at most. This is the longest limit. Of course, you have no chance!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man was still full of confidence.</p><p>we’ll only know if there’s a chance after we fight. A thousand years is a thousand years, so be it. Let’s fight!</p><p>Lu Ming agreed immediately.</p><p>Mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, Azure Flame Army breaker, red flame demon pine, ice fairy, and the rest of the strongest heaven’s favorites did not say anything, which meant that they had silently agreed.</p><p>Many people found it strange that mo jiuye and the rest did not stop Lu Ming from acting on his own accord.</p><p>In front of these divine sons, did Lu Ming have the right?</p><p>Of course, they did not know that mo jiuye and the others knew Lu Ming’s strength. They had long treated Lu Ming as someone on the same level as them.</p><p>As for the ice fairy, although the red flame demonic pine had never fought with Lu Ming, they were well-informed and naturally knew about the fight between Lu Ming and Mo jiuye.</p><p>Therefore, they did not object to Lu Ming’s decision.</p><p>If he could fight for a thousand years, it would be good enough. It was much better than ten years.</p><p>wait a minute, now is not the time for a battle. The battle will be held in three months, right here!</p><p>The gold-robed youth suddenly said.</p><p>three months later? that’s fine too!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea and nodded in agreement.</p><p>He understood that the reason why the other party had delayed for three months was most likely because there were still heaven’s favorites who had yet to arrive. However, how could he not need time?</p><p>“How should we fight in three months? What are the rules?”</p><p>Ice immortal asked.</p><p>it’s very simple. We’ll have an arena battle. Both sides will be the defending side. Whoever stands on the arena last will win. Of course, there must be a limit to the number of people on both sides. Otherwise, the competition will be endless!</p><p>how about this, I’ll give you all a chance. I’ll send nine people, and you can send eighteen. How about it? ”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth said.</p><p>“Alright, it’s decided then!”</p><p>Ice fairy immediately agreed.</p><p>He would be a bastard if he didn’t take advantage of the situation. Although numbers didn’t have much use in a battle between top heaven’s favorites, this was an arena battle. Both sides were defending the arena and they used a wheel battle. If they had more people, they could still exhaust the other side’s divine power.</p><p>It was more or less useful.</p><p>“Then it’s decided. Three months later, we’ll fight here. Let me see what kind of combat power you Qin Tian Starfield’s younger generation has. Let’s go!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man turned into a golden light and left the place.</p><p>Hmph, kid, someone blocked it for you today, but you won’t get the chance every time. I hope you don’t have to face me in the next arena battle. Qin wuyou’s cold gaze swept toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Qin wuyou, I’m afraid you’ve made a mistake. I promise that this kid won’t dare to fight in the next arena battle!</p><p>Another young man from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sneered.</p><p>there’s no need to use such a low-level goading method. I’ll definitely participate in the next arena battle!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“I hope so!”</p><p>Qin wuyou left this sentence and also left the place. The people of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion also left.</p><p>let’s discuss the candidates for the battle in three months!</p><p>Ice fairy looked at red flame magic pine, mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, Lu Ming, and cangyan Army destroyer.</p><p>“You can discuss the candidates. Just leave me a spot.”</p><p>Lu Ming left with Qiu Yue and the rest and turned to leave.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is he really going to fight? If it wasn’t for the ash-gray flame Army destroyer, he would have already died!”</p><p>it’s for the sake of face, right? being provoked in front of so many people and not accepting the challenge, wouldn’t that be a complete loss of face? ”</p><p>“That’s true, but it’s not wise to risk your life for the sake of face!”</p><p>The surrounding people were all discussing.</p><p>“Hmph, these people have no idea how powerful young master is!”</p><p>After Qiu Yue heard that, she pouted unhappily.</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not mind.</p><p>They left the place and found an Inn to stay in.</p><p>Lu Ming stayed in a guest room alone and sat cross-legged on the bed.</p><p>“Old Liang, it’s been two hundred years. How’s your refinement of the star core’s energy going?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
