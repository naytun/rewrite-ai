It was like a primeval beast that lay on the ground.</p><p>The city walls were so high that they pierced through the clouds. Looking from afar, it was impossible to tell how big this giant city was because the edge of the city walls could not be seen.</p><p>It was as if they could only see one side of the city wall, but not the ends of the wall.</p><p>Star-moon ancient city!</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Bai Li flew forward, and the others followed closely behind.</p><p>As they got closer and closer to the city wall, they realized how huge it was. The wall was ancient and filled with the aura of time. It was as if it had crossed time and space from the beginning of the universe.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the foot of the city wall and found a city gate.</p><p>No, to be precise, there were four doors. Behind the four doors, there was a common passage that led into the city.</p><p>The four doors were all different.</p><p>The door on the far left was the tallest and the most resplendent. It had a noble aura.</p><p>The second door from the left was silver-white and crystal clear. Although it was not as good as the first door, it was still pretty good.</p><p>The third door was an ordinary-looking stone door.</p><p>As for the fourth door, it could no longer be called a door. It was a hole, a hole that could only fit one person.</p><p>you’ve all seen these four gates, right? if you want to enter star-moon ancient city, you must enter through these four gates!</p><p>Bai Li pointed at the four doors.</p><p>“Can’t we just fly in from the top of the city wall?”</p><p>A new member asked.</p><p>“Hehe, if you’re not afraid of death, you can try!”</p><p>An old member sneered.</p><p>The new member’s expression changed immediately.</p><p>there’s a powerful restriction on the city wall. Even if someone above the divine King realm goes up, they’ll die!</p><p>Bai Li said indifferently, and everyone drew in a cold breath.</p><p>Those above the God King realm would also die if they went up. That restriction was too terrifying.</p><p>Then, everyone’s eyes turned to the four doors. Did these four doors have a reason?</p><p>As expected, Bai Li continued his introduction.</p><p>“These four doors also have restrictions. Anyone above the Godking level can’t enter. Only those below the Godking level can!”</p><p>“These four gates, from left to right, are the heaven Gate, earth gate, human gate, and dog gate!”</p><p>Bai Li paused for a moment.</p><p>Heaven sect, earth sect, human sect, dog sect?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes moved. As the name suggested, out of the four gates, the heaven Gate was the most respected and the dog gate was the worst.</p><p>Most of the People’s gazes fell on the heaven Gate.</p><p>If he wanted to leave, he naturally had to go through the heavenly gate.</p><p>However, no one noticed that many of the senior members had complicated expressions on their faces. Some of them even quietly stepped back, indicating that they would go first.</p><p>Bai Li also smiled and said, ” as the name suggests, the heaven Gate is the most honorable, followed by the earth gate. But let me tell you, there is a terrifying restriction on the gate that can test one’s talent. The more talented one is, the more they can pass through the Honorable gate. If one is not talented enough and wants to pass through by force, they will be killed. Do you understand? You have to act within your means!”</p><p>“A fatal disaster!”</p><p>Many of the new members revealed expressions of shock and doubt.</p><p>They looked at the senior members, but most of them stepped back slightly, as if they were asking him to go first.</p><p>“It seems that this door is not easy to pass through!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>If it was easy to leave, the old members would have already left.</p><p>“With my talent, I’ll definitely pass through the heaven Gate!”</p><p>At this time, a young Man in Black stepped out and walked directly toward the sky Gate. His face was full of confidence.</p><p>It was obvious that this person was very confident in his own talent.</p><p>Bai Li’s eyes flickered, but he did not stop him.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the black-clothed youth.</p><p>The difference was that the new members were all curious, while the old members looked like they were watching a good show.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; although the black-clothed youth was confident, he didn’t dare to be careless. He circulated his divine power, and his entire body was covered in divine power.</p><p>Ninth level celestial deity!</p><p>Many people could tell that the black-clothed youth’s cultivation had reached the ninth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>Every step he took was very cautious and he was always on guard.</p><p>Finally, he stepped into the gate of heaven.</p><p>However, there was nothing unusual. There was no reaction from the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>The young man in Black took a few more steps, and nothing unusual happened. The confidence on his face grew even stronger.</p><p>it seems that my talent is enough!</p><p>The young man in Black smiled and continued to walk. However, when he was halfway to the door, he suddenly stopped and stood there motionless.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Why is he not moving?”</p><p>Many people were puzzled.</p><p>“The test has begun!”</p><p>Bai Li said.</p><p>As soon as Bai Li’s voice fell, he saw the black-clothed young man’s body tremble violently. Then, he let out a shrill scream and his body flew out of the Heaven’s Gate. He fell heavily on the ground and remained motionless.</p><p>There was no trace of life in his body!</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>The young man in Black was dead!</p><p>The crowd found a bloody mark between the eyebrows of the young man in Black. This was a fatal wound. His soul had been destroyed.</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>They did not see how the young man in Black had died. What had happened in the Heaven’s Gate?</p><p>let me tell you, the four doors have nothing to do with one’s cultivation level, only one’s talent. If one’s talent is not high enough, they will either die or be injured. You have to think carefully about which door to go through!</p><p>Oh, I forgot to tell you. There won’t be any obstructions to the last door. As long as one’s cultivation level is below the God King realm, they can climb in!</p><p>Bai Li said.</p><p>“It’s impossible to climb in through the dog gate!”</p><p>“With my talent, even if I can’t go through the heaven Gate, I can go through the earth gate.”</p><p>“I’ll go through the earth gate!”</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>Then, a young man stepped out of the earth gate.</p><p>The earth gate was different from the heaven Gate. As soon as this young man stepped into the earth gate, the earth gate began to glow, and then rays of light shot towards this man.</p><p>The man roared and used all his strength to block. However, he only managed to block a few moves before the light pierced through all his defenses and pierced through his body.</p><p>He was torn to pieces and died on the spot.</p><p>Another heaven’s favorite had died. All the new members had ugly expressions.</p><p>One had to know that the talent of the heaven’s favorite just now was definitely not weak. How could the talent of someone who could control divine-grade divine power be weak?</p><p>However, if he couldn’t even pass the Earth’s gate, he would be dead.</p><p>“Even the Earth’s gate is so difficult? Damn it, did you all pass through the human gate before?”</p><p>A new member looked at the old members.</p><p>“He passed through the human gate? Hehe!”</p><p>Some of the older members laughed.</p><p>No way?</p><p>Many people’s hearts turned cold.</p><p>Did he pass through the dog gate?</p><p>A heaven’s favorite who could control divine-grade divine power passed through the dog gate?</p><p>“I don’t believe that I can’t even pass through the human gate!”</p><p>With a furious roar, another young man stepped out. This time, he chose the human gate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
