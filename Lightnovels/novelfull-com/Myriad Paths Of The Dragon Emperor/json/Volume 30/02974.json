QiuQiu, who had not moved for hundreds of years, finally moved.</p><p>He knew that QiuQiu had most likely refined the bronze it had devoured in the ancient God’s world.</p><p>After refining for a few hundred years, what realm could QiuQiu’s cultivation reach?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>At this moment, the bangle that QiuQiu had transformed into glowed and flew out, turning into a round metal ball that emitted powerful fluctuations.</p><p>Qiu Yue was also startled. She came out of the room and looked at QiuQiu curiously.</p><p>“Young master, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Qiu Yue asked.</p><p>“QiuQiu is about to evolve. What a strong fluctuation …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>The radiance emitted from QiuQiu’s body became more and more intense, and the energy fluctuations that permeated the air also became stronger and stronger.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll leave this place first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he waved his hand and kept QiuQiu into a storage ring. He rose into the sky with Qiu Yue and flew out of the Wu family.</p><p>Lu Ming was a guest brought back by the Wu family’s third young master, Wu Zifeng. Naturally, no one stopped him. Lu Ming left the Wu family’s residence smoothly. He sped up and found a remote place with no one around and let QiuQiu out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After QiuQiu was released, it exploded with a huge wave of energy.</p><p>At the same time, boundless divine Qi in the world gathered towards QiuQiu.</p><p>Fortunately, this was the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. The divine Qi here was extremely dense, even denser than low-grade divine crystals. It was endless.</p><p>A large amount of divine Qi was absorbed by QiuQiu, and the aura that QiuQiu emitted rose at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Third level heavenly deity, fourth level heavenly deity, fifth level heavenly deity …</p><p>Very soon, he reached ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were both dumbfounded. They were shocked by the speed of improvement.</p><p>This speed of improvement was even faster than a rocket!</p><p>However, it did not stop when it reached the ninth level celestial deity. It continued to improve.</p><p>In the next moment, the aura QiuQiu emitted skyrocketed once again, breaking through the ninth level celestial deity realm and reaching the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>However, this was still not the limit. He was still improving.</p><p>“Could it be that I can reach the divine King realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and full of anticipation.</p><p>After sleeping for a few hundred years, he was able to break through to the divine King realm from the first level heavenly God Realm in a single day. This speed would probably scare people to death if it was spread out.</p><p>However, QiuQiu had refined that mysterious bronze, so anything was possible.</p><p>QiuQiu’s body glowed with a resplendent bronze luster. Its body seemed to be nurturing a terrifying energy that was trying to break through to the divine King realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of violent rumbles came from QiuQiu’s body.</p><p>After a while …</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely terrifying aura burst out from QiuQiu’s body, and a powerful pressure spread out from QiuQiu’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue could not help but be pushed back by the pressure. They only stopped after they were ten thousand meters away.</p><p>the pressure of a Divine King! QiuQiu has really broken through!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>QiuQiu’s strength was already very shocking. If it broke through to the divine King realm, it was unknown how powerful it would be.</p><p>Now, it was Lu Ming’s first time in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He did not know what kind of crisis he would face. Now that QiuQiu had broken through, it would become a powerful helper for Lu Ming.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The boundless energy between heaven and earth continued to gather towards QiuQiu. Only after a few hours did QiuQiu stop absorbing energy, and its aura also stabilized.</p><p>First level Divine King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming could sense that QiuQiu’s cultivation was at the first level of the divine King realm.</p><p>After it concealed its aura, eyes and a mouth appeared on QiuQiu’s round body. It looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’ve made a breakthrough to the divine King realm. Hahaha!”</p><p>QiuQiu opened its mouth and laughed heartily. It pounced toward Lu Ming and landed on his shoulder.</p><p>“You can speak?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“I can. I’ll be able to do it once I break through to the Godking realm. Unfortunately, I’m only at the first level of the Godking realm …”</p><p>QiuQiu even sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were speechless.</p><p>He had only slept for a few hundred years and he had already reached the divine King realm. If other people knew about this, they would be infuriated to death.</p><p>“Eh, Lu Ming, why are you only at the third level celestial deity realm? How do you cultivate?”</p><p>Then, QiuQiu spoke again, almost causing Lu Ming to suffer internal injuries from anger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyelids twitched a few times. yes, yes, you’re awesome. That’s enough. In the future, if I encounter an opponent I can’t beat, I’ll rely on you!</p><p>don’t worry, leave it to me. I feel like I have an endless amount of power!</p><p>QiuQiu shouted, its round body bouncing around in the air.</p><p>QiuQiu had broken through to the divine King realm. Lu Ming was in a good mood. He took out a large amount of precious metals for QiuQiu to eat.</p><p>After QiuQiu saw these metals, its eyes lit up. It stretched out two tentacles, grabbed them, and stuffed them into its mouth. It looked very happy.</p><p>QiuQiu woke up, and the following days became more lively.</p><p>Soon, the ten days were up!</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue met up and left the Wu family for the universal camp.</p><p>The universal camp was also on this planet, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and was rather far away from the woo family.</p><p>The four of them quickly flew towards the universal camp.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait …”</p><p>Just as they were flying over a mountain range, the Liang character mumbled, looking very anxious.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he immediately shouted, ” “Wait a moment!”</p><p>He pulled Qiu Yue’s hand and stopped.</p><p>“Brother Lu, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had suddenly stopped, Wu Ming and Wu Yue also stopped and looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming did not answer. He did not know what was going on. He was asking about the quantity formula.</p><p>“Old Liang, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I don’t know the details, but I can sense that there’s an abnormality in the energy in the area ahead!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Abnormal energy?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. The energy is abnormal. It’s drawn but not released. It’s very powerful and extremely similar to some kind of great array!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula did not understand formations, but it was extremely sensitive to energy.</p><p>“A great formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>There was actually a large formation in this barren mountain. Could there be some ruins in front?</p><p>Lu Ming’s imagination ran wild.</p><p>“There might be a large formation up ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Wu Yue and Wu Ming.</p><p>“A formation? Could it be some ruins?”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue also thought so.</p><p>I don’t know, but this formation is very powerful. I’m afraid we can’t break it. Let’s note down the location and find an expert to break it in the future. Let’s go around this place first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue nodded. This was a more secure method.</p><p>Then, everyone detoured around this area and advanced in another direction.</p><p>However, they had not flown far when a group of people surrounded Lu Ming and the other three in the middle of the barren mountain below.</p><p>They were a group of people wearing long robes with blood-red edges. They had wooden expressions, but each of them exuded a cold killing intent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
