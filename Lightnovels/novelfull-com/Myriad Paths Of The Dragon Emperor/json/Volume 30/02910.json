How can we break the rising Dragon formation if we don’t sacrifice you to the dark Dragon blood Curse? How can I escape?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, rest in peace. You’ll die a worthy death if you can help me get out of this. Hahaha!”</p><p>The Dragon boat’s master laughed maniacally and sped up his hand seals. The dark Dragon blood Curse on Lu Ming’s body grew wildly like wild grass. Countless small snakes extended out with Lu Ming’s body as the core.</p><p>After these ‘little snakes’ extended out, they intertwined with the rising Dragon array, tightly entangling it. Then, a hole was actually opened in the rising Dragon array.</p><p>A passage appeared where the dark Dragon blood Curse was.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the depths of the rising Dragon array. It was a Dragon’s Roar, and it carried a terrifying pressure, making Lu Ming feel scared.</p><p>a Divine Dragon. A Divine Dragon is trapped in the Coiling Dragon Rising to heaven formation. The true form of this Dragon Boat is a Divine Dragon!</p><p>Bone shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the being that occupied the Dragon boat’s physical body would actually be a Divine Dragon.</p><p>could it be the dark Dragon of the divine Dragons? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Dark Dragons were extremely rare divine Dragons, but they were extremely terrifying existences. Every single one of them had astonishing strength.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>From the depths of the rising Dragon array, the roars of Dragons could be heard continuously, filled with excitement.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m about to break free. In the future, the Qin heaven star region will be my world.”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain laughed and took a step forward, stepping into the passage that had been opened by the rising Dragon formation.</p><p>If the rising Dragon formation had not been activated, no one would be able to Enter the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>Now that the dark Dragon blood Curse had opened up a passage in the rising Dragon array, he could pass through it and help his main body escape.</p><p>Then, he could use the star core to restore his strength to its peak.</p><p>The moment he recovered to his peak state, no one in the Qin heaven star region would be his match.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you are really My Lucky Star!”</p><p>The Dragon boats walked toward Lu Ming and sneered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now is the time …”</p><p>At this moment, bone demon sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m really your Lucky Star?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the Dragon Boat Mountain and sneered. Then, he waved his hand and an array disc flew out of his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had asked Yue Wuya to refine this array disc. Before Lu Ming went to the Darklight Galaxy, Yue Wuya had already refined it and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as the formation disk flew out, it expanded rapidly and hovered above Lu Ming’s head. At the same time, it emitted countless rays of light. These rays of light resonated with the rising Dragon formation.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>At that moment, the dark Dragon blood Curse on Lu Ming’s body exploded continuously as if it was crushed by a force and dispersed.</p><p>At the same time, a steady stream of energy from the ” quantity ” formula gushed into Lu Ming’s body, keeping his divine power at its peak.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain’s eyes were wide open in shock, and his face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>He could not understand why the dark Dragon blood Curse planted on Lu Ming’s body would suddenly explode.</p><p>Naturally, he did not know that Lu Ming had used the array disc that the bone demon had taught him to refine and that he had used the power of the rising Dragon array to destroy it.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, the one to die today is you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. The formation disk above his head emitted a dazzling radiance. Then, with a wave of his hand, the entire Rising Dragon formation trembled. Then, countless rays of light rushed towards the Dragon boats.</p><p>“Ah, what happened? How can you control the rising Dragon array?”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain cried out in disbelief.</p><p>However, in the next moment, the beams of light from the rising Dragon formation struck the bodies of the Dragon boats.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon boats tried their best to resist, and a series of explosions erupted.</p><p>However, the power of the rising Dragon formation was too strong. Even with the Dragon Boat Mountain’s strength, it was difficult to resist it. He was bombarded by beams of light, and the powerful force suppressed the Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain directly knelt on the ground, causing dust and smoke to fill the air.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain let out a beast-like roar. The terrifying divine power of the divine King realm erupted. It was as if a planet was burning. It wanted to break through the suppression of the rising Dragon formation.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The array disc above his head glowed brighter and brighter, completely merging with the rising Dragon array.</p><p>This was the array disc refined by Lu Ming of the bone Devil cult. It was extremely mysterious and could control the rising Dragon array for a short period of time to kill the Dragon boats.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Coiling Dragon Rising to the heaven formation started to shake as if it had a mind of its own. Rays of light seemed to have turned into chains that wrapped around the Dragon boats.</p><p>Although the Dragon Boat Mountain tried its best to resist, it was still useless. Its body was tightly bound by the light beam chains formed by the rising Dragon array.</p><p>These chains of light had terrifying suppression and obliterating effects. Once they wrapped around the target, they would kill the target.</p><p>“Ah, damn it …”</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain roared as it struggled. It was simply in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually control the rising Dragon array. This was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>He had studied it for countless years but could not find a way to control the rising Dragon formation. If he had known this method, why would he need Lu Ming’s help to refine the dark Dragon blood Curse? he would have released his original body a long time ago.</p><p>Lu Ming, a young junior disciple, actually knew the method to control the rising Dragon array?</p><p>But now, he didn’t have time to think too much. How to escape was the top priority.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? How dare you offend your superior, why aren’t you letting me go?”</p><p>Dragon boats roared in anger and put on the airs of the sect leader of Kong Xuan sect to pressure Lu Ming.</p><p>“What a joke. You want my life, and I don’t dare to resist? Is there something wrong with your brain?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in disdain and continued, moreover, you’re not the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect, Long Zhou’s Mountain. The soul of the real Dragon Zhou’s Mountain has long been destroyed by you. You’re the dark Dragon inside, right? ”</p><p>“You … How do you know?”</p><p>This time, Dragon Boat Mountain was even more shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could even guess this. He was simply a monster.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m not Dragon Boat Mountain, I’m dark Dragon. Lu Ming, do you know how strong I am? Once I escape, I can suppress the Qin heaven star system with a flip of my hand. Now, let me go quickly and I can swear that I won’t harm your life. I can even give you a great fortune.”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain roared.</p><p>Seeing that threatening them wouldn’t work, Dragon Boat Mountain immediately changed their strategy and changed to baiting and roping them in.</p><p>“Great fortune? I don’t care. I’ll only be at ease after I get rid of you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and continued to control the rising Dragon formation to kill the Dragon boats.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out from Dragon boat’s body. Those were caused by his divine power being crushed by the power of the trapping Dragon Rising to heaven formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
