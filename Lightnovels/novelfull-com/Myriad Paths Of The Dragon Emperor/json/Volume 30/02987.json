As for how many low-grade divine crystals it was equivalent to, it was an astronomical figure.</p><p>Upon hearing this number, Lu Ming was also shocked.</p><p>The old man also looked at Lu Ming with a smile.</p><p>Even a low-level Divine King would not be able to afford such a price. He was certain that Lu Ming would not be able to afford so many divine crystals.</p><p>sigh, what a pity. I can’t directly buy the first level!</p><p>Lu Ming also sighed in his heart.</p><p>In fact, he only needed to buy the first level of these divine techniques. However, there was a rule here that if he wanted to buy, he could only buy the whole book.</p><p>After sighing, Lu Ming took out a few storage rings and fiddled with them. Then, he handed one to the old man.</p><p>“Senior, the low grade, mid grade, and high grade divine crystals in here are exactly the same as a hundred thousand high grade divine crystals!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You … Do you really have that many divine crystals?”</p><p>The old man was skeptical. He took Lu Ming’s storage ring and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He was stunned.</p><p>The space in the storage ring was filled with divine crystals.</p><p>There was a mountain of low grade and middle grade divine crystals, as well as a portion of high grade divine crystals.</p><p>An ordinary person would not be able to count them, but with the elder’s powerful spiritual sense, he was able to count them in a few breaths. The divine crystals added together were exactly the same as 100000 high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>“Kid, you’re amazing. You really can take out a hundred thousand high grade divine crystals!”</p><p>The old man also sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart. If he had not killed the night Demon Lord and obtained his storage ring, he would not have been able to take out so many divine crystals.</p><p>One had to know that the night Demon King owned the demon night spring, which was why he had so many divine crystals.</p><p>Even so, after paying such a large sum of divine crystals, Lu Ming did not have many divine crystals left.</p><p>since you’ve paid the divine crystals, these divine techniques are yours. I’ll remove the restrictions on them for you!</p><p>The old man said. Then, he formed a seal with both hands. Runes flew into the secret manual one after another. The light on the secret manual flickered a few times before it stabilized.</p><p>“Alright, the restriction on it has been broken. Take it!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and took the secret manual. He kept it in his storage ring and returned to his residence impatiently.</p><p>“Qiuyue …”</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming walked into Qiu Yue’s room.</p><p>“Young master, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Qiu Yue ended her cultivation and blinked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiuyue, how’s your cultivation going with the Saint-grade divine arts I gave you before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“They’ve all been successfully cultivated. They’ve already condensed divine fire.”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“So fast …”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless.</p><p>Fortunately, Qiu Yue cultivated the same divine technique as Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiuyue, I’ve bought some divine-grade divine skills and techniques. Take two of them and cultivate them. After you’ve cultivated them, merge the divine-grade divine power with similar attributes into the divine-grade divine power!</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few divine-grade techniques and passed them to Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Divine-grade Divine Art!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes lit up and she took the two.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to his room and took out a divine technique, the ‘divine Taiyin technique’, and started to flip through it.</p><p>It was indeed difficult to cultivate a divine-grade mystical technique. However, Lu Ming already had a lot of experience. In addition, his comprehension had improved a lot on Star Peak. It was not too difficult to cultivate it.</p><p>A few months later, Lu Ming had cultivated the first stage of the Taiyin divine technique and successfully cultivated a wisp of Taiyin divine energy. After that, Lu Ming switched to cultivating the universe thousand Dao Scripture and continued to strengthen this wisp of Taiyin divine energy until he cultivated a divine fire.</p><p>Just like that, a year passed. When the divine energy was strong enough, another divine fire was ignited in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>This was the divine fire of Taiyin.</p><p>This was also because the cultivation environment in the star sky Camp was too good. If it were anywhere else, it wouldn’t be as fast.</p><p>“Now, I can merge the ice divine power and the extreme cold divine power into the moon divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He began to control the two divine flames and fused them with the divine Moon Fire.</p><p>Their attributes were similar, and the level of the divine Moon Fire was higher, so it was relatively easy to merge them. After a few months, the ice divine power and the ultimate cold divine power had completely merged into the divine Moon Fire.</p><p>The divine Moon Fire had grown a lot stronger, but it was still far from the divine fire condensed by the ruler’s divine power and the inextinguishable sword force. It would take time for it to grow.</p><p>In this way, there were only nine divine flames left in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>I wonder how Qiu Yue’s cultivation is going. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the room and happened to see Qiu Yue in the courtyard, cultivating a divine skill.</p><p>Qiu Yue stopped cultivating when she noticed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiuyue, how’s your cultivation of the two divine-grade divine arts?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with a smile.</p><p>I finished cultivating a few months ago!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“What? you’ve finished cultivating? Has the divine flame fusion been completed?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s done!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>Lu Ming had suffered a huge blow.</p><p>He had been cultivating non-stop and had only managed to cultivate one of them. However, Qiu Yue had already cultivated two of them. This was really a blow to him.</p><p>“Qiuyue, take these and cultivate!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave the remaining three divine techniques to Qiu Yue, and Qiu Yue returned the two that she had finished cultivating.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while before returning to their respective rooms to continue cultivating.</p><p>Time passed quickly. It had been ten years since Lu Ming came to the space Camp.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated all the divine-grade divine skills and wondrous techniques. He had completely fused all the divine powers with similar attributes.</p><p>Now, there were only nine divine fires and nine types of divine power left in Lu Ming’s dantian.</p><p>Seven of them were divine-grade divine power.</p><p>They were the ruler divine power, inextinguishable sword power, sun divine power, moon divine power, sky profound divine power, annihilating wind divine power, and sky evil divine power.</p><p>There was also a sacred grade divine power, the multi-eye divine power, and a King grade divine power, the Golden Dragon divine power.</p><p>Of course, out of the seven types of divine-grade divine power, only the ruler’s divine power and inextinguishable sword force were in a full state. They were at the fourth-level celestial deity realm.</p><p>The other five divine-grade divine powers were only at the level of a first-level celestial deity. They were still far from full.</p><p>Although the sacred and King grade divine powers were full before the fusion, they were far from full once they were converted to divine grade divine power.</p><p>However, even so, Lu Ming’s overall combat strength had improved.</p><p>After all, they were all divine-grade divine powers. Each of them was extremely powerful.</p><p>If all his divine energy was full, Lu Ming’s combat strength would increase dramatically. By then, even if his cultivation did not improve, he would be able to crush a heaven’s favorite like Leng Ying.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, it was also very difficult to cultivate five types of divine-grade divine power to a full state.</p><p>For example, a person would need a long time to advance from the first level to the fourth level celestial deity. Moreover, Lu Ming was equivalent to five people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
