With a loud shout, his body swelled rapidly and he turned into an ancient God.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, the ancient God Body he had transformed into had orange scales.</p><p>His orange-armored ancient God Body and height were much shorter than Lu Ming’s. However, mo jiuye’s cultivation was too high. He was a sixth-level celestial deity, much stronger than Lu Ming. With the support of his powerful cultivation, his power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Mo jiuye took a step forward and his huge body rushed towards Lu Ming. A huge black demonic blade appeared in his hand and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed towards mo jiuye.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them fought intensely and launched fierce attacks.</p><p>This was the most direct collision, and it was extremely intense.</p><p>It was like two giants were suddenly fighting each other. During this period, the two of them used all kinds of means.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously cast the ice chain, the divine Dragon materialization technique, and the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>Mo jiuye also used all sorts of terrifying secret skills and divine skills.</p><p>One had to admit that mo jiuye’s combat strength was extremely strong. The two of them fought for hundreds of moves, but it was still difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>The divine power that mo jiuye controlled was divine-grade divine power. Furthermore, the divine skills and secret skills that he cultivated were also very powerful and were not any weaker than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Moreover, his cultivation was five levels higher than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>This was the fifth level of the celestial deity realm. The gap was truly shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s advantage was the universe thousand Dao mantra. He had cultivated six divine flames and his body was filled with six types of divine power.</p><p>However, other than the ruler’s divine power, two of Lu Ming’s other five types of divine power were divine grade divine power while the other three were King grade divine power.</p><p>The difference between the sacred grade divine power and the king grade divine power was too great. Even if there were five types combined, the difference would not be too great.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that his current level of divine power was barely comparable to mo jiuye, who was a third-level celestial God, or even worse.</p><p>Lu Ming’s other advantage was that his battle formula had quadrupled combat power and his green-armored ancient God Body.</p><p>With all these advantages combined, he would be able to fight against mo jiuye in terms of combat power.</p><p>The two of them were evenly matched, and in the blink of an eye, hundreds of moves had been exchanged.</p><p>terrifying. Why is Lu Ming so terrifying? ”</p><p>this is heaven-defying! I’ve never even heard of his name before. I can’t believe he’s this strong. The Kong Xuan sect actually has such a genius. The heavens are going to change in the future.</p><p>The other geniuses of the three Overlord forces couldn’t calm down.</p><p>Even sword Dao Wu Ji and cangyan po Jun’s faces were very serious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>This was especially so for Wu Ji, whose body was constantly emitting the sound of a sword. He was like a divine sword, and his sword intent soared to the sky, ready to attack at any time.</p><p>However, he still held back.</p><p>After all, he was a Divine Son. If he attacked Lu Ming together with mo jiuye, he would lose face.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and Mo jiuye’s battle continued, and the more they fought, the more tragic it became.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Mo jiuye’s Saber Light landed on Lu Ming’s body. The green scales flew in the air and deep wounds appeared on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, at the same time, Lu Ming’s long spear also struck mo jiuye’s body. Mo jiuye staggered and a large piece of his body exploded. Blood and flesh flew everywhere. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>However, the two of them had no intention of stopping. They were still fighting fiercely, and their fighting spirit was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>The others held their breaths and watched with widened eyes. They wanted to see who would win between Lu Ming and Mo jiuye.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming brandished his long spear like a dragon. He performed the first and second forms of the three apocalyptic strikes in succession.</p><p>This was also due to the support of the quantity formula, where Shen power was endless. Otherwise, it would have been very difficult to support.</p><p>It was only with so many conditions that Lu Ming was able to unleash such powerful combat abilities. Otherwise, it was impossible for a first-level celestial deity to have such combat abilities.</p><p>Although mo jiuye was only a sixth-level celestial deity, his combat strength was enough to kill an ordinary eighth-level celestial deity. He could even fight a ninth-level celestial deity.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming was only at the first level celestial deity realm, but he could fight a ninth level celestial deity. This was simply a miracle.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, three apocalyptic strikes …”</p><p>Since the start of the war, Lu Ming’s mind was unusually calm. He was enjoying the war and absorbing experience from it.</p><p>His understanding of the three apocalyptic strikes was getting deeper and deeper. He had a feeling that the three apocalyptic strikes were about to break through.</p><p>He had been cultivating the three apocalyptic strikes to the peak of the sixth stage for a long time. After such a long period of tempering, his understanding of the three apocalyptic strikes had become very deep.</p><p>After the intense battle with mo jiuye, he really had a feeling that he was about to break through.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming brandished his long spear. The long spear vibrated and a crescent-shaped spearlight slashed out. Its power was much stronger than before.</p><p>He had broken through!</p><p>At this moment, the three apocalyptic strikes had broken through to the seventh level.</p><p>Every time a divine skill was broken through, its power would increase greatly.</p><p>The crescent-shaped spear radiance clashed with mo jiuye’s saber radiance, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s expression changed drastically, revealing a look of disbelief.</p><p>At this critical moment, how could Lu Ming’s attack power increase again?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mo jiuye’s body trembled and he took a few steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“Hahaha, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He kept brandishing his long spear. The breakthrough of the three apocalyptic strikes had made it easier for him to cast them.</p><p>Moreover, he had broken through to the seventh stage of the three apocalyptic strikes and could already cast the third move. Of course, it would take time to cultivate. Lu Ming had not cultivated and naturally could not cast it.</p><p>However, the power of the first move, sky-piercing, and the second move, moon-cutting, had also been greatly improved.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The situation had completely changed. Lu Ming’s attack power had suddenly increased and he had completely suppressed mo jiuye.</p><p>Mo jiuye bellowed continuously and tried his best, but he was still no match for Lu Ming. He was forced to retreat and for a moment, he could only defend himself but not fight back.</p><p>Originally, his combat strength was on par with Lu Ming’s. Now that Lu Ming’s divine skill had a breakthrough, the balance was tilted.</p><p>this Lu Ming has such a terrifying talent. He actually managed to break through to the divine skill in the middle of a great battle.</p><p>Boundless sword Dao’s eyes flashed with a hint of shock.</p><p>“Of course, such talent is shocking!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun licked his lips, his eyes filled with shock and battle intent.</p><p>They were also peerless geniuses. However, it was their first time meeting someone like Lu Ming.</p><p>such a person can not be left alive. Otherwise, there will be no place for us in the Qin heaven star region in the future!</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji’s eyes flashed with a shocking cold light.</p><p>“Boundless sword Dao, do you want to join forces with mo jiuye? I can’t do such a thing. If we want to fight, we have to fight fair and square!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun said disdainfully.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
