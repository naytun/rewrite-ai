The crescent-shaped spear radiance shook violently and then shattered. A powerful force rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he retreated rapidly. The qi and blood in his body churned, and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The divine power of a half-step Divine King was already extremely dense. In addition to the sixty to seventy percent of the divine power that had been awakened, the power was too shocking. Lu Ming, who had gathered the power of seven types of divine-grade divine power, could not withstand it.</p><p>However, the youth from the Qin family was even more shocked.</p><p>“What’s going on with this kid? A fourth level celestial deity being so strong, simply monstrous!”</p><p>“And his Shen power feels impure, but why is it so powerful?”</p><p>The Qin clan’s young man had many thoughts in his mind. He was extremely puzzled.</p><p>He could clearly feel that Lu Ming’s divine power was mixed and impure. It seemed to be caused by an unstable foundation. However, its power was shockingly strong.</p><p>A fourth level heavenly deity who had not awakened the origin divine power factor yet was about to be able to contend with his divine power.</p><p>He had also thought that Lu Ming’s divine power was not mixed and impure. Instead, it contained seven different types of divine power.</p><p>After exchanging a move, Lu Ming turned around and continued to fly.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The two young men from the Qin clan continued to chase after him.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed a mountain peak in front of him. There were a few young men on the peak who seemed to be resting.</p><p>“That is … The Wu clan’s prodigy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The few youths on the mountain peak were clearly the Wu family’s prodigies. Lu Ming saw Wu Ming and Wu Yue among them.</p><p>At that moment, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest also saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“This ancient God Body … It’s brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>that’s the Qin family. Damn it! Brothers, attack!</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue immediately recognized Lu Ming. They also noticed the Qin family’s prodigy. They did not need to think to know what was going on. They immediately roared.</p><p>“Leave it to us!”</p><p>On the mountain peak, two of the woo family’s heaven’s favorites flew into the air and charged towards the Qin family’s heaven’s favorites like two shooting stars.</p><p>two half-step divine kings joining hands to deal with a fourth level heavenly deity. Your Qin family is really shameless. Let us be your opponents!</p><p>A young man from the Wu family sneered. He slashed out with his sword from a distance.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A ray of sword light crossed thousands of miles and slashed at a Qin family Youth.</p><p>The sword light was bright and its power was overbearing. The youth from the Qin family had no choice but to stop and block.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He punched out and blocked the sword light. His body also stopped.</p><p>At the same time, the other genius of the Wu family also made his move and blocked the other young man from the Qin family.</p><p>The two Qin clan’s elites were both blocked.</p><p>“This is a matter of my Qin clan. This man killed our Qin clan’s genius. Is your Wu clan trying to meddle in our business?”</p><p>A young man from the Qin clan said coldly.</p><p>“So what if I’m a busybody? Lu Ming is a friend of the Wu family. If you want to kill him, it’s the same as killing a member of the Wu family!”</p><p>One of the geniuses from the woo family chuckled.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the Wu family’s strength was not any weaker than the Qin family, so there was no need to fear the Qin family.</p><p>“You guys …”</p><p>The two young men from the Qin clan had unsightly expressions.</p><p>The two geniuses from the woo family were no weaker than him. One of them had even stepped through the earth gate. His talent was shocking, and his combat strength was above theirs.</p><p>They knew that with the Wu family’s help, they would not be able to kill Lu Ming today.</p><p>Hmph, kid, you’re lucky. I hope you can keep going this far. The next time we meet will be the day of your death!</p><p>One of the Qin family’s young men looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say to you. The next time we meet will be the day you die!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded indifferently.</p><p>He would remember the enmity of being hunted down today.</p><p>“Hehe, just you?”</p><p>A young man from the Qin family laughed disdainfully before turning around and leaving.</p><p>Very quickly, the two youths from the Qin clan disappeared.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you alright?”</p><p>Wu Yue and Wu Ming flew over.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed like an ordinary person and said, I’m fine. Thank you for saving me this time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to escape!</p><p>If he had not encountered the woo family’s heaven’s pride expert this time, he would have had to risk his life.</p><p>The only way for him to go all out was to burn his ancient God heart. After burning his ancient God heart, he would definitely be able to kill the two Qin clan geniuses.</p><p>However, the losses would be too great. It was not worth burning the ancient God heart for two Qin family members.</p><p>brother Lu, you’re too polite. Since we’re friends, we can’t just sit by and do nothing!</p><p>One of the woo family’s elites laughed.</p><p>The other two heaven’s pride experts were Wu zixiong and Wu Xu. Both of them were at the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>Among them, Wu zixiong’s talent was even stronger. He had already awakened ninety percent of his divine power and was not far from completely awakening the origin divine power factor. He had already passed through the Earth’s gate before.</p><p>Of course, it seemed like there was not much difference between 90% and completely awakening the origin divine power factor. However, it was shockingly difficult to achieve.</p><p>90% of the people would be stuck, and it would be difficult for them to achieve the final breakthrough.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>There were no words to thank him for his great kindness. He just had to remember it in his heart.</p><p>Wait, something was wrong!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly thought of a problem.</p><p>“Brothers woo, how did you all get together? did you all just happen to be teleported here together?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>no, we were separated when we were teleported here. We only gathered together after communicating with each other through the Jade talisman!</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>“Jade voice transmission talisman? Could it be that the Jade voice transmission talisman can be used here?”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly.</p><p>“Of course it can be used. Why? Brother Lu, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Wu Ming asked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and a look of worry flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Not long after he entered, he sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue. However, the voice transmission jade talisman could not be used. He thought that the voice transmission jade talisman could not be used here.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue. However, the result was that he still could not send a voice transmission.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank and his expression turned uglier.</p><p>“Brother Lu, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Wu Ming and the others also noticed that something was amiss and asked.</p><p>why can’t my voice transmission jade talisman be transmitted out …</p><p>Lu Ming told her about him sending a voice transmission to Qiu Yue.</p><p>“It can’t be spread? Brother Lu, pass it on to me!”</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly sent a voice transmission to Wu Ming. However, it was unimpeded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned even uglier. Could it be that something had really happened to Qiu Yue?</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>brother Lu, you don’t have to worry. In star-moon ancient city, voice transmission is indeed suppressed. If the distance is too far, it’s normal that the voice can’t be transmitted out!</p><p>furthermore, if lady Qiuyue is in some isolated place, it’s possible that she can’t get out!</p><p>Wu zixiong consoled Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
