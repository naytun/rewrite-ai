Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the city Lord of the devil-general city finished speaking, figures appeared from all directions.</p><p>General fiend guards, more than three thousand general fiend guards, surrounded the area in all directions.</p><p>In addition, there was a pattern to where these general fiend guards were standing. Over three thousand general fiend guards had set up a large formation.</p><p>The city Lord of the general Demon City was well-prepared and had no intention of letting Lu Ming leave.</p><p>“Where are my friends?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. His killing intent was already at its peak.</p><p>hehe, it’s fine if I tell you. Your friend was taken away by the people of Shanghai. Furthermore, I was the one who informed the people of Shanghai to come.</p><p>The general Devil City Lord sneered.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed his anger and asked. He needed more information to save Qiu Yue and the rest.</p><p>“Why? Hahaha, let me tell you, the night Demon King of demonic city has placed a demonic soul curse on every city Lord of a satellite city. This curse is constantly torturing me, and only those who have made great contributions can remove this curse, do you understand?”</p><p>and your friends are all very talented. If you give them to Shanghai, they will be the best materials to become demon slaves. Haha!</p><p>The general Devil City Lord roared and laughed like a madman.</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. He had offered the city Lord of the demonic city, Qiu Yue, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong, to the demonic city in order to remove the demonic soul curse on his body.</p><p>“I helped you take back the spirit Lake, and you’re using this method to repay me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“If you don’t do it for yourself, the heavens will destroy you. I’ll be free by sacrificing you. As long as I capture you and offer you to the Demon King, he will definitely remove my Demon Soul curse seal, hahaha!”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord laughed, his face full of anticipation, as if he could already see the moment he was removed from the devil soul curse.</p><p>“You … You should die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his voice icy.</p><p>At this moment, his killing intent toward the city Lord of general Devil City was extremely strong.</p><p>He really didn’t expect that the general Devil city’s city Lord would be so despicable.</p><p>No wonder he had suggested for Qiu Yue and the others to stay here. He had planned everything.</p><p>He did not even want to let Lu Ming off.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you do have some ability. However, I’ve already made preparations and set up The Fiend guard formation. With the combined power of 3600 general fiend guards, it’s more than enough to suppress you!”</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A total of 3600 general fiend guards roared. Their divine power gathered in a strange way and formed a huge hand that slammed down on Lu Ming, trying to suppress him.</p><p>The power of this palm had at least reached ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming charged up and activated the battle character formula that increased his combat power by four times. A ray of spear radiance pierced through the air and collided with the huge palm print.</p><p>The palm print shook violently and then shattered.</p><p>However, this was only the first wave of the enemy’s attack.</p><p>Then, palm prints were formed one after another, pressing down on Lu Ming continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming kept casting the sky-piercing move. The Spear’s gleam soared into the sky and destroyed the palm prints.</p><p>For a time, the two sides were in a stalemate.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord was shocked.</p><p>With the power that the great fiend guard array was releasing now, even an ordinary ninth-level celestial deity would be suppressed. However, Lu Ming was not suppressed.</p><p>This level of combat strength truly shocked him.</p><p>“Activate The Fiend guard formation’s second attack!”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord shouted.</p><p>Instantly, the 3600 general demon guards started to move. They moved in a strange pattern and gathered the divine Qi in the heaven and earth into the array, increasing the power of the array.</p><p>Instantly, Lu Ming was at a disadvantage and the Spear’s gleam was suppressed.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, no matter how strong you are, you will be suppressed by me!”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord laughed out loud, extremely excited.</p><p>The stronger Lu Ming was, the more attention he would receive after he was offered to the night Demon Lord. The more likely the demonic soul curse on him would be removed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The general Demon city’s City Master stepped forward and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Runes appeared on his body, forming many runes.</p><p>These were the devil soul curses.</p><p>Although the devil soul curse seal was constantly tormenting him, it could also increase his combat power for a short time once he used it.</p><p>He activated the devil soul curse mark, and the curse mark roared like a devil.</p><p>At this moment, the general Devil city’s city Lord’s strength had risen to ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Together with The Fiend guard formation, he struck out a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>“All of you will die!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth.</p><p>After he came to Magic City mountain, he had not revealed all his trump cards so that he could use them at the crucial moment.</p><p>But now, he had no choice but to use it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A roar came from Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the roar of an ancient God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body grew rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>The main hall of the city Lord’s mansion crumbled in Lu Ming’s huge body, sending gravel flying everywhere.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>The ancient God Body that was hundreds of meters tall stood above the city Lord’s mansion. It was hard not to attract attention.</p><p>Many people in the general Demon City looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; after transforming into a young ancient God, Lu Ming’s strength surged, and he swept out with his massive spear.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All the attacks that were aimed at Lu Ming from all directions exploded and turned into rolling Qi that was swept back by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>At least a few hundred general fiend guards screamed as their bodies exploded and died on the spot.</p><p>The city Lord of general Devil City groaned as he was hit by the spear radiance. He retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is this possible?”</p><p>Looking at the ancient God Body that was hundreds of meters tall, the general Devil City Master shouted in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming actually had such a trump card. He was so powerful. Was he still human?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and cast the moon splitting technique. He swept his long spear horizontally and the crescent-shaped Spear’s gleam covered half of the area.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>The Fiend guard formation could not even withstand a single blow and was immediately broken.</p><p>In this direction, there were at least a thousand general fiend guards who had died under the spear radiance without even being able to let out a scream.</p><p>“Monster, monster …”</p><p>The city Lord of the general Devil City trembled violently, and his face was filled with fear.</p><p>Yan Zhi was even more miserable. He was drenched in cold sweat. He looked at Lu Ming, who was like a god of War, and he almost peed his pants.</p><p>“Go, go!”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord reacted and was about to escape with Yan Zhi.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not let him escape.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and pressed his long spear down. Like a mountain range, it pressed down on the general Demon city’s City Master.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The spear radiance was thousands of miles long. As it pressed down, the entire city Lord’s mansion exploded and was razed to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
