He had the strength, but he couldn’t use it.</p><p>The dark night Demon King crazily activated his star core, but the three secret treasures emitted strange fluctuations and confined his star core. He tried his best, but he could only exert 50 – 60% of its power.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A sword light slashed at night Demon King’s neck. He dodged quickly, but it still left a sword wound on his cheek.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it.”</p><p>&Nbsp; the night Demon King roared. He had been continuously injured and had gone crazy. His eyes were filled with savagery.</p><p>if you want me to die, then we’ll die together. It’s worth it to drag you heaven’s pride experts down with me!</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   the night Demon King roared, and his aura suddenly became violent. Then, a ball of light shot out from his dantian.</p><p>This ball of light was dazzling and the Starlight was resplendent. Then, a crystal the size of a Dragon’s Eye appeared.</p><p>As soon as the crystal appeared, it emitted a terrifying fluctuation!</p><p>“It’s a star core!”</p><p>A young man exclaimed.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He could recognize that the crystal was the star core. It was the star core condensed by the night Demon Lord when he broke through to the divine King realm. It was different from the star core that Lu Ming had.</p><p>The star core that Lu Ming had obtained was many times stronger than this one in terms of size, mass, and energy fluctuations.</p><p>Although it couldn’t be compared to a star core, the fluctuations emitted by this star core were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as the star core appeared, it began to shake slightly. Then, a terrifying energy fluctuation spread out from the star core, as if it was going to break through the suppression of the three secret treasures.</p><p>“Not good! He’s going to self-destruct his star core!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>A few of the young heaven’s favorites looked terrified as they retreated frantically.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the night Demon King roared with a malevolent expression. After his roar, the star core cracked and split into two.</p><p>Half of it flew into the night Demon King’s dantian, while the other half exploded with a boom.</p><p>The night Demon King didn’t really want to completely self-destruct his star core. He actually split it into half, only half. This way, he could at least preserve some of his cultivation.</p><p>The self-destruction of a star core, even if it was only half of it, would still be terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>It was as if a planet had exploded. A mushroom cloud rose, and the terrifying energy spread in all directions.</p><p>The first to bear the brunt were the three secret treasures.</p><p>&Nbsp; Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>The three secret treasures started to shake violently. Then, cracks appeared on them. Following that, more and more cracks appeared before they exploded.</p><p>The three secret treasures exploded one after another, and the fluctuations disappeared.</p><p>The remaining energy made the heaven’s favorites spit out blood.</p><p>Fortunately, they had reacted early and retreated early. Furthermore, the night Demon King had only self-destructed half of his star core. Although they were injured, they were not seriously injured.</p><p>The night Demon Lord himself also vomited blood.</p><p>He had self-destructed half of his star core, and he had also suffered heavy injuries, greatly damaging his vitality.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the night Demon King couldn’t care about his injuries anymore. He ran for his life and randomly chose a direction.</p><p>This direction happened to be where Lu Ming was hiding.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites let out a sigh of relief and started to chase after the night Demon King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The night Demon Lord was very fast. Very soon, he was not far from Lu Ming.</p><p>“He really delivered himself to my door!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and took out a long spear. With a flick of his hand, the long spear flew out like lightning and headed straight for the face of the night Demon Lord.</p><p>The night Demon King was shocked and waved his hand to slap the spear away, but he also stopped.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had already rushed out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and charged toward the night Demon Lord. As he rushed out, his body swelled rapidly and he turned into a green-armored ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>Before he even arrived, the nine ice chains had already rushed out.</p><p>“It’s you, Lu Ming. Get lost!”</p><p>When the night Demon Lord saw Lu Ming, he roared and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The palm force that could topple mountains and overturn the seas broke the nine ice chains.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s follow-up attack had arrived.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear with both hands and struck down. The huge Spear’s gleam pressed down on the night Demon Lord.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance collided with the night Demon King’s attack. The night Demon King’s body trembled, and his palm almost exploded. Blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>The night Demon Lord had self-destructed half of his star core and suffered a great loss of vitality. He had less than 10% of his strength left.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, after he reached the fourth-level celestial deity realm, his combat strength had already completely surpassed the current Night Demon Lord.</p><p>As soon as the two of them exchanged blows, Night Demon King was severely injured.</p><p>die! Starburst!</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to use his strongest move.</p><p>A spear light suddenly burst out and stabbed toward Night Demon King.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   Night Demon King roared and used all his strength to block, but the spear light exploded like a star core.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” arghh!   the night Demon King screamed as it was blown to pieces by this energy. Only a bit of its soul was left, and it wanted to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming grabbed with his hand and a nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out. It opened its mouth wide and swallowed the night Demon Lord’s soul into the air.</p><p>arghh! with a shrill and unwilling scream, the night Demon King’s soul was completely destroyed.</p><p>The Demon King of a generation was dead!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming waved his hand and kept the night Demon Lord’s storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had just put away the storage ring when Wu Xue’s senior brother, the young man who was covered in golden light, and the others arrived and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>The witch’s blood roared ferociously.</p><p>“It was me!” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>kid, hand over the night Demon King’s storage ring and I’ll give you a quick death!</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother, the blood-robed young man, said coldly. He did not conceal the killing intent on his body at all.</p><p>“Give me a quick death? Just you?”</p><p>Lu Ming was disdainful.</p><p>Hmph, kid, don’t think that you’re so great just because you won first place in the great battle in Shanghai. At that time, it was inconvenient for us to participate in the battle to avoid alerting the enemy. Otherwise, Who Do You Think You Are? ”</p><p>The blood-robed young man sneered. He suddenly took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming. A huge blood-red palm grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and swept his long spear out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The blood-colored palm collapsed, and the blood-robed young man retreated.</p><p>“You … Your strength?”</p><p>The blood-robed young man looked at Lu Ming in shock. He was no match for Lu Ming at all.</p><p>Back then, although Lu Ming was powerful and could defeat Pei Lin, he still thought that he could defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s strength had completely surpassed his.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
