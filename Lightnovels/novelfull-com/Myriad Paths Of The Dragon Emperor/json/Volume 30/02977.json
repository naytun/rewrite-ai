It charged forward like an electric net.</p><p>The three men in blood-red robes were swept away, and their bodies turned into ashes.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming brandished his long spear and shot out thousands of spearlights at the people in blood-red robes who were trying to escape, blocking their path.</p><p>Then, QiuQiu arrived and killed a few more people.</p><p>At this moment, Wu Ming and Wu Yue were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>This battle situation had turned around too quickly.</p><p>Initially, they had lost all hope. The enemy had sent twelve half-step divine kings and two divine kings. With such a lineup, they were sure that they would die.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would suddenly throw out a metal ball that was so powerful. In just a few moves, he had finished off the two opposing divine kings.</p><p>“A Divine King metallic lifeform!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue muttered, their hearts still unable to calm down.</p><p>“QiuQiu, leave him alive!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>QiuQiu responded. Its two tentacles turned into two huge hammers and rushed to the head of a man in a long robe with blood-red edges. The Hammers smashed down.</p><p>Although the man in the blood-red robe tried his best to resist, how could he resist QiuQiu’s power with his strength? even divine kings of the same level couldn’t resist QiuQiu’s attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The man in the blood-red robe was smashed to the ground like a meteorite, crushing a mountain. A huge pit appeared on the ground, and the man was lying in the pit, twitching and spitting out blood. He was half-dead and could not move.</p><p>Then, QiuQiu charged at another man in a long robe with blood-colored edges.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s obstruction and QiuQiu’s astonishing speed, the people in the long robes could not escape at all.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>One by one, QiuQiu hammered the remaining six men in blood-red robes to the ground. They were all embedded in the ground, half-dead.</p><p>Twelve half-step divine kings and two divine kings, done.</p><p>“How is it? Lu Ming, I’m amazing, right?!”</p><p>QiuQiu’s body shrunk and it flew in front of Lu Ming, looking like it was asking for credit.</p><p>amazing, amazing, absolutely amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming was in awe. He was really in awe. QiuQiu’s combat strength was becoming more and more amazing.</p><p>Those who could reach the divine King realm were all heaven’s favorites with great strength.</p><p>However, the two divine kings of the other side were completely suppressed by QiuQiu and were unable to retaliate at all.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that QiuQiu’s strength was definitely able to contend with an ordinary second-stage Divine King. If it were to go all out, it might be able to compete with a third-stage Divine King.</p><p>It should be known that it was much more difficult to fight above one’s realm at the king God Realm than at the heavenly God Realm, true God Realm, and ethereal God Realm.</p><p>Many people who were able to fight against those at a higher level than them were unable to do so once they reached the Godking realm.</p><p>After chatting with QiuQiu for a while, Lu Ming’s body transformed into the size of a normal person. He took a step forward and landed beside a man in a long robe with blood-red edges.</p><p>“Tell me, who sent you? if you tell me, I can spare your life!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“If you want to kill me, then kill me. Don’t even think about getting a single word out of me!”</p><p>The other party said coldly.</p><p>“You’re not afraid of death?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was even colder.</p><p>“If you want to kill, then kill!”</p><p>The other party was expressionless and showed no fear.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming was very straightforward. With a flick of his finger, a ray of spear light burst out and pierced the person’s glabella, killing him.</p><p>Then, in a flash, he appeared beside the next man in the blood-red robe.</p><p>“Speak, who sent you?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>The man had seen everything that had happened, but there was no fear in his eyes. He said with a wooden expression, ” “If you want to kill me, then kill me. Don’t even think about getting a single word out of my mouth!”</p><p>The answer was exactly the same as the previous person.</p><p>“Do you think I can’t do anything if you don’t answer?”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. Divine energy gushed out and he controlled the person. Then, he cast a soul-searching technique to find the answer from the person’s soul.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s spiritual consciousness approached the other party’s soul, the other party’s soul suddenly glowed and emitted powerful fluctuations.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He quickly withdrew his spiritual sense. The moment he withdrew his spiritual sense, the other party’s head exploded like a watermelon with a bang.</p><p>“Self-destruct!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy.</p><p>A self-destruction restriction had been set up in the other party’s soul. Once another person’s soul got close, the other party’s soul would self-destruct.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s no use. These are men of sacrifice trained by the great aristocratic families. There’s a self-destruction restriction in their souls. It’s impossible to find out any information by soul-searching!”</p><p>At this moment, Wu Ming, Wu Yue and Qiu Yue flew over.</p><p>“Men of sacrifice trained by great families? Which great families train suicide soldiers?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>some of the big aristocratic families in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion have trained death Warriors to carry out some shady missions in secret. Our Wu family has them too!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, and these men of sacrifice are extremely well-hidden. There’s no way to tell which clan they belong to!” Wang Chong said.</p><p>Wu Yue replied.</p><p>“Let’s try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was still unwilling to give up. He began interrogating the remaining four men in the blood-red robes.</p><p>However, the other party did not say a word.</p><p>If he were to search the soul, the other party’s soul would explode.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming had no choice but to finish off the rest of the men in blood-red robes.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly.</p><p>He had a feeling that these men of sacrifice were here for something on him. Lu Ming speculated that it was most likely the storage ring of the night Demon Lord.</p><p>if it’s really for the night Demon King’s storage ring, it’s very likely to be related to the nine absolute divine crystal being stolen. There might be clues in the night Demon King’s storage ring, so they want to take it back!</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking but he had more doubts.</p><p>He had already checked the night Demon Lord’s storage ring, but he had found nothing.</p><p>Originally, he wanted to find out who had sent them to kill him. If he could find the person behind it, he might be able to find the person who had stolen the nine absolute divine crystal.</p><p>Unfortunately, all the clues were gone.</p><p>looks like I’ll have to be more careful in the future. This time, it’s all thanks to QiuQiu!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly glad.</p><p>He had to admit that he was quite lucky.</p><p>Fortunately, QiuQiu had woken up before this and its strength had greatly improved. Otherwise, he would really be in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming, let’s hurry to the universal camp. There are many experts in the universal camp. No matter which organization it is, they wouldn’t dare to send people to commit murder in the universal camp.</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, the four of them set off for the universal camp.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the other three left, a few black-robed men appeared.</p><p>When the black-robed men saw the corpses on the ground, they were dumbfounded.</p><p>“What’s going on? What was going on? Even a Godking was killed. That brat is definitely not that strong!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
