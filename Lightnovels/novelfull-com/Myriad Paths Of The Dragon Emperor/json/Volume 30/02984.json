At that moment, in the sky far away, an elder was watching them from afar.</p><p>it’s here, it’s here, it’s finally here. After so many years, it’s finally here, hahaha!</p><p>The old man laughed, his body shaking with excitement.</p><p>After a while, the old man’s emotions calmed down. Then, his eyes flickered a few times. He took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we’ll take our leave then!”</p><p>Wu Yue and Wu Ming cupped their fists and planned to leave.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar was heard.</p><p>Then, a few people stepped on the air and came above Lu Ming and the others. A cold aura spread toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eh? The Qin family and Jin Xing!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw a few familiar faces.</p><p>One of them was Jin Xing, the one who had been defeated by Lu Ming when he went to the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>There were a few young men beside Jin Xing.</p><p>Two of them had a scale between their eyebrows. Lu Ming could tell at a glance that they were from the same family as Qin wuyou and Qin Wushang.</p><p>Since these people could fly in the air, it meant that they also lived on this Star Peak.</p><p>However, with Jin Xing’s cultivation, it was impossible for him to live here. He should be living in someone else’s garden.</p><p>The few of them looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Jin Xing, this is the brat who killed my cousin wuyou?”</p><p>One of the young men with a scale on his forehead said coldly.</p><p>that’s right, it’s him. He was the one who killed Qin wuyou in the Qin heaven Star Domain!</p><p>Jin Xing pointed at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Very good, you dare to kill my Qin family’s people, you’re courting death!”</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s elites said coldly. He took a step forward and landed in front of Lu Ming. His cold aura pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained unchanged.</p><p>“Kid, I’m going to challenge you to a life-and-death battle!”</p><p>The Qin clan’s chosen said.</p><p>“I don’t have time, I’m not fighting!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected him directly.</p><p>The Qin family’s prodigy gave him an unfathomable feeling. To be honest, Lu Ming was not confident.</p><p>Since he was not confident, why did Lu Ming have to fight?</p><p>“Don’t fight?”</p><p>The Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite was slightly stunned. His eyes revealed killing intent as he said, ” “Today, you have to fight even if you don’t want to!”</p><p>With that, a powerful aura rose from his body, and a terrifying pressure spread out in all directions.</p><p>Half-step Divine King realm!</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>The Qin clan’s genius was a half-step Divine King.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of ordinary half-step divine kings. He could easily crush them, such as the nine great demon masters of the demon Capital Mountain.</p><p>However, the man before him was clearly not an ordinary half-step Divine King. He was a peerless heaven’s favorite who had mastered the divine-grade divine power. His combat strength was not something that ordinary people could compare to.</p><p>If the other party was close to awakening the divine power factor, their combat strength would be even more shocking. Even if Lu Ming went all out, he might not be a match for them.</p><p>However, if he really had to fight, Lu Ming was not afraid. At most, he would fight with all his might.</p><p>If it was a life-and-death battle, Lu Ming could burn his ancient God heart and kill the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was also filled with a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Wu Ming called out.</p><p>“You, have something to say?”</p><p>The Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert looked at Wu Ming coldly.</p><p>“I remember there’s a rule in the star sky Camp! If a new member successfully challenges an old member of Star Peak and takes away the other party’s courtyard, they will have a 50 year protection period. Within these 50 years, they can refuse the challenge of others.”</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, there is indeed such a rule!”</p><p>indeed, this is to protect the new members!</p><p>Some people also started to discuss.</p><p>Although it was very difficult for new members to challenge the geniuses living on Star Peak …</p><p>However, there would always be some terrifying talents among the new members. It was still possible to succeed, such as Lu Ming this time.</p><p>That was why this rule was made to protect the new members.</p><p>The Qin clan’s elites, Jin Xing, and the others also remembered, and their faces darkened.</p><p>“Oh? If there’s such a rule, then hurry up and get lost. If you want to fight me, come back 50 years later!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands casually, as if he was dismissing a beggar.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon roared in his heart. He really wanted to slap Lu Ming to death. Unfortunately, he could not go against the rules of the universal camp.</p><p>“Brat, if you have the guts, then accept my challenge. Don’t be a tortoise!”</p><p>The Qin family’s Paragon shouted coldly, hoping to use the law to provoke Lu Ming into accepting the challenge.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not fall for such a low-level goading.</p><p>alright, if you suppress your cultivation to the same level as mine, I’ll accept your challenge!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The Qin clan’s chosen fell silent.</p><p>What a joke, suppress to the same level as Lu Ming?</p><p>Didn’t they see how Lu Ming, a fourth-level celestial deity, defeated icehawk?</p><p>If he was at the same level as Lu Ming, he would be courting death.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you dare to? If you don’t dare, then don’t talk nonsense here. You only know how to use your cultivation level to suppress others. What kind of heaven’s favorite are you? you’re more like trash!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon almost vomited blood in anger.</p><p>He wanted to insult Lu Ming but he could not. Instead, he was insulted.</p><p>“You what? If you don’t dare, then get lost and don’t disturb my cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re so bold!”</p><p>At this moment, Jin Xing roared.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jin Xing in surprise.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re from the Qin heaven Starfield. The people from the Qin heaven Starfield have stolen the nine absolute God crystal, the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and are now atoning for their crime. Do you have any ulterior motives?”</p><p>Jin Xing roared, his eyes flashing with a cunning light.</p><p>a person from the Qin heaven Starfield. I didn’t expect that he’s from the Qin heaven Starfield!</p><p>“The people of the Qin heaven Starfield are indeed guilty of their crimes now!”</p><p>When many people heard that Lu Ming was from the Qin heaven Starzone, they looked at him with hostility.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s treasure had been stolen, and the target was the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>Now, although they had given the Qin heaven Starzone a thousand years, the people of the Qin heaven Starzone were all suspects.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you actually joined the universal camp in secret. You must have an ulterior motive. Tell me, did you steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>Jin Xing shouted coldly, directly pinning a huge hat on Lu Ming.</p><p>your words are like farts. Do you think that with my cultivation, I can steal treasures from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he replied indifferently.</p><p>isn’t that simple? there’s definitely a mole of yours in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Jin Xing’s eyes turned and fell on Wu Ming and Wu Yue. He sneered and said,”I suspect that the Wu family is your spy and helped you steal the nine absolute God crystal!”</p><p>As soon as he said that, Wu Ming and Wu Yue’s expressions changed.</p><p>Jin Xing’s words were despicable!</p><p>This was to bring the Wu family to its doom.</p><p>“Jin Xing, you’re f * cking bullshitting. You have to have evidence. If you have the ability, show me the evidence.”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
