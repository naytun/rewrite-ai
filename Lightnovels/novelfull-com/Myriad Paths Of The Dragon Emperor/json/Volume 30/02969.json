Then, a figure stepped out and stood in the sky.</p><p>This person was the night Demon King.</p><p>Night Demon King, you’ve finally appeared!</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior, the blood-robed youth, said coldly.</p><p>“Why? Why do you want to kill us?”</p><p>The night Demon Lord’s face was filled with malevolence.</p><p>“Why are there so many whys? Do I need a reason to destroy a small mountain like yours?”</p><p>The young man who was covered in golden demonic light was very overbearing.</p><p>“Hahaha, I don’t need a reason. Indeed!”</p><p>The night Demon King laughed and his eyes became more ferocious. He stared at the four heaven’s favorites and sneered, ” you may be talented, but you’re only heavenly gods. Do you think you can fight me? ”</p><p>“Also, you just had a great battle, so you must have used up a lot of your divine power, hehehe!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord sneered.</p><p>“So the reason you didn’t come out just now was to waste our Shen power. What a cruel method!”</p><p>The black-robed youth said.</p><p>It was obvious that the night Devil King had long known about the battle outside, but no matter how the demon masters shouted, the night Devil King did not appear. He was planning to let the demon masters consume the divine power of these geniuses.</p><p>The more he consumed, the more confident he was.</p><p>hehehe, those trash, they died a worthy death for me. But you, so many heaven’s favorites. Today, I can kill so many heaven’s favorites with my own hands. It’s not a waste to come to this world. Hahaha!</p><p>The night Demon Lord sneered, and his aura became even more violent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He suddenly struck out with his palm.</p><p>This palm was aimed directly at the heaven’s favorite who was covered in golden light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the youth covered in golden light was constantly paying attention to the night Demon King. As soon as the night Demon King attacked, he attacked as well, a giant Golden Palm print blasting forward.</p><p>The two palm prints clashed in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The air exploded, and the force spread in all directions.</p><p>Then, the Golden Palm print crumbled. The young man, who was covered in golden light, retreated and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“There’s an unbridgeable gap between the heavenly God Realm and the divine King realm. Today, I’ll let you all know that the gap between the heavenly God Realm and the divine King realm can’t be made up by talent alone!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   the night Demon King roared, his entire body radiating dazzling light like a Burning Star, his divine power thick to the extreme.</p><p>At the divine King realm, a condensed star core was simply too powerful. Even the weakest Divine King was many times stronger than a heavenly God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The night Demon King moved again, continuing to attack the young man who was covered in golden light.</p><p>“King’s Pagoda!”</p><p>At this moment, the young man, who was covered in golden light, let out a long roar. His glabella shone, and a small Pagoda flew out.</p><p>The small Pagoda turned golden, and after it flew out, it rapidly grew in size, becoming the size of a mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>&Nbsp; the small tower trembled, and a mysterious energy spread out, enveloping the night Demon King.</p><p>The night Demon Lord’s aura trembled, as if it was unstable.</p><p>“Damn it, a treasure that is specially used to deal with godkings …”</p><p>The night Demon Lord roared.</p><p>This kind of treasure was not a divine artifact but a secret treasure that had been refined through special means. This kind of secret treasure was specially used to deal with godkings. It produced a special fluctuation that could affect the core of a Godking’s star.</p><p>With an unstable star core, one’s strength would naturally be greatly reduced.</p><p>Of course, the higher one’s cultivation was, the smaller the impact would be.</p><p>However, to a 1-stage God King like the night Demon King, the impact was still huge.</p><p>“If talent can’t make up for it, what about treasures?”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   the Golden youth laughed coldly, his aura erupting as he charged at the dark night Godking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged another blow. This time, it was still the young man covered in golden light who retreated.</p><p>“You want to use a single treasure to deal with me? dream on!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   the night Demon King roared and madly activated his divine power, trying to rush out of the king-suppression tower’s range.</p><p>“Who said there’s only one treasure, the king destroying Bell!”</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother waved his hand, and a large green bell flew out.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The bell vibrated, creating sound waves that rushed toward the night Demon King.</p><p>The aura on the night Demon Lord’s body trembled again, becoming unstable.</p><p>“Jue King Sword!”</p><p>The black-robed young man shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, a combat sword flew out. Endless sword Qi rushed toward the night Demon King.</p><p>Three treasures, three treasures that were specially used to deal with godkings.</p><p>This time, Night Demon Lord’s expression really changed, becoming extremely ugly.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Three Treasures, he could feel the star core in his body trembling non-stop as if it was being suppressed. No matter how hard he tried to operate it, he could not exert all his strength.</p><p>Hmph, Night Demon King, today is the day you die. Hehe!</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother sneered. His body flashed and he charged toward the night Demon King.</p><p>At the same time, the other three ninth-level celestial deity prodigies also charged towards the night Demon King.</p><p>“You want to kill me? dream on!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   the night Demon King roared. He wouldn’t let himself be captured without a fight, so he used all his strength to resist.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; the four heaven’s favorites and the night Demon King were engaged in an intense battle. The city Lord Mansion was in an uproar, and all sorts of divine light flew around.</p><p>In the surroundings, the battle between the other heaven’s favorites and the Shanghai guards had already stopped.</p><p>The remaining Shanghai guards who had not died had long since escaped.</p><p>The elites didn’t pursue. Their targets were the nine demon masters and the night Demon King. Killing the demonic city guards was useless.</p><p>During this process, Lu Ming did not make a move.</p><p>How could he stupidly rush out when it was such a good opportunity to sit on the mountain and watch the Tiger’s head and reap the benefits?</p><p>He focused on recovering and healing his injuries.</p><p>The wounds on his body had basically healed, and his physical strength had also recovered by 60 – 70%.</p><p>He was waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>“Let’s attack too!”</p><p>On the side, Pei Lin, Wu Xue, and a few other stronger heaven’s favorites also joined the battle.</p><p>Under the influence of the heirloom, their strength was enough to pose a threat to the night Demon Lord.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides had been fighting for a few minutes.</p><p>Night Demon King was gradually losing and was at a disadvantage.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A sword light flashed, and a sword wound appeared on the night Demon King’s body, blood flowing out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the young man covered in golden light hit the night Demon King with his palm, making the night Demon King stagger and retreat. Blood oozed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Seeing that the night Demon Lord was injured, the paragons were even more excited. They used all kinds of techniques, divine skills, and secret skills, which broadened Lu Ming’s horizons.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the secret skills controlled by the paragons of the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion were shockingly powerful. Some of them were even close to his Divine Dragon materialization technique.</p><p>Of course, this was because Lu Ming had not cultivated the divine Dragon materialization technique to major success.</p><p>He had obtained the divine Dragon materialization art from a legacy site. The more he cultivated, the more unfathomable he felt.</p><p>If he could cultivate hundreds or thousands of divine Dragons in the future, Lu Ming was looking forward to the power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
