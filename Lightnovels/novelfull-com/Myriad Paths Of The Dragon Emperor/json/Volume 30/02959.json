At this moment, 90% of the seats were occupied by people of all kinds.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a huge battle was taking place in the middle of the fighting ring.</p><p>An expert from the serpent-men race was currently engaged in an intense battle with a desolate beast.</p><p>The serpent-men experts were first level celestial deities, and that desolate beast was also first level celestial deity.</p><p>The two of them were at the same cultivation level, and the battle was extremely brutal.</p><p>However, that desolate beast was clearly more ferocious. It was not afraid of death and it roared continuously as it pounced towards the serpent-Men Expert.</p><p>The serpent-men experts were gradually losing and were forced to retreat.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>In the end, the desolate beast went crazy. It risked its own injuries and tore the serpent-Men Expert into pieces, causing blood to splatter all over the ground.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“Good kill, it’s exciting!”</p><p>At the scene, there was another wave of cheers. Countless people were shouting excitedly.</p><p>“Men, clean up!”</p><p>Immediately, someone came to the fighting ring and cleaned up the corpses of the human-snake hybrid clan and wiped the blood stains.</p><p>The injured dire beast was also brought down.</p><p>Following that, another battle broke out.</p><p>The target of the battle was a burly human, and on the other side, it was still a desolate beast.</p><p>it’s time to bet, it’s time to start betting. Both sides have peak stage nine true God cultivation. Which side are you betting on? ”</p><p>An old man stood in the air above the fighting ring, and his voice spread throughout the entire arena.</p><p>I think the desolate beast is stronger. I’ll bet 10000 mid-grade divine crystals on the desolate beast!</p><p>no, I think that human warrior’s blood Qi is surging and full of killing intent. I think he’ll be stronger. I bet 20000 divine crystals on the human warrior!</p><p>Many people began to place their bets.</p><p>However, it was very simple for them to place their bets. Many of them had something like an array card in their hands. They would enter the amount of money they had bet on and who they wanted to bet on. When they left this place, they would calculate the results.</p><p>The Colosseum was organized by the night Demon King, and no one dared to renege on their debt.</p><p>The bets were placed and the battle began.</p><p>The burly human and the wild beast were engaged in a fierce battle. Both of them were at peak stage nine true God Realm. However, the moment they attacked, the burly human had the upper hand.</p><p>The human’s attack was decisive, and one could tell with a single glance that he was someone who had experienced hundreds of battles. His attack power was very powerful.</p><p>From the start, he was suppressing the desolate beast.</p><p>“I’m winning, I’m winning!”</p><p>Those who bet on the human race were overjoyed, while those who bet on the wild beasts sighed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After fighting the wild beast for dozens of moves, the burly human roared and slashed out, beheading the wild beast.</p><p>The burly human won!</p><p>“Men, clean up!”</p><p>In the sky above the fighting ring, the old man ordered again.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, a silver-robed young man stood up from his seat and stepped out in the air.</p><p>it’s WAN Xing! That human is finished!</p><p>that’s right. I think Wan Xing has bet wrongly again. He bet on the desolate beast. Every time he bets wrongly, he will be in a bad mood. Once he is in a bad mood, he will kill someone!</p><p>shush, lower your voice. He’s the son of the devil Lord!</p><p>Many people started whispering to each other when they saw the young man. They seemed to be very afraid of him.</p><p>Demon master was a name for the demon capital.</p><p>Under the night Demon King, there were nine demon masters. Each demon master’s cultivation was extremely profound, surpassing the ninth level celestial deity. They were all half-step divine kings.</p><p>In the heavenly God Realm, if one wanted to break through to the God King realm, one must first form a star core.</p><p>Only when a star core was successfully formed could one be considered a true God King.</p><p>However, the star core was not something that could be condensed just because one wanted to. There was a transition in the process of condensing the star core. During this process, the star core would not be completely condensed. However, it was also the process of transforming from divine fire to the star core. This was the transition from a heavenly God to a Godking. It was the transition to the half-step Godking realm.</p><p>The strength of a half-step Divine King was inferior to a true Divine King, but it was also a great deal stronger than ordinary ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>The nine demon masters under the dark night Demon King were such existences.</p><p>Wan Xing was the only son of one of the demon masters. In demonic city, he was naturally a character who could do whatever he wanted.</p><p>“Young master Wan!”</p><p>The old man in the air saluted Wan Xing.</p><p>you made me lose money. You deserve to die. Kill!</p><p>kill! Wan Xing shouted coldly and charged at the human.</p><p>what? ” the human was shocked. He roared and blocked with all his might.</p><p>However, Wan Xing’s cultivation base was at the first level of the heavenly deity realm. Although the burly human was strong, he was still a long way off from Wan Xing.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered in all directions as the burly human was slain by Wan Xing with a single sword strike.</p><p>After killing the burly human, Wan Xing snorted coldly and returned to his seat.</p><p>The old man in the air didn’t even dare to let out a fart.</p><p>After all, Wan Xing’s father, the Lord of all demons, was sitting in the Colosseum. Whoever dared to say anything about Wan Xing would be courting death.</p><p>Moreover, it was just a mere demonic slave. There were plenty of them, so it was not worth offending Wan Xing.</p><p>Someone immediately cleaned up the fighting ring.</p><p>alright, the next demonic slave to fight is a new one. He’s very young and I heard that he’s quite strong. Everyone, make your bets!</p><p>In the air, the old man spoke again. Then, he waved his hand, and the door at the side of the fighting ring opened.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The roar of a wild beast came from one of the doors, and a huge creature walked out.</p><p>This was a huge bull with the cultivation of tier eight true God.</p><p>A young man stepped out of the other door.</p><p>“Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>At the sight of this figure, Lu Ming’s heart trembled.</p><p>The figure was Wu Zifeng.</p><p>After not seeing him for a while, Wu Zifeng looked a lot more Haggard. It was obvious that he had suffered a lot during this time.</p><p>“Damn it, are these demon slaves?”</p><p>The killing intent in Lu Ming’s heart was extremely strong. At the thought of Qiu Yue fighting with dire beasts in such an environment for others to watch, Lu Ming could not wait to flatten Magic City mountain.</p><p>let’s start the bet. This young man has the cultivation of stage seven true God and the desolate beast is at stage eight true God!</p><p>The old man shouted from the sky.</p><p>stage seven true God versus stage eight true God? ”</p><p>could this young man be a heaven’s favorite? ”</p><p>Many people began to discuss how to place their bets!</p><p>Hmph, what a fool. Look at him, he’s just a pretty boy. What kind of genius is he? I’ll bet on the wild beast!</p><p>Wan Xing snorted coldly, betting on the desolate beast’s victory.</p><p>Although Wu Zifeng looked a lot more Haggard, he still couldn’t hide his handsomeness. On the other hand, Wan Xing looked ordinary. When he looked at Wu Zifeng, he couldn’t help but be jealous.</p><p>“This kid is doomed!”</p><p>Many people thought to themselves and shook their heads.</p><p>Wan Xing had bet on the wild beast’s victory. If the wild beast really won, then Wu Zifeng must have died at the hands of the demonic beast.</p><p>If Wu Zifeng won and caused Wan Xing to lose money, looking at Wan Xing’s appearance, he would probably not let Wu Zifeng off.</p><p>No matter what, Wu Zifeng had to die!</p><p>Very quickly, the bets were placed and the battle began.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant bull roared and charged at Wu Zifeng. Its huge body shook the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
