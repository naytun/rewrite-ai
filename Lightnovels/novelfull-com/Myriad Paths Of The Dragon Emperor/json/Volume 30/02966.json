This surge of energy was extremely violent. It was many times stronger than the energy from a volcanic eruption.</p><p>It was hot, extremely hot!</p><p>The searing energy was like a tsunami, crashing into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently. He already had some injuries on his body. After being hit by this energy, his injuries were further aggravated.</p><p>“Ah, get up there!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. He controlled the energy and directed it to flow along his arm and into the long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear vibrated, forming a rebound force that actually lifted the opponent’s combat sword a little.</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to stand up straight.</p><p>“This kid, how can he still burst out with power?”</p><p>The people from the Dragon Cave were not only shocked, they were even a little frightened.</p><p>Then, he activated his divine power even more crazily. This time, he had to kill Lu Ming. Otherwise, Magic City mountain would be destroyed.</p><p>“Refine, refine …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was circulating the universe thousand Dao Scripture with all his might, refining the energy in his body.</p><p>However, the energy of the star core had not been refined by the ” measure ” formula. It was very difficult to absorb it. Compared to the energy that had been refined, it was a world of difference.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not care about that now. He kept circulating his cultivation technique to absorb this energy and use it to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Not only was the speed of absorption slow, but it was also impure. Even if Lu Ming had a breakthrough in his cultivation, his Foundation would be unstable.</p><p>But he couldn’t care about that now. If his Foundation was unstable, so be it. At most, he would spend more time to Polish his Foundation.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The violent energy was rampaging in Lu Ming’s body. It was unusually overbearing.</p><p>If it was an ordinary third level heavenly deity, no, not to mention third level heavenly deity, even if it was a ninth level heavenly deity, the divine body would probably explode from this energy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s divine body was no ordinary divine body.</p><p>After he had condensed the ancient God’s heart, his divine body could be tempered at any time, and he would become stronger day by day.</p><p>Moreover, he had transformed into a green-armored ancient God, and his divine body was even more powerful. He was able to block the energy.</p><p>it’s not enough. Old Liang, release more energy!</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“Also, little brat, you have to act within your means!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula expressed his concern.</p><p>“I know, come!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That brat, get ready …”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, another wave of energy rushed out.</p><p>This energy was even more violent and scorching than before. At this moment, Lu Ming’s body turned red. Even the green armor on his skin turned fiery red.</p><p>His body was like a balloon, swelling up.</p><p>The blood on the wound spurted out like it was free.</p><p>WOWO, old Liang, you’re spitting out too much energy. Are you trying to stuff me to death? ”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in pain.</p><p>“You were the one who asked for it. I’ve already reminded you …”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless. He could only clench his teeth and circulate the universe thousand Dao Scripture frantically to absorb this energy.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body rumbled as if a volcano was constantly erupting. His cultivation level was also rising rapidly.</p><p>Peak third level celestial deity, then towards fourth level celestial deity, it launched an assault.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body continued to rumble. With each rumble, Lu Ming’s body trembled and more blood flowed out of his wounds.</p><p>Lu Ming was bathed in blood and looked as if he would collapse at any moment. However, he managed to withstand the other party’s attack.</p><p>this kid is strange. Fight! We’ll fight too!</p><p>die! evil roared. He did not know why, but he had a bad feeling in his heart. He felt that if Lu Ming did not die today, he would be the one to die.</p><p>His eyes were filled with ruthlessness as the Shen power in his body started to burn.</p><p>All evil burned his divine power, and his strength increased dramatically. The power of the swords formed by the formation also increased.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and he almost failed to block it.</p><p>“You two, burn your Shen power together and kill this kid!”</p><p>Evil looked at Dragon Cave and the other demon master.</p><p>However, the Dragon Cave and the other demon master hesitated.</p><p>Burning Shen power was very harmful to the body.</p><p>Even if it was a normal person, burning Shen power would cause their vitality to be greatly damaged or their cultivation to fall.</p><p>The half-step Divine King realm was even more special.</p><p>This realm was the realm of condensing the star core. The star core was about to be condensed, but not condensed. It was the most critical moment. If he burned his divine power at this time, his cultivation would fall back to the ninth level heavenly God Realm if he made a mistake. He might not even have the chance to charge towards the God King realm in the future.</p><p>It wasn’t easy to cultivate to this level, so they wouldn’t easily burn it.</p><p>this kid can’t hold on for much longer. Let’s hold on a little longer and we’ll be the ones to win!</p><p>Dragon Cave said. He refused to burn his Shen power.</p><p>“You guys …” Evildoer was helpless.</p><p>He could only burn his divine power with all his might. He even threatened some of the Shanghai guards to burn their divine power to press down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Soon, soon …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming could already sense the fourth-level celestial deity barrier and was launching a violent attack.</p><p>One time, two times, three times …</p><p>After more than a dozen attacks.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A deafening explosion erupted from within Lu Ming’s body. The fourth level celestial deity barrier was finally broken through by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had stepped into the fourth-level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>After stepping into the fourth-level heavenly God Realm, the ten divine flames in his dantian were even more vigorous. The divine power in his body was even more turbulent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had also improved.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. A violent force flowed along his arm and rushed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear vibrated crazily. In an instant, it vibrated hundreds of millions of times. In an instant, Lu Ming swept away the opponent’s combat sword. Then, he led Qiu Yue and the rest to take a step forward and avoid the opponent’s attack.</p><p>The Battle Sword formed by the opponent’s formation continued to slash down after being knocked away. It hit the fighting ring and split it in half.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to cast the strongest move of the three apocalyptic strikes, Star Blast.</p><p>All the divine energy in his body, including the energy from the star core that had not been refined completely, flowed out through Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>All of his power was transformed into his most powerful move, Star Blast!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A shocking spear radiance soared into the sky and charged towards the formation that evil and the others had formed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Evil and the others roared as they activated the formation. Divine power gathered and once again formed a combat sword, which was then slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Exploding star collided with his opponent’s combat sword, creating a terrifying explosion. The energy formed from the collision spread in all directions.</p><p>This attack was truly like a battle between two godkings. The shockwave that spread in all directions crushed the corpses of the fallen experts in the Colosseum into dust.</p><p>Everything within a hundred thousand miles was razed to the ground.</p><p>This was also because Magic City had been set up with formations everywhere. Otherwise, the destructive power would have been countless times more terrifying.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted coldly. The huge Spear’s gleam exploded. This was the correct way to activate the ‘star explosion’ move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
