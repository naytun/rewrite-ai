You’re here to participate in the great battle of Shanghai, right? Very well, I hope you don’t meet me in the great battle of demonic city. Otherwise, I’ll make you die a miserable death!”</p><p>“Junior Sister, let’s go!”</p><p>After leaving these words, the witch Blood and the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Good luck?</p><p>Who was the lucky one?</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and left the place.</p><p>In the next few days, nothing much happened. However, the number of foreign heaven’s favorites in demonic city increased.</p><p>Many of these foreign heaven’s favorites had grudges against each other, so it was inevitable that they would clash with each other. Hence, during this period of time, the Shanghai guards had increased their patrols.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he still did not have a single clue about Qiu Yue, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong. He was in a bad mood.</p><p>Finally, the time for the great battle in demonic city had arrived.</p><p>On this day, a huge open space outside the city Lord’s mansion in Shanghai was filled with people.</p><p>Many people in Shanghai had come to watch.</p><p>The empty space was surrounded by Magic City guards in iron armor.</p><p>“The city Lord has arrived!”</p><p>A shout was heard. Then, a group of people flew out.</p><p>The leader was a burly man in a black demon robe.</p><p>This man’s aura was extraordinary, and a King’s Qi faintly emanated from him. With a single glance, one could tell that he was a God King.</p><p>This man was the Lord of demonic city, the night Demon King!</p><p>Beside the night Demon Lord was a young woman.</p><p>This woman looked to be in her twenties. Her figure was extremely good, revealing her slender and alluring figure.</p><p>Her figure was perfect, so explosive, and captivating.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman, what an alluring woman!”</p><p>is this girl the Daughter of the Night Demon King? ”</p><p>When many men saw this woman, their eyes burned with passion and anger.</p><p>I heard that in this demonic City War, as long as you defeat the night Demon King’s woman and win first place, you will be able to date her and even have the chance to become her son-in-law!</p><p>how can I miss out on such a beautiful woman? I want first place!</p><p>“The first place is mine!”</p><p>In the crowd, many foreign heaven’s favorites had fiery eyes and were rubbing their fists, wanting to get first place.</p><p>“Everyone, quiet down!”</p><p>The night Demon King stood high in the air and waved his hand, causing the entire place to fall silent.</p><p>“I am dark night sky!”</p><p>Night Demon Lord introduced himself. Night sky was his name.</p><p>“This is my woman, night rose!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord introduced the enchanting woman beside him.</p><p>Everyone nodded. The enchanting woman was indeed the Daughter of the Night Devil King.</p><p>I believe that everyone has heard of the rules of the great battle in Shanghai. However, I’m going to announce it again now!</p><p>this battle will be divided into 32 battle platforms!</p><p>At this point, the night Demon King waved his hand, and thirty-two light balls flew out of his sleeve. After they flew out, they expanded in the wind and quickly became thirty-two huge battle stages, floating in the air.</p><p>there are 32 battle platforms. You can enter any one of them. Once you step onto the platform, you will be able to fight each other. The one who remains on the platform will be the one who successfully advances to the next round. There will be a total of 32 heaven’s favorites who will advance to the next round!</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>This rule was simple, but it was also extremely cruel.</p><p>There were 32 fighting rings, and the number of people fighting for each fighting ring was definitely not small. However, in the end, only one person could win each fighting ring.</p><p>the thirty-two people who have advanced will fight in pairs. The top ten will receive a Jin of demon night spring as a reward. At the same time, they can also join Magic City mountain and immediately become the demon Lord, second only to me!</p><p>the first place will get five kilograms of demon night spring. Also, you will have the chance to date my daughter!</p><p>The night Demon Lord explained the rules simply.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning.</p><p>To many foreign heaven’s favorites, becoming the Demon King of demon Capital Mountain was not attractive at all. To them, the demon night spring was the attractive one.</p><p>Of course, a beauty like the night rose naturally had a strong attraction.</p><p>alright, now, let the competition begin!</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, figures rushed out towards the 32 fighting rings.</p><p>There were people on every fighting ring.</p><p>get off! This fighting stage is mine!</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of a sudden, fierce fighting broke out on every fighting ring. Many people started to attack each other.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Blood gushed out, and miserable screams rang out. Immediately, someone was killed and fell on the fighting ring.</p><p>The battle was unusually brutal.</p><p>However, most of the people who had made their moves at the beginning were the local heaven’s favorites of Magic City mountain. Many outsiders had not made their moves yet.</p><p>After a while, an outsider heaven’s favorite finally made his move.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A burly man with a saber in his hand slashed out, and a shocking Saber Light flashed across the void. Seven or eight young men were cut by the saber Light and immediately died.</p><p>“What a strong cultivation!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>This burly youth’s cultivation had shockingly reached the eighth level heavenly deity realm. Furthermore, he was also a Divine Son level character.</p><p>The burly young man charged into the fighting ring. No one was his match. More than a dozen people died in his hands in a row. The others ‘expressions changed greatly. They knew that the gap between them and this man was too great. They could only leave this fighting ring and attack the other fighting rings.</p><p>This person’s strength was so shocking that the other heaven’s favorites would naturally not compete with him. They all flew to the other battle stages.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More and more heaven’s favorites started to fight. On each fighting ring, the battle was extremely intense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the other fighting ring, Wu Xue’s body was covered in blood mist. Anyone who was touched by the blood mist would let out a shrill scream and then fall straight on the fighting ring, without any breath.</p><p>Many people were frightened and kept their distance from the witch’s blood.</p><p>hahaha, what a bunch of trash. I want this fighting ring. Also, I want the night rose!</p><p>Wu Xue laughed loudly. He did not hide his voice, and it spread throughout the entire place.</p><p>Many of the young men from Magic City mountain had ugly expressions, but there was nothing they could do.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>On the other fighting ring, a young man in a black robe was holding a long spear. His combat strength was also extremely amazing, and no one could defeat him. He occupied a fighting ring.</p><p>Gradually, some terrifying figures appeared on each battle platform.</p><p>what terrifying strength. Many of these heaven’s favorites are not from the chutian star field!</p><p>“That’s right. With such strength, most of them are from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. What’s going on? Why are there so many powerful heaven’s favorites from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>In the crowd, a few elders from Magic City mountain were discussing and were a little surprised.</p><p>They thought that this time, they would only attract some geniuses from chutian Starfield. They didn’t expect that even geniuses from nine absolute Heavenly King Manor would come. It was a little strange.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
