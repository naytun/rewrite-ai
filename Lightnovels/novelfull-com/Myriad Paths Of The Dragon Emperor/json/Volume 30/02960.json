His figure flashed and he dodged the giant bull’s attack. Then, a sword light cut through the wind from his hand and slashed at the giant bull.</p><p>Fast, accurate, and ruthless!</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A long wound appeared on the giant cow’s body. It went straight through its bones and blood flowed out.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant bull screamed, but its bestial nature was also stimulated. It twisted its body and rushed toward Wu Zifeng again. Its two horns glowed and burst out two rays of light as sharp as divine knives.</p><p>However, a sword radiance burst forth from Wu Zifeng’s palm and collided with the giant bull’s attack.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The giant bull’s attack was sent flying by Wu Zifeng. He stepped forward and slashed again.</p><p>The sword was aimed at the giant bull’s neck.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. The giant cow’s head was directly cut off by Wu Zifeng’s sword.</p><p>Wu Zifeng only used two moves to kill the giant bull, which was one level higher than him.</p><p>This result was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>In fact, with Wu Zifeng’s strength, if he used his full strength, he could probably kill the giant bull in one move.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>“Haha, I won!”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar. Many people who had bet on Wu Zifeng’s victory were overjoyed.</p><p>As for those who bet on the desolate beast winning, they had ugly expressions.</p><p>The ugliest one was Wan Xing.</p><p>Today, he had failed to win again and again, so he was in an extremely bad mood.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! Wan Xing shouted angrily. His body burst out of his seat and rushed toward the fighting ring.</p><p>young master Wan, young master Wan, wait a moment …</p><p>The old man in the air quickly called out.</p><p>“If you have a fart, then quickly spit it out!”</p><p>Wan Xing impatiently shouted.</p><p>young master Wan, this man is extremely talented. We can’t kill him. He might be useful if we keep him alive!</p><p>The old man advised.</p><p>With Wu Zifeng’s strength, if he was properly trained, he might become a sharp blade of Magic City mountain.</p><p>“What can’t be killed? I’m telling you, there’s no one here that I can’t kill. What’s a little bit of talent to me? get lost. If you don’t get lost, I’ll kill you too!”</p><p>Wan Xing coldly shouted, his killing intent was cold.</p><p>The old man’s expression was unsightly, and he helplessly retreated.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Wan Xing stared at Wu Zifeng with a cold gaze.</p><p>“If you dare to touch me, I’ll definitely destroy Magic City mountain if I don’t die!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>He was the Wu family’s young master, and yet he had actually fallen into such a situation. He was also holding a breath in his heart.</p><p>“You still want to destroy my Magic City mountain? I’ll destroy you now!”</p><p>Wan Xing shouted and was about to charge towards Wu Zijin. However, at this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Wan Xing and blocked him.</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>He originally wanted to wait until he saw Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong before he made his move, but now, he had no choice but to do so!</p><p>“Kid, Who are you? Get lost!”</p><p>Wan Xing was furious when he saw that someone dared to stand in front of him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Wan Xing was stunned, and then he became furious.</p><p>In this Colosseum, there was actually someone who dared to tell him to get lost. He was courting death, simply courting death!</p><p>“Little bastard, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Wan Xing bellowed angrily and attacked Lu Ming with his palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming waved his hand.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Wan Xing was vulnerable in Lu Ming’s hands. Lu Ming easily dispersed his attack and slapped him in the face.</p><p>Wan Xing spun eighty-one times in the air. His face was as swollen as a pig’s head. He looked at Lu Ming with a dumbfounded expression. He only reacted after a long while.</p><p>”</p><p>Wan Xing screamed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Instantly, figures flew out from all directions of the arena.</p><p>There were men and women among these figures. All of them were wearing iron armor and they surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>brat, you dare to hit young master Wan? I think you’re tired of living. Kneel down and surrender!</p><p>One of the burly men strode forward and slapped Lu Ming.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was at the fourth level celestial deity realm and he thought that he was more than enough to take down Lu Ming!</p><p>“Brother Wu, where are Qiu Yue and lady Yue? Where are you? are you alright?”</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming was communicating quickly with Wu Zifeng.</p><p>they’re all fine. They’ve been locked up in this Colosseum. As long as we break through this Colosseum, we can save them!</p><p>Wu Zifeng quickly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“You brought this on yourself, you can’t live, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and threw a punch.</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon emerged and charged toward the burly man.</p><p>That fourth level celestial deity burly man didn’t even let out a miserable cry before his body exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>The others were stunned.</p><p>“You dare to kill a Magic City guard? how audacious! Let’s attack together!”</p><p>There were at least dozens of Shanghai guards in the surroundings. They roared at the same time. Divine power of various colors surged wildly and launched an attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>The demonic city guards were the guards of the demonic city, and they were much stronger than the general demon guards of the general Demon City.</p><p>Even the weakest of the Magic City guards was at the third level of the celestial deity realm.</p><p>Dozens of demonic city guards at the third level of heavenly deity realm and above attacked together, causing the weather to change.</p><p>“Today, I’ll raze the beast arena to the ground!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and cast the divine Dragon materialization art. Six nine-clawed divine Dragons roared and pounced at everyone. Each of them was ten thousand meters long.</p><p>Although these demonic city guards were strong, they were far inferior to Lu Ming. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma laksana pounced and all the attacks aimed at him were instantly destroyed. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon did not stop, its sharp claws constantly stepping out.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Miserable shrieks were heard continuously. A Magic City guard was torn apart by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon and died on the spot every second.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>At this moment, the spectators around the Colosseum were all dumbfounded. They didn’t think that someone would actually dare to cause trouble here. Furthermore, he was killing in all directions, even killing so many Shanghai guards. This was a huge matter.</p><p>I’m afraid that the entire Magic City will be in a riot.</p><p>As for Wan Xing himself, he was so scared that his face turned pale and his body trembled.</p><p>Every guard here was stronger than him, but they were all killed one after another.</p><p>“Young master Wan, quickly retreat!”</p><p>The old man who was in charge of the animal arena brought Wan Xing and retreated to the stands.</p><p>“You dare to cause trouble here, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Demonic city guards, move out and kill the invader!”</p><p>The entire Colosseum was alarmed. The doors on all sides of the fighting ring opened, and figures flew out from them. Powerful auras rose up.</p><p>Shanghai guards!</p><p>They were all Shanghai guards, and there were more than five hundred of them!</p><p>Among them, some people’s auras were extremely robust. They were all existences that surpassed seventh level celestial deity.</p><p>The great army of the Magic City guards that was guarding the Colosseum had arrived. This was a terrifying force. No one on Magic City mountain could rival it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
