There were grand palaces and elegant courtyards.</p><p>“Live on top of that? What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Don’t we live up there?”</p><p>Many young men were puzzled.</p><p>correct. You indeed don’t live there, because you don’t have the qualifications!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Not qualified? Where are we going to stay?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>The burly man did not answer. He smiled and continued forward.</p><p>Everyone was curious and followed closely behind. After they had crossed a few small hills, a foul smell hit them in the face.</p><p>“So stinky!”</p><p>Some of the women were frowning and looked disgusted.</p><p>“All of you will be staying there!”</p><p>The burly man pointed to the front.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a wide area in front of them. There were many small houses, which were very simple and crude. They were only casually built with wood.</p><p>Most importantly, around these wooden houses, there was a farm, raising many strange desolate beasts.</p><p>The source of the stench was the mixture of the waste and urine of these desolate beasts.</p><p>“What? We’re living in this kind of place? Impossible, I’m not staying!”</p><p>“Is this kind of trash for people to live in?”</p><p>A few of the women screamed.</p><p>“It’s fine if you don’t want to stay, but get lost!”</p><p>The burly man said coldly.</p><p>The few women shut up, but their eyes turned, obviously thinking of a solution.</p><p>I’m telling you, you have to stay here even if you don’t want to. You can’t stay anywhere else. These are the rules. If you break them, you’ll be expelled from the universal camp forever!</p><p>The burly man said coldly.</p><p>Some of the women’s faces were pale, and some of the men were frowning.</p><p>Some people did have such an idea just now and simply gave up. It would be the same if they found a clean place to cultivate.</p><p>However, he had to stay there. This was the rule.</p><p>Those who were able to join the universal camp were almost all top geniuses who had mastered divine grade divine power. In the Qin Tian star region, they were people at the divine Son level.</p><p>90% of such people came from big forces or big families. When had they ever lived in such a place?</p><p>Many of them furrowed their brows. They didn’t expect that they would have to stay in such a place when they came to the universal camp. Furthermore, none of the people who had joined the universal camp in the past had ever mentioned that there was such a rule in the universal camp.</p><p>also, I’m warning you all. The rules of the universal camp must never be leaked out. If you do, you’ll be expelled from the universal camp and never allowed to enter again!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Many young women’s faces were pale, and many people’s mouths were bitter.</p><p>“Senior, how do I get to live up there?”</p><p>Someone pointed at the buildings on the mountain peak and asked.</p><p>The buildings here were at the foot of the mountain. When compared to the buildings on the mountainside, they were like heaven and earth.</p><p>if you want to live there, it’s very simple. You have to challenge them!</p><p>as long as you can defeat the people above, you can take over and cultivate there. At the same time, you can fly freely in this area!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>This made many people’s eyes burn with passion.</p><p>As long as he defeated the person living above him, he would be able to replace him.</p><p>It was obvious that the buildings on the mountain peak were not only much better than at the foot of the mountain, but they were also closer to the top of the mountain. The influence of the treasures at the top of the star Peak would be greater, and one’s comprehension ability would be better.</p><p>Furthermore, it could even fly!</p><p>They could obviously fly, but they couldn’t. They could only watch others looking down at them from above. That kind of feeling was extremely sullen.</p><p>“I’m going to challenge him!”</p><p>A young woman shouted, and a powerful aura emanated from her body.</p><p>Eighth level celestial deity!</p><p>This lady had a cultivation of the eighth level heavenly deity realm and was in control of the divine-grade divine power. If she was placed in the Qin heaven star region, she would be an unrivaled genius.</p><p>However, it was very normal here. Everyone’s faces were calm, and they were not surprised at all.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, the basic condition to be called a heaven’s favorite was to control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Those who did not control divine-grade divine power could not be called geniuses.</p><p>“I’m also going to challenge him!”</p><p>I want one too. Who’s going to live in this damn place!</p><p>People kept shouting.</p><p>These people were all geniuses in the outside world. They were one in a billion and were full of confidence in themselves.</p><p>you can’t challenge me now. You have to stay in those houses for seven days. After seven days, you can challenge me!</p><p>The burly man said coldly.</p><p>“What? Do I have to stay for seven days? What kind of rule is this!”</p><p>no, I won’t stay there. Senior, can you be lenient? in seven days, I’ll challenge the higher floors and stay there!</p><p>Many people were wailing.</p><p>“You don’t have to stay? sure, but please go back and stay in your Palace courtyard!”</p><p>The burly man said indifferently and then stepped forward.</p><p>Those who were wailing heaved a long sigh. They could only bear with it for now.</p><p>cut the crap and follow me. We’ll each choose a room and complete it within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. If you’re not done after that, I’ll personally send you home!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>Everyone sighed and could only follow him to choose a room.</p><p>Some of them wanted to choose the rooms that were further away from the farm and had a lighter smell, but they were disappointed.</p><p>These rooms were built right in the middle of the farm, and they were all identical. Every single one of them was filled with a terrible stench.</p><p>“Qiuyue, are you used to this?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Young master, don’t worry. It’s not like Qiuyue hasn’t suffered before!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>okay, then pick one. Seven days later, young master will bring you there!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others all picked a room.</p><p>After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, everyone found their rooms and settled down.</p><p>The burly man chuckled and left.</p><p>Lu Ming walked into the room. The room was very simple. There was only a bed and a wooden table. In the room, there was a foul smell.</p><p>Even Lu Ming could not help but frown.</p><p>Exhaling, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and cultivated in silence.</p><p>Seven days would pass by very quickly, so it didn’t matter anymore.</p><p>However, even if he could bear it, some people couldn’t.</p><p>It hadn’t even been a day, and someone was already roaring.</p><p>damn it, what the hell is this place? I’m going to kill my way up in seven days!</p><p>“I also want to kill my way up!”</p><p>Some people roared, their voices reverberating in the area.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. It seemed that many people had the same thoughts as him.</p><p>However, was it really that easy to kill his way up?</p><p>Lu Ming felt that it would not be easy.</p><p>This was because he had just observed that there were many such wooden houses before they moved in, and they were all occupied.</p><p>Those people were clearly from the universal camp.</p><p>The people who had joined in the past were still living here. It was clear that it would not be easy to kill their way up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
