He controlled many types of divine-grade divine power and was indeed very powerful. However, the resources and time he needed to cultivate were much more than others.</p><p>it’s a pity that the refining speed of the star core is too slow. If the energy of the star core were to pour in, I would be able to cultivate the five types of divine-grade divine power to a full state very quickly!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Hey, kid, are you blaming this old lady for refining too slowly?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words were heard by the ‘measure’ formula and it immediately cried out.</p><p>“I don’t …”</p><p>Lu Ming quickly denied it.</p><p>“Brat, it’s all because your cultivation base is too weak. Too weak, do you understand? He’s simply weak to the point of dregs. Heavenly God Realm, hehe!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula sneered, its resentment was shockingly great.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula mumbled again, all of them criticizing Lu Ming. After a long while, he stopped.</p><p>kid, let me tell you. It’s not impossible to quickly refine the energy in the core of a star!</p><p>After he finished criticizing, the tone of the ” measure ” character suddenly changed.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Without the help of the energy from the star core, Lu Ming would need at least tens of thousands of years to cultivate all five types of divine powers to the maximum even if he was on the star Peak.</p><p>After tens of thousands of years, even daylilies would have turned cold.</p><p>it’s very simple. The core of a star is extremely yang and strong. If you can find an object of extreme Yin and extreme cold for me to absorb and fuse with yin and yang, I can quickly refine the core of a star into energy!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Extreme Yin and extreme cold? Then, does the Cold Moon Stone count?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>no, the Cold Moon stone’s grade is too low. The ball of cold liquid in your ninth ice chain can do it!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“That liquid?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. However, he had already refined it and turned it into a divine power. It would definitely not work.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming thought of the treasure of the ice Soul Clan, the ice jade heart.</p><p>However, the ice jade cold heart was the clan treasure of the ice Soul Clan. It was impossible for him to refine and absorb it.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look at the star sky Camp market!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and left the room, heading to the market of the star sky Camp.</p><p>Unfortunately, even though some cold-attribute treasures were discovered in the market of the universal camp, they did not meet the requirements.</p><p>One had to know that it was the core of a star. It was very difficult to find an item of extreme cold that matched it.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming went in and out of the city square. Unfortunately, he did not gain anything.</p><p>Lu Ming could only rely on himself to cultivate slowly.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture to accumulate divine power while he cultivated various divine skills.</p><p>He discovered that the complete version of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique was even more profound than the incomplete version. This was especially so after the seventh level. It was simply a whole lot more profound.</p><p>After cultivating it, it really had the power of the kun Peng, which could spread its wings and fly 100000 miles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come out and fight me!”</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly heard a loud roar from outside.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He extended his spiritual senses and found a young man standing in midair with a sharp gaze.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen this young man before.</p><p>it seems like the Jin and Qin families can’t hold back anymore!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then said,”I won’t fight until fifty years have passed!”</p><p>Lu Ming rejected her very directly.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, what kind of prodigy are you? You only know how to hide and don’t even dare to accept the challenge. I think you should just get out of the universal camp!”</p><p>The young man shouted coldly, his voice filled with disdain.</p><p>“Oh, really? Fine, suppress your cultivation to the same level as mine and I’ll fight you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The young man snorted coldly and did not reply.</p><p>“Why aren’t you talking? You don’t even dare to accept a battle at the same level, what kind of heaven’s favorite are you? You only know how to hide like a turtle. I think you should get out of the universal camp!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s disdainful voice was heard.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man was so angry that he almost vomited blood. Lu Ming had returned his words to him word for word.</p><p>In the end, the young man could only leave in dejection.</p><p>However, in less than a month, another young man came to challenge Lu Ming. He was provoking and slandering Lu Ming in various ways.</p><p>However, Lu Ming always said nonchalantly,’do you dare to fight me at the same level?’ After that, those people left dejectedly.</p><p>“Are these people really sent by the Jin and Qin families?”</p><p>Lu Ming had some doubts after being continuously challenged.</p><p>If it was the Jin family or the Qin family, one or two challenges would be enough.</p><p>But it had already been four or five times.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but recall the assassination attempt he had encountered on his way to the star sky Camp.</p><p>Then who sent them?</p><p>Also, wasn’t there the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s backing behind Magic City mountain? How could it be destroyed by the star sky Camp as a test for the new recruits?</p><p>Could it be that the person who gave the test to the newcomers was the backer of Magic City mountain? the other party wanted to destroy Magic City mountain and destroy the evidence?</p><p>This was still very possible.</p><p>If that was the case, the night Demon King would definitely have evidence. That was why Lu Ming was assassinated on his way to the star Camp.</p><p>And among the people who challenged him, it was possible that they were sent by the other party to kill him and take away the evidence in his hands?</p><p>The more Lu Ming thought about it, the more he felt that it was possible!</p><p>However, it was impossible to check from the person who gave the test instructions to the newcomers.</p><p>Lu Ming had already asked Wu Ming and Wu Yue about this. The person who gave the test was a normal elder of the universal camp.</p><p>Obviously, the other party couldn’t have given such an order personally. It would probably be difficult to find out through special means.</p><p>Lu Ming’s hand moved and the night Demon King’s storage ring appeared in his hand.</p><p>If there was any evidence, it must be in the storage ring. However, Lu Ming did not find anything after flipping through it a few times.</p><p>“Watch it again!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to flip through the pages. In the end, he still did not find anything.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a bell came from the star Peak.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Lu Ming was curious and walked out of the room with Qiu Yue.</p><p>star-moon ancient city will open in 10 days. Those who wish to try their luck, please gather at the square at the foot of the mountain in 10 days!</p><p>A voice came from the top of the star Peak and spread throughout the entire star sky Camp area. Everyone could hear it.</p><p>“Star-moon ancient city is about to open again!”</p><p>this time, I must go in. I must awaken the origin divine power factor!</p><p>“Haha, this is my chance!”</p><p>Instantly, the entire universal camp was in an uproar. Many of the senior members were excited.</p><p>“Star-moon ancient city? What was that? Is it a historical site?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were puzzled.</p><p>“Let’s go ask Wu Ming and Wu Yue!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Then, he rose into the air with Qiu Yue and flew toward the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the foot of the mountain, and a pungent smell wafted over.</p><p>At this moment, the members of the universal camp at the foot of the mountain had also left the wooden house and were discussing the matter of star-moon ancient city. When they saw Lu Ming and Qiu Yue, each and every one of them had envious looks on their faces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
