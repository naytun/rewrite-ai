The nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion was the only way to the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Lu Ming had originally planned to head to the great void Holy dynasty when his cultivation was higher. However, there were benefits to heading to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion earlier. At least, he would be able to understand more about the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>“There’s no time to lose. I’ll leave in a few days!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and continued.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It’s best if you go to Magic City mountain first!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“Magic City mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look.</p><p>“That’s right, Magic City mountain!”</p><p>The clan leader nodded and said, ” to the West of the Qin heaven Starfield is a Starfield that’s close to the Qin heaven Starfield. It’s called the Chu heaven Starfield. The magic Capital Mountain is located in the Chu heaven Starfield!</p><p>in the past, when the dark ice Clan left the Qin Tian Starfield, they often went to Magic City mountain. I suspect that Magic City mountain is where the dark ice Clan and the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion come into contact. Therefore, we might be able to find clues on Magic City mountain. Very few people know about this. We have also been secretly watching the dark ice Clan and discovered it by accident!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go to Magic City mountain first!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Both parties chatted for a while more before Lu Ming got up and left.</p><p>Before he left, the ice Soul clan’s patriarch gave Lu Ming a star map of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. However, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion occupied a huge territory. The star map only gave a rough location. Many small places were not clearly marked.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming thought of Wu Zifeng.</p><p>Wu Zifeng came from the great Wu family of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He would still need help if he went to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Coincidentally, Wu Zifeng was in the Kong Xuan sect during this period of time.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming returned to the Kong Xuan sect and looked for Wu Zifeng. He explained his purpose of visit and Wu Zifeng agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Yue Linglong knew about it and also clamored to come along.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming brought Qiu Yue, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong with him and left Kong Xuan sect quietly without alerting anyone.</p><p>Want to leave the Qin heaven Starfield, one had to take the Interstar field teleportation array.</p><p>The Qin heaven Galaxy’s inter-Galaxy teleportation array was on Planet WAN Ling.</p><p>The four of them arrived at planet thousand spirits. After paying an expensive toll, they stepped into the teleportation formation to chutian star field.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he was traveling through the void. He looked at the lights and shadows that passed by him. He knew that he was moving forward at an astonishing speed.</p><p>However, the distance between the two star areas was too far. Even if they took the teleportation formation, the process would still be very long.</p><p>This process lasted for half a month.</p><p>The surroundings trembled, and a ray of light pierced through. Lu Ming knew that he had arrived at chutian Star Domain.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It would take half a month to teleport by using the teleportation array. One could imagine how long the distance was.</p><p>If they were to fly, it would take God knows how long. Even a Godking would not be able to cover such a long distance without thousands of years.</p><p>The distance between two star fields was often many times larger than the territory of the star field itself.</p><p>this is the mantuo Galaxy of the chutian Star Domain that’s closest to the Qin Tian Star Domain. Magic City mountain is on the other side. Let’s go!</p><p>Wu Zifeng was quite familiar with the chutian star field. He brought Lu Ming and the rest to the teleportation array and headed to Magic City mountain.</p><p>Magic City mountain was really a mountain, a huge mountain floating in the universe. It was like the mountain of desolation, incomparably huge, even bigger than many planets.</p><p>In the vast universe, there were all sorts of strange things and wonders. Not all of them were planets.</p><p>There were some divine mountains that were even larger than planets floating in the air.</p><p>There were even some continents that were suspended in the starry sky of the universe, forming their own world.</p><p>What was even more amazing was that there was an incomparably huge ancient city floating in the starry sky.</p><p>There were even huge ancient trees and huge desolate beast corpses. After evolution, they formed a world.</p><p>There were too many of such things to count. Lu Ming was not surprised.</p><p>After a month’s journey, they finally neared Magic City mountain.</p><p>Standing in The Universe’s Star field and looking from afar, a huge mountain floated in the starry sky. Above it, demonic mist permeated the air.</p><p>This was the Magic City mountain!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the lead and flew over. At the same time, he enveloped Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong with a divine power.</p><p>This was because Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng had not reached the celestial God Realm. The two of them were both in the seventh tier true God Realm.</p><p>To be honest, this cultivation speed was already extremely fast. Of course, compared to Lu Ming and Qiu Yue, there was a huge difference.</p><p>The four of them landed on the edge of Magic City mountain and then flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, a large city appeared in front of them.</p><p>On the city gate, there were three big words: Devil general city.</p><p>At the city gate, it was quite lively with people coming and going.</p><p>The four of them walked in and asked about the situation on Magic City mountain.</p><p>Magic City mountain was made up of 37 big cities.</p><p>One of the rulers was the demonic city.</p><p>The other thirty-six cities were the satellite cities of the Magic City mountain. They surrounded the Magic City and protected it.</p><p>On Magic City mountain, Magic City was high and mighty. They were the unquestionable rulers and were extremely powerful.</p><p>It was said that the city Lord of demonic city was a Godking called the dark night Godking.</p><p>Moreover, there was a special product in demonic city called the demon night spring. This kind of demon night spring was of great help to the soul of cultivators. It could nourish the soul and increase the strength of the soul.</p><p>The soul of a cultivator was the most important. It was very difficult to improve it.</p><p>One could imagine the value of the demon night spring.</p><p>The main source of income for Magic City mountain was the sale of the magic Night spring.</p><p>&Nbsp; but demon night spring was so precious that many factions were after it. Demon Capital Mountain’s dark night deity King was just an ordinary deity King, so he had no control over such a precious treasure.</p><p>But the fact was that no one dared to touch Magic City mountain.</p><p>That was because behind Magic City mountain, there was a powerful force from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Many major forces in the chutian star field knew that the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was behind the magic City mountain. However, they didn’t know which force it was.</p><p>it seems that if we want to investigate whether the dark ice Clan is colluding with the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, we have to start from the Magic City. However, the control of the Magic City is extremely strict, and outsiders are not allowed to enter!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>Unless it was a special occasion, outsiders were not allowed to enter Magic City. Therefore, Lu Ming had to think of a way to enter Magic City first before he could start his investigation.</p><p>Unfortunately, for the next few days, Lu Ming did not think of any good ways to enter Magic City.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming’s group of four strolled on the streets and continued to gather information. Suddenly, a few figures appeared in front of them and blocked their way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
