This meant that many of the geniuses who had entered the universal camp were still living here.</p><p>Those who were able to enter the universal camp weren’t weak. If it was so easy to kill their way up, those people would have already done so.</p><p>Seven days passed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>On the eighth day, voices began to echo out.</p><p>“Kill our way up, I want to live up there!”</p><p>“I’ve had enough of this place!”</p><p>Then, one figure after another rushed up Star Peak along the mountain road.</p><p>“Brother Lu, lady Qiuyue, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue walked over and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Together with Qiu Yue, they followed the mountain path and rushed up the mountain.</p><p>“Hehe, these newbies are going up to challenge him!”</p><p>A few figures walked out of a few wooden houses. These people were the old men who had joined the universal camp in the past.</p><p>they’ve just joined, and they’re all so full of themselves. They don’t know the immensity of the heavens and earth. There’s going to be a show to watch!</p><p>let’s go and take a look. The universal camp hasn’t been this lively in a long time!</p><p>Some of the older members of the universal camp laughed casually as they followed behind and headed up the mountain.</p><p>The star Peak was very high. Even at the waist of the mountain, it was more than a million feet high. However, to Lu Ming and the group, this was a piece of cake.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the mountainside.</p><p>On the mountainside, there were courtyards built. The air was dense and the fragrance of flowers assailed the nose. It was a refreshing feeling, completely different from the one at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning with passion. They swore that they would definitely get a courtyard this time.</p><p>“The people in the courtyard, get out here!”</p><p>A burly young man was the most anxious. He immediately appeared in front of a courtyard and shouted.</p><p>“Who’s shouting so loudly? you’re looking for death!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the courtyard. Then, the door opened, and a cold-looking young man walked out.</p><p>The cold-looking young man swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest, and his eyes fell on the burly young man. He said with a hint of disdain,”Are you new?”</p><p>“So what if he’s new? Let me tell you, I’ve taken a fancy to your courtyard and I’m challenging you now. Do you dare to accept the challenge? If you don’t dare, then quickly get lost!”</p><p>The burly young man shouted with confidence.</p><p>“You want to challenge me? Hehe, very well, make your move. If you can defeat me, you can have this courtyard!”</p><p>The cold-looking young man looked relaxed, as if he did not take the burly young man seriously at all.</p><p>“Presumptuous! Sky-shaking Saint elephant, suppress him!”</p><p>The burly young man shouted, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Eighth level celestial deity!</p><p>The burly young man’s cultivation had shockingly reached the eighth level celestial deity. Needless to say, his divine power was also divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Divine power burst forth. As the burly young man pushed out his palms, a giant elephant ten thousand meters tall appeared and stomped toward the cold young man.</p><p>“Hmph, he’s just a pretty boy!”</p><p>The cold-looking young man said coldly. His figure suddenly flashed and he rushed out like an eagle.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>Then, the cold-looking young man waved his hand and clawed out.</p><p>His claws were very small compared to the giant elephant, but when the sharp claws grabbed the giant elephant, a terrifying power burst out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The giant elephant’s body exploded.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>what?! the burly young man was shocked. He didn’t expect that his ultimate move would be broken so easily.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After the cold-looking young man defeated the giant elephant, he did not stop. In a flash, he appeared above the burly young man and clawed down.</p><p>The burly young man’s expression changed drastically. He swung his fists with all his might, and the sound of an elephant’s trumpeting could be heard. He wanted to form a giant elephant again to fight against the cold young man.</p><p>However, the power from the cold youth’s claw was extremely sharp and it pierced through the elephant.</p><p>Moreover, the burly young man’s defense was like tofu in the hands of the cold young man.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The cold-looking young man’s claw landed heavily on the burly young man’s shoulder.</p><p>The burly young man let out a blood-curdling screech as the bone armor on his shoulder was broken, and his bones and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Then, the cold-looking young man swung his arm and smashed the burly young man to the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled, and the burly young man screamed. His body bounced up like a ball and then fell back down. He twitched on the ground and was seriously injured.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>The burly young man’s combat strength was definitely not weak. He was at the eighth level of the heavenly deity realm. Among the new recruits of the universal camp, he was definitely above average. However, in the hands of the cold young man, he couldn’t even withstand a single blow.</p><p>Ninth level celestial deity, the other party’s cultivation has already reached ninth level celestial deity!</p><p>it can’t be that the people staying in these courtyards all have ninth level celestial deity cultivation, right? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, many people’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>If the people who stayed here were all at the ninth level heavenly deity realm, then those below the ninth level heavenly deity realm would not be able to challenge them. Wouldn’t that mean that they would have to stay at the foot of the mountain for a very long time?</p><p>When they thought of the stench at the foot of the mountain, many people felt nauseated and almost vomited.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Many people roared in anger, their hearts turning cold.</p><p>“Ninth level celestial deity, is it really as simple as just being a ninth level celestial deity?”</p><p>“You’re really naive.”</p><p>Some of the older members sneered.</p><p>who else wants to challenge me, icehawk? hurry up and make your move. I don’t have that much time to waste with you!</p><p>The cold-looking young man scanned the crowd and said coldly.</p><p>His name was icehawk, and he lived up to his name.</p><p>Many people looked at each other, measuring their own strength, and finally shook their heads helplessly.</p><p>If one’s combat strength couldn’t surpass the burly youth’s, they would only be looking for a beating.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this time, a sonorous voice was heard, and a black-robed young man stepped out.</p><p>This person was carrying a long sword on his back, like a divine sword that had been unsheathed.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he recognized this person. He was one of the four ninth-tier celestial deity prodigies who had attacked the night Demon King at demonic Capital Mountain, a swordsman!</p><p>“It’s Xue Dong, he’s about to make a move!”</p><p>Xue Dong has a ninth level celestial deity cultivation. Furthermore, he’s a sword cultivator. He has the chance to defeat the other party!</p><p>Seeing Xue Dong make his move, some people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>If Xue Dong could defeat the other, it would bring them a lot of hope.</p><p>huhu, an ordinary ninth level celestial deity also wants to defeat icehawk. Truly delusional!</p><p>An old member sneered.</p><p>“Both of you are ninth level heavenly deities, and Xue Dong is a sword cultivator who is known for his attack power. How do you know that Xue Dong can’t defeat icehawk?”</p><p>A new member said unhappily.</p><p>“Ignorant, just watch and you’ll know!”</p><p>The old member said in disdain.</p><p>make your move. Show me your strongest move. Otherwise, you won’t have a chance when I make my move!</p><p>Leng Ying said coldly. Even in front of Xue Dong, his face was still full of contempt.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xue Dong was very direct. He attacked right away. He unsheathed his long sword and a bright and sharp sword light cut through the void, slashing towards Leng Ying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
