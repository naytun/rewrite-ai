They could not figure out Lu Ming’s tricks at all.</p><p>Even Qin wuyou himself was dumbfounded.</p><p>He had already been defeated previously. He never expected that Lu Ming would challenge him now.</p><p>“You … Are you sure you want to challenge Qin wuyou first? Qin wuyou was already defeated before. If you really want to challenge him, don’t say that we broke the rules.”</p><p>Jin Xing said.</p><p>“Don’t worry, it won’t take much effort to deal with him!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>Many people were disdainful. This braggart really didn’t need a draft.</p><p>Qin wuyou was also a Divine Son. His combat strength was similar to that of cangyan pojun. Lu Ming actually said that it would not take much effort to deal with him?</p><p>Who did he think he was? Jin Xing?</p><p>“What is Lu Ming doing?”</p><p>Mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and the others were also puzzled, not knowing what Lu Ming was up to.</p><p>Mo jiuye had fought with Lu Ming two hundred years ago and knew his strength. Lu Ming was only slightly stronger than him. It was possible for him to defeat Qin wuyou, but they didn’t believe that it would take him much effort.</p><p>“I accept this battle!”</p><p>At this moment, Qin wuyou shouted. In a flash, he appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>All he wanted was to kill Lu Ming. Now that Lu Ming was courting death, how could he miss it?</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave him to you!”</p><p>Jin Xing nodded and retreated to the side.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming was only a third-level celestial deity, and Qin wuyou was more than enough.</p><p>you should have recovered by now. I’ll let you make the first move. You won’t have the chance to make a move in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>However, in the eyes of others, he was just acting cool.</p><p>since you’re in a hurry to die, I’ll fulfill your wish. Seven injury divine fist, kill!</p><p>Qin wuyou made his move, and his first move was the seven wounded divine fist.</p><p>In fact, he did not dare to underestimate Lu Ming too much. After all, Qin Wushang and the others had been ruthlessly abused by Lu Ming in the Kong Xuan sect. One must know that Qin Wushang and the others were not weak.</p><p>Therefore, Qin wuyou used his ultimate move right from the start, trying to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move as well. However, he did not activate the battle character to multiply his combat strength or transform into an ancient God Body.</p><p>Ten divine flames burned in his body, and his divine power surged.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and nine ice chains rushed out of his body.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine ice chains were like nine long snakes as they charged toward Qin wuyou.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the power of the ice chain was shocking.</p><p>In particular, there was a special icy liquid in the ninth chain. As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the power of the liquid could be more and more activated.</p><p>Wherever the nine ice chains passed, the temperature in the air dropped sharply, and ice crystals appeared.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Qin wuyou shouted and tried to break the ice chains.</p><p>However, when his fist force collided with the ice chains, his expression changed drastically. He felt an extremely cold intent spreading towards him, and he felt as if all the blood in his body was going to freeze.</p><p>He roared and used his own strength to injure himself to increase the power of the seven injury divine fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After self-mutilating, the power of the seven divine injures fist had indeed increased by a level. The fist radiance brightened, and eight of the nine ice chains shook violently before collapsing.</p><p>However, the ninth ice chain was extremely hard. It broke through the fist force and wrapped around Qin wuyou.</p><p>At the same time, the extreme cold of the ninth ice chain gushed out madly and sealed Qin wuyou in ice. His body froze in mid-air.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the ice chain and swung it up, smashing it heavily on the fighting ring. The fighting ring shook violently. Qin wuyou screamed in pain as dozens of bones in his body were broken. He spat out a large mouthful of blood like a dead fish.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The entire place was deathly silent as they looked at this scene, dumbfounded.</p><p>Many people thought that they were dreaming, or that their eyes were playing tricks on them.</p><p>A Divine Son character, a genius who had fought with the ashen flames breaking Army and suffered heavy losses, was defeated by Lu Ming in one move. This was simply like reading a novel.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Just as everyone was in a daze, Lu Ming picked Qin wuyou up again and smashed him heavily on the fighting ring. Qin wuyou let out a shrill cry. This time, his injuries were even more serious. Like a pool of mud, his eyes rolled back and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>The crowd finally woke up, and then, there was a clamor.</p><p>he won! Lu Ming actually won!</p><p>so powerful! Qin Wushang’s strength is not weaker than the ashen flames Army destroyer, but he was defeated in one move. This is too exaggerated!</p><p>I didn’t expect the Kong Xuan sect to have such a powerful prodigy. I’ve never heard of him before!</p><p>The people of the Qin heaven Starfield, other than being surprised, were also excited.</p><p>They were already in despair, but at this moment, they couldn’t help but have a little hope.</p><p>Of course, it was only a little. After all, Jin Xing was too strong.</p><p>Among them, the most shocked were mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and cangyan pojun.</p><p>Two hundred years ago, mo jiuye had fought with Lu Ming.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than mo jiuye’S. He was on the same level as them.</p><p>But now, Qin wuyou, who had suffered great losses along with grayflame Army breaker, was defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>Did this not mean that Lu Ming’s ability was far above theirs?</p><p>“Third level heavenly deity, his cultivation has broken through to the third level heavenly deity. How is this possible? How could he have broken through two levels in a short two hundred years?”</p><p>Mo jiuye roared in his heart.</p><p>Two hundred years ago, he was well aware that Lu Ming’s cultivation was only at the first-tier celestial deity realm.</p><p>It would take a long time for a sky celestial to break through to the next level. Even if they were peerless geniuses, they would still need a long time.</p><p>Two hundred years was too short.</p><p>Unless he had a great fortuitous encounter.</p><p>“He must have had a fortuitous encounter all these years. Damn it!”</p><p>Mo jiuye and sword Dao Wuji roared in their hearts. They were extremely jealous.</p><p>“I’ve lost, put me down!”</p><p>Qin wuyou roared.</p><p>“You’re too naïve to think that I’ll let you down just because I lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently and looked at ice fairy,”This guy killed one of you. Today, I’ll exchange his life for another!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin wuyou was scared out of his wits. He struggled madly, but he was frozen by the ice chains. How could he struggle?</p><p>no, you can’t kill me! You can’t! Help me! he shouted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>On the other side, Jin Xing also shouted and rushed toward Lu Ming, wanting to save Qin wuyou.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance.</p><p>A powerful force rushed into Qin wuyou’s body through the ice chains.</p><p>Qin wuyou let out an unreconciled scream as his body was torn into pieces and he died on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
