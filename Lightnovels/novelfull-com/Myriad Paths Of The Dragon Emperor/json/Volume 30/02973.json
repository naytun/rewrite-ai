Therefore, there were no cities on this planet.</p><p>In the vast territory, all kinds of buildings could be built wherever one wanted, and they could cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were flying at a high altitude. They looked up and realized that the entire planet had mountains, lakes, and rivers. There was everything one could think of. Moreover, there were various buildings in between the mountains, lakes, and rivers.</p><p>“The woo family’s headquarters is on this planet?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“You can say that, but it’s not very accurate!”</p><p>“Actually, in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, there are many large aristocratic families with long inheritances, such as our Wu family and the Qin family where Qin wuyou and the others were born!”</p><p>these big aristocratic families all have powerhouses holding positions in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Therefore, their headquarters are all set up on this planet!</p><p>however, most of the ancestral lands of the macro worlds are not here. They are scattered in different star fields, which are the foundations of the big families!</p><p>for example, although the woo family’s headquarters is here, our ancestral land is in another star area, where most of the woo family’s powerhouses are gathered!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and roughly understood.</p><p>Not long after, an endless mountain range appeared before their eyes.</p><p>There were countless buildings built on these mountains, and one could not see the end of them.</p><p>This was the woo family’s headquarters in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Let’s go, you guys can stay at the Wu residence for now!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>Everyone flew forward.</p><p>“Third young master!”</p><p>“Greetings, third young master!”</p><p>On the way, many people saluted Wu Zifeng.</p><p>Although Wu Zifeng’s cultivation was not very high, he was the son of the current Wu family’s patriarch, so his status was very high.</p><p>After entering the Wu family, Wu Zifeng arranged a courtyard for Lu Ming and Qiu Yue to stay in.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue had been at the Wu family for three days.</p><p>On this day, Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong went to look for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother Lu, I have a favor to ask of you!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Brother Wu, if you have something to say, just say it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, are you selling that demon master token?”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Demon master token? Why? You need it? If you need it, just take it. Qiu Yue and I only need two!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had three demon master tokens and one Demon King token on him. Two were enough for him and Qiu Yue to enter the universal camp, and the two extra were useless.</p><p>He had originally wanted to give it to Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong, but their cultivation had not reached the heavenly God Realm, so they could not use it.</p><p>it’s like this, I have two cousins who also participated in this time’s universal camp assessment. However, their luck was rather bad and they didn’t manage to complete the assessment. Hence, they would like to purchase two Demon Lord tokens from you!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“The Wu family also participated in the universal camp’s assessment? Why didn’t I see him on Mount Shanghai?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>the Magic City mountain assessment is just one of the assessments in the universal camp. In fact, there are many geniuses who want to join the universal camp each time. The assessment is also divided into many categories and they are all randomly selected. Some people will get this kind of assessment while others will get that kind of assessment. Those who head to Magic City mountain are only a small portion of the assessment in the universal camp!</p><p>Wu Zifeng explained.</p><p>Lu Ming had a sudden realization. So that was the case!</p><p>It seemed that Wu Zifeng’s two cousins had taken part in other assessments and did not complete them.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, having an extra demon master token is useless. If your cousin needs it, then just give it to them!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then I’ll thank you in advance. I’ll call my two cousins over!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng was overjoyed and left Lu Ming’s courtyard. Not long after, Wu Zifeng came with two young men.</p><p>The two young men looked like they were in their twenties. They were tall, burly, and handsome.</p><p>“Wu Ming!”</p><p>“Wuyue!”</p><p>“Greetings, brother Lu!”</p><p>The two young men cupped their fists at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re too polite, brother. There’s no need to be so polite. I heard that you two brothers need demon master tokens, so I have two extra here. Here!”</p><p>Two demon master tokens appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. With a wave of his hand, they flew toward Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue reached out to receive it and revealed a look of great joy.</p><p>brother Lu, how many divine crystals does the demon master token cost? we’ll buy it!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>since you are Zifeng’s brothers, you are also my brothers. We are all brothers, so there is no need to be so polite. I have no use for these two demon master tokens. You can just take them. There is no need to buy them!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Then this … How can we do that!”</p><p>Wuyue hesitated.</p><p>“Brother woo, unless you look down on me and are unwilling to be friends with me …”</p><p>Lu Ming deliberately sighed.</p><p>brother Lu, you’ve misunderstood us. We’ve heard from Zifeng that you’re an unparalleled heaven’s favorite. We’ve wanted to be friends with you for a long time. How could we look down on you? ”</p><p>“That’s right. In that case, we’ll take this demon master token!”</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue quickly said.</p><p>“My two brothers woo, when do you plan to go to the universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic and asked.</p><p>there’s still seven more days before we report to the star sky Camp. How about we go together then? ”</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Just what I wanted!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>They were all young people and got to know each other very quickly. They took out some fine wine and chatted as they drank. Lu Ming had a better understanding of the situation in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, Wu Zifeng and the others took their leave.</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue stayed at the Wu residence.</p><p>They did not know that two black-robed men were pacing back and forth in the distance.</p><p>“What do we do? They’ve entered the woo residence!”</p><p>The Wu family was extremely powerful. Since Lu Ming and the rest had entered the Wu family, they could do nothing about it.</p><p>they can’t possibly stay in the woo family forever. They’ve obtained the devil King and devil Lord’s tokens, so they’ll most likely join the universal camp. We’ll make the necessary preparations on the way to the universal camp and kill them in one fell swoop!</p><p>The other black-robed man said coldly.</p><p>The two of them observed for a while more before they left in a flash.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was cultivating that day.</p><p>These days, he had been cultivating the Saint-grade divine skill that he had obtained from the night Demon King.</p><p>The last time on Magic City mountain, Lu Ming had forcefully tried to break through to the fourth-level celestial deity realm, causing his Foundation to be unstable.</p><p>In the following period of time, it would be impossible for Lu Ming to break through. He could only Polish his Foundation first. Only when his Foundation was stable could he continue to break through to the next realm.</p><p>While he was polishing his Foundation, Lu Ming could cultivate his new divine technique.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s wrist emitted a series of wonderful fluctuations.</p><p>This fluctuation came from QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu had turned into a bangle and was wearing it on Lu Ming’s wrist. It had been in deep sleep for hundreds of years and there was no movement. Now, there was finally movement.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
