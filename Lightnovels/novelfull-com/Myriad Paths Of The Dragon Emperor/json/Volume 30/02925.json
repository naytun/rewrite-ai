BOOM!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s sharp claws continued to claw at the fist print, causing a series of rumbles. The fist print trembled continuously, and cracks appeared on it.</p><p>“How is that possible? How is that possible?”</p><p>Qin Wushang howled in his heart. He was in disbelief.</p><p>He had already used all his strength and used his ultimate move, but now, he was still at a disadvantage. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>He was a sixth-level celestial deity and had even mastered the divine energy while Lu Ming was only a first-level celestial deity.</p><p>An existence that he had regarded as an ant had actually exploded with such shocking battle prowess. It was a huge blow to his self-esteem.</p><p>“I can’t lose. How can I lose to an ant from the Qin heaven star system? seven injury divine fist, seven injury stacking!”</p><p>Qin Wushang roared in his heart. His face turned pale and he spat out a few mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>After spurting out blood, Qin Wushang’s face turned pale. However, the force of his fist had become even stronger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Qin Wushang continued to swing his fists. Waves of terrifying fist force burst out continuously and merged with the fist seals from before, causing the power of his fist seals to skyrocket and emit a dazzling radiance.</p><p>“Using his own injuries to increase his attack power, what a brainless secret technique, hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and then took a step forward.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon, come out!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s roars continued to ring out in the sky. Four more Dragon’s roars were heard in a row. Then, four nine-clawed divine Dragons emerged above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>In addition to the previous one, there were a total of six nine-clawed divine Dragons.</p><p>After more than two hundred years of cultivation, Lu Ming had already cultivated six Divine Dragon images. The true power of the divine Dragon materialization art was gradually revealed.</p><p>The six nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced at Qin Wushang together. The vast Dragon might caused the nine divine Dragons pulling the Qin family’s carriage to show fear and retreat continuously.</p><p>This was a suppression due to the difference in levels. In the divine Dragon clan, the nine-clawed Divine Dragon was undoubtedly superior.</p><p>The power of the six nine-clawed divine Dragons was amazing.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had mastered the battle formula. Even if he did not trigger the multifold increase in combat power, he could be enhanced by the battle formula when he cast any divine skill or secret skill. The power would be stronger.</p><p>The attacks from both sides met in the void and an astonishing collision broke out. Then, Qin Wushang’s fist seal continued to explode and shatter.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Qin Wushang spat out a large mouthful of blood as he retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. The six nine-clawed divine Dragons roared and chased after him.</p><p>“Hurry, hurry and help me! Let’s suppress this ant together!” He shouted.</p><p>Qin Wushang roared. Even now, he still felt that he was superior to Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a common problem for those who were born in great forces.</p><p>It was just like how the Qin heaven star region’s geniuses would act the same when facing the people of the chaotic astral River. They would look down on the people of the chaotic astral River, feeling that they were high and mighty, with a noble status.</p><p>As for those who had walked up from the bottom, they would not have such a mentality.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were five other young men who came with Qin Wushang. At this moment, all of them were charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The moment the five young men attacked, the people from the Kong Xuan sect were shocked.</p><p>This was because these five young men were all terrifying heaven’s favorites.</p><p>They had all mastered the divine power. Three of them were at the sixth level and two of them were at the fifth level.</p><p>The strength of those three sixth level heavenly deities was not the slightest bit weaker than Qin Wushang’s.</p><p>The six experts joined forces and launched their own ultimate moves, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>die, brat! Seven injury divine fist!</p><p>Qin Wushang roared. He had been injured by Lu Ming, but the power of his fist force had become stronger.</p><p>What he cultivated was a secret skill unique to the Qin family. The more injured he was, the more powerful his fist force would be.</p><p>However, in the face of such an attack, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm.</p><p>“Battle formula, double the combat power!”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming activated the double combat strength of the battle character formula. A powerful force burst out from his body and filled his entire body.</p><p>The six nine-clawed divine Dragons let out a long roar. As their bodies twisted, they swelled up rapidly. Their bodies grew larger and their power became stronger.</p><p>The six nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced toward the six young men.</p><p>A spear as huge as a mountain materialized in Lu Ming’s palm and he thrust it at one of the youths.</p><p>The young man was fighting against a nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma laksana with all his strength. He could not resist the attack of the long spear at all. He was pressed down by the spear light and flew out like a broken sandbag. He was severely injured and his breath was weak.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming fired another shot at another young man.</p><p>After Lu Ming had activated the double combat strength, trash like Qin Wushang was no longer Lu Ming’s match. He was easily crushed.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming attacked continuously with his spear. Each spear attack could suppress one person.</p><p>In an instant, the five young men who attacked from behind were all sent flying by Lu Ming and were severely injured.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept towards Qin Wushang.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Qin Wushang was so frightened that he screamed, turned around, and ran.</p><p>“You haven’t even knelt down and you want to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He controlled the six divine Dragons and surrounded Qin Wushang.</p><p>“Brat, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a burly man from the Qin family shouted and stepped forward. He wanted to deal with Lu Ming personally.</p><p>However, a burly man from the woo family stopped him.</p><p>let the younger generation settle their own matters. It’s better for the older generation not to interfere!</p><p>The burly man from the woo family sneered.</p><p>This sentence was said by the Qin family’s burly man before, but now, the Wu family’s burly man returned it to him without moving.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The burly man from the Qin family was furious. He then glared at Lu Ming and said coldly, Qin Wushang is a disciple of the Qin clan. Although he is not a core disciple, you want him to kneel? you have to think carefully whether you are worthy of it!</p><p>His voice was cold and threatening.</p><p>Even if Qin Wushang was not a core member of the Qin clan, he was still a member of the clan. He represented the face of the clan. If Qin Wushang were to kneel, it would be equivalent to slapping the face of the clan.</p><p>I’ve never heard of the Qin family. I only know that if you want someone to pay, you have to be prepared to pay. If he wants me to kneel, then you have to be prepared to kneel. Kneel!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, not giving him any face at all.</p><p>The six nine-clawed divine Dragons ‘huge claws pressed down continuously.</p><p>How could Qin Wushang withstand it? he barely managed to withstand a few moves before he was controlled by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon. With a plop, he knelt in the air before Lu Ming.</p><p>‘</p><p>Qin Wushang let out an angry roar that sounded like a pig being slaughtered.</p><p>This was truly a great humiliation.</p><p>In the Qin family, he was not a core disciple to begin with, so he was not doing very well. If this matter were to spread to the Qin family, he would probably do even worse and become the Qin family’s disgrace.</p><p>At this moment, he even wanted to die.</p><p>The other five young men of the Qin family were pale with fear. They were glad that they weren’t the first ones to step out. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have a good ending.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
