At the same time, hundreds of general demonic guards stepped out and charged at Lu Ming, launching attacks at him.</p><p>In their eyes, only Lu Ming posed a threat. Wu Zifeng and the rest were not a threat.</p><p>“You brought this upon yourself, you can’t live!”</p><p>I’ll go, ” Lu Ming said indifferently. Ten divine fires burned in his dantian. Ten types of divine power gathered together and surged toward Lu Ming’s arm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fists continuously, and nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced out one after another.</p><p>A total of six nine-clawed divine Dragons stomped with their claws and destroyed all The Fiend guards ‘attacks. Then, they continued to pounce at them. The Dragon claws that were as large as mountains clawed at them.</p><p>“Ah, not good!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Hundreds of general fiend guards screamed in fear and tried to Dodge, but it was too late.</p><p>As the Dragon Claw swiped down, regardless of whether it was a first level, second level, or third level celestial deity, they all exploded, their bodies and spirits destroyed.</p><p>With a single move, over a hundred general fiend guards were annihilated.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard from all around.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming’s combat strength to be so powerful.</p><p>“Damn it, quickly lay down the demon general formation!”</p><p>The general of the general fiend guards was extremely shocked. He then roared and gathered the general fiend guards to set up a large array to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give him the chance.</p><p>“Break the air …”</p><p>A cold voice rang out as a dazzling spear light shot toward the general of The Fiend guard.</p><p>This move had already triggered the double combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>The general of the general fiend guard was unable to block it at all. The spear radiance pierced through the space between his eyebrows and his body fell to the ground.</p><p>“The general is dead!”</p><p>With the death of the general of the general mo guards, the thousands of general mo guards immediately fell into chaos and fled in all directions like ants on a hot pan.</p><p>“Steady!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud shout came from the sky, and an extremely powerful aura filled the air.</p><p>how dare you cause trouble in my general Devil City? you don’t know what’s good for you. Kill!</p><p>Another angry roar was heard in the sky. Then, a figure rushed toward Lu Ming. Before the figure even arrived, a black palm print was already blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eighth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. The moment the other party attacked, Lu Ming could sense the cultivation of the person who attacked.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and rushed up. A beam of spear light as large as a mountain soared into the sky and pierced toward the palm print.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the palm print collided with a deafening boom. The sky trembled violently and the force spread in all directions.</p><p>Then, the spear light and the palm print disappeared.</p><p>In the next moment, a middle-aged man in a purple robe appeared in the sky. He was thin, but his aura was like a mountain.</p><p>“City Lord, it’s the city Lord!”</p><p>“We pay our respects to the city Lord!”</p><p>Seeing the purple-robed middle-aged man, The Fiend guard calmed down and saluted him.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>The purple-robed middle-aged man waved his hand and spoke indifferently. His voice was filled with dignity.</p><p>Immediately, thousands of general fiend guards moved and set up a formation, waiting for their arrival.</p><p>However, the purple-robed middle-aged man’s cold gaze was fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>it’s been a long time since anyone dared to kill my general fiend guards in my general fiend city. You will pay a heavy price for this!</p><p>The city Lord of the devil-general city said coldly.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to ask me why I killed him?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I don’t need to know why you killed them. I only know that you killed the people of my devil general city. That’s enough!</p><p>The city Lord’s voice became even colder.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he charged towards Lu Ming. His eighth-tier celestial deity cultivation erupted with all his might. The terrifying palm force pressed down on Lu Ming like an avalanche.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. The other party had attacked Lu Ming without asking for the reason. This had infuriated Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming triggered the tripled combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled and a mountain-like spear radiance swept across the void.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear radiance and the pitch-black palm print collided continuously. In an instant, the two of them had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Break, moon-cutting!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. He held the spear with both hands and slashed down. A huge crescent-shaped spear radiance slashed forward violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The city Lord’s palm print was shattered one after another.</p><p>Jiang mo Cheng’s expression changed drastically. He retreated 10000 meters before he could stabilize his body. His face was a little pale.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>The surrounding people and the general fiend guards were all shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation base was merely at the third-tier celestial deity realm, but his combat strength was actually so powerful that he could actually force the general Demon city’s city Lord to retreat.</p><p>“Could this person be a peerless heaven’s favorite from the outside?”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord himself was also extremely shocked.</p><p>Other than a peerless heaven’s favorite from the outside world, no one else could have such strong battle prowess.</p><p>“Hmph, so what if he’s an outsider? he’ll have to pay the price for killing my fiend general guard!”</p><p>The eyes of the general Devil city’s city Lord turned cold.</p><p>kid, you’re quite capable, but if that’s all you’re capable of, you’ll still die. Devil soul curse!</p><p>The general Demon city’s city Lord shouted. Runes suddenly appeared on his body. These runes formed a kind of curse seal, which was similar to the dark Dragon blood Curse that Lu Ming had been afflicted with.</p><p>However, these curse marks covered the general Demon city’s city Lord’s entire body like demons.</p><p>The city Lord of the devil-general city revealed a pained expression.</p><p>However, his aura had skyrocketed.</p><p>He rose to the ninth level celestial deity realm in one go.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>The general Demon city’s City Master roared in anger and charged at Lu Ming. His claws turned into demonic claws, sharper than divine artifacts, and he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming continuously cast the first move of the three apocalyptic strikes,’space-piercing’. Rays of spear light bloomed from Lu Ming’s hands, filling the void and charging toward the city Master of general Demon City.</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows once again, but this time, they were evenly matched.</p><p>The two of them continued to fight in the air. They exchanged dozens of moves in a row, and neither of them could do anything to the other.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation base, even if he did not use the ancient God Body, the activation of the battle character formula would triple his combat power. It would be enough to fight against a ninth-level celestial deity.</p><p>“How is this kid so strong?”</p><p>The city Lord of general Devil City was more and more shocked.</p><p>At that moment, a purple-robed young man appeared not far away.</p><p>“Young city Lord!”</p><p>Many general fiend guards saluted the young man.</p><p>This man was the young city Lord of general Devil City, Yan Zhi.</p><p>Yan Zhi was also staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>a third level heavenly deity actually has such powerful battle prowess …</p><p>Yan Zhi murmured, his eyes full of jealousy. But the next moment, he turned his eyes and the jealousy disappeared, as if he was thinking.</p><p>“Father, stop!”</p><p>After that, Yan Zhi sent a message to the general Demon city’s city Lord.</p><p>“Stop?”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. Stop and make peace with this person. This person’s talent is astonishing. Perhaps we can use him to help us take back the spirit Lake!</p><p>Yan Zhi continued.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
