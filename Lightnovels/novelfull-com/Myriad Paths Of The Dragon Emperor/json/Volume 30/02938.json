His decisiveness was truly shocking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you … You … You actually dared to kill the pride of my Qin clan. You’re courting death, courting death …”</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s paragons roared and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming ignored him. He looked at ice fairy and said, ” a life for a life. I’ll help you take back the life of the brother from the ice Soul Clan!</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Ice immortal cupped her fists and thanked him sincerely.</p><p>To be honest, he also wanted to kill Qin wuyou, but he didn’t have the chance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the fighting ring shook. Jin Xing landed on the fighting ring, and his body burst out with a dazzling golden light.</p><p>His long hair fluttered in the wind, and his aura was imposing. His eyes were cold as he stared at Lu Ming and said,”Lu Ming, right? very good. Your abilities have exceeded my expectations. Now, I’ll be your opponent!”</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted again.</p><p>Jin Xing was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. He stared at Lu Ming with sinister eyes and said,”What do you want now?”</p><p>it’s nothing. I just feel that you’re no match for me alone. Call a few more and come at me together!</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>What?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened as they thought they had heard wrong!</p><p>Lu Ming actually complained that Jin Xing was not his opponent and wanted to call a few more opponents to attack him together?</p><p>Arrogant, presumptuous.</p><p>Previously, Jin Xing was already arrogant enough when he asked the ice immortal and the red flame demonic pine to attack together. However, Lu Ming was even more arrogant now.</p><p>The combat power that Jin Xing had displayed just now was obvious to all. It was extremely shocking and terrifying. Lu Ming actually despised Jin Xing for not having enough strength?</p><p>Although Lu Ming had easily defeated Qin wuyou, Qin wuyou could not compare to Jin Xing. Although the two of them had the same cultivation, Jin Xing could probably defeat Qin wuyou in one move.</p><p>how arrogant! I don’t need anyone else to deal with you. Let me see what you’re capable of!</p><p>“Stop!” Jin Xing coldly shouted as the golden light around his body became even more dazzling.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Jin Xing took a few steps forward and arrived in front of Lu Ming. He slashed his Golden Palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm had yet to reach him, but the terrifying force was already surging toward Lu Ming, erupting with a terrifying cutting force.</p><p>If it were an ordinary third level celestial deity existence, they would probably be torn apart by this terrifying force directly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was no ordinary third-level celestial deity.</p><p>His combat strength was God knows how many times stronger than ordinary third level celestial deities.</p><p>&Nbsp; the ten divine flames in his body surged, and ten powerful divine powers gathered together and charged.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming triggered the fourfold increase in combat strength of the battle formula. His combat strength soared wildly.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the divine Dragon materialization art and threw a punch. The surging divine power surged toward Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out from Lu Ming’s fist. The nine dragon claws grabbed at Jin Xing in succession and collided with Jin Xing’s Golden Palm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Nine consecutive explosions were heard. The force that erupted from the point of collision swept in all directions like a Gale.</p><p>“Void severing hand, break everything, kill!”</p><p>die! Jin Xing coldly shouted. The light on his palm grew even brighter.</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon shook violently before it exploded.</p><p>Jin Xing’s long hair fluttered in the wind, and his aura was wild. He shouted,”Is this what gives you the right to be arrogant? What a disappointment, lose!”</p><p>With that, Jin Xing struck his palm at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Then, again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s faint voice was heard and he punched out with both fists.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars were heard continuously. With every punch that Lu Ming threw, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon would fly out.</p><p>Six nine-clawed divine Dragons flew toward Jin Xing one after another and launched violent attacks.</p><p>Jin Xing’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>Previously, he had only used one palm. Now, he was using the second.</p><p>Two Golden Palms flew out and attacked the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>Jin Xing’s void-breaking hand looked very ordinary. When he attacked, there was no strange phenomenon. However, its power was indeed astonishing. It was said to have the ability to break the void.</p><p>Every time it collided with the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, it would shake the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>The two people’s intense confrontation soon exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>The people around them were stunned.</p><p>They had never expected that Lu Ming could really fight Jin Xing.</p><p>Previously, many people thought that Lu Ming was bragging. Now, it seemed that Lu Ming was really capable, although it was still a little boastful that he wanted to challenge many people at the same time.</p><p>“This person’s battle power is very strong!”</p><p>At this moment, the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the elders who had come with them all revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>a third-level celestial deity can actually resist Jin Xing’s void shattering hand. Even the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion has never seen such a monstrous talent before!</p><p>An old man sighed.</p><p>A third level celestial deity able to battle Jin Xing was truly too terrifying.</p><p>Jin Xing himself was also a peerless heaven’s favorite. Although he was only a sixth level heavenly deity, it was easy for him to kill ordinary ninth level heavenly deities.</p><p>But for a third level celestial deity to have such powerful battle strength, it was truly unheard of.</p><p>I’m afraid only the core of the sacred dynasty would have such a monster!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, another old man also sighed.</p><p>A tiny little Qin Tian Starfield actually produced such a heaven’s favorite. It truly exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming cast the ice chains. Nine chains wrapped around Jin Xing, exuding a shocking chill.</p><p>“Void-breaking sword!”</p><p>Jin Xing said coldly. A golden light shot out from between his eyebrows, and a golden combat sword flew out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The golden sword slashed down and cut off two ice chains. Then, it slashed again and cut off a few more ice chains.</p><p>In the end, only the ninth ice chain could fight with the other party.</p><p>“Very good, Lu Ming. I didn’t expect you to force me to this point. It’s your honor to be able to see my ultimate move next!”</p><p>“Break through the ages!”</p><p>Jin Xing roared. The Golden combat sword flew toward him and was caught in his hand.</p><p>However, Jin Xing didn’t intend to attack with his sword. After Jin Xing grabbed it, the sword actually melted into a pool of golden liquid and integrated with his palm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jin Xing’s hands came together and chopped down.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>An extremely terrifying golden light burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. With a thought, the six nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma forms pounced at Jin Xing.</p><p>However, the golden light was truly terrifying.</p><p>When the first nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma power collided with the golden light, the Dragon Claw collapsed, and then the Dragon body was split into two.</p><p>Then, there was a second one, a third one …</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
