How could he dare to continue fighting? if he continued, he would only be abused.</p><p>Hearing that su mu had admitted defeat, Lu Ming did not continue to pursue him.</p><p>He had no enmity with su mu, so all he had to do was defeat him.</p><p>Su mu landed on the fighting stage and cupped his fists: many thanks. Third level celestial deity actually has such powerful strength. Admirable!</p><p>After saying that, su MU’s figure flashed and he rushed down the fighting stage.</p><p>Lu Ming had won this battle!</p><p>“This kid’s battle strength is truly astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated su mu, causing Pei Lin and the rest to look solemn.</p><p>The duel continued.</p><p>The people who were going to fight next were all people with high cultivation and shocking strength.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh. After leaving the Qin heaven Star Zone and entering the Chu heaven Star Zone, it seemed that the geniuses he met all controlled divine-grade divine energy.</p><p>It was as if divine-grade divine power had become the standard of whether or not one was a heaven’s favorite. Sacred-grade divine power was simply not enough.</p><p>The intense battle went on for three days.</p><p>In the end, Pei Lin, sorcerer blood, night rose, a bald young man, and Lu Ming made it into the top five.</p><p>After that, it was the battle between the top five.</p><p>In this battle, night Devil King announced that night rose would not get a bye.</p><p>It would be a battle between Lu Ming, Pei Lin, Wu Xue, and the bald young man.</p><p>The others had no objections.</p><p>The goal of those who had made it this far was to be first.</p><p>Therefore, it didn’t matter who got a bye.</p><p>“The first round, Lu Ming, Pei Lin!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>Lu Ming and Pei Lin leaped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The two of them didn’t waste any words and immediately started fighting.</p><p>Pei Lin’s strength was very strong, even stronger than su mu, he had reached the 8th level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming had to transform into a green-armored ancient God to defeat Pei Lin.</p><p>damn it, how could this kid’s strength be so amazing? he didn’t even use his full strength when he was fighting su mu!</p><p>Among all the people present, the one who was the most annoyed was the witch Blood.</p><p>Previously, he had declared that he would kill Lu Ming. However, he was less and less confident now.</p><p>Then, the Sorcerer’s blood fought against the bald young man.</p><p>The battle between the two was very strange. The Sorcerer’s blood emitted a bloody mist that covered the fighting ring. The bald young man seemed to be unable to exert his full strength at all. He could only exert 60 – 70% of his full strength. He was easily defeated by the Sorcerer’s blood.</p><p>“Kid, it’s your turn next!”</p><p>After the witch’s blood defeated the bald young man, it shot Lu Ming a provocative look.</p><p>“It also attacks the soul?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Obviously, the way the witch Blood attacked was very similar to that of the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm. It could also directly attack the soul. Therefore, his opponent could not exert 100% of his strength.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not afraid of such an attack at all because he had the measure formula.</p><p>With that, the top three would be decided.</p><p>next, the night rose will still have a bye. Lu Ming and the witch Blood will fight. The winner will be able to challenge the night rose. After defeating the night rose, he will be the champion of this great battle in Magic City. If he can date my daughter, he will also be able to get ten pounds of demon night spring!</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>This made many people jealous.</p><p>10 catties of demon night spring, and he could still get a stunner like the night rose. It would be strange if he wasn’t jealous.</p><p>Especially some young men, who kept glancing at the sensitive parts of the night rose. Their bodies were hot, and some parts of their bodies were already restless.</p><p>He had no choice, the night rose was too tempting.</p><p>“Kid, come!”</p><p>Wu Xue rushed up to the fighting ring and looked at Lu Ming with a ferocious look.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He took a step forward and leaped onto the fighting ring, appearing to be at ease.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment Lu Ming leaped onto the fighting ring, the Sorcerer’s blood was used.</p><p>Wu Xue’s entire body turned as red as blood. Blood-red mist kept spurting out of the pores of his body. Suddenly, the entire fighting ring was shrouded in the blood-red mist.</p><p>Unable to avoid it, Lu Ming was enveloped by the blood-red mist.</p><p>The blood-red mist seemed to have a mind of its own as it rushed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine energy. Ten types of divine energy enveloped his body to resist the blood-red mist.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The blood-red mist was very similar to the mist of the woman with the snake wrapped in her arm. Lu Ming used ten types of divine powers to block it, but he could not block much. Most of the mist rushed into Lu Ming’s body and rushed toward his soul in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>“Leave it to me …”</p><p>The sound of the ” quantity ” formula rang out, and a devouring power erupted, devouring all the mist.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he just stood there, not moving.</p><p>Junior Sister Lian said that this kid is extremely strange. The divine Qi seems to be ineffective on him, but I don’t believe it. It’s not effective at all. Maybe Junior sister’s cultivation is too low. Continue, continue!</p><p>Wu Xue roared in his heart and madly circulated his divine power. His divine power was transformed into refined divine Qi through a special cultivation technique and gushed out continuously. The mist on the fighting ring became thicker and thicker, until it was almost pitch-black.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body swayed, as if he could not take it anymore.</p><p>“This brat is finally unable to hold on!”</p><p>The Sorcerer’s blood was overjoyed. He shook his arms, and the two large snakes on his arms slithered toward Lu Ming silently.</p><p>As they neared Lu Ming, the two giant snakes suddenly expanded and turned into two giant pythons. They pounced at Lu Ming and spat out two streams of poisonous gas.</p><p>Before the poisonous gas arrived, a nauseating smell filled the air.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and the corners of his lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>With a thought, nine ice chains flew out from his body.</p><p>A bone-piercing chill filled the air, and layers of ice crystals appeared in the air. The poisonous gas spewed out by the two pythons was also frozen.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The nine ice chains wrapped around the two giant pythons, and the coldness seeped into the bodies of the giant pythons, freezing them.</p><p>The two giant pythons writhed and struggled crazily.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Wu Xue’s expression changed drastically. He took a step forward and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming let out a loud roar and transformed into his ancient God Body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still held back and only transformed into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear vibrated and swept out, sweeping across the bodies of the two giant pythons. The two giant pythons screamed in pain and their bodies exploded, dying on the spot.</p><p>“Ah, damn it, I want you to die!”</p><p>Wu Xue roared and waved his hands. The mist on the fighting ring rolled up crazily and turned into two evil ghosts, which charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, this kind of fog was completely useless against Lu Ming. He ignored the fog and waved his spear at the witch’s blood.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear struck out.</p><p>“Blood-red palm!”</p><p>Wu Xue had also used his ultimate move. His body turned even redder, and it seemed as if blood was flowing on the surface of his skin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
