The night rose actually used all means to seduce Lu Ming, as if they wanted to rape him on the spot. Fortunately, Lu Ming was mentally strong and managed to resist the temptation.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming instinctively felt a deep sense of danger from the night rose.</p><p>This sense of danger caused his mind to tremble.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that the night rose seemed to want to eat him.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming calmed down.</p><p>“Lu Ming, can you not leave tonight?”</p><p>After her actions were ineffective against Lu Ming, night rose spoke again. Even a fool could understand what she meant.</p><p>Any normal man would not be able to resist such temptation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had completely calmed down. He felt that the sense of danger coming from the dark rose was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he couldn’t resist the temptation and really had sex with the night rose, he would probably die.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly as he thought of a countermeasure.</p><p>Night Rose’s small hands were already moving around Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the small hand of the night rose.

Lu Ming calmed down completely.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power and shook it slightly. He pushed the dark rose away and moved to a stone bench at the side.”Miss Rose, I’m a traditional person. Before I fully understand it, I will not have sex with any woman. Please forgive me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, putting on the look of a gentleman.</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>Night rose secretly gritted her teeth and secretly despised him in her heart. She didn’t expect that he would still have such stubborn thoughts.</p><p>Forcing out a smile, dark rose said, ” brother Lu, please don’t misunderstand me. I was just testing you. Brother Lu, you’re indeed a gentleman. I’m impressed. Come on, let’s continue drinking!</p><p>“PAH!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt contempt in his heart.
