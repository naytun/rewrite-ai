His face was extremely cold.</p><p>kid, you have guts. I hope you don’t set foot in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion for the rest of your life. Otherwise, you will regret what you have done today. Go!</p><p>The Qin clan’s burly man left these words and flew onto the chariot with Qin Wushang and the others.</p><p>Then, the nine divine Dragons roared and pulled the chariot away, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Yue Wuya and the others let out a long breath, but their hearts were still very heavy, as if a huge stone was pressing down on them.</p><p>Although the Kong Xuan sect was temporarily safe, they knew that this matter was far from over.</p><p>The treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion had been stolen. This was definitely a huge matter.</p><p>They immediately welcomed Wu Zifeng and the Wu family into the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>After some understanding, Lu Ming knew that when Yue Wuya was young and adventuring, he had inadvertently befriended Wu Zifeng’s grandfather. The two of them had gone on adventures together and had a life-and-death friendship.</p><p>Later on, Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng were betrothed even before they were born. That was why Wu Zifeng often went to the Kong Xuan sect, and Yue Linglong often went to the Wu family to play.</p><p>“Zifeng, what’s going on?”</p><p>In a large hall, Yue Wuya asked Wu Zifeng.</p><p>I’m not too sure about the details. I only know that a few months ago, the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the nine absolute God crystal, was stolen. The thief was very smart and no one found out!</p><p>however, the other party still left behind traces. The experts of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion came to a conclusion based on those traces. The person who stole the treasure is very likely to come from the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“How is this possible? The defense of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is so well hidden and there are so many experts. In the Qin heaven star field, who could steal the treasure from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya and the others could not believe it.</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, a third level Godking like the demoness of the unique demon Academy, Xing mo, was already considered a peak expert. However, such a cultivation base was far from enough in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Not to mention the third level of the Godking realm, even the fourth or fifth level of the Godking realm was far from enough.</p><p>Who in the Qin heaven Starfield had the ability to steal the precious treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor?</p><p>I’m also very confused about this. However, since the clues point here, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion will definitely not give up. This time, not only did the Qin family send people, but the other aristocratic families also sent people over!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>Everyone’s expression became even more serious. This matter was not simple at all.</p><p>The crowd chatted for a while more before dispersing.</p><p>As expected, a few days later, news after news spread in the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, people from all the major families had come. Not only had Kong Xuan sect been visited, but all the major forces in the Qin heaven Starfield had also been visited.</p><p>For example, the three Overlord forces, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>The people from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor were domineering. No matter which power they were from, they wanted to check their storage rings and dantian sea of consciousness.</p><p>The other powers were not like the Kong Xuan sect, who had the help of the Wu family. When faced with the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, all the other powers were helpless and could only obediently accept it. Their storage rings and dantian sea of consciousness were checked.</p><p>Even the red flame clan and the ice Soul Clan were no exception.</p><p>But the result was that nothing was found.</p><p>There was not a single clue about the nine absolute God crystal.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s people were furious. They gave the Qin heaven star field ten years. After ten years, if they still didn’t hand over the nine absolute divine crystals, they would send an Army over and trample the Qin heaven star field.</p><p>For a time, the people of the Qin heaven Starfield were in a state of panic, and everyone was in danger.</p><p>who stole the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor? why isn’t he handing it over? is he trying to kill everyone? ”</p><p>“Which goddamned bastard harmed the entire star field for his own selfish reasons? he’s going to die a horrible death!”</p><p>Many people cursed.</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, a storm was brewing, but there was nothing.</p><p>Not long after, another piece of news spread throughout the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>During this period of time, the paragons of the various major forces of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had entered the Qin heaven Starfield one after another.</p><p>There were even geniuses who set up an arena on myriad spirit planet to challenge the geniuses of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>The result was naturally that the Qin heaven Starfield’s geniuses were crushed and didn’t obtain a single victory.</p><p>“An ant is an ant, truly incompetent!”</p><p>what heaven’s favorites? they’re all trash!</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon was incomparably powerful, depreciating the Qin Tian Starfield’s Paragon to be worthless.</p><p>Some people were furious and went to challenge the geniuses of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. However, the result was already set in stone. No one would win.</p><p>This made the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion even more arrogant.</p><p>if the younger generation of the Qin heaven Starfield can defeat us, we can extend the time limit to a hundred years, a thousand years, or even more!</p><p>In the end, some of the geniuses from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion said.</p><p>This moved the hearts of the experts from the various major factions of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>If they could really extend their time, they might have a chance to find the thief and avoid being killed.</p><p>At once, all the top talents from all the forces were on their way to planet thousand spirits.</p><p>The divine sons of the three Overlord forces, as well as the top talents of the ice Soul Clan and the Scarlet Flame clan, all went to planet thousand spirits.</p><p>Of course, experts from all the major forces also secretly went to planet thousand spirits.</p><p>For a time, myriad spirit star, the largest trading planet in the Qin heaven star system, became extremely lively.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, Wu Zifeng, and the others had also arrived on planet myriad spirit.</p><p>the arena set up by the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is in the central square. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the central square.</p><p>There was a huge empty space in the central square. In the middle of the empty space, there was a huge fighting ring.</p><p>During this period of time, this area was filled with people.</p><p>On one side of the fighting ring, there was a row of seats. A group of young men and women sat on the seats.</p><p>These young men and women all had haughty expressions as they looked at the crowd in all directions with faint disdain in their eyes.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>there are quite a lot of people here. Unfortunately, they’re all trash. Not a single one of them is decent!</p><p>A golden-robed young man’s calm voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>“That’s right, they’re too useless. No matter what, this is still a Starfield, and they’re just a few cats and dogs? This is really disappointing!”</p><p>Another young man said in disdain.</p><p>In the surroundings, when the people of the Qin heaven Starfield heard this, they were all furious.</p><p>Hmph, the true geniuses of my Qin heaven Starfield haven’t arrived yet. Don’t be arrogant!</p><p>Someone couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“Oh? There were real geniuses? You didn’t brag about it, did you? hahaha!”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man laughed with disdain.</p><p>who’s bragging? I believe those heaven’s favorites will be here soon. At that time, they might be able to fight with you!</p><p>That person from the Qin heaven Starfield said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
