His figure flashed and he returned to the crowd of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He sat cross-legged and began to heal.</p><p>However, no one dared to underestimate the sword of fatality.</p><p>In the beginning, the sword of fatality had defeated sword Dao Wu Ji and Mo jiuye in a row and had consumed a large amount of divine power. After that, it had actually fought with the seventh-level celestial deity red flame demon pine and caused both of them to be injured. This level of combat power was truly terrifying.</p><p>If the sword of fatality was at its peak, it might not have lost to the red flame demonic pine.</p><p>With that, there were still five people left in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region still had seven people.</p><p>Although they still had the advantage in numbers, the people from the Qin heaven Starfield were not confident at all.</p><p>The red flame magic pine didn’t say anything. He was seizing the opportunity to heal his injuries and recover some strength.</p><p>you’ve cultivated the ancient God Body at the seventh level celestial deity realm. Your strength is considered not bad among the seventh level celestial deities!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the Golden-robed young man spoke again. As he spoke, he slowly walked out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“Jin Xing is about to make his move!”</p><p>“Jin Xing finally can’t hold it in anymore. That’s good. With his help, this battle will end. I won’t have to do anything!”</p><p>“We’ll just watch the show!”</p><p>The remaining few youths from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion laughed out loud. Their expressions were relaxed and they looked like they would definitely win.</p><p>The red flame demon pine looked at the Golden-robed young man with a serious look.</p><p>From the start, the Golden-robed young man had been speaking on behalf of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It could be seen that this person’s talent must be very shocking.</p><p>you want to seize the time to recover, right? I’ll give you a chance!</p><p>Jin Xing said indifferently. He stood there without moving, letting the red flame demon pine recover. He looked very confident.</p><p>Seeing this, the red flame demonic pine naturally did not hold back. It took out a few divine pills for healing and recovering divine power, swallowed them in one go, and used its divine technique to recover with all its might.</p><p>The wound on his chest was wriggling at a speed visible to the naked eye, and it was recovering quickly.</p><p>After half an hour, the wound on Scarlet Flame demonic pine’s chest had completely disappeared. His condition had also returned to its peak.</p><p>“Come, let’s fight. Although you gave me time to recover, I won’t show any mercy.”</p><p>The red flame demonic pine stared at Jin Xing, its battle intent strong.</p><p>However, Jin Xing shook his head and said, you alone are not my match. You, attack together!</p><p>Jin Xing’s last sentence was directed at the ice immortal.</p><p>“What? This person wanted to challenge both the red flame demon pine and the ice fairy at the same time? Could it be that his cultivation has already reached the eighth level heavenly deity realm?”</p><p>Someone was shocked.</p><p>no, this old man has observed him. This person’s cultivation is at the sixth level of the celestial deity realm!</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, a white-haired Godking spoke.</p><p>“What? He’s only a sixth level celestial deity and he’s already so confident that he wants to challenge the ice immortal and the red flame demon pine at the same time? Where does he get his confidence from?”</p><p>that’s right. The sword of fatality is strong enough, but at his peak, he’s at most on par with the red flame magic pine!</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, many people were shouting in disbelief.</p><p>A sixth level celestial deity actually challenged the Scarlet Flame demonic pine and ice immortal at the same time.</p><p>The ice immortal had always been as famous as the red flame demonic pine. The two had fought many times in the past, but it was difficult to determine a winner. The red flame demonic pine had broken through to the seventh level celestial deity realm, so the ice immortal must be in the same situation.</p><p>Moreover, they were all divine sons and peerless geniuses. Where did Jin Xing’s confidence come from?</p><p>“You really want to challenge the two of us? This is not in line with the rules. At that time, if we win …”</p><p>Ice deity said.</p><p>“If you can win, it’ll be your win!”</p><p>Before ice immortal could speak, Jin Xing said indifferently.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Ice immortal agreed immediately. Since the other party was so confident, there was no reason for him to refuse.</p><p>Taking a step forward, ice fairy also appeared on the fighting ring, standing side by side with red flame demonic pine, and a terrible chill emanated from her body.</p><p>Ice immortal and red flame magic pine, one cold and one hot, one cold and one hot, formed a terrible wave and rushed towards Jin Xing.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jin Xing took a step forward, and his aura bloomed.</p><p>Sixth level celestial deity, his cultivation was indeed only at the sixth level celestial deity.</p><p>The Golden divine power covered his whole body and destroyed the breath of ice immortal and red flame demon pine.</p><p>“Ice immortal, you go left, I’ll go right!”</p><p>Red flame demonic pine sent a message to ice immortal, and then rushed to the right of Jin Xing.</p><p>At the same time, ice immortal rushed to Jin Xing’s left side. As she rushed out, her body quickly grew and turned into an ancient God Body.</p><p>The moment she attacked, everyone knew ice immortal’s cultivation. She was indeed a seventh level celestial deity.</p><p>“Falling star!”</p><p>“Rapid ice sword!”</p><p>Both the red flame magic pine and ice immortal launched their ultimate moves at the same time, and charged towards Jin Xing.</p><p>Since Jin Xing was so confident, he definitely had terrifying strength. They didn’t think that Jin Xing was just acting tough.</p><p>The red flame demon pine and ice fairy were mortal enemies. They had fought with each other countless times and knew each other the best. Their cooperation was flawless.</p><p>The two attacks were about to drown Jin Xing. Jin Xing, who was the size of an ordinary person, was like an ant in front of the two ancient God bodies.</p><p>However, Jin Xing remained calm in the face of the two’s pincer attack.</p><p>“Void severing hand!”</p><p>Jin Xing muttered. His two palms turned golden as if they were cast from gold.</p><p>Then, he struck at ice fairy and red flame demonic pine with his palm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Jin Xing’s Golden Palm collided with the attacks of the ice immortal and the red flame demonic pine, causing two loud bangs.</p><p>Then, the meteorites launched by the red flame demon pine exploded.</p><p>The red flame demon pine’s body shook violently, and it retreated continuously.</p><p>At the same time, ice immortal’s attack also exploded, and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>This scene was extremely shocking and impactful.</p><p>It was as if two elephants had been forced back by an ant.</p><p>“This … How is that possible?”</p><p>Many people opened their mouths in disbelief.</p><p>Ice immortal and Scarlet Flame demonic pine were seventh-level celestial deity divine sons and had used the ancient God Body, but they were still no match for Jin Xing and were forced back.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze landed on Jin Xing’s two Golden Palms.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming felt that Jin Xing’s palm burst out with a terrible destructive power, which destroyed the attacks of the ice immortal and the Scarlet Flame demonic pine in one move.</p><p>“The void severing hand?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. This was a terrifying secret skill.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>After pushing back ice immortal and red flame demonic pine with one move, Jin Xing shouted coldly, took a step forward, and rushed towards the red flame demonic pine. He then struck out a palm towards the red flame demonic pine.</p><p>A Golden Palm formed. It was huge, even bigger than the ancient God Body of the red flame demon pine, and it pressed down on the red flame demon pine.</p><p>The red flame demonic pine roared and kept punching out with its magma-like fists at the Golden Palm print.</p><p>However, the Golden Palm print was shockingly powerful. As it pressed down, the magma-like fist kept exploding.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
