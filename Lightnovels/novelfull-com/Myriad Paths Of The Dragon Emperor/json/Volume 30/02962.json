Their eyes were ferocious and their killing intent was cold.</p><p>Some of the demon slaves here were those who had made mistakes in Magic City mountain and were sent here to become demon slaves.</p><p>However, most of The Fiend slaves were sneakily captured by Magic City mountain from the outside. These fiend slaves naturally hated Magic City mountain to the core.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Many desolate beasts roared angrily, their huge bodies colliding everywhere as they rushed outside.</p><p>There were also many demonic slaves that charged into other secret chambers, releasing even more demonic slaves and desolate beasts.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming did not have to do anything. The secret room in the underground space was constantly being opened. Demonic slaves and desolate beasts kept rushing out and killing.</p><p>However, the myriad fiend Lord and the five hundred demonic city guards were too powerful. They formed a large formation and shot out beams of divine light, killing a large number of demonic slaves and desolate beasts.</p><p>However, there were too many demonic slaves and desolate beasts, and there was no lack of powerful existences among them. Evil and the others began to feel some pressure.</p><p>“Quick, send the signal and ask for help!”</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>Immediately, someone sent out a signal. Beams of light shot up into the sky and could be seen throughout the entire demonic city.</p><p>“Something has happened in the animal arena!”</p><p>“It’s a rescue signal!”</p><p>“Get ready to move!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the entire Shanghai was alarmed. All the Shanghai guards were ready to go.</p><p>“Shanghai guards, assemble!”</p><p>Two figures walked out of the city Lord’s mansion. One was a middle-aged man, and the other was an old man. Both of them exuded a terrifying aura.</p><p>The two of them were half-step divine kings, the other two of the nine great demon kings of the demon capital.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Beams of light flew over from all directions of Shanghai and landed in front of the two. They were all Shanghai guards in iron armors. Soon, there were about two thousand Shanghai guards gathered here.</p><p>“You guys, come with us to support the Colosseum and kill all the enemies!”</p><p>A demon master spoke, his voice loud and clear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of the guards roared.</p><p>Then, the two demon masters led about two thousand demonic city guards and charged into the Colosseum.</p><p>“It seems that someone can’t help but make the first move!”</p><p>Not far away, a figure flashed and a young figure appeared.</p><p>This figure was su mu.</p><p>haha, just as well. We’ve lured away quite a few of the Shanghai guards. Now, we can also start taking action!</p><p>Another figure appeared from another direction. It was Pei Lin.</p><p>“Let’s just wait for the battle to start, in case these demonic city guards come back!”</p><p>On the other side, two figures appeared. They were Wu Xue and the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm. The one who had just spoken was Wu Xue.</p><p>that’s right. Let’s wait. This time, I must get a demon master token!</p><p>Pei Lin muttered, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>In the nearby buildings, figures flickered. Besides Wu Xue, Pei Lin and the others, there were also some other heaven’s favorites. These people seemed to have a common purpose, and they were waiting quietly.</p><p>……</p><p>In the Colosseum, Lu Ming and Wu Zifeng reached the fifth level without a hitch.</p><p>In a secret chamber, he saw Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong.</p><p>The two of them looked Haggard.</p><p>“Magic City mountain shall be destroyed!”</p><p>Seeing Qiu Yue’s Haggard face, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with a shocking murderous intent.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong were overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qiuyue, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’m fine. Don’t worry, young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue shook her head and smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He was relieved to see that Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong were fine.</p><p>“Let’s go, we’ll charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, he rushed out with Qiu Yue and the rest.</p><p>Outside, it was a complete mess.</p><p>The demonic slaves and desolate beasts charged forward, while all evil and the demon capital guards set up a large formation to kill the demonic slaves and desolate beasts.</p><p>The huge Colosseum was filled with blood and Qi, making it look like hell on earth.</p><p>“That brat, it’s that brat. He’s trying to save someone and leave …”</p><p>Wan Xing was hiding behind evildoer and was scanning the area. He noticed Lu Ming and Qiu Yue the moment they came out.</p><p>But then again, Lu Ming was in his ancient God Body state. It would be difficult for him not to attract attention.</p><p>“Don’t let that brat escape, kill him!”</p><p>All evil roared and commanded the demonic city guards. Instantly, beams of terrifying divine light shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hide behind me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and protected Qiu Yue and the others behind him. He waved his long spear and swept it toward the divine light.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of rumbles sounded, and beams of divine light were sent flying by him.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled his divine energy and enveloped Qiu Yue and the other two with it. He took them and was about to rush in another direction.</p><p>He planned to leave this place first and settle this score with Magic City mountain.</p><p>if you want to leave, stop him. Don’t care about those fiend slaves. This kid is the main culprit. We must kill him!</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>Following that, the great array formed by all evil and the demonic city guards changed its direction and blasted most of the divine light toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group’s path was blocked.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s …”</p><p>With that, many of the demonic slaves and wild beasts were free from the blockade. They broke out of the encirclement and flew towards the sky above the Colosseum.</p><p>“You want to leave? All of you, stay here!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice rang out. In the sky, a blood-red blade light suddenly appeared.</p><p>At least dozens of demonic slaves were killed by the saber Light.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>A sharp sneer was heard. Pairs of ghostly claws suddenly appeared in the sky and clawed down, killing dozens of demonic slaves.</p><p>Then, two figures appeared in the sky, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Demon Lord, it’s the demon Lord!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Many of the demon slaves shouted in fear.</p><p>The other two demon masters had arrived at demon Capital Mountain.</p><p>At the same time, a stream of light flew over from behind. The other Shanghai guards were also rushing over.</p><p>rush out, let’s rush out together. Otherwise, when those Shanghai guards arrive, we’ll all die!</p><p>A fiend slave roared.</p><p>“Kill! Kill them all!”</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Many demonic slaves and desolate beasts charged into the sky.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two demon masters shouted at the same time and attacked together. The blood-red blade light and the pitch-black ghostly claw reappeared in the void.</p><p>The cultivation of The Fiend master was too strong. He completely suppressed these desolate beasts and fiend slaves.</p><p>Screams filled the air as large numbers of demonic slaves and desolate beasts ‘corpses fell to the ground.</p><p>After a while, the demonic city guards arrived. The battle was one-sided, and it became a massacre.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming’s path was also blocked.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl. His long spear grew to a few hundred meters long and swept out continuously. The divine lights were blasted away.</p><p>However, the combined power of all evil and the 500 demonic city guards was truly astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack but he was still firmly held back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
