To save your life, you actually killed your own elder!”</p><p>Creak!</p><p>Supreme universe clenched his fists tightly, feeling extremely humiliated.</p><p>He lowered his head, and his eyes were filled with malevolent killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’ll compromise for now. As long as I keep my life, I’ll make you pay ten times, no, a hundred or a thousand times the price one day. I’ll torture your family to death one by one in front of you. I’ll cripple your cultivation and let you live like a dead dog, in pain!”</p><p>The universe master roared madly in his heart. He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p><p>However, the moment he raised his head, the killing intent and hatred in his eyes disappeared. There was only a smile.</p><p>Holy Son Lu Ming is right. However, it’s a pity that a Supreme-being is so stubborn to offend such a proud Son of Heaven like Holy Son Lu Ming. He deserves to die!”</p><p>Supreme universe smiled apologetically.</p><p>shameless! Oh my God, he’s really shameless!</p><p>how shameless! Holy Son Lu Ming said that the Supreme universe is worse than pigs and dogs!</p><p>I used to respect him so much. It’s so disgusting!</p><p>Many of the Kong Xuan sect’s disciples saw this and immediately cursed and ridiculed.</p><p>Now, they were not afraid of the Supreme universe.</p><p>Grandmaster universe master’s heart was filled with killing intent, but he still had a smile on his face.”Holy Son Lu Ming, I can follow you from now on, right?”</p><p>“Follow me? I only promised not to kill you, I didn’t say I wanted you to follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>yes, yes, yes. I’m not fit to follow Holy Son Lu Ming. If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave!</p><p>Universe master nodded repeatedly. He was even happier that Lu Ming did not want him to follow him.</p><p>“Leave? The traitor still wants to leave?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice turned cold.</p><p>Universe master’s body stiffened, and his expression turned ugly.”Holy Son Lu Ming, what’s the meaning of this? you just said that if I kill the Supreme-being, you’ll spare me and let me go.”</p><p>that’s right. I did promise not to kill you, but that’s only on my behalf. I can’t represent all the elders and disciples of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>you’ve betrayed the Kong Xuan sect, so you’ll naturally be punished by the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You … Lu Ming, you’re despicable, shameless, and you don’t keep your word …”</p><p>The Supreme universe roared angrily. He knew that he had fallen into Lu Ming’s trap.</p><p>when did I go back on my word? I said I won’t kill you, so I won’t kill you. However, I’m only the Saint of the Kong Xuan sect. I don’t have the right to represent the elders of the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>“Elders, what do you think is the punishment for betraying the sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the elders of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“Betraying the sect, he should be executed!”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said coldly.</p><p>“Alright, then I’ll leave this Supreme universe to elder Yue to handle.”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, you are despicable and shameless …”</p><p>Supreme universe roared hysterically.</p><p>Now, how could he not know that from the beginning, Lu Ming had no intention of letting him off.</p><p>Even the powerful Dark Dragon listened to Lu Ming’s commands. Now, as long as Lu Ming said something, no one in the entire Kong Xuan sect would dare to disobey him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming said that he could not represent the elders of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“Die, traitor!”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya stepped out. With a wave of his hand, a beam of moonlight slashed towards Supreme universe.</p><p>With Yue Wu Ya’s cultivation, although he had suffered some damage previously, it was far from what the universe master could withstand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I curse you …”</p><p>die! universe master roared, but before he could even finish his words, he was struck by Yue Wu Ya. His body was torn apart, and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>At this point, the Supreme clan was almost completely annihilated.</p><p>After dealing with the Supreme-being clan, the people from the Kong Xuan sect looked at Lu Ming, especially at the dark Dragon under his feet. Their eyes were filled with respect.</p><p>The elder of Kong Xuan sect flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, may I know who this is?”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya’s gaze turned to you long.</p><p>He was, of course, asking you long.</p><p>“This is a friend of mine.”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“My friend!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes narrowed. In their eyes, Lu Ming had become even more unfathomable.</p><p>Such a powerful existence was actually Lu Ming’s friend.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Right at this moment, the sound of a bell rang out from within the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“This is a death knell. What’s going on?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>The death knell would not be sounded under normal circumstances. It would only be sounded when an important figure of the Kong Xuan sect had fallen.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect had indeed lost an important figure this time, and that was Zhi Zun Dong. However, Zhi Zun Dong was a traitor, so he would not sound the death knell because of him.</p><p>the sect master has fallen! The sect master has fallen!</p><p>At this moment, a white-haired old man flew out and called out sadly, ”</p><p>“What? The sect master has fallen!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“Elder Shang, what’s going on?”</p><p>“How did the sect master suddenly die?”</p><p>One by one, the doyens flew towards the old man and asked.</p><p>I don’t know either. I saw that the overall situation was settled, so I returned to the life Palace and saw that the sect master’s life plate was broken!</p><p>Elder Shang Yuan said.</p><p>Many important figures in the Kong Xuan sect had life tokens stored in their life palaces.</p><p>Once a life Jade was broken, it meant that he had fallen.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How could this be? What happened?”</p><p>no wonder the sect master didn’t appear before!</p><p>Immediately, the entire Kong Xuan sect started discussing and making all sorts of guesses.</p><p>However, no one knew the result.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not tell them how the Dragon Boat Mountain had fallen.</p><p>the death of the sect master is temporarily sealed and confidential. No one is to leak it out!</p><p>In the end, the elders issued an order.</p><p>However, they also knew that such a big matter couldn’t be kept a secret for long. It was only a matter of time before it was leaked.</p><p>They were secretly rejoicing that an expert like you long was staying in the Kong Xuan sect. Otherwise, if the news of the fall of Dragon Boat Mountain were to be leaked, the Kong Xuan sect would most likely be in danger.</p><p>Even some of the top forces wouldn’t be afraid of them, let alone the three Overlord forces.</p><p>Then, the elders of the Kong Xuan sect began to discuss what to do next.</p><p>Lu Ming suggested that the various elders assist Ouyang Qingxiang and temporarily take charge of the Kong Xuan sect. When Ouyang Qingxiang became a Divine King in the future, she would officially take over the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang was a zongzi to begin with. Since Lu Ming had spoken, the elders naturally agreed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s words now carried a lot of weight. The moment he opened his mouth, the elders of Kong Xuan sect had to consider it.</p><p>Just like that, many elders helped Ouyang Xiangxiang manage the Kong Xuan sect, and the sect was on the right track.</p><p>The dark Dragon secret realm!</p><p>“Lu Ming, this Dark Dragon is too heavily injured. I can still use this Dark Dragon’s body for the time being. For the time being, I’ll stay in the dark Dragon’s body and recuperate in the dark Dragon secret realm. As for the other matters, you’ll have to rely on yourself,”</p><p>The bone Devil’s voice sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
