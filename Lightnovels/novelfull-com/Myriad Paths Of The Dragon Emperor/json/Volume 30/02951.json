He activated it to the extreme.</p><p>At this moment, the demon city’s city Lord’s strength was unleashed to the peak, even surpassing ordinary ninth level celestial deities.</p><p>He waved his hands and formed two huge palms that blasted upwards in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s move.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming transformed into an ancient God Body, his combat strength was so powerful that he could not withstand it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance slammed heavily on the palm. The palm only managed to block it for a moment before it crumbled with a bang and dissipated into energy.</p><p>The huge spear light hit the general Devil city’s City Master heavily.</p><p>The city Lord of general Devil City let out a blood-curdling screech as the ground continued to crack open, revealing a huge spear-shaped mark.</p><p>The city Lord of Jiang Mo City was embedded in the ground like a pool of mud. His bones were almost broken, and his body almost exploded. Blood was spurting out. He was already dying from serious injuries.</p><p>As for Yan Zhi, he had already been turned into a pile of flesh under the bombardment of the spear radiance. He was as dead as dead could be.</p><p>“Run, quickly run!”</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>The remaining general fiend guards screamed in fear and fled in all directions.</p><p>“All of you, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>He executed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and chased after the demonic general guards while continuously sweeping out with his long spear.</p><p>Once the array was broken, these general fiend guards were completely defenseless in Lu Ming’s hands. They exploded one after another.</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>Many general fiend guards cried out for mercy.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were cold and merciless. He continued to attack and reap lives.</p><p>In less than a moment, Lu Ming had killed all 3600 general fiend guards. Not a single one was left.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he landed beside the general Demon city’s City Master.</p><p>“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me …”</p><p>The city Lord of general Devil City shouted. At this moment, he had no hatred, only fear.</p><p>“Tell me, how can I save my friend?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>I don’t know. They were taken to Shanghai. I don’t know where they’ll be taken to!</p><p>The general Demon city’s city Lord shouted.</p><p>“Then go to hell!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Wait, wait a minute, didn’t you want to enter Magic City? Also, if you want to save your friend, you have to enter the Magic City. I have a token here that can allow you to enter the Magic City smoothly!”</p><p>“As long as you let me go, I’ll give you the token!”</p><p>Jiang Mo city’s city Lord called out.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to negotiate with me. Hand it over!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“No, unless you don’t kill me, I will never give it to you!”</p><p>Jiang Mo city’s city Lord shouted. This was his only chance to save his life, so how could he say it out loud?</p><p>“Let’s see if you’ll tell me!”</p><p>Lu Ming snorted coldly. He stretched out his hand and pointed. A stream of divine power rushed into the glabella of the general Demon city’s City Master and rushed toward his soul.</p><p>“Ah …”</p><p>The general Devil city’s city Lord let out a shrill scream. He felt as if his soul was about to be torn apart.</p><p>“Are you going to hand it over?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Not handing it over? come on. This little bit of torture is nothing compared to the torture of the devil soul curse seal. If you don’t let me go, don’t even think about getting the token!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord roared.</p><p>He had been tortured by the devil soul curse seal all year round, so his endurance was extremely high. This kind of method was ineffective against him.</p><p>hehe, do you think I won’t be able to get it if you don’t hand it over? your token must be hidden in your storage ring, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The city Lord’s face turned pale.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that he had guessed correctly.</p><p>“Don’t …”</p><p>The general Demon city’s city Lord shouted, but it was too late.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A spear light pierced through the city Master of general Devil city’s glabella, killing him completely.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took off the storage ring of the demon city’s City Master and searched through it.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and nine tokens appeared in the air. Nine different tokens.</p><p>“Which kind of token is the one to enter Shanghai?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“We’ll know once we ask someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a self-deprecating smile and grabbed at the air. In the distance, an old man could not help but be grabbed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Milord, spare me, spare me!”</p><p>The old man screamed and begged for mercy. He was almost scared to death.</p><p>At this moment, he was secretly regretful. If he had known, he wouldn’t have watched the fun.</p><p>“Which token is needed to enter the Magic City?”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the nine tokens and asked.</p><p>So that’s what he was asking. The old man let out a long sigh of relief and quickly pointed to a golden token. this one. With this token, you can freely enter and exit the Magic City. You can even bring five people with you!</p><p>“Alright, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his arm and threw the elder far away.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming put away the nine tokens and soared into the sky, leaving general Demon City.</p><p>After Lu Ming left, the demon City was in chaos. The city Lord’s residence was razed to the ground. The demon city’s city Lord and thousands of general demon guards were killed. This was a huge matter. One could imagine what kind of waves it would cause.</p><p>Ape Demon City. The city Lord of ape Demon City was shocked when he heard the news.</p><p>“Who destroyed the devil general city?”</p><p>The city Lord of ape Demon City asked with a look of fear on his face.</p><p>If the other party could destroy general Devil City, he could also destroy him, which made him tremble with fear.</p><p>However, the answer he received was that he didn’t know.</p><p>No one knew who had destroyed general Demon City. All the general demon guards who had seen Lu Ming were killed.</p><p>The other onlookers only saw Lu Ming’s appearance as an ancient God, but they did not see his actual body.</p><p>Thus, many legends were left behind. Some said that the city Master of the demon City had offended the ancient gods and angered them, so his clan was exterminated by them.</p><p>All sorts of legends became more and more exaggerated as they spread.</p><p>The city Lord of ape Demon City spent a few days in fear and anxiety. After finding out that everything was fine, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>After Lu Ming left the demonic city, he transformed into his normal form and found a hidden place to rest for a few days. Then, he headed in the direction of the demonic city.</p><p>Magic City was located in the center of Magic City mountain. It was surrounded by thirty-six satellite cities, which was magnificent.</p><p>There were a total of four city gates in the demonic city. There was one in the North, South, East, and West, and each gate was heavily guarded. Unless one was a citizen of the demonic city or had a recommendation token, no one could enter.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the West City gate and stepped in.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A group of strong men in iron armor stood in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>“A token!”</p><p>One of the brawny men who looked like a team leader was even more direct. He glared at Lu Ming with a cold gaze. He was prepared to launch an attack if something went wrong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a golden token appeared.</p><p>The other party glanced at the Golden token, and his expression eased a little. He nodded and said, ” “Go in!”</p><p>After saying that, move!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and walked into the Magic City.</p><p>Huge stone houses were built in demonic city. They were hundreds of meters tall and looked magnificent.</p><p>There weren’t many people in demonic city. Almost all of them were subordinates of the night Demon King and his family.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
