Very soon, it arrived in front of Lu Ming and the rest and stopped in the starry sky.</p><p>Everyone saw more than ten figures on the chariot.</p><p>Among them, there were four burly middle-aged men. They were burly and emitted a terrifying aura.</p><p>A Godking. He was definitely a Godking. Moreover, he was definitely an expert among the godkings.</p><p>The other six people were all young people, both male and female. Each of them had a proud expression on their faces, as if they thought highly of themselves.</p><p>Kong Xuan sect’s zongzi, Ouyang Qingxiang, is leading the entire Kong Xuan sect to welcome the emissaries of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang stepped forward and clasped her hands.</p><p>welcome, envoy of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>sect leader! the other people from Kong Xuan sect also cupped their fists and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming was an exception.</p><p>He just casually cupped his fists and sized up the people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion with a curious gaze.</p><p>“Zongzi? Where’s your sect leader? Why aren’t you here to welcome me?”</p><p>A young man with three red scales on his forehead flew down from the chariot and spoke in a cold and arrogant voice.</p><p>However, when his gaze fell on Ouyang Qingxiang, a look of surprise flashed across his face.</p><p>I don’t dare to hide it from you, envoy. My sect’s sect master died hundreds of years ago, and I’m temporarily taking over the sect!</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang replied.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Oh, ” the young man with the scale between his brows replied, but he did not comment.</p><p>“May I ask, emissaries, why have you suddenly come to my Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang nervously asked.</p><p>I was about to tell you about this. Let me tell you, the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the nine absolute God crystal, has been stolen.</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said.</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others looked at each other.</p><p>What did the theft of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s treasure have to do with them?</p><p>after investigation, the person who stole the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the nine absolute God crystal, is from your Qin heaven Starfield!</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows suddenly said in a cold voice.</p><p>What?</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Wuya, and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>The person who stole the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was actually from the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>Could it be that the powerhouses of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion suspected that their Kong Xuan sect had done it?</p><p>The doyens and inner court elders of Kong Xuan sect broke out in a cold sweat when they thought of this.</p><p>great emissaries, are you suspecting that it was done by my Kong Xuan sect? this is impossible. With the number of powerhouses in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, how could anyone from my Kong Xuan sect enter and steal the treasure? ”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya hurriedly said.</p><p>You mean to say that the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s defense can’t make it? ”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said with a dark expression.</p><p>“No, that’s not what I meant. Great Messenger. you’ve misunderstood, you’ve misunderstood …”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya repeatedly bowed, his face covered in cold sweat.</p><p>He was a Second Sky of King God Realm expert, but he had to bow and bend his knees in front of a junior. The other party’s background was too great.</p><p>“Hmph, it’s good that you didn’t!”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows snorted coldly and said, ” this time, any of the forces in your Qin heaven Starfield are suspects. You have to investigate them all. No one is an exception!</p><p>“How does the great Messenger want to investigate?”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang asked.</p><p>it’s very simple. Gather everyone in your Kong Xuan sect and take out your storage rings for us to inspect. Also, release your mind sea and dantian. We also want to inspect your mind sea and dantian to prevent you from placing your treasures in your mind sea and dantian!</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said.</p><p>“What? I want to check the storage ring!”</p><p>“There’s also the sea of consciousness and dantian!”</p><p>Many people cried out in alarm, their expressions unsightly.</p><p>If that was the case, they would have no more secrets to keep.</p><p>The storage ring, sea of consciousness, and dantian were the greatest secrets of a cultivator. It was impossible to let others see them.</p><p>Which person didn’t have any secrets?</p><p>Yet, the other party wanted to check everyone’s storage rings, consciousness, and dantian. How overbearing.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Do you have any objections?”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows asked coldly.</p><p>The rest of the people stepped down from the chariot and cast hostile looks at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“It would be a wonder if he didn’t have any opinions!”</p><p>Everyone roared in their hearts.</p><p>emissaries, we really didn’t steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Even if you give us a hundred guts, we wouldn’t dare to!</p><p>that’s right. Moreover, our cultivation is low, so we can’t steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion at all. I hope that all envoys can understand!</p><p>The elders of Kong Xuan sect spoke one after another.</p><p>nonsense, I don’t care about you. My mission here is to find the nine absolute God crystal. Don’t talk nonsense with me, just follow my orders!</p><p>The young man with the scale between his brows shouted coldly, as if he was scolding a group of slaves. He was direct and overbearing, not showing any mercy.</p><p>Yue Wu Ya and a few other God King experts had ugly expressions.</p><p>The other party was just a young man. Furthermore, they could see that his cultivation was only at the sixth level heavenly deity realm. If he dared to speak to them like this in any other place, he would have been slapped to death by them long ago.</p><p>However, the other party was an envoy from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, and there were terrifying experts following him. They did not dare to do so at all.</p><p>However, they were not willing to take out their storage rings or open their spiritual sea dantian for the other party to check.</p><p>For a time, the atmosphere was a little heavy.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’re still not willing? do you want to annihilate the Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows shouted angrily.</p><p>“What big words!”</p><p>A voice was heard. Lu Ming could not bear it anymore and stepped out.</p><p>From the very beginning, the other party had been acting high and mighty, looking down on them. It was as if Lu Ming and the rest had to do as he said. Lu Ming was really unhappy.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming walked out, the young man with the scale between his eyebrows stared at Lu Ming with a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said coldly.</p><p>“Didn’t you hear what I said? Your ears aren’t good?”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a cold face. Once his temper flared up, he would not care who the other party was.</p><p>“The moment you come here, you want us to give you our storage rings and our sea of consciousness dantian for you to investigate? Just based on your words? Then, let me check your dantian and sea of consciousness first!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“Kid, you still want to check my dantian sea of consciousness? Who Do You Think You Are? You’re just a lowly ant and a piece of trash. How can you compare yourself to me? you’ll do whatever I tell you to do, understand? Trash!”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows shouted loudly, as if he had Lu Ming in the palm of his hand.</p><p>hehe, you’re making yourself sound noble. In my opinion, everyone’s the same. There’s no difference between noble and lowly. If you want to investigate us, why can’t we investigate you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Kid, you’re bringing trouble to your Kong Xuan sect, do you understand?”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his brows had a cold expression as he threatened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
