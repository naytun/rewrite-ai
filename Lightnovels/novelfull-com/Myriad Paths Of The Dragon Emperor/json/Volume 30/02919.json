Once it recovered, it would be extremely terrifying.</p><p>Of course, the dark dragon’s soul had already been destroyed, and bone demon had only temporarily borrowed its body. It was impossible for him to recover to his peak.</p><p>However, even if he did not recover to his peak, as long as he recovered to the peak of the divine King realm, Lu Ming would be able to do whatever he wanted.</p><p>“Then I’ll be leaving!”</p><p>Bone demon said and controlled the dark Dragon. With a twist of his body, he flew into the depths of the dark Dragon secret realm and disappeared.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he left the dark Dragon secret realm and soon arrived at a mountain peak.</p><p>This mountain was an independent mountain belonging to the Kong Xuan sect. It was rich in divine Qi and had an excellent cultivation environment. It was one of the top mountains in the entire Kong Xuan sect. However, it now belonged to Lu Ming alone.</p><p>After setting up a simple array around the mountain peak, Lu Ming went to a large hall in the middle of the mountain peak and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Then, a storage ring appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>Looking at the storage ring, Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with strong anticipation.</p><p>This was because this storage ring belonged to Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>What kind of treasures could a sect leader’s storage ring have?</p><p>Lu Ming did not know about other things, but he knew that the core of the star must be in this storage ring.</p><p>“There’s a restriction indeed!”</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the ring with his spiritual senses and found that there was indeed a restriction on the storage ring.</p><p>However, this was the storage ring of the Dragon Boat Mountain. He couldn’t ask the Godking of the Kong Xuan sect for help, so he could only break this restriction himself.</p><p>With a thought, the six divine fires in his dantian burned fiercely. With the ruler’s divine power as the leader, the six types of divine power mixed together and surged toward the restriction on the storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to slowly erase the restrictions on it.</p><p>Even with the mysterious power of the creator, Lu Ming still used a full three months to erase the restriction on the storage ring.</p><p>As soon as the restriction was destroyed, Lu Ming’s spiritual consciousness entered the ring and scanned it impatiently.</p><p>The first thing he saw was a Jade box in the spatial ring.</p><p>Even though they were separated by the jade box, he could still feel the surging energy emanating from it.</p><p>The star core!</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that the jade box definitely contained a star core.</p><p>His palm glowed and the jade box appeared in Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he almost could not hold the jade box. The weight of the jade box was shocking.</p><p>“Brat, with your current cultivation, you can’t absorb the core of this star!”</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the voice of the quantity formula sounded.</p><p>“Then what cultivation level does one need to be to absorb it?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“The core of this star was refined by someone with a great divine ability. It contains a lot of energy. You need to be at least at the divine King realm to absorb it. Otherwise, both your soul and body will be burned to ashes!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>only God kings can absorb it. How long would that take? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a dejected look.</p><p>Originally, he had obtained the core of the star and thought that he could use it to advance his cultivation by leaps and bounds. It seemed that he had thought too much.</p><p>“Hehe, kid, don’t be depressed. Did you forget that you still have me?”</p><p>The proud voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>“You? You can absorb and refine this star core?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s tone was full of doubt.</p><p>Back then, the ” measure ” word art had taken a long time to refine the dark Dragon blood jade and the ancient God flower’s energy.</p><p>The energy in the core of a star was many times stronger than that of the dark Dragon blood jade and the ancient God flower. Could the quantity formula refine it?</p><p>Lu Ming had serious doubts.</p><p>“Kid, what’s with your tone? Are you doubting my ability? I’m so angry!”</p><p>The quantity formula roared.</p><p>“I’m not doubting your ability, it’s just … However, if it took you so long to refine the dark Dragon blood jade and the ancient God flower’s energy, wouldn’t it take tens or hundreds of thousands of years to refine the star’s core?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Nonsense, kid, what do you know? I’m living in your body now, so I’m living in symbiosis with you. My ability is also determined by your cultivation base. If your cultivation base is weak, my ability will be weak. The higher your cultivation base, the higher my ability will be!”</p><p>“In the past, my refining ability was weak because you were trash. Do you understand?”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula screamed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>However, he finally understood that the energy of the quantity formula was closely related to his strength.</p><p>This was reasonable. Otherwise, the quantity formula was one of the original ancient characters. The speed at which it refined energy was too slow.</p><p>“Boy, now that your cultivation has reached the heavenly God Realm, my refining energy has also been greatly improved. I can barely refine this star core, but I can only do it slowly, bit by bit. It will take a long time to completely refine it!”</p><p>however, even if it’s just a little bit, once I transfer the refined energy to you, it will greatly increase your cultivation speed.</p><p>“Kid, the cultivation technique you’re cultivating is special. You need to cultivate many kinds of divine power and divine flames. Especially when you reach the divine King realm, you will be able to condense more star cores than others. At that time, every time you break through a new realm, you will need many times more energy than the others. Your cultivation speed will also be many times slower!”</p><p>“But with this star core, your cultivation speed will not be slow!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula went on and on.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was true that he cultivated the Qian Kun thousand Dao scroll and many Shen powers. The amount of energy he needed to break through was much more than others.</p><p>In this way, his cultivation speed would be very slow.</p><p>Therefore, during this period of time, he did not dare to cultivate any other divine techniques, for fear that it would affect his cultivation speed.</p><p>However, with this star core, he would not be afraid no matter how many divine techniques he cultivated or how much divine power he cultivated.</p><p>“Old Liang, can you directly swallow this star core?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>He recited the ‘measure’ formula. Then, Lu Ming’s glabella lit up and a ‘measure’ word flew out from his glabella.</p><p>“Lu Ming, open the jade box!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately circulated his divine energy and condensed two large hands with it. He grabbed the jade box and opened the lid.</p><p>As soon as he opened the lid of the jade box, Lu Ming saw a crystal the size of a human head in the box. It was dazzling like a small sun, emitting a terrifying and boundless energy fluctuation.</p><p>In an instant, there was a terrifying energy that was about to rush into the sky.</p><p>Fortunately, the ” quantity ” formula rapidly enlarged and directly enveloped the star core. The next moment, the energy fluctuations disappeared, and so did the star core to avoid alarming others.</p><p>After the ” quantity ” formula devoured the star core, it flew into Lu Ming’s glabella and settled down in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the ” quantity ” formula would take time to refine the star core. He just had to wait patiently for the harvest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
