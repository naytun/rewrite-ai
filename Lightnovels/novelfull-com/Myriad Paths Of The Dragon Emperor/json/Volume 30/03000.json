In a flash, she also rushed into the land of the cold nether and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, after the beautiful woman entered the land of cold nether, her body paused slightly, and her speed slowed down slightly.</p><p>“The Qi of the cold nether will affect him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The Hades Qi was extremely cold and the temperature was extremely low. Lu Ming was able to withstand the Hades Qi without being affected because he had cultivated the lunar divine technique and had the lunar divine energy in his body.</p><p>However, the divine power that the beautiful woman cultivated clearly had nothing to do with cold power, so she needed to circulate divine power to block the cold energy. Her speed was naturally affected.</p><p>Even so, the absolute Beauty’s speed was still faster than Lu Ming’s. The distance between them was constantly closing.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The beautiful woman’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. She looked as if she could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>“What benefits did the Jin and Qin families give you to kill me? I can give you double the benefits!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>“What Bullsh * t Jin and Qin families? what right do they have to ask me to kill you?”</p><p>The absolute beauty said coldly.</p><p>“Not the Jin and Qin families? Which force was it? Is it the force that has been colluding with the dark ice Clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart suddenly moved and he immediately shouted,”I know who you are. The person behind you has colluded with the dark ice Clan to steal the nine absolute divine crystal. How dare you! This is a crime that will result in your entire family being exterminated!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly, trying to scare the other party.</p><p>“Nonsense! If I want to kill you, it has nothing to do with anyone else!”</p><p>The absolute beauty sneered coldly and slashed out a beam of sword Qi, almost hitting Lu Ming. Lu Ming was so scared that he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“It has nothing to do with anyone else, and you want to kill me?”</p><p>This time, Lu Ming was really dumbfounded.</p><p>When did he offend this crazy woman?</p><p>“Young lady, if I remember correctly, I have never offended you. Could it be that I was drunk and did you …”</p><p>“No, if you really have me, why don’t I feel anything?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and was even more puzzled.</p><p>“Pervert, die!” Hearing Lu Ming’s words, the absolute beauty was even more furious. She shouted and a few sword lights slashed at Lu Ming’s face.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to Dodge, but his shoulder was still grazed by a sword gleam. The green scales were cut open and blood flowed out.</p><p>Lu Ming was so frightened that he shivered.</p><p>His opponent was a half-step Divine King and had awakened the origin divine power factor. His attack was terrifyingly sharp and his green scale armor could not block it at all.</p><p>“How did I become a perverted Bandit again!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and furious. If not for the fact that he was not the other party’s match, he would definitely take the other party down and let him know what a ‘perverted Bandit’ was.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming could only run for his life.</p><p>He specifically ran towards places with dense frosty Qi and used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to the extreme. Even so, it was still very dangerous, and not long after, several wounds appeared on his body.</p><p>“This crazy woman, why is she chasing me …”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless. His eyes were flashing with ruthlessness. He was thinking quickly in his heart, trying to come up with a plan to kill the other party.</p><p>Lu Ming would not show mercy just because the other party was a beautiful woman.</p><p>Rustle … Rustle …</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heard a rustling sound in front of him.</p><p>“There’s. living being here …”</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>The appearance of living creatures at this moment was beneficial to Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed towards the source of the sound.</p><p>Not long after, a huge creature appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>It was a huge, snow-white centipede that was at least a hundred meters long. It crawled on the mountain.</p><p>At that moment, the giant centipede pounced at Lu Ming the moment it saw him.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Before the giant centipede even reached him, it opened its mouth and spat out a thick gray mist. At the same time, a terrifying chill gushed toward Lu Ming. Even Lu Ming’s body stiffened.</p><p>It was also the frosty Qi, but the temperature was even lower. It was as if the space had frozen.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the divine power of the moon with all his might. At the same time, he used the nine ice chains to protect himself and blocked the invasion of the cold air.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming dodged the giant centipede’s attack in a flash.</p><p>However, the giant centipede twisted its body and its row of sharp claws slashed at Lu Ming like a divine knife. Lu Ming was shocked and raised his spear to block it.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was sent flying.</p><p>However, at this time, the beautiful woman had also caught up. She was also enveloped by the giant centipede’s cold air. Her body stiffened, and her speed suddenly decreased.</p><p>However, she had awakened the origin divine power factor. She circulated her divine power and still blocked the attack of the cold air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant centipede had forced Lu Ming to retreat with one attack. When it saw the beautiful woman, it immediately let out a screech. Its body bounced and it charged at the beautiful woman again.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The absolute beauty was very domineering. Sword light burst out and cut the giant centipede’s body.</p><p>The giant centipede was powerful, it was a half-step Divine King. With the armor it was wearing, it had a strong defense. However, it still couldn’t withstand the attack from the beautiful woman. The sword light cut through the centipede’s armor and left a deep wound.</p><p>“This crazy woman’s strength is amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>If such an attack landed on him, he would probably be cut in half.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>The giant centipede was injured and seemed to have fallen into a state of Fury. It screamed crazily and made a sharp sound. It kept spewing out terrifying cold air towards the beautiful woman.</p><p>The giant centipede only had eyes for the beautiful woman. It could not be bothered with Lu Ming.</p><p>Wherever the cold air passed, even the cold nether energy floating in the air was frozen. It was clear how terrifying the cold air was.</p><p>The absolute beauty had to concentrate on defending. At the same time, she slashed out sword lights towards the giant centipede. The two of them started fighting.</p><p>How could Lu Ming miss such an opportunity? he executed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to the extreme, transformed into a kun Peng, and left the place in a flash.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had gone far away.</p><p>I’ve finally gotten rid of this crazy woman. Who is this crazy woman? did the Qin and Jin families send people to kill me or did they collude with the dark ice Clan to kill me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming guessed in his heart.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming was hundreds of thousands of miles deep into the land of the cold nether.</p><p>The Hellfrost Qi here was getting thicker and thicker. Occasionally, Lu Ming would discover some living creatures.</p><p>However, these living beings were all extremely terrifying. The weakest of them was a ninth level heavenly God while the majority of them were half-step divine kings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
