The divine power on his body continued to explode, and wounds appeared on his body, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>After that, the power of the rising Dragon array seeped into his body and went straight for the soul of Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar came from the Dragon boat’s mouth. The space between his brows shone brightly, and the shadow of a pitch-black Dragon flew out, trying to escape.</p><p>This was a part of the dark dragon’s soul. It had occupied the physical body of Dragon Boat Mountain and was controlling it from there.</p><p>At this moment, you Long’s soul was forced out by the rising Dragon array.</p><p>The moment you Long’s soul came out, he wanted to escape. However, he was bound by the power of the rising Dragon array and could not escape at all.</p><p>As soon as you Long’s soul came out, Dragon boat’s physical body was no longer able to resist. It directly exploded with loud bangs and turned into ashes under the suppression of the rising Dragon array.</p><p>The Grandmaster of his generation, the sect leader of the Kong Xuan sect, had truly disappeared from this world.</p><p>All that was left was a storage ring floating in the air.</p><p>Naturally, the rising Dragon array would not attack the storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. A stream of divine power rolled out and the storage ring was in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but reveal a happy expression on his face.</p><p>The Dragon boats mountain must have hidden the star core in the storage ring. Now, it was in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>That was a peerless treasure that even the king of gods would fight to the death for. How could Lu Ming not be tempted?</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want you to die a horrible death!”</p><p>The Soul of the Dragon boat’s Mountain was howling madly. At this moment, it was being attacked by the rising Dragon formation, and its soul had already become much weaker. If this continued, it would collapse in no time.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>roar! a deafening roar came from the depths of the rising Dragon array. It was the roar of a Dark Dragon.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The entire land shook violently.</p><p>“Not good, you long is going to forcefully attack the formation!”</p><p>Bone was nervous.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The quaking in the depths of the formation became more and more intense.</p><p>Through the gap, they could see that the huge Dark Dragon was struggling with all its might. Its huge body twisted and turned as it crawled toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The dark Dragon blood Curse from before had opened a gap in the trapping Dragon Rising to the heaven array. That Dark Dragon was going to crawl out through this gap.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>From a distance, a terrifying aura could be felt. Lu Ming almost could not breathe.</p><p>“This is bad. Lu Ming, quickly destroy this part of the soul.”</p><p>Bone quickly shouted.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the rising Dragon array with all his might, obliterating that part of the dark dragon’s soul.</p><p>Under the full force of the rising Dragon array, this part of the soul finally exploded with a bang and disappeared.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you are courting death …”</p><p>Inside the rising Dragon array, Dark Dragon let out an angry roar. His body emitted a hot light, and a terrifying aura gushed out like an avalanche, hitting the rising Dragon array.</p><p>His huge body followed the previous gap and continued to climb over.</p><p>The two huge dragon eyes glared at Lu Ming ferociously, as if they could not wait to cut him into eight pieces.</p><p>The portion of soul that occupied Dragon Boat Mountain wasn’t just a small portion. It was at least a small portion of the dark Dragon’s complete soul. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to control Dragon Boat Mountain for so many years and display such powerful battle prowess.</p><p>The loss of this part of his soul was a heavy blow to Dark Dragon.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming had to die.</p><p>this is bad. Lu Ming, retreat quickly. Get out of the rising Dragon formation and use the formation to suppress him!</p><p>Bone demon shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate at all. He retreated rapidly and rushed out of the rising Dragon array.</p><p>“Die! I want you to die!”</p><p>die! you long roared as a berserk power continued to burst forth. He charged madly through the gap from before.</p><p>It had to be said that this Dark Dragon’s strength was truly unfathomable.</p><p>He had been suppressed here for God knows how many years, and now, a part of his soul had been destroyed. However, the power he displayed was still terrifying.</p><p>The entire Rising Dragon array was shaking violently.</p><p>suppress! Suppress!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the rising Dragon formation with all his might. Countless light beam chains wrapped around you long. However, as you long struggled, many of the light beam chains broke and exploded.</p><p>The dark Dragon slowly crawled towards the outside of the Coiling Dragon Rising to the heaven array.</p><p>The main thing was that the dark Dragon blood Curse had opened a gap in the rising Dragon array. Without this gap, no matter how strong the dark Dragon was, it would have been difficult for it to break out.</p><p>But now, he was in danger.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>This Dark Dragon had a total of seven dragon claws on its abdomen. It was a seven-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>His seven dragon claws stomped on the ground, step by step, as he walked toward the outside.</p><p>Although he was constantly attacked by the rising Dragon array, leaving wounds on his body, he did not care and attacked with all his might.</p><p>He knew that this was his last chance. If he didn’t take this chance to escape, he would be trapped here forever until his life was exhausted.</p><p>Therefore, even if he had to pay a huge price, he had to escape.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had a star core on him. As long as he could escape, kill Lu Ming, and obtain the star core, he would be able to recover a part of his strength in a short period of time.</p><p>Therefore, he charged forward without any regard for his life. Not long after, he actually managed to cover half the distance.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The dark Dragon roared, and a terrifying pressure rushed toward Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body trembled, and he was forced to retreat. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>You long was too powerful. He was much stronger than Lu Ming.</p><p>Even if the other party’s strength was greatly reduced, a part of his soul was destroyed, and he was also severely injured by the rising Dragon array, he was still astonishingly strong.</p><p>“Not good. If this continues, he might really escape. Once he does, he’ll definitely be the first one to kill you. You can’t escape from such an existence.”</p><p>Bone shouted.</p><p>“Then what do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I’m going all out. I can only go all out. This time, I can only go all out!</p><p>Bone demon’s eyes were filled with ruthlessness.</p><p>“How do we fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>take the initiative to attack and charge into the enemy’s mouth. Then, you will use all your strength to control the rising Dragon array to deal with him. I will use a secret technique to completely destroy his soul!</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>Lu Ming was a decisive person. Although doing so would be akin to sending a sheep into a Tiger’s mouth and it was very dangerous, he still decided to do so.</p><p>To be reborn after death!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, you long opened his mouth and roared. His killing intent was as cold as a knife.</p><p>“Now is the time …”</p><p>Bone demon shouted.</p><p>Before the bone demon could finish its sentence, Lu Ming’s body had already rushed out and into the dark dragon’s mouth.</p><p>you’re really seeking death. Watch me completely refine you!</p><p>You long roared, and his divine power boiled as it wrapped around Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
