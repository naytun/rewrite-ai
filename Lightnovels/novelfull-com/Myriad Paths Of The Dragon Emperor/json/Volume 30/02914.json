His entire person turned into a full moon, and the moon shone brightly in the sky, illuminating the entire world.</p><p>The power of this move could not be said to not be strong. However, it was still inferior to the attack of the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The demonic sword broke through the air and slashed at the full moon. The full moon trembled violently and was split in half by the demonic sword.</p><p>The moonlight dispersed, and Yue Wu Ya’s figure appeared in mid-air. He was coughing out large mouthfuls of blood, and his body was almost split in half. There was a deep wound on his body, and it was extremely hideous. There was also a pitch-black demonic Qi on it.</p><p>Yue Wuya’s body was sent flying backward, and he fell towards the main gate of Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>A few voices rang out as a few figures flashed and caught Yue Wu Ya. They were Yuexin, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others. Their faces were filled with anxiety.</p><p>“Old man Yue, you’re so stubborn, you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Seeing that Yue Wu Ya had been heavily injured in one move, the Supreme-being was incomparably carefree as he sneered.</p><p>The other members of the Kong Xuan sect turned pale. Some of them hesitated again, considering whether to surrender.</p><p>The strength of the demonic Academy’s Dean was too strong. Apart from Dragon Boat Mountain, no one in the Kong Xuan sect could defeat him. Even someone as strong as Yue Wu Ya was severely injured by a single move.</p><p>I’ll give you one more chance. Swear on your life essence and surrender to me. I’ll spare your life!</p><p>The Dean of the Yimo Academy stared at Yue Wu Ya and spoke again.</p><p>kill me if you want. If you want me to surrender, be your dog. Dream on!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya roared.</p><p>When the Supreme martial artist moved, the faces of the Supreme martial artist, Qian Kun, and the others darkened. It was obvious that Yue Wu Ya was calling them dogs.</p><p>“Alright, since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The cold voice of the demonic Academy’s College chief rang out. A demonic sword soared into the sky, emitting a terrifying pressure.</p><p>The fatal attack was about to land.</p><p>With Yue Wu Ya’s current state, he definitely wouldn’t be able to block this attack.</p><p>“Demon Punisher, if you want to die, why don’t you try?”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from afar. It was filled with cold killing intent and unquestionable authority.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Xing mo was the name of the unique demon Academy’s Dean. However, other than a few people in the Qin Tian star region, no one dared to call him by his name. Instead, they would respectfully address him as the Dean or Lord Dean.</p><p>But now, someone actually dared to call out the name of the Dean of the unique devil Academy and even threaten him.</p><p>Who was it? Such courage!</p><p>“This … What is this?”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, an hai, and the others were all surprised.</p><p>They recognized the voice. It was clearly Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s that Lu Ming!”</p><p>The universe master roared. He hated Lu Ming to the core, so he naturally remembered Lu Ming’s voice clearly.</p><p>“Who’s there? get out here!”</p><p>The Dean of the unique demon Academy stopped his attack and looked coldly in the direction of Lu Ming’s voice.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from that direction, shaking the void. Then, a huge Divine Dragon wriggled over and appeared in everyone’s vision.</p><p>This Divine Dragon was you long, and Lu Ming was standing on its head.</p><p>“A Divine Dragon, what a terrifying aura …”</p><p>look, there’s someone on the Dragon God’s head. It’s Lu Ming, it’s Lu Ming …</p><p>Many Kong Xuan sect disciples cried out as they recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>More people were shocked. Lu Ming had appeared riding on a Divine Dragon. The divine Dragon had a terrifying aura.</p><p>“Kid, were you the one who spoke just now?”</p><p>The deans of the unique devil Academy stared at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they would be trembling in fear when they were stared at by a figure like the Dean of the unique demon Academy. However, Lu Ming completely ignored it. There was even a faint killing intent on his face as he looked directly at the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“That’s right, it seems like you’re not too stupid!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Many people’s hearts were beating wildly, and they were almost scared to death.</p><p>Did Lu Ming eat a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall? he actually dared to say that the Dean of the unique devil Academy was stupid. Did he not want to live anymore?</p><p>this kid is really looking for death. Hahaha, that’s good. It saves me the trouble of doing it!</p><p>Supreme universe laughed in his heart.</p><p>“This brat is dead for sure!”</p><p>Most of the people had the same thought. Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the rest broke out in cold sweat for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, very good. I don’t know how many years it has been since someone dared to say this to me. Very good, I will make you wish you were dead.”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s Dean laughed in extreme anger, and his body emitted a cold killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, the demonic Academy’s College chief made his move. A huge demonic claw appeared and grabbed at Lu Ming, shrouding both Lu Ming and you long.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang and the others ‘expressions changed drastically. However, they could only watch helplessly and were unable to help.</p><p>However, in the face of this move, Lu Ming’s expression remained indifferent and even had a hint of disdain.</p><p>When the demon Claw was about to approach, you long moved.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>arghh! the dark Dragon roared as a pitch-black Dragon Claw shot out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the dark Dragon’s Dragon Claw touched the demonic claw formed by the demonic Academy’s Dean, a soft ‘poof’ sound was heard before the demonic claw was destroyed by the dark Dragon’s Dragon Claw.</p><p>Then, the dark Dragon let out a long roar, and the seven dragon claws on its abdomen stepped out in succession. It grabbed toward the Dean of the unique demon Academy and launched a counterattack.</p><p>“So powerful …”</p><p>Many people’s hearts were beating wildly.</p><p>You Long’s strength had exceeded everyone’s expectations. He had actually easily defeated the attack of the unique devil Academy’s Dean and launched a counterattack.</p><p>The face of the demonic Academy’s Dean also changed. With a shout, the demonic sword in his hand roared out, and terrifying sword lights slashed towards you long.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The demonic sword’s sword radiance struck the Dragon Claw, producing an ear-piercing collision sound. It was as if gold and iron had collided, causing sparks to fly in all directions. A terrifying force swept in all directions.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically. The battle between you long and the Dean of the unique devil Academy was too astonishing. The force that had spread in all directions was so terrifying that it caused one’s heart to tremble. If anyone below the Godking realm were to be sucked into the battle, they would most likely die.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was naturally fine. He stood on you Long’s head and was protected by the energy of you long.</p><p>Continuous explosions were heard. In an instant, the two sides had exchanged hundreds of moves.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>You long suddenly roared and twisted his body. A strong divine power gushed out of his body and spread out along his dragon claws.</p><p>The sword light of the demonic Academy’s College chief trembled violently. It was actually unable to withstand the attack and started to break apart.</p><p>In the end, a Dragon Claw passed through the sword light and grabbed at the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The expression of the demonic Academy’s College chief changed drastically. With a wild roar, he slashed out a vast sword light. In the next moment, the sword light shattered, and the body of the demonic Academy’s College chief trembled violently. He retreated thousands of miles, and a trace of blood seeped out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>The demonic Academy’s Dean was actually defeated and injured. This was simply inconceivable.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
