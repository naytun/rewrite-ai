Justice is in the hearts of the people!”</p><p>let me tell you, my Kong Xuan sect did not steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It is impossible for you to search our dantian sea of consciousness. All cultivators know that the dantian sea of consciousness is the most important secret. If you want to search our dantian sea of consciousness, you might as well kill us directly!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>There were many secrets in his dantian and sea of consciousness.</p><p>The heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture cultivated many types of Shen power.</p><p>There was also the battle formula and the quantity formula. If any of them were exposed, he would die without a burial ground. How could he let the other party search?</p><p>“If you are really suspicious, we can swear on our life source to confirm that we did not steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming still made a concession.</p><p>After all, he had to consider the entire Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>“Swear on the source of life? Hehe, I don’t trust you. The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s treasure is so precious, you can sacrifice a few lives, it’s completely worth it!”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said coldly.</p><p>If one were to make an oath with their life source, the oath wouldn’t be broken immediately. Instead, they might die from Qi deviation in their later cultivation.</p><p>The other party’s meaning was very obvious. Even if someone from Kong Xuan sect really stole the treasure of nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, they could also swear on their life source. At that time, at most, those who stole the treasure would break their oath and die.</p><p>But to the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, it was worth it.</p><p>The expressions of Yue Wu Ya and the others were a little unsightly. It was obvious that the other party would only be at ease if they searched their dantian and sea of consciousness.</p><p>if that’s the case, then there’s nothing more to say. Please go back. It’s impossible for you to search our dantian and sea of consciousness!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold.</p><p>He had already made a concession, but the other party was still pressing him, so he was too lazy to talk nonsense.</p><p>hehehe, good, very good. Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish. After all, I can still check your dantian and sea of consciousness after killing you!</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows laughed hideously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura burst out from the four burly men.</p><p>A vast pressure covered the sky and the earth, shrouding the entire planet.</p><p>“Ah, what’s going on?”</p><p>what a terrifying aura! A terrifying expert has descended!</p><p>“It’s dangerous!”</p><p>The mountain Gate of Kong Xuan sect was in chaos. Many people felt the aura and were shocked to death. Some people who were cultivating were suppressed by the aura. Their bodies trembled and they spat out blood.</p><p>“Third level of the Godking realm. They’re all third level godkings!”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya cried out in shock.</p><p>The other Divine King elders were also shocked and their faces changed.</p><p>These four burly men were all third level Godking realm experts. In the Qin Tian star region, they were the deans of the Yimo Academy and the sect master of the indestructible sword sect. They were definitely Overlord level experts. However, four of them had come all of a sudden.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor was indeed terrifying. They could even casually send out a third level Godking. Moreover, it seemed like their status wasn’t very high.</p><p>“It seems that I can only let the bone Devil come!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>In this situation, he could only let the bone demon attack and force the other party to retreat. Then, he would bring the entire Kong Xuan sect to find a place to hide.</p><p>Other than this method, there was no other way.</p><p>hehe, a bunch of country bumpkins who haven’t seen the world. A few third level divine kings scared you to this extent!</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming and the rest’s expressions change drastically, as if they had been frightened, the young man with the scale between his eyebrows felt pleased and could not help but mock them.</p><p>now, I’ll give you one last chance. Open your storage rings and your dantian and sea of consciousness for us to check, and we can spare your lives!</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows continued to speak coldly.</p><p>The expressions of Yue Wu Ya and the other Kong Xuan sect elders and inner sect elders kept changing.</p><p>The other side had four third level Divine King realm experts. Once they made a move, they would die without a doubt.</p><p>Therefore, they were already hesitating. Compared to being killed, having their dantian and sea of consciousness checked was not unacceptable.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s attitude was very firm and they were hesitant.</p><p>Lu Ming had you long behind him.</p><p>“I’ll give you three breaths of time. If you don’t agree after three breaths, you’ll die!”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows said coldly.</p><p>The expressions of Yue Wuya and the others changed drastically. They looked at Lu Ming, then at the young man with the scale between his eyebrows. They were extremely anxious.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill!   the scale youth spoke once more, his eyes radiating cold killing intent.</p><p>“Qin Wushang, you’re really impressive. You came to the Qin heaven star region to act like a tyrant, hehe!”</p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice came from afar.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his brows shouted coldly as he looked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>There was a sword light flying toward them at an astonishing speed.</p><p>In the next moment, the sword light receded, and a combat sword appeared in the starry sky.</p><p>The Battle Sword was 10000 meters long and incomparably huge. Five figures stood on the Battle Sword.</p><p>A young man and four burly men.</p><p>“Wu Zifeng!”</p><p>Lu Ming, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the rest were a little shocked.</p><p>The young man on the sword was really Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“Miss Qingxiang, Lu Ming, Grandpa Yue …”</p><p>Wu Zifeng stepped down and greeted Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang. Finally, he bowed to Yue Wuya.</p><p>“Zifeng, you’re here. Good, good, good!”</p><p>Seeing Wu Zifeng, Yue Wuya was overjoyed. He said ” good ” three times in a row, and his whole body seemed to be completely relaxed.</p><p>“Wu Zifeng, it’s you!”</p><p>The young man with the scale between his brows could not help but exclaim when he saw Wu Zifeng, as if he knew him.</p><p>“Qin Wushang, now, get lost!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng shouted indifferently.</p><p>The young man with the scale between his eyebrows was Qin Wushang.</p><p>Wu Zifeng, I’m here to investigate the case of the stolen treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Do you want to interfere? ”</p><p>Qin Wushang said coldly.</p><p>don’t use the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to pressure me. You can lie to others, but you can’t lie to me. You’re just an ordinary disciple of the Qin family. You can’t represent the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Don’t use a chicken feather as a token of authority and show off in front of us!</p><p>Wu Zifeng sneered.</p><p>At the same time, the four burly men behind Wu Zifeng also erupted with a shocking aura. They were all third level divine kings.</p><p>“It seems like Wu Zifeng is also from the great void Holy dynasty!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In the past, he already knew that Wu Zifeng was not from the Qin heaven Starfield. It turned out that he was from the great void sacred dynasty, and his background was more powerful than he had imagined. Even Qin Wushang seemed to be quite afraid of Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Qin Wushang’s expression was unsightly.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion had a vast territory. Under it, there were naturally many powerful forces.</p><p>These forces all existed in the form of clans.</p><p>Many large and ancient clans helped the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion rule the vast territory.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
