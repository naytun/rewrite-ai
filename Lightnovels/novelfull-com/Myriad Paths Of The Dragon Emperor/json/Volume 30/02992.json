I heard that he has already reached the half-step Divine King realm. I wonder which door he will pass through!”</p><p>it’s gold ingot. Gold ingot has already been to star-moon ancient city once. Last time, he entered through the earth gate. This time, he’s most likely going to charge at the heaven Gate!</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it!”</p><p>Many people were discussing and looking at the other golden-robed young man.</p><p>The young man was tall and sturdy. He was Jin Yuan, one of the four heroes of the Jin clan.</p><p>The four heroes of the Jin clan were not ranked according to their cultivation, but by their talent.</p><p>In terms of cultivation, there were many people in the younger generation of the Jin family who were above Jin Xing.</p><p>Jin Yuan placed his hands behind his back. He obviously didn’t plan to attack now.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After Jin Xing blocked a wave of attacks from the Earth’s gate, there were no more abnormalities on the Earth’s gate. He continued to move forward and stepped into the passage behind the gate.</p><p>However, he did not enter star-moon ancient city through the passageway. Instead, he stood there and watched.</p><p>In fact, among the people who had passed through the gate, almost none of them had entered star-moon ancient city. They were all standing in the passageway to watch.</p><p>This time, they would be able to stay in star-moon ancient city for ten years. They had plenty of time, so they were not in a hurry.</p><p>“You old members are still not moving? Let me see if your potential has improved after so many years!”</p><p>At this time, Bai Li spoke and looked at the old members.</p><p>Talent was not always the same.</p><p>Generally speaking, one’s talent was determined by the heavens, but in fact, it was not necessarily so.</p><p>In the world, there were some rare treasures that could increase one’s potential and accumulate more potential.</p><p>Some treasures could even increase one’s comprehension.</p><p>Lu Ming’s comprehension had improved when he participated in the war of transportation in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The most important thing was Shen power.</p><p>The talents of those who controlled divine-grade divine power could also be improved as their degree of awakening of divine power increased.</p><p>Just think about it, those primitive gods that were born at the beginning of the universe had such terrifying talents. Within the divine-grade divine power, there were traces of primitive gods.</p><p>When divine power was awakened, the cultivator’s innate talent would also increase greatly.</p><p>So, just because he couldn’t last time didn’t mean he couldn’t now.</p><p>He couldn’t pass through the human gate last time, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t do it now.</p><p>Bai Li wanted to see how much progress those old members had made.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>As soon as Bai Li finished speaking, an old member stepped out.</p><p>This person released his aura and was a ninth-level celestial deity. He walked towards the human gate with a solemn expression.</p><p>The last time he came here, he didn’t pass through the human gate. He had to climb through the dog gate in humiliation. This time, he must pass through the human gate.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He stepped into the human gate, and instantly, the human gate lit up, and a divine light slashed at him.</p><p>He let out an angry roar and tried his best to block the divine light.</p><p>In the end, he was severely injured and coughed up a large amount of blood. However, he managed to block it and the divine light was destroyed by him.</p><p>“Hahaha, I passed, I passed!”</p><p>The young man laughed wildly and stepped into the passage, his face full of excitement.</p><p>He had not passed the last time. This time, he had cultivated hard. The degree of Shen power awakening had increased and he had finally passed through the human gate.</p><p>The eyes of many old members lit up as they saw hope.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Immediately, another old member walked towards the human gate.</p><p>This senior member had also failed to pass through the human gate last time. He had entered through the dog gate. When he saw the young man in front of him pass through the human gate, his confidence was greatly boosted.</p><p>However, when he stepped through the human gate and was attacked, he let out a blood-curdling screech and was sent flying out. He was severely injured.</p><p>He had failed!</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>This person roared angrily, extremely unwilling.</p><p>He had passed through the dog’s Gate last time, and this time, he had to pass through the dog’s Gate again. His face was burning.</p><p>After all, it wasn’t that easy to improve one’s talent. The young man who had been the first to go up had been very confident. As for the person behind him, although his cultivation had improved, his talent had not improved. Of course, he had failed.</p><p>The remaining people’s faces turned grave.</p><p>Then, more and more people came forward.</p><p>However, compared to the new members, the old members had a much higher chance of success. More than half of them passed through the human gate.</p><p>Of course, those who didn’t pass through the human gate had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>Some of the older members had even started to attack the Earth’s gate and many of them had succeeded.</p><p>These successful people had all awakened their divine power to a high degree. They had reached 80% to 90% and were about to awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>“Look, gold ingot is going to make a move!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, causing everyone’s hearts to tremble.</p><p>As expected, Jin Yuan moved. Step by step, he walked toward the four doors.</p><p>“Which gate is he going to choose? Earth or heaven?”</p><p>Someone murmured, and everyone started to guess.</p><p>“He chose the Heaven’s Gate!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed because Jin Yuan’s figure was walking toward the heaven Gate.</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>This time, there was already a person who didn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth who had entered the heavenly gate. Other than being killed in the end, no one else had entered the heavenly gate.</p><p>Gold ingot, can you succeed?</p><p>Last time, Jin Yuan had stepped through the earth gate.</p><p>As he neared the Heaven’s Gate, a bright golden light appeared on Jin Yuan’s body. Layers of golden divine power enveloped him, and an ancient aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Bai Li exclaimed in a low voice, and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“What? Origin divine power factor? Jin Yuan has awakened the origin divine power factor?”</p><p>so terrifying. He can awaken the origin divine power factor at the half-step Divine King realm. No wonder he is one of the four heroes of the Jin family!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>It was very, very difficult to awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Even geniuses had to enter the divine King realm before they could awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>On the other hand, the majority of people might not even be able to awaken the divine power factor even if they became God kings.</p><p>There were very, very few people below the Godking level who could awaken the origin divine power factor. Every single one of them was a genius among geniuses.</p><p>Jin Yuan was one of those people.</p><p>the last time he came to star-moon ancient city, Jinyuan had yet to awaken the origin divine power factor. This time, he has successfully awakened the origin divine power factor. His talent has increased greatly, and it is very likely that he will pass through the Heaven’s Gate!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jin Yuan had already stepped into the heavenly gate.</p><p>The heaven Gate, earth gate, and human gate were all different.</p><p>The front section of the Heaven’s Gate didn’t have any abnormalities.</p><p>When Jin Yuan was halfway there, he suddenly stopped and started to move.</p><p>It began!</p><p>Everyone knew that the Heaven’s Gate’s assessment had just begun.</p><p>Everyone held their breath and watched quietly. They were guessing whether gold ingot could pass through the heavenly gate.</p><p>Every time they came to star-moon ancient city, there were very few people who could pass through the heaven Gate. Sometimes, not even one person could pass through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
