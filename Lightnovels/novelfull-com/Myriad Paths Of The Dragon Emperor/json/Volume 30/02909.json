Dragon Boat Mountain brought them into the teleportation formation and arrived on a planet near planet Kong Xuan. Then, they flew toward planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>“Activate the planet protection array!”</p><p>As soon as Dragon boat’s Mount landed in the Kong Xuan sect, his voice spread throughout the entire sect.</p><p>“Sect master, it’s the sect master!”</p><p>sect master has given the order to activate the star Protection formation!</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect was filled with noise, and powerful auras soared into the sky.</p><p>In the next moment, pillars of light shot into the sky from different parts of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>There were a total of 360 light pillars scattered across the planet. This was the formation base of the formation.</p><p>Each of the 360 pillars of light was ten thousand miles wide, and they formed a huge formation that enveloped the entire Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>This was the planet protection array. It was similar to the sect protection array that Lu Ming had encountered in the past. However, this kind of array was many times stronger. It could cover an entire star.</p><p>In fact, powerful forces like the Qin heavenly thirteen clans, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan all had planet protection arrays to protect the safety of the main star.</p><p>As soon as the star Protection array was activated, the teleportation array that Lu Ming and the rest had just come out of glowed. Then, the sect Masters of the three Overlord forces and other experts arrived.</p><p>They flew towards planet Kong Xuan and stood outside of it.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, hand over the star core!”</p><p>The college chief of the unique devil Academy roared and attacked. He struck out with his palm. A huge palm that covered an area of at least several million miles was formed and smashed towards Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge palm struck the great formation, causing it to light up. Rays of terrifying divine light shot out and clashed with the palm of the Dean of the unique demon Academy. In the end, the huge hand was riddled with holes and dissipated in the air.</p><p>Seeing that he had blocked the attack of the headmaster of the wing demon Academy, the other members of the Kong Xuan sect all heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain, hand over the star core. Do you think that you can stop so many of us with just a great formation? ”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s headmaster furiously shouted.</p><p>“Attention, all of you. Activate the array with all your might. The mission I’m giving you is to guard and defend for half a month. After half a month, I have a way to repel the enemy. All of you can go. Lu Ming, stay behind!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain instructed.</p><p>After that, the divine King experts, the Supreme universe master, Ouyang Qingxiang, and the others left the place one after another, leaving only Lu Ming and the Dragon boats behind.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Outside the formation, the Dean of the unique devil Academy shouted angrily and launched another attack.</p><p>&Nbsp; in addition, the sect leader of the indestructible sword sect, the Lord of the boundless sacred land, and the other God kings also began to attack.</p><p>One after another, terrifying attacks rained down on Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>Each of these attacks was extremely terrifying. Lu Ming felt that each of them could turn him into ashes and leave nothing behind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, follow me!”</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain waved his sleeves and flew towards a certain place in the Kong Xuan sect with Lu Ming.</p><p>“We’re finally going to start!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the celestial God-level, he reckoned that the Dragon boats were about to make their move.</p><p>The bone demon speculated that the Dragon Boat Mountain’s physical body had already been occupied by another powerful existence, and that existence’s main body should have been suppressed by the trapping Dragon Rising to the heaven formation. The Dragon Boat Mountain’s goal was to rescue its main body.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at a place.</p><p>“Eh? The dark Dragon secret realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>This was the entrance to the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had obtained the ” quantity ” formula in the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>Could it be that the rising Dragon array mentioned by the Dragon Boat Mountain was in the dark Dragon secret realm?</p><p>Lu Ming’s guess was right. The Dragon Boat Mountain brought Lu Ming into the dark Dragon secret realm in a single step. After entering the dark Dragon secret realm, they flew in one direction and soon arrived in front of a huge mountain range.</p><p>This mountain range was extremely huge, as if a Divine Dragon was lying on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Dragon Boat Mountain suddenly made a move. With a wave of its hand, a divine light slashed towards the mountain range.</p><p>Just as the divine light was about to hit the mountain range, the mountain range seemed to come to life. It turned into a Divine Dragon and flew into the sky, disappearing into the firmament.</p><p>Following that, a light screen appeared in the mountain range area earlier, blocking the divine light from Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>From a distance, it looked like a light shield that was covering the ground.</p><p>Rising Dragon array!</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain muttered to himself, his eyes flickering with heat and anticipation.</p><p>it’s really the rising Dragon array. There’s definitely a powerful being suppressed in this array. I was right!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the bone Devil’s voice sounded. Of course, he was communicating with his soul, and the bone Devil’s control was very subtle, so the Dragon boats didn’t notice.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, why did you bring me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked despite knowing the answer.</p><p>haha, I’m lending it to you, of course. An Army that has been trained for a thousand days can only be used once. The dark Dragon blood Curse that I’ve cultivated in your body for so long can finally be put to use.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain laughed loudly, and within his laughter, there was an incomparable ferocity and madness.</p><p>Following that, Dragon Boat Mountain’s hands rapidly formed seals. At the same time, a dazzling light burst out from Lu Ming’s body. Then, black runes spread out like tiny snakes.</p><p>The dark Dragon blood Curse was activated!</p><p>Countless black runes covered Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>Dragon boat’s Mountain waved his hand and Lu Ming flew out, heading towards the Coiling Dragon Rising to the heaven formation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When Lu Ming neared the rising Dragon array, the array shook and burst out with rays of light that charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He could sense that the light contained a terrifying power that could destroy everything. Lu Ming would definitely not be able to withstand it.</p><p>However, at this moment, the pitch-black dark Dragon blood Curse on Lu Ming’s body seemed to come to life. It extended from Lu Ming’s body and entangled with the light of the rising Dragon formation. They were like living creatures, fighting each other.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure entered the rising Dragon array without a hitch.</p><p>hahaha, the dark Dragon blood Curse can indeed counter the rising Dragon array. I can finally escape, I can finally escape!</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain laughed crazily and vented some of his emotions. He seemed to have gone mad.</p><p>Following that, the Dragon Boat Mountain formed hand seals again. The dark Dragon blood Curse on Lu Ming’s body shone brightly.</p><p>Then, a terrifying suction force was produced. At this moment, all of Lu Ming’s blood, essence, energy, and spirit were surging towards the dark Dragon blood Curse as if they were about to be devoured by it.</p><p>“Dragon Boat Mountain, you said you wouldn’t harm my life. If you continue like this, I won’t be able to hold on any longer.”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
