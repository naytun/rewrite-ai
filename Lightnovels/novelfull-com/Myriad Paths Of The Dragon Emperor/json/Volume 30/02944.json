One look and one could tell that they were fierce characters.</p><p>“The four of you must be outsiders. I’ve never seen you before!”</p><p>One of the burly men with a scar on his face swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the other three. When he saw Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong, his eyes were burning with a fiery flame.</p><p>“That’s right, we’re outsiders and have just come here to train!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered casually.</p><p>“Just arrived? Nonsense!”</p><p>The scar-faced man suddenly shouted as a ferocious smile appeared on his face. He stared at Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong and said, some time ago, two female thieves appeared in the devil general city and stole the treasure of the city Lord. I saw that their figures were very similar to those two female thieves. Now, I will arrest them and bring them back for interrogation!</p><p>“Brothers, take him down!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared.</p><p>“Hehehe, two female thieves, just surrender!”</p><p>The other three Men in Black armor had lecherous looks on their faces. He walked towards Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong with a smile.</p><p>Now, even a fool could see that the knife-scarred man and the other three had obviously taken a fancy to Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong’s looks and wanted to get their hands on them. The so-called female thief was just an excuse they made up.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng’s anger soared to the sky. His aura rushed out and he threw a punch.</p><p>a mere seventh stage true God also wants to make a move on me. Courting death!</p><p>The man with the knife scar sneered and smacked out a palm. A terrifying palm force surged towards Wu Zifeng.</p><p>Third level celestial deity!</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s cultivation was at the third level of celestial deity, much stronger than Wu Zifeng. No matter how much of a genius Wu Zifeng was, he could not make up for it.</p><p>Seeing this palm fall, even if Wu Zifeng did not die, he would be crippled.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure appeared in front of Wu Zifeng. With a wave of his hand, the knife-scarred man’s palm force was dispersed.</p><p>“Eh? Brat, you still dare to fight back? you don’t know what’s good for you. Brothers, leave these two to me. You guys take those two girls!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man shouted.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The other three burly men attacked at the same time. They stretched out their demonic claws and grabbed towards Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong.</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a move. The other three burly men were only first-tier celestial gods and were no match for Qiu Yue.</p><p>As expected, a snow-white blade light bloomed from Qiu Yue’s hand.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>A blood-red light burst out and three miserable screams rang out. The three black-armored men were forced to retreat.</p><p>The three Men in Black armor each had one hand cut off by Qiu Yue.</p><p>&Nbsp; moreover, Qiu Yue’s attack contained God energy, making it very difficult for the three men to recover.</p><p>“Bitch!”</p><p>The three Men in Black armor kept roaring in anger.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said coldly. With a wave of her hand, another blade light was shot out.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The three black-armored men’s expressions changed drastically, and they quickly retreated, trying to Dodge.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue’s attack was shockingly fast. In comparison, the speed of the three Men in Black armor was like a snail.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>Another three “PU Chi” sounds were heard. Then, everyone saw the three burly Men in Black armor standing there stiffly, not moving.</p><p>Blood seeped out of their foreheads, and there was no longer any life in their bodies.</p><p>The three black-armored men had fallen. In that instant, their souls had been destroyed by Qiu Yue.</p><p>“You … You actually dare to kill one of our fiend general guards? you’re seeking death!”</p><p>The knife-scarred man roared and howled. A violent aura filled the air.</p><p>“I originally wanted to investigate in secret and not cause any trouble, but I just had to meet someone who’s looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step toward the man with the knife scar and threw a punch.</p><p>“Devil general blade!”</p><p>The scar-faced man roared. He unsheathed his saber and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, although the knife-scarred man’s cultivation was at the third tier celestial God Realm, which was the same as Lu Ming’s, he was only the most ordinary celestial God who controlled King-grade divine power. His combat strength was far from Lu Ming’s.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon flew out and charged at the knife-scarred man.</p><p>Faced with Lu Ming, the man with the knife scar could not even withstand a single blow. As the nine-clawed Divine Dragon charged past, all of the man’s attacks were instantly destroyed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s body was torn apart by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, and he died on the spot.</p><p>The knife-scarred man’s group of four was completely annihilated.</p><p>The streets were already filled with people who were there to watch the show. At this time, they were all discussing.</p><p>these four young men are so bold. They even dare to kill the general fiend guards. They’re finished!</p><p>“I’m afraid that the other fiend general guards have already been alerted and will be here soon!”</p><p>As if to confirm this sentence, an explosive roar came from the depths of the devil general city.</p><p>close the city gate and activate the formation. Anyone who dares to kill my general demon guards will be turned to ashes!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the city gates around the demon City were quickly closed, and a layer of light shield rose in the sky above the demon City.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Powerful auras burst out from all directions of the general Demon City. Black figures rushed toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Wu Zifeng and Yue Linglong’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>Qiu Yue and Lu Ming, on the other hand, were calm.</p><p>In the entire Magic City mountain, only the city Lord was a Divine King expert.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s current strength, he had nothing to fear as long as it was not a God King. At the very least, it was still possible for him to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>From all directions, figures flew over. They were all big Men in Black armor from all races.</p><p>“The Fiend guard Army has arrived!”</p><p>The surrounding people were shocked. Many people retreated to make way for the demonic guard.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were surrounded by the demonic guards from all directions.</p><p>“There’s quite a number of people!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and realized that there were three thousand general fiend guards.</p><p>The three thousand fiend general guards were all at the heavenly God Realm. This power could be said to be very shocking.</p><p>general Demon City is only one of the thirty-six satellite cities of the demonic Capital Mountain. It’s really amazing that it has such a powerful force …</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>One should know that the strongest person on Magic City mountain was only a first level Divine King. Lu Ming could not help but be amazed that he had such a large Army of heavenly gods under his command.</p><p>perhaps, it’s related to the demon night spring? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Mo du mountain had mo yequan, so he was definitely very rich. It wasn’t impossible for him to gather many heavenly God Realm experts and form an Army.</p><p>“Brat, you killed my fiend general guard!”</p><p>A particularly burly man stepped out. His violent aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This person was the general of the general fiend guards and had a full cultivation of the sixth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently.</p><p>good, very good. In general fiend city, you dare to kill my general fiend guards. Very good!</p><p>The general of the general fiend guard opened his mouth and shouted, ” “Attack! Kill the man, leave the woman!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
