He pondered for a moment before he continued,”Lu Ming, you should know about the dark ice Clan, right?”</p><p>“Dark ice Clan? You mean the clan that betrayed the ice Soul Clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He still remembered that he had been sent to the ice Soul Clan on a mission to help the ice Soul Clan go to the ancestral land and retrieve the ice jade cold heart. In the ancestral land of the ice Soul Clan, he had met The Prodigy of the dark ice Clan. The two of them had fought over the ice jade cold heart.</p><p>Could it be related to the dark ice Clan?</p><p>I speculate that the one who stole the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was the dark ice Clan. These years, the dark ice Clan has been weakening day by day, and the nine absolute divine crystal can help the dark ice Clan rise again. It can even defeat my clan and return to the peak of the Qin Tian Starfield!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“Clan leader Bing, is this your speculation or is there evidence?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a sip of tea and asked calmly.</p><p>He naturally wouldn’t easily believe the other party’s words.</p><p>The ice Soul Clan and the dark ice Clan had a deep hatred for each other. They both wanted to destroy each other. If the ice Soul Clan wanted to frame the dark ice Clan, it was possible that they could take the opportunity to destroy the other.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan smiled when he heard Lu Ming’s question. He was an experienced man who had lived for countless years. He naturally knew what Lu Ming was thinking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you might think that I will frame the dark ice Clan. However, this matter concerns the survival of the Qin heaven Star Zone and my clan. I’m not a fool. There are plenty of opportunities to deal with the dark ice Clan. Why would I choose this time?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan smiled and continued, ” the dark ice Clan used to be very active and often had conflicts with us. But recently, they’ve been hiding. They’ve hidden all of their clansmen. They haven’t done anything yet. This is very suspicious!</p><p>I suspect that they’ve obtained a treasure and want to accumulate power in the dark, waiting for the day to explode!</p><p>clan leader Bing, even if it was the dark ice clan’s doing, with the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s defense, how could the dark ice Clan have stolen the treasure? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>If the dark ice Clan was so powerful that they could steal the treasures from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, they would have exterminated the ice Soul Clan and unified the Qin heaven star realm.</p><p>this is the key to the problem. I suspect that there is a traitor in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion who is in cahoots with outsiders. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for outsiders to steal the treasure from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said in a low voice.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly.</p><p>To be honest, Lu Ming had also thought of this before.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King Manor was one of the 27 Heavenly King manors in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Not to mention Heavenly King Nine cuts ‘cultivation, even the guards of nine cuts Heavenly King mansion were extremely terrifying and unfathomable. It was almost impossible for outsiders to steal the treasure from the guards without anyone knowing.</p><p>There was only one reason-there was a traitor in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion who was in cahoots with outsiders. This was the only way to steal the treasure without anyone knowing.</p><p>However, which force in the Qin heaven Starfield would collude with the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s people?</p><p>in the Qin heaven Starfield, to be honest, whether it’s my ice Soul Clan, the Scarlet Flame clan, or the Qin heaven thirteen clans, they’re not worth mentioning in the eyes of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. We don’t have the qualifications to make friends with the major forces and aristocratic families of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>however, the dark ice Clan is an exception. After the dark ice Clan was defeated, they left the Qin heaven star region and wandered to other places. It took a long time before they returned to the Qin heaven star region. Therefore, the dark ice Clan is most likely to be acquainted with people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>furthermore, my clan has always secretly sent people to keep an eye on the dark ice Clan. A while ago, the dark ice Clan was very active and would often send people out of the Qin heaven star system to the territory where the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is located. This is the biggest suspicion!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan explained.</p><p>“It’s actually like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were also bright.</p><p>After hearing what the patriarch of the ice Soul Clan said, he really thought that the dark ice Clan was the most suspicious.</p><p>if it’s really the dark ice Clan, then why did the experts of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion collude with the dark ice Clan to steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? what benefits would they get from doing this? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked. He still had many doubts.</p><p>I’m not sure about this. I’m also confused. On the surface, it doesn’t seem to benefit those people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. However, I guess they must have a purpose for doing this!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan also frowned.</p><p>however, all of this is just my speculation. Without any evidence, it’s not enough to be trusted. The people of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion will not believe me.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan sighed.</p><p>“Chief Bing, what does this have to do with you inviting me here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>Even if the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was right, it had nothing to do with him. What kind of help could he provide?</p><p>first of all, we have to find evidence of the dark ice Race stealing the treasures. But to find evidence, it’s almost impossible in the Qin heaven Star Domain. Only at the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor can we possibly find evidence!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>“Clan leader Bing, you want me to go to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to find evidence?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed as he asked.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>yes! the ice Soul clan’s patriarch nodded. our clan has planted an informer in the dark ice Clan, but the dark ice Clan has also planted an informer in our clan. As long as we send someone to the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion, we’ll immediately alert the other party. We’ll alert the enemy instead!</p><p>also, it’s not suitable for those with high cultivation to head to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They will also alert the dark ice Race.</p><p>only those of the younger generation who go to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion with the excuse of training and looking for other heaven’s favorites will not attract the attention of others. This is because there are many such things in every generation!</p><p>Lu Ming understood now. The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan wanted Lu Ming to go to the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion with the excuse of training to investigate the case of the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion’s treasure being stolen and find evidence of the dark ice clan’s theft.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was stunned. He did not expect Lu Ming to agree so readily.</p><p>He invited Lu Ming over only to raise this suggestion. As for whether Lu Ming would agree to it, he would not force him. He did not expect that Lu Ming would agree without the slightest hesitation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
