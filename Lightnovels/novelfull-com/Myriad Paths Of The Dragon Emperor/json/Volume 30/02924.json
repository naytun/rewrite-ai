Their foundations were deep, and their strength was unfathomable. They were far from what the Qin heaven Starfield could compare to.</p><p>The Wu family and the Qin family were both aristocratic families like this.</p><p>However, Qin Wushang’s status in the Qin clan was not high. Just as Wu Zifeng had said, he did not mix well in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He only came to the Qin heaven star field to show off his power and did not represent the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Wu Zifeng, it seems that you have to intervene. This is about the nine absolute divine crystal. If something goes wrong, you won’t be able to bear the responsibility. Not to mention you, even your Wu family can’t bear the responsibility!</p><p>Qin Wushang said coldly.</p><p>you don’t have to worry about that. I can also guarantee that the Kong Xuan sect is not the one who stole the nine absolute divine crystal. You can get lost now.</p><p>Wu Zifeng said.</p><p>“Good, very good. I can leave, but …”</p><p>Qin Wushang gritted his teeth. Halfway through his sentence, he suddenly turned to look at Lu Ming. Then, his body trembled and he rushed toward Lu Ming like a stream of light, sending a palm toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The force whistled and the palm force pressed down on Lu Ming with the force of mountains and seas.</p><p>“Sixth level heavenly deity, sacred grade divine power …”</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming had determined Qin Wushang’s strength.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming did not have time to think. He could only channel his divine energy and wave his palm to resist.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not expect that Qin Wushang would suddenly attack him. In a hurry, he could only use thirty percent of his divine power.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two palms collided. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he retreated a thousand meters before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>“Qin Wushang, what are you doing?”</p><p>Wu Zifeng shouted angrily.</p><p>“What are you doing? This lowly ant doesn’t know his place and dares to talk back to me. I won’t pursue the matter with the Kong Xuan sect today, but this person must die!”</p><p>Qin Wushang shouted. His face was ferocious and filled with strong killing intent.</p><p>With that, Qin Wushang’s aura became even stronger. He stepped forward, and waves of powerful pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“This person isn’t weaker than the Supreme universe!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought in his mind.</p><p>Qin Wushang’s cultivation base was at the sixth level of the heavenly God Realm. The divine power he controlled was of the divine grade. He was a genius on the same level as the Supreme universe.</p><p>However, from Wu Zifeng’s tone, Qin Wushang seemed to be doing very well in the Qin family.</p><p>If such a genius was only average in the Qin clan, then how many geniuses did the Qin clan have?</p><p>Or rather, how many geniuses were there in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, or even the entire great void Holy dynasty?</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ming’s imagination was running wild. He even had some desire in his heart.</p><p>Currently, among the younger generation in the Qin heaven Star Zone, Lu Ming was almost standing at the peak.</p><p>As long as mo jiuye, sword Dao Wuji, and cangyan pojun had not broken through, he was confident that he could defeat them.</p><p>Thus, he yearned for stronger opponents that could give him pressure and make him stronger.</p><p>“As long as I’m here, don’t even think about touching a single hair on Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng said coldly and waved his hand.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Behind Wu Zifeng, a burly man stepped out. His violent aura burst forth and blocked Qin Wushang’s path.</p><p>However, immediately after, a burly man behind Qin Wushang also stepped out. His aura erupted like a volcano and broke through the aura of the Wu family’s experts. Qin Wushang regained his freedom.</p><p>let the younger generation solve their own problems. We, the older generation, just watch!</p><p>The big man from the Qin family said coldly as he stared at the experts from the Wu family.</p><p>The experts from both sides were in a confrontation. However, the people that both sides brought were about the same and their cultivation levels were about the same. It just so happened that they were in a stalemate and could not interfere in the matter between Lu Ming and Qin Wushang.</p><p>haha, that’s right. The matters of the younger generation should be settled by themselves. I want to see what gave a lowly ant from the Qin heaven star system the courage to speak to me like that!</p><p>Qin Wushang laughed out loud. He raised his sixth level celestial deity cultivation to the peak and stomped towards Lu Ming with a face full of confidence.</p><p>He could tell that Lu Ming was only a first-tier celestial deity. In his opinion, a first-tier celestial deity would not be able to withstand a single blow.</p><p>“Qin Wushang, you dare …”</p><p>Wu Zifeng shouted. However, his cultivation was not as good as Qin Wushang’s, so he could not wipe his hands.</p><p>“Brother Wu, since he wants to fight, I’ll fight with him. You don’t need to interfere!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hand and stopped Wu Zifeng.</p><p>hehe, kid, you have some guts. However, you want to fight me with trash like you? kneel down!</p><p>Qin Wushang snorted and raised his hand again. A huge palm print formed and pressed down on Lu Ming, trying to force him to his knees.</p><p>“You’re the one who should kneel!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. At the same time, the ten divine flames in his body burned fiercely.</p><p>The ten types of divine powers circulated wildly and gathered together, rushing toward Lu Ming’s arm.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming pointed his finger and a Spear’s gleam shot up into the sky, piercing through the nine Heavens and the starry sky. It was brighter than a shooting star.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear radiance and Qin Wushang’s palm print collided with a violent boom. Qin Wushang’s palm print exploded and disappeared.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qin Wushang was shocked.</p><p>Why did Lu Ming’s aura suddenly increase by a few times? the attack that he unleashed was also extremely shocking, crushing his attack in one fell swoop.</p><p>The people who came with Qin Wushang could not help but widen their eyes, their faces filled with shock.</p><p>so powerful. Lu Ming is really getting more and more powerful!</p><p>Wu Zifeng was also very surprised.</p><p>you, with just this bit of strength, I still thought how strong the geniuses of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s faint voice was filled with mockery.</p><p>kid, you’re quite strong. However, I didn’t use my full strength just now. Now, you’ll regret it. Seven injury divine fist!</p><p>Qin Wushang shouted and changed his attack. He clenched his fists and a strange light emanated from his body and gathered on his fists.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Qin Wushang threw two punches in a row. The two fist prints were like two meteors, blasting toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was fast, but its power was shocking.</p><p>This level of combat strength was already not below the full strength of the Supreme universe. In the Qin heaven star region, he was definitely considered a top genius.</p><p>However, with Lu Ming’s current abilities, it was a piece of cake for him to deal with an opponent like Supreme universe.</p><p>Lu Ming didn’t even need to use his ancient God Body and the battle character formula to multiply his combat power.</p><p>It was enough to rely on the ten types of divine power and various divine skills and secret techniques.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>Lu Ming also threw a punch.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar reverberated through the firmament. A huge nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared and pounced at Qin Wushang with a furious roar.</p><p>Lu Ming then threw another punch and another nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared.</p><p>The two nine-clawed divine Dragons twisted their bodies and pounced forward. The nine dragon claws on their abdomens struck out in succession and let out terrifying howls as if sharp swords were piercing through the air.</p><p>In reality, that was indeed the case. Now that Lu Ming had cultivated the indestructible sword technique and controlled the indestructible sword force, his divine power contained a terrifying sword force attack.</p><p>The inextinguishable sword force acted on the nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s sharp claws, making them as sharp as a sword. It elevated Lu Ming’s attack power to another level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
