The array disc above his head glowed as he used all his strength to control the rising Dragon array to suppress the dark Dragon. He had no choice but to divert more divine power to resist the rising Dragon array.</p><p>In this way, there was much less divine power to use against Lu Ming.</p><p>“Now, watch me, I’m going to fight too!”</p><p>The bone demon roared and emitted a terrifying black light. He opened his mouth and spat out an ugly jar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The earthen jar trembled slightly, exuding an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p>This aura made Lu Ming’s entire body tense up as if he was facing an extremely terrifying expert.</p><p>Then, a ray of light emanated from the jar and enveloped Lu Ming. This ray of light could help Lu Ming resist the dark Dragon’s divine power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t block it. I’ll go and destroy his soul!”</p><p>The bone demon cried out and rushed into the earthen jar. It then controlled the jar and soared into the sky, disappearing from Lu Ming’s sight. It seemed to be flying towards you Long’s head.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Not long after, the dark Dragon let out an earth-shattering roar. The divine power that was attacking Lu Ming was reduced by a lot.</p><p>“Ahhhhhhhh, Who are you? Who are you?”</p><p>The dark Dragon kept roaring, as if it was terrified.</p><p>His huge body kept struggling and rolling, slowly rushing out of the rising Dragon array.</p><p>Slowly, his head left the rising Dragon array, which made the dark Dragon struggle even more.</p><p>Waves of divine energy whistled and charged at Lu Ming, causing the light shield around Lu Ming’s body to shake continuously.</p><p>“Bone demon, you have to be quick, or I’ll die Here!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart, but there was nothing he could do. He could only control the rising Dragon array with all his might to suppress the dark Dragon.</p><p>Just like that, a few moments passed. You long had already left the Coiling Dragon Rising to the heaven formation by more than half. His struggle and counterattack became more and more intense.</p><p>“Ah, no, no, I beg you, spare me …”</p><p>At this moment, you long let out a terrified scream and begged for mercy.</p><p>“Disappear!”</p><p>Then, bone’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The dark Dragon let out an indignant roar. In the next moment, the divine power that was charging at Lu Ming all retreated and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Did you succeed?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the bone demon controlled the jar and appeared in front of Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, did you succeed?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hopefully.</p><p>“It’s a success! I’ve finally destroyed the dark dragon’s soul. This time, it was really dangerous. It’s a pity that I’ve suffered heavy losses and my vitality has been greatly damaged!”</p><p>The bone Devil cried out in a ‘miserable’ manner.</p><p>“Every time you make a move, you say you’ve suffered heavy losses.”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? I’m telling you, I’ve really suffered a great loss this time. In the future, you must compensate me well, understand?”</p><p>The bone Devil roared.</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ll definitely compensate you well!”</p><p>Lu Ming could only smile apologetically.</p><p>This time, it was all thanks to the bone demon. Otherwise, Lu Ming would definitely be dead and you Long’s plan would be carried out perfectly.</p><p>“Senior bone, what should we do now?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>this Dark Dragon’s corpse is good stuff. I can live here for a while. You control the rising Dragon array and let the dark Dragon out. I can also control it to defeat some of the enemies outside!</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He immediately controlled the rising Dragon array and stopped suppressing the dark Dragon.</p><p>Bone demon’s figure flashed and headed towards you Long’s sea of consciousness. Then, he controlled you Long’s body and smoothly climbed out of the trapping Dragon Rising to the heaven array.</p><p>As soon as he left the rising Dragon array, Lu Ming flew out of the dark dragon’s mouth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a shocking aura erupted from you Long’s body. This aura made Lu Ming feel apprehensive. It was even stronger than the Dragon boat’s.</p><p>this you long has such terrifying strength. Now that his soul has been destroyed and he has been suppressed for so many years, he can still exert such an aura even when he is seriously injured. It’s really terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>that’s for sure. At its peak, this netherdragon was an existence that surpassed godkings!</p><p>Bone demon’s voice came from you Long’s forehead.</p><p>“An existence that surpasses Godking?”</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed and looked forward to it.</p><p>Godkings were existences that could shatter planets. How powerful would those who had surpassed godkings be?</p><p>Xie nianqing’s condition for Lu Ming was to surpass the king of gods. Only then would he be able to find her and help her!</p><p>He had to reach this realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come on up. I’ll bring you out. We’ll talk after we defeat the people who are attacking the Kong Xuan sect. You’ll have to stay in the Kong Xuan sect for a while!”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He moved and landed on you Long’s head. You long twisted his body and rushed out.</p><p>At this moment, Kong Xuan planet was in a crisis.</p><p>The leaders of the three overlords, the Yimo Academy, the immortal sword sect, and the boundless Holy Land, led some of their Godking experts and attacked the planet protecting formation of the Kong Xuan sect with all their might.</p><p>They were not the only ones. The top ten sects had also joined in and attacked the planet-protecting formation of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Although Kong Xuan sect’s planet-protecting formation was extremely powerful, there were too many powerhouses on the other side. After resisting for so long, it was already in a precarious situation and seemed to collapse at any moment.</p><p>Dragon Boat Mountain, get the hell out here! You want to stop us with just a great formation? dream on!</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief roared. The aura on his body was as deep as the ocean, and it condensed into many shocking demonic swords that slashed at the Kong Xuan sect’s planet-protecting formation.</p><p>that’s right. You want to keep the star core for yourself? no way! Hand it over!</p><p>The sect leader of the indestructible sword sect continued to unleash terrifying attacks. Each sword strike seemed to be able to split the entire Kong Xuan planet in half.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Under such a terrifying attack, Kong Xuan sect’s planet-protecting formation kept shaking.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, some parts of the Kong Xuan sect’s planet-protecting formation exploded.</p><p>“Not good, the star Protection formation is about to be broken!”</p><p>An elder of Kong Xuan sect exclaimed.</p><p>Once the planet protecting formation was broken, they would definitely not be able to withstand the siege of so many experts outside.</p><p>“Sect master, where did sect master go?”</p><p>the sect leader disappeared with Lu Ming. I wonder where they went? ”</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect was like an ant on a hot pan.</p><p>Bang! Bang …</p><p>More and more parts of the planet protecting formation exploded. Finally, with a world-shaking explosion, the planet protecting formation completely collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>The auras of the demonic Academy’s Dean, the immortal sword sect’s sect master, and other peerless experts enveloped the entire Kong Xuan sect like a storm.</p><p>Everyone from the Kong Xuan sect felt as if a huge mountain was pressing down on them. They were terrified and broke out in a cold sweat. They felt as if they were in deep trouble.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
