The sword intent on his body suddenly soared, and a bright sword light slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword radiance was tens of thousands of meters long and had a mountain-like pressure. It carried a vast sword Qi and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>As soon as he made his move, sword Dao limitless used his killing move.</p><p>Mo jiuye’s eyes brightened when he saw sword Dao Wuji attack. He immediately attacked Lu Ming with all his might.</p><p>“You guys are despicable …”</p><p>Not far away, Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. However, with her strength, she could only be anxious and could not interfere.</p><p>“Moon slaying sword, moon slaying sword …”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out a long spear in his left hand. With a long spear in each hand, he performed the moon slashing move at the same time.</p><p>One of them was aimed at sword Dao Wu Ji, while the other was aimed at mo jiuye.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack collided with mo jiuye’s and sword Dao Wuji’s attacks at the same time, creating a terrifying explosion. Lu Ming groaned and his body trembled. A powerful force surged from both sides.</p><p>In particular, his sword Dao was boundless, and he controlled divine-grade divine power. At the same time, the sword Dao he cultivated had extremely terrifying offensive power.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel that there were tiny sword Qis constantly drilling into his body and slashing at his scales, causing sparks to fly in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. His body turned rapidly and he broke away from mo jiuye and boundless sword Dao’s encirclement. Then, his divine power surged and destroyed the sword Qi on the surface of his body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji and Mo jiuye stepped out, their powerful auras pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Very good. You two want to join forces, right? then come. Even if I die, I can take one of you down with me. Which one of you should I take with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glinted coldly as he revealed a menacing killing intent. He kept scanning sword Dao Wuji and Mo jiuye.</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji and Mo jiuye’s expressions changed and they stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>The effect of this move was quite good.</p><p>Back then, he had used this move to scare off four eyes void court and Zhuo Buzhu. Now, he was using the same move again, causing mo jiuye and sword Dao limitless to be extremely wary.</p><p>Of course, this was also because he was strong in battle, so this move was effective.</p><p>If his combat strength was not up to par, he would not be able to match either mo jiuye or boundless sword Dao. The two of them could easily kill Lu Ming if they joined forces, and this move would be useless.</p><p>The main thing was that Lu Ming’s strength was extremely shocking. In a one-on-one battle, he could even suppress mo jiuye. If he really went all out, he could really take one person down with him. That was why they were so afraid.</p><p>“This fellow is trying to scare us. I don’t believe that he would really risk his life …”</p><p>Mo jiuye roared angrily. He really wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“You all joined hands to kill me, so why shouldn’t I go all out? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Mo jiuye was at a loss for words. Indeed, he was about to die, so how could he not risk his life?</p><p>“Come on, it’s not bad to drag a Son of God down with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>Boundless sword Dao did not move. He was really a little afraid. If Lu Ming went all out and perished together with him, it would really not be worth it.</p><p>Didn’t lu Ming just kill a Holy Son of the inextinguishable sword sect? what did it have to do with him?</p><p>If Lu Ming’s ability was low, he could kill him easily. Naturally, he would kill Lu Ming and win over his reputation.</p><p>However, now that Lu Ming’s ability was enough to threaten his life, he had to think twice.</p><p>“Hahaha, Lu Ming, you’re overthinking it. I saw you guys fighting just now and was itching to test your abilities. Your abilities are indeed amazing. I’m impressed. If you guys want to fight, continue. I won’t disturb you any longer!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji laughed and kept his sword intent. He retreated a hundred miles away, leaving the battlefield to Lu Ming and Mo jiuye.</p><p>“This guy is really a hypocrite …”</p><p>Mo jiuye gritted his teeth, his expression ugly.</p><p>“Mo jiuye, do you want to continue?”</p><p>Lu Ming had his eyes on mo jiuye.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, I’ll let you off today. We’ll fight again in the future!”</p><p>Mo jiuye spat out some harsh words and retreated as well, putting some distance between him and Lu Ming.</p><p>He felt a little guilty if he were to continue fighting Lu Ming alone.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and did not continue to fight with mo jiuye.</p><p>Firstly, although he could suppress mo jiuye with his strength, it was impossible for him to kill mo jiuye.</p><p>Secondly, sword Dao Wu Ji and cangyan Jun po were also watching him closely. If he was injured in the battle with mo jiuye, he had no doubt that sword Dao Wu Ji would take the opportunity to kill him.</p><p>Now was not the time for a war.</p><p>At the scene, there was a confrontation between four experts.</p><p>The others had complicated feelings.</p><p>In the past, among the Qin heaven thirteen clans, sword Dao Wuji, mo jiuye, and ashen flame Army breaker were the only ones who stood out and suppressed everyone.</p><p>Now, they knew that there would be four great experts in the Qin heaven thirteen clans. Lu Ming would be one of them.</p><p>it’s good to have one more person. Let’s follow the previous method. We’ll join forces and break open the stone tower’s door. If there are treasures inside, we’ll rely on our own abilities. How about it? ”</p><p>Cang Yan said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Then make your move!”</p><p>Cang Yan said as a hot aura spread out from his body and he threw out a punch.</p><p>His fist force was extremely hot, like a ball of lava, and it blasted toward the stone tower’s door.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Sword Dao Wuji, mo jiuye, and Lu Ming also attacked the stone tower’s door.</p><p>The stone tower looked very old, as if it would decay and collapse at any time. However, when their attacks landed on the stone tower’s door, the door only shook violently and didn’t explode.</p><p>“What are you guys doing? Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s gaze swept across the other geniuses from the unique demon Academy.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites ‘expressions changed. They then attacked together and attacked the stone tower’s door.</p><p>At the same time, the paragons of the indestructible sword sect, the boundless Holy Land, and Ouyang Xiangxiang all attacked. One attack after another bombarded the stone tower’s door.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The stone tower’s door kept shaking. After a while, a crack appeared on the door.</p><p>“Success, continue!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji’s eyes lit up, and he attacked even harder. Beams of dazzling sword Qi kept slashing at the door.</p><p>Kachaa! Kachaa!</p><p>More and more cracks appeared on the door. Not long after, there was a loud bang and the door exploded.</p><p>Behind the gate was a wide hall. Through the gate, one could clearly see an altar in the middle of the hall. Above the altar, three bronze array plates were floating.</p><p>Array plates, three array plates!</p><p>The eyes of Lu Ming and the group lit up, emitting a burning glow.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming, sword Dao infinitum, cangyan po Jun, and Mo jiuye moved at the same time and rushed into the hall.</p><p>The hall was very spacious and there was nothing else except for the altar and the three array plates.</p><p>“The array plate is mine!”</p><p>Mo jiuye formed a huge hand and grabbed at the three array plates.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
