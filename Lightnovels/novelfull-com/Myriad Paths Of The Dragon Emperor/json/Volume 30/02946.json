Not bad, not bad at all!”</p><p>The eyes of the general Demon city’s City Master lit up. Then, after exchanging a blow with Lu Ming, he quickly retreated.</p><p>“Wait a minute, stop fighting!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord roared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Initially, he wanted to activate the battle formula to quadruple his combat strength and finish off his opponent. However, his opponent suddenly stopped fighting. Lu Ming was slightly stunned and stopped attacking.</p><p>“Little brother, with your strength, you must be a peerless heaven’s favorite from the outside world. I believe you wouldn’t kill someone for no reason. What happened just now?”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord asked.</p><p>“They really bully the weak and fear the strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed in his heart. He thought that the other party was bullying the weak and afraid of the strong. After seeing his ability, he was afraid.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not want to fight to the end with the other party. He did not want to blow up the matter.</p><p>The purpose of his visit to Magic City mountain was to investigate the dark ice Race and the case of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s treasure being stolen. If the matter was blown up too much, it would be disadvantageous for his investigation.</p><p>“What’s going on? Hehe, your people are really overbearing …”</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained what had happened earlier.</p><p>After hearing this, the general Devil city’s city Lord’s face showed anger and he shouted coldly, ” so that’s how it is. He actually captured people without asking for the right and wrong. He really deserves to die!</p><p>Then, he looked at the other fiend generals and said, ” “Just like what I told you, you need evidence for everything, understand? Today, those who have fallen will be your lesson!”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Many general fiend guards nodded their heads, but they felt strange in their hearts. The city Lord usually didn’t give such orders. Of course, they didn’t dare to question the city Lord’s words.</p><p>“Little brother, it seems that this is a misunderstanding. I was too impetuous before. I attacked you without asking for the reason. I’m really sorry. Fortunately, little brother is strong. Otherwise, I’d have committed a sin!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. How could he not see through the city Lord’s pretense?</p><p>“Then how should we resolve this matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Write off everything, naturally write off everything!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>I’m Yan Zhi, the young city Lord of general Devil City. How should I address you? ”</p><p>At this moment, Yan Zhifei came over and greeted Lu Ming with a fist salute.</p><p>As the saying went, one should not slap a smiling face. Lu Ming smiled faintly and said, ” “Lu Ming!”</p><p>so it’s brother Lu. Lu Ming should be from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, right? only the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion can produce a prodigy like brother Lu!</p><p>Yan Zhi said courteously.</p><p>“Almost!”</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not deliberately deny it.</p><p>brother Lu is indeed the pride of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. I love to make friends with people like brother Lu. It’s really my good fortune to meet you today. Brother Lu, do you mind going for a drink? ”</p><p>Yan Zhi said.</p><p>“Of course you can!”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea in his mind and he nodded in agreement.</p><p>As the castellan of one of the 36 cities on Magic City mountain, the other party had a lot of power on Magic City mountain. Perhaps, he could be of help to Lu Ming’s investigation of the dark ice Race.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming had to integrate himself into Magic City mountain in order to better investigate.</p><p>For this, he would need the other party’s help. Moreover, Lu Ming was bold and skilled. He was not afraid that the other party would play any tricks.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord waved his hand.</p><p>Not long after, a banquet was prepared in the main hall of the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, Wu Zifeng, and Yue Linglong were all present. The city Lord of the demon City and Yan Zhi were also present.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’ve come to Magic City mountain for the great battle of Magic City, right?”</p><p>After drinking two glasses, Yan Zhi’s eyes turned and he asked with a smile.</p><p>“The great battle of demonic city?”</p><p>Lu Ming, Wu Zifeng, and the others looked puzzled.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you guys don’t know about the great battle in Shanghai?”</p><p>Yan Zhi was a little surprised.</p><p>I don’t know. This is the first time I’ve heard of it!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head.</p><p>“It’s not for the great battle in demonic city? So brother Lu, you’re here for mo yequan?”</p><p>Yan Zhi guessed again.</p><p>that’s right. It’s indeed for the sake of the demon night spring!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred. This time, he did not deny it.</p><p>it’s not easy to get the demon night spring. You have to go to the Magic City to have a chance to buy it. Brother Lu, do you have any way to get into the Magic City? ”</p><p>Yan Zhi asked tentatively.</p><p>“I don’t have a way yet. I wonder if brother Yan has a way to help me get into Shanghai?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>The joy in Yan Zhi’s eyes disappeared as he said, ” “There is a way. However, the number of people that we can recommend to enter the demon capital is very limited …”</p><p>At this point, Yan Zhi stopped.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. From Yan Zhi’s tone, Lu Ming could tell that the other party was going to state conditions.</p><p>“Brother Yan, if you have something to say, just say it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s good. I have something that I would like to ask brother Lu for help. If brother Lu can help me, I will think of a way to let the four of you enter the Magic City. It might even be possible to get the magic Night spring.</p><p>Yan Zhi said.</p><p>“Please speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>soon, there will be a battle between our general Devil City and the nearby ape Devil City. The younger generation will fight for a spiritual land. Each side will send three people. The spiritual land will belong to the side that wins. I would like to ask brother Lu to fight in the place of general Devil City!</p><p>Yan Zhi finally revealed his purpose.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He had long known that Yan Zhi had a condition. Otherwise, he would not have let him off so easily after killing so many people in general Demon City.</p><p>“Alright, I agree. When?”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded directly.</p><p>It was just a duel between the younger generation on Magic City mountain. Lu Ming did not take it to heart at all. To him, it was not difficult. It was as easy as lifting a finger.</p><p>it’ll be tomorrow. I’ll thank brother Lu in advance!</p><p>Yan Zhi raised his cup.</p><p>The city Lord of the general Devil City sat at the side, slowly drinking his wine, and did not speak.</p><p>After three rounds of drinking, the banquet finally ended. Lu Ming and the other three stayed in general Demon City for the time being.</p><p>On the second day!</p><p>“Little brother Lu Ming, to avoid alerting the enemy and making them suspicious, it’s not good for your friends to follow us. How about they stay in general Demon City for the time being?”</p><p>The general Devil City Lord said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>It was just a few rounds of competition, and it would end very soon. There was no harm in letting Qiu Yue and the others stay here for now.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming, Yan Zhi, and another young man from general Demon City left general Demon City together and headed to ape Demon City.</p><p>Ape Demon City was also one of the 36 satellite cities of demon Capital Mountain.</p><p>Magic City mountain. Magic City was high above and ruled Magic City mountain.</p><p>As for the thirty-six satellite cities under him, they were fighting on their own. Demonic city turned a blind eye to this.</p><p>The battle between the general Devil City and ape Devil City was particularly fierce.</p><p>In recent years, the two sides had been fighting for a spiritual land, a spiritual liquid Lake, and there would be a huge battle from time to time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
