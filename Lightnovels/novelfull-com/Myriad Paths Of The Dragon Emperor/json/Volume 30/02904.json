He did not retreat at all. He instantly activated the fourfold combat power of the battle character formula and executed the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes. He struck down with his spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The crescent-shaped spearlight struck mo jiuye’s huge black Hand. A terrifying collision occurred between the two and the force spread in all directions.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The crescent-shaped spear radiance shook continuously and finally exploded. Lu Ming’s body swayed and he retreated six to seven steps. However, mo jiuye’s condensed claw was also split in half.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s eyes narrowed in surprise. He did not expect Lu Ming to be able to block his move.</p><p>Even though he had just casually used that move, its power was still shocking. Lu Ming had not even used his ancient God Body, and he had managed to block the move. This made him look serious.</p><p>On the side, sword Dao Wu Ji and cangyan po Jun’s expressions also changed.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“So you’ve already broken through to the heavenly God Realm. But do you think that you can fight me just because you’ve broken through? I’ll let you know the difference between us!”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s eyes were cold as more black light emanated from his body, turning the area within 10000 meters of him into night.</p><p>It was pure Night, a night without any light.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! mo jiuye shouted coldly. In a flash, he charged towards Lu Ming like a ghost. The darkness around him spread rapidly and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Once Lu Ming was enveloped, he felt as if he had entered a bottomless abyss. His surroundings were silent. There was no sound or light.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, there was a violent tearing sound in the air from all directions. Pairs of pitch-black sharp claws suddenly appeared and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>These sharp claws were like pairs of ghost claws, emitting a disgusting smell.</p><p>“Break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s divine power surged and he used the sky-piercing move. The Spear’s gleam was like a meteor, piercing towards the sharp claws and crushing them.</p><p>However, as soon as the sharp claws were destroyed, they would immediately condense again and grab Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Nine ice chains flew out of his body. Each of them was tens of thousands of meters long. They wrapped around the claws and bound them.</p><p>The power of the ice shackles had increased with Lu Ming’s breakthrough to the celestial God Realm. It had become extremely shocking. The terrifying chill sealed all the ghost claws in ice before they exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re quite capable. However, let’s see how long you can last in my eternal night cage. Nine-armed Demon King, come out!</p><p>Mo jiuye’s voice rang out in the dark night.</p><p>Following that, a series of roars were heard. Then, three huge creatures appeared in the dark night.</p><p>The three huge creatures were covered in scales. They had wide mouths and fangs, and they actually had nine arms. They looked like demons that had walked out of the abyss.</p><p>This was the nine-armed Demon King that mo jiuye had mentioned.</p><p>Each of the nine-armed Demon King’s Arms held a weapon. It roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization art. Three nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced out. At the same time, he brandished his spear and charged forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The three-headed nine-armed Demon King brandished its nine weapons and slashed continuously. The three nine-clawed divine Dragons were the first to bear the brunt of the attack, and they were forced to retreat continuously, with holes appearing on their bodies.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s attack had arrived. The long spear and nine-armed Demon King’s weapon collided.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>There was a terrifying explosion, but Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could feel that the nine-armed Demon King’s power was shockingly strong. He could not withstand it at all. His body shook violently and he retreated continuously, almost spurting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The three nine-armed demon kings charged at Lu Ming from three different directions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, show me your ancient God Body. Let me see how strong you are!”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s voice sounded again.</p><p>“Since you want to see it, I’ll grant your wish!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said. He used the ancient God tactic. His body collided with the green-armored ancient God, and he became a green-armored ancient God hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>Once he turned into a green-armored ancient God, Lu Ming’s strength skyrocketed. He brandished his spear, shooting out rays of spear light at the three-headed nine-armed Demon King.</p><p>The nine-armed Demon King also brandished his weapon and attacked. However, in this collision, the nine-armed Demon King was completely outmatched and was forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at one of the nine-armed demon kings and charged at it. His attacks were like a storm, attacking the nine-armed Demon King.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine-armed Demon King barely managed to block a few moves before Lu Ming’s long spear struck its head. The nine-armed Demon King’s Head exploded, followed by its entire body.</p><p>After defeating one of the nine-armed demon kings, Lu Ming went after the other two.</p><p>Not long after, the remaining two nine-armed demon kings were defeated.</p><p>you have some strength. Also, in my eternal night cage, I am the master. Haha!</p><p>Mo jiuye laughed out loud. The dark night rolled and another nine-armed Demon King walked out.</p><p>This time, there were Nine Nine Nine-armed demon kings, roaring and charging at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming, who had transformed into a green-armored ancient God, was extremely powerful. After fighting with the nine-headed and nine-armed Demon King, he defeated it.</p><p>“I’ll break your eternal night cage!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and the long spear in his hand enlarged rapidly. A shocking spear radiance soared into the sky as if it could pierce through the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The area that mo jiuye’s eternal night cage could cover was limited. The spear radiance pierced through the air and created a hole in the dark night, allowing the light from the outside to enter.</p><p>Under the light, mo jiuye’s eternal night cage was like ice and snow meeting fire. It melted and disappeared.</p><p>As the night disappeared, Lu Ming and Mo jiuye’s figures were revealed.</p><p>“This is … The green-armored ancient God Body! Lu Ming has actually cultivated the green-armored ancient God Body!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s current state, sword Dao limitless and grayflame Army breaker were shocked.</p><p>he even managed to break mo jiuye’s eternal night cage. His strength is truly shocking.</p><p>he’s only a first level celestial deity. How can he possibly have such powerful battle strength? ”</p><p>Sword Dao infinitum and ashen flames break Army spoke one after another with grave expressions. In their hearts, they had already regarded Lu Ming as an opponent of the same level.</p><p>They were old rivals with mo jiuye, so they naturally knew how terrifying his secret skill was. Even for them, it was extremely difficult to break out of it.</p><p>As for the other geniuses of the three Overlord forces, they were completely stunned.</p><p>Mo jiuye, the divine Son of the Yimo Academy, stood at the peak of the younger generation in the qintian Galaxy. There was almost no one who could be his opponent. There were only a few people in the entire qintian Galaxy who could be his opponent.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually able to fight against mo jiuye. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>“Mo jiuye, is this your full strength? I heard you’ve also cultivated an ancient God Body. Show me, or you won’t be my match!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
