If you have the ability, then let him out!</p><p>The Golden-robed youth shouted coldly.</p><p>“This brat, it’s this brat …”</p><p>All of a sudden, a young man on the fighting ring roared and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Yes, he was staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>The young man had a scale between his brows. He was one of the six young men who had gone to the Kong Xuan sect with Qin Wushang.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had seen this young man the moment he arrived. However, Lu Ming had no intention of avoiding him.</p><p>He came here to find an opportunity to fight, why would he need to avoid it?</p><p>“What?”</p><p>All of a sudden, the young men on the fighting ring turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is the guy who defeated you? And you even humiliated Qin Wushang?”</p><p>The other young man coldly spoke, his gaze icy.</p><p>This young man also had a silver-white scale on his forehead. Under the sunlight, it shimmered.</p><p>It was obvious that this young man was also from the Qin clan.</p><p>This person was called Qin wuyou!</p><p>that’s right. It’s him. This is the guy!</p><p>The young man who had been to Kong Xuan sect roared.</p><p>“Good, very good!”</p><p>Qin wuyou’s indifferent voice rang out as a cold killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He suddenly stood up from his seat, and a violent aura filled the air.</p><p>divine-grade divine power. This is divine-grade divine power. What a terrifying aura!</p><p>heavens, this is a Divine Son level character!</p><p>Many people around the fighting ring shouted.</p><p>Divine Son level figures could be counted on one’s fingers in the Qin heaven Starfield. Each one of them was a peerless genius, an existence whose name shook the vast starry sky.</p><p>Now, any one of the other party’s people who stood up was such a figure. It was truly shocking.</p><p>you dare to humiliate my Qin family’s disciple. Although he’s a piece of trash, it’s not your place to humiliate him. Now, get up here and accept your death!</p><p>Qin wuyou’s cold voice rang out as he looked at Lu Ming with an even colder gaze.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>Many people in the Qin heaven Star Zone did not know Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, the news of the battle in the Galaxy for the star core had only spread within a small range. Most people did not know that Lu Ming had fought the divine Son of the unique devil Academy, mo jiuye, and even suppressed him.</p><p>I know him. He’s a Saint of the Kong Xuan sect. I heard he’s very talented!</p><p>“The Saint of Kong Xuan sect? The gap between us is too big. He probably doesn’t dare to accept the challenge, right?”</p><p>that’s for sure. The other party is the Son of God. Wouldn’t he be courting death if he went up? ”</p><p>Many people around the fighting ring were discussing.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>“Qin wuyou of the Qin family!”</p><p>Qin wuyou asked.</p><p>“I’m sorry, you misunderstood me. I mean, Who Do You Think You Are? you want me to fight and I want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Qin wuyou’s face instantly darkened, and his killing intent became several times colder.</p><p>“Your ears aren’t good either?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>In the surroundings, the hearts of many people from the Qin heaven Star Zone were beating wildly. They were all impressed by Lu Ming’s courage.</p><p>Some people were still thinking that although Lu Ming did not dare to go up and fight, he was really bold to speak to the other party like that.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Qin wuyou’s voice became extremely cold. As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed down like an angry lion, pouncing on his prey.</p><p>“Sixth level heavenly deity!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>The moment the other party made his move, he had already seen through the other party’s cultivation.</p><p>A sixth level celestial deity with divine-grade divine power. This person was likely to be on the same level as mo jiuye. His combat strength was far above Qin Wushang’s.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the divine power in his body and was about to attack.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll fight you!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a voice was heard not far from Lu Ming and the others. Then, a burly figure burst out, and a scorching aura filled the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two figures met in mid-air and collided fiercely.</p><p>It was like two meteors had collided, creating shockwaves that spread in all directions. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Then, the two figures trembled and floated backward.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The one who had rushed out to exchange blows with Qin wuyou was the boundless sacred land’s Divine Son, cangyan po Jun.</p><p>it’s cangyan pojun! He’s making his move!</p><p>the Divine Child level character has arrived. Haha, this is going to be interesting!</p><p>Lu Ming is so lucky. Otherwise, he would have been in danger just now!</p><p>Many people were overjoyed to see cangyan po Jun attack.</p><p>Cangyan pojun, as the peak figure of the younger generation in the Qin heaven Starfield, his combat strength far exceeded the other geniuses. With him, they could finally fight against the geniuses of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor and not be suppressed so badly.</p><p>interesting. I didn’t expect that the Qin heaven Starfield would still have a decent opponent!</p><p>Qin wuyou glared at cangyan pojun, revealing a strong battle intent.</p><p>cut the crap and make your move. I want to see how strong the Paragon of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is!</p><p>Cangyan pojun shouted coldly as the heat from his body grew stronger and stronger. His battle intent was even stronger than his opponent.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Cangyan pojun’s figure moved and rushed up the fighting stage, his meaning was self-evident.</p><p>“If you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Qin wuyou said ferociously. With a flash of his body, he also rushed into the fighting ring.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Without any unnecessary words, cangyan pojun and Qin wuyou started fighting.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>Qin wuyou’s entire body glowed as he used the seven injury divine fist.</p><p>Two terrifying fist prints burst out and crushed towards cangyan pojun.</p><p>It was the same seven injury divine fist technique, but Qin wuyou’s was much more powerful than Qin Wushang’s.</p><p>“Ashen flame explosive fist!”</p><p>Grayflame breaking Army also used fist techniques, but his fist techniques were different. They were direct and overbearing, and each punch was like a star exploding with endless power.</p><p>The two of them clashed head-on and fought intensely. The huge fighting ring was filled with their fist forces.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves, but there was no clear winner.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the end, with a loud boom, the two of them retreated and stood on both sides of the fighting ring.</p><p>interesting. I didn’t expect that there would be a decent opponent in the Qin heaven Starfield. However, only one is far from enough. Are there any other decent experts? come out together!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the Golden-robed young man stood up and said lazily, his eyes sweeping around.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the sound of a sword could be heard from not far away. Then, a ray of sword light appeared in the sky above the fighting ring.</p><p>This young man was handsome. He was the divine Son of the indestructible sword sect, the boundless sword Dao.</p><p>As soon as boundless sword Dao appeared, a demonic light flashed from another direction. A black-robed young man appeared in the sky above the fighting stage. He was the divine Son of the unique demon Academy, mo jiuye.</p><p>The divine sons of the three Overlord forces had gathered.</p><p>“Interesting. Anything else?”</p><p>The gold-robed youth asked.</p><p>“Since you want to meet him, then let’s meet him!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice rang out. In the sky, a cold aura filled the air as a white-robed young man strolled over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
