They had obviously recognized him.</p><p>However, they only took a casual glance and went back to their cultivation.</p><p>“Not enough, not enough, continue …”</p><p>Lu Ming kept walking forward, getting closer to the statue.</p><p>Very quickly, Lu Ming was a hundred miles away from the statue. At this point, the pressure from the statue was shockingly strong. Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly, and he felt that it was difficult to circulate the divine energy in his body.</p><p>“Alright, this is the place!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and began to circulate the universe thousand Dao Scripture to Polish his Foundation.</p><p>This cultivation took half a year.</p><p>In the beginning, it was extremely difficult to circulate divine energy. He could only complete one cycle after a few days. Now, Lu Ming could already complete one cycle in an hour.</p><p>Compared to before, the level of comfort had increased by tens of times.</p><p>“This kind of pressure is really a good place to Polish one’s Foundation!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming ended his cultivation.</p><p>In just half a year’s time, Lu Ming felt that his Foundation had become extremely solid. If he was outside, it would be very difficult to achieve this without a few hundred years.</p><p>you’ve saved me a lot of time, but I’ve spent half a year here. It’s time to leave!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>‘I wonder how star-moon ancient city is doing in half a year.’</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and retreated, leaving the statue.</p><p>&Nbsp; when he was a thousand li away from the statue, the divine power in his body rumbled and began to move at an astonishing speed.</p><p>“It’s so pure and smooth …”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. After half a year of polishing, his Foundation was even more solid than before. There were no obstacles in the circulation of divine power. It was smooth and natural, very rich.</p><p>Now, as long as the other divine power in his body reached a state of being full, he could start to attempt to charge for fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>“This half a year has been worth it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and then rose into the air, planning to leave this place.</p><p>However, at this moment, a few streams of light shot up from the ground not far away. They came from different directions and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you’ve finally finished and come out!”</p><p>One of them sneered.</p><p>“The Qin clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>These young men were all from the Qin clan. The people of the Qin clan all had a scale between their eyebrows, which was easy to recognize.</p><p>It was obvious that the people from the Qin family had been waiting for Lu Ming to leave the area where the statue was. They were waiting for him to attack.</p><p>That was because Lu Ming was under immense pressure at the statue. It was not convenient for them to take action.</p><p>kid, we have wasted a few months for you. We want you to know that there is only one consequence for killing the people of the Qin clan …</p><p>A youth from the Qin clan exuded a powerful aura.</p><p>Half-step Divine King realm!</p><p>Furthermore, this person’s body faintly exuded a primitive and ancient aura. Although this person had not awakened the origin divine power factor, the degree of awakening was not low. His strength was definitely extremely shocking.</p><p>For the time being, Lu Ming was not a match for such a prodigy.</p><p>Moreover, the Qin clan had more than one heaven’s favorite of this level. There were two.</p><p>There were also two ninth-level celestial deity prodigies. A total of four people surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Qin wuyou, you’re just courting death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. At the same time, his eyes darted around, looking for a way to escape.</p><p>He definitely couldn’t force it. The other party’s strength was above his, and it would be foolish to force it.</p><p>Leaving was the best plan!</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? you’re just a piece of trash from the Qin heaven star system. If my Qin clan wants to kill you, we’ll kill you. You can only obediently wait to be killed. Do you understand?”</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s young men shouted coldly with an arrogant look.</p><p>Lu Ming only smiled faintly and could not be bothered to reply.</p><p>What’s there to say to this kind of person?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming let out a roar and threw out a series of punches. Seven nine-clawed divine Dragons flew out with a roar and pounced on a half-step Divine King expert of the Qin family.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>die! the young man from the Qin clan shouted coldly. His body shook and a violent divine power gushed out.</p><p>Then, he punched out, and a huge fist print rushed out, shaking the void.</p><p>Lu Ming’s seven nine-clawed divine Dragons crumbled one after another.</p><p>The man had a proud expression on his face. He was about to say something to show off when he saw Lu Ming’s actions and roared, ” “Be careful!”</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming did not continue to attack him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s attack on him was just an illusion.</p><p>After Lu Ming launched his attack, he retreated rapidly and rushed towards a ninth-level celestial deity youth from the Qin family. At the same time, his body expanded rapidly and he transformed into an ancient God Body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was to create a diversion and escape.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming shot out his spear at the ninth level heavenly deity Qin clan’s prodigy.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>The man reacted and threw a punch, sending a huge fist print at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, a ninth-level celestial deity who had not awakened the origin divine power factor was not Lu Ming’s match at all. The Spear’s gleam struck and the fist print shattered.</p><p>The Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert retreated and coughed out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure rushed past him. He then cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged forward.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Another half-step Divine King from the Qin family attacked as well when he saw Lu Ming’s attack. He threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to fly forward but he was too slow and the punch landed on his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire body trembled. He staggered and almost fell. On his back, green scales flew in the air. The fist print had blasted a big hole in his back, and blood was dripping from it.</p><p>“I’ll remember this!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed and continued to fly despite the pain.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The four Qin family elites chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, both parties disappeared from this place.</p><p>One was chasing while the other was fleeing. In the blink of an eye, they had already flown a distance of several hundred thousand miles. Those two ninth level heavenly deity Qin clan’s geniuses were already unable to keep up with the speed and had fallen behind.</p><p>However, the two half-step Divine King Qin family’s geniuses were slowly closing the distance between them and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. He had just taken a blow from a half-step Divine King Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert and was injured. He was not in his peak condition. Otherwise, he could have used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and escaped.</p><p>But now, his speed was slightly slower than his opponent.</p><p>“Brat, you can’t escape!”</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s young men shouted coldly, his killing intent cold.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word and continued flying.</p><p>Not long after, the distance between the two sides closed.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s geniuses made his move and threw a punch.</p><p>This heaven’s favorite of the Qin family had probably awakened sixty or even seventy percent of his divine power. With his half-step Divine King cultivation base, his attack was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>The space whistled and the terrifying fist force approached Lu Ming in an instant.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and struck out with his long spear. A crescent-shaped spear ray burst out and rushed toward the other party’s fist print.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
