Today, no one can save you!”</p><p>A cold voice resounded in the air above the Colosseum. Then, a silver light flashed and a middle-aged man in silver robes appeared in the air.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>When he saw the silver-robed middle-aged man, he was overjoyed.</p><p>This middle-aged man was one of the nine great demon masters of the demon capital, Wan Xing’s father, Wan er!</p><p>“Father, quick, kill this brat. No, I want this brat to suffer. fate worse than death …”</p><p>Wan Xing roared.</p><p>“Don’t worry. In my hands, he won’t die so easily even if he wants to. Attack and cripple his cultivation first!”</p><p>Ten thousand evil’s cold voice sounded.</p><p>“Demon master, leave this brat to me!”</p><p>A burly man in iron armor asked.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Evil nodded. This armored man had a cultivation base of ninth-level celestial deity. It was more than enough to deal with Lu Ming, who was only a third-level celestial deity.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The armored man took a step forward, and a violent aura broke out of his body, as thick as a mountain.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll break your right arm first!”</p><p>A long spear appeared in the armored man’s hand. It was extremely sharp.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the armored man rushed toward Lu Ming. He swung his spear at Lu Ming’s right hand.</p><p>Although he was burly, his speed was astonishing.</p><p>“Ninth level heavenly deity?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and directly activated the battle character formula, increasing his combat strength by four times.</p><p>The fourfold increase in combat strength was triggered. Lu Ming’s combat strength soared and he kept swinging his fists.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>The roars of the dragons resounded through the sky as the six nine-clawed divine Dragons pounced toward the armored man.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The iron-armored man shouted coldly. His spear vibrated and he instantly launched dozens of attacks at the six nine-clawed divine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The spear struck the nine-clawed Divine dragon’s claw and burst into a dazzling light. However, the result was not what the armored man had expected.</p><p>He initially thought he could defeat the nine-clawed Divine Dragon in an instant, but the truth was that his body was numbed by the impact and he almost fell back.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can this force be so powerful?”</p><p>The armored man was shocked.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, another Dragon’s Roar was heard.</p><p>It turned out that Lu Ming had pushed the divine Dragon phenomenon art to its limit and had made another breakthrough. He could now condense seven Divine Dragon images at once.</p><p>The seventh Divine Dragon image then pounced at the armored man. The armored man could not resist it and was pushed back.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Lu Ming cast the ice chain. The ninth and most powerful ice chain flew out and wrapped around the armored man. A layer of Ice Armor appeared on the armored man’s body with a shocking chill.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out, his palm like a knife, and with a slash, the armored man’s right hand was cut off.</p><p>The armored man wanted to cut off Lu Ming’s right hand. However, after exchanging a few moves, his right hand was cut off by Lu Ming.</p><p>At the scene, the others were so shocked that they couldn’t speak.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a third-level celestial deity, but he had defeated a ninth-level celestial deity in a few moves. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Wan Xing was so scared that his face turned pale.</p><p>All evil’s eyes were also filled with shock.</p><p>“Demon Lord, save me!”</p><p>At this moment, the armored man was terrified and shouted for help.</p><p>“If you want to cripple me, you must be prepared to be killed by me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He condensed a combat sword with divine power in his hand.</p><p>“Brat, you dare …”</p><p>Ten thousand evils shouted.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He swung his combat sword and killed the armored man.</p><p>A ninth level celestial deity existence was a peak expert in Magic City mountain, but he was killed just like that.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Ten thousand evil was furious, and a violent aura rushed out of his body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The body of all evil glowed with silver light as a terrifying pressure spread in all directions.</p><p>The aura of all evil was much stronger than that of the armored man.</p><p>This was the aura of a half-step Divine King. His divine power was strong and shocking.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to crush you! Silver claw hand!”</p><p>Evil bellowed and his entire body turned silver. His claws were like metal as he clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The force whistled. Before it reached Lu Ming, the force was so oppressive that he had difficulty breathing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also froze.</p><p>A half-step Divine King was indeed much stronger than a ninth level heavenly God.</p><p>“Ancient God tactic!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming used the ancient God tactic at full force and turned into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Transforming into a green-armored ancient God, Lu Ming thrust his spear forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The dazzling spear radiance and the evil silver claw collided with each other, creating a terrifying explosion.</p><p>At the same time, countless tiny spear radiances and Qi flew out in all directions.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>“Ah, let’s go!”</p><p>Countless people in the surrounding stands turned pale with fright and fled in all directions.</p><p>However, when the Qi landed, many people screamed as they were killed by the Qi.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The grandstand of the Colosseum was constantly rumbling, and a large pit was created. Cracks appeared on the ground.</p><p>Through these large pits and cracks, one could see that there was a huge underground space beneath the Colosseum. The ground had been completely excavated, forming a huge secret chamber that imprisoned countless desolate beasts and fiend slaves.</p><p>Countless spectators fled in all directions. Many of them flew up into the sky. It was a mess.</p><p>In the sky, Lu Ming and all evil were still in a stalemate.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few more moves.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming gained the upper hand and defeated all evil’s Silver claw in one fell swoop. All evil’s body shook violently and was sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase. He twisted his body and rushed underground instead.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear swept out and hit the ground. The ground burst out with a terrifying roar and collapsed continuously. The vast underground space was completely exposed.</p><p>Some of the secret rooms crumbled, and some wild beasts rushed out.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Many desolate beasts, with huge bodies, howled towards the sky and charged out of the shackles, charging into the sky.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>All evil roared. More than five hundred Demon City guards set up a great formation in the sky.</p><p>The formation activated, and countless beams of divine light shot toward the wild beasts. Many of the wild beasts were pierced by the divine light and died on the spot.</p><p>“Brother Wu, where are Qiu Yue and the others? take me there!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Wu Zifeng.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Wu Zifeng shouted and rushed toward a crack in the ground. Lu Ming followed closely behind and flew into the underground space.</p><p>Originally, the underground space of the Colosseum had been guarded by many Magic City guards. However, now that the Magic City guards had all gone out, there was no obstruction in the underground space.</p><p>The underground space was huge and divided into seven levels.</p><p>According to Wu Zifeng, they were locked up on the fifth floor.</p><p>The two of them headed straight for the fifth level. However, wherever Lu Ming passed by, he would make a move and blast open the secret chambers to release the desolate beasts and demonic slaves inside.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
