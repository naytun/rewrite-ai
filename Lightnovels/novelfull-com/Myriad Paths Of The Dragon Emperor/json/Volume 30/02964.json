However, a powerful aura also burst out from the city master’s mansion.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Figures rushed out one after another, forcing Wu Xue and the others to retreat.</p><p>“Devil Lord!”</p><p>Wu Xue’s eyes focused on the figure in front of him.</p><p>Including the Apeman from before, there were a total of six figures. Their auras were extremely thick, and their divine power erupted like a volcano.</p><p>All six of them were half-step divine kings, the other six of the nine great Devil Kings.</p><p>In addition to the three great demon kings of the Colosseum, the nine great demon kings of the demon capital were all present.</p><p>“As expected, you foreign heaven’s favorites don’t have good intentions in coming to Shanghai!”</p><p>One of the demon masters said coldly.</p><p>“It’s too late to know now!”</p><p>Wu Xue said gloomily.</p><p>“Too late? Hehe, you want to act so atrociously in Shanghai? today, all of you shall stay here!”</p><p>One of the demon masters said coldly, his voice filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a group of people rushed out of the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>All of them were Magic City guards in iron armor, and there were nearly five thousand of them.</p><p>It was said that there were 8000 Magic City guards in Magic City, and almost all of them, except for the Colosseum, were present.</p><p>The combined aura of the six great Devil Kings and nearly 5000 demonic city guards was truly terrifying. Like the ocean waves, they surged towards Wu Xue and the others one after another, forcing them to retreat.</p><p>It was obvious that the city Lord’s mansion of Shanghai had already made preparations.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, very good!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice suddenly rang out in the void. Then, a sword-light suddenly descended from the sky and charged towards the group of Shanghai guards.</p><p>This sword light was astonishingly fast, and it disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>One of the demon masters shouted.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere as the sword light flashed. At least a hundred demonic city guards were killed. Their bodies were cut in half, and their souls were obliterated by the terrifying sword Qi.</p><p>In the next moment, a black-robed young man appeared in the sky, standing with a sword in his hand.</p><p>“This is … Ninth level celestial deity realm!”</p><p>A demon master cried out in alarm, his expression grave.</p><p>Clearly, the black-robed youth was not an ordinary ninth level celestial deity, but a ninth level celestial deity who controlled divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Back then, during the great battle in demonic city, such a character did not appear at all.</p><p>“Hahaha, the Demon King token, I want it!”</p><p>At this time, a loud laugh came from a building not far away. Then, a golden light flashed, and a burly figure appeared in the sky. His entire body was covered in golden divine light.</p><p>This was also a young man whose cultivation had reached the ninth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>“The Demon King’s token is mine!”</p><p>A deep voice sounded. Another young man came from another direction.</p><p>The aura that this person emitted was shockingly also ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>The six demon kings ‘faces turned ugly.</p><p>They didn’t expect so many terrifying heaven’s favorites to enter demonic city. During the demonic City War, these heaven’s favorites didn’t appear. This caused them to underestimate the strength of the heaven’s favorites from outside.</p><p>However, Wu Xue and the others looked very calm.</p><p>It was obvious that they had known about the existence of these heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Pei Lin and the Apeman were still fighting, but Pei Lin was gradually losing.</p><p>“Do it, or else things will change!”</p><p>The young man who was covered in golden light said. As soon as he finished speaking, his figure turned into a golden light and charged towards the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>“Set up the formation!”</p><p>A Demon King roared, summoning the demon capital guards to set up a large formation.</p><p>However, at this moment, a black fog suddenly appeared in the sky above the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>The fog instantly enveloped the 5000 demonic city guards and the six demon kings.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Some of the Shanghai guards held onto their heads and screamed in pain. After a while, some of the Shanghai guards fell to the ground and stopped breathing.</p><p>Even those with higher cultivation had pained expressions on their faces.</p><p>“This mist can harm the soul. Leave this place!”</p><p>One of the demon masters roared as he charged out, wanting to leave this place.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. The black-robed young man with a long sword in his hand charged toward the demon master.</p><p>The demon master bellowed and launched an attack to block it. However, after a flash of sword-light, the demon master retreated. A deep wound appeared on his body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>The demon master’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Although he was a half-step Divine King, he was no match for the black-robed young man, especially when he was surrounded by the mist and his soul was injured.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The black-robed youth coldly snorted as he continued to attack. He seemed to be unafraid of the mist.</p><p>senior brother has made his move. Kill, kill!</p><p>Wu Xue’s face lit up with joy as she charged over as well.</p><p>At the same time, the other young men also made their moves and charged at the Shanghai guards.</p><p>These young men were clearly well prepared. They weren’t afraid of the mist and could maintain their combat strength at their peak. As for the demonic city guards, their souls had been injured by the mist and their strength had been greatly reduced. They weren’t a match at all.</p><p>As soon as the two sides exchanged blows, a large number of Shanghai guards were killed. In less than a minute, over a thousand Shanghai guards had fallen.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>An angry roar came from the ape demon master.</p><p>At that moment, a bloodied young man appeared behind the ape demon master. His claws pierced through the ape demon master’s heart, and with a squeeze, a terrifying power erupted from the ape demon master’s body.</p><p>The ape demon master screamed as he was killed.</p><p>“Senior brother!”</p><p>The witch’s blood and the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm were overjoyed to see the blood-soaked young man.</p><p>This blood-soaked youth was also a ninth level celestial deity. The mist earlier was released by him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The blood-soaked youth charged at another demon master.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Not long after, another demon master was killed by the young man who was covered in golden light.</p><p>In an instant, only four of the six great demon kings remained.</p><p>At this moment, the mist was everywhere. The demonic city guards were at a complete disadvantage. People were being killed at every moment.</p><p>“Quick, send a message to the Infernal King!”</p><p>“Call the Demon King out!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” kill!   the demon masters shouted and transmitted messages to the night Demon King.</p><p>With their current strength, they were no longer able to stop the foreign heaven’s pride experts. If this continued, they would all die.</p><p>However, there was no news after they sent the message. The night Demon King did not appear.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>A few demon masters shouted.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>The blood bubble young man sneered.</p><p>Now, there were only four demon masters left.</p><p>As for the foreign prodigies, there were also four ninth-level heavenly deities, one for each of them.</p><p>Originally, these demon masters ‘strength was inferior to these ninth-level heavenly deity divine sons of heaven’s pride. In addition, they were affected by the fog and became even weaker. They were simply not a match for them.</p><p>“Even if I die, I won’t let you have an easy time!”</p><p>“Let’s die together!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the remaining four demon kings were all going all-out, burning their divine power and fighting with the four prodigies.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
