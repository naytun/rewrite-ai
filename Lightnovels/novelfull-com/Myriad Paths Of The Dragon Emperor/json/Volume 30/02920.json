Lu Ming did not know how many pieces there were. They were enough for him to use for a long time.</p><p>There were also all sorts of divine pills with different functions, all of which were of excellent quality.</p><p>In addition, all kinds of blacksmithing materials and metal attribute materials were also piled up like mountains.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was full of smiles. After QiuQiu woke up, he would not have to worry about his food for a long time.</p><p>In addition, there were also divine artifacts of various grades.</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought and a Crimson spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power and waved it. A terrifying roar was heard in the air.</p><p>“Good spear!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>This was a level nine high-quality divine artifact. It was most suitable for Lu Ming’s current use.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately refined the divine weapon. After refining it, the spear flew into Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. It would be very convenient to use it in the future.</p><p>In addition, Dragon Boat Mountain had also collected many divine skill manuals, cultivation technique manuals, secret skill manuals, and so on.</p><p>Lu Ming sorted through the contents. What made him the happiest was that there were two divine grade techniques in the pile.</p><p>These two divine techniques were not the ones that Kong Xuan sect had collected. Lu Ming had never seen them before. Clearly, they were the private goods of Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>Now that he had the star core, he wanted to cultivate a few more kinds of Shen power. There were ready-made Shen techniques that came to him.</p><p>As long as he cultivated these two divine techniques, his divine power would be even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the two divine grade techniques and took out some storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained these storage rings from the geniuses of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect.</p><p>Lu Ming sorted out the storage rings.</p><p>What made Lu Ming ecstatic was that he had obtained two more divine techniques.</p><p>One of them was the multi-eyed divine technique that he had obtained from the four-eyed heavenly court of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>At the peak of cultivation, one could cultivate multi-eyed divine power. The divine power controlled by the four-eyed void court was this divine grade divine power.</p><p>What excited Lu Ming the most was the other one. He got it from Zhuo bumu, the unparalleled genius of the indestructible sword sect. It was called the indestructible sword technique.</p><p>This divine technique was the most important technique of the indestructible sword sect. However, there were very few people who could cultivate it to its peak. This was because once cultivated to its peak, one could cultivate a divine-grade divine power, the indestructible sword force.</p><p>For example, the divine Son of the indestructible sword sect had cultivated this divine technique to the extreme and cultivated it into divine-grade divine power. It was indestructible and its offensive power was shocking.</p><p>As for Zhuo Buzhu, he had only cultivated a sacred grade divine power and was far from cultivating a divine grade divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was thumping.</p><p>He had the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture. He did not need to cultivate to the peak. It was enough to cultivate a wisp of Shen power.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming decided to spend the rest of his time cultivating these four divine techniques. As for those King-grade divine techniques, Lu Ming was not interested in them at all.</p><p>This was because it was very difficult to condense a star core with King-grade divine power. When Lu Ming entered the divine King realm, the king-grade divine power would not be of much use.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to find an opportunity in the future to merge the three types of King grade divine energy in his body with the divine grade divine energy or divine grade divine energy that had similar attributes.</p><p>“I’ll cultivate the divine-grade wondrous technique, the indestructible sword technique, first.”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then took out the ‘indestructible sword technique’ to read and comprehend it in detail.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating a divine-grade divine technique was naturally incomparable to that of a divine-grade divine technique. Lu Ming spent a full year before he successfully cultivated the first stage.</p><p>After cultivating the first stage, Lu Ming had condensed a wisp of inextinguishable sword force. To Lu Ming, that was enough.</p><p>After cultivating the first level, Lu Ming put down the indestructible sword technique and went on to study another Holy-grade divine technique, the multi-eyed divine technique.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming spent a few years to cultivate the four divine techniques to the first level and cultivated a wisp of divine power.</p><p>This was only the beginning of his cultivation. Following that, Lu Ming focused on circulating the universe thousand Dao mantra to strengthen the four types of divine powers.</p><p>It would take a long time to cultivate these four Shen powers to the same level as the other Shen powers.</p><p>Next, Lu Ming entered a deep level of seclusion.</p><p>And after the Qin heaven Starfield went through a period of turmoil, it also fell into peace.</p><p>Time passed quickly. Two hundred years had passed.</p><p>To the Qin heaven Starfield, 200 years was just a blink of an eye.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was a great harvest.</p><p>After two hundred years, Lu Ming had finally cultivated three of the divine grade divine powers to the point where they were as strong and condensed as the other divine powers. Only the inextinguishable sword force was more difficult to cultivate as it was a divine grade divine power. He had not cultivated it to the point where it was as strong as the other divine powers, but the difference was not too big.</p><p>He should be able to catch up in a few decades.</p><p>In this way, there were ten divine power flowers in Lu Ming’s dantian. They were extremely dazzling, like ten stars in the starry sky.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were two divine-grade divine powers, five sacred-grade divine powers, and three king-grade divine powers.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current cultivation level was still at the first-tier celestial deity realm, his divine power was much stronger than it was two hundred years ago. His combat strength had also improved by a large margin.</p><p>Moreover, in the past two hundred years, he had not been completely cultivating the universe thousand Dao Scripture. He had taken time to study the divine Dragon materialization technique, various divine skills, and the battle character formula.</p><p>He had improved quite a bit in all aspects.</p><p>In terms of magical skills, Lu Ming had successfully cultivated the third move of the three apocalyptic strikes, star explosion!</p><p>This move was known as the supernova, and one could imagine how powerful it was.</p><p>In addition, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and the nine layers of Crimson Gold armor had all reached the seventh layer.</p><p>He had reached the seventh level of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, which was the peak.</p><p>However, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique was an incomplete speed-type divine skill. There must be other higher levels. Lu Ming planned to spend some time to look for them.</p><p>There was also the battle character. Lu Ming had finally cultivated the quadruple combat strength to its peak and achieved a 100% success rate.</p><p>Lu Ming had already started to comprehend the fivefold increase in combat strength. However, it was too difficult. After many years of cultivation, Lu Ming still had no idea.</p><p>In short, after two hundred years, although Lu Ming’s cultivation level did not increase, his combat strength had improved by a large margin.</p><p>If Lu Ming continued to face mo jiuye, the divine Son of the unique devil Academy, he was confident that he could suppress him.</p><p>At this moment, a figure with a curly beard floated over from outside the mountain.</p><p>“Qiuyue!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up with a smile and walked up to her. He held Qiu Yue’s hand and sized her up. Then, his eyes lit up and he said in surprise, ” “Qiuyue, you broke through to the heavenly God Realm!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
