In an instant, it sliced through the air and headed towards Leng Ying’s chest.</p><p>However, in the face of Xue Dong’s terrifying attack, Leng Ying’s expression was still relaxed.</p><p>He stretched out a hand and clawed out.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The sharp sound of air being cut rang out. Leng Ying’s claw had completely transformed into a Divine eagle’s claw and grabbed Xue Dong’s combat sword.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, the divine Eagle cried out, and the sword light trembled continuously. In the next moment, Xue Dong’s sword light actually shattered, and a figure retreated rapidly, retreating hundreds of meters before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>The person who retreated was Xue Dong, while Leng Ying’s figure remained unmoving.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>How did this happen?</p><p>Xue Dong and Leng Ying were both ninth level heavenly deities, and Xue Dong was a sword cultivator who specialized in attacks. Yet, he was actually forced back by Leng Ying in a head-on collision. What was going on?</p><p>Xue Dong’s eyes also became serious. The aura on his body became stronger. Sword will filled the sky and countless tiny sword Qi wandered around him.</p><p>“Lonestar sword of destruction!”</p><p>Xue Dong let out a low growl. He struck out with his sword again, sending out countless sword Qi. But the next moment, the countless sword Qi gathered together and turned into a sword light as thick as a mountain, slashing towards Leng Ying.</p><p>“Did you use your ultimate move? This move is more decent!”</p><p>Leng Ying’s cold voice rang out. Then, his figure soared into the sky. He circulated his divine power and seemed to have completely transformed into a Divine Eagle. His wings were like blades as he flapped them.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The violent energy collided with each other, creating thousands of energy waves.</p><p>In an instant, there were hundreds of explosions.</p><p>In the end, the sword light trembled and shattered in the air. Then, a Divine Eagle flashed and disappeared. Following that, a figure cried out in pain and retreated.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xue Dong’s body crashed heavily onto the mountain peak and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>His chest had been torn open, and there were a few bloody holes. They were clearly caused by the Eagle’s claws.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The ninth level celestial deity sword Xiu Xue Dong had only exchanged two moves and was already defeated.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Many of the new members ‘faces were pale and they couldn’t believe it.</p><p>They were at the same level, and they both had divine-grade divine power. Why did Xue Dong lose so badly?</p><p>it’s divine power. His divine power is almost at the stage of awakening the origin factor!</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>“What? The origin factor?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>However, there were some people who were stunned.</p><p>What was the origin factor?</p><p>“What is the origin factor?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He had never heard of it before.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you don’t know about the origin factor?”</p><p>Wu Ming looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“I don’t know, brother woo. What is the origin factor?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to shake his head and continued asking.</p><p>the origin factor is the origin of a type of divine power. We have to start from the very beginning of divine power. Brother Lu, you should know that the primeval universe has been divided into two eras since the beginning of time, right? ”</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Yeah, I know. Two eras. The earliest one was the incipient God Realm and the later one was the heaven Palace era!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He had already read about this in the ancient records.</p><p>The long history of the primal universe was divided into the incipient God Realm era and the heaven Palace era.</p><p>The incipient God Realm was the beginning of the universe. At that time, the world had given birth to so many powerful existences. They were called the incipient God Realm or the original God Realm.</p><p>The ancient God clan was also one of the incipient God Realm experts.</p><p>And now, it was the later stage of the heavenly Palace era.</p><p>in the incipient God Realm, the powerful existences that were born naturally could control God Power. They had different kinds of God Power, and those god powers were all extremely powerful. They were called the origin God Power. The God power of today can’t be compared to them!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Even divine-grade divine power can’t?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No, I’m far from it!”</p><p>&Nbsp; Wu Ming shook his head and said, ” divine-grade divine power can’t be compared to origin divine power at all. In terms of quality, it’s like the difference between rotten wood and gold!</p><p>even in the beginning of the heaven Palace era, divine-grade divine power was the most basic divine power, not to mention the incipient God era. Anyone who cultivated it with some talent could control divine-grade divine power!</p><p>however, as time passed, the divine Qi of the primeval universe became thinner and thinner, and the origin became rarer and rarer. The cultivators were scattered all over the universe, so it became more and more difficult to control high-quality divine power. In the end, it evolved into divine-grade divine power, sacred-grade divine power, King-grade divine power, and ordinary divine power!</p><p>Wu Ming spoke with fervour and assurance. He was born in a great aristocratic family and knew a lot about the history of the desolate universe.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. He did not expect that at the beginning of the era of the heavenly Palace, the divine energy that a cultivator controlled was a divine-grade divine energy.</p><p>But what did this have to do with the origin factor of Shen power?</p><p>Lu Ming did not say anything and waited for Wu Ming to continue.</p><p>&Nbsp; as expected, Wu Ming continued, ” strictly speaking, sacred-grade divine power, King-grade divine power, and ordinary divine power are all unqualified divine powers. These divine powers have very limited potential. Cultivating to the divine King realm is already the limit. It’s impossible to continue breaking through!</p><p>the reason is that it is impossible to awaken the origin factor in this divine power. Only divine-grade divine power can awaken the origin factor!</p><p>“In truth, every kind of divine-grade divine power is evolved from the original origin divine power. In the end, every kind of divine-grade divine power can find a corresponding origin divine power!”</p><p>therefore, as long as one continuously awakens the origin factor, in the end, divine-grade divine power can be transformed into the corresponding origin divine power. One can control the origin and have infinite power!</p><p>Wu Ming said. At this point, his eyes were filled with a burning flame.</p><p>“Then how can I awaken the origin factor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. His heart was burning.</p><p>Jing Yu didn’t leave behind any of this knowledge, and the universe thousand Dao Arts didn’t record it either.</p><p>to comprehend and use it, I have to continuously comprehend and control the divine-grade divine power and use it continuously. When I reach a certain level, I will naturally be able to activate the origin factor!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“In that case, Leng Ying has activated the origin factor?” Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s impossible. The origin factor is not that easy to activate. It’s terrifyingly difficult. I’m afraid not even one out of a hundred geniuses who can control divine-grade divine power can activate it. The chances will only be higher if one’s cultivation has reached the upper echelons of the divine King realm!</p><p>I estimate that Leng Ying is only close to activating his origin factor. Even so, his divine power will become extremely strong and powerful!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had a general understanding of the origin factor of divine power.</p><p>It seemed that his previous understanding of Shen power had been wrong.</p><p>Every kind of divine-grade divine power had great potential to be unearthed.</p><p>then it seems that I’ve taken the wrong path of cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had ten types of divine power in his body, but only two were divine-grade divine power.</p><p>According to Wu Ming, other than divine-grade divine power, no matter if it was sacred-grade, King-grade, or ordinary divine power, they were all incomplete and had limited potential.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
