That damned Wu family!</p><p>One of the black-robed men roared.</p><p>They thought that the Wu family had sent an expert to protect Lu Ming and the rest in secret. That was why the men of sacrifice they had sent were all annihilated.</p><p>“It’s too late to continue sending experts to kill them. What should we do? It’ll be hard to make a move once they enter the universal camp!”</p><p>A black-robed man said.</p><p>we can only report the situation to the higher-ups and ask for his Lord’s decision. However, even if he enters the universal camp, don’t think that he’s safe. Let’s go!</p><p>With a flash, the black-robed men disappeared without a trace.</p><p>……</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were even more careful along the way. Fortunately, they did not encounter any danger.</p><p>Not long after, they finally arrived at the universal camp.</p><p>“This is the universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the barren land in front of him and was somewhat stunned.</p><p>this is all an illusion. There’s a formation in front of us. Let’s continue!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>The four of them continued forward and stepped into the barren land.</p><p>At this moment, the space around Lu Ming and the rest suddenly rippled. Then, two white-haired elders suddenly appeared.</p><p>this is the star sky Camp. Why have four little kids come here? ”</p><p>An old man said.</p><p>“Two seniors, we’re here to join the universal camp!”</p><p>Wu Ming bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Oh? Do you have any proof?” The old man who spoke earlier continued.</p><p>“Senior, please take a look!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming and the other three took out the Demon King and demon master tokens.</p><p>One of the elders waved his hand, and the tokens in the four people’s hands were collected. After carefully identifying them, he said, ” it’s the proof for one of the assessments. Congratulations on joining the universal camp!</p><p>With that, he waved his hand, and space fluctuated. Then, a door of light appeared out of thin air.</p><p>“Go in!”</p><p>The two old men waved their hands.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three cupped their fists and stepped into the light door.</p><p>After stepping through the door of light, Lu Ming and the rest arrived at a square.</p><p>“What a dense divine Qi!”</p><p>As soon as he entered, Lu Ming could feel that the divine Qi here was much stronger than outside.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sized him up.</p><p>There were already many people gathered in the square. At a glance, there were a few hundred people.</p><p>it seems like we’re late. The others are already here!</p><p>Wuyue said.</p><p>It was obvious that these people were the same as Lu Ming and the rest. They were newcomers who had just joined the universal camp.</p><p>“It’s them!” Lu Ming swept his gaze and saw some familiar faces.</p><p>For example, the blood-robed young man, Wu Xue, and the others he had met on Magic City mountain.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you!”</p><p>Wu Xue and the rest also saw Lu Ming and looked at him with unfriendly eyes.</p><p>“Haha, we’re really fated to meet here again!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>hehe, it’s fate. Kid, we’ll see what happens next!</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother, the blood-soaked youth, said coldly.</p><p>“You’re still lacking!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>Wu Xue’s senior brother shouted coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent.</p><p>He could not fight here and he was indeed not Lu Ming’s match. However, this was the universal camp and many of his senior and junior brothers were in the universal camp. He would definitely teach Lu Ming a lesson in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and could not be bothered with these people. He walked to the side with Qiu Yue, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest and waited quietly.</p><p>Another hour passed, and a dozen more people arrived.</p><p>At this time, a shadow flashed in the sky, and a burly man in linen clothes appeared.</p><p>welcome to the universal unit. Now, follow me, I’ll arrange your accommodation!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“I’ll have to trouble senior!”</p><p>Some people cupped their fists.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>The burly man laughed meaningfully, then turned around and left, followed by the others.</p><p>After flying past the square, a huge mountain appeared in front of them.</p><p>This peak covered a vast area and was very high, at least hundreds of thousands of feet high. From a distance, one could see many buildings built on the peak.</p><p>In the distance, the burly man landed on the ground, followed by everyone else.</p><p>with that mountain as the center, 100000 miles around it is the core area of the universal camp. In the future, all of you will be cultivating and resting within that area!</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Many people nodded.</p><p>also, let me tell you. All new members are not allowed to fly in that area. You can only walk. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The burly man said.</p><p>“You can’t fly? Could it be that there’s a flight prohibiting formation there?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>no, there’s no space-sealing formation inside. Even a hollow spirit realm cultivator can fly freely. However, no flying is allowed. That’s the rule!</p><p>At this point, the burly man paused for a moment and sneered, ” whoever breaks the rules will be immediately expelled from the universal camp and will never be hired again!</p><p>“Expelled from the universal camp forever?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>There was a rule in the great void Holy dynasty that if one wanted to enter the core grounds of the great void Holy dynasty to cultivate, one must be recommended by the universal camp before one could enter.</p><p>In the future, if he wanted to climb up and obtain status and fame in the great void Holy dynasty, he had to go through this step.</p><p>If they were expelled from the universal camp, they would lose the opportunity to cultivate in the core grounds of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Not only that, even if their cultivations were higher in the future, it would be difficult for them to gain any reputation in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>It wasn’t easy for them to join the star sky Camp, so they definitely wouldn’t allow themselves to be expelled.</p><p>He couldn’t fly!</p><p>Many people firmly remembered this in their hearts.</p><p>“Alright, follow me!”</p><p>After the burly man finished speaking, he strode forward.</p><p>Although they couldn’t fly and could only walk on foot, they were still as fast as lightning even on foot with their cultivation. After a while, they entered the range of one hundred thousand miles from the mountain.</p><p>The closer they got to the peak, the denser the divine Qi was. There was even a strange fluctuation in the space that could clear one’s mind and active thoughts.</p><p>I feel like I can comprehend divine skills and cultivate secret techniques much faster here!</p><p>me too. It’s said that the mountain peak is called Star Peak. At the top of Star Peak, there’s a Supreme treasure that is constantly emitting a strange fluctuation. Under the influence of this fluctuation, one’s perception will become much stronger. It’s true!</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices, their faces filled with excitement.</p><p>“I hope you can still laugh after this!”</p><p>The burly man chuckled.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Many of them looked at each other in dismay after hearing the burly man’s words.</p><p>The burly man didn’t answer and continued to move forward.</p><p>Soon, they were about to reach the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, there was a sound above their heads. A few young men whizzed past them.</p><p>“There’s a newcomer!”</p><p>“Time really flies!”</p><p>The few young men chatted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
