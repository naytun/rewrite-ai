She had finally caught up to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was amazed. Ever since Qiu Yue awakened her nine-orifice Saint heart, her cultivation speed was amazing.</p><p>Even if he did not have any fortuitous encounters, his cultivation speed would still advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>Since two hundred years ago, Lu Ming’s authority in the Kong Xuan sect had increased. Almost no one would go against what he said. Therefore, Qiu Yue could freely enter and exit the various cultivation sanctuaries in the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had given her a large number of resources to help her. Qiu Yue’s cultivation level was improving at an alarming rate.</p><p>Now, Qiu Yue had already broken through to the first-tier celestial God Realm and was on par with Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu Yue had also cultivated the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture to the highest level and successfully cultivated ruler divine power. Her battle-power was also extremely strong.</p><p>In all the major sects, he would be a deity level figure. Of course, no one knew about this.</p><p>“Qiuyue, take these divine techniques and cultivate them!”</p><p>Lu Ming passed the indestructible sword technique, multi-eyed divine technique, chilliness divine technique, and other divine techniques to Qiu Yue.</p><p>With Qiu Yue’s talent, it was only a matter of time before she cultivated many types of Shen power.</p><p>Moreover, with the mystery of Qiu Yue’s nine-orifice Saint heart, her cultivation speed would not be slow even if she controlled many types of divine power.</p><p>If it had been anyone else, even if they had the universe thousand Dao Scripture to cultivate many Shen powers, his cultivation speed would be as slow as a snail.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ” measure ” formula and Qiu Yue had a nine-orifice Saint heart. They did not have such concerns.</p><p>“So many!”</p><p>Qiu Yue was also shocked to see so many divine techniques.</p><p>of course. Don’t you know what kind of person your young master is? it’s no big deal for him to obtain these divine techniques. I’ll give you more in the future.</p><p>Lu Ming started to boast.</p><p>“Qiuyue knew it, young master is the best!”</p><p>Qiu Yue blinked her big eyes and kissed Lu Ming’s lips. Then, she immediately retracted her hand. However, Lu Ming reached out and held Qiu Yue’s slender waist, pulling her into his arms.</p><p>you know how powerful young master is, right? I’ll make it up to young master today!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled evilly.</p><p>“Young master is up to no good again!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>“Then, I’ll show you how bad I am!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud. He carried Qiu Yue and entered a room.</p><p>In the days that followed, Qiu Yue cultivated various divine techniques under Lu Ming’s guidance. Her progress was astonishing, and even Lu Ming felt ashamed of his inferiority.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three years had passed.</p><p>On this day, the senior statesman of Kong Xuan sect suddenly sent Lu Ming a message, saying that there was something important.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to the meeting hall and found Ouyang Qingxiang and the other Holy Sons there.</p><p>When the sacred son of reflection and the rest saw Lu Ming, their faces turned pale and they were in awe.</p><p>“Greetings, Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sacred son of reflection and the rest greeted Lu Ming politely.</p><p>Now, if Lu Ming said one, they would definitely not dare to say two.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded casually and swept his gaze across the entire venue.</p><p>In addition to the Holy Sons and holy virgins, the elders of the Kong Xuan sect, and many inner sect elders, almost all of them were present.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>The doyens and inner sect elders also greeted Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>“Everyone, why have you all gathered here today?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’ve received news not long ago that an emissary from the great void Holy dynasty is coming to our Kong Xuan sect!”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang said.</p><p>“The great void Holy dynasty!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly bloomed with a brilliant glow.</p><p>Lu Ming had long known that the great void Holy dynasty was a universal power that ruled a vast territory. It had countless star zones and was vast and boundless.</p><p>The Qin heaven star region was a remote star region under the rule of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Because of Jing Yu’s matter, Lu Ming had to make a trip to the great void Holy dynasty sooner or later. He did not expect that an emissary from the great void Holy dynasty would suddenly arrive.</p><p>“Why did the emissary from the great void Holy dynasty suddenly come to the Kong Xuan sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, his mind spinning rapidly.</p><p>Could it be that the people of the great void sacred dynasty knew of his relationship with Jing Yu and had come for him?</p><p>That’s impossible. He didn’t reveal anything about Jing Yu. The people of the great void sacred dynasty shouldn’t know about this.</p><p>What was the reason?</p><p>we do not know either. In the vast great void Holy dynasty, the Qin heaven star region is located far away. The great void Holy dynasty has always been indifferent and rarely sends their emissaries over. We do not know why they suddenly sent their emissaries over this time? ”</p><p>Ouyang Qingxiang also frowned.</p><p>The rest of the people also had a serious look on their faces. They did not know if the arrival of the great void Holy dynasty’s emissary was a blessing or a curse.</p><p>Although the Kong Xuan sect was the Overlord of the Qin heaven Galaxy, they were like ants compared to the great void Holy dynasty. It was like the difference between an ant and a Divine Dragon. In fact, they were not even comparable to an ant.</p><p>Any random expert from the great void Holy dynasty could destroy the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Therefore, they couldn’t help but feel nervous.</p><p>“They are not from the royal family of the great void Holy dynasty, but from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor.”</p><p>At this moment, Yue Wu Ya spoke.</p><p>“Nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>Some people, including Lu Ming, looked puzzled.</p><p>you guys might not be clear about the division of power in the great void Holy dynasty. Let me explain it to you!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said. After sorting out her thoughts, she continued,”The great void Holy dynasty uses a enfeoffment system!”</p><p>other than the royal family of the great void Holy dynasty occupying the core and best territories, there are 27 Heavenly Kings. These 27 Heavenly Kings are all top experts of the great void Holy dynasty and have made great contributions to the great void Holy dynasty!</p><p>the 27 Heavenly Kings have established 27 Heavenly King manors, each ruling a territory, like a country within a country. Their strength is also very shocking.</p><p>and our Qin heaven Starfield is under the rule of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had a general understanding of the power structure of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>The 27 Heavenly Kings were the Lords of a region in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>However, everyone’s expression did not relax.</p><p>To them, regardless of whether it was the royal family of the great void Holy dynasty or the nine absolute Heavenly King House, they were all Giants that they could not fight against. There was no difference.</p><p>the envoy from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion is about to arrive. Let’s go out and welcome him!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said.</p><p>Immediately, all the higher-ups of the Kong Xuan sect flew out into outer space. They stood in space and waited quietly.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>About half an hour later, a Dragon’s Roar could be heard from afar.</p><p>Then, everyone saw nine giant divine Dragons pulling a chariot toward them.</p><p>The nine divine Dragons were Scarlet all over and were 10000 meters long. Their auras were extremely shocking, and each of them gave off a terrifying pressure.</p><p>a peak heavenly God Divine Dragon is pulling the carriage. What a big move!</p><p>An elder sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
