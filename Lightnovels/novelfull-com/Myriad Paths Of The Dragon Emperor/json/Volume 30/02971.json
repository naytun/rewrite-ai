All sorts of attacks were directed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He shook his long spear and shot out more than a dozen spearlights at the paragons.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had now broken through to the fourth-level celestial deity realm and his strength was at its peak. As for the blood-robed youth and the rest, they had suffered some injuries from the night Demon King’s self-destruction of half of its star core.</p><p>Therefore, even if they joined forces, they were not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>The spear radiance was dazzling and sharp. It pierced through the attacks of the blood-robed youth and the others.</p><p>The blood-robed youth and the others trembled and retreated.</p><p>“You want to kill me with your strength?”</p><p>A mocking voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. He held his spear and charged forward. The long spear shook and a huge spear ray swept out.</p><p>The blood-robed young man and the others looked ghastly. They shouted angrily and each of them used their unique skills. However, they were not Lu Ming’s match and were forced to retreat.</p><p>damn it! How can this kid’s strength be so shocking? ”</p><p>The blood-robed youth and the others roared in their hearts.</p><p>They were the proud Children of Heaven from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, but they had never seen Lu Ming before. Where did Lu Ming come from?</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to step forward with a violent aura.</p><p>The expressions of the blood-robed youth and company changed again, and they couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming advanced while they retreated. They no longer had the courage to fight.</p><p>In their current situation, even if they fought again, they would still be defeated.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>In the end, the blood-robed young man and the rest were unwilling to give up. They used their movement techniques and drifted backward, distancing themselves from Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cowards, you still want my storage ring? Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>The blood-robed youth’s expression was extremely unsightly.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll remember what happened today!”</p><p>The blood-robed young man left these words coldly and left in a flash.</p><p>The other young geniuses also cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. They had no choice but to leave.</p><p>Not long after, all the heaven’s favorites here had left.</p><p>“Let’s search this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue and the rest as his body shrunk.</p><p>After that, they rushed into the city Lord’s mansion and started searching to see if they could find any clues.</p><p>Originally, the majestic and grand city Lord’s mansion had already collapsed. It was in shambles and there was not a single person. Lu Ming and the rest were shuttling back and forth in the dilapidated city Lord’s mansion to see if they could find any clues about the dark ice Race and the nine absolute Heavenly King’s mansion.</p><p>They didn’t notice that a person had appeared not far from the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>This person was the Daughter of the Night Devil King, night rose.</p><p>In the previous battle, night rose had not appeared.</p><p>Night rose looked at Lu Ming and the rest who were in the distance. Her eyes were filled with hatred, greed, and other complicated emotions.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, sooner or later, I will ‘swallow’ you. Hehehe!”</p><p>A cold sneer came out of night Rose’s mouth. With an evil light in her eyes, she disappeared in a flash.</p><p>Just as the night rose disappeared, two black shadows appeared out of thin air.</p><p>These two black figures were wrapped in black robes, and their faces could not be seen clearly. Only a pair of cold eyes could be seen under the black robes.</p><p>“What do we do? The dark night’s storage ring is in that kid’s hands!”</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>with our strength, we’re not this kid’s match at all!</p><p>The other person said.</p><p>however, the night Demon King’s storage ring must not fall into the hands of outsiders. We must get it!</p><p>The first person said.</p><p>“The plan now is to secretly keep an eye on them, then send back a message and ask the master to send experts to kill them!”</p><p>The person behind said.</p><p>“Alright, that’s the only way!”</p><p>The first person said. After he finished speaking, the two of them disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others were completely unaware that they were being watched. They had searched the city Lord Mansion several times and found many treasures. However, they did not find any clues about the dark ice Race colluding with the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion or the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>I wonder if there are any clues in the night Demon Lord’s storage ring? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>After searching for two more rounds, there were still no clues. Lu Ming, Qiu Yue, and the rest left the place.</p><p>Not long after, they found a hidden place. Lu Ming took out the night Demon Lord’s storage ring and checked it.</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned when he took a look.</p><p>&Nbsp; the night Demon King controlled mo yequan and had accumulated a lot of wealth over the years.</p><p>In the storage ring, there were all kinds of precious divine pills, divine medicines, and divine materials.</p><p>There were also divine weapons of all levels, and there were even a few Supreme-grade divine weapons.</p><p>As for divine crystals, there were countless of them.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also found a divine-grade wondrous technique.</p><p>This divine grade technique could be cultivated to divine grade divine power when cultivated to its peak. However, the night Demon King clearly had not cultivated to the highest realm, or his strength would be even stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. Of course, he had to cultivate this Divine Art.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also discovered a large number of demon night Springs.</p><p>It weighed more than 500 Jin.</p><p>good Lord, I guess all the demon night spring in the entire demon Capital Mountain is here. No wonder I couldn’t find it before!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Then, he took out 20 catties of demon night spring and gave them to Yue Linglong and Wu Zifeng, giving them 10 catties each.</p><p>Five kilograms of demon night spring was enough for them to use for a long time.</p><p>The two of them were naturally ecstatic as they kept it.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give it to Qiu Yue. He would give her however much she wanted to use. There was no need to give it to her on purpose.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s disappointment, he did not find any clues about the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion in the night Demon King’s storage ring.</p><p>did the night Demon King not leave any clues? ”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>Then, he checked the storage rings of the demon masters but did not find any clues.</p><p>However, a few tokens appeared in his hand.</p><p>A total of four pieces!</p><p>A Demon King token and three demon master tokens were indeed what Wu Xue and the others had come here for.</p><p>the Demon King’s token, the demon master’s token. As long as you have this, you can join the universal camp!</p><p>Wu Zifeng’s eyes flashed, revealing a trace of fiery light.</p><p>“Did we just come out of nowhere? You can also join the universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>yes, as long as one’s age doesn’t exceed the limit and their cultivation is above heavenly God, as long as they have the Demon King and Demon King’s token, they can enter the universal camp!</p><p>Wu Zifeng said. After that, Wu Zifeng muttered to himself for a moment and then continued, brother Lu, if you want to investigate the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, why don’t you join the universal camp first? after all, the universal camp and the guards of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion are very close. You might be able to get some clues!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
