Lu Ming, go to hell!”</p><p>He looked at Lu Ming coldly. Four beams of destructive light shot out toward Lu Ming.</p><p>If he was hit, Lu Ming would die without a doubt.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s tightly shut eyes suddenly opened. A cold murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two spearlights burst out from Lu Ming’s hands. They were more dazzling than meteors.</p><p>The spear light shook and the four destructive lights in the four eyes were scattered.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>ah! a shrill scream reverberated through the entire area. Then, a bloody light burst out, and a figure quickly retreated.</p><p>This figure was four-eyed kongting. At this moment, four-eyed kongting was roaring madly. His two eyes had disappeared and were replaced by two bloody holes.</p><p>Two of the four-eyed void’s eyes were blinded by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re looking for death, you’re looking for death! I’m going to tear you into pieces!”</p><p>Kong ting’s body began swelling up, and he actually turned into a giant worm.</p><p>This giant worm was more than a hundred meters long and was covered in disgusting tentacles. This was the true form of the four-eyed void court.</p><p>In fact, many of the polyeye’s true forms were not from the same race, but a variety of different races.</p><p>The four-eyed void turned back into its original form and pounced at Lu Ming, unleashing its full strength.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   Lu Ming said coldly, his body rapidly growing in size as he transformed into a green-armored ancient God. He swept his spear forward, his divine power Overwhelming the four-eye void.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming had now broken through to the first-tier celestial God, and he was even at the peak of the first-tier celestial God Realm. His divine power was much more robust than before. The long spear pressed down, breaking through the four-eye void’s attack and defense like a piece of rotten wood, and bombarded his body.</p><p>The four-eyed Void King’s huge body was sent flying. A section of his body exploded, and blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>“You’re the one who’s going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He took a step forward and covered a hundred miles. His long spear was like a shooting star, piercing towards the four-eyed void.</p><p>“Ah, Zhuo Buzhu, quickly come and help me!”</p><p>The four-eyed void beast screamed in horror. At the same time, it unleashed its full strength to resist Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out. Zhuo Buzhu made his move. The sword radiance was like a flying celestial light, cutting through the void and slashing towards Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Zhuo bumu was not the only one. The other paragons of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect also made their moves at the same time and launched terrifying killing moves at Lu Ming.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Hmph! Lu Ming snorted coldly. His eyes were icy cold and his left hand emitted a dazzling radiance. He threw a punch at Zhuo Buzhu. The moment he threw the punch, three nine-clawed divine Dragons flew out from Lu Ming’s left fist.</p><p>This was the divine Dragon phenomenon.</p><p>As Lu Ming continued to comprehend the divine Dragon materialization art, his understanding became deeper and deeper. When he used it, he was more adept at it. He could condense three Divine Dragon phenomenon with one punch.</p><p>The three Divine Dragon materialization Arts pounced towards Zhuo buhua. Lu Ming ignored the attacks of the other prodigies and allowed them to attack him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear did not stop and continued to stab at the four-eyed void.</p><p>The four-eyed void beast was shocked and furious. It unleashed its full power and set up layers of defenses in front of it. However, when the long spear stabbed down, these defenses shattered continuously. Then, Lu Ming’s long spear pierced through the four-eyed void beast’s head and nailed it to the ground.</p><p>Four-eyed Kong ting was still alive and was still struggling madly.</p><p>On the other side, the three divine Dragons blocked Zhuo buhua’s attack while the attacks of the other prodigies landed on Lu Ming. However, they could only barely break through Lu Ming’s defense and leave shallow wounds on his body. To Lu Ming, they were no different from tickles.</p><p>“Ah, Lu Ming, don’t kill me, don’t kill me …”</p><p>Four eyes screamed in fear and began to beg for mercy.</p><p>In actual fact, he was not that weak. If he had fought Lu Ming with all his might, he would not have been crushed so easily.</p><p>The main reason was that he was caught off guard and Lu Ming had blinded him in both eyes.</p><p>The eyes of the multi-eyed race were their vital points. Once they were blinded, their strength would be greatly affected. That was why he was easily crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Four-eye void court wanted to kill him at every turn. How could he let four-eye void court off? Lu Ming shook his spear and a terrifying power burst forth, exploding from four-eye void court’s body. Four-eye void court’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>Zhuo Wu FA’s pupils rapidly contracted as his figure retreated.</p><p>“All of you, stay!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. The long spear swept out with the momentum of sweeping away thousands of troops.</p><p>A spear light as long as a mountain range swept toward the geniuses of the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect. At the same time, a crescent-shaped spear light burst forth.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>The expressions of the geniuses from the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect changed drastically, and they all retreated frantically. However, they were still a step too late.</p><p>As the spear pressed down, the bodies of a few weaker cultivators exploded.</p><p>A few of the stronger ones were also sent flying like cannonballs. They crashed into a few mountain peaks and shattered them. They were all seriously injured.</p><p>Among the crowd, Zhuo Buzhu was in a better position. He continuously struck out with his sword, and the sword light slashed on the crescent-shaped spear light, making a violent roar. Although his sword light also shattered, he used this force to float back a thousand miles. Only a trace of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>this person is too terrifying. Let’s retreat first!</p><p>Zhuo Wu fa did not hesitate at all, turning into a sword light and flying into the distance.</p><p>“Stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and threw the long spear in his hand. The long spear shot out like lightning and shot towards Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>Zhuo Wu FA’s expression changed, and thousands of sword lights shot out from his hands, slashing at the spear.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang …’</p><p>The spear and the sword light emitted a series of explosions. In the end, all the sword light shattered. The spear light flashed and Zhuo Buzhu let out a blood-curdling scream. His abdomen had been pierced by the spear and blood was flowing out.</p><p>He didn’t dare to stop. Even with his injuries, he used all his strength to run. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p><p>“It’s a pity …”</p><p>Lu Ming did not pursue him. Zhuo Buzhu cultivated the sword. Not only was his attack powerful, but his speed was also extremely shocking. Even if Lu Ming wanted to catch up, he might not be able to.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the severely injured geniuses from the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites ‘faces turned pale. They were all terrified.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t kill us!” He shouted.</p><p>my senior brother desk has already escaped. If you kill us, the indestructible sword sect will not let you off.</p><p>The geniuses of the Yimo Academy and the immortal sword sect shouted one after another. They were all Saint children, and they did not want to die Here.</p><p>“I can spare your lives if you swear on your life essence that you will pledge your loyalty to me in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
