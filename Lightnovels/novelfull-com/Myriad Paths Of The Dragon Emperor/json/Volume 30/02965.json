Beams of divine light were triggered and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming protected Qiu Yue and the other two as he retreated. At this moment, the green scales on his body were cracked in many places and blood was flowing out.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with tears. She gritted her teeth and made a move, wanting to share some of the pressure with Lu Ming.</p><p>However, although Qiu Yue’s current cultivation had reached the second-tier celestial God Realm, she had not cultivated many other divine powers. Her combat strength was far inferior to Lu Ming’s and she could not play a critical role. Instead, she was injured by the backlash.</p><p>“Qiuyue, don’t attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue’s eyes were filled with tears.</p><p>“Haha, brat, go to hell!”</p><p>Wan Xing stood in the distance and laughed loudly. His eyes swept across Qiu Yue and Yue Linglong, and his gaze flickered with a scorching flame.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to have two such beautiful girls by your side. How come I didn’t notice them before? what a pity. But it doesn’t matter. After I kill you, I’ll love them well. Hahaha!”</p><p>Wan Xing laughed madly, his face full of ferocity and desire.</p><p>“Wan Xing, I will definitely kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“You’re still daydreaming about killing me!”</p><p>Wan Xing ridiculed and was arrogant. He was not afraid at all.</p><p>At this moment, divine light shot up into the sky from the city Lord’s mansion, and a terrifying tremor came.</p><p>They could see everything clearly.</p><p>not good! There’s a huge battle at the city Lord’s mansion!</p><p>The demon masters ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>damn it, it’s those foreign heaven’s favorites. These guys are definitely in cahoots. They’re trying to split our strength!</p><p>Dragon Cave shouted angrily.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming had also noticed the situation at the city Lord’s residence and was rather surprised.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the foreign heaven’s favorites would attack the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>it seems that the paragons from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion didn’t come to demonic city just for mo yequan!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>attack with all your might and kill this brat. We’ll go and support the city Lord’s mansion!</p><p>At this moment, all evil roared.</p><p>“Alright, attack with all your might and kill him!”</p><p>“Full force!”</p><p>The other two demon masters also nodded and gave the order.</p><p>Immediately, the three great demon kings and 2500 Demon City guards madly circulated their divine power and blasted out their divine power as if it was free.</p><p>Then, a huge beam of light, like a huge divine sword, slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this divine sword had reached its peak.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted sharply. He felt a fatal crisis.</p><p>However, he, Qiu Yue, and the others were surrounded by the formation and had no way to escape. They could only fight.</p><p>“Block it, I must block it …”</p><p>Lu Ming growled in his heart and unleashed his full power.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and the seven nine-clawed divine Dragons rushed out first.</p><p>Immediately after, nine ice chains appeared.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The huge divine light formed a sword and slashed down. The seven nine-clawed divine Dragons exploded one by one.</p><p>Then, the nine ice chains also exploded.</p><p>However, this had more or less blocked some of the power of the combat sword.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming waved his long spear and blocked in front of him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently when the combat sword hit the long spear. He could not even stand in the air. His body, which was hundreds of meters tall, fell down to the fighting ring below.</p><p>The fighting ring of the Colosseum was made of special materials and was extremely hard. Even the strong Qi from the previous battle did not break the fighting ring.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming landed heavily on the fighting ring. The fighting ring rumbled violently and cracks appeared on it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body bent and he almost knelt down.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. He used all his divine power and divine body’s power to resist the attack and did not kneel down.</p><p>However, the huge sword had a steady stream of power that blasted down. Lu Ming’s body trembled as if he was carrying a majestic divine mountain.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Evil and the others felt their hearts Twitch as they gasped.</p><p>They had already used their strongest move and wanted to kill Lu Ming in one move. They did not expect that Lu Ming would be able to withstand it.</p><p>“Continue, kill him!”</p><p>A thousand evils roared.</p><p>Then, the three demon masters and more than 2500 demonic city guards circulated their divine power madly. The divine power gathered and gushed toward the combat sword, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fighting ring under Lu Ming’s feet exploded with a loud bang and fragments flew everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body bent slightly, but he roared and resisted it.</p><p>More blood flowed out of the wounds on his body.</p><p>“Young master …”</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Qiu Yue, Yue Linglong, and Wu Zifeng were extremely anxious. They wanted to intervene, but with their cultivation, they couldn’t do much.</p><p>“I can’t go on like this. If this continues, I won’t be able to hold on any longer!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>If this continued, the four of them would die Here if he couldn’t hold on any longer. In fact, the consequences would be worse than death.</p><p>“Right now, the only way is to break through …”</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Now, there were only two ways.</p><p>One of them was to burn his ancient God heart, and the other was to break through.</p><p>However, after the ancient God’s heart was burned, his ancient God Body would be completely destroyed.</p><p>The last time, it was because of the purple copper coffin that his heart of the ancient God recovered. However, that kind of good luck couldn’t be there every time.</p><p>Moreover, bone wasn’t with him this time. If he took the risk to open the purple copper coffin, he wouldn’t even know how he died.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming would not use this method unless he had no other choice.</p><p>The other way was to break through.</p><p>For example, the battle symbol art had a breakthrough to five times the combat power.</p><p>However, it was clear that the breakthrough of the battle character formula required comprehension and accumulation. It was not easy to break through. The only thing that could be broken through was cultivation.</p><p>“Old Liang, how much energy have you refined from the star’s core?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>“I’ve given you all the energy I refined the last time. How much energy can I refine in such a short time? It’s too little, not enough for you to break through!”</p><p>The quantity formula responded.</p><p>“Then transfer the energy of the star core to me directly!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Directly transfer the energy of the star core to you? The energy of this kind of star core is extremely violent. Even a Divine King would have to spend a lot of time to refine it before they can use it. You’re just a heavenly God Realm expert. If I give it to you, I’m afraid you’ll die from overeating!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>there’s no other way. We can only take a gamble now. Transfer energy to me, but control it well and not transfer too much. I can hold on!</p><p>Lu Ming said to the ” measure ” word art with a determined look in his eyes.</p><p>you’re crazy, kid. Alright, let’s go all out. I’ll go all out with you. Kid, get ready!</p><p>The quantity formula helplessly agreed.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ” measure ” formula went berserk. A violent wave of energy rushed into Lu Ming’s body from the ” measure ” formula.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
