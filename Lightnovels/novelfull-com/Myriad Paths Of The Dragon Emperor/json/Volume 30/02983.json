Now, I’ll let you see my true strength!</p><p>die! Leng Ying shouted as his aura surged. He circulated his divine power and formed a giant Divine Eagle around him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cry of a Goshawk was heard. The frigid Eagle pounced toward Lu Ming, its sharp claws tearing through the air as it tried to grab him.</p><p>“You’re not the only one who didn’t use your full strength!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Lu Ming growled coldly. Then, his body swelled rapidly, turning into a green-armored ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear trembled and swept out horizontally. It was as if a Gale was blowing on the mountain peak.</p><p>In the next moment, Leng Ying’s eagle claws grabbed Lu Ming’s huge long spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The eagle’s talons grabbed onto the spear, causing a violent boom and ear-piercing friction sound. Sparks flew in all directions.</p><p>The two of them clashed for a few seconds before the spear radiance trembled and retracted. However, icehawk’s body was also forced back. He only managed to stabilize himself after retreating tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>His pair of claws were placed behind his back, trembling slightly to avoid being seen by others.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had completely exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“What terrifying divine power!”</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>This included some of the senior members and even the members who lived on Star Peak. They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>No one had expected Lu Ming to have such combat strength.</p><p>ancient God Body, that’s the ancient God Body. I didn’t think that this person would have cultivated the ancient God Body to such a level. It’s amazing!</p><p>what’s even more shocking is that he’s only a fourth level celestial deity!</p><p>The surrounding area was filled with discussions.</p><p>He didn’t expect that there would be such a powerful heaven’s favorite among this batch of newcomers.</p><p>I really didn’t expect that there would be a heaven’s favorite like you among the new members this time. You’re quite strong. On account of your strength, I won’t hold it against you today. You can go!</p><p>Icehawk said, waving his hand.</p><p>“You’re not going to argue? Hehe, I didn’t say I wouldn’t care!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming did not intend to let the other party off easily if he wanted to touch his woman.</p><p>“What do you want to do?”</p><p>Icehawk’s face darkened.</p><p>I’ve taken a fancy to your courtyard. Now, take your things and get lost!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming was initially considering who he should challenge. He did not expect that Leng Ying would take the initiative to provoke him. He would start with him.</p><p>“Brat, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!”</p><p>Leng Ying shouted coldly, his killing intent cold.</p><p>“I like to drink the hard way, so what? If you don’t get lost, then I’ll make you get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and strode towards Leng Ying. The huge long spear pressed down on Leng Ying with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!” Leng Ying bellowed. A huge godly Eagle formed around him. It carried him and soared into the sky, heading for Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them clashed for the second time. The sky trembled and thousands of Qi forces scattered in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly, but icehawk’s body retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Is this the power of someone who is about to awaken the divine power factor? It’s indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>He felt that Leng Ying’s Shen power was shockingly powerful. His attack power was extremely strong and had almost destroyed his Shen power.</p><p>If he did not have the ten types of Shen power and the support of the battle formula, he would not have been able to fight back.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and continued to charge at Leng Ying.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in the air. With every step he took, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon would dance out. After seven steps, seven nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed and they pounced at Leng Ying.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming’s long spear struck down, displaying the second move of the three apocalyptic strikes, moon-cutting.</p><p>He activated both his divine skill and secret skill at the same time. The terrifying attack was like a wave that crushed towards Leng Ying.</p><p>“Divine Eagle glory!”</p><p>Leng Ying let out a long cry. Feathers actually grew out of his skin, making the divine Eagle he had transformed into even more powerful.</p><p>The two of them exchanged blows in the void. In an instant, they had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“Frigid Eagle, we’re losing!”</p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p>In the battle between Leng Ying and Lu Ming, Leng Ying was at a disadvantage from the beginning to the end. He was being suppressed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Defeat was a matter of time, and it would be very soon.</p><p>As expected, Leng Ying barely managed to exchange a few dozen moves with Lu Ming before he was struck by Lu Ming’s spear. One of his wings of the divine Eagle form crumbled.</p><p>Icehawk’s expression changed drastically, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. In an instant, dozens of terrifying spear gleams were aimed at Leng Ying.</p><p>Each of the Spear’s gleam was equivalent to the power of Lu Ming’s space-piercing move at full force. If not for the constant supply of divine power from the quantity formula, Lu Ming would not have been able to squander his divine power like this.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>After being hit by these spear lights, the divine Eagle that Leng Ying had condensed completely collapsed. His body was pierced through by a spear light. The spear light brought his body and landed on the star Peak, nailing him to a rock.</p><p>Leng Ying was not dead. Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, that shot would have taken his life.</p><p>As he was new here, Lu Ming did not want to attract too much trouble.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded. They didn’t expect that icehawk would be defeated, and so miserably at that.</p><p>On the other hand, many of the senior members had grave looks on their faces. Lu Ming had given them a lot of pressure.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and the Spear’s gleam that was stuck in Leng Ying’s body disappeared. Leng Ying landed on the ground, coughing up a mouthful of blood. His injuries were very serious, and he would need at least ten days to half a month to fully recover.</p><p>“Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming was indifferent.</p><p>“Just you wait!”</p><p>Leng Ying left a vicious sentence before he staggered down the mountain.</p><p>Now that he had been defeated and chased out of the courtyard, he was no longer qualified to fly in this area and could only walk on his feet.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He stepped into the courtyard and swept his gaze across it.</p><p>The courtyard was huge and unique. Lu Ming liked it very much.</p><p>“Qiuyue, stay here with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming walked out and looked at Qiu Yue.</p><p>According to the rules, the owner of the courtyard could invite a few people to stay with him.</p><p>“Yes, young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>The other new members were all envious.</p><p>They were envious that Lu Ming could live on Star Peak instead of the smelly land at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>“Brother Wu Ming, brother Wu Yue, Let’s Stay Together!”</p><p>Lu Ming also invited Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>The courtyard was huge and had many rooms. It was not a problem for a few more people to live in.</p><p>“We don’t need it, we want to fight our way up with our own strength in the future!”</p><p>Wu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>that’s right. We’ll only be motivated if we stay below. In fact, there are other geniuses of the woo family who live above us, but they don’t feel any pressure if they come up directly!</p><p>Wuyue said.</p><p>“That’s good, I’ll wait for you guys up there!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not insist. He knew that Wu Ming and Wu Yue were right. He would only be motivated if he lived below.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
