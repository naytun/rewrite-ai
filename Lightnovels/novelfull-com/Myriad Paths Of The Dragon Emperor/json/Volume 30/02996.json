His strength was slightly weaker than the big-nosed young man. If he continued to fight, he would most likely not be his opponent as time went on.</p><p>He sneered and swept a glance at Lu Ming. Then, he turned into a rainbow and left the place.</p><p>As soon as the young man left, the big-nosed young man’s figure flashed and he appeared beside Lu Ming. A wisp of Qi activity locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said faintly with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“You’re not stupid either!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man’s eyes turned cold. A powerful aura burst out and enveloped the area within a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>The big-nosed young man had the cultivation of a ninth-tier celestial deity. Furthermore, his divine power had also awakened to a certain extent, but it was not even fifty percent.</p><p>if I remember correctly, I didn’t offend you. Tell me, who sent you to kill me? the Jin family or the Qin family? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Why are you asking so many questions when you’re about to die?” The big-nosed young man sneered.</p><p>“Oh, it’s fine if you don’t want to tell me. Other than the Jin family, there’s only the Qin family. But Speaking of which, your information isn’t that well-informed. Are you sure you can kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>This big-nosed young man most likely did not know that he had defeated icehawk. Otherwise, he would not be so confident.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The big-nosed young man was slightly stunned.</p><p>“I mean, I’ll send you on your way now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice rang out. As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming stepped forward. His body swelled up rapidly and he transformed into an ancient God Body.</p><p>At the same time, he activated the battle formula that multiplied his combat power by four. A violent aura pressed toward the big-nosed young man.</p><p>“This aura … It’s impossible …”</p><p>As soon as he sensed Lu Ming’s aura, the big-nosed young man’s expression changed drastically, and he was horrified.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura made his heart tremble.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming launched an attack. A huge spear ray pressed toward the big-nosed young man.</p><p>“Vanguard battle Dao!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man roared. A long spear appeared in his hand. He waved the long spear and suddenly, chariots appeared in the sky. There were even Warriors on the chariots.</p><p>The chariot rumbled toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The big-nosed young man came from the sun family, a great aristocratic family in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. This secret skill was unique to the sun family, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming’s spear ray pressed down, the chariots shattered one by one.</p><p>In an instant, all the chariots were shattered.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As the spear radiance pressed down, the big-nosed young man retreated and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can he be so strong?”</p><p>The big-nosed young man roared in his heart.</p><p>Indeed, he did not know that Lu Ming had defeated Leng Ying. Therefore, he thought that Lu Ming was merely a fourth-level celestial deity. No matter how talented he was, he would not be that strong.</p><p>He had never expected that he would be severely injured in just one move.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man immediately turned around and ran.</p><p>“It’s too late to escape now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and a kun Peng was formed. With a flap of its wings, Lu Ming quickly chased after the big-nosed young man.</p><p>Space-breaking!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his spear and thrust it forward. A ray of spear light shot toward the big-nosed young man at an alarming speed.</p><p>Seeing that he could not escape, the big-nosed young man roared and brandished his spear to block.</p><p>However, the result was that he was sent flying again, flying thousands of miles. His arm had exploded, and his injuries were even more serious.</p><p>The big-nosed young man’s combat strength was about the same as Leng Ying’s.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming had to put in some effort when he was fighting Leng Ying. However, now that Lu Ming was circulating seven types of divine-grade divine energy in his body, although most of the divine energy was not full, his strength had increased by a notch and he could already crush Leng Ying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you dare to kill me, the sun family will not let you off!”</p><p>The big-nosed young man roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. He launched a storm of attacks. The big-nosed young man barely managed to block a few more moves before he was smacked on the head by Lu Ming’s spear and killed.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the big-nosed young man’s storage ring. In a flash, Lu Ming dashed toward the ruins on the mountain peak.</p><p>This ruin had collapsed for many years. It was conceivable that in the long past, this mountain must have been covered with a big formation. Otherwise, it was impossible for the ruins to still exist after such a long time. It was likely that the sea had changed into mulberry fields, and nothing was left.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and was slightly disappointed as he did not find anything.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He rose into the air and left the place.</p><p>Lu Ming did not have any gains for the next day.</p><p>“Eh? That’s …”</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming was flying when he suddenly felt something unusual in front of him.</p><p>In front of him, he could feel a faint pressure.</p><p>In star-moon ancient city, he couldn’t let go of any abnormalities.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had a discovery.</p><p>In the wide area in front, there was actually a statue standing there.</p><p>The statue was huge, at least a hundred miles tall, standing in the clouds.</p><p>However, the statue was headless and only had the lower half of its body. It stood on the ground, and the pressure was coming from it.</p><p>Moreover, the closer he got to the statue, the greater the pressure became. It pressed down on Lu Ming’s body, making it more difficult for him to circulate the divine energy in his body. It was as if he was carrying a thousand-pound chain.</p><p>Lu Ming saw a few other figures around the statue.</p><p>Some people were approaching the statue, while others were standing still. Their bodies were trembling slightly, as if they were resisting the pressure of the statue.</p><p>“He’s using the pressure from the statue to Polish his Foundation!”</p><p>Lu Ming could guess the intention of those people at once. His eyes lit up.</p><p>Back then, on Magic City mountain, in order to resist the great formation set up by the three great demon masters and more than 2500 Magic City guards, he had forcibly absorbed the energy of the star core to break through to the next realm.</p><p>Even though he had successfully broken into the fourth level celestial deity realm, it also brought him hidden dangers. That was, his Foundation was unstable.</p><p>If his Foundation was not stable, even if the divine power in his body was full, it would be difficult for him to break through to the next realm. He would have to spend a lot of time to Polish his Foundation.</p><p>This statue was exuding a terrifying pressure. Lu Ming could make use of this pressure to Polish his Foundation.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and landed a thousand miles away from the statue. Then, he stepped forward and walked toward the statue.</p><p>As Lu Ming got closer to the statue, the pressure he felt increased. It was as if he was carrying a divine mountain on his back.</p><p>It was the same for his Shen power. It was getting harder and harder to circulate.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was elated. He needed this kind of pressure, the kind of pressure that would affect the divine power.</p><p>“However, the pressure is not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and kept walking forward.</p><p>Soon, he had surpassed the two young men.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
