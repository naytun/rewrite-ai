No matter how hard ice immortal attacked, the golden sword could always block him.</p><p>Jin Xing was attacking the red flame demon pine with all his strength.</p><p>The Golden Palm print pressed down, and the red flame demonic pine retreated.</p><p>Jin Xing’s strength was truly astonishing. They were both sixth level celestial deities, but he was stronger than the absolute Sword. No wonder he dared to challenge the Scarlet Flame demonic pine and the ice immortal at the same time.</p><p>The red flame demon pine roared and exerted its strength to the extreme, but it was still no match for Jin Xing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Jin Xing’s figure rapidly approached the red flame demonic pine, and his Golden Palm once again chopped down.</p><p>The terrifying power made the pupils of the red flame magic pine contract sharply.</p><p>He roared in anger and threw two punches forward with lava wrapped around his fists.</p><p>However, the moment his fist collided with Jin Xing’s palm, his fist exploded.</p><p>The red flame demon pine screamed and retreated.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Jin Xing was like a golden stream of light. He approached quickly and hit the chest of the red flame demonic pine with his palm.</p><p>The red flame magic pine screamed again. The defense of the ancient God Body couldn’t resist Jin Xing’s attack at all. A big hole was blown out of its chest, and it was sent flying out of the fighting ring.</p><p>When he flew out of the fighting ring, the red flame magic pine’s body had returned to its normal size. It fell heavily out of the fighting ring and coughed up blood.</p><p>Everyone saw that there was a big hole in the chest of the red flame magic pine. The flesh and blood had disappeared, and it was a terrible sight.</p><p>The red flame demon pine quickly took out a healing elixir and took it to heal its injuries.</p><p>In this way, only ice fairy was left on the fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After defeating the red flame demon pine, Jin Xing turned around and attacked the ice immortal.</p><p>Ice immortal’s expression changed and she retreated, not daring to confront Jin Xing.</p><p>“Ten thousand miles of ice!”</p><p>Ice immortal waved her palm several times in a row, turning the fighting ring into a frozen world.</p><p>He planned to use the swimming method to fight with Jin Xing, and then look for an opportunity to see if he could win.</p><p>you want to use this method to fight me? you’re really stupid. Void severing palm imprint!</p><p>die! Jin Xing shouted, and his body was filled with brilliant golden divine light. In the sky, a Golden Palm print was formed. It was extremely huge, covering the entire fighting ring and pressing down.</p><p>In this way, no matter what, ice immortal would be covered by the palm print. No matter what, he had to fight with the other party.</p><p>Ice immortal had no choice but to use all her strength to block the palm print.</p><p>Facing Jin Xing alone, he was even less of a match. In the end, his result was the same as the red flame demonic pine. He was sent flying out of the battle stage and was seriously injured.</p><p>Jin Xing defeated the ice immortal and the red flame demon pine.</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, many people’s faces were pale.</p><p>He was defeated!</p><p>The Qin heaven Starfield had been defeated. Ice fairy, red flame demonic pine, sword Dao Wuji, mo jiuye, and grayflame Army breaker, the five great deity level characters, had been defeated one after another.</p><p>There was no longer any suspense in this battle.</p><p>It seemed like he could not buy any more time.</p><p>sigh, there’s only ten years left? if we can’t find the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s treasure in ten years, when the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s Army arrives, all the forces in the Qin heaven Starfield will be annihilated!</p><p>who on earth stole the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Many people roared in their hearts. In their eyes, this competition had ended with the defeat of ice immortal and red flame demon pine.</p><p>although there are a few geniuses in the Qin heaven Starfield, they can’t even withstand a single blow. Therefore, you only have ten years. After ten years, if you can’t hand over the treasures, you can just wait to be destroyed!</p><p>Jin Xing coldly said.</p><p>the competition isn’t over yet. It’s still too early for you to make a conclusion!</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard.</p><p>The person who spoke was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people’s gazes turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t tell me he still wants to go up and compete?”</p><p>“Although we still have five people left, ice immortal and red flame demon pine have both been defeated. What’s the use of the remaining five people? The defeat is set.”</p><p>Many people shook their heads and sighed.</p><p>young man, forget it. Let’s admit defeat for this match. Why bring disgrace upon ourselves? ”</p><p>One of the elders advised Lu Ming.</p><p>He had good intentions. There was no rule against killing in this competition. If the difference in strength was too great, it would be a great injustice if he was killed by a palm strike.</p><p>“I didn’t, but I’m not willing to accept it.”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward towards the fighting ring. He landed on the fighting ring and stood opposite Jin Xing.</p><p>“You, want to fight me?”</p><p>Jin Xing was also stunned. His eyes flashed with golden light and he could see Lu Ming’s cultivation clearly.</p><p>Third level celestial deity!</p><p>A third level celestial deity actually wanted to exchange blows with him. It was truly a gargantuan joke.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity geniuses like ice immortal and Scarlet Flame demon pine were not his match. What use could a third level celestial deity have?</p><p>Even if the divine power he controlled was divine-grade divine power, he could kill it with one finger.</p><p>ten years is too short. We won’t be able to find the treasure you want. So, we can only take a risk and fight for a thousand years!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“However, you might have to pay with your life for this.”</p><p>Jin Xing said.</p><p>“Of course I know, but I’m afraid you’re still not strong enough to take my life!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, looking very confident.</p><p>This made many people in the Qin heaven Starfield curl their lips.</p><p>Lu Ming was too confident.</p><p>With Jin Xing’s terrifying strength, he was still a little short of taking his life.</p><p>I’m afraid that one move would be enough to crush him into pieces!</p><p>this kid waited until now and he actually wants to fight with Jin Xing. He really doesn’t know what’s good for him!</p><p>Qin wuyou mocked from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s side.</p><p>He initially thought that Lu Ming was hiding and would not dare to attack. He did not expect that he would come out to attack now. In his opinion, it was not that he was cowardly but that he was stupid.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang, Yue Linglong, and the others clenched their fists tightly.</p><p>Although they knew that Lu Ming was very powerful, the strength that Jin Xing had just displayed was too terrifying. Could Lu Ming really fight Jin Xing?</p><p>In their hearts, they were not confident.</p><p>“Young master will definitely win!”</p><p>Only Qiu Yue had full confidence in Lu Ming.</p><p>She had seen Lu Ming’s rise. Along the way, Lu Ming had created too many miracles. She always believed that Lu Ming would not lose.</p><p>is that so? you’re very confident. I hope you have the right to be confident!</p><p>Jin Xing sneered. His body emitted a golden light as he prepared to attack.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>stop! at this moment, Lu Ming shouted. Jin Xing was about to take a step forward, but he stopped in his tracks and almost could not catch his breath.</p><p>“What is this kid trying to do?”</p><p>Many people looked at each other.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Jin Xing gritted his teeth and asked.</p><p>“I don’t want to fight with you now. What’s that thing called again? by the way, Qin wuyou, that Qin wuyou, didn’t you want to fight with me? Come, I’ll give you a chance to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Qin wuyou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
