If they could not awaken the origin factor, then continuing to cultivate would be meaningless. It would just be a waste of time.</p><p>it seems that I have to find a chance to find a divine-grade divine skill with similar attributes to the divine power and cultivate it. Then, I can merge the divine fire into the divine-grade divine Power’s divine fire!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>As long as one cultivated divine-grade divine power with similar attributes, one could fuse with those divine-grade, King-grade, and ordinary divine power.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming could disperse it himself. However, it would be a waste. Lu Ming had spent a lot of effort to cultivate each divine energy.</p><p>the starry sky Camp is the gathering place for the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. There should be no lack of divine-grade divine arts and techniques, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>Even a place like the Qin heaven Star Domain could offer several divine-grade divine techniques and wondrous Arts. The nine ultimate Heavenly King Manor definitely did not lack divine-grade divine techniques and wondrous Arts.</p><p>After all, any one of the paragons here could control divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Most of the heaven’s pride experts had relied on divine-grade divine arts and wondrous techniques to cultivate.</p><p>While Lu Ming and Wu Minghe were discussing, the others were also discussing fervently. They looked at Leng Ying with respect.</p><p>Even if Leng Ying had not awakened the origin factor of Shen power, he was close to it. He was invincible among his peers.</p><p>No wonder Xue Dong had lost so badly.</p><p>“Who still wants my courtyard? Hurry up and fight, don’t waste my time!”</p><p>Leng Ying’s gaze swept across the crowd. Many people couldn’t help but lower their heads when they were swept by his sharp gaze.</p><p>No one fought.</p><p>Xue Dong’s strength was definitely at the top among this batch of new members. If even he couldn’t beat him, anyone else would just be looking for a beating.</p><p>“I don’t believe that the people who live up there are all so strong!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, and many people’s eyes lit up again.</p><p>That’s right, maybe they were just unlucky to have chosen a strong person. Not everyone else had the same cultivation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash, a young man arrived in front of another courtyard.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>The owner of the courtyard had long been alerted by the commotion outside. At this moment, he was lazily leaning against the door and asking.</p><p>“Not bad, I’ve taken a fancy to your courtyard!”</p><p>The challenging youth said, the aura of a ninth level celestial deity suffused from his body.</p><p>This was a genius who was not weaker than Xue Dong.</p><p>“Make your move!”</p><p>The lazy-looking young man said lazily.</p><p>“Thunderclap fist!”</p><p>The young man made his move. He waved his fist, and lightning filled the sky. The void trembled, and the power was shocking.</p><p>However, after a few moves, the lightning dispersed and the young man who challenged him followed in Xue Dong’s footsteps and was severely injured.</p><p>He was defeated again!</p><p>so strong. This person’s strength is also very strong. He is also an existence close to awakening the factor of the origin divine power!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The others ‘faces turned pale.</p><p>The second person was also this strong?</p><p>It couldn’t be that all the people living up there were so strong and close to awakening the divine power factor, right?</p><p>If that was the case, no one would be able to succeed in the challenge today.</p><p>“I don’t believe it, continue …”</p><p>Someone growled and continued to challenge people from other courtyards.</p><p>However, it turned out that their guess was right. The geniuses living here were all shockingly powerful. They were all close to awakening the origin divine power factor and had crushed them in a crushing manner.</p><p>In the end, no one continued to challenge.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that we’re going to stay down there forever?”</p><p>“No, I want to go home!”</p><p>There was a wave of wailing at the scene. Of course, it was only for a short while. No one really wanted to go home or quit.</p><p>If they were to withdraw because of such a reason, even if they returned to their respective forces and families, they would most likely be spurned and never be able to stand out.</p><p>sigh, I’d better work hard on my cultivation and try to awaken the divine force factor as soon as possible. Or perhaps I can break through to the half-step Divine King realm as soon as possible. That way, we can kill our way up here!</p><p>“Yup!”</p><p>Many people sighed and finally understood how terrifying the geniuses of the starry sky were.</p><p>Some people wanted to retreat.</p><p>“You, wait!”</p><p>All of a sudden, a cold voice was heard. An aura spread toward Lu Ming and finally landed on Qiu Yue.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The owner of the aura was the first person to be challenged, Leng Ying.</p><p>At this moment, Leng Ying’s eyes were burning with evil fire as he stared at Qiu Yue.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Qiu Yue’s aura exploded, trying to break through Leng Ying’s aura suppression, but she failed.</p><p>“What is this guy trying to do?”</p><p>Some people were moved.</p><p>miss, you don’t have to go down. You can stay in my courtyard. I just happen to be lacking a maidservant!</p><p>Icehawk said indifferently, his voice carrying a hint of command.</p><p>“Who wants to be your maid? dream on!”</p><p>Qiu Yue struggled.</p><p>“You refuse?”</p><p>Icehawk’s eyes gleamed with a sharp light, ” “If you live here, you don’t have to live in that stinky place down there? Also, when I’m free, I’ll guide you in your cultivation. This is a great fortune for you, do you understand?”</p><p>Leng Ying stared at Qiu Yue. As for Lu Ming, Wu Yue, Wu Ming, and the others, he had completely ignored them.</p><p>Many people looked at Qiu Yue with pity.</p><p>The Crown Prince that icehawk was talking about was nothing more than someone who had taken a fancy to Qiu Yue’s beauty and wanted to keep her for his own use.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue was indeed devastatingly beautiful. The other young men were also tempted by her beauty.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and landed in front of Qiu Yue. The ground trembled and Leng Ying’s aura was dispersed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>A murderous glint flashed across Leng Ying’s eyes. He finally turned his gaze to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, you want to meddle in other people’s business?”</p><p>Icehawk said coldly.</p><p>“What busybody? She’s my woman. Tell me, is this a matter of concern?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Your woman?”</p><p>Hearing this, the killing intent in icehawk’s eyes grew even stronger. He said, ” such a beautiful woman actually fell into your hands. What a waste of a heavenly treasure. It makes me very unhappy.</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>then, then I’m going to destroy your eyes …</p><p>die! icehawk shouted coldly. In a flash, he charged at Lu Ming. His two fingers were like two javelins, aiming for Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The divine energy in Lu Ming’s body circulated at full force. At the same time, he triggered the fourfold combat power of the battle formula.</p><p>A long spear silently appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The long spear vibrated and two spear rays burst out.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The spearlight and frigid Eagle’s fingers collided, resulting in two loud bangs. Lu Ming was forced to take a few steps back.</p><p>However, icehawk’s figure also drifted backward.</p><p>“What? He blocked it?”</p><p>At the side, the others were shocked.</p><p>Other than Wu Ming and a few others, the rest found it hard to believe that Lu Ming could actually block Leng Ying’s attack and even force him to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming was merely a fourth level celestial deity.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Leng Ying himself also revealed a shocked expression. He also never expected that a fourth level celestial deity could erupt with such shocking power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
