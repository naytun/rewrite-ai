The formation appeared and blocked all the sword Qi storms. Otherwise, it would have caused a terrible disaster.</p><p>The two of them fought for a while before suddenly stopping and the two figures flew back.</p><p>Two figures, one in black and one in white, stood on both sides of the fighting ring with long swords in their hands.</p><p>However, it could be seen that sword Dao Wu Ji’s breathing was a little hurried, while the extinctive sword’s breathing was calm.</p><p>“Could it be that sword Dao Wuji is about to lose?”</p><p>Many people’s hearts sank.</p><p>The power of the sword way of the sword of fatality was indeed shocking. The sword was fast and decisive, like a graceful swan. In the confrontation just now, he had a slight advantage.</p><p>“Is this all you’ve got in the way of the sword? That’s too disappointing. Next, it’s time to decide the winner. Myriad sword domain, God slaying sword!”</p><p>you’re courting death! an indifferent voice came out of the sword of fatality’s mouth. Then, he waved his hand, and the combat sword in his hand floated above his head, vibrating slightly.</p><p>&Nbsp; Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>Waves of strange field energy spread out from the sword of fatality, and countless sword shadows suddenly appeared around his body.</p><p>It really did look like countless swords. In any case, it was impossible to tell how many sword shadows there were at a glance.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>Countless sword shadows stabbed towards sword Dao Wu Ji.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! sword Dao Wu Ji shouted. Sword light bloomed from his hand and slashed at the sword shadows.</p><p>However, the moment he touched it, his expression changed.</p><p>The power of the sword shadows was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Each sword shadow seemed to be the full-power Strike of the absolute Sword. The power of so many sword shadows added up was really amazing.</p><p>As soon as they touched, the sword light of sword Dao Wu Ji was shattered. His body trembled and he retreated quickly, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Several wounds appeared on his body, and blood flowed out.</p><p>what a terrifying secret skill. The combat strength of this extinctive sword is amazing …</p><p>At this moment, ice fairy, red flame demonic pine, and Mo jiuye all exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The combat strength of this extinctive sword was indeed terrifying. It was much stronger than Qin wuyou’s.</p><p>hehe, Absolute sword’s talent is very outstanding even in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. There are not many who can match him in a battle of the same level. In the Qin heaven star region, don’t even think about winning against him in a battle of the same level!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, a young man sneered.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>The absolute sword’s cold voice rang out. He continued to control the sword shadow and attacked the absolute Sword.</p><p>“Ancient God Body …”</p><p>die! sword Dao Wuji roared. His body grew rapidly, turning into an orange-armored ancient God that was a hundred meters tall. The sword in his hand also grew rapidly, and he swept out a sword light as large as a mountain.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of clashing sounds rang out. After the infinite sword way had turned into an ancient God Body, its strength had increased greatly, and it finally jumped away from many sword shadows.</p><p>“This is … Ancient God Body?”</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, a young man exclaimed in surprise, looking very surprised.</p><p>I didn’t expect that someone in the tiny Qin heaven Starfield would actually cultivate an ancient God Body. What a surprise!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, an old man stroked his beard and nodded in surprise.</p><p>I’m surprised, but he’s only an orange-armored ancient God Body. He’s still no match for the sword of fatality!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man said coldly.</p><p>They seemed to have a good understanding of the ancient God Body.</p><p>They did not hide anything in their conversation. Lu Ming and the rest heard everything.</p><p>could it be that there’s someone in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion who has also cultivated the ancient God Body? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he could not help but guess.</p><p>The ancient gods were said to be powerful existences born naturally at the beginning of the universe. At that time, there were quite a number of ancient gods.</p><p>Since they could leave behind descendants and inheritances in the Qin heaven star system, it was extremely possible that there were other ancient gods who had left behind descendants and inheritances in other places.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>Wuji’s sword Dao turned into an ancient God. He waved his long sword and attacked the sword of fatality.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” a mere orange-armored ancient God wants to defeat me? naive!</p><p>The sword of fatality only showed a trace of surprise at the beginning, but it quickly regained its calm. With a wave of its hands, endless sword shadows whistled toward the sword Dao Wuji.</p><p>The endless sword shadows gathered into a long river and rushed toward sword Dao Wu Ji.</p><p>Wuji Kendo was a hundred meters tall. When he wielded his giant sword, he was like a stone pillar in the river, resisting the impact of the river water.</p><p>However, no matter how tough the stone pillar was, it would eventually be washed down under the constant impact of the river water.</p><p>It was just like the boundless sword Dao. At first, he could still resist and even charge forward, but his charging speed became slower and slower. A moment later, not only could he not move forward, he was even retreating.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Countless sword shadows slashed on sword Dao Wu Ji’s body and the orange scales on his body, making clanking sounds and sending sparks in all directions.</p><p>In the end, the scales on sword Dao Wu Ji’s body cracked open, and sword marks appeared, causing blood to flow.</p><p>He could no longer defend himself, and the wounds on his body were getting bigger and bigger.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, Wuji’s body shrank rapidly. He could no longer maintain his ancient God Body and returned to his normal form. He flew out of the fighting ring and fell heavily off it.</p><p>“Wuji, how are you?”</p><p>Immediately, experts from the eternal sword sect went up to help heal Wuji sword Dao.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the sword of extinction waved his hand and the sword shadows that filled the sky disappeared without a trace. He stood on the fighting ring calmly and looked around.</p><p>“Who is it? let’s fight again!”</p><p>His gaze swept across the red flame demon pine, ice fairy, and Mo jiuye. In his opinion, only these three people from the Qin heaven Starfield could fight him.</p><p>I’ll do it. I’ll try my best to consume his God Power. If I can’t defeat him, you guys go!</p><p>Mo jiuye said to the red flame magic pine and ice fairy.</p><p>The red flame demon pine and ice fairy were both stronger than him, so it was not the time to fight yet.</p><p>With that, mo jiuye rushed up the fighting ring.</p><p>“Sixth level celestial deity, just by relying on your cultivation, you’re similarly not my match!”</p><p>The sword of fatality spoke indifferently. There was no arrogance in his voice, as if he was speaking the truth.</p><p>“Don’t be too full of yourself, we’ll only know after the battle!”</p><p>Mo jiuye said coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After taking a few steps, mo jiuye’s body rapidly expanded, turning into an orange-armored ancient God that was a hundred meters tall.</p><p>Mo jiuye used his full strength the moment he attacked.</p><p>“Eh? It’s the ancient God Body again. I didn’t expect that there would be more than one person in the Qin heaven Starfield who has cultivated the ancient God Body!”</p><p>Someone from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was shocked.</p><p>it seems that an ancient God World has appeared in the Qin heaven star region. With the appearance of the ancient God’s inheritance, there will be a situation where many people have cultivated the ancient God Body. In a remote star region, it is considered rare to have such an opportunity!</p><p>An old man from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
