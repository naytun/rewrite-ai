They found it hard to accept this fact.</p><p>Before the battle, they were full of confidence, thinking that this was a competition without any suspense, and that they could not lose at all.</p><p>Therefore, they agreed to Lu Ming and the rest’s condition of extending the time limit by a thousand years.</p><p>Their goal was nothing more than to humiliate Lu Ming and the others and put pressure on the Qin heaven Star Zone. They wanted to let the people of the Qin heaven Star Zone know that the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was not something they could fight against.</p><p>It could also make the thief apprehensive and hand over the treasure obediently.</p><p>In the beginning, the plot was indeed similar to what they had imagined. When the absolute Sword and Jin Xing appeared, they practically crushed the Qin heaven Starfield’s geniuses with a sweeping attitude.</p><p>However, they had never expected a Dark Horse to appear.</p><p>Lu Ming had displayed abilities that even they were shocked by and had swept them in the opposite direction, causing them to taste defeat.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming raised his hand and the entire place gradually quieted down.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the ancient God tactic. His body began to shrink and he transformed into a human.</p><p>now, you’ve lost. It’s time to fulfill the conditions you’ve agreed to!</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>The other people from the Qin heaven Starfield also looked at the people from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion with bright eyes.</p><p>Jin Xing, Wei Dao, and the others had unsightly expressions.</p><p>They wanted to deny it, but they had said it in public. They were the pride of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It was really embarrassing to deny it.</p><p>Therefore, they didn’t know how to answer him.</p><p>“What’s wrong? The dignified nine absolute Heavenly King mansion wouldn’t go back on their words, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice rang out. He placed the blame on the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion so that they could not deny it even if they wanted to.</p><p>how can we go back on our words? alright, I’ll promise you today. I’ll give you the Qin heaven star region a thousand years. After a thousand years, if you still can’t hand over the nine absolute divine crystal, the Army of my nine absolute Heavenly King mansion will definitely arrive!</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, a white-haired old man opened his mouth, and his voice spread throughout the entire place.</p><p>“Alright, it’s a deal!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“Remember, you only have a thousand years. Go!”</p><p>The white-haired old man turned around and left after saying this.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll definitely defeat you one day and take revenge for today’s humiliation!”</p><p>Jin Xing’s eyes fell on Lu Ming and he said with fighting spirit.</p><p>“After today’s defeat, I’m afraid you won’t have any more chances in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied, full of confidence.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>Jin Xing said coldly, then turned around and left.</p><p>Very quickly, all the people from the nine Heavens Royal Palace had left.</p><p>The people of the Qin heaven Starfield were all ecstatic.</p><p>This time, he had finally won a thousand years.</p><p>Although a thousand years was nothing to the vast universe, at least he had a chance to catch his breath.</p><p>Lu Ming had won this opportunity.</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of gratitude.</p><p>However, many major forces still felt a sense of urgency.</p><p>A thousand years passed in the blink of an eye. Could they really find the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming went to Ouyang Qingxiang and the others and left the place together. After a while, they returned to Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Not long after, the news spread throughout the Qin heaven star region. The people of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor had indeed all withdrawn from the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>However, the atmosphere in the Qin heaven Starfield did not relax because of this. Instead, it became even more solemn.</p><p>That was because all the major forces in the Qin heaven Starfield were suspicious of each other. They were all guessing who had stolen the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>who exactly stole the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor? quickly hand it over. Are you trying to get everyone killed? ”</p><p>“Which force is so selfish, how hateful!”</p><p>More and more of such voices were heard.</p><p>He guessed that this power had been stolen.</p><p>He guessed that it was stolen by that power.</p><p>There were already conflicts between the major forces of the Qin heaven Starfield. At this time, the conflicts were naturally triggered.</p><p>Some forces even had some friction and showed signs of fighting.</p><p>The red flame clan and the ice Soul Clan were like fire and water.</p><p>The red flame clan said that the ice Soul Clan had stolen the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>However, the ice Soul Clan was not to be outdone. They claimed that the red flame clan had stolen the treasure.</p><p>The two races were already mortal enemies and had deep conflicts. As a result, the fire of conflict between them was completely ignited.</p><p>After a few months, the two races finally started to fight.</p><p>In this battle, even many God King level experts were sent out. Both sides fought fiercely and both sides suffered losses.</p><p>After that, it was a long tug-of-war.</p><p>Both sides had invested a large number of troops in the border Galaxy, and Wars would break out from time to time.</p><p>The atmosphere between the Qin heavenly thirteen clans was extremely tense.</p><p>As for those small forces, everyone was in danger.</p><p>Ten years passed just like that.</p><p>The Qin heaven 13 clans barely managed to maintain a balance. Occasionally, some small conflicts would erupt. However, if this continued, as the 1000-year period drew closer, a war would definitely break out.</p><p>At that time, before the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s Army arrived, the Qin heaven Starfield would be weakened because of internal strife.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming received a message from the ice Soul Clan. They invited him to a gathering.</p><p>Lu Ming was a little confused, but he did not refuse. He rushed to the ice Soul Clan alone.</p><p>brother Lu, long time no see. You’re getting stronger and stronger. You’ve already left me far behind!</p><p>The person who received Lu Ming was the ninth young master of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing.</p><p>Bing Qing laughed at herself when she saw Lu Ming.</p><p>When Lu Ming was fighting Jin Xing, Wei Dao and the rest, bingqing was in seclusion and did not see it. After hearing about it, she was naturally shocked.</p><p>“Brother Bing is too polite. I wonder what is the matter for your noble to call me here this time?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>I heard that it’s about the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Bing Qing’s face turned solemn as she whispered to Lu Ming, as if she was afraid that others would hear her.</p><p>“A treasure from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion? Could it be that there’s news about the nobles?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“I think I’ve found a clue. Lu Ming, my father is waiting for you. Come with me. My father will tell you.”</p><p>Bing Qing said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming was curious.</p><p>If the ice Soul Clan had really found some clues, why did they call him here?</p><p>What did this have to do with him?</p><p>Curious, Lu Ming and bingqing came to a courtyard.</p><p>There was a table in the courtyard, and there were only two people sitting at the table.</p><p>One of them was Bing Qing’s father, the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The other person was the number one genius of the ice Soul Clan, Bing Qing’s seventh brother, Bing Xian.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re here!”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming, the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan and the ice immortal all smiled and stood up to welcome him.</p><p>“I’m lu Ming. Greetings, clan leader Bing!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists courteously and then greeted the ice deity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
