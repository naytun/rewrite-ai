They had come to the right place.</p><p>The two of them couldn’t help but get closer to the star core fragment, and finally saw the full appearance of the fragment.</p><p>It was a crystal the size of a fingernail. Although it was small, the energy it contained was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“It’s so small …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Kid, what do you know? A star core is the core of a star. It contains an enormous amount of energy, but it’s also extremely pure. It’s very easy to absorb and is a peerless treasure!”</p><p>“Moreover, the star core here was formed by a man using a large formation. The energy contained in a star core is even more terrifying. Don’t underestimate this small piece, it’s enough for you to break through to the heavenly God Realm.”</p><p>The disdainful voice of the Liang character formula sounded.</p><p>“Then let’s start!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He could not wait any longer.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang walked toward the star core fragment. When they arrived at the fragment, the two of them sat cross-legged and began to cultivate by absorbing the energy from the star core.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll help you absorb it. It’ll help you break through to the celestial God-level faster!”</p><p>He recited the ” measure ” formula. Then, a powerful suction force erupted. The energy in the star core surged towards Lu Ming continuously and was absorbed by the ” measure ” formula. It was transformed into purer energy and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the universe thousand Dao mantra at full force to absorb and refine this energy.</p><p>The energy of the star core was extremely pure. Even without the ” measure ” formula, it could be refined quickly. With the help of the ” measure ” formula, the refining speed was naturally faster.</p><p>A steady stream of energy was transformed into divine power. Lu Ming’s divine power was increasing rapidly.</p><p>In his dantian, six divine flames were burning fiercely, and the flames were getting more and more vigorous.</p><p>Lu Ming was breaking through to the celestial God-level at an alarming speed.</p><p>On the other side, Ouyang Qingxiang was also circulating her cultivation technique to absorb the energy of the star core fragment. However, her absorption speed was far from comparable to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Just like that, they cultivated for seven days.</p><p>In seven days, the fingernail-sized fragment had almost been completely absorbed by the two of them, leaving only the size of a speck of dust.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, a powerful aura erupted from Ouyang Xiangxiang’s body.</p><p>She had broken through and reached the sixth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>Ouyang Xiangxiang had only broken through to the fifth-level heavenly God Realm not long ago, but she had already reached the sixth-level heavenly God Realm. This was all thanks to the star core fragment.</p><p>However, the energy that Ouyang Qingxiang absorbed was far less than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s aura had also increased to its peak. Six types of divine powers surged and shone with a dazzling light, circulating continuously on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a volcano that was about to erupt at any moment.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming exploded. A shocking aura erupted from his body, and a powerful pressure filled the air.</p><p>This was the pressure of a heavenly God.</p><p>The divine energy that Lu Ming controlled was divine-grade divine energy. He also had five other types of divine energy. The energy required for a breakthrough was much more than Ouyang Qingxiang’s. At this moment, after absorbing the energy of the star core fragment, Lu Ming finally broke through the bottleneck in one fell swoop and charged into the celestial God Realm.</p><p>As soon as he entered the celestial God Realm, Lu Ming’s body exuded a powerful suction force. The energy between heaven and earth rushed towards Lu Ming in an even more violent manner.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The last star core fragment let out a soft sound and completely shattered. It turned into energy and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The moment the star core fragment shattered, the huge birds around the canyon screeched and dispersed. They turned into energy and surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>With four empty eyes, Zhuo bumu and the others had been waiting outside the canyon, waiting for Lu Ming to come out and kill him.</p><p>At this moment, they suddenly saw the giant birds scattering one by one, and they were all shocked.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“That’s Lu Ming. He’s cultivating!”</p><p>damn it, it must be the star core fragment. Lu Ming absorbed the star core fragment, which caused all those big birds to disperse. Kill, kill him!</p><p>When four-eyed void court and the rest saw Lu Ming and Ouyang Xiangxiang, they could easily guess what had happened. They immediately roared angrily, their eyes red with envy, jealousy, and hatred.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Zhuo buhua was the most direct. With a cold shout, a terrifying sword intent burst out. He became one with the sword, turning into a brilliant sword light and slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually absorbed the star core fragment. He wanted to crush Lu Ming’s bones and scatter his ashes.</p><p>The sword light was extremely fast and it was approaching Lu Ming in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming was at the critical moment of his breakthrough and he could not resist at all.</p><p>In actual fact, the current situation was beyond Lu Ming’s expectations. He did not expect that after he absorbed the star core fragment, the huge birds would disperse.</p><p>“Green Lotus sword domain!”</p><p>die! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted. Her delicate body emitted a dazzling green sword radiance. Green Lotus flowers appeared in front of Lu Ming. Thousands of sword Qi slashed at Zhuo Buzhu.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Qi clashed. In an instant, the sword Qi from both sides had clashed hundreds of times.</p><p>After a few hundred hits, the green Lotus flower crumbled, and Zhuo Buzhu’s figure was also blocked and stopped.</p><p>“You’ve made a breakthrough in your cultivation!”</p><p>Zhuo bingchen’s expression was unsightly as he stared at Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>it must be a star core fragment. She has also absorbed the energy of a star core fragment. Damn it, damn it!</p><p>The four-eyed King Kong charged over, his mouth constantly roaring in anger. He was so jealous that he was about to go crazy.</p><p>In his opinion, Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang’s absorption of the star core fragment was simply a waste of a heavenly treasure.</p><p>How great would it be if he could absorb the star core fragment? he would definitely be able to break through to the seventh level or even the eighth level of the heavenly deity realm. In that case, he would not have to fear mo jiuye. He could even suppress mo jiuye and become the number one expert among the younger generation of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>However, this hope had been shattered by Lu Ming and Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“So what if I’ve broken through? Kill!”</p><p>Zhuo Wudi shouted, and the sword light became even brighter as it charged toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Let’s attack together and get rid of this b * tch. Then, we’ll kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The four-eye void court roared and attacked as well. Terrifying beams of light shot out from its four eyes and shot toward Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>“Green Lotus sword domain ~”</p><p>Green Lotus sword domain! Ouyang Qingxiang shouted again. The divine power in her body was about to burn. She burst out with all her power and set up the green Lotus sword domain around Lu Ming and her.</p><p>The boundless sword Qi gathered into a few huge Green Lotus flowers, which enveloped the two of them and blocked the attacks from all directions.</p><p>However, Ouyang Xiangxiang’s cultivation had only just broken through to the sixth level heavenly deity realm. She wouldn’t even be a match for four eyes void court or Zhuo Bufu alone, let alone the two of them working together.</p><p>The moment the two attacks collided, the green Lotus trembled violently. Ouyang Qingxiang groaned and her body trembled. She spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent flying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
