Those who were caught by his gaze were all frightened and broke out in cold sweat. They did not dare to look him in the eye.</p><p>Even some of the Godking experts in the Kong Xuan sect were the same.</p><p>The Dean of the Yimo Academy was a true Overlord figure in the Qin Tian star region. He was an existence that stood at the peak. Ordinary godkings were far from being his match.</p><p>In the entire Kong Xuan sect, only the Dragon Boat Mountain could compete with the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>This was also the reason why the Kong Xuan sect could become the head of the top ten sects. It was because the other sect Masters of the top ten sects could not compete with the Dean of the Yimo Academy.</p><p>Now that the Dragon Boat Mountain was not around, how could the others dare to face an Overlord like the Dean of the unique demon Academy?</p><p>“Where’s Dragon Boat Mountain? get him to come out!”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief coldly shouted.</p><p>“Senior, Overlord long, we don’t know where he is now.”</p><p>An elder of the Kong Xuan sect replied.</p><p>“I wonder where he is? Did he think that hiding would be of any use? I’ll destroy the Kong Xuan sect and see where he can hide.”</p><p>The college chief of the unique devil Academy said coldly. His voice contained endless killing intent.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Everyone in Kong Xuan sect was shocked.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The college chief of the unique devil Academy made his move. With a wave of his hand, an extremely huge demonic palm formed and pressed down on Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>The demonic palm was simply too big, and it completely enveloped the most important inner and outer sects of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>If this palm were to press down, the main gate of Kong Xuan sect would probably be razed to the ground.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>“Let’s join hands!”</p><p>Angry voices came from within the Kong Xuan sect. Then, nine figures rushed into the sky.</p><p>They were the nine founding elders of the Kong Xuan sect. They were all divine kings. They attacked together and each of them used their ultimate moves. Nine brilliant attacks crashed toward the demonic palm in the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Nine terrifying collisions were produced. The sky and the earth were both shaking violently.</p><p>Finally, the demonic palm was blocked and dispersed in the air. However, the nine elders of the Kong Xuan sect grunted and their bodies trembled violently. They fell toward the main gate of the Kong Xuan sect and crashed heavily into the ground.</p><p>Some of the weaker cultivators spat out a mouthful of blood and their faces turned pale.</p><p>After all, there was still a huge gap between them and the college chief of the unique devil Academy. Although they had blocked a move from the other party, they had also been injured.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see how many of my moves you can block!”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief shouted coldly. A demonic sword flew out of his body. He held it in his hand, and a terrifying sword intent spread.</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect was filled with despair.</p><p>If the demonic Academy’s Dean were to attack with all his might, the Kong Xuan sect would probably have to mobilize most of their elders in order to fight against him.</p><p>However, one should not forget that there were still other elders in the unique demon Academy.</p><p>There were also experts from the indestructible sword sect and the boundless Holy Land.</p><p>If the other party attacked together, the Kong Xuan sect would be annihilated in an instant.</p><p>“We’re finished!”</p><p>Some people’s faces turned pale. Could it be that they were going to die Here today?</p><p>“Dean, my Supreme clan is willing to submit to the unique demon Academy. Please, Dean, spare our lives!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from within the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Then, a person stepped into the air and stood in midair. He then bowed respectfully to the Dean of the unique demon Academy.</p><p>“The Paragon is moving! It’s him!”</p><p>“He actually wants to rely on the unique devil Academy!”</p><p>“Shameless traitor!”</p><p>Many of the Kong Xuan sect members were roaring in their hearts, but they did not dare to curse out loud.</p><p>“Oh? You want to join me?”</p><p>The headmaster of the unique devil Academy said.</p><p>“It’s not me, it’s my Supreme clan. Why aren’t you all coming out?”</p><p>Zhi Zun’s gaze swept across the people from the Zhi Zun clan.</p><p>Instantly, many figures flew out.</p><p>Among them were the Supreme universe and the other Supreme clans. There were many experts and even two elders.</p><p>“Alright, alright, I agree!”</p><p>The Dean of the unique devil Academy directly nodded and agreed.</p><p>This was not a small force, so it would be a waste not to take it.</p><p>thank you, headmaster. From now on, my Supreme clan will follow your lead!</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong hurriedly said.</p><p>Supreme martial artist, move! You traitor! You’re despicable! How dare you betray the Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>At this moment, a furious roar rang out. It was Yue Wuya, and he glared at the Supreme martial artist with a furious expression.</p><p>what shameless? this is called ‘a wise man submits to circumstances’. Yue Wuya, I advise you to surrender. What’s the point of fearlessly resisting? ”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong sneered.</p><p>despicable is despicable. You’re still finding so many excuses for yourself!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya shouted in anger.</p><p>“Supreme martial artist, move! This old man has truly misjudged you in the past!”</p><p>“Your Supreme clan is full of ingrates!”</p><p>The other elders of Kong Xuan sect also roared in anger.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong shouted coldly. His face was extremely gloomy as he said coldly,”A group of stubborn guys, if you want to die, this old man will not accompany you.”</p><p>After saying this much, Supreme martial artist Dong led the members of his Supreme martial clan and flew in the direction of the Dean of the unique demon Academy. Then, they obediently stood beside the Dean like obedient dogs.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s see how you die this time!”</p><p>The universe master stood in the crowd and roared in his heart. His eyes scanned the Kong Xuan sect, trying to find Lu Ming and kill him.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could not find Lu Ming even after looking around.</p><p>“Since you’re not here, the people closest to you must die. Ouyang Qingxiang and those from Lu Ming’s faction …”</p><p>Supreme universe’s gaze swept across Ouyang Qingxiang, an hai, Liu Chang, and the others, revealing a ferocious killing intent.</p><p>who else wants to surrender? if you surrender to the indestructible sword sect, I won’t pursue the matter.</p><p>At this moment, the sect leader of the inextinguishable sword sect stepped out.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect was also a strong force, and they were envious of them.</p><p>“If you join the boundless sacred land, I won’t pursue the matter!”</p><p>The boundless Holy Land’s Lord spoke.</p><p>In the Kong Xuan sect, the eyes of some people flickered.</p><p>Some people were tempted.</p><p>If they insisted on going against the major forces, only death would await them. If they surrendered, they would still have a chance to live.</p><p>They had cultivated for so many years and had extremely long lifespans. Once they reached the martial immortal realm, they could live for a star year. Who would be willing to be killed?</p><p>you want us to be traitors? don’t even think about it. Once we become traitors, we’ll have to bear the infamy of eternity. Not only ourselves, but our future generations will also be unable to lift their heads. We’re definitely not traitors. You can give up on this idea!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya roared in anger.</p><p>These words made the faces of some of the Supreme clan members turn red with shame, and some of the people who had wanted to surrender began to hesitate.</p><p>Yes, once they betrayed, they would have to bear a lifetime of infamy. Others would not dare to say it in front of them, but they would definitely point fingers behind their backs.</p><p>“Since you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The eyes of the demonic Academy’s College chief turned cold as he looked at Yue Wuya. Then, he slashed his demonic sword at Yue Wuya.</p><p>This sword was extremely powerful. Yue Wuya’s expression was extremely serious. He used all his strength to attack, wanting to block this sword.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
