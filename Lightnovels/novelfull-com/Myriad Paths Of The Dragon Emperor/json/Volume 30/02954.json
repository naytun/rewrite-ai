Coupled with the talent that she had displayed in the past few years, it was possible that her cultivation would soar and her reputation would spread far and wide.</p><p>Lu Ming was listening at the side and was not in a hurry to make a move.</p><p>“Rose, you too!”</p><p>Night Devil King said to night rose.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Night rose nodded. She took a step forward and charged towards a fighting ring.</p><p>“Miss Rose, you’re going to help too? I won’t show any mercy!”</p><p>miss qiangwei, you should go down by yourself. I can’t bear to attack a beauty like you!</p><p>The young men teased.</p><p>However, in the next moment, they could no longer laugh, because they would be left on the fighting stage forever.</p><p>Because night rose had made her move. She stretched out her scallion-like fingers and pointed out continuously. The finger forces were extremely terrifying and directly killed the youths who were teasing her.</p><p>The others gasped and retreated.</p><p>The terrifying strength that night rose displayed shocked many people.</p><p>The Sorcerer’s blood, the burly young man with the saber, and the others all looked surprised. They did not expect the strength of the night rose to be so shocking.</p><p>“It’s almost time to make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and walked towards one of the fighting rings.</p><p>There weren’t any strong experts on this fighting ring.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming landed on the fighting ring, someone had his eyes on him.</p><p>a third level celestial deity also dares to come up. Courting death, kill!</p><p>A skinny young man shouted coldly and slashed his sword at Lu Ming.</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s palm without a sound.</p><p>“Break the air …”</p><p>With a thought, the Spear’s light burst out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The skinny young man’s forehead was pierced through and he died on the spot.</p><p>However, the killing of one person did not cause the others to be alarmed. Instead, a few young men charged towards Lu Ming together.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming shook the long spear and a few more spearlights burst out immediately. Then, these few young men were left in the fighting ring forever.</p><p>As a result, it attracted the attention of the other young men who were fighting on the fighting stage.</p><p>“This brat is a pain in the ass. Let’s join forces and kill him!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s kill him together!”</p><p>At that moment, at least dozens of other young men on the fighting ring charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. His divine power surged wildly and his long spear danced.</p><p>The spear radiance was as huge as a mountain range and swept in all directions.</p><p>As the spear radiance crushed over, miserable cries sounded out. In an instant, more than ten youths were killed.</p><p>On the fighting ring, the other people’s faces changed drastically. They were frightened and retreated hurriedly, not daring to get close to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get off the fighting stage!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his aura was wild.</p><p>However, while some of the young men rushed down the fighting ring, some of them stood at the edge of the ring, unwilling to give up.</p><p>At this moment, many of the battle platforms were occupied by terrifying geniuses. If they went down, they wouldn’t have a share in the other battle platforms.</p><p>“If you don’t get lost, you’ll die!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took a step forward. The fighting ring rumbled and exploded. Lu Ming rushed out, his long spear shaking and a spear ray pierced through.</p><p>A few more screams were heard, and a few young men were killed.</p><p>Seeing this, the remaining young men did not dare to stay any longer and rushed down the fighting ring in a hurry.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one left on the fighting ring.</p><p>At this moment, more than half of the 32 fighting platforms had finished their battles. There was a powerful genius on each fighting platform.</p><p>“Kid, you have some strength. Haha, that’s good!”</p><p>At that moment, Wu Xue looked at Lu Ming and laughed with a ferocious look in his eyes.</p><p>Since Lu Ming had advanced, he would have the chance to kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered with this person and directly ignored him.</p><p>Being ignored by Lu Ming, the Sorcerer’s blood’s face turned gloomy and murderous intent filled the air.</p><p>The other fighting rings were still fighting, but soon, the outcome was also decided.</p><p>All 32 fighting rings had been occupied.</p><p>so many foreign heaven’s favorites. Out of the 32 seats, my Magic City mountain only occupied two!</p><p>that’s right. At least half of them aren’t heaven’s favorites from the chutian star field. I’ve never heard of them before!</p><p>he’s definitely from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>On Magic City mountain, many people were discussing.</p><p>The night Demon Lord also looked pensive. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>alright, now that the top 32 have been determined, we will now proceed with the one-on-one duels. The duels will be conducted by drawing lots!</p><p>&Nbsp; the night Demon King’s voice rang out. Then, with a wave of his hand, the 32 battle platforms in the air began to dance and fly to both sides. Then, another battle platform flew out of the night Demon King’s sleeve.</p><p>This fighting ring was much larger than all the previous fighting rings. It was suspended in the air and would be the main fighting ring for the next battle.</p><p>Then, it was time to draw lots.</p><p>Every fighting ring that Lu Ming and the rest occupied had a number.</p><p>From number one to number thirty-two.</p><p>For example, the fighting ring that Lu Ming occupied was No. 16.</p><p>The night Demon Lord would draw lots. The two numbers he drew would be used to fight.</p><p>“Number 16, number 28!”</p><p>Night Demon Lord announced after drawing his lot.</p><p>“I’ll be the first one!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and flew up to the main fighting ring.</p><p>However, when he flew up to the main fighting ring, he was stunned.</p><p>His opponent was the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm.</p><p>“Hmph, I admit defeat!”</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm could only admit that she was unlucky when she saw Lu Ming.</p><p>She had already fought with Lu Ming and knew that she was no match for him. She might as well admit defeat.</p><p>“Eh? I admit defeat!”</p><p>Some people were surprised that the woman with the snake on her arm had admitted defeat.</p><p>After all, the woman with the snake wrapped around her arm was a sixth level heavenly deity at the divine Son level.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only a third-level celestial deity. The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm had actually surrendered without a fight.</p><p>“It seems that this kid can’t be underestimated!”</p><p>“Perhaps he has some terrifying means!”</p><p>The paragons in the other fighting rings thought to themselves and could not help but size Lu Ming up.</p><p>The woman with the snake wrapped around her arm rushed down the fighting ring and admitted defeat. The night Demon King then kept her fighting ring.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to the No. 16 Coliseum.</p><p>Then, the competition continued.</p><p>For example, the burly youth with the saber and the black-robed youth with the spear were both extremely powerful and easily defeated their opponents.</p><p>In addition, the wizard blood and the night rose were also very powerful, and they crushed their opponents.</p><p>Of course, there were also some who were on par with each other, and the battle was very intense.</p><p>There were even people who had to fight for thousands of moves before the victor was decided.</p><p>After a few days, the first round ended, and the top 16 were born.</p><p>Then, the second round began.</p><p>The second round was the same as the first round. It was decided by drawing lots.</p><p>Many people were nervous and looking forward to it.</p><p>As long as they passed the second round, they would be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>Entering the top ten would give him a Jin of demon night spring. This was a huge harvest.</p><p>“Number 16 against number 11!”</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
