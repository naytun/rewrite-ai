He walked up the stairs and went up to the second floor.</p><p>On the second floor, there were some secret manuals of divine skills!</p><p>However, there was a restriction placed on each of the secret manuals. Lu Ming picked one up and flipped through it. He realized that he could only flip through the first two pages, which contained a simple introduction of the skill. As for the specific content, he could not flip through it no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>If one wanted to read the rest of the content, one could only buy it and Ask the Expert guarding the place to open the restriction for them.</p><p>“Let’s see if I can find a suitable speed-type godly skill!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly had an idea.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique that he cultivated was incomplete, and the highest level he could reach was the seventh level. Now that he had cultivated it to the peak, he wanted to find a speed-type divine skill that could cultivate to a higher level.</p><p>As for the offensive and defensive divine skills, there were a total of nine levels in the three apocalyptic strikes and the ninefold Crimson Gold armor. It was enough for Lu Ming to cultivate for a period of time.</p><p>Ordinary cultivators could only reach the ninth level of the divine skill after reaching the divine King realm. Therefore, it was not easy to reach the ninth level.</p><p>He didn’t need to change these two for the time being.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around the second floor and scanned the room. Not long after, his eyes lit up.</p><p>“Nine heavenly kun Peng technique, there’s actually a nine heavenly kun Peng technique here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He saw a speed-type divine skill, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly picked it up and flipped through it.</p><p>Of course, he could only flip to the first two pages, which introduced the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>the thirteenth level. This is the complete nine heavenly kun Peng technique. It can be cultivated to the thirteenth level!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Needless to say, Lu Ming was definitely going to buy this nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>If he were to purchase other speed-type divine skills, Lu Ming would have to start from the first level. However, he could start from the seventh level when he cultivated the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the nine heavenly kun Peng technique manual and felt satisfied. He then walked to the third floor.</p><p>On the third floor, there were all kinds of divine techniques.</p><p>Moreover, they were all divine-grade divine skills and techniques. When cultivated to the peak, one could cultivate divine-grade divine power.</p><p>There were hundreds of them!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>There were more than a hundred divine-grade divine arts and techniques, and each of them could cultivate a different divine-grade divine energy. This made Lu Ming’s heart beat faster.</p><p>He had the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture and could cultivate many types of divine power. If he could successfully cultivate all these divine techniques, then wouldn’t he be able to control hundreds of divine-grade divine power?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with greed.</p><p>“Calm down, calm down …”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p>In the past, he really wanted to cultivate so many types of divine-grade divine power. However, he had changed his mind now.</p><p>Every kind of divine-grade divine power had endless potential and could continuously awaken the origin divine power factor. Thus, while he could cultivate many kinds of divine power, he did not have that much energy to awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Therefore, he did not plan to cultivate too many types for the time being. He only wanted to cultivate divine power that was similar to the divine and King grade divine power in his body.</p><p>When he had the chance in the future, he would cultivate more Shen power.</p><p>After calming down, Lu Ming began to search.</p><p>Now, he had ten types of Shen power in his body.</p><p>They were three king grade divine powers. They were the ice divine power cultivated from the ice divine technique, the great sun divine power cultivated from the great sun divine technique, and the Golden Dragon divine power cultivated from the Golden Dragon divine technique.</p><p>The other five types of divine power were the extreme cold divine power cultivated from the extreme cold divine technique, the extreme mysterious divine power cultivated from the extreme mysterious divine technique, the multi-eye divine power cultivated from the multi-eye divine technique, the sky wind divine power cultivated from the sky wind divine technique, and the nine evil divine power cultivated from the nine evil divine technique.</p><p>The last two types were divine-grade divine power, which was hegemon-level divine power and inextinguishable swordforce.</p><p>Among these divine powers, the ice divine power and the ultimate cold divine power had similar attributes. As long as he found a divine grade divine skill of the cold attribute and successfully cultivated it, he could merge them.</p><p>As for the other King grade divine powers and sacred grade divine powers, he had to find similar divine grade divine skills to cultivate them.</p><p>Lu Ming searched carefully. Not long after, he found two that satisfied him.</p><p>When the &lt; &lt; moon Shen methodology &gt; &gt; was cultivated to its peak, one could cultivate moon Shen power. Its attributes were extremely cold. If one could awaken the origin Shen power factor, one would be even more terrifying. This was an extremely ancient Shen power.</p><p>When the sun Shen methodology was cultivated to its peak, one could cultivate sun Shen power. The attribute was extremely strong and yang. This was also an extremely ancient Shen power that corresponded to the sun Shen power.</p><p>“I’ll take these two!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the two divine techniques. He then continued to search.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming found a few more.</p><p>The annihilating wind divine power cultivated from the “annihilating wind divine technique” was a divine-grade divine power and just happened to correspond to the heavenly wind divine power.</p><p>The heavenly evil divine power cultivated from the heavenly evil divine technique was also a divine-grade divine power, and it corresponded to the nine evil divine power.</p><p>The profound sky divine technique’s profound sky divine power was also a divine-grade divine power, and its attribute was similar to that of the profound sky divine power.</p><p>However, it was a pity that Lu Ming could not find any divine-grade divine arts that corresponded to the Golden Dragon divine power and multi-eye divine power after searching through all the divine arts.</p><p>I’ll buy these five first. I’ll think of a way to buy the other two later!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. After putting away the divine techniques, he headed to the first floor.</p><p>At the entrance.</p><p>“What do you want to buy? Let me warn you first, there are restrictions on the things inside. If I don’t remove the restrictions, you won’t be able to take them out.”</p><p>The old guard reminded.</p><p>“This junior understands. This junior wants to buy these!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out the “nine heavenly kun Peng technique” and the secret manuals of the five divine-grade mystical techniques.</p><p>“You want to buy so many divine-grade divine arts and techniques? Little guy, each person only needs to cultivate one. Don’t you understand?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes widened and he looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>“Senior, you’ve misunderstood. I’m not buying it for myself. I come from a small place and there’s a lack of divine grade techniques there. I’m buying it for my friend,”</p><p>Lu Ming randomly came up with a reason.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>The old man nodded. He didn’t doubt it. It was normal to buy it for his family and friends.</p><p>however, the price of a divine-grade Divine Art is very high. One book is …</p><p>Then, the old man announced the total price of the five wondrous techniques and the nine heavenly kun Peng technique.</p><p>Lu Ming gasped after hearing the price.</p><p>One hundred thousand high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>The total price would be one hundred thousand high-grade divine crystals.</p><p>High grade divine crystals were divine crystals used by godkings to cultivate.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
