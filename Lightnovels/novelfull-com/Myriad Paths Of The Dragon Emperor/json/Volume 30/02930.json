He swept his gaze across Lu Ming and the rest, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>Sixth level celestial deity!</p><p>The horned young man, Xu Huo, was a sixth level heavenly deity. Judging from his aura, the divine power he controlled should be divine grade divine power.</p><p>“I’ll fight you!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard. Then, a sword light flashed, and a young man with a long sword on his back appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>This young man was from the eternal sword sect.</p><p>“Zhuoyue, from the inextinguishable sword sect!”</p><p>The youth with the long sword on his back said. A ray of sword light shot into the sky. In terms of aura, he did not lose to Xu Huo at all. He was also a sixth-level heavenly deity.</p><p>This “outstanding” was no less famous than Zhuo Buzhu in the immortal sword sect. He was also a heaven’s favorite second only to the sword Dao Wuji.</p><p>it looks like you are a sword cultivator. Interesting. Make your move. Let me see what kind of combat power a sword cultivator from the Qin heaven Starfield has!</p><p>Xu Huo licked his lips and his eyes lit up.</p><p>“I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Zhuoyue snorted coldly. The moment he finished speaking, the combat sword on his back was unsheathed at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Many people did not see how he had unsheathed his combat sword. They only saw a sword light, like a flying immortal from beyond the heavens, tear through the air and kill Xu Huo.</p><p>However, Xu Huo was not slow at all.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In his hand, a dazzling white blade light bloomed and slashed forward.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>In the next moment, the two of them clashed. Sword-light and saber-light kept clashing in the air. In a breath’s time, the two of them had exchanged at least a few hundred moves.</p><p>The next moment, the two figures separated at the same time and floated back.</p><p>“Who won?”</p><p>Everyone quickly observed carefully.</p><p>On the surface, the two of them were both sixth level heavenly deities and the divine power they controlled was also divine grade divine power. There shouldn’t be much of a difference in their strength.</p><p>At this moment …</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Zhuoyue’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He used his sword to support his body and barely managed to keep himself from falling.</p><p>“Zhuoyue lost? how is that possible?”</p><p>Many people were shocked. Upon a closer look, they realized that there was a deep knife wound on Zhuo Yue’s chest, almost cutting him in half.</p><p>The terrifying force of the blade continued to drill into Zhuo Yue’s body, forcing him to use all his divine power to resist.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Huo was calm and composed. His breathing was steady, and he was completely fine.</p><p>you’re not bad to be able to survive one of my attacks. However, as a sword cultivator, I’m really disappointed that you only have this little attack power!</p><p>Xu Huo said indifferently. His tone was filled with disdain.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Zhuoyue spat out another mouthful of blood. His eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>As a sword cultivator, he was originally known for his strong attack power.</p><p>However, in the collision just now, he was completely at a disadvantage and was no match for his opponent.</p><p>One had to know that they were of the same level. The divine power that Xu Huo controlled was only divine-grade divine power and not divine-grade divine power. This was something that he found difficult to accept.</p><p>“This Xu Huo’s control of divine power is too strong. Whether it’s his divine skills or secret Arts, they’re all shockingly powerful.”</p><p>Ice immortal said with a serious expression.</p><p>as expected of a heaven’s favorite from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. His use of divine power is really amazing.</p><p>Mo jiuye spoke as well, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p>Even though the strength of Shen power was the same, the difference in the use of it would result in a world of difference in power.</p><p>For example, if an ordinary person had the same strength of 50 kilograms, he would only use brute force to attack randomly. However, a martial arts expert could accurately use this 50 kilograms of strength and explode with several times the power. Naturally, there was a huge difference in combat power.</p><p>Therefore, Zhuo Yue, who seemed to have the same cultivation level as Xu Huo, was easily defeated.</p><p>“Seeing that you’re able to take one of my attacks without dying, I won’t kill you. Get lost!”</p><p>Xu Huo waved his hand and said.</p><p>“Junior Brother tai, you may leave!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wuji said, and zhuoyue retreated helplessly.</p><p>“Who else, come up and fight!”</p><p>Xu Huo said loudly.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>A young man stepped out from the unique demon Academy and landed on the battle stage.</p><p>This young man was also a peerless genius. Whether it was his divine power level or cultivation, he was an existence on the same level as an outstanding person.</p><p>Unfortunately, this person was no match for Xu Huo. After exchanging dozens of moves, he was severely injured by Xu Huo in one move. He fled from the fighting ring in a panic with a pale face.</p><p>Two consecutive defeats!</p><p>This caused the hearts of everyone in the Qin heaven Starfield to sink.</p><p>The other party had only sent out a sixth level heavenly deity Saint child character. The Qin heaven star region had sent out a character of the same level, but it was a one-sided situation.</p><p>How could they fight like this? could it be that they had to send out a Divine Son level figure at this time?</p><p>This way, the situation would be too passive.</p><p>right now, we can’t attack. Otherwise, we’ll be too passive. Continue to send people up and exhaust his divine power. He’s using his ultimate moves continuously, so his divine power will definitely be consumed very quickly!</p><p>Ice immortal and the others discussed in secret and finally decided to send more Masters.</p><p>Next, the boundless Holy Land sent a genius to fight Xu Huo.</p><p>This time, the Qin heaven Starfield had sent 18 people. Their combat strength was at least at the outstanding level. The three Overlord forces, the ice Soul Clan, and the Scarlet Flame clan could be said to have sent out all their talents.</p><p>This time, the boundless sacred land’s prodigy didn’t go head-to-head with his opponent. Instead, he engaged in a dogfight to exhaust his opponent’s divine power.</p><p>After close to a hundred moves, the boundless sacred land’s genius was finally defeated and sent off the stage.</p><p>Three consecutive defeats!</p><p>The other party had only sent out one heaven’s favorite and had defeated three of their heaven’s favorites in a row.</p><p>If the heaven’s favorites sent out later were all unrivaled existences of the same level, how could they compete?</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, a genius from the ice Soul Clan stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s Paragon froze the entire fighting ring as soon as he made his move. Even the space seemed to be frozen.</p><p>What Xu Huo used was a Swift blade. His attack was fast, and so was his body. He was restrained by the ice Soul clan’s Paragon, so his attack speed was greatly reduced.</p><p>Moreover, he had fought three battles in a row, and his divine power had been greatly consumed. For a moment, he was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>“There’s a chance!”</p><p>This caused the eyes of many people in the Qin heaven Starfield to light up, feeling that there was hope of winning.</p><p>After the ice Soul clan’s Paragon took control of the situation, he launched a storm of attacks, forcing Xu Huo to retreat.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>An ice sword slashed across Xu Huo’s shoulder, causing blood to spurt out.</p><p>“Ice sword Divine Domain, defeat me!”</p><p>The Paragon of the ice Soul Clan used his ultimate move. He condensed hundreds of ice swords, which sealed off the surroundings and flew toward Xu Huo.</p><p>Xu Huo quickly struck out with his saber and destroyed the ice swords.</p><p>However, there were too many ice swords and he couldn’t block all of them.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Finally, an ice sword pierced through Xu Huo’s stomach and brought him out of the fighting ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
