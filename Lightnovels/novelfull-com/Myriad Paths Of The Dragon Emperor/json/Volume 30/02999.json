I’ll definitely find some friends to ask around for lady Qiuyue’s whereabouts!</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>“Thank you, brother Wu!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“By the way, brother Lu, where are you going next?”</p><p>Wu zixiong asked again.</p><p>I’ve heard that there are some forbidden areas in star-moon ancient city. One of them is the land of extreme coldness, and there are extreme cold treasures there. I want to try my luck there!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Go to the forbidden area?”</p><p>Wu zixiong’s expression slightly congealed, saying: brother Lu, some of the forbidden areas in Starmoon ancient city are very dangerous. If you want to go, you must be careful!</p><p>“Thank you, brother Wu. I will be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>brother Lu, keep going north and you’ll find the frigid forbidden land. I have a simple map here. You might need it!</p><p>With that, Wu zixiong took out a map and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“A map?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He opened it and took a look. There were some circuits and some special places that were all marked.</p><p>To the north from here, there was a forbidden area known as the cold nether forbidden area. It was filled with cold nether Qi and was extremely dangerous.</p><p>this map was drawn by the Wu clan’s geniuses when they entered star-Moon City. It’s relatively simple, but it can be used!</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>“You gave me the map, then you guys …”</p><p>Lu Ming hesitated.</p><p>“Haha, we naturally have a backup!”</p><p>Wu zixiong laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming patted his head. He was worried about Qiu Yue and was a little distracted. He was really confused.</p><p>Of course, the woo family had a backup of such a map.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll take my leave then. See you another day!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>“Take care!”</p><p>Wu Ming and the others also cupped their fists.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned and left, heading north.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming found a hidden place. He sat cross-legged and consumed a divine healing pill to start healing.</p><p>Previously, he had taken a blow from the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite and was heavily injured.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming had recovered to his peak state. He then left the place and continued to head north.</p><p>Star-moon ancient city was like a world. It was huge and boundless. Lu Ming flew for a few days before he finally arrived at his destination, the coldnether forbidden grounds.</p><p>The coldnether forbidden ground was filled with the Qi of the cold nether, which was extremely Yin and cold.</p><p>It was said that someone had once obtained a treasure of extreme Yin and extreme cold from the coldnether forbidden grounds.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking for such a treasure to speed up the refinement of the star core and to fill up the five types of divine-grade divine energy in his body as soon as possible. Then, he would break through to the next realm.</p><p>Looking from afar, not even a blade of grass grew in the coldnether forbidden grounds, and there was a gray mist floating in the air.</p><p>This gray mist was the Qi of the cold nether.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a stream of light flew over from not far away.</p><p>The next moment, the light faded and a figure appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was a woman. She was tall and had perfect curves. Her skin was as white as snow and she had a peerless face.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>Even though Lu Ming had seen all kinds of beautiful women, including Xie nianqing and Qiu Yue, he could not help but admire them.</p><p>This woman’s beauty was not inferior to Qiu Yue, Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun, and the others.</p><p>At this moment, the absolute beauty also saw Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s you? You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>The absolute beauty spoke. Her voice was clear and pleasant to the ears, but it was filled with a faint coldness.</p><p>“That’s right, I’m lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>The absolute beauty nodded, and a cold killing intent suddenly emanated from her body.</p><p>“Then go to hell!”</p><p>die! the absolute beauty shouted as she took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming. At the same time, a terrifying sword light burst out from her hand and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“F * ck …”</p><p>Lu Ming cursed. He did not expect that this beautiful woman would suddenly attack him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already on his guard when he sensed the killing intent from the absolute beauty. As soon as she made her move, Lu Ming activated the battle character formula that increased his combat power by four times.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and swept it out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword-light slashed at Lu Ming’s long spear, causing it to shake violently. Wisps of terrifying sword intent passed through the long spear and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>Sword slashes appeared on Lu Ming’s arm, and blood was flowing out.</p><p>As for Lu Ming himself, he retreated rapidly into the cold nether forbidden grounds.</p><p>As soon as he entered the cold nether forbidden grounds and came into contact with the cold nether energy, a chill instantly spread through Lu Ming’s body, causing him to shiver.</p><p>With a single thought, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around Lu Ming’s body, blocking the chill in the surroundings.</p><p>“This woman has such shocking strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on the beautiful woman.</p><p>This woman’s cultivation was at least a half-step Divine King. As for the extent of her awakened divine power, Lu Ming had no idea.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was certain that this lady’s abilities were definitely above the two half-step Divine King geniuses of the Qin clan.</p><p>“I don’t know you, why do you want to kill me? did the Jin family or the Qin family send you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He didn’t know this woman at all, but she wanted to kill him the moment they met. There was only one explanation, and that was that the Jin and Qin families had asked her to kill him, just like the big-nosed young man from before.</p><p>what Jin and Qin clan? it has nothing to do with me. I want to kill you. Die!</p><p>The absolute beauty said coldly. The aura on her body grew stronger. She took a step forward and rushed into the land of the cold nether. Another sword light burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>ancient God Body! Lu Ming roared. He activated his ancient God Body and turned into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>He waved his spear and a crescent-shaped spear light slashed out, blocking the opponent’s attack.</p><p>“Eh? You have some strength!”</p><p>The absolute beauty clearly did not expect Lu Ming to be able to block her attack. She was slightly stunned and her gaze turned even colder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura rushed out of the beautiful woman’s body. It was filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>“Nest, this is the origin divine power factor. This b * tch has awakened the origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Lu Ming was really shocked.</p><p>A half-step Divine King who had awakened the origin divine power factor would be able to pass through the heaven Gate.</p><p>Previously, there were a total of four people from the universal camp who had revealed their cultivation base. Now, it seemed like there was someone who had hidden her cultivation base and strength, and that person was this woman.</p><p>Or perhaps, this woman had entered star-moon ancient city after Lu Ming had.</p><p>No matter what, this level of ability was definitely not something that Lu Ming could withstand. The difference in combat strength was too great.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming turned and left, rushing toward the depths of the land of the cold nether.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
