His expression changed drastically, and his godly power surged. He activated beams of godly light, wanting to break through you Long’s attack and escape.</p><p>However, with you Long’s current strength, it was very easy for him to deal with a first level Divine King. With a swipe of his Dragon Claw, the attack of the first level Divine King was instantly shattered.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>An unwilling and shrill scream was heard. The first level Divine King expert’s body burst like a balloon from the dragon’s claw.</p><p>A God King had fallen just like that.</p><p>“Kill! Kill the people from the unique devil Academy first!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>As expected, you long had specifically targeted the people from the unique devil Academy and killed them.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They did not expect that such a powerful you long would really listen to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Stop him, stop him …”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief roared continuously. Together with the other experts, he continuously launched attacks. However, you long ignored their attacks and allowed them to land on his body. He was completely fine.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>After a while, another senior statesman of the unique demon Academy was caught by the Dragon Claw. With a tearing sound, he was torn into two and died on the spot.</p><p>Another Godking of the unique devil Academy had died.</p><p>The three overlords and the godkings of the other top factions were almost scared out of their wits. Some of the first level godkings even retreated.</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief let out a furious roar. His heart was bleeding.</p><p>That was two godkings!</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, godkings were considered peak powers. Even the three hegemon powers didn’t have many godkings. Now that two of them had died, his heart ached.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat …”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s Dean finally decided to retreat. With a furious roar, he led the other experts of the demonic Academy and quickly retreated. He pulled away from you long and did not dare to continue attacking.</p><p>As for the immortal sword sect and the boundless Holy Land, as well as the other top sects, they retreated even faster. They retreated far away before the Yimo Academy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>You long roared. He didn’t want to let his opponent off so easily. He twisted his body and charged forward again.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The expressions of the experts from the three Overlord forces and the other top sects changed. They didn’t dare to stay any longer. They turned around and ran as far away as they could.</p><p>“The others may leave, but the traitors must stay!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Lu Ming’s voice echoed throughout the entire area.</p><p>After that, you long changed his direction and charged towards Zhi Zun and the people from the Zhi Zun clan.</p><p>“Damn it, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>run! Supreme Being Dong roared as he used his divine power to escape with Supreme universe.</p><p>However, there were many people in the Supreme clan, and the others didn’t have this speed. You long twisted his body and caught up with the large group of people from the Supreme clan.</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>Many Supreme-being clans ‘people cried out in fear.</p><p>traitors must pay the price. Go!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Dark Dragon’s huge Dragon Claw swiped down.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Large groups of Supreme clan members exploded. Under the terrifying power of you long, they turned into ashes, their bodies and spirits destroyed.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of people from the Supreme clans had fallen.</p><p>The Supreme Being no longer cared about the other members of the Supreme Being clan. He brought the most talented junior of the Supreme Being clan, Supreme universe, and the other two godkings of the Supreme Being clan, fleeing madly.</p><p>“If the Autarchs move, you won’t be able to escape!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared. The bone demon controlled the dark Dragon and chased after the Supreme-being.</p><p>You Long’s body was huge and was hundreds of thousands of meters long. With a twist of his body, a terrifying power burst forth. Wherever he passed by, a large number of people from the Supreme clans were killed.</p><p>The reason why Lu Ming was so decisive and merciless was to intimidate them.</p><p>It would intimidate the other members of Kong Xuan sect who wanted to betray him.</p><p>As expected, upon seeing this scene, many of the Kong Xuan sect disciples turned pale and broke out in cold sweat. They rejoiced inwardly that they had not surrendered before. If they had surrendered, they would probably have ended up like this.</p><p>we can’t let the traitor go! The traitor must be punished!</p><p>At this moment, Yue Wu Ya shouted.</p><p>that’s right. We can’t let the Supreme clan off. Kong Xuan sect disciples, follow me and kill all the traitors!</p><p>The other doyen also shouted and soared into the sky, charging towards the people of the Supreme clan.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The entire Kong Xuan sect charged towards the Supreme clan.</p><p>How could a single Supreme-being clan be a match for the entire Kong Xuan sect? in a short while, all the members of the Supreme-being clan had been surrounded, and a bloody battle had begun.</p><p>“Don’t! Spare me!”</p><p>senior brother Gu, we have such a good relationship. Please spare me!</p><p>The people from the Supreme clan begged for mercy.</p><p>“Traitor, don’t try to befriend me. I was blind in the past and mistook you as a friend. Die in peace. Kill!”</p><p>How could the people of the Kong Xuan sect show any mercy? in order to prove their loyalty and that they were not on the same side as the Supreme clans, they attacked even more ruthlessly.</p><p>Large groups of people from the Supreme clan were killed.</p><p>At this moment, the dark Dragon was carrying Lu Ming and was about to catch up with the Supreme Being Dong and the other two divine kings from the Supreme Being clan.</p><p>“Director, help, help!”</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong shouted loudly and asked the Dean of the unique devil Academy for help.</p><p>He knew very well that with his strength, he was no match for you long. If you long caught up to him, only death would await him. Only the Dean of the unique demon Academy could save them.</p><p>However, the Dean of the unique demon Academy did not even bother to pay attention to him. He did not even look at him as he quickly flew forward.</p><p>What a joke! Why would he save Supreme martial artist Dong and the others? he was actually hoping that Supreme martial artist Dong and the others would be caught up to. That way, he would be able to delay them and allow them to escape safely.</p><p>When the Supreme martial artist saw that the unique devil Academy’s College chief was too lazy to pay attention to him, a look of despair appeared on his face.</p><p>demon executioner, you’re despicable and shameless. You’ll die a terrible death …</p><p>Supreme martial artist Dong roared in anger and cursed continuously.</p><p>the Supreme is moving. You’re courting death …</p><p>The eyes of the demonic Academy’s College chief turned cold. He turned around and slashed his demonic sword at the Supreme martial artist.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist was greatly alarmed, and he repeatedly launched attacks to block.</p><p>Although this was a casual strike from the demonic Academy’s College chief, its might was still terrifying. Even though the Supreme move had been blocked, he had no choice but to stop.</p><p>The moment he stopped, Lu Ming caught up to him.</p><p>“Paragons, move! Die!”</p><p>The dark Dragon’s Dragon Claw clawed at the Supreme martial artist. This claw was much more powerful than the sword attack of the unique devil Academy’s Dean.</p><p>“Paragon divine fist!”</p><p>Supreme move roared madly as his body glowed with a brilliant golden light. He punched out continuously with both fists, sending huge golden fist prints towards the dark dragon’s claw.</p><p>However, the Supreme move was only at the second level of the divine King realm. If you long could suppress a third level Divine King, how could a second level Divine King resist it?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out as the fist force of Supreme Being Dong crumbled. The Dragon Claw didn’t stop as it struck Supreme Being Dong’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
