He had a huge appetite and wanted to take all three array plates.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! sword Dao infinitum and grayflame Army breaker roared as they attacked at the same time. A terrifying sword light and a scorching fist force shot towards mo jiuye.</p><p>Mo jiuye’s expression changed and he could only defend with all his might.</p><p>However, he was fighting one against two. How could he fight against them? he was immediately forced to retreat.</p><p>As mo jiuye was forced back, boundless sword Dao and cangyan Jun breaker moved and grabbed an array plate each.</p><p>On the other side, Lu Ming also grabbed an array plate.</p><p>Almost at the same time, the three of them each grabbed an array plate and then retreated.</p><p>The three array plates were divided among the three of them.</p><p>“Damn it, you guys …”</p><p>Mo jiuye’s face turned extremely ugly when he saw this.</p><p>His appetite had been too big just now, wanting to take all three array plates for himself, but he had been forced back by sword Dao infinitum and grayflame Army breaker. He didn’t expect that after he retreated, he wouldn’t have a share of the array plates.</p><p>It was impossible for him to get the array plates that Lu Ming, sword Dao infinitum, and flame breaker had obtained. He was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, all of them turned to look outside the hall.</p><p>This was because there was a dazzling light shining outside the hall.</p><p>The few of them moved and rushed out of the hall. They saw that in the distant sky, there were many bright halos shining. It was clearly the light of the Galaxy formation.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why is this galaxy formation suddenly shining again? was there nothing unusual before?”</p><p>“Could it be that the godkings outside are attacking the formation again?”</p><p>Some people guessed.</p><p>it shouldn’t be possible. Since those godkings have already sent us in, they know that we are inside. It’s impossible for them to rashly attack the formation, nor would they allow others to attack the formation!</p><p>Someone said, and everyone agreed.</p><p>This galaxy formation was mysterious and unpredictable. No one knew what kind of danger it would cause if they attacked the formation from the outside. If they attacked the formation from the outside and all the geniuses who entered the Galaxy died, it would be a great loss. Why would those sect Masters and elders do that?</p><p>“Could it be that the twelve array plates have been taken by someone else, causing this abnormality?”</p><p>Another person guessed.</p><p>it’s possible, it’s very possible. Just now, senior brother Jian Dao and the others were fighting for the array plate. The moment they got the array plate, the light in the sky shone.</p><p>One of the immortal sword sect’s paragons shouted.</p><p>Many people nodded. This was the most likely possibility. It was very likely that all 12 array plates had been obtained by someone else, and that was why the Galaxy array had such a strange reaction.</p><p>“You guys, go out and take a look!”</p><p>“You guys go too!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wu Ji, mo jiuye, and the others each sent out a few heaven’s favorites to take a look.</p><p>The few of them rose into the air and flew out of the Galaxy.</p><p>The rest of the people waited quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming had also returned to his normal form and was waiting at the side with Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Soon, seven days had passed, and the young men who had gone out earlier returned.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>Mo jiuye was the first to ask.</p><p>“Senior brother, the array master outside has speculated that all the array plates have been obtained by someone else, which is why there is such a strange phenomenon. Everyone can go out now.”</p><p>One of the geniuses from the unique devil Academy replied.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Mo jiuye snorted coldly and glanced at Lu Ming with an unfriendly look. Then, he led the geniuses of the unique demon Academy and flew into the sky, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Sword Dao Wuji shouted and shot into the sky with the immortal sword sect’s elite.</p><p>“Brother Cang Yan, wait a moment!”</p><p>Just as cangyan pojun was about to move, Lu Ming called out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you call me for? Could it be that you want to exchange pointers with me?”</p><p>Cangyan po Jun stopped and stared at Lu Ming in confusion.</p><p>“There’s no need for sparring, brother Cang Yan, I wonder if you’re interested in array plates?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Of course I’m interested. What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Cangyan pojun was even more confused.</p><p>“I have two array plates here, how about I sell them to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and two array cards appeared in his palm.</p><p>“Sell it to me?”</p><p>This time, it was not just cangyan pojun. The other geniuses of the boundless Holy Land, including Ouyang Xiangxiang, all widened their eyes and looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had obtained the two array plates. Naturally, Ouyang Qingxiang would not say much about how he wanted to deal with them.</p><p>She suppressed the doubts in her heart and did not say much.</p><p>“Are you really going to sell it to me?”</p><p>Cangyan pojun asked again, he was really confused.</p><p>One must know that these array plates were what the sect Masters and elders outside wanted. With these array plates, those sect Masters and elders could enter this Galaxy and fight for the star core. As long as they handed over the array plates, they would definitely be rewarded handsomely.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to sell the array plate to him. He had ten thousand doubts in his heart.</p><p>of course it’s true. It’s absolutely true. You can exchange for it with precious metals or divine crystals!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>He had no intention of bringing the array plate out and offering it to Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>According to bone demon’s estimation, once Dragon Boat Mountain obtained a star core, it would definitely be of great use.</p><p>Dragon boats mountain was very useful, but it was disadvantageous to Lu Ming. He would not hand the array cards to dragon boats mountain.</p><p>Selling it to cangyan po Jun now was the most cost-effective.</p><p>“Alright, you guys, take out all the gold attributed materials you have, then offer up the array plate and we’ll split the reward equally.”</p><p>Cangyan pojun looked at the geniuses from the boundless sacred land.</p><p>One by one, the geniuses of the boundless Holy Land took out all the rare and precious metal materials they’d found in the Galaxy and piled them up.</p><p>“Brother Lu, how about these metal materials and a hundred million mid grade divine crystals for your two array plates?”</p><p>Cangyan pojun looked at Lu Ming uneasily.</p><p>To be honest, the price he offered was too low. If they went out with two array plates, the reward they would get would definitely be far above this number.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind. It was better to sell as much as possible than to offer it to Dragon Boat Mountain.</p><p>Cangyan po Jun was overjoyed. He handed the gold-attribute materials and one hundred million divine crystals to Lu Ming. Lu Ming also gave the two array plates to cangyan po Jun.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I’ll accept your favor. See you another day!”</p><p>Cangyan pojun laughed heartily and left with the geniuses of the boundless sacred land.</p><p>Qingxiang, please keep this matter a secret for me after you leave.</p><p>Lu Ming told Ouyang Qingxiang.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t let the Dragon Boat Mountain know about this.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Although Ouyang Qingxiang was puzzled, she still nodded.</p><p>Then, the two of them rose into the air and left the place.</p><p>After a period of time, they left the Galaxy.</p><p>Outside the star system, the sect heads of the Qin heaven thirteen clans and the other godkings were all waiting nervously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
