The bloody palm could only resist for two breaths before it exploded. The Spear’s radiance did not stop and bombarded the body of the Sorcerer’s blood.</p><p>Wu Xue let out a blood-curdling screech as his body was sent flying backward. He crashed heavily into the fighting ring and slid for hundreds of miles before flying out of the fighting ring.</p><p>The witch’s blood was defeated!</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was much easier to defeat the Sorcerer’s blood.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was focused on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated the witch Blood. The next match would be against the dark rose. As long as he defeated the dark rose, Lu Ming would be able to get first place and even win the beauty.</p><p>A gust of fragrant wind blew. Night Rose’s figure floated and landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Night rose was not wearing much. Her skin was as white as Jade, not fat or thin, and full of elasticity.</p><p>In addition to her beautiful face, she was even more alluring.</p><p>Her eyes were like silk as she swept her gaze across Lu Ming’s body, looking very satisfied.</p><p>However, for some reason, Lu Ming’s body tensed up involuntarily when the dark rose sized him up like that, as if he was facing a terrifying enemy.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>His body actually reacted instinctively. It was a reaction in the face of danger.</p><p>The night rose gave him a terrible sense of danger.</p><p>Clearly, night rose did not reveal the slightest killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled, but he did not show it on his face. He cupped his fists and said,”Please enlighten me, young lady!”</p><p>“I … I admit defeat!”</p><p>Just when everyone thought that the two of them were going to have a fierce battle, night Rose’s voice was heard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Before the battle even started, night rose had already admitted defeat. What was going on?</p><p>could it be that night rose saw Lu Ming’s abilities and knew that she was no match for him? that’s why she admitted defeat? ”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>I don’t think that’s right. The abilities that night rose displayed previously are simply unfathomable. She might be able to fight with Lu Ming. Why would she admit defeat without fighting? I think that he has taken a fancy to that kid. Hence, he might as well admit defeat without fighting!</p><p>Someone immediately retorted, causing many people to be stunned.</p><p>“Don’t tell me you’ve really taken a fancy to me? Sigh, it seems that being handsome is also a kind of trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also mumbling in his heart.</p><p>hahaha, alright. Since rose has admitted defeat, I shall announce that the champion of this competition is Lu Ming!</p><p>The night Demon Lord stood up and announced with a laugh.</p><p>“I’m so envious!”</p><p>Countless people cast envious and jealous gazes at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Wu Xue snorted coldly. He was extremely displeased. He glared at Lu Ming, his killing intent constantly flashing.</p><p>&Nbsp; at this time, the night Demon King took out another Jade bottle. This Jade bottle was much larger than the previous one, and it also contained the demon night spring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is five kilograms of demon night spring. It’s your reward!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, mo yequan flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out to take it and kept it in his storage ring.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let me ask you a question. Since you’ve come in first, are you willing to join Magic City mountain and become the demon Lord of Magic City mountain?”</p><p>The night Demon Lord asked.</p><p>“I’m willing!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and nodded in agreement.</p><p>“You agree?”</p><p>The night Demon Lord was slightly stunned. He did not expect Lu Ming to agree so readily.</p><p>“Yes, I agree!”</p><p>As Lu Ming spoke, his eyes could not help but sweep towards the night rose, as if he was reluctant to leave.</p><p>So that was how it was!</p><p>Many people nodded. They were well aware that Lu Ming had agreed without any hesitation because he was smitten by the night rose.</p><p>Indeed, how many men could resist the temptation of a bewitching Vixen like the night rose?</p><p>The night Demon Lord thought the same, and he was overjoyed.</p><p>Then, the night Demon King asked the other people in the top ten if they were willing to join Magic City mountain and become the demon Lord. However, all he got was a shake of the head.</p><p>The night Demon King was slightly disappointed, but he understood that most of these heaven’s favorites were from some major forces. A Demon Lord position was not enough to move them.</p><p>Unless there was the temptation of the night rose.</p><p>alright, the great battle in demonic city has ended. Next, I will hold a banquet. Everyone can enjoy to their heart’s content. We won’t leave until we’re drunk!</p><p>The night Demon Lord announced.</p><p>Then, the fighting stage was removed, and a large number of beautiful women flew out and began to set up the banquet in the open space.</p><p>After three rounds of wine, the crowd dispersed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can move into the city Lord’s mansion in the future!”</p><p>The night rose walked leisurely to Lu Ming’s side. A fragrance assailed Lu Ming’s nose.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming naturally agreed.</p><p>The purpose of his visit was to investigate the dark ice clan’s collusion with the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. The ice Soul clan’s patriarch suspected that magic Capital Mountain was very likely an informer of a major force in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, who was specifically working with the dark ice Clan.</p><p>Therefore, the best way to find out the truth was to enter the city Lord’s mansion.</p><p>Besides, it was also the best choice to enter the city Lord’s mansion since Qiu Yue and the rest were locked up there. This was exactly what Lu Ming wanted, so there was no reason for him to refuse.</p><p>That night, Lu Ming moved into the city Lord’s residence. Many people were envious of him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, the young lady would like to see you!”</p><p>On the evening of the third day, a maidservant came to invite Lu Ming.</p><p>Maidservant, of course, it was night Rose’s maidservant.</p><p>“He’s finally looking for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. For the past two days, the night rose did not come to look for Lu Ming. Now, they had finally come.</p><p>For the past two days, Lu Ming did not take the initiative to look for the night rose because he always felt a sense of danger from the night rose. This feeling made him very uncomfortable.</p><p>Unfortunately, bone demon wasn’t here, or he would have asked for his help.</p><p>As for the measure formula and the battle formula, although they had lived for countless years, they did not know much.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!”</p><p>Since night rose had taken the initiative to invite him, Lu Ming had no reason to reject her. He could take the opportunity to gather some information.</p><p>He followed the servant girl and walked around before arriving at a courtyard.</p><p>In the courtyard, there was a small bridge with flowing water and the fragrance of flowers. It was very elegant.</p><p>A Pavilion was built on a small river. There were stone tables and stools in the pavilion. Some food and wine were already placed on the table.</p><p>The sun had already set. In the pavilion, there were a few lit candles. The candlelight flickered and the light was dim.</p><p>“Brother Lu, please!”</p><p>Night rose stood up to welcome him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
