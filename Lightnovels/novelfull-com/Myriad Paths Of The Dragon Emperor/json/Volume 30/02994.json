It enveloped Lu Ming’s body, rendering him immobile.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming felt his vision turn black. The next moment, he appeared on a platform.</p><p>“This is … My spirit …”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>He knew that his physical body was definitely still outside. What had appeared here was his spiritual will.</p><p>There would definitely be a test waiting for him next.</p><p>As expected, a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>The figure’s appearance could not be seen clearly, but it was like a human shadow.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The shadow moved. There was a long sword in his hand. He thrust the sword at Lu Ming as fast as lightning.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>With a single thought, a long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hand and he thrust it out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear and the sword shadow collided. Lu Ming felt an extremely terrifying sword Qi rushing towards him. The long spear in his hand collapsed instantly. He retreated rapidly and was almost pierced by the sword.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Although he had attacked in a hurry and did not activate the battle formula, with the thick Shen power he had now, a casual spear attack could kill an enemy that was several levels higher.</p><p>However, the result was that he was forced to retreat.</p><p>One could only imagine how it would be possible for anyone else to pass. Ordinary Geniuses would only be Insta-killed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The shadow missed its first attack and continued to attack at an astonishing speed. Sword shadows shot toward Lu Ming one after another.</p><p>“Double the combat power!”</p><p>With a thought, he activated the double battle strength of the battle character formula. Instantly, his body was filled with energy.</p><p>it’s really possible. Just the spiritual will entering can trigger the battle formula!</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also shocked.</p><p>He had only wanted to give it a try, but he had not expected it to work.</p><p>After triggering the doubling of combat strength, Lu Ming’s combat strength soared and he swept the long spear horizontally.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After activating the ” battle ” symbol art that doubled his combat strength, Lu Ming’s combat strength was completely above his opponent’s. As the spear ray crushed over, his opponent’s sword shadows collapsed one after another.</p><p>In the end, the long spear struck the Shadow’s body. The Shadow’s body directly exploded and turned into a fake.</p><p>“There should be more!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He didn’t believe that he would pass through the heaven Gate so easily.</p><p>Indeed, the next moment, Three Shadows appeared in front of him and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, even the three Shadows were no match for the current Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying sword …”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the second move of the three indestructible strikes. The crescent-shaped spear ray swept across and one of the shadows was destroyed.</p><p>Soon, the three Shadows were all killed.</p><p>However, it wasn’t over yet. After the three Shadows disappeared, nine more shadows appeared.</p><p>The nine shadows joined hands to set up a large array, and its power increased many times.</p><p>Streaks of terrifying sword shadows slashed at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p><p>There was no doubt that if Lu Ming was hit by the sword shadow, his body would be severely injured.</p><p>In the beginning, one person entered the heavenly gate and died. There was a bloody mark between his brows, and his soul was destroyed. Most likely, he had suffered such an attack.</p><p>This made Lu Ming feel some pressure.</p><p>“Four times the battle power!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to delay any further. He immediately activated the battle formula that increased his combat strength by four times.</p><p>After erupting with four times his combat strength, Lu Ming naturally finished off his opponent in an overwhelming manner.</p><p>As the long spear pressed down, the black shadow exploded continuously and finally disappeared.</p><p>“Is it over? It can’t be that fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>As expected, it was not that simple. In the next moment, eighteen black shadows appeared, forming a large array and charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you want to try the ancient God Body? Forget it, I’d better keep a low profile!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it and decided not to use the ancient God Body.</p><p>After using the ancient God Body, he would definitely be crushed again.</p><p>If this was the last round, Lu Ming’s time was too short.</p><p>It had only been slightly more than a minute since he had entered this place.</p><p>Previously, Jin Yuan and the others had taken 15 minutes.</p><p>Qiu Yue had also used five minutes. If he had taken care of it in a minute, it would have been too shocking.</p><p>Therefore, he began to fight with the eighteen shadows.</p><p>Even a large array formed by eighteen shadows was not a match for Lu Ming now. Therefore, Lu Ming was able to deal with it easily.</p><p>Soon, five minutes had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear suddenly changed and its power increased.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance crushed down like a mountain and destroyed the opponent’s formation. Then, he attacked continuously and killed all eighteen shadows.</p><p>“I don’t think so!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>If there were more, he didn’t believe that gold ingot and the others could pass.</p><p>Indeed, after the shadow disappeared, a force appeared. Lu Ming’s vision turned black again. The next moment, when he opened his eyes, he realized that he was still standing in the middle of the sky Gate.</p><p>“It’s not that difficult!”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched lazily and smiled at Qiu Yue. He then stepped forward, passed through the Heaven’s Gate, and walked to Qiu Yue’s side.</p><p>“Over … It’s passed?”</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded and completely stunned.</p><p>One autumn month had passed, and now, Lu Ming had passed again.</p><p>A second level celestial deity and a fourth level celestial deity, what was going on?</p><p>Were their talents really that terrifying?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Qin family, Jin Xing, and the others all had gloomy expressions.</p><p>“This time, it’s incredible!”</p><p>Bai Li’s eyes glowed as he scanned Lu Ming and Qiu Yue from head to toe.</p><p>He knew the difficulty of the Heaven’s Gate better than anyone else.</p><p>To be able to pass without awakening the origin divine power factor, one’s talent must be unimaginably high.</p><p>It was usually hard to come across such a genius, but now, two of them had appeared.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and a few other members of the Wu family were full of praise.</p><p>I don’t believe it. Did the difficulty of the Heaven’s Gate drop this time? ”</p><p>At this moment, someone shouted and a young man in a yellow robe stepped out.</p><p>“It’s been reduced?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>“That’s right. I suspect that the difficulty of the heavenly gates has been lowered this time. Otherwise, how could so many people have passed? even two second and fourth level heavenly deities who have not awakened the divine power gene have passed? I don’t believe it!”</p><p>The yellow-robed youth said.</p><p>but someone tried it before and was killed in an instant!</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“That’s because that person is too useless!”</p><p>The yellow-robed youth said.</p><p>“Hmph, if you think that the difficulty has decreased, then you can give it a try!”</p><p>Jin Yuan snorted.</p><p>If the yellow-robed young man said that the difficulty of the Heaven’s Gate had been lowered, wasn’t he doubting his talent? of course, he was unhappy.</p><p>“That’s just what I want, I was planning to give it a try!”</p><p>The yellow-robed young man said. Then, he walked toward the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>His aura bloomed, and a powerful pressure spread in all directions.</p><p>This man was also a half-step Divine King.</p><p>I’ve only awakened eighty percent of my divine power! Jin Yuan snorted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
