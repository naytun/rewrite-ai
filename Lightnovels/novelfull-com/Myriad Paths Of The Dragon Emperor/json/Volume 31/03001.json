No wonder it was called a forbidden area.</p><p>It was indeed very dangerous for Ordinary Geniuses to enter.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming was flying when the mountains and the ground suddenly shook. Then, Lu Ming saw an Ice Mountain flying over from a distance and crashing down on him.</p><p>“Nest …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and dodged quickly. He retreated a hundred miles in an instant to avoid the ice Mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>It was really an Ice Mountain with an energy level of a thousand meters. It crashed heavily in front of Lu Ming and the ground shook continuously.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>A whistling sound was heard in the air, and then a large black shadow was cast down from the sky.</p><p>More icebergs came crashing toward Lu Ming. There was not only one but several of them in succession.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He retreated and dodged continuously. However, the icebergs continued to smash down and finally, there was one that Lu Ming could not avoid.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear with both hands and swung it down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance struck the ice Mountain, causing a violent boom. The ice Mountain shattered, and Lu Ming was sent flying by a terrifying force. After retreating a hundred miles, his qi and blood were in turmoil.</p><p>what a terrifying power. What is it? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stared ahead.</p><p>&Nbsp; he was maintaining his ancient God Body, so his strength was astonishing, but he had still almost been injured.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>At this moment, a roar came from the distance. Then, a huge creature rushed over.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. This time, it was not an iceberg but a giant ape that was charging at him.</p><p>This giant ape was huge and was thousands of meters tall. It was even bigger than the ice Mountain from before.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the giant ape was the one who threw the icebergs.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant ape stepped on an Ice Mountain, causing it to explode. Ice shards flew in all directions, and the ground shook violently.</p><p>A ferocious aura gushed out and surged towards Lu Ming. A pair of huge eyes stared at Lu Ming, filled with killing intent.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant ape bellowed in rage and stomped on the ground, blasting a huge pit in the ground. Its huge body pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had transformed into an ancient God and was more than two hundred meters tall. However, in front of the giant ape, he was not even an infant.</p><p>A fist larger than a mountain came crashing toward Lu Ming, bringing with it a terrifying gust of wind.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat …”</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to take it head-on and retreated rapidly.</p><p>However, the opponent’s fist force was too powerful. The air kept exploding and Lu Ming’s speed was greatly affected.</p><p>There was no other way. In the end, Lu Ming could only take it head-on.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast his strongest move. A huge spear ray burst out and stabbed at the giant ape.</p><p>When the Spear’s radiance was about to approach the giant ape, it exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The force spread in all directions, but Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging towards him. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming made use of this force to retreat rapidly. Coupled with the speed of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, he retreated tens of thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming turned around and dashed backward rapidly.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant ape roared angrily and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>this giant ape has such terrifying strength. I’m afraid that it has also awakened a power similar to the origin divine power factor in its body!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The living beings now could be considered the descendants of the original gods. More or less, they all had a trace of the bloodline of the original gods.</p><p>It was the same even for those wild beasts and divine beasts.</p><p>Therefore, many dire beasts and vicious beasts would awaken powers similar to the origin divine power factor, which was very terrifying.</p><p>It was obvious that this giant ape had awakened a similar power. Its abilities were very shocking. Lu Ming was no match for it at all. He was not its match even when he used the supernova and was injured in an instant.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a Kunpeng and flew at high speed. However, the giant ape’s speed was extremely shocking and it chased closely after Lu Ming.</p><p>Very quickly, a few minutes passed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a sword light coming at him at high speed.</p><p>“It’s her …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The owner of the sword gleam was the beautiful woman who had chased after Lu Ming previously.</p><p>Seeing this woman, Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was overjoyed. Without thinking, he immediately rushed toward the beautiful woman.</p><p>At the next moment, the absolute beauty also saw Lu Ming. When she saw Lu Ming rushing toward her instead, she could not help but be stunned.</p><p>She did not quite understand why Lu Ming suddenly rushed toward her.</p><p>However, she immediately understood. It was because she saw the giant ape.</p><p>She understood that Lu Ming wanted to use her to fight against the giant ape.</p><p>However, was this possible?</p><p>The beautiful woman’s eyes were filled with cold light. She was about to make a move when she and the giant ape attacked from the front and back, killing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Honey, it’s great that you’re here! Let’s kill that giant ape together!” Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>What?</p><p>Wife?</p><p>The absolute beauty was stunned again. The next moment, she reacted and screamed, ” “You, shameless …”</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already not far away from the absolute beauty.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The giant ape roared. It stretched out a huge palm and grabbed at the ground. A huge Ice Mountain was conjured. With a wave of its hand, the huge Ice Mountain smashed towards Lu Ming, shrouding the beautiful woman within.</p><p>“Honey, help!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and dodged to the left and right, avoiding the iceberg.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s plan. This giant ape had such a high cultivation level, so it must be very intelligent. It would definitely be able to understand what they were saying.</p><p>Therefore, when Lu Ming called out ‘wife’, the giant ape would definitely mistake the beautiful woman for Lu Ming’s gang. Naturally, its attack would also envelop the beautiful woman.</p><p>Obviously, Lu Ming’s plan had succeeded.</p><p>Being enveloped by the ice Mountain, the absolute beauty could only fight back.</p><p>A bright sword light burst out and cut the ice Mountain in half.</p><p>“This crazy woman is really powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Just now, he had experienced the terror of the giant ape. However, the absolute beauty had split the ice Mountain with a single sword strike. Her strength was shocking.</p><p>The giant ape’s gaze also turned to the absolute beauty.</p><p>The absolute beauty gave it a strong pressure, making it instinctively feel a trace of danger.</p><p>Therefore, the giant ape roared and pounced on the beautiful woman, leaving Lu Ming behind.</p><p>To it, Lu Ming was not dangerous. On the contrary, the beautiful woman was. Of course, it had to eliminate the danger first.</p><p>The mountain-like fist was aimed at the beautiful woman, and she could only counterattack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of the sword resounded through the nine Heavens as a glass-like sword light, over ten thousand meters long, slashed towards the giant ape.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them engaged in a great battle. The entire place was in chaos and razed to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
