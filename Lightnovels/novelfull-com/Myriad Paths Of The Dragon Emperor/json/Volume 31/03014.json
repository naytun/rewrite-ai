Whoever defeated the person on the stone platform could replace the other party and cultivate on the stone platform for three months.</p><p>In other words, on the stone platform, one had to accept a challenge every three months. If one could defeat the Challenger, they could continue to cultivate.</p><p>on this stone platform, the higher you go and the closer you are to myriad God cliff, the better the effects of cultivation. Therefore, you can also challenge those who go up. However, the higher you are on the stone platform, the more powerful you are. Ordinary people are no match for you!</p><p>The honest-looking young man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, his gaze landing on the stone platform at the top.</p><p>There were three stone platforms at the very top and the one closest to myriad God cliff. Three figures were sitting cross-legged on them.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming recognized one of them. He was one of the four top geniuses who had passed the Heaven’s Gate. He was a half-step Divine King who had awakened the divine power source.</p><p>Although the other two had not awakened the origin divine power factor, their abilities were probably also extremely shocking.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s gaze moved downwards.</p><p>He discovered that there were a total of 108 stone platforms. Some of the stone platforms even had people Lu Ming was familiar with.</p><p>“People from the Qin clan and the Jin clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with coldness.</p><p>On a few stone platforms sat people from the Qin clan. These people were the ones who had wanted to surround and kill Lu Ming.</p><p>In addition, there were also acquaintances in the Jin family.</p><p>Jin Xing was one of them.</p><p>“Everyone’s here, hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, his voice cold.</p><p>“By the way, brother, how long can each of us cultivate up there?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>everyone can cultivate for three years. After three years, you can’t go up, unless you wait for the next time you come in!</p><p>The honest-looking young man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was no wonder that a few of the top talents were not around. Logically speaking, those talents would not miss such a place. It seemed that some of them had already cultivated for three years. Perhaps some of them were not in a hurry.</p><p>After all, they could stay in star-moon ancient city for ten years.</p><p>Everyone stood in the air and waited quietly. Many of them were ready for a big battle at any time.</p><p>There were more wolves than meat. There were only 108 stone platforms in total, but there were thousands of people here.</p><p>Even if each person could only cultivate for three years, many people could not go up there to cultivate. If they wanted to go up there to cultivate, they could only compete with their strength.</p><p>Very quickly, a day had passed.</p><p>“Someone’s three-month deadline is coming up!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone spoke, his eyes shining.</p><p>Many people’s gazes fell on a young man with a scale between his brows in the bottommost row.</p><p>“People from the Qin family, what a coincidence. I want this seat!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>At this moment, the light barrier around the Qin clan’s heaven’s chosen suddenly began to glow. When the light reached its limit, it quickly dimmed. Then, the heaven’s chosen opened his eyes.</p><p>At the same time, at least a hundred figures rushed out towards the stone platform.</p><p>“I want this stone platform!”</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? Get lost! This challenge is mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>Angry roars rang out one after another, and then a brilliant divine light filled the air. Hundreds of people fought fiercely in the air. Everyone wanted to step onto the stone platform and obtain the right to challenge.</p><p>Whoever stepped onto the stone platform first would have the right to challenge.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the void, there were constant rumbles and terrifying explosions. All kinds of divine light and attacks were constantly colliding.</p><p>However, the young men who were cultivating on the stone platform didn’t seem to feel anything.</p><p>It was obvious that the light shield formed by the formation protected them and even isolated them from the outside world. This way, they could cultivate in peace and not be disturbed by the outside world.</p><p>A total of more than a hundred heaven’s favorites were fighting intensely. For a moment, no one could step onto the stone platform.</p><p>This was because whoever approached the stone platform would be attacked by the others.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A heaven’s pride expert let out a blood-curdling screech. He wanted to rush up the stone platform, but he was attacked by the others. Dozens of divine lights drowned that heaven’s pride expert. After the blood-curdling screech, that heaven’s pride expert vanished into thin air, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>The killing continued. People were constantly injured, and people were retreating.</p><p>The remaining people didn’t make a move, because some of them knew their own limitations. They knew that they weren’t strong enough and wouldn’t be able to compete even if they went up.</p><p>“I want this stone platform!”</p><p>At this moment, the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a faint smile. His figure suddenly moved and he dashed toward the stone platform like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>His speed was astonishing as he rapidly approached the stone platform.</p><p>However, the others had also noticed Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Many people made their moves. In an instant, dozens of divine lights shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“The kun Peng of the ninth heaven!”</p><p>kun Peng! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. His divine power condensed into a kun Peng. With a flap of its wings, his figure suddenly accelerated and dodged the attacks. In the next moment, he landed on the stone platform.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. They actually didn’t have the time to make a move just now.</p><p>After that, many people sighed. It seemed that they wouldn’t have a share of this stone platform.</p><p>Once someone stepped onto the stone platform, the others would no longer be able to compete. Seeing that Lu Ming had stepped onto the stone platform, the battle in the air stopped and everyone’s eyes fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>Stepping onto the stone platform was only the first step. In order to obtain the right to cultivate on the stone platform, one had to defeat the person who had cultivated before.</p><p>Unless the other party voluntarily withdrew after the three years were up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>of course it’s me. It’s time to settle the score with you all for besieging me that day!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Settle accounts? Hehe, just you?”</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon sneered as a powerful aura emanated from his body.</p><p>Ninth level celestial deity!</p><p>The cultivation of this Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert was at the ninth level of the heavenly deity realm. Furthermore, this time, he had already cultivated on this stone platform for half a year. The degree of his divine power awakening had increased by a lot and had already reached fifty percent.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to settle scores with him? You’re looking for death!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. He took a step forward and a huge aura rose.</p><p>All the divine power in his body exploded. The divine power on the surface of his body jumped and burned like flames.</p><p>After that, the battle formula was activated.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not use his ancient God Body.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he did not need the ancient God Body to deal with a ninth-tier celestial God with a fifty percent awakened divine power.</p><p>A terrifying aura rushed toward the other party like an avalanche.</p><p>The other party’s pupils suddenly widened and he exclaimed, ” “Your aura … How is this possible?”</p><p>The Qin family’s youth was frightened. How could a fifth level celestial deity have such a terrifying aura!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
