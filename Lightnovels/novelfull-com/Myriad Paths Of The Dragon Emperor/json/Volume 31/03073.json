She was only half a step away from the divine King realm and seemed to be able to break through to the divine King realm at any time.</p><p>Moreover, she was extremely powerful. She was even more powerful than when they were in star-moon ancient city. Lu Ming felt that she was even more powerful than Jin Yuan and not any weaker than Chu baxing.</p><p>Clearly, Lu Ming was not the only one who had improved in star-moon ancient city. The others had also improved.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and instantly activated the fourfold combat strength of the battle character formula, causing his combat strength to surge. Then, he struck down with his spear.</p><p>A crescent-shaped spear ray was shot towards LAN Ling.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The second collision stirred up even more shocking waves.</p><p>Fortunately, the two of them had already flown high up in the sky. Otherwise, the entire universal camp would have been alarmed by them.</p><p>This collision still didn’t determine the winner.</p><p>“The second move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>LAN Ling’s expression turned even uglier and the sword intent on her body grew stronger.</p><p>“Godly Sword Art, kill!”</p><p>die! LAN Ling shouted. She waved her sword, creating countless sword shadows and sword intent. Each of them was ten thousand meters long.</p><p>The entire void was filled with the shadow of her sword.</p><p>Then, countless sword shadows slashed at Lu Ming with infinite power.</p><p>If Lu Ming had not broken through to the sixth-level celestial deity realm, he would definitely have to transform into a green-armored ancient God to block this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not need to do so now.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon, ice chains …”</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming cast two secret skills, the divine Dragon phenomenon and the ice chain.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Dragon roars reverberated through the sky.</p><p>Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons flew out and pounced toward the sword shadows that filled the sky.</p><p>At the same time, the nine ice chains were like dancing ice dragons, circling Lu Ming’s body. The terrifying chill almost froze the space, and pieces of ice appeared in the space.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The divine Dragon phenomenon was the first to be hit. It collided with the sword shadows that filled the sky and exploded continuously.</p><p>However, very quickly, the nine divine Dragons collapsed in the sky full of sword shadows. Then, the sky full of sword shadows slashed at the ice chains. Countless ice blocks exploded, and the ice chains shook endlessly.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear continued to thrust out. Rays of spear light flew out like meteors and collided with LAN Ling’s sword shadow.</p><p>The void rumbled continuously for a few minutes before the collision stopped.</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters. However, his breathing was stable and he successfully blocked the sword shadow of the Indigo spirit.</p><p>LAN Ling’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Back then, when they were in star-moon ancient city, Lu Ming could only run for his life when he saw her. He might not even be able to withstand one of her moves. However, Lu Ming could actually withstand three of her moves now.</p><p>Most importantly, she had already used her ultimate move for the last move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had improved too quickly.</p><p>“Three moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“I don’t believe that I can’t suppress you today!”</p><p>LAN Ling flew into a rage out of humiliation. She let out a delicate cry and released a terrifying aura as she charged towards Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. In a flash, he charged toward LAN Ling. As he did so, his body swelled up and he turned into a green-armored ancient God.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>&Nbsp; the green-armored ancient God was several hundred meters tall, so massive that LAN Ling was like an ant in comparison.</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and grabbed the Indigo spirit.</p><p>The palm grabbed out, and the sky rumbled. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>“Godly Sword Art, slash, slash, slash!”</p><p>LAN Ling bellowed. Sword shadows soared into the sky and slashed at Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming controlled the ice chain to wrap around his palm to strengthen his defense.</p><p>With the ice chains and the green-armored ancient God’s Green scales, Lu Ming had no fear of LAN Ling’s sword shadow.</p><p>As the hand came down, LAN Ling’s sword shadows were shattered.</p><p>LAN Ling’s expression changed drastically. She wanted to retreat but it was too late. She reached out and caught LAN Ling in her hand. LAN Ling struggled desperately but Lu Ming controlled his divine energy. The terrifying divine energy surged into LAN Ling’s body. With a shock, LAN Ling let out a soft gasp. She felt that the divine energy in her body had almost been scattered. Her body trembled and she lost all her strength.</p><p>As a result, he was firmly controlled by Lu Ming and could not resist.</p><p>At Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, he could completely suppress the Indigo spirit after transforming into the green-armored ancient God.</p><p>After taking control of the Indigo spirit, Lu Ming’s body quickly shrank and returned to his normal state. He used an ice chain to trap the Indigo spirit.</p><p>“Let me go, quickly let me go!”</p><p>LAN Ling shouted and struggled madly, but it was useless. She couldn’t break free.</p><p>“Let you go? You’ve tried to kill me time and time again in star-moon ancient city. To think that I’ve even saved you. Now, you’ve tried to kill me again. Tell me, do you think I’ll let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and walked to LAN Ling’s side.</p><p>“Then … Then what do you want to do?”</p><p>LAN Ling said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“What do you want? What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and his eyes wandered all over LAN Ling’s body.</p><p>“You … Don’t even think about it. I’m telling you, my father is definitely watching this place. Do you dare?”</p><p>LAN Ling called out.</p><p>“Your father? Your father can’t wait for me to execute you on the spot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>On Star Peak, in LAN Shang’s garden, LAN Shang had just taken a sip of tea, but at this moment, he spat it all out.</p><p>“This little fellow … How can you say that!” LAN Shang muttered, feeling a little awkward.</p><p>That’s right. Everything that happened between Lu Ming and LAN Ling was under the watch of LAN Shang.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was right. If Lu Ming really wanted to ‘do’ the Indigo spirit, he would be more than happy to do so.</p><p>“You … You … Nonsense …”</p><p>LAN Ling glared at Lu Ming with hatred.</p><p>“But don’t worry, I’m not interested in you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, causing LAN Ling to clench her teeth. She did not know why, but she had an uncomfortable feeling in her heart.</p><p>Lu Ming was not interested in her?</p><p>Was she really that unattractive?</p><p>It had to be said that women’s thoughts were very strange.</p><p>“However, punishment is inevitable. If I don’t teach you a lesson, I won’t feel good either!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took a step forward. He stretched out his palm and slapped a certain part of the Indigo spirit beast. Following that, he taught it a lesson.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
