It can greatly affect the star core of a Divine King. I made it myself. Take it. It might be useful to you!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“King’s Pagoda!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen this type of treasure before on Magic City mountain.</p><p>During the battle of demonic city mountain, some of the young heaven’s favorites had used a similar treasure to attack the night Demon King.</p><p>This kind of treasure could affect a Godking’s star core, destabilizing it and reducing its power.</p><p>.com</p><p>Back then, the night Demon Lord had been killed in this way.</p><p>of course, this King suppression Pagoda can only affect fourth or fifth level godkings at most. The higher the cultivation, the smaller the effect. Use it as you see fit!</p><p>LAN Shang warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and kept it with joy. If he used the king’s suppression tower well, he could turn the tables at a critical moment.</p><p>After that, he chatted with LAN Shang for a while more before he left.</p><p>When he was leaving, he saw LAN Ling. LAN Ling was the same as before, snorting coldly and ignoring Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was happy to be free. He returned to his residence and bade Qiu Yue farewell.</p><p>Lu Ming had no intention of bringing Qiu Yue back to the Qin heaven Star Zone.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation had just improved greatly, so she needed time to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming felt that this trip would not be peaceful. It was better for him to act alone.</p><p>However, Qiu Yue wanted to go back with Lu Ming after hearing that. In the end, Lu Ming shook his head firmly and Qiu Yue gave up.</p><p>After bidding Qiu Yue farewell, Lu Ming stepped into the teleportation array to return to the Qin heaven Galaxy.</p><p>After a long journey, Lu Ming finally returned to the Qin heaven Star Zone. He stepped out of the teleportation array on planet myriad spirit.</p><p>Qin Tian Starfield, I’ve finally returned!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and smiled.</p><p>This time, when he returned to the Qin heaven star area, he didn’t just want to destroy the dark ice Clan and take back the nine absolute divine crystal. He also wanted to settle some old scores.</p><p>“Let’s go back to the Kong Xuan sect first!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Then, he continued to take the teleportation formation and headed toward the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>He was teleported to a planet not far away from planet Kong Xuan. Then, Lu Ming soared into the sky, crossed the void, and rushed to planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation level, it was a piece of cake for him to cross the universe with his physical body.</p><p>Now, his speed of crossing the starry sky with his physical body was faster than many starry sky battleships. For example, the starry sky battleship in Lu Ming’s hands was not even as fast as his physical body.</p><p>Like a Phantom, he flew through the universe. In front of him, a planet slowly grew bigger. It was the Kong Xuan planet.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, a meteorite came crashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This meteorite had a diameter of a thousand miles. It had been floating in the starry sky and suddenly crashed into Lu Ming.</p><p>“There’s a sneak attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and threw a punch at the meteorite.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared and pounced out. It was 10000 meters long and its body wriggled as it charged toward the meteorite. It collided with the meteorite.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering boom, the meteorite exploded into tiny pieces of gravel that flew in all directions.</p><p>Lu Ming could easily shatter a meteorite with a diameter of a thousand miles.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly, his eyes sweeping the surroundings.</p><p>“Hehehe, Lu Ming, I haven’t seen you for a while. Your cultivation has improved a lot!”</p><p>A sneer sounded. An old man appeared where the meteorite had exploded.</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming with a cold expression.</p><p>“It’s you, Elementalist!”</p><p>There was a flash of killing intent in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>This old man was none other than the inner sect elder of the Kong Xuan sect, an Elementalist.</p><p>His disciple, Ying Cang, had been killed by Lu Ming. The Tian Hong Saint son, who was supported by elementalists, had also been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming had killed the Tian Hong Saint son, the elementalists had sought refuge with the Supreme Saint son.</p><p>Later on, the Supreme-being family head betrayed the Kong Xuan sect and was killed by Lu Ming. However, during that battle, the elementalists happened to be away for some matters and were lucky enough to escape.</p><p>He knew that after the Supreme-being clan leader was killed, he did not dare to return to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>However, his hatred for Lu Ming could be said to be monstrous. All these years, he had been wandering around planet Kong Xuan, waiting for Lu Ming to be alone so that he could kill Lu Ming and vent his hatred.</p><p>However, he had already arrived at the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion by then. The elementalist had waited for so many years, and heaven did not let down those who put in their hearts. Finally, he had waited for Lu Ming, and he was alone.</p><p>He attacked without hesitation.</p><p>The meteorite just now had been pushed over by an Elementalist.</p><p>“Hehehe, Lu Ming, today is the day you die!”</p><p>The elementalist sneered, his killing intent extremely cold.</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently with a hint of disdain.</p><p>When Lu Ming first entered the Kong Xuan sect, elementalists were indeed superior to him. They were unattainable and could kill him with a flip of his hand.</p><p>However, all these were in the past. Lu Ming had grown rapidly. He was no longer afraid of a peak celestial God Elementalist.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if it wasn’t for the fact that someone has been helping you, I would have killed you in disguise!”</p><p>The elementalist shouted coldly. He released his aura, and a powerful pressure filled the air.</p><p>“Half-step Divine King!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s right. Half-step Divine King. Thanks to you, I’ve broken through to the half-step Divine King realm under the immense pressure. No matter how talented you are, you’re still vulnerable in my eyes!”</p><p>The elementalist laughed wildly.</p><p>In his mind, no matter how talented and monstrous Lu Ming was, it had only been a few years. Lu Ming was definitely not his match.</p><p>After killing Lu Ming, he would be able to find a place to cultivate. He might even be able to break through to the divine King realm and become an expert of the Qin heaven Galaxy. He would be able to live a carefree life.</p><p>Oh, since you’re so confident, I’ll give you a chance. Attack me with your strongest attack, so you can die in peace!</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Kid, What are you playing at?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calmness and self-confidence caused the elementalist to narrow his eyes slightly. He was a little bewildered and uncertain. He glanced around, afraid that there were other people present.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m alone, no one else!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Hmph, brat, I don’t care what tricks you’re playing. In front of absolute power, everything is useless. Die!”</p><p>The elementalist roared and threw a punch.</p><p>A stream of fist force, like a beam of light, blasted toward Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to be drowned.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard and a nine-clawed Divine Dragon was formed. It roared into the sky and pounced on the fist force of the elementalist.</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s aura was violent. It was several times stronger than the aura that Lu Ming had when he shattered the meteorite.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon crashed into the elementalist’s fist force and immediately dispersed it. However, the nine-clawed Divine Dragon itself was completely unharmed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
