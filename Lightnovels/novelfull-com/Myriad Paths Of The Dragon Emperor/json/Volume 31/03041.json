He condensed a palm with his divine power, landed on the stone door, and pushed with all his might.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The stone door slowly opened, revealing a dark passage. From the beginning to the end, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>haha, I told you so many years have passed. It’s impossible to be a threat, you cowards!</p><p>The young man laughed smugly.</p><p>However, the next moment, his expression suddenly changed. His body was like a frightened Grasshopper as he leaped up and retreated more than a thousand meters.</p><p>Not only him, but the others ‘faces also changed.</p><p>Because at this moment, the skeletons sitting on the ground had undergone an astonishing change.</p><p>These skeletons were covered in white light.</p><p>As the white light spread out, the skeletons ‘bodies actually dissolved into white powder and flew into the air.</p><p>All the skeletons were the same, starting from their heads, turning into white powder and scattering in the air.</p><p>Soon, all the skeletons disappeared, turning into white powder.</p><p>The powder gathered in the air and emitted a blinding white light. Then, the white light turned into a scene that appeared in the air.</p><p>In this scene, there were more than 300 experts from different races. These experts were standing in a secret chamber.</p><p>Everyone could tell at a glance that the secret room was almost the same as this stone room.</p><p>It wasn’t hard to guess that those three hundred experts were most likely the three hundred skeletons from before.</p><p>“Could it be that this is the scene of those experts when they were alive?”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>Many people nodded. That was most likely the case.</p><p>At this time, the 300 powerhouses in the image all raised their hands and made a vow.</p><p>we swear an oath with our lives to guard the life soul vitality stone for all eternity!</p><p>we swear an oath with our lives to guard the life soul vitality stone for all eternity!</p><p>we swear an oath with our lives to guard the life soul vitality stone for all eternity!</p><p>…..</p><p>Voices reverberated in the stone chamber.</p><p>The voices of the people in the image could actually be heard clearly.</p><p>The voice continued to echo for a few minutes before it disappeared. The image also slowly disappeared, leaving the stone chamber empty.</p><p>However, many of them were deep in thought.</p><p>It was not difficult to guess from the words just now that the more than 300 experts had made an oath to guard the life Soul Origin stone.</p><p>Therefore, they sat there cross-legged until they died of old age.</p><p>Then, what was a life soul vitality stone? Was it worth so many experts protecting it with their lives?</p><p>Moreover, it seemed that the life soul vitality stone was here. It was very likely that it was behind the stone door.</p><p>Many people’s eyes began to burn with a fiery light.</p><p>They didn’t know what a life soul vitality stone was.</p><p>However, it was definitely an extremely precious treasure that was worth so many powerhouses, who were likely to be godkings and above, guarding it with their lives.</p><p>It was very likely that it was a peerless treasure left behind in star-moon ancient city during the beginning of the heavenly Palace era.</p><p>How valuable was such a treasure?</p><p>Many people revealed their burning greed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, someone moved. His figure flickered and he rushed towards the passage behind the stone door.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“The treasure is mine!”</p><p>A slight change in the direction of one hair would affect the whole body. Once someone moved, the others also rushed to move, one after another rushing into that passage.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming also moved. He followed the crowd and rushed toward the passage.</p><p>The passage behind the stone door was very wide, enough to accommodate thousands of people.</p><p>On both sides of the passage, there were stone statues that looked like they were about to decay. Many of the stone statues were covered in cracks.</p><p>The crowd did not mind and charged forward with all their might.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the stone statues on both sides of the passage moved. The stone statues bounced and charged toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Some of the stone statues brandished their stone swords, while others brandished their stone Spears. Their power was astonishing.</p><p>A few young men were hit by the stone statues and died.</p><p>There were also quite a few people who reacted quickly and hurriedly blocked, but they were also injured.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The stone sword slashed down at Lu Ming’s head at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch without a second thought. A nine-clawed Divine Dragon condensed and pounced forward. It collided with the stone sword with a loud bang. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he drifted backward.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with solemness.</p><p>After exchanging blows with them, he realized that the strength of these stone statues was astonishing.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After the stone statue was blocked, it waved its stone sword and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately activated the quadruple combat power of the battle formula. A level nine high-quality divine artifact appeared in his hand and he swung his spear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear and the stone sword collided with each other, producing a violent boom.</p><p>Finally, the stone statue was sent flying by Lu Ming. A few pieces of stone fell off the stone sword and there were more cracks.</p><p>it’s unknown how many years have passed since this stone statue was created. It’s covered in cracks, but it still possesses such strength. I wonder how terrifying it would be at its peak!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>These stone statues were covered in cracks and looked like they were about to fall apart, but their power was still amazing.</p><p>If they were in perfect condition, even a God King would be killed if they entered.</p><p>Perhaps, it was more than that.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind rapidly. He continued to pounce forward, his long spear constantly sweeping at the statue.</p><p>With the boost from the battle character formula, which was four times more powerful, Lu Ming completely crushed the statue. After seven to eight consecutive collisions, the statue fell to the ground with a loud bang and completely fell apart, turning into a pile of rubble.</p><p>At this moment, the other heaven’s favorites also started to fight back. Many statues were smashed into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward after destroying one of the stone statues. Not long after, he was attacked by another stone statue, but it was easily shattered by Lu Ming.</p><p>Just like that, they advanced and killed along the way.</p><p>There were many stone statues on both sides of the passage. It was not difficult to guess that in the distant past, the more than 300 experts in the stone chamber were the first stage.</p><p>These stone statues were the second stage of the defense.</p><p>However, due to the long passage of time, those powerhouses who were guarding the place had long fallen and turned into ashes.</p><p>These stone statues were also on the verge of rotting and did not have much strength left. Otherwise, with their cultivation, they would be sending themselves to their deaths.</p><p>Even so, there were still people dying.</p><p>Of course, those who died weren’t very strong. Those who had reached the half-step Divine King realm could still be dealt with if they were careful.</p><p>This passageway was extremely long. They had rushed out a distance of a few hundred miles and still had not reached the end.</p><p>However, there were no more stone statues on the sides of the passage.</p><p>Many people heaved a sigh of relief and continued to move forward.</p><p>However, runes suddenly appeared on both sides of the passage. A divine light flashed, and a Young heaven’s favorite screamed as he was killed by the divine light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
