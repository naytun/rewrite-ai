If he were to solve it himself, wouldn’t he still be dead?</p><p>“It seems that he knows that he will die and is willing to risk everything. He doesn’t want to drag the Wu family down and is willing to die!”</p><p>“It seems like he’s quite loyal!”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“Very well, brat, kill yourself and I’ll leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>The cold voice of the winged man clan’s clan head rang out.</p><p>Unless he had no other choice, he really didn’t want to take action personally. Killing a heavenly God Realm junior would be embarrassing if word got out.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Suicide? Why should I commit suicide?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips slightly and said, ” ever since I came to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, I’ve been ambushed in secret. After I came to the universal camp, I’ve been constantly made difficult by you geniuses from various aristocratic families. You want to kill me at all times. I’ve always been curious why you’re targeting me and trying to kill me. Now, I understand …</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming paused for a moment and then shouted, ” that’s because you are the ones behind the theft of the nine absolute God crystal and I have your evidence. That’s why you want to kill me and take the evidence from me. You aren’t even afraid of losing face. The head of the family has to do it himself, right? ”</p><p>“What? There’s actually such a thing?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words shocked many people.</p><p>Some people even looked at the people from the three aristocratic families with suspicion in their eyes.</p><p>The nine absolute God crystal being stolen by the Qin heaven Starfield was not a secret.</p><p>Only those with some brains could guess that the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion definitely had a mole. Otherwise, how could someone from the Qin heaven Starfield steal the nine absolute God crystal?</p><p>More importantly, who was the spy? He hadn’t been able to find any clues.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming said this, everyone could not help but suspect that this spy was really from the Jin, Qin, or the winged ones?</p><p>The three patriarchs ‘expressions changed as well.</p><p>This was a serious crime. If it was true, even the overlords of the three great aristocratic families would have to bear the blame.</p><p>“Little brat, what nonsense are you talking about?”</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan shouted, his aura berserk.</p><p>“I’ll slaughter you!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family became even more violent. He took a step forward and was about to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you want to silence me and destroy the evidence?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the master of the Jin family stopped in his tracks. His face was extremely cold, and the murderous intent in his eyes was getting stronger and stronger.</p><p>He was so depressed that he wanted to vomit blood. However, at this moment, he really could not kill Lu Ming. If he did, wouldn’t he be confirming Lu Ming’s words?</p><p>“You’re full of nonsense. Do you know what a great crime it is to slander us?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t you know if you’re slandering me or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid at all. His voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>This caused the patriarch of the winged world clan and the patriarch of the Qin clan to feel bewildered.</p><p>Among them, the master of the Jin family wanted to kill Lu Ming the most. Could it be that what Lu Ming said was true? was the Jin family really a spy who deliberately dragged them down?</p><p>The patriarch of the Jin clan glanced at the expressions of the patriarchs of the winged man family and the Qin clan. How could he not know what the other party was thinking? the flames of anger in his heart burned even more fiercely.</p><p>little brat, you said you have evidence to prove who was the one who stole the nine absolute God crystal. Alright, show it now, show the evidence.</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>that’s right. Show me the evidence. If you’re lying, I’ll make you beg for death!</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan also shouted loudly.</p><p>The two of them looked as if they had a clear conscience, which made Lu Ming feel a little bewildered.</p><p>Could it be that these families really weren’t the ones who stole the nine absolute God crystal, or were they just trying to hold on?</p><p>“Alright, if you want to see, I’ll show you!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted, his voice traveling far and wide.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, there was a flash in the sky and a figure appeared next to Lu Ming.</p><p>The figure was LAN Shang.</p><p>This was something that Lu Ming and the blue merchant had discussed long ago. When the time was right, the blue merchant would appear and reveal the projection to the public.</p><p>“LAN Shang, it’s you!”</p><p>Upon seeing LAN Shang, the heads of the Jin, winged man, and Qin families couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise. It was obvious that they all knew LAN Shang.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you surprised to see me?”</p><p>LAN Shang said indifferently.</p><p>“Who is this kid to you? You want to protect him?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family asked coldly.</p><p>LAN Shang used to be Jing Yu’s teacher. In the entire great void Holy dynasty, he was a high and mighty figure. His status was much higher than that of the three clan heads.</p><p>But now, they didn’t need to be afraid of LAN Shang. He was just a person who had been demoted!</p><p>“Lu Ming is my son-in-law. Can’t I?”</p><p>LAN Shang said indifferently.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Many people were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually the son-in-law of the blue merchant?</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose, feeling rather speechless.</p><p>Did this guy really want to sell his daughter to him? He actually said that Lu Ming was his son-in-law in public.</p><p>However, under such circumstances, Lu Ming could not deny it. He could only keep quiet.</p><p>“The evidence you want is in my hands!”</p><p>LAN Shang added.</p><p>Many people’s eyes fell on LAN Shang.</p><p>Did LAN Shang really have the evidence of the nine absolute divine crystal being stolen?</p><p>If that was the case, it was definitely a big matter. Everyone was extremely curious.</p><p>“Then take it out!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said calmly.</p><p>Lu Ming and LAN Shang were a little puzzled. The other party was so calm. Could it be that they had guessed wrong?</p><p>Or was he really holding on?</p><p>At this time, there was no way out. It was up to whoever could keep their cool.</p><p>of course, but this is a big deal. Before I show the evidence, I want to invite the Heavenly King divine guards to be a witness!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>He wanted to invite the Heavenly King divine guards!</p><p>Some people’s expressions changed.</p><p>The Heavenly King divine guards were a group of guards under the direct command of the nine extremes Heavenly King. They took direct orders from the nine extremes Heavenly King and were all made up of extremely powerful existences. They also had great power and had the power to enforce the law.</p><p>If they found out that someone was the spy who stole the nine absolute God crystal, the Heavenly King divine guards could execute the law and destroy the other party.</p><p>LAN Shang was trying to put pressure on the other party. If the three aristocratic families really had a spy, they would most likely lose their cool and be extorted.</p><p>The so-called leniency to those who confess, severity to those who resist.</p><p>If he confessed first, he might be dealt with lightly.</p><p>This was human nature. LAN Shang and Lu Ming’s plan was to use strong pressure to extort the other party to expose themselves first.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll invite the Heavenly King divine guards!”</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan was the first to speak.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the Qin family head said.</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>In the end, the master of the Jin family also nodded.</p><p>This made Lu Ming and LAN Shang look at each other with a puzzled expression.</p><p>Could it be that they were wrong? the spies were not from the three aristocratic families?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
