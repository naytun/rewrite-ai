His combat strength had also improved. Naturally, it was easy for him to deal with the gold-robed young man. He could completely crush him.</p><p>After more than a dozen hits, Lu Ming controlled the ice chain and swung it, throwing the gold-robed young man away.</p><p>The gold-robed young man barely managed to stabilize himself in the air. He looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>“I already told you to get lost, but you didn’t. Why did you stay and be tortured? Why bother?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man was so angry that he spat out another mouthful of blood. He used his movement technique and left without looking back. He didn’t even compete for the other stone platforms. He was really too embarrassed.</p><p>After beating up the gold-robed young man, Lu Ming continued to sit cross-legged and wait.</p><p>A day later, a layer of light enveloped Lu Ming and he continued to cultivate.</p><p>Time flew by, and another three months passed.</p><p>In the past three months, Lu Ming’s degree of awakening of his ruler’s divine power had reached 99%.</p><p>However, it stopped after it reached 99%.</p><p>The degree of awakening had reached ninety-nine percent. The next step was to completely awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>However, this step was extremely difficult.</p><p>One step away, and they were worlds apart!</p><p>Many people were stuck at this step for their entire lives.</p><p>It was not that easy for Lu Ming to make a breakthrough.</p><p>continue cultivating. I don’t believe that I can’t break through!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. He would continue cultivating after a day. This time, no one challenged Lu Ming.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three months had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been cultivating here for one and a half years.</p><p>After three months of cultivation, Lu Ming’s understanding of the ruler’s divine power had deepened. However, the degree of awakening was still at ninety-nine percent.</p><p>He continued cultivating.</p><p>After that, no one challenged Lu Ming.</p><p>Three months, and another three months.</p><p>Finally, after two years of cultivation, Lu Ming had a breakthrough.</p><p>The chief sovereign’s divine power had finally awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Once the origin divine power factor was awakened, the divine power seemed to undergo a qualitative change. The divine power was filled with a strange factor that made the power of the divine power extremely terrifying.</p><p>If the chief sovereign’s divine power from before was like rotten wood, then the chief sovereign’s divine power now was like steel.</p><p>He was much stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming felt it carefully and was overjoyed.</p><p>It was no wonder prodigies who had awakened the origin divine power factor had such terrifying battle power. For example, LAN Ling’s battle power was so strong that he could definitely suppress a Godking like the night Demon King.</p><p>“With my current combat strength, it should be easy for me to defeat Qin Wukong. I should be able to suppress a Godking like the night Devil King!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>The three-month period was up again. Lu Ming opened his eyes and felt refreshed.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>At this moment, he felt his back jump up slightly, and a cold killing intent enveloped him.</p><p>Previously, he was also shrouded in killing intent. However, Lu Ming did not have much of a reaction because the owner of the killing intent was not a threat to him.</p><p>However, this time, Lu Ming’s body had a natural reaction. This meant that the owner who emitted the killing intent was a threat to him.</p><p>Lu Ming turned to look.</p><p>“Gold ingot!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>He saw Jin Xing, Jin Yuan, and the others outside the stone platform.</p><p>The killing intent that made his body tense up was from Jin Yuan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, very good. You dare to kill the Jin clan’s prodigy. Very good!”</p><p>Jin Yuan said coldly when he saw Lu Ming looking at him. He did not hide his cold killing intent at all.</p><p>On the side, many people kept their distance from Jin Yuan.</p><p>Jin Yuan was an existence who had awakened the origin divine power factor. His strength was terrifying, and no one could stop him when he was in a frenzy.</p><p>“Jin family’s trash, I’ve even invited you here. However, I don’t have time to fight with you now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>He still had a year’s time.</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ming turned his head and stopped paying attention to Jin Yuan.</p><p>Hmph, the three-year period will be over soon. If you don’t dare to come out now, let’s see how you’ll hide after the three-year period is over. I’ll wait for you here!</p><p>Gold ingot said coldly.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lu Ming left this sentence and did not speak anymore.</p><p>This made Jin Yuan’s gaze even colder.</p><p>“Lu Ming is in danger. I didn’t expect that Jin Xing would invite Jin Yuan!”</p><p>it’s indeed dangerous. Lu Ming should have left earlier. He was too greedy. He occupied the first row and wanted to cultivate for three years. He’s going to lose his life now!</p><p>Some people were discussing in low voices.</p><p>No one thought that Lu Ming could fight against Jin Yuan.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was powerful, there was not much of a difference between him and Qin Wukong. At most, he was slightly stronger than Qin Wukong.</p><p>However, Jin Yuan was an existence who had awakened the origin divine power factor. His battle prowess was definitely much stronger than Qin Wukong’s.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming continued to cultivate, he would not be Jin Yuan’s match.</p><p>Unless Lu Ming had also awakened the origin divine power factor. However, was this possible?</p><p>Lu Ming was only a fifth-level celestial deity. Before he came here, his degree of awakening was definitely not high.</p><p>It was impossible for him to awaken the divine power factor in three years.</p><p>Every time, many geniuses would enter star-moon ancient city, and many people would cultivate in myriad God cliff. Many people were aware of the effects of cultivating in myriad God cliff.</p><p>Although the effect was much better than training outside, it was almost impossible to awaken the origin divine power factor in one training session.</p><p>For people like Jin Yuan who had awakened the origin divine power factor, it was only after they had entered this place to cultivate and left star-moon ancient city that they had successfully awakened it after a long period of accumulation.</p><p>There were very few people in history who succeeded in their awakening after one cultivation session, let alone Lu Ming who was only a fifth-level celestial deity.</p><p>Without awakening the origin divine power factor, how could he be Jin Yuan’s match?</p><p>Therefore, many people felt that Lu Ming was in danger.</p><p>Some people had wanted to leave, but now, they stayed.</p><p>They wanted to see what would happen to Lu Ming, this unparalleled genius.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to think too much. A day later, he entered the state of cultivation and entered the starry sky again.</p><p>now that I’ve successfully awakened the ruler’s divine power, it’s impossible for me to make a major breakthrough in a short time if I continue to comprehend it. I’d better comprehend other divine powers!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The first awakening was equivalent to the first Firmament of divine power, but it was extremely difficult to reach the second firmament, ten times more difficult than the first awakening.</p><p>It was impossible for him to break through in a short period of time. Therefore, Lu Ming decided to study another kind of divine energy.</p><p>After some consideration, Lu Ming decided to study the inextinguishable sword force.</p><p>The inextinguishable sword force was mainly for attacking. If he could successfully awaken it, it would greatly increase Lu Ming’s offensive power.</p><p>Of course, he had to first find the origin divine power that corresponded to the inextinguishable sword force.</p><p>Lu Ming shuttled through the starry sky in search of the origin divine energy corresponding to the inextinguishable sword force.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
