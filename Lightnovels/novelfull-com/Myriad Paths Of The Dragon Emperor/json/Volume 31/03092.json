This was great news to him. Of course, he agreed without hesitation.</p><p>“This time, it’s not just you guys. All the forces in the Qin heaven star system who have a grudge against Lu Ming will be involved. When the time comes, Lu Ming will definitely die with a thunderous blow!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p>This time, the Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family had sent many youths to the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>They knew that the Wu family would definitely be keeping an eye on the experts of the few major aristocratic families. It was obviously inconvenient to send experts to the Qin heaven Star Zone to kill Lu Ming. After all, they had to go through the teleportation array.</p><p>However, the woo family could not keep an eye on the youths below Divine King realm from the great families.</p><p>There were too many youths from the aristocratic families. Furthermore, these youths spent most of their time travelling and tempering themselves outside. It was too easy for them to go anywhere they wanted.</p><p>Therefore, a few major families had sent some youths to the Qin heaven star system to communicate with the forces that had grudges with Lu Ming and to kill him in secret.</p><p>.com</p><p>How could they let Lu Ming obtain the nine ultimate divine crystal so easily? they could not let him go back alive.</p><p>This was the reason why the master of the Jin family had taken a step back.</p><p>“With so many forces joining forces, Lu Ming will definitely die!”</p><p>The sect leader of the eternal sword sect said.</p><p>“Yes, of course he has to die. Also, this time, my Jin family has brought you a reward!”</p><p>Then, a Jade bottle appeared in the young man’s hand.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>The sect master of the undying sword sect was puzzled.</p><p>there’s a King breakthrough pill in here. Your cultivation is at the third level of the Godking realm, right? after you consume it, you’ll be able to break through to the fourth level of the Godking realm in a short period of time!</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said.</p><p>“What? It can help me break through to the fourth level of Godking realm!”</p><p>The sect leader of the indestructible sword sect exclaimed. Then, he stared at the Jade bottle in the hands of the young man from the Jin family with a burning gaze.</p><p>If not for the other party’s status, he would have snatched it.</p><p>He had broken through to the fourth level of Godking realm!</p><p>He almost jumped up, his face red with excitement.</p><p>It was too difficult to break through to the divine King realm.</p><p>&Nbsp; he had cultivated for countless years and exhausted countless treasures to reach the third level of Godking realm.</p><p>However, this was his limit. He understood that he would probably stop here in his life.</p><p>However, how could he not be excited when the young man from the Jin family’s King breakthrough pill could allow him to break through to the fourth level of the divine King realm?</p><p>In the Qin heaven star region, only the ice Soul Clan and the Scarlet Flame clan had fourth level godly King realm existences. They were the two most powerful clans in the Qin heaven star region.</p><p>And if he were to break through to the fourth level Dao Godking realm, he would immediately become an unrivaled existence in the Qin heaven star realm. His heart was already beating intensely.</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said with a disdainful smile.</p><p>This kind of ‘King breakthrough pill’, in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, not many people would use it.</p><p>It was true that the king breakthrough pill could allow one to break through one level of cultivation in a short time, but it had a huge drawback. After the breakthrough, one could forget about breaking through in the future.</p><p>To sacrifice the future in exchange for a breakthrough now, who would want to use it?</p><p>However, it was suitable for someone like the sect leader of the inextinguishable sword sect.</p><p>The people from the Jin clan and the winged people clan were well aware of Lu Ming’s strength. Lu Ming had a metallic lifeform that could kill a third level Godking.</p><p>If he were to let the sect master of the eternal sword sect and the others kill Lu Ming, they would definitely not be able to do so.</p><p>However, if these people were to break through to the fourth tier of the divine King realm, then they would have a great chance of killing Lu Ming.</p><p>“Take it and make the best use of the time to break through!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family passed the Jade bottle to the sect leader of the undying sword sect. The sect leader trembled as he received the bottle and expressed his gratitude.</p><p>The other elders of the indestructible sword sect all looked envious.</p><p>The young man from the Jin family sneered in his heart. Naturally, he did not tell the inextinguishable sword sect about Lu Ming’s true strength.</p><p>If he told these people, they would feel fear in their hearts. When they attacked, they would not be so decisive.</p><p>As for whether these people would be killed by Lu Ming, he could not be bothered. In his eyes, these people were all trash. If they died, so be it. What did it have to do with him? As long as he could kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“This time, if you do well, my Jin family will not treat you badly!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin clan made an empty promise and left the eternal sword sect.</p><p>At the same time, youths from the boundless Holy Land, the unique demon Academy, and the Scarlet Flame tribe had also arrived.</p><p>Furthermore, they had been given the ‘King breakthrough pill’ to help them achieve a breakthrough in their cultivation. They only had one goal, and that was to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not know about this. He waited quietly in the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>Not long after, the people the ice Soul clan’s clan leader had sent to the major forces responded.</p><p>“He agreed? And he said he would do his best?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned after hearing that.</p><p>that’s right. Regardless of whether it’s the Scarlet Flame clan or the undying sword sect, they all agreed to send people to kill the dark ice Clan and take back the nine absolute divine crystal. The reason they gave was for the safety of the Qin heaven Star Zone!</p><p>that’s strange. I thought they wouldn’t be so straightforward!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan frowned in confusion.</p><p>I don’t care what tricks they’re playing. I’ll deal with them as they come. Perhaps they’re really doing this for the safety of the Qin heaven star system. If they don’t get the nine absolute divine crystal back, they’ll die a thousand years later!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not believe that the other party would agree so readily. He reckoned that there must be something fishy going on. However, he had the bone demon. What was there to be afraid of?</p><p>I hope so. I’ll start gathering the experts and head to planet thousand spirits!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and left the ice Soul Clan to return to the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Speed was the most important thing in war. A month later, the experts of the Qin heaven thirteen clans, the red flame clan, and the ice Soul Clan gathered on myriad spirit planet. There were many experts.</p><p>“The ice Soul Clan is familiar with the dark ice clan’s territory. You can lead the way this time!”</p><p>The clan leader of the red flame clan said to the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan nodded. Then, the experts set off.</p><p>They took the teleportation formation to an area not far from the ice Soul Clan. Then they all took the space battleships and rushed toward the dark ice Soul clan’s hideout.</p><p>One by one, the starships streaked across the starry sky in a dazzling display.</p><p>Not long after, a Galaxy appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>From afar, this Galaxy looked extremely strange.</p><p>The light of the star of this solar system was very dim, as if it was about to be extinguished. However, some of the planets around the star were snow-white.</p><p>From afar, they looked like white pearls.</p><p>Even though they were far away, it was as if a terrifying chill was spreading.</p><p>“This is the dark ice clan’s hideout. They’ve set up killing formations in the entire Galaxy. It won’t be easy to break in. We need to work together!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said.</p><p>then what are we waiting for? let’s kill them!</p><p>The patriarch of the Scarlet Flame clan said.</p><p>“Alright, let’s break the formation first, then charge in!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
