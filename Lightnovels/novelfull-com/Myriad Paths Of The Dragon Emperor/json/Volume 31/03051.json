Faced with Chu baxing’s mockery, Jin Yuan clenched his fists tightly, his expression extremely dark.</p><p>“Someone actually compared you to me before. Jinyuan, you’re not even worthy of carrying my shoes!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing continued to mock.</p><p>“Hmph, Chu BA Xing, don’t be too pleased with yourself!”</p><p>Suddenly, Jin Yuan raised his head and looked at Chu baxing. He then pointed at Lu Ming and said, this person is a rare genius of my nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. His combat strength is unparalleled and he is invincible among those of the same level. No, not to mention those of the same level, even if he were to fight against those several levels higher, he would still be invincible. I admit that I am not his opponent!</p><p>so, Chu BA Xing, if you meet him, it’s best for you to surrender as well. Otherwise, you’ll lose your life!</p><p>What?</p><p>Jin Yuan’s words shocked the others.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually defeated Jin Yuan with his fifth-level celestial deity cultivation base? How was this possible?</p><p>Xu Yan, who was also from the nine absolute Heavenly Kings mansion, and the youth in the animal skin coat were both shocked. They had never heard of Lu Ming’s name before and only knew that he had passed the heaven Gate.</p><p>“Hahaha, gold ingot, are you joking? Facing a fifth level heavenly deity, I will admit defeat?”</p><p>Chu baxing laughed heartily, his eyes shifting as he continued, ” “I know, gold ingot. You’re trying to use this method to scare me and make me surrender without a fight!”</p><p>you clearly know that you are no match for me, so you want to make me surrender in such a way. Ridiculous. Truly ridiculous!</p><p>the two of you are both from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. You must have colluded and deliberately used this method to scare us. You want to get the life soul vitality stone. However, your method is too low!</p><p>His words made the others ‘eyes move, and they nodded secretly.</p><p>They also believed Chu baxing’s words and thought that Lu Ming and Jin Yuan had colluded to scare the others on purpose. They wanted to subdue the enemy without fighting and obtain the life soul vitality stone easily. However, how was this possible?</p><p>Jin Yuan’s face was gloomy, but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>His goal was not to scare the other party. He was doing this on purpose. If Lu Ming encountered Chu baxing, he could force them to fight. He was afraid that Chu baxing would also admit defeat.</p><p>In that case, Chu baxing would definitely not admit defeat unless Lu Ming admitted defeat.</p><p>Lu Ming cast an indifferent glance at Jin Yuan.</p><p>He knew exactly what Jin Yuan was thinking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered to explain. If he really encountered Chu baxing, Lu Ming would also want to get rid of him.</p><p>Previously, Chu baxing had attacked Lu Ming the moment he saw him. He was extremely overbearing.</p><p>Behind them, the Chu clan still wanted to kill Lu Ming. This had already angered Lu Ming.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming also remained silent.</p><p>This way, Chu baxing thought that he had guessed correctly and sneered, full of ridicule.</p><p>Lu Ming returned to his Lane and the fighting ring disappeared.</p><p>However, Jin Yuan didn’t leave this place. It was just that the small path under his feet had shrunk a bit, making him shorter than the others. This meant that he had lost.</p><p>However, he could still watch the battle here for the time being.</p><p>After Lu Ming and the rest retreated, two more small paths extended out and converged in the air, forming a fighting ring.</p><p>This time, one of them was you han.</p><p>As for the other person, it was the youth in animal skin from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>You Han’s figure flickered as he rushed onto the fighting stage. He looked at the youth in animal hide with fiery eyes and said,”Kid, come up and fight!”</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The fur-clad youth shook his head and admitted defeat.</p><p>If he met someone else, he might still fight them to train himself.</p><p>However, when he met you han, he immediately admitted defeat.</p><p>Outside the castle, even Chu baxing was not you Han’s match. Only after si Ji joined forces with Chu baxing did they manage to stop you han.</p><p>If he fought with you han, he would die. Why should he fight again?</p><p>“Hmph, what a piece of trash, you don’t even dare to fight!”</p><p>You han snorted coldly, slightly unhappy.</p><p>He still wanted to kill a heaven’s favorite and devour his soul.</p><p>The young man in animal hide admitted defeat. The small path under his feet shrank back to the same height as gold ingot.</p><p>You han also retreated.</p><p>After that, two more small paths met.</p><p>This time, one of them was Chu baxing, and the other was another heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“I admit defeat!: The youth glanced at Chu BA Xing and said indifferently.</p><p>As a heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion, he had fought with Chu baxing more than once and knew how powerful he was. Previously, Chu baxing had been suppressed by you han because he was restrained by you han. Moreover, if it was a life-and-death battle, Chu baxing might not lose, so he directly admitted defeat.</p><p>Chu BA Xing’s expression didn’t change. It was obvious that he had already known that his opponent would admit defeat.</p><p>Then, the fifth battle began.</p><p>This time, it was Xu Yan from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and Si Ji from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>What a coincidence. The two of them had fought outside the castle before, and there was no winner. Now, they met again.</p><p>Si Ji’s body flickered and he appeared on the fighting stage. His gaze was extremely sharp, and there was a flash of Saber Light in his eyes. He stared at Xu Yan and said,”Xu Yan, do you dare to have a life-and-death battle?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>Xu Yan stepped out and landed on the fighting ring. Instantly, a light shield covered the fighting ring.</p><p>“Very well, Xu Yan. I will step on your corpse and break into the God King realm!”</p><p>Si Ji’s battle intent soared.</p><p>“This is exactly what I wanted to say. After I kill you and leave star-moon ancient city, I will be able to break through to the divine King realm!”</p><p>Xu Yan also spoke.</p><p>Their cultivation base was at the half-step Divine King realm and they had stayed there for quite a long time. However, it was not easy to break through to the divine King realm. The requirements were very high.</p><p>Only by going through life and death battles and intense training could they break through faster.</p><p>This time, with you han, Chu baxing, Xu Yan, si Ji, and the others around, they knew that they would most likely not be able to obtain the life soul vitality stone. However, they did not give up immediately. Instead, they chose to battle to train themselves.</p><p>Of course, if the difference in strength was too great, there was no need to fight, as that would be courting death.</p><p>For example, Xu Yan and Si Ji had similar strength, so if they fought a life-and-death battle, the one who survived would truly be able to advance and complete the transformation.</p><p>That was why they chose to fight to the death.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>The formation spirit announced.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the formation spirit finished speaking, the two of them exploded, turning into two rainbow lights and colliding together.</p><p>Si Ji’s saber techniques were unparalleled, and his attack power was astonishing. He slashed out terrifying saber lights.</p><p>As for Xu Yan, his entire body was covered in a layer of stone armor. He swung his fists, and each punch was like an ancient divine mountain. It was extremely fierce and powerful.</p><p>The two of them engaged in an intense battle, and it was difficult to tell who was winning.</p><p>Compared to when they were at the castle, this was even more intense and brutal.</p><p>This was because this was a life-and-death battle. There was no way out for both sides. Only by killing the opponent could one survive.</p><p>The two of them fought madly, and towards the end, both of them were covered in blood and were seriously injured.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
