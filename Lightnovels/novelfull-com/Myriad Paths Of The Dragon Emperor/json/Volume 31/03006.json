Even Lu Ming shivered as if his body was about to be frozen.</p><p>The beautiful woman had to lay down more than ten layers of divine power around her body to block the cold.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, the ground exploded. A few vines suddenly rushed out from under Lu Ming and the beautiful woman’s feet, heading toward them.</p><p>There were a total of Four Vines. Two of them were used to deal with Lu Ming, while the other two were used to deal with the beautiful woman.</p><p>The vine was snow-white and crystal clear like jade, but it was filled with a terrifying chill.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The vines whipped in the air, making a whistling sound as they lashed at Lu Ming like a soft whip.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear with both hands and slashed continuously.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The long spear struck the vine, causing a violent tremor. Then, Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he retreated continuously. The qi and blood in his body churned and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>The surface of his body was covered in a layer of ice crystals, almost freezing his body.</p><p>He had to continuously channel his divine power to dissolve the layer of ice.</p><p>so that tree-stump like head is a vine head, but its strength is so terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was very grave.</p><p>At this moment, he could tell that the huge head that had appeared earlier was the Vine’s head.</p><p>The Vine’s strength was extremely shocking. It was definitely at the divine King realm and was even stronger than the night Demon Lord.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On the other side, the beautiful woman’s sword light continued to burst forth, cutting two vines and sending them flying.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>The vine roared and the four Vines began to dance wildly.</p><p>Each vine could change its size freely. Like a long snake, it lashed out or wrapped around the two of them.</p><p>However, this time, only one of the two vines that were originally attacking Lu Ming remained. The other one attacked the beautiful woman.</p><p>It was obvious that the absolute beauty posed a greater threat to it, so the vine used more power to deal with the absolute beauty.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you want to kill this vine and get the treasure of Absolute Frost, you have to destroy its head. Otherwise, you can’t kill it by just attacking the vine!”</p><p>The quantity formula shouted.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Lu Ming responded. He waved his long spear and exchanged a few more moves with the vines. Suddenly, Lu Ming’s body moved and he executed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to its maximum.</p><p>With a flash, he dodged the Vine’s attack and charged toward the Vine’s head.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming was not far from the vine’s head.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The vine opened its mouth wide and spat out a thick mist that gushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The temperature of the mist was shockingly low. Lu Ming was enveloped in it and he felt that his body was about to freeze. Not only his body, but his soul was also about to be frozen.</p><p>Suddenly, the ninth ice chain glowed. A layer of silver-white light enveloped Lu Ming and blocked the cold air outside.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s body shook and the ice crystals on the surface of his body shattered.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to attack the Vine’s head.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was about to get close to the Vine’s head, he was about to use the supernova to kill the vine completely. However, at this moment, the rocks around the Vine’s head exploded and five vines rushed out.</p><p>Each of the five vines was crystal clear and exuded a terrifying chill. They lashed out or wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>It turned out that this vine actually had so many vines. It was simply like an octopus.</p><p>Previously, he had only used Four Vines to attack Lu Ming and the rest. The other five vines were hidden near his head to protect it.</p><p>Once someone got close, the five vines could launch a lightning attack.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming could only try his best to resist.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard. Lu Ming circulated the divine Dragon materialization art. Seven Divine Dragon manifestations appeared and charged toward a vine.</p><p>At the same time, he brandished his spear and attacked a few vines.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of explosions rang out. The seven nine-clawed divine Dragons were instantly destroyed. Lu Ming’s body shook violently. His arms were about to explode as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>However, out of the five vines, Lu Ming could only block three of them. There was nothing he could do about the remaining two.</p><p>The remaining two sets of canes wrapped around Lu Ming.</p><p>A terrifying chill enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body, and he was immediately covered in a layer of ice.</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming roared. The divine power in his body erupted and he struggled madly, trying to break the vines.</p><p>However, the vine was extremely tough. Lu Ming exerted all his strength but not only did it not break, it tightened even more. The green scales on Lu Ming’s body were about to break.</p><p>Then, the vine pulled Lu Ming and stuffed him into its mouth. It was planning to eat him.</p><p>“This is troublesome!”</p><p>There was a trace of panic in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>The current situation was not good. His entire body was entangled and almost frozen. He had no way to resist. Although he had cultivated the moon divine power, his cultivation was still weak. He could not stop the cold from invading.</p><p>brat, don’t be afraid. Entering its mouth is our chance. We might be able to kill it!</p><p>At this moment, the ” measure ” character said.</p><p>“Enter its mouth and kill it? how? The coldness in this guy’s mouth is extremely terrifying. I’m afraid I’ll be frozen to death in an instant if I go in!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Frozen to death? how is that possible? With this old lady here, how could I let you freeze to death?”</p><p>The unhappy voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>That’s right, the chill was actually a type of energy.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula was known as the source of all energy. It could devour any kind of energy. In that case, it could also devour coldness.</p><p>As long as the ” quantity ” formula was used on Lu Ming’s surface and devoured the coldness on his pale face, he would not have to be afraid of that kind of coldness.</p><p>boy, it seems that you have thought it through. The reason why I haven’t made a move now is that I’m afraid of alerting the snake and making this vine hesitate. If that’s the case, it’ll really be difficult to kill!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s give it a shot!”</p><p>There was a hint of ruthlessness in Lu Ming’s eyes. He planned to let himself be swallowed by the vine before he launched a lightning-fast attack.</p><p>But at this moment, something changed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Streams of sword Qi shot out and slashed at the vines that were wrapped around Lu Ming, causing sparks to fly.</p><p>It was the absolute beauty. She had escaped from the three vines and was charging over.</p><p>“Only I can kill Lu Ming. No one else is qualified to kill him, including you, old vine!”</p><p>die! the absolute beauty shouted. Sword Qi filled the air, and her body was covered by a transparent sword light. Her aura was extremely shocking.</p><p>“Divine Sword Art!”</p><p>The absolute beauty waved her hand and a few hundred sword-lights slashed at the vines that wrapped around Lu Ming. However, the vines were shockingly hard and sturdy. Even with the absolute Beauty’s abilities, she could not cut them and could only leave a few white marks on them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
