If Lu Ming wants to kill Yi Xiang, he’ll definitely leave the universal camp. At that time, we’ll arrange for a few scapegoats and have a reason and opportunity to kill him!</p><p>Gold ingot replied, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Alright, let’s do that!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family laughed.</p><p>“Family head, that Lu Ming has also killed quite a few of the Qin family’s geniuses. We can get the Qin family to join us in this matter!”</p><p>Gold ingot said.</p><p>I understand. I’ll go to the winged people’s family now. You go and invite the Qin family’s experts to go and discuss it!</p><p>In the end, the head of the Jin family instructed an elder.</p><p>The elder of the Jin clan accepted the order and rushed to the Qin clan.</p><p>The head of the Jin family rushed to the winged man family.</p><p>In fact, there had been a storm brewing in the Qin family over the past two days. Several top geniuses of the Qin family had died at Lu Ming’s hands. The higher-ups of the Qin family were furious and wanted to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, the arrival of the Jin clan’s people meant that they hit it off immediately. The Qin clan’s clan master immediately set out personally and rushed to the winged people’s family to discuss how to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>In the hall of the winged man family, the experts of the three great families had gathered together just to discuss how to deal with a junior.</p><p>“What’s your plan?”</p><p>The head of the winged man clan stared at the head of the Jin clan and asked.</p><p>get Yi Xiang to leave the winged ones ‘family and travel around the world. It’s best if he can lure Lu Ming to kill him in a crowded place. Once he does, we’ll have a hundred reasons to kill him. Even the universal camp can’t protect him!</p><p>The master of the Jin family said coldly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan slammed the table heavily. He stared at the clan head of the Jin clan with an unkind gaze and said,”You mean to say that we should sacrifice my son, Yixiang, and let Lu Ming kill him?”</p><p>haha, brother Yi, you’ve misunderstood. Of course not. Young master Yi Xiang is just a bait. You can arrange for experts to protect young master Yi Xiang. Then, arrange for a few unimportant people to be killed by Lu Ming. That will do!</p><p>The head of the Jin family laughed.</p><p>that’s more like it. That brat is bent on killing my son. We have to get rid of him as soon as possible!</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan nodded.</p><p>The three patriarchs immediately began to discuss the details.</p><p>Lu Ming had no idea about all this.</p><p>For the next ten days or so, Lu Ming focused on comprehending the ‘Overlord spear technique’ and finally made great progress.</p><p>He had successfully cultivated the first level of the Overlord spear technique. Next, he just had to slowly cultivate it.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out the Wargod strike and read it in detail.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed. He ended his comprehension and a voice transmission jade talisman appeared in his hand.</p><p>Earlier, he had only ended his cultivation when he felt someone had sent him a voice transmission.</p><p>“Yixiang, we have news!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up when he used his spiritual senses to scan the voice transmission jade talisman.</p><p>It was Wu Ming who had sent him the message.</p><p>Previously, he had asked Wu Ming and the others to find out more about soaring wing, and now he had finally found out.</p><p>Lu Ming left the courtyard. As expected, he saw Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and Wu zixiong outside the door.</p><p>“Brothers woo, where is Yi Xiang? You’re back at the universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>No. Wu Ming shook his head and said, ” we’ve found out that Yi Xiang has been cooped up in the winged people’s family for some time, but he left seven or eight days ago. He’s been moving around the soaring cloud District all this time!</p><p>“Soaring cloud region!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>After coming to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, Lu Ming naturally did some research on the mansion.</p><p>The entire planet was the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, which was extremely vast.</p><p>However, the top was also divided into different areas.</p><p>For example, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s core King mansion area and the various aristocratic family headquarters area.</p><p>Other than that, there were also some areas where ordinary people gathered or commercial areas for consumption.</p><p>The soaring cloud District was a commercial district. There were restaurants, markets, auction houses, and brothels there. It was extremely prosperous.</p><p>It was also the area with the most people.</p><p>“Brother Lu, that Yi Xiang has been cooped up in the winged people’s family and didn’t dare to come out. Then, he suddenly appeared in the soaring cloud District and swaggered in and out of various restaurants and brothels all day long. I’m afraid there’s a trap. We can’t act rashly!”</p><p>Wu zixiong said with a frown.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>He had also thought of this.</p><p>He wanted to kill Yi Xiang but Lu Ming had many enemies. Perhaps, the other party wanted to kill him too.</p><p>However, in the universal camp, it was not easy for the other party to make a move. Perhaps they wanted to lure him out and then kill him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly as he thought of a countermeasure.</p><p>He had to kill Yi Xiang. If he didn’t, he wouldn’t be able to breathe.</p><p>However, it all depended on how he killed them.</p><p>how about this? let’s wait and observe the situation first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He was not an impulsive person. He knew that there might be a conspiracy, but he still stupidly killed his way over.</p><p>that’s great. If anything happens, we’ll inform you immediately!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Thank you, everyone!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>“You’re welcome. Lu Ming, the Wu family head already knows about your situation. He said that if you need any help, feel free to ask. The Wu family will definitely do our best to help you!”</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>“The Wu family’s head?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. He did not expect that the Wu family’s family head had heard about his matter. Perhaps Wu Zifeng had a part to play in this.</p><p>“Please help me thank family head Wu. If anything happens to Lu Ming, I won’t be polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>After that, Wu Ming and the others took their leave.</p><p>After Wu Ming and the rest left, Lu Ming was about to return to his room when a figure stepped through the air from the direction of Star Peak’s peak. He was as graceful as a celestial being. Who else could it be but an Indigo spirit?</p><p>“What are you doing here? Didn’t you learn enough from the last lesson?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at LAN Ling and said coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>LAN Ling’s chest heaved up and down in anger. She had never been so unpopular before.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you think I wanted to come here? it’s my father who wants to see you!”</p><p>LAN Ling said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Senior LAN Shang, could it be?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>Could it be that the blue merchant had already found a clue from the night Devil King’s storage ring?</p><p>“I’ve already sent the message. It’s up to you whether you want to come or not!”</p><p>After LAN Ling finished speaking, she turned around and left like a proud Swan.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He could not be bothered with LAN Ling and followed her.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to the garden where the blue merchant lived for the second time.</p><p>“Senior, did you find me because you have a clue about the nine absolute God crystal?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to ask the blue merchant as soon as he saw him.</p><p>“That’s right, we have a clue!”</p><p>that’s right! LAN Shang smiled. Night Demon Lord, sealing a projection into an ordinary divine weapon is a good move!</p><p>After saying that, he looked at his hand and an ancient axe appeared.</p><p>This axe was just an ordinary high quality divine weapon.</p><p>“Sealed in this axe?”</p><p>Lu Ming was surprised.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
