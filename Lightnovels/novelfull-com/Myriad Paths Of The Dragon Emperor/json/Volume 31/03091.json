Even with bone demon’s abilities, he could only recover to the peak of the God King realm.</p><p>it’s fine to use it for the time being. After all, it’s not very useful. It’ll have to be changed in the future!</p><p>Bone muttered.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was already very satisfied.</p><p>With the bone demon’s current strength, it would be much easier for Lu Ming to get things done with his help.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, I’ve come this time to ask for your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming then told him about the dark ice Clan and the nine absolute divine crystal.</p><p>“Sure. Just let me know when you’re leaving.”</p><p>Bone said.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Logically speaking, there was no need to use such an expert like the bone Devil to deal with the dark ice Race this time. However, Lu Ming felt that things would not be so simple this time. He would let the bone Devil follow him as a precaution.</p><p>Lu Ming took his leave and headed to the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>After arriving at the ice Soul Clan, Lu Ming was immediately welcomed by the clan leader.</p><p>“How is it, nephew Lu Ming? is there any news about the nine ultimate divine crystal?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan asked impatiently as soon as they met.</p><p>“There it is!”</p><p>“The nine ultimate divine crystal is indeed with the dark ice Clan!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“It’s true, I was right!”</p><p>The eyes of the ice Soul clan’s patriarch lit up.</p><p>however, something happened to me at the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. This time, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion won’t send anyone to help us. They want us to deal with the dark ice Clan by ourselves, take back the nine absolute divine crystal, and hand it over to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion …</p><p>Lu Ming briefly explained the matter of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming skipped over some of the things that he should not say.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>“The ice Soul Clan will do our best to deal with the dark ice Clan, but …” The clan leader nodded.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan pondered for a moment.</p><p>“But what?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>all these years, I’ve been sending people to keep an eye on the dark ice Clan. The dark ice Clan is hiding in a rather hidden place in the Qin heaven Galaxy. Over the years, the dark ice Clan has made that area as impenetrable as an iron bucket. In addition, the dark ice Clan is extremely powerful. It’ll be very difficult for us to destroy the dark ice Clan with just the two major forces, the ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect, working together. Even if we can destroy them, we’ll suffer heavy losses!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan said worriedly.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t know where the dark ice Clan was hiding. Quite the contrary, he had known it for a long time.</p><p>However, why had the ice Soul Clan not attacked and exterminated the dark ice Clan all these years? it was because they were not strong enough.</p><p>The dark ice Clan had set up many great formations in their hiding place. They also had many masters. Even if the ice Soul Clan was stronger as a whole, they would lose a lot of strength to destroy the dark ice Clan. This would give the Scarlet Flame clan a chance.</p><p>This was the reason why the ice Soul Clan had not attacked the dark ice Clan.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan had the same worry.</p><p>don’t worry. This matter concerns the safety of the qintian star system. The other forces can’t stay out of it. The Scarlet Flame tribe, the three overlords, and other forces will all send people to battle!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy to get them to send people out to fight!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan sighed.</p><p>“Send someone to inform them first. If they don’t send anyone to fight, we’ll think about it later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch nodded. This was the only plan they had.</p><p>Immediately, the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan sent out emissaries to all the major forces to inform them to send their experts to fight. They would eliminate the dark ice Clan together and take back the nine absolute divine crystal to ensure the safety of the Qin Tian Starfield.</p><p>Lu Ming was waiting at the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>……</p><p>At this moment, all the major forces had uninvited guests.</p><p>In a large hall of the eternal sword sect, the sect leader led the experts of the sect to welcome a young man.</p><p>This young man was dressed in a golden robe. He stood in the middle of the hall with his hands behind his back and an arrogant expression on his face.</p><p>He was clearly only a heavenly God, yet he acted as if he didn’t care about God kings like the sect master of the eternal sword sect.</p><p>If Lu Ming was here, he would definitely be able to tell that this young man was from the Jin family of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Greetings to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s envoy!”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others saluted the young man from the Jin family respectfully.</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>The young man waved his hand and said, ” just say it. I am here for the nine absolute divine crystal!</p><p>emissary, didn’t you say that the nine absolute God Crystal’s time limit is in a thousand years? it’s not time yet!</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others were all shocked.</p><p>“Let me finish!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family’s face darkened, and the sect master of the eternal sword sect and the others did not dare to say anything.</p><p>there’s a person called Lu Ming in your Qin heaven star system. He came to my nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to investigate the nine absolute divine crystal …</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Hearing this, the sect master of the eternal sword sect and the others ‘expressions changed again, and killing intent flashed in their eyes.</p><p>“This Lu Ming has found out about the whereabouts of the nine absolute divine crystal. The nine absolute divine crystal is in the hands of a clan called the dark ice Clan in your Qin Tian Starfield!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin clan continued, while the sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others were surprised.</p><p>They had never thought that the nine absolute divine crystal was in the hands of the dark ice Clan.</p><p>however, this Lu Ming is extremely audacious and lawless. In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, he offended a Big Shot. Hence, this time, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sent Lu Ming back to take back the nine absolute God crystal. However, the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion will definitely not send anyone to help him.</p><p>“However, I reckon that Lu Ming will look for the local forces of the Qin heaven Star Zone to help him get back the nine absolute divine crystal!”</p><p>The young man from the Jin family said.</p><p>After hearing this, the sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>After a while, the sect master of the eternal sword sect said, ” don’t worry, emissary. I know what to do. I, the immortal sword sect, will not send a single soldier to help Lu Ming and let him fail his mission …</p><p>He had thought that the young man from the Jin family came to warn him not to send anyone to help Lu Ming.</p><p>This was exactly what he wanted. He did not want to send people to help Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, no,…”</p><p>“I mean, not only do you have to send them, but you also have to send all your experts!” The young man from Jin family shook his head.</p><p>“Ah? This?”</p><p>The sect master of the eternal sword sect and the others were confused.</p><p>Could it be that this Messenger was helping Lu Ming?</p><p>But then, the young man from Jin family changed his tone and said, ” “All of you must send out all your experts. When we get the nine absolute divine crystal back, all of you will find an opportunity to attack and kill Lu Ming. Do you understand?”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others were shocked. They finally understood what the young man from the Jin family meant.</p><p>The other party wanted them to pretend to cooperate and look for an opportunity to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>The other party’s real purpose was to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Understood. Don’t worry, emissary. We’ll definitely do our best to kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect bowed and replied, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
