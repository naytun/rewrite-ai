She didn’t attack immediately, but her aura became stronger.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go, let’s go!”</p><p>The white-haired youth said. Although he was extremely unhappy, he didn’t dare to fight the absolute beauty, even though there were five of them and he was a half-step Divine King.</p><p>As half-step divine kings, there was a huge difference between those who had awakened the origin divine power factor and those who had. Even if the five of them worked together, they would not be a match for the absolute beauty.</p><p>Therefore, even though he was furious, he could only grit his teeth and avoid it.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming called out to the white-haired young man and the rest.</p><p>“What are you doing?” The white-haired young man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>brothers, don’t leave. Help me deal with this crazy woman. As long as you help me, I’ll give you all the treasures I have!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“All the treasures?”</p><p>The white-haired young man and the others were stunned for a moment, and a trace of fire flashed in their eyes.</p><p>They were indeed tempted by the treasures on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, when their gazes fell on the absolute beauty, they hesitated. Dealing with the absolute beauty would be life-threatening.</p><p>The white-haired youth’s eyes turned, and he finally decided to give up. Although the treasure was important, how could it be more important than his own life?</p><p>Therefore, the white-haired young man decided to refuse.</p><p>However, the absolute beauty didn’t give him the chance.</p><p>“If you still want to join forces against me, then I’ll kill you all as well!”</p><p>die! the beautiful woman shouted coldly. She brandished her sword, shooting out beams of sword light.</p><p>The sword-light enveloped Lu Ming, the white-haired young man, and the others.</p><p>“What are you doing? Damn it, you crazy woman …”</p><p>The white-haired young man roared. He opened his mouth and let out a long roar. His body expanded rapidly and actually turned into a huge white Lion.</p><p>This was the divine beast, the snow Lion!</p><p>Not only him, but the other young men also transformed into snow lions.</p><p>It turned out that the white-haired young man and the others were not humans, but the family of the frost Lion, a divine beast.</p><p>They transformed into their true forms and unleashed their full strength. They opened their mouths and roared, sending out waves of icy air currents that attacked the absolute beauty.</p><p>The white-haired young man was furious. He had planned to retreat, but the absolute beauty suddenly attacked him. He could only defend with all his strength.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The area was constantly exploding, and the force was overflowing.</p><p>“This is. good opportunity …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he transformed into his ancient God Body.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. A ray of spear light rushed toward the beautiful woman and exploded, colliding with the beautiful woman’s sword light in a terrifying manner.</p><p>With the help of this force, Lu Ming’s body retreated rapidly. He then cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and charged forward madly.</p><p>“This woman’s brain is indeed not very good …”</p><p>The moment he rushed out, such a thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>In fact, through the previous few times, Lu Ming realized that although the absolute beauty was powerful and had amazing talents, she did not have many schemes and thoughts.</p><p>To put it bluntly, it was pure!</p><p>Yes, she was pure. Not only pure, but also proud!</p><p>That was why she fell for their tricks time and time again. Just now, Lu Ming had only pretended to invite the white-haired young man and the rest to attack together. The absolute beauty attacked them without thinking.</p><p>The main reason was that he was simple-minded and thought that the white-haired youth and the others would really attack.</p><p>The other reason was her pride. She was very confident in her own strength and believed that she could deal with the white-haired young man and the others.</p><p>Lu Ming had seized the opportunity.</p><p>“Pervert, die …”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had run away again, the absolute beauty was furious. She abandoned the white-haired young man and the others and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>One chasing and one escaping, they disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving the white-haired young man and the others looking at each other.</p><p>“Who is this crazy woman? Why haven’t I seen him before?”</p><p>to think that there’s such a beautiful and talented person in the universal camp. Looks like I’ll have to pay more attention to her in the future!</p><p>there must be a secret on Lu Ming. Otherwise, the Jin and Qin families wouldn’t want to kill him. Hmph, I hope that he’s lucky and doesn’t die in the hands of that woman. He won’t be so lucky the next time he meets us!</p><p>The white-haired youth and the others chatted for a while before leaving.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to the extreme. His divine power boiled and condensed into a kun Peng. The kun Peng’s wings flapped rapidly. With every flap, Lu Ming flew hundreds of miles away.</p><p>However, the absolute beauty was even faster. She transformed into a sword light and streaked through the air. Her speed was even faster than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>This was also due to the presence of the cold nether energy. Otherwise, the absolute Beauty’s speed would be even more astonishing and Lu Ming would not be able to escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t even think about using the dire beast to get rid of me this time. I won’t be fooled again!”</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted. At the thought of how Lu Ming had escaped time and time again, she was very upset and her killing intent grew stronger.</p><p>beauty, beauty, why do you have to chase me? I have a wife!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“It’s because you have a wife, you deserve to die even more!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said coldly.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood. He staggered and almost fell.</p><p>What do you mean you deserve to die more because you have a wife?</p><p>Why did her words sound like she was jealous? however, Lu Ming had never seen this woman before!</p><p>beauty, are you secretly in love with me, but you found out that I have a wife, so you can’t have me, so you want to kill me? you can’t have such a thought, it’s too perverted!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>“Nonsense, who likes you? don’t think too much!”</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s expression turned even colder.</p><p>“Then why do you still want to chase me? Why do you have to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was really speechless.</p><p>I’m going to kill you! Why do I have so many reasons? die!</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted and a sword light slashed out. Lu Ming dodged it by a hair’s breadth and was almost seriously injured.</p><p>This woman really wanted to kill him. She wasn’t just saying it. She didn’t show any mercy.</p><p>Lu Ming was completely confused now. Even with his intelligence, he could not guess the purpose of the beautiful woman.</p><p>If she had been sent by the Jin and Qin families, or by forces that had colluded with the dark ice Clan, the beautiful woman would not have saved Lu Ming when the white-haired young man and the others wanted to kill him.</p><p>What was the difference between her killing herself and being killed?</p><p>However, the absolute beauty wanted to chase away the white-haired young man and the rest and kill Lu Ming with her own hands.</p><p>No matter how she looked at it, she looked like a resentful wife who had been let down.</p><p>“Beauty, did you get the wrong person?”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming shouted helplessly.</p><p>“I won’t be mistaken. Your name is Lu Ming and you came from the Qin heaven star system. The person I want to kill is you!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only fly at full speed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
