The scene was terrifying to the extreme.</p><p>A peak Divine King expert truly had the power to destroy the world and a life planet. Once he made his move, it was too terrifying.</p><p>He had used a terrifying killing move against a man with a crippled star core. He wanted to kill LAN Shang completely.</p><p>However, in the face of this attack, LAN Shang’s expression was calm. The space between his brows glowed, and a brilliant light spread out. It actually formed runes. These runes interweaved with each other and formed a combat sword.</p><p>The Battle Sword broke through the air and slashed out, stunning time.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>.com</p><p>The Battle Sword and the void-breaking hand of the Jin family head collided, and an earth-shaking boom was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword kept shaking, and the endless sword Qi slashed toward the master of the Jin family.</p><p>The body of the Jin family’s master trembled violently. He was pushed back like a meteorite for thousands of miles. His face was extremely ugly.</p><p>He was actually forced to retreat by a man whose star core had been destroyed.</p><p>the power of the soul? how can your soul be so powerful? ”</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted angrily.</p><p>Just now, LAN Shang had not used divine power, but soul power.</p><p>However, how could a person’s soul power be so powerful? To be able to force back a peak Divine King.</p><p>“So What if I don’t have Shen power to deal with you?”</p><p>LAN Shang said indifferently.</p><p>I don’t believe it. Void severing hand, void severing sword!</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted and used both of his unique skills.</p><p>The Golden combat sword cut through the air, and the Golden Palm cut toward LAN Shang like a heavenly blade.</p><p>The two attacks were aimed at LAN Shang’s two vital points. The power of the attacks was shocking.</p><p>The void-breaking hand and the void-breaking sword were both 108000 times stronger than Jin Yuan’s.</p><p>However, LAN Shang’s expression was calm. His glabella glowed and his soul power surged out. It condensed into runes and then turned into a combat sword. He slashed out several times in succession.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a few more moves, but the result was that the master of the Jin family was completely suppressed. He kept retreating, and the golden light on his body dimmed.</p><p>With his hands behind his back, LAN Shang stepped forward, revealing his peerless magnificence.</p><p>“Don’t you all want to attack? then attack together!”</p><p>As LAN Shang’s voice rang out, countless runes transformed into a huge palm that grabbed at the winged man clan’s patriarch.</p><p>He wanted to fight one against two!</p><p>A person with a crippled star core was going to fight two peak divine kings alone.</p><p>If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe.</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan let out a long howl. With a flap of his wings, Thunder rumbled and endless Thunderbolts blasted towards the large hand condensed by LAN Shang.</p><p>However, as the huge hand pressed down, endless lightning annihilated it. The terrifying palm force sent the winged man clan’s clan head flying.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Then, LAN Shang took a step forward and stepped on the void. The void trembled madly and endless runes condensed into two big hands. One of them was aimed at the master of the Jin family and the other at the master of the winged man family.</p><p>The two patriarchs roared and used all their strength to resist.</p><p>However, even if the two of them joined forces, they were still no match for him and were completely suppressed.</p><p>After withstanding a few moves, the two of them were hit by the giant hand. Their bodies were sent flying thousands of miles away. Their bodies trembled and they spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They had suffered heavy injuries.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>Many people at the scene gasped as they looked at the figure standing in the air with his hands behind his back. They were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>A person whose star core had been destroyed was able to severely injure two patriarchs with just his soul power. What kind of combat power was this?</p><p>If his star core wasn’t destroyed, how strong would he be?</p><p>Everyone seemed to be able to see LAN Shang’s unparalleled glory in the past.</p><p>Back then, Jing Yu had appeared out of nowhere with unparalleled talent.</p><p>At such a young age, he rose to power and became one of the most powerful cultivators in the great void Holy dynasty. He suppressed the other princes and even the Crown Prince.</p><p>At that time, Jing Yu’s teacher was also a peerless talent with unfathomable strength.</p><p>At that time, many people thought that Jing Yu would become the Holy Emperor of the great void Holy dynasty in the future. That was why LAN Shang was called the ‘Imperial teacher’.</p><p>Originally, after so many years had passed and LAN Shang’s star core had been destroyed, many people had almost forgotten about this person. They had thought that he would fall into silence and disappear forever in the long river of history.</p><p>He had never expected that LAN Shang’s soul alone would be so terrifying.</p><p>“I’ll definitely protect Lu Ming. What are you going to use to kill him?”</p><p>LAN Shang said disdainfully as he stared at the Jin family’s master and the others.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Jin clan and the patriarch of the winged man clan roared in their hearts.</p><p>The two great families both had existences that surpassed godkings, but there were very, very few of them. They were all old antiques that had lived for a very long time and were focused on seclusion.</p><p>If they invited such a person just to deal with a junior at the heavenly God Realm, they would really be laughed at.</p><p>Today, with the blue merchant around, they could not kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Commander Wang, this Lu Ming killed many experts from my Jin clan, the winged people’s family, and the Qin family in broad daylight. He’s so insane that he must be punished!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family suddenly cupped his hands at the commander of the Heavenly King divine guards.</p><p>that’s right. My son, Yi Xiang, was drinking here and was killed by this man for no reason. He must pay with his life!</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan added.</p><p>They could not deal with the blue merchant by themselves, so they could only ask the Heavenly King divine guards.</p><p>The Heavenly King divine guards had the responsibility to protect the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. This place was also part of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, so the Heavenly King divine guards naturally had the power to interfere.</p><p>Commander Wang frowned and looked at Lu Ming.”Is there such a thing?”</p><p>we’ve tried to kill me and Yi Xiang many times before. They almost killed my wife. I’m just taking revenge!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bullsh * t, it’s all nonsense. All of this is nonsense. When did my Jin family want to kill him? he is the one who is trying to frame us. He even slandered us and said that we were the spies who stole the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted. He had completely pushed aside his intention to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>the head of the family actually said such words. How shameless!</p><p>Lu Ming mocked.</p><p>“A life for a life! Commander Wang, please enforce the law!” The master of the Jin family said with a gloomy face.</p><p>As long as the Heavenly King divine guards intervened, no matter how strong LAN Shang was, it would be useless.</p><p>The Heavenly King divine guards were filled with experts, and there were even existences that surpassed the divine King realm. Although LAN Shang was strong, he had not reached the level of surpassing the divine King realm.</p><p>“If that’s the case, Lu Ming, you’ll have to come with us!”</p><p>Commander Wang’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the Wu family’s head was heard.</p><p>“Wu family head, you have something to say?”</p><p>Commander Wang said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
