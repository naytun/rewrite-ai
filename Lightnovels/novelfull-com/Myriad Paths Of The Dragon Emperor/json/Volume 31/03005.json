He circulated his divine energy and the ninth heaven Kunpeng that he had condensed became more solid.</p><p>At this critical moment, the nine heavenly kun Peng technique actually broke through and reached the eighth level!</p><p>Originally, Lu Ming had cultivated the incomplete nine heavenly kun Peng technique to the peak of the seventh stage. Later on, he obtained the complete version of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. After cultivating it for a period of time, he was able to achieve a breakthrough naturally under the high concentration he had.</p><p>The moment he broke through to the eighth level of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, Lu Ming’s speed had increased greatly.</p><p>The Kunpeng flapped its wings and Lu Ming’s speed increased rapidly, covering a thousand miles in an instant. In an instant, Lu Ming’s speed was not any slower than the absolute beauty.</p><p>“Eh? I’ve broken through!”</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s eyes narrowed. Divine power surged wildly, turning into a beam of sword light. She moved forward like lightning, but she could not catch up with Lu Ming. The two of them maintained a certain distance.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>The two of them flew deeper and deeper into the dark frost forbidden grounds. However, the absolute beauty continued to pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>“This crazy woman, what kind of deep hatred do I have with her?!”</p><p>Being chased, Lu Ming was furious.</p><p>He couldn’t continue like this. Although he had the quantity formula, which had an endless supply of Shen power and could maintain it for a long time, if this continued, he wouldn’t have time to find the cold treasures. He would be delayed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, there’s an extremely strong fluctuation of cold energy ahead!”</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>the fluctuation of the ultimate cold energy? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he continued flying.</p><p>After flying for a while, the coldness in front of them became even more intense. The cold Qi was pressing and the cold Qi was like mist.</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming saw an underground crack. It was huge, hundreds of miles long and dozens of miles wide.</p><p>The dense cold nether energy was coming from the underground crack.</p><p>“There it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of a plan that might be able to get rid of the beautiful woman.</p><p>The frosty Qi in the underground crack was so dense that it would be a good use to get rid of the beautiful woman.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed toward the underground crack.</p><p>The underground crack was huge. Even though Lu Ming had transformed into an ancient God, he was still very small and he could easily rush in.</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s expression changed slightly when she saw Lu Ming rushing into the underground crack.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t even think about escaping!”</p><p>In the end, the absolute beauty gritted her teeth and also rushed in.</p><p>The underground crack was huge. The deeper it went, the wider it became. However, the cold air also became stronger.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at the bottom. The cold air here was already very shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the divine power of the moon with all his might. With the protection of the ice chains, he was able to block the attack of the cold air.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sound of a sword rang out as a sword light rapidly approached from above.</p><p>“This woman really won’t let me off!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and he rushed forward.</p><p>The ground beneath the crack was like a large Canyon.</p><p>Lu Ming, yes, it’s right in front. I can feel an incomparably dense cold Qi. There must be some cold treasures here. It can even refine the energy of many stars ‘cores!</p><p>The quantity formula kept tempting Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming ran at a high speed and soon, he reached the end.</p><p>At the end, there was a huge black cave, from which cold nether energy was constantly flowing out.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed in without any hesitation. Not long after, the beautiful woman followed suit.</p><p>There was a passage in the cave. Lu Ming ran for thousands of miles and his eyes suddenly opened up.</p><p>This was a huge underground space. The surrounding walls were embedded with snow-white gemstones that constantly emitted a chill.</p><p>At a glance, there were no less than a few hundred of them, emitting a hazy glow.</p><p>could these be Supreme cold treasures? no, the quality of these gemstones is much worse!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>Although these gemstones exuded extreme coldness, their quality was not high. They were probably much worse than the cold jade stone.</p><p>However, if he sold it to those who cultivated cold attribute Shen power, it should be worth a lot of Shen crystals.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>This was not what he wanted.</p><p>that’s not right. I can feel that there’s an extremely high-quality treasure of extreme cold in this area. There’s no mistake. Let me sense it!</p><p>The quantity formula shouted.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light flashed, and the absolute beauty chased in.</p><p>“This crazy woman is really here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was somewhat gloomy.</p><p>However, the coldness here was very strong. The beautiful woman had to set up layers of divine power around her body to block the cold from the outside world.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>As soon as the absolute beauty saw Lu Ming, she was about to charge at him.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the underground space suddenly started to shake. The surrounding walls started to make rumbling sounds.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Suddenly, the wall on one side burst open, and stone and ice flew everywhere. Then, a huge head popped out.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He did not expect a head to stick out from the wall.</p><p>This head was not the head of an animal. It was more like a plant’s. It was like a tree stump, white and crystal clear, covered with roots.</p><p>Furthermore, it was extremely huge, at least a few thousand meters in length and width.</p><p>a cold-attribute treasure! Yes, there’s a cold-attribute treasure in the middle of its brows!</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula shouted.</p><p>Lu Ming took a closer look. Indeed, there was a silver-white gem embedded on the stump-like head. A terrifying chill was exuded from the silver-white gem.</p><p>what a shocking coldness. It’s no worse than the ice jade cold heart of the ice Soul Clan!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and his heart was burning.</p><p>If he could obtain this gem and pass it to the quantity formula, he could use it to neutralize the energy in the core of the star. It would definitely be able to quickly refine some energy for Lu Ming’s breakthrough.</p><p>He wanted to get it!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After the stump-like head appeared, it roared and opened its mouth. In the void, hundreds of icicles were instantly condensed and then whizzed toward Lu Ming and the beautiful woman.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming kept casting the air-piercing move. The Spear’s gleam burst out one after another to block the attack of the ice thorns.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>A series of collision sounds rang out. Lu Ming managed to block the icicles, but his body shook violently and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>“What shocking strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were a little solemn.</p><p>On the other side, the beautiful woman waved her sword and easily blocked the attack of the ice thorns.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Seeing that it could not finish off Lu Ming and the beautiful woman with one move, the tree-stump head seemed to be furious. It opened its mouth and spewed out white mist, which gushed toward Lu Ming and the beautiful woman.</p><p>This mist was like an upgraded version of the frostnether Qi, and it was filled with a terrifying chill.</p><p>Wherever the mist passed, ice crystals would appear in the air. It was extremely terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
