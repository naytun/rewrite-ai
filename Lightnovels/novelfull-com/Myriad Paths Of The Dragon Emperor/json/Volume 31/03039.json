The young man stopped and glanced at you han. Without saying anything, he retreated to the side silently, as if he was extremely afraid of you han.</p><p>“You two, come at me together!”</p><p>His cold gaze then turned to Chu BA Xing and Si Ji.</p><p>Many people were shocked. You han actually wanted to fight Chu BA Xing and Si Ji alone? where did he get his confidence from? did he really have such strong battle power?</p><p>They were all half-step divine kings and had both awakened the origin divine force factor. They were both astonishingly talented. Even if there was a gap between them, it was limited.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to fight one against two!</p><p>And now, you han was challenging both Chu BA Xing and Si Ji at the same time.</p><p>Chu BA Xing and Si Ji’s eyes revealed a cold light.</p><p>“Arrogant! Since you want to die, we’ll fulfill your wish. Si Ji, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Chu baxing shouted.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Si Ji acted even more simply. He held his saber with both hands and slashed out, sending a saber ray that was tens of thousands of meters long towards you han.</p><p>As the blade radiance slashed down, it seemed to split the heavens and earth apart. The air trembled and a terrifying force pressed down on you han.</p><p>Si Ji’s attack was simple, but it was terrifyingly powerful and overbearing.</p><p>With one slash, the enemy was killed!</p><p>“God of War’s strike!”</p><p>Chu baxing roared in anger and used the Ares attack once more.</p><p>However, the God of War’s strike this time had a huge change.</p><p>This time, the war god was much smaller. It was only 30 meters tall. However, it was riding a war Horse. The war horse trod through the void and charged towards you han. It was much more agile than before.</p><p>come, I’ll let you experience the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion’s ultimate technique. Hehe!</p><p>You han sneered. His body twisted in a strange way, and he charged forward like a shadow.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, and he was like a ghostly shadow flashing through the air. When si Ji’s blade light and Chu baxing’s God of War attack landed on his body, he twisted his body slightly to dissipate the power. Then, with extreme speed, he charged towards Chu baxing.</p><p>“I want your soul!”</p><p>You han said coldly as he clawed at Chu baxing.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing roared, and a dazzling golden light erupted like a volcano. A huge spear light swept out, and the sky rumbled.</p><p>However, you Han’s body continued to twist and twist. With each twist, he was able to dissipate a portion of the force, and then a strange force rushed towards Chu baxing.</p><p>Chu baxing’s body swayed, and the golden light on his body trembled as if he had been greatly affected.</p><p>You han took the opportunity to launch a series of attacks, forcing Chu baxing to retreat.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, si Ji arrived. He sent out thousands of saber rays, forming a net of saber Qi that enveloped you han.</p><p>You han was still a little apprehensive and gave up on continuing to attack Chu baxing. His figure flickered and dodged the attack of the saber net.</p><p>“We’ll still be attacked in the end!”</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming observed carefully and thought to himself.</p><p>He realized that although you Han’s cultivation technique was strange, it wasn’t really impossible to attack. He could only dissipate some of the power when he was attacked, but he would still be injured.</p><p>“However, the technique that affects the soul is a little troublesome!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered. What should he do if he were to encounter the geniuses of the abysmal Heavenly King residence?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>You han dodged si Ji’s attack, and a cold light flashed in his eyes. His body turned into a shadow of a sword, and a long sword that looked like a shadow attacked si Ji.</p><p>“Extinction, slash!”</p><p>Si Ji coldly shouted as he slashed out with his blade.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber Light and the shadow Sword that you han had transformed into clashed together, creating a violent boom. Vast energy swept out in all directions as if it was going to devour everything.</p><p>You Han’s shadow trembled violently and flew back. However, a strange power from the dark rushed towards si Ji.</p><p>Si Ji’s body trembled, and in an instant, he seemed to have been greatly disturbed, causing his aura to weaken.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>You han shouted and wanted to take the chance to attack si Ji, but Chu BA Xing arrived and stopped you han.</p><p>Seeing this scene, many people’s faces turned grave.</p><p>You Han’s direct attacks might not be strong, but his methods were strange and hard to defend against.</p><p>If si Ji and Chu baxing had not joined forces, he would not have been you Han’s match alone.</p><p>Chu BA Xing and Si Ji worked together to fight you han.</p><p>However, it was difficult to determine the winner for a while, and no one could do anything to the other.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a change occurred in the castle.</p><p>The ground around the castle began to shake, and the peach trees, which required several people to wrap their arms around them, began to undergo a shocking transformation.</p><p>The peach tree was originally full of blooming flowers, but at this moment, the flowers on the peach tree were rapidly falling and withering.</p><p>Soon, all the peach trees became bare. Then, the trunks began to dry up as if their vitality had been sucked out.</p><p>Such a strange scene caused Chu BA Xing and the other two to end their battle. They split into two sides and observed the changes in the peach forest.</p><p>“The peach tree moved. No, it came alive!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed.</p><p>When the trunks of the peach trees shriveled to a certain extent, they actually began to move. Their roots extended from the ground, and eyes and mouths even appeared on the trunks.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>Then, the peach trees howled like wild beasts. Their roots were like feet as they strode toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>The tree demon!</p><p>The peach tree turned into a tree demon and charged at the crowd.</p><p>However, the crowd was not shocked. Instead, they were happy.</p><p>They thought of something. The peach tree had turned into a tree demon. Did that mean that the formation had been destroyed without them attacking?</p><p>“We might be able to enter the castle after killing these tree demons.”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Many people charged towards the demonic tree.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The tree demon roared. Those roots were like soft whips, whipping towards everyone. The force whistled, and the power was very shocking.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Some of the weaker cultivators had their bodies pierced by the roots and died.</p><p>However, only a small number of them were killed, and even more of the tree demons were destroyed.</p><p>For experts like Chu BA Xing, si Ji, and you han, every time they attacked, a few demonic trees would be killed. Some would be cut into pieces, some would be blasted into pieces, and some would be burned to ashes.</p><p>Soon, a large number of tree demons were killed, and many people rushed to the castle.</p><p>This time, there really wasn’t any obstruction. The group easily passed through the area around the castle and rushed in different directions.</p><p>However, not everyone rushed towards the castle. Some of the weaker cultivators still maintained their rationality and did not rush in.</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, Wu zixiong, and Lu Ming did not go in either.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
