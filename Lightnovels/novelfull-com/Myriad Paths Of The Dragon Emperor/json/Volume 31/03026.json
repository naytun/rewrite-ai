The armor was unable to block it. It trembled and was pierced through by the sword light.</p><p>The sword gleam slashed at Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Fortunately, after going through the ice chains and the continuous obstruction of the nine layers of Crimson Gold armor, the power of the sword gleam had been reduced by 90%. When it slashed at Lu Ming, only 10% of its power was left.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>A sword wound that was more than ten meters long appeared on Lu Ming’s body. He retreated quickly.</p><p>However, this sword wound was only a superficial wound. Lu Ming’s injury was not serious. With his strong vitality, he recovered quickly.</p><p>Not far away, gold ingot reappeared.</p><p>His aura was a little weak. It was obvious that the move just now had consumed a lot of his energy.</p><p>hahaha, I’ve finally broken through your defense. Now, let’s see what you’re going to use to block my attack!</p><p>Gold ingot laughed.</p><p>“So what if it’s broken? Idiot, this is a secret technique, not a treasure. If it’s broken, I can’t re-condense it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s calm voice was heard. Then, with a thought, nine ice chains flew out again and wrapped around his body.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Jin Yuan almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. The aura on his body surged out.</p><p>He had only asked gold ingot to keep attacking because he wanted to see gold ingot’s strongest killing move and test the defensive power of the ice chains.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t have the means to fight back.</p><p>“Three apocalyptic strikes, star explosion!”</p><p>A deep voice came out of Lu Ming’s mouth. Then, a huge spear radiance shot toward Jin Yuan.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s expression changed. He felt a fatal danger.</p><p>His body glowed with golden light. A golden sword appeared and covered his entire body.</p><p>“Void severing hand!”</p><p>die! Jin Yuan shouted as he activated the void-breaking hand and slashed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Golden Palm struck the huge spear radiance.</p><p>However, the moment they collided, the spear radiance shattered like a star exploding. The terrifying destructive power swept toward Jin Yuan.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s body shook violently. He was sent flying by the powerful force. He only managed to stabilize himself after flying for tens of thousands of meters.</p><p>At this moment, cracks appeared on his golden sword. Blood kept oozing out of it, and his palm was trembling.</p><p>Gold ingot was injured by the star explosion.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, you should die …”</p><p>Jin Yuan glared at Lu Ming and bellowed. His expression was extremely ferocious, like a wild beast that had gone mad.</p><p>Many people were shocked. They did not expect that Lu Ming could not only fight with Jin Yuan but also injure him.</p><p>“A move for. move …”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>you can only use this ultimate move once at most. I don’t believe that you can use it forever …</p><p>Gold ingot said.</p><p>Just like his previous move, although its power was extremely terrifying, it also consumed an astonishing amount of his body’s divine power. After using this move, he had consumed a great deal of divine power.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then open your eyes wide and watch, supernova!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and his aura burst out. Another huge spear radiance rushed toward Jin Yuan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance exploded, and the destructive power sent Jin Yuan flying.</p><p>This time, Jin Yuan’s injuries were even more severe. More cracks appeared on his golden armor.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Just as Jin Yuan was about to roar, Lu Ming struck again. Another Spear’s gleam charged at Jin Yuan.</p><p>It was true that the star explosion consumed a shocking amount of divine power. One move would drain all of Lu Ming’s divine power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the ‘measure’ formula. Why would he be afraid of his divine power being drained?</p><p>As long as Lu Ming was free, he would transfer and store divine energy into the quantity formula.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming’s strongest move could be used continuously.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>run! Jin Yuan roared. He couldn’t accept it. Then, he turned around and ran.</p><p>He was really afraid. Lu Ming could actually use such a powerful unique skill continuously. Under the bombardment of such unique skills, if he did not run, he would be exhausted to death sooner or later.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The metal essence transformed into a golden light and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming did not give chase.</p><p>Jin Yuan was indeed very powerful. Lu Ming only had a slight advantage by relying on the star explosion and the ice chain. However, if Jin Yuan was determined to escape, Lu Ming could not stop him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across Jin Xing, Qin Wukong, and the rest.</p><p>The expressions of Jin Xing, Qin Wukong, and the others changed drastically. They turned as white as snow without a trace of blood.</p><p>They had never expected that even Jin Yuan, one of the four heroes of the Jin family who had awakened the origin divine power factor, was not Lu Ming’s match. At that moment, they were almost scared to death when they saw Lu Ming’s gaze.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Jin Xing roared, turned around and ran.</p><p>Qin Wukong and the others were the same. They did not dare to stop at all.</p><p>“You want to leave? did I allow you to?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and caught up with Jin Xing, Qin Wukong, and the rest in a few flashes.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear at one of the Qin clan’s paragons.</p><p>The Qin clan’s prodigy had a cultivation base of a ninth-level heavenly deity. At this moment, he was extremely frightened. He retaliated with a full-force attack. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he did not have the slightest ability to resist.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite’s glabella as if it could pierce through nothing, killing him.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had already killed the geniuses of the Jin and Qin families. The Jin and Qin families would never let him off. It did not matter if he killed one or a few of them. Naturally, Lu Ming would not let them off.</p><p>After killing the Qin clan’s elite warrior, Lu Ming thrust his spear at Qin Wukong.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Qin Wukong roared and circulated his divine energy. He injured his own body to increase the power of the seven injury divine fist. Then, he threw a punch with all his might.</p><p>A dazzling fist force was sent flying towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. The Spear’s gleam was like a shooting star as it pierced through.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear stabbed into Qin Wukong’s fist imprint. The fist imprint trembled slightly and then exploded. It could not stop Lu Ming’s attack at all.</p><p>Before Lu Ming’s origin divine power factor had awakened, Qin Wukong was indeed able to fight with Lu Ming and could exchange many moves.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s ruler’s divine power had already awakened the origin divine force factor. Moreover, the degree of awakening of the inextinguishable sword force had already reached ninety-nine percent. His combat strength was several times stronger than before. Naturally, he could easily crush Qin Wukong.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>The fist imprint was easily destroyed by Lu Ming. Qin Wukong roared in fear and wanted to escape, but it was too late.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced out and nailed Qin Wukong in the air.</p><p>“No, no,…”</p><p>Seeing this scene, Jin Xing roared madly and was almost scared to death. He used all his strength to run forward.</p><p>However, his speed could not be compared to Lu Ming’s. Lu Ming caught up with Jin Xing in a few flashes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me. I’m one of the four heroes of the Jin family. If you kill me, the Jin family will never let you off!”</p><p>Jin Xing roared.</p><p>Now, he could only use his identity to threaten Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
