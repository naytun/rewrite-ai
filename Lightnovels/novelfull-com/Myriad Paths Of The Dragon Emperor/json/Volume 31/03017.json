His aura was surging and shocking.</p><p>“Lu Ming, take my strongest move!”</p><p>The young man roared. A battle-axe appeared in his hand. The battle-axe rapidly grew in size and became 10000 meters wide.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The young man roared. He became one with his axe and attacked with all his might, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming activated the fourfold combat power of the battle character formula. Nine ice chains flew out and enveloped Lu Ming, wrapping him tightly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The battleaxe hit the ice chain’s defense and exploded with a loud bang. The force spread in all directions, and the shock waves spread in all directions.</p><p>The ice chain shook a few times and then was fine. Lu Ming did not move at all.</p><p>On the other hand, the young man’s body was pushed back by the force of the rebound. He landed on the stone platform and was pushed back dozens of steps.</p><p>impressive. I’m not your match. Goodbye!</p><p>The young man cupped his fists and left the stone platform.</p><p>He had already used his strongest move and knew that he was no match for Lu Ming. He might as well admit defeat and leave.</p><p>Lu Ming was not bothered by it. After a faint smile, he shifted his gaze to the stone platform further up.</p><p>He had already experienced the stone platforms here. Although the cultivation speed was not bad, there were better ones. Why not choose the better one?</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the first and second rows. They were his target.</p><p>In the first row, there was a top genius who had awakened the origin divine power factor. Lu Ming was not his match yet, so he naturally would not challenge him.</p><p>As for the other two people, Lu Ming estimated that they were very close to awakening the original divine power factor. Their degree of awakening was estimated to be more than ninety percent. Lu Ming was not confident in dealing with them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the second row.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to challenge the second row first. He would challenge the geniuses in the first row after he had awakened more divine power.</p><p>Lu Ming waited quietly.</p><p>In the second row, Lu Ming saw people from the Qin and Jin families.</p><p>The two clans each had a heaven’s favorite in the second row.</p><p>“You two!”</p><p>Lu Ming planned to challenge the Qin and Jin family’s paragons when their time was up.</p><p>They would challenge whoever arrived first.</p><p>Not long after, someone in the third row had reached their time limit. Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not make a move.</p><p>eh, Lu Ming isn’t making a move. Is he waiting for the second or first row? ”</p><p>Someone guessed in surprise.</p><p>“Wait for the second and first row? No way. Lu Ming was that powerful? The first three rows are all half-step Divine King heaven’s favorites with high levels of divine power awakening!”</p><p>look at the heaven’s favorite in the third row. He’s not challenging him and he’s just standing there without cultivating. He must want to challenge the person above!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>However, no one went up to challenge the genius in the third row. That genius was very strong and there were no half-step divine kings.</p><p>Normally, half-step divine kings could get a spot without any pressure.</p><p>Only those below the half-step Divine King realm would compete for it.</p><p>After waiting for a day, no one accepted the challenge. The young man continued to cultivate.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he stood on the stone platform and continued to wait. His body was covered in a layer of light.</p><p>He had a lot of freedom to cultivate here. Even if the day was up, he could choose not to cultivate.</p><p>Take Lu Ming for example. A day had passed. As long as he did not enter the cultivation state, he would not enter the universe to cultivate.</p><p>It would only be a waste of time to waste time.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for another two days.</p><p>On this day, there was finally some movement on the second row of stone platforms.</p><p>A young man in a golden robe was emitting light.</p><p>“Have we finally arrived?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered as a cold glint flashed in his eyes. This golden-robed young man was truly a genius of the Jin family.</p><p>The young man from the Jin family opened his eyes, but he still sat there quietly without any intention of getting up.</p><p>He didn’t think anyone would dare to challenge him.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his eyes narrowed. Someone had appeared on his stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed to his stone platform at the first moment.</p><p>“It’s you, Lu Ming. You want to challenge me?”</p><p>The Paragon of the Jin family was stunned when he saw Lu Ming. He was clearly surprised.</p><p>“Can’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Of course you can. If you want to die, I’ll naturally fulfill your wish!”</p><p>The young man from Jin family laughed.</p><p>“Jin Jue, you have to underestimate him. He killed Qin Mu with a few moves earlier!”</p><p>At this moment, Jin Xing’s voice came.</p><p>Jin Xing, who had been watching from afar, reminded him.</p><p>“He killed Qin Mu?”</p><p>what? ” Jin Jue was slightly taken aback. it seems like your strength has exceeded my expectations!</p><p>Even though he said that, Jin Jue was still very confident.</p><p>Qin Mu was only a ninth level heavenly God.</p><p>On the other hand, Jin Jue was a half-step Divine King. Furthermore, the degree of his divine Power’s awakening had already reached about sixty percent. His abilities were far from what Qin Mu could compare to.</p><p>While the two of them were conversing, the others had already started to fight for the stone platform that Lu Ming had used earlier.</p><p>Lu Ming and Jin Jue did not make a move. They were waiting for the others to decide the outcome before making a move.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming’s stone platform was occupied by a young man.</p><p>“Now, it’s your turn!”</p><p>Jin Jue looked at Lu Ming and sneered. Golden light emanated from his body.</p><p>The Golden radiance was extremely dense, like a golden armor that enveloped him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jin Jue took a step forward and his palm turned pure gold. A golden combat sword appeared in his hand and he slashed it at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>ancient God! Lu Ming roared. His body swelled up and turned into an ancient God.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to use his ancient God Body against a half-step Divine King. Otherwise, he would not be a match for his opponent in his normal form.</p><p>However, Lu Ming held back. After he used the ancient God Body, his battle character formula only doubled his combat power.</p><p>As long as it was enough.</p><p>“Break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming thrust his spear forward. The Spear’s gleam collided with the opponent’s golden sword radiance, creating a terrifying shock wave.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>After Lu Ming launched his first attack, he took a step forward and continued to attack.</p><p>He brandished his spear and launched a storm-like attack.</p><p>“Void-breaking sword!”</p><p>Jin Jue let out a long roar, and golden divine light surged as he slashed out golden sword marks.</p><p>This sword mark was truly terrifying. It was incomparably sharp and seemed to be able to cut through everything.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two sides had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“The Jin family’s space-breaking secret technique is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Even Lu Ming could not help but sigh at the power of the Jin family’s Secret technique.</p><p>The Jin family was ranked high among all the families in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. It was not just talk, but they had fought their way to the top with their strength.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>In the middle of the battle, Lu Ming had a thought and nine ice chains flew out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
