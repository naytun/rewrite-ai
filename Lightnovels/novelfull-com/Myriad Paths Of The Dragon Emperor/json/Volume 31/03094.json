Hand it over!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“How do you know that the nine absolute divine crystal is in the hands of the dark ice Clan?”</p><p>An Yin asked unwillingly.</p><p>“Oh? It seems that the person behind you didn’t inform you that you’ve been exposed?”</p><p>it seems like you have been abandoned by the person behind the scenes!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>.com</p><p>Apparently, they didn’t know that they had been exposed. The one behind them didn’t inform them. Apparently, he had abandoned the dark ice Clan to protect himself.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>An Yin roared in anger. He had also figured this out and was furious.</p><p>you’ve all been abandoned, so there’s no need to hide. Tell me, who’s the person behind you, and which family is he from? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>An Yin shook his head.</p><p>“You don’t know? Hehe, you’re still helping to hide it even at this point. They’ve already abandoned you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he said.</p><p>I just don’t know. Every time we meet them, they’re all wrapped in black robes and we meet on Magic City mountain. I only know that they’re a big force from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, but I don’t know who they are exactly!</p><p>also, the nine absolute divine crystal is indeed with me. It’s in my storage ring. Take it. I hope you’ll let go of those people of the Dark ice Clan with low cultivation. They’re no threat to you!</p><p>After an Yin finished speaking, he let out a long sigh.</p><p>He knew that he would not be able to survive today. The winner was King and the loser was vilified. He understood this very well.</p><p>He only hoped that some of the dark ice race’s people with low cultivation bases could survive and not be exterminated.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It seemed that the dark ice Race really did not know who the mastermind was.</p><p>This could be deduced from the fact that the person behind the scenes didn’t inform the dark ice Race.</p><p>If the dark ice Race knew who the mastermind was, the mastermind would not dare to let Lu Ming and the rest kill the dark ice Race. Was he not afraid that the dark ice Race would give them up?</p><p>From this, it could be seen that the person behind the scenes was very assured because he knew that the dark ice Clan didn’t know who they were.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>This clue was broken again. Was it so difficult to find the person behind the scenes?</p><p>After that, Lu Ming removed an Yin’s storage ring and started searching the contents.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming took out a small dark gold box. After opening it, there was a crystal inside that emitted a shocking amount of energy. This was the nine ultimate divine crystal, the precious treasure of the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Looking at the nine ultimate divine crystal, Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery light.</p><p>This nine absolute God crystal was definitely a rare treasure. Its value was probably not lower than the star core he had obtained back then. However, this was an important treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He did not dare to covet it.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan and the others naturally did not dare to have any thoughts about the nine absolute divine crystal. It was a hot potato. If they did not handle it well, their entire clan would be annihilated. No matter how valuable it was, they could only look at it.</p><p>“Chief ice, I’ll leave this storage ring and the dark ice Race to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he handed an Yin’s storage ring to the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>alright, when this is over, we’ll split the spoils equally!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan smiled and put away the storage ring. Then, he looked at an Yin coldly and killed an Yin with one last attack.</p><p>He would definitely not let an Yin off.</p><p>There was no suspense in the battle after that. The dark ice Clan was almost annihilated. However, the ice Soul Clan did not kill them all. They did not kill some of the dark ice Clan members with low cultivation.</p><p>After packing up, the Kong Xuan sect and the ice Soul Clan met up and flew out.</p><p>“Clan leader Bing, be careful later!”</p><p>Lu Ming reminded him.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul clan’s eyes flickered. He was a smart man and naturally understood what Lu Ming meant.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame tribe, the three Overlord forces, and some top sects didn’t come. They probably didn’t have good intentions.</p><p>He secretly ordered the ice Soul Clan to form a large formation.</p><p>Soon, they were out of the glacier.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the rest flew out of the glacier, they could sense powerful auras coming from all directions.</p><p>Countless figures appeared from all directions, surrounding Lu Ming and the rest in the middle. Their powerful auras were firmly locked on them.</p><p>These people were naturally the Scarlet Flame tribe and the three Overlord forces.</p><p>“What are you guys doing?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan shouted coldly.</p><p>“It’s simple. Hand over the nine absolute divine crystal. Also, Lu Ming, kill yourself!”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect took a step forward and his cold voice spread in all directions.</p><p>The expressions of the Kong Xuan sect and the ice Soul Clan changed drastically.</p><p>In particular, everyone in the Kong Xuan sect had an even uglier expression. These people were actually targeting Lu Ming at this time.</p><p>you guys have a big appetite. Not only do you want the nine absolute God crystal, but you also want my life. Aren’t you afraid that you will die from overeating? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His expression was calm and he was not worried at all.</p><p>These people’s actions were within his expectations.</p><p>hahaha, we’re all gathered here today. Do you think you can do anything? Lu Ming, you’re going to die today. I advise you to hand over the nine ultimate divine crystal and we’ll give you a quick death!</p><p>The headmaster of the winged demon Academy sneered.</p><p>If they took the nine absolute God crystal to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and handed it over, they would definitely be rewarded. They would naturally not miss this opportunity.</p><p>This operation could be said to kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t believe them. Even if you agree to their terms, they won’t let us off!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan roared.</p><p>The other party had mobilized so many people, so how could they let them go so easily?</p><p>hahaha, you’re right. The ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect will be destroyed today!</p><p>A burly man from the red flame tribe laughed. He was the tribe leader of the red flame tribe.</p><p>“Let’s rush out together!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch roared and his aura exploded. He wanted to rush out from one of the directions.</p><p>“Old ice, I’m your opponent!”</p><p>From the red flame clan’s direction, an old man burst out. His body was covered in flames like a sun as he charged toward the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, and it was earth-shattering. The sky trembled, and half of the sky turned into ice and snow, while the other half turned into flames.</p><p>“Red flame old ghost!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch roared.</p><p>The one who attacked was the patriarch of the red flame race, who was also at the fourth level of the divine King realm.</p><p>The patriarchs of the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan were both at the fourth level of the king God Realm. That was why the two clans had been fighting for so many years without a winner.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The forefather of the Scarlet Flame clan shouted and charged toward the old man of the ice Soul Clan. The two masters were engaged in a fierce battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
