Under the activation of the origin divine power factor, its power was extremely powerful. It was not something people like Jin Jue and Jin Xing could compare to.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Lu Ming activated his ancient God Body and turned into a green-armored ancient God. Then, he thrust his spear at Jin Yuan.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>It was as if two planets had crashed into each other. The void trembled like boiling water, and violent energy surged in all directions like the water of a vast ocean, making loud rumbling sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming could feel a terrifying force coming from the long spear. He could not help but retreat.</p><p>However, Jin Xing wasn’t any better off. His body also floated back.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jin Yuan retreated and stepped into the air, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and charged forward with his spear.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely. In terms of size, Lu Ming was much larger than Jin Yuan. However, Jin Yuan’s strength was not any weaker than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of moves in a row, but there was no clear winner.</p><p>“Damn, how can this kid’s Shen power be so strong?”</p><p>Jin Yuan shouted in shock.</p><p>Both of them had awakened the origin divine force factor but he was a half-step Divine King while Lu Ming was only a fifth-level heavenly God.</p><p>Indeed, although Lu Ming controlled many types of divine powers, only one of them had awakened the origin divine power factor. Moreover, his cultivation was at the fifth-level heavenly God Realm. He would not be able to fight against Jin Yuan by relying on only one type of ruler’s divine power.</p><p>However, he had other divine powers, especially the undying sword force, which had been awakened to ninety-nine percent. This made up for the gap between them. With the activation of the battle character formula, which increased his battle power by four times, he was able to compete with Jin Yuan.</p><p>“Void-breaking sword, slash!”</p><p>Jin Yuan bellowed in rage. His glabella glowed and a golden combat sword flew out, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen Jin Xing use this move before. He was not surprised as he was prepared for it.</p><p>Dragon roars were heard as nine-clawed divine Dragons that were ten thousand meters long formed above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>A total of seven pounced toward Jin Yuan.</p><p>However, two more nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed after the seven, making a total of nine divine Dragons.</p><p>After a period of cultivation, especially in the myriad God cliff where he fought against the figures condensed from the divine power, Lu Ming’s Divine Dragon materialization technique had made another breakthrough. He could condense nine Divine Dragon manifestations at once.</p><p>Moreover, the divine Dragon materialization art was even more terrifying with the support of the ruler’s divine power, which had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>The nine divine Dragons pounced at Jin Yuan continuously. Jin Yuan controlled the void-breaking sword and slashed at the divine Dragon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Terrifying clashing sounds rang out continuously as the nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons clashed with the void-breaking sword.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming cast the ice chain and attacked Jin Yuan.</p><p>Jin Yuan hurriedly used the void-breaking hand to block it, but Lu Ming wielded his long spear and charged at Jin Yuan.</p><p>Lu Ming used all his means and forced Jin Yuan to retreat continuously. He was at a disadvantage.</p><p>The others were shocked. Was gold ingot going to lose today?</p><p>This was a big deal.</p><p>you want to defeat me? impossible! Void-breaking sword, kill with nine sword moves!</p><p>die! Jin Yuan bellowed. His entire body suddenly emitted a blinding light, and the space between his brows was like a small sun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Sword hums sounded, and golden combat swords rushed out of Jin Yuan’s forehead.</p><p>There were a total of eight, and with the one from before, there were nine in total.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Golden Void-severing sword continued to slash out, and the sword light whistled through the air with astonishing power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He swung his long spear continuously to block the golden sword.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The Golden combat sword continuously slashed at the long spear. The long spear trembled violently, and the terrifying power of the void split through the long spear and spread to Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>Cracks appeared on the green scales on Lu Ming’s body, and blood seeped out.</p><p>Moreover, the long spear in Lu Ming’s hand was cracked.</p><p>“What a shocking power!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>This spear was a high-grade level nine divine artifact, but it could not block the other party’s power.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Jin Yuan shouted and controlled the void-splitting sword to continue slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>He wanted to kill Lu Ming in one go.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the ice chain and flew it back, enveloping himself in it.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The space-severing sword struck the ice chains, producing clanking sounds and sparks. However, the ice chains were completely fine, only leaving a few marks on them.</p><p>“It’s so hard!”</p><p>Jin Yuan’s eyes narrowed in shock.</p><p>The void-severing sword was said to be able to sever the void. Its destructive power was shocking. In addition, there were eight of them attacking at the same time. The power was even more terrifying. However, they could not cut through Lu Ming’s ice chains.</p><p>I don’t believe it. Cut, cut, cut!</p><p>die! Jin Yuan shouted and controlled the void-breaking sword to slash at Lu Ming wildly. However, it was blocked by the ice chains in the end.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was pushed back by the powerful impact, the gold ingot could not hurt him at all.</p><p>In the end, gold ingot even used the void severing hand, but it was useless.</p><p>Lu Ming hid in the ice chains and took the time to counterattack. He shot out rays of spear radiance at Jin Yuan.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s the point of hiding in there? come and fight me if you dare!”</p><p>Gold ingot roared.</p><p>“This is my secret skill, a defensive secret skill. Does it not count as strength? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>Jin Yuan gritted his teeth, speechless.</p><p>Indeed, this was Lu Ming’s Secret skill and he did not rely on any treasure. Be it an offensive, defensive or Speed Secret skill, they were all part of his strength.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t think that I can’t break your defense!”</p><p>Jin Yuan’s face was filled with ruthlessness. At this moment, the nine void-severing swords all flew back into his body and fused with it.</p><p>The Golden radiance on Jin Yuan’s body grew even more intense. In the end, he turned into a golden combat sword and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The golden sword radiance illuminated the sky as if it was going to split the sky in half. The sword Qi whistled through the air in a terrifying manner.</p><p>“What a powerful force, block it for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. This should be Jin Yuan’s most powerful attack.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine ice chains with all his might. His divine power was constantly flowing into the ice chains.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the sword made of gold ingot hit the ice chain, and the ice chain shook violently.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The next moment, something happened that made Lu Ming’s eyes narrow. The ice chains broke one by one. After a few breaths, all nine ice chains were broken.</p><p>Then, the golden sword gleam slashed at Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the protection of the nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor.</p><p>However, even the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor could not block the golden sword radiance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
