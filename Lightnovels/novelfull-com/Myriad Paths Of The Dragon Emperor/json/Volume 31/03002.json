An ordinary 1-stage Divine King like the night Demon King was most likely not that powerful.</p><p>This was a heaven’s favorite who could fight across a large realm.</p><p>wife, help your husband block this beast first. Your husband will go and find someone to help!</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming would not miss such a good opportunity. After leaving behind those words, he disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“Despicable, shameless …”</p><p>you’re courting death! the beautiful woman shouted angrily. She was so angry that she almost vomited blood. Her beautiful face was flushed red. She secretly swore that the next time she saw Lu Ming, she would definitely cut him into pieces to vent her hatred.</p><p>At the thought that Lu Ming actually called her his wife, she gnashed her teeth in hatred.</p><p>“Could it be that this guy knows? Impossible! Even if I knew, I would still kill him!”</p><p>The absolute beauty gritted her teeth and focused on dealing with the giant ape in front of her.</p><p>Lu Ming was running at full speed. It did not take long for him to transform into his human form. He had been using the ancient God Body all this while, and it was very draining on him.</p><p>After transforming into his human form, Lu Ming flew for a while and found a hidden ice cave. He flew in.</p><p>After taking a closer look, he realized that there were no other living beings in the ice cave. Lu Ming moved a piece of ice and blocked the ice cave. Then, he sat cross-legged and circulated the universe thousand Dao Scripture to recover.</p><p>After a few days, Lu Ming’s divine power and physical strength had recovered to their peak.</p><p>“It’s a pity that QiuQiu can’t come in here. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be in such a sorry state!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>No one below the Godking level could enter Starmoon ancient city. QiuQiu was a metallic lifeform, so it naturally couldn’t enter either.</p><p>Otherwise, with QiuQiu’s strength, it could easily suppress existences like the absolute beauty and the giant ape.</p><p>I must quickly find the treasure of zhihan and improve my strength!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly gritted his teeth.</p><p>During this period of time, he was repeatedly hunted down, and he really had a stomach full of pent-up anger.</p><p>He got up and left the ice cave. Lu Ming continued to venture deeper into the nethercold land.</p><p>Lu Ming, the cold Qi is extremely dense in the 8000-mile area ahead. There might be a treasure of extreme cold!</p><p>The voice of the ” quantity ” formula sounded.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula was extremely sensitive to energy fluctuations. Lu Ming asked the ” quantity ” formula to help him search for treasures with cold energy.</p><p>“Eight thousand miles ahead!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he flew forward.</p><p>Not long after, an Ice Lake appeared in front of them.</p><p>This Ice Lake wasn’t big, but the cold air was shockingly dense. It was many times denser than other places.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the source of the cold Qi is under the lake. However, I’m afraid that there’s a creature guarding the lake!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>there’s a living creature guarding it. What’s its cultivation level? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I don’t know about this. You can go down and find it yourself!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. In the end, he still decided to take a look.</p><p>Since he had already come this far, it would be a pity if he didn’t explore.</p><p>With a plop, Lu Ming rushed into the ice Lake.</p><p>Not long after …</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The frozen lake churned violently, stirring up thousands of waves. A white python could be seen rolling in the middle.</p><p>At the same time, rays of spear light burst out from the ice Lake. They were extremely bright.</p><p>A few moments passed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure dashed out of the frozen lake. It was Lu Ming.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed out, he cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and transformed into a nine heavenly kun Peng, leaving the place at great speed.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>A thousand-meter-long Python rushed out of the ice Lake. It looked up to the sky and roared, but it didn’t pursue in the end. It swam around the ice Lake for a while before returning to the lake.</p><p>Ten thousand miles away from the frozen lake, Lu Ming sat on an ice seal. He opened his palm and there was a crystal-like stone the size of a Dragon’s Eye on it. It exuded a shocking cold air.</p><p>This was the treasure that Lu Ming had brought out from the ice Lake.</p><p>“Old Liang, how is this ice jade crystal? How much energy can it help you refine from the star core?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in anticipation.</p><p>“Not much!”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula only had two words.</p><p>“Not much?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little disappointed.</p><p>although this ice jade crystal is a treasure of the extreme cold attribute, it’s still not as good as the ice jade heart or the ball of cold liquid you obtained before. It’s only stronger than the Cold Moon Stone, and it’s too small!</p><p>The quantity formula explained.</p><p>it seems that I have to continue looking for it. Forget it, you can absorb this ice jade crystal first. I will continue to look for other cold-attribute treasures!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He then let the ‘quantity’ formula absorb the ice jade crystal.</p><p>For the next half a month, Lu Ming went around the coldnether forbidden grounds in search of Supreme cold treasures.</p><p>He found a total of three, but unfortunately, they weren’t of particularly high level. They were all treasures of the same level as the ice jade crystal, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was walking in an Ice Valley.</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula told him that the energy fluctuation of the cold air in this Ice Valley was also very abnormal and very dense.</p><p>After moving forward for a while, there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Lu Ming was rather surprised that there were no living creatures guarding this place.</p><p>“This is a nine-petaled ice Lotus!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>At the end of the ice Valley, a lotus flower grew on a wall. It was crystal clear like jade and emitted a strong chill.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had seen a plant in the cold nether forbidden grounds. Moreover, it was a cold-attribute divine medicine.</p><p>The nine-petaled ice Lotus had a total of nine petals, which was very different from other lotus flowers.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had once read in an ancient book that the nine-petaled ice Lotus was the best among the cold-attribute divine herbs.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. This nine-petaled ice Lotus was definitely a treasure of the cold attribute that was better than the ice jade crystal. After absorbing it with the ” quantity ” formula, it would definitely help him refine a lot of energy from the star core.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed as he stepped forward. He used his divine power to form a large hand and picked the nine-petaled ice Lotus.</p><p>&Nbsp; but at this moment, several figures appeared above the ice Valley.</p><p>There were a total of five young people, both men and women, all wearing white robes.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, their eyes fell on the nine-petaled ice Lotus in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“Kid, hand over the nine-petaled ice Lotus!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted coldly, and an icy cold aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“I found it first, so why should I hand it over to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>you discovered it first. What a joke. We discovered this nine-petaled ice Lotus a long time ago. Previously, there were dire beasts guarding this place, and we lured them away. That’s how you managed to get your way. Do you understand? ”</p><p>A young man with snow-white hair said coldly.</p><p>“Attract the desolate beasts?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. However, the next moment, he knew that the other party was lying.</p><p>The other party’s reason did not seem to have any problems, but upon careful thought, it was full of loopholes.</p><p>There were five people on the other side. Was there a need for five people to act together to attract the dire beasts?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
