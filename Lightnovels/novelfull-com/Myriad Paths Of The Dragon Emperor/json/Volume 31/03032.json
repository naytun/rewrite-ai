The ground continued to crack and crack, especially the ground under young master sky Mantis.</p><p>Finally, there was a loud noise. The rock under young master sky mang exploded and collapsed. Dark holes hundreds of kilometers in length and width appeared.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s body began to fall.</p><p>there’s an underground space down there? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered. However, after a brief moment of thought, he did not hesitate and swooped down.</p><p>It was a huge underground space with many statues.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the statues and realized that they looked very much like the statues of various primitive deities. They were all very tall and the shortest one was more than a thousand meters tall.</p><p>The underground was like an underground Palace.</p><p>The ground was paved with a kind of Black Rock. Young master sky mang hit the ground and made a dull sound. He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood and his breath was a little weak. However, the ground was fine. There was not even a crack, let alone an explosion.</p><p>The ground was unimaginably hard.</p><p>Lu Ming did not continue to attack. Instead, he surveyed his surroundings.</p><p>In the surroundings, there was nothing but a large statue. It was quiet and there was nothing unusual.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis took the opportunity to get up and put on a defensive stance. He looked at Lu Ming with a guarded look.</p><p>At that moment, his eyes were filled with fear. Lu Ming’s abilities had exceeded his imagination.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that there would be such a place underground. It’ll be a good place for you to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke calmly, but his voice was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>kid, I admit that you are very strong, but you want to kill me? dream on. The battle has been going on for so long. He must be very tired. Your divine power must be almost exhausted, right? ”</p><p>Young master tianmang said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities were only slightly stronger than his. He could only dream of killing him.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. He took a step forward and his body suddenly rushed out. Then, he thrust his spear.</p><p>This spear was a supernova!</p><p>Lu Ming immediately used his strongest move. A ray of spear light was thrust at young master sky Mantis.</p><p>“It’s this move again …”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s pupils contracted sharply. He retreated quickly, trying to avoid this move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>However, the moment young master sky Mantis retreated, the spear light exploded. It turned into a destructive energy and rushed toward young master sky Mantis.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis let out a miserable cry as his body was sent flying. He smashed into a statue.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a violent explosion. The statue didn’t move at all. It wasn’t damaged at all. However, young master sky Mantis spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood. His shell caved in and almost cracked.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis roared angrily. Before Lu Ming could make a move, he stomped his back foot and retreated to a huge statue. Then, he stomped his back foot again and rushed from one statue to another.</p><p>Just like that, young master sky Mantis jumped from one statue to another at lightning speed.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming could not accurately capture young master sky Mantis’s position. It was difficult for him to unleash the power of his attack.</p><p>hahaha, kid, let’s see how you kill me. When I get out this time, I’ll make sure you die without a burial place, you piece of trash from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis laughed with a ferocious voice.</p><p>He, young master sky Mantis, had a high status in the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. He had never been humiliated like this. He must take revenge.</p><p>you’re really naive to think that you can escape under such circumstances. Do you think that you can avoid my attack and escape from my net with such means? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. Then, nine ice chains flew out.</p><p>The nine ice chains rapidly grew longer and shuttled between the statues, intertwining with each other.</p><p>The ice chain was a secret skill. As long as it was supported by Lu Ming’s divine power, it could keep growing longer.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The nine ice chains shuttled back and forth between the statues. Even the sky was covered by them.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s expression changed. His range of movement had been greatly reduced.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged forward with his long spear.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis quickly retreated and slashed at the ice chain several times. The ice chain trembled, but it was not cut off. The ice chain squirmed a little and tried to wrap around young master sky Mantis.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s expression changed, and he quickly retreated.</p><p>However, he was greeted by spear radiance.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis had no choice but to Dodge.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and cast another star burst.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, young master sky Mantis was hit directly. He screamed and was sent flying, hitting a statue.</p><p>This time, his injuries were even more severe. There were even a few cracks on his shell.</p><p>Blood kept flowing out.</p><p>His defense had been broken.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>no, I can’t die Here. He can’t use this ultimate move too many times!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis roared in his heart.</p><p>However, the next moment, he felt even more despair.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had thrust his spear again. This time, it was the same star explosion move.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis screamed again as his body was blown away by the destructive power. His blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>This time, he was even more miserable. The carapace on his chest had completely shattered, and a large piece of flesh was missing. His internal organs could even be seen.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was lying on the ground, vomiting blood. He had no power to resist.</p><p>“I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>no, you can’t kill me. I’m a member of the sky Mantis clan of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion. If you kill me, are you trying to cause a war between the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion? ”</p><p>Sky Mantis roared.</p><p>“The two Heavenly King manors are at war? What does it have to do with me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>He strode forward.</p><p>no! If you kill me, the sky Mantis will never let you go!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis roared.</p><p>“Hehe, even if I kill you, who would know?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to sneer. Young master sky Mantis’s face turned pale. He screamed, ” “No, don’t …”</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with young master sky Mantis. He cast another star Blast.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>This time, the spear light pierced into young master sky Mantis ‘body and exploded.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s screams came to an abrupt end because his body had exploded. His flesh and blood were scattered everywhere, and his soul had been turned into ashes.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis, a peerless genius who had awakened the source of divine power, had fallen!</p><p>Hu!</p><p>After killing young master sky Mantis, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was really hard to kill. He was fast and had amazing defense.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
