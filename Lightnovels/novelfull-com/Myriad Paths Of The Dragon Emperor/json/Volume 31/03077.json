Lu Ming had checked it a few times before but did not find anything.</p><p>“Watch!”</p><p>let’s go, ” LAN Shang said. Then, the axe floated in the air. LAN Shang’s fingers continuously drew runes, which flew into the axe.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The axe trembled slightly, and runes appeared on it.</p><p>The runes on the axe intertwined and emitted a bright light. The light formed a projection in the air.</p><p>that’s the night Demon King and the dark ice Race!</p><p>Lu Ming saw the shadow of the night Demon Lord on the projection at one glance.</p><p>&Nbsp; moreover, there were a few figures next to the night Demon Lord, all of them from the dark ice Race.</p><p>Lu Ming had seen people from the dark ice Clan before, so he could recognize them at a glance.</p><p>However, both the night Demon Lord and the dark ice Race were very respectful to these figures.</p><p>Those figures were covered in black robes, and their faces could not be seen clearly.</p><p>“This time, we’ll arrange it well. At that time, we’ll hide the nine absolute divine crystal with your dark ice Clan!”</p><p>One of the black-robed men said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. They were indeed discussing the matter of stealing the nine ultimate divine crystal.</p><p>The dark ice Race members and the night Demon King naturally bowed.</p><p>The few of them discussed for a while more about the specific matters of stealing the nine absolute God crystal. Unfortunately, from the beginning to the end, they did not know the identities of the few black-robed men.</p><p>“The nine absolute divine crystal is indeed with the dark ice Clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he looked happy.</p><p>Although he didn’t know who was the one that was colluding with the dark ice Clan, he had finally found the whereabouts of the nine absolute divine crystal. As long as he could exterminate the dark ice Clan and take back the nine absolute divine crystal, the Qin heaven star field would be fine.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“What do we do? Of course, we’re going to use this projection to make it public!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It’s too easy. Maybe we can make a plan to draw out the forces that are working with the dark ice Clan and catch them all!”</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile.</p><p>“Lure out the mastermind? I also want to, but is there any way?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>this, you have to think about it yourself. I’m just suggesting!</p><p>LAN Shang chuckled like an old fox.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. However, at the next moment, his eyes lit up. He had thought of a way.</p><p>When Lu Ming first came to the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, he was intercepted by a group of people.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, the other party had probably guessed that there was evidence in the storage ring of the night Demon King.</p><p>However, the other party might not know what the evidence left behind by the night Demon Lord was.</p><p>The two of them might not know that the evidence left behind by the night Demon Lord only exposed the dark ice Race, but not the mastermind.</p><p>The other party was not clear about it. That was why they were in a hurry to kill Lu Ming and take away the evidence.</p><p>Therefore, based on this point, perhaps he could use the evidence left behind by the night Demon King to lure him out or blackmail him into admitting it.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming suspected that the person behind this could very well be the Jin family or the Qin family.</p><p>This was because after Lu Ming came to the star sky Camp, he had been targeted by these two families and they wanted to kill him at every turn.</p><p>&Nbsp; perhaps the other party wanted to kill him and take the night Demon King’s storage ring.</p><p>“In that case, I might be able to make use of this matter regarding Yi Xiang …”</p><p>Many thoughts ran through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Lu Ming suspected that Yi Xiang had joined forces with the Jin and Qin families to lure him out and then kill him.</p><p>In that case, could he beat them at their own game, make the matter big, and then blackmail the other party, making the other party give himself away?</p><p>However, in order to carry out this plan, he needed a powerful force to support him. Otherwise, he would be killed by the other party before the plan could even be carried out.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming told LAN Shang about soaring wing and his plan.</p><p>“Not bad, not bad. This is a good method …”</p><p>After LAN Shang heard that, he nodded his head repeatedly. He looked at Lu Ming with a more satisfied gaze.</p><p>To be able to think of such a method in such a short time, it was not something that ordinary people could do.</p><p>To reverse Jing Yu’s verdict, one not only needed strength, but also brains. Without brains, one would not be able to go far.</p><p>alright, let’s follow this plan. Your safety will be in your uncle Lan’s hands!</p><p>LAN Shang smiled, full of confidence.</p><p>however, if you want to make a big deal out of this, I can’t do it alone. Don’t you have a good relationship with the Wu family? you can go and borrow their power!</p><p>Then, LAN Shang reminded him.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He then discussed the details of the plan with LAN Shang and left the place.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming looked for Wu Ming and Wu Yue and told them about his plan.</p><p>alright, leave this matter to us. We’ll send the news to young master Zifeng right away!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>Wu Ming immediately sent a message to Wu Zifeng.</p><p>Not long after, Wu Ming received a reply.</p><p>brother Lu, don’t worry. The family head has said that he will do his best to help you. If necessary, the family head will personally take action!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>With the woo family’s help, the plan could be carried out smoothly.</p><p>“Yi Xiang, I’m going to take your life!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>……</p><p>The soaring cloud District was the largest commercial district in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>Here, the streets crisscrossed and the shops formed a forest. A large number of people gathered here, and it was extremely prosperous.</p><p>The inn within the clouds was the largest restaurant in the soaring cloud District, and it was also a place of romance.</p><p>The tower in the clouds, as its name suggested, floated in the clouds all year round and covered a large area.</p><p>Anyone who drank here would have a young and beautiful lady to accompany them. The fine wine and delicious food were also top-notch, so it naturally attracted a large number of customers.</p><p>The tower in the clouds had three floors and was very large. The luxurious tables and chairs were almost all occupied by guests.</p><p>On one of the tables and chairs, Yi Xiang was drinking with a few friends.</p><p>They were accompanied by a beautiful woman.</p><p>Yi Xiang was hugging a young woman, causing her to giggle.</p><p>“Hahaha, come, beauty, have a drink with me!”</p><p>Yi Xiang laughed and raised his cup, asking the woman to drink.</p><p>“This servant won’t be polite with young master Yi Xiang’s wine!”</p><p>The woman took the glass and drank it in one go.</p><p>“Good, good alcohol tolerance!”</p><p>Yi Xiang clapped his hands and praised, acting arrogantly.</p><p>However, every now and then, a sharp glint would flash in the depths of his eyes as he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I hope that you will appear. Once you appear, it will be the day of your death!”</p><p>Yi Xiang roared in his heart, his killing intent boundless.</p><p>Previously, he was afraid of Lu Ming and hid in the winged ones ‘family. He did not even dare to return to the star sky Battalion. This incident had already become a laughing stock for him.</p><p>He hated Lu Ming to the core.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
