Their attacks collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud explosion. Lu Ming’s body swayed slightly, while the figure was sent flying.</p><p>“This is … This kind of fluctuation …”</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was delighted and his eyes lit up.</p><p>In the exchange of blows just now, Lu Ming could clearly feel that his opponent was completely condensed from the origin divine energy of the ruler’s divine power. In the collision, Lu Ming could feel the mystery of the origin divine energy even more clearly.</p><p>no wonder, no wonder. Is this the purpose of the first row of stone platforms? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The first row of stone platforms was for direct combat with the corresponding divine power of the origin. This way, the effect would naturally be much better.</p><p>Previously, he had only been watching. Now, he was fighting directly, so the effect was naturally different.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, many figures were rushing over from all directions.</p><p>“Come on! Come on …”</p><p>Lu Ming was excited. He waved his long spear and rushed forward.</p><p>In such a battle, not only could he experience the origin divine power personally, but he could also hone his various divine skills and secret skills. This was Lu Ming’s favorite method.</p><p>Lu Ming was also fighting with dozens of figures formed by the divine power of the origin.</p><p>In the beginning, Lu Ming was completely outmatched.</p><p>Fortunately, the injuries he sustained here would heal quickly and would not harm his body.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming focused on cultivation.</p><p>Outside, outside the stone platform, in the crowd, Jin Xing, Qin Wukong, and the others were looking at Lu Ming, who was cultivating, with cold eyes.</p><p>“What do we do? Are we just going to let this kid continue to live his life?”</p><p>One of the Qin family members gritted his teeth and was extremely unhappy.</p><p>now, in star-moon ancient city, the only person in the Jin and Qin families who can kill this kid is brother Jinyuan!</p><p>Qin Wukong said.</p><p>that’s right. You guys wait here. I’ll look for cousin Jin Yuan and get him to kill Lu Ming!</p><p>Jin Xing gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>but brother Jinyuan, haven’t you already been cultivating there for three years? you can’t continue to challenge it!</p><p>One of the Qin clan’s elites said.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you can’t challenge him. We can wait outside. When the three years are up, he will naturally come down. At that time, we can just kill him!”</p><p>Jin Xing said coldly.</p><p>“Good idea. Let’s do it this way. We’ll keep watch here. Brother Jin Yuan, I’ll have to trouble brother Jin Xing!”</p><p>Qin Wukong said.</p><p>“Alright, you guys wait for my good news!”</p><p>After Jin Xing finished speaking, his figure flashed and he left.</p><p>Time flew by, and the days went by.</p><p>People from the myriad God Cliff’s vicinity would come and go every day.</p><p>He came and left, left and came again.</p><p>However, many people were very surprised when they saw Lu Ming in the first row.</p><p>“Isn’t that Lu Ming? I remember that he’s only a fourth level heavenly deity, but he’s actually able to sit in the first row?”</p><p>Some people were curious.</p><p>not a fourth level celestial deity, it’s a fifth level celestial deity now. Furthermore, his combat strength is extremely terrifying and completely can’t be measured with ordinary people!</p><p>The person who had seen Lu Ming’s moves said.</p><p>“Hehe, extremely terrifying? What a joke. How terrifying could a fifth level celestial deity be? The way I see it, it’s you trash, right? to actually let a fifth level celestial deity seize the first row’s throne!”</p><p>A golden-robed young man sneered, his face full of mockery.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s words had scolded everyone who had seen Lu Ming fight before, including Qin Wukong.</p><p>“So you’re going to challenge him?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>“Of course, the throne in the first row is mine!”</p><p>The Golden-robed youth laughed, his face full of confidence.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The others nodded and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>The gold-robed young man had already scolded them, so they naturally wouldn’t say anything more. They would go and remind the gold-robed young man.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had been cultivating for three months. The light screen on his body flashed and Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>ninety-eight percent. As expected, the further I progress, the slower the improvement!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>After three months of cultivation, the degree of awakening of Lu Ming’s ruler’s divine power had reached 98%.</p><p>The effects of the first row of seats were extremely good, but the difficulty of the subsequent upgrades was getting higher and higher.</p><p>If he were to cultivate in the lower rows, the degree of awakening would probably be far from 98%.</p><p>I’ve been cultivating for a year. Two more years should be enough for me to awaken!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. At this moment, he suddenly felt a powerful aura pressing down on him.</p><p>Then, he saw a young man in a golden robe land in front of him.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned and asked.</p><p>Initially, he thought that after he had defeated Qin Wukong, no one would dare to challenge him anymore. He did not expect that there would be someone who was stubborn.</p><p>of course. I wasn’t around before, so you were able to cultivate in the first row for a while. Consider it your good fortune. Now, get out of my sight!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man shouted coldly, and a powerful aura emanated from his body. He was extremely arrogant.</p><p>Half-step Divine King realm. This golden-robed young man’s cultivation base was not weak. He had reached the half-step Divine King realm. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>However, the degree of his divine power awakening was far from enough. It was only about fifty percent. Compared to Qin Wukong, he was far inferior.</p><p>Outside, many people had mocking smiles on their faces, as if they were watching a good show.</p><p>This person still wanted to challenge Lu Ming. Was he not looking for abuse?</p><p>However, this person was too arrogant, and no one warned him.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and suddenly shouted, ” “Get lost!”</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of his body and charged toward the Golden-robed young man.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s expression changed. He said gloomily, ” “Lu Ming, don’t think that you can be arrogant in front of me just because you have some talent. Now is not the time for you to be arrogant. I’ve already given you a chance. You’re the one who refused to get lost. I can only make you get lost personally!”</p><p>With that, the young man in the gold robe moved and charged toward Lu Ming, launching a fierce attack.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out an ancient God’s roar. His body quickly enlarged and transformed into an ancient God Body. Then, he swept his spear out.</p><p>&Nbsp; boom boom boom …</p><p>The long spear crushed the Golden-robed young man’s attack and instantly shattered it. The terrifying spear radiance continued to lash at the Golden-robed young man.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The Golden-robed young man roared with a look of disbelief on his face. He then used all his strength to block.</p><p>However, when the long spear struck down, the Golden-robed young man screamed in pain. All his defenses were instantly shattered, and he was sent flying by the long spear.</p><p>However, before he could fly out of the stone platform, a few ice chains flew over and wrapped around the Golden-robed young man. Then, they were waved and thrown onto the stone platform.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Golden-robed young man kept smashing onto the stone platform. Lu Ming had deliberately controlled it. Every time, it was the Golden-robed young man’s face that smashed onto the stone platform.</p><p>The Golden-robed young man’s teeth and blood flew out, and his face was smashed into a deformed shape.</p><p>“Who asked you to be so arrogant, you deserve it!”</p><p>Many people muttered, but they still felt a chill.</p><p>Lu Ming was too violent!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
