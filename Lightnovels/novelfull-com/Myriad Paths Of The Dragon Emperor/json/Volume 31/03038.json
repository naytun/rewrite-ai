The soul of a heaven’s favorite is indeed different. It tastes so good, hehehe!</p><p>The young man from the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion laughed excitedly with an intoxicated look on his face.</p><p>“Oh, really? It’s my turn!”</p><p>At this moment, another heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion had a look of anticipation in his eyes. His figure flashed and he pounced on the young men.</p><p>The young men were shocked and quickly retreated, trying to avoid it.</p><p>However, the heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor was extremely fast. In a flash, he had arrived in front of the young man and launched an attack.</p><p>The outcome of these young men was the same as the young men before him. Their souls were drawn out while they screamed in pain, and then they were swallowed by the young men from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>cool, it’s really cool. It’s much better than those ordinary souls!</p><p>The young man from the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion looked at the crowd with a cold gaze as if he was looking at the geniuses as prey.</p><p>The paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine blades Heavenly King mansion all turned pale and retreated. They did not even look at the people who were close to the nine nether Heavenly King.</p><p>“You guys … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar was heard.</p><p>The person who spoke was Chu baxing.</p><p>Just now, two of the youths that the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor had killed were Chu BA Xing’s clansmen.</p><p>At this moment, the golden light on his body was thick, and a violent aura was constantly spreading out.</p><p>He had wanted to deal with Lu Ming, but the people from the abysmal Heavenly King Manor killed two of his clansmen as soon as they arrived. This infuriated him and he turned his attention to the elites from the abysmal Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>“Brat, I’ll kill those kids first, then I’ll deal with you!”</p><p>Chu baxing cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. With a twist of his body, he turned into a golden rainbow and rushed towards a heaven’s favorite from the abysmal Heavenly King mansion. Before he even arrived, a dazzling spear light was already stabbing towards the other party.</p><p>“Finally, something interesting, hehe!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace chuckled, and his body twisted even more. Ghostly Qi filled the air, and a pitch-black ghostly claw formed, grabbing towards Chu baxing.</p><p>The ghostly claw was filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>There was no doubt that this heaven’s favorite from the residence of the nine serenity Heavenly King was also an existence that had awakened origin divine power.</p><p>In reality, a total of three youths from the abysmal Heavenly King Manor had come. All of them had awakened the origin divine power factor and were one of the strongest geniuses below the divine King of the abysmal Heavenly King Manor. That was why they had arrived first.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The dazzling spear radiance collided with the ghostly claw, causing a violent boom.</p><p>Then, the ghost claw trembled violently and collapsed. However, after the ghost claw collapsed, it turned into a strange energy and actually rushed towards Chu baxing’s body along with the spear light.</p><p>Chu baxing’s expression changed and he let out an angry roar. The golden light on his body brightened and he continuously attacked, finally breaking away from this strange energy.</p><p>“A heaven’s favorite who has awakened the origin divine power factor. Your soul must be delicious. Hehehe, then I, you han, want your soul!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor cried out coldly. With a sinister smile, his figure flickered and he charged towards Chu baxing.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, the ghostly Qi on you Han’s body grew and spread out like a black mist, shrouding Chu baxing.</p><p>Within the ghostly Qi, ghostly wails and wolf howls could be heard. Some of these figures were mournful, some were sorrowful, and they were extremely cold. Anyone who heard them would feel their heart beating faster and their divine souls trembling as if their souls were about to jump out.</p><p>“This attack can affect the soul. Retreat!”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically as they retreated, putting a sufficient distance between them and you han.</p><p>Chu BA Xing was clearly greatly affected, and the golden light on his body trembled.</p><p>“Nine nether ghostclaw!”</p><p>die! you han shouted at this time. An ice-cold ghostly claw grabbed towards Chu baxing, trying to pull his soul out.</p><p>“God of War’s strike!”</p><p>Chu baxing roared and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>Suddenly, an extremely huge God of War appeared in the sky and stabbed at you han.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear of the God of War pierced the ghost claw. The ghost claw immediately collapsed and turned into mist, filling the air.</p><p>interesting. Clansman of the war god clan, your soul must be even more delicious. Nine nether prison!</p><p>You han let out a sharp cry. His body turned into a ghostly shadow with a bang and blended into the black mist. The black mist spread and enveloped Chu BA Xing and the giant God of War.</p><p>you want to deal with me with unorthodox methods? in your dreams! Kill, kill, kill!</p><p>Chu baxing roared. The giant war god swept his spear in an attempt to sweep away the mist.</p><p>However, the mist was so thick that it couldn’t be swept away. Once it was swept away, it would gather again.</p><p>Furthermore, within the mist, ghostly wails and wolf howls rang out continuously, affecting Chu baxing’s soul.</p><p>The two of them fought in the mist, and for a moment, Chu BA Xing was at a disadvantage.</p><p>the attack of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion is so strange. It directly affects the soul, which is somewhat similar to the wizard blood!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>The witch’s blood and the attacks used by his fellow apprentices could affect the soul. The only difference was that the witch’s blood and the others used poisonous gas.</p><p>As for the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor, no one knew what methods they had used.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Within the fog, a violent collision occurred. Not long after, the huge war god that Chu baxing had condensed exploded. Chu baxing’s figure retreated madly, until he was out of the fog’s scope. His figure trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Chu baxing was injured.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Everyone was well aware of how powerful Chu baxing was. When he fought Jin Yuan earlier, he had the upper hand, and even Jin Yuan was no match for him.</p><p>But now, he had been beaten to the point of spitting blood by you han. How could you han be so strong?</p><p>“The descendant of the God of War is nothing more than this. Hehe, prepare to die!”</p><p>You Han’s figure moved and he pounced towards Chu baxing.</p><p>“Brother Chu, let me help you!”</p><p>Si Ji said as he unsheathed his saber. A bright Saber Light slashed towards you han.</p><p>Wherever the blade light passed, the mist that you han had turned into would roll continuously, but it would quickly gather again.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing caught his breath and charged towards you han again with a dazzling golden light. The huge spear radiance was even bigger than a mountain, as if it was going to pierce through the void.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Chu BA Xing and Si Ji’s combined attack was too terrifying. Explosions continuously occurred in the air, forming powerful shock waves.</p><p>The mist that you han had turned into was finally unable to hold on and scattered.</p><p>With a flash of light, you Han’s figure appeared not far away.</p><p>“Two against one, are you bullying the few of us? I’ll fight with you!”</p><p>Another young man from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion stepped out, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>no need. You guys just watch from the side. I alone am enough to deal with the two of them!</p><p>You han waved his hand and stopped the genius from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
