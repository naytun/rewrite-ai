Lu Ming shouted angrily. The Spear’s gleam expanded and his aura burst out like a flood.</p><p>A crescent-shaped spearlight slashed towards you Lian.</p><p>However, you Lian’s figure flickered and twisted like a ghost. He dodged Lu Ming’s attack by a hair’s breadth and continued to pounce on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break the air, break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear trembled and then suddenly stabbed out. In an instant, he had stabbed more than ten times.</p><p>More than a dozen spear radiances shot towards you Lian like shooting stars, sealing off the space around him.</p><p>Facing this attack, you Lian could only take it head on.</p><p>“Nine nether ghostclaw!”</p><p>You Lian shouted coldly. He struck out with his claw. A ghostly claw appeared and grabbed onto the spear radiance. The spear radiance trembled non-stop before it collapsed. You Lian’s figure flashed and he appeared in front of Lu Ming. He clawed at Lu Ming so quickly that Lu Ming almost could not react in time.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had already cast the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor to cover his entire body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>You Lian’s ghostly claw landed on the nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor, causing it to tremble.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and activated the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor to its maximum. The divine power in his body rushed madly toward the armor.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>You Lian’s ghostly claw struck the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor. In an instant, a finger pierced through it. However, it was not easy as it was met with great resistance.</p><p>“Your Shen power, what’s going on?”</p><p>You Lian’s expression changed. He sensed carefully and screamed again, ” your divine power! So many divine-grade divine powers! You can actually control so many divine-grade divine powers? ”</p><p>You Lian cried out in disbelief.</p><p>His nine netherworld ghostclaw kept clashing with Lu Ming’s nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor. He could truly feel that Lu Ming could control many types of divine-grade divine energy. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>“Even with so many divine powers, you can’t stop me!”</p><p>You Lian shrieked, and a ghostly wail rang out from his body. His ghostly claw glowed with a black light, piercing through Lu Ming’s nine layers of Scarlet Gold armor and clawing at Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>An ear-piercing sound was heard as the nine netherworld ghostclaw scratched the green scales. The scales were torn apart, and blood stains appeared.</p><p>This was not the scariest thing. The scariest thing was that there was a strange force on the nine netherworld ghostclaw that passed through Lu Ming’s physical body and rushed toward his soul, causing his soul to tremble.</p><p>When the soul trembled, the control of the divine power would weaken. Lu Ming’s aura trembled and weakened a little.</p><p>You Lian seized the opportunity and grabbed a piece of flesh from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a roar and retreated a few hundred meters, putting some distance between him and you Lian.</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t expect you to control so many divine-grade divine powers. No wonder you’re so powerful. Kid, tell me the method you’re cultivating!</p><p>You Lian laughed out loud and then stared at Lu Ming with a look of greed.</p><p>He felt that Lu Ming must have cultivated an unparalleled technique that allowed him to control so many divine-grade divine powers. If he could get his hands on such a technique that seized the good fortune of the heavens and earth, he would definitely soar to the sky and become a peerless genius, the brightest star in the sky.</p><p>His heart was burning with passion.</p><p>“You want my technique? fine, let’s see if you have the ability to do so!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his eyes flashing with killing intent.</p><p>You Lian knew his secret, so he had to die. This matter must not be spread.</p><p>“Brat, don’t think that I can’t kill you. Die!”</p><p>You Lian shrieked. In a flash, he charged towards Lu Ming again. His aura was slightly stronger than before. Clearly, you Lian had already used all his strength.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar rang out continuously. Lu Ming cast the divine Dragon materialization art while brandishing his long spear, fighting against you Lian.</p><p>However, you Lian’s body movement technique was extremely strange. Moreover, his body did not seem to be made of flesh and blood. Lu Ming’s attack did not seem to cause much damage to him.</p><p>Every time you Lian’s attack landed on Lu Ming, his soul spirit would tremble.</p><p>With his soul trembling, Lu Ming could not exert 100% of his strength. After a few dozen moves, there were a few more wounds on Lu Ming’s body, and he was bleeding.</p><p>“Old Liang, can’t you absorb that strange energy of his?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>The other party’s main problem was that the power that affected the soul was too strange. It was impossible to guard against and it caused Lu Ming to be unable to unleash 100% of his abilities.</p><p>Without the influence of this energy, Lu Ming was not afraid of the other party and could even defeat him.</p><p>After dozens of battles, Lu Ming realized that the other party was not immune to his attacks. It was just that his body movements were strange and he could dissipate a portion of the power.</p><p>Lu Ming’s energy attack could still cause damage to the other party.</p><p>In particular, the divine power that had awakened the origin divine power factor was even more harmful to the other party.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had no way to deal with the energy that the other party used to attack the soul. He could only seek help from the quantity formula.</p><p>“We can’t!”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the ” quantity ” formula answered him directly.</p><p>“You can’t? You can even absorb the poisonous gas that affected my soul with the witch’s blood? Why can’t I?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that kind of poisonous gas is just a kind of unconscious energy. Naturally, I can absorb it. However, this person’s attack contains his own will and is completely under the control of the other party. Naturally, I can’t absorb it!</p><p>if I can absorb it, doesn’t that mean I can directly absorb the divine power of others? ”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula asked.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Indeed, the Sorcerer’s blood had only used a type of poisonous gas. You Lian’s power, on the other hand, was a strange divine power that contained you Lian’s will.</p><p>Just like what the ” measure ” formula had said, if he could even absorb this, then when Lu Ming encountered an enemy, he just had to release the ” measure ” formula. Wouldn’t he be able to directly devour the other party’s divine power?</p><p>It was obvious that the quantity formula could not do it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, you Lian attacked Lu Ming again, causing his soul to tremble and almost making him lose control of his divine power.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>You Lian clawed at Lu Ming again, tearing off a large piece of flesh.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure retreated.</p><p>hehehe, go to hell. I, you Lian, am really lucky to actually be able to obtain a Supreme technique!</p><p>You Lian laughed coldly as if killing Lu Ming was a sure thing.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Lu Ming kept thinking of countermeasures in his mind.</p><p>kid, you can only rely on yourself now. Take a look and see if you have any treasures that can resist soul attacks!</p><p>The quantity formula said irresponsibly.</p><p>“What kind of treasure can resist soul attacks?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s brain was spinning rapidly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
