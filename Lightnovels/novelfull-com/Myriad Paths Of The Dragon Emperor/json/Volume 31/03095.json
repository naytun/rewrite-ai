He wanted to rush out with the rest of the clan, but a strong and hot wave of air surged toward him.</p><p>It was the patriarch of the red flame clan. He threw a punch at the patriarch of the ice Soul Clan with a burning fist force.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan shouted. An ice sword appeared in his hand, and he slashed at the fist force of the Scarlet Flame clan’s clan leader.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ice sword hit the fist force and a violent boom was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The ice sword trembled violently and madly before finally exploding with a bang.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was also knocked back by a terrifying force. His body crashed into a Glacier, and the entire Glacier exploded.</p><p>.com</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Fourth level of the divine King realm. You’ve broken through to the fourth level of the divine King realm? how is that possible?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan shouted in disbelief.</p><p>He and the patriarch of the Scarlet Flame clan had fought for countless years and knew each other very well.</p><p>Whether it was talent or strength, the Scarlet Flame clan’s patriarch was on par with him. It was impossible for him to break through to the fourth level of Godking realm so quickly.</p><p>Now, his opponent’s cultivation base was actually at the fourth level of Godking realm. How could he not be shocked?</p><p>“What? Fourth level of God King realm!”</p><p>“My God! The patriarch of the Scarlet Flame clan has broken through to the fourth level of the divine King realm!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s expressions changed drastically. Many of them turned pale.</p><p>In the past, the two clans had a fourth level Divine King realm expert each. In terms of top-tier combat strength, the two clans were equal. However, the Scarlet Flame clan was slightly stronger in overall strength. The ice Soul Clan could still resist.</p><p>But now, the red flame clan had two fourth level Divine King realm experts. They had the upper hand in terms of top combat strength. The balance had been tilted. This was a disaster for the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>hahaha, I told you. The ice Soul Clan will be destroyed today!</p><p>The chief of the Scarlet Flame tribe laughed wildly. He was extremely excited and arrogant.</p><p>He was especially happy when he saw the despair in the eyes of the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you so soon. I’ll kill Lu Ming first, then all the ice Soul Clan members. I’ll let you know what despair is. Hahaha!”</p><p>The patriarch of the red flame clan laughed wildly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>you’re courting death! the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan roared. He spat out another mouthful of blood in anger.</p><p>The difference between a third level Divine King and a fourth level Divine King was too great. The attack just now had already severely injured the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>“Let’s get the nine absolute divine crystal first. Lu Ming, tell me, is the nine absolute divine crystal in your hands?”</p><p>The Dean of the winged demon Academy looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Yes, it’s in my hands!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and a small purple-gold box appeared in his hand. He picked it up and waved it before speaking indifferently.</p><p>His face was calm from the beginning to the end.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze was immediately attracted by the small box in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>“Principal, I will go and get the nine absolute God crystal!”</p><p>“Sect leader, I will go and get the nine absolute God crystal!”</p><p>“Chief …”</p><p>At this moment, the experts from the unique demon Academy, the immortal sword sect, the boundless Holy Land, and the red flame tribe all stepped out and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>They all wanted to get the nine absolute God crystal. Whoever got the nine absolute God crystal and handed it over would definitely get a bigger reward.</p><p>These forces had already started to compete.</p><p>A total of eight experts from the four major forces pounced at Lu Ming. All of them were at the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>As for the divine kings, they had yet to make a move. There was no need for a Divine King to make a move to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>“Saint …”</p><p>Yue Wuya and the other elders of the Kong Xuan sect were shocked. They wanted to help Lu Ming, but the auras of the godkings from the unique devil Academy and the immortal sword sect had locked onto them. If they moved, they would be struck by lightning.</p><p>don’t attack! These cats and dogs can’t do anything to me!</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. His voice was calm, but it was vaguely filled with disdain.</p><p>When these words reached the ears of the experts of the major forces, they were furious.</p><p>“A heavenly God Realm junior, an ant-like thing, courting death!”</p><p>arrogant! Let’s see what you can do to be arrogant!</p><p>The half-step divine kings that charged at Lu Ming all roared in anger. They used all sorts of methods and attacks to envelop Lu Ming.</p><p>The eight half-step divine kings attacked together with shocking power. Even a true Divine King would have to treat them with caution, let alone a heavenly God junior.</p><p>However, in Lu Ming’s eyes, these people could not even withstand one blow.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>dragon roar! Lu Ming mumbled and cast the divine Dragon materialization technique. He pressed his hands in the air, and the roars of Dragons reverberated through the world.</p><p>Nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed one after another.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The first nine-clawed Divine Dragon that was formed roared and pounced on the fastest half-step Divine King. It waved its claw and destroyed the opponent’s attack. Then, under the opponent’s shocked eyes, the Dragon Claw grabbed the opponent’s body and squeezed it. With a shrill scream, the half-step Divine King was crushed to death.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>A half-step Divine King was actually killed so easily.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the second nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced on the second person.</p><p>Just like the person before him, this half-step Divine King was also vulnerable. His body was torn apart by the nine-clawed Divine Dragon, and his miserable shrieks reverberated throughout the entire scene.</p><p>“Not good, quickly retreat!”</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>The remaining six people who were pouncing on Lu Ming had a drastic change in expression. They were almost scared out of their wits and retreated frantically.</p><p>“You want to retreat now? what a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s speed was extremely shocking. In the blink of an eye, it had rushed behind those people and began a terrifying killing.</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>A few more were killed in succession.</p><p>This scene shocked everyone present.</p><p>Some people who knew Lu Ming were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was merely a junior, yet he had such powerful combat strength that he could easily kill a half-step Divine King. This kind of strength was too terrifying.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>die! furious roars were heard from the indestructible sword sect in the Yimo Academy. Two figures charged out, and a terrifying pressure spread out in all directions.</p><p>God King!</p><p>The true divine kings had made their moves. Two first level divine kings.</p><p>The two of them rushed forward in an attempt to stop Lu Ming. However, they were still a step too slow. By the time they arrived, the eight half-step divine kings were all dead.</p><p>“Ah, brat, I’m going to skin you alive and pull out your tendons!”</p><p>“I’m going to make you beg for death!”</p><p>The two godkings roared and charged at Lu Ming furiously. The terrifying pressure caused the void to tremble continuously.</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed drastically. The might of a Godking was so terrifying!</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yue Wuya and the others were filled with worry. However, at this moment, they wanted to make a move, but they were locked onto by the experts of the other side. Once they made a move, they would probably face a chaotic battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
