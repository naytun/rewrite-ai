His divine power burned like a flame as he slashed at Lu Ming more than ten times in a row. Each blade light seemed to be able to cut through the void. The power was terrifying.</p><p>More than ten saber lights enveloped Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Wu zixiong couldn’t help but shout to remind him. Before this, he was defeated by this move and was injured by this move.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Dragon roars continued to ring out as Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons emerged above Lu Ming’s head. Dragon Qi soared into the sky as their huge bodies twisted and turned, pouncing toward the saber-wielding young man.</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon’s energy construct stomped with its dragon claws, continuously bombarding the saber-wielding young man’s saber-light.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued. In the end, the saber-wielding young man’s saber-light trembled violently and collapsed one after another. The divine Dragon phenomenon did not stop and continued to charge at the other party.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man could not believe that his all-out attack could not take down Lu Ming. Not only that, but his attack was also crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Heavenly blade art, slash the world!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared and used all his remaining strength to slash out with his saber.</p><p>After dozens of consecutive slashes, the saber-hugging young man finally blocked the attack of the nine-clawed Divine Dragon phenomenon and defeated it.</p><p>However, the saber-hugging young man himself kept retreating. He retreated a few thousand meters, and then his face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>“The origin divine power factor, you’ve awakened the origin divine power factor. Impossible, impossible … How did you manage to awaken the divine power factor?”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared madly with a look of disbelief.</p><p>A fifth level celestial deity actually awakened the origin divine power factor. What kind of freak was this?</p><p>He was not the only one. The other three young men and women beside the chariot were also dumbfounded. They stared at Lu Ming with their mouths agape.</p><p>In the exchange just now, Lu Ming’s divine power exuded an ancient aura. There was no mistake. He had definitely awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Wu zixiong, Wu Ming, and Wu Yue were also tongue-tied, completely stunned and in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually awakened the origin divine power factor?</p><p>They clearly remembered that when they first entered star-moon ancient city, Lu Ming’s abilities were far inferior to his current abilities. There was a huge difference between them.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming was surrounded by a few Qin family experts and it was very dangerous. In the end, he had to rely on them to get him out of the situation.</p><p>But now, not only had Lu Ming’s cultivation increased by one level, but he had also awakened the origin divine power factor and his combat strength had soared.</p><p>This kind of improvement speed could only be described as abnormal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura burst out from the chariot. It was obvious that the being inside the chariot was not calm either.</p><p>interesting, interesting. A fifth-level heavenly deity has awakened the origin divine power factor. I didn’t expect the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion to have such a person!</p><p>The being in the chariot sighed, then his voice turned cold. “Very good. A chosen like him is perfect to feed my li beast. Hahaha, the three of you, attack together and kill him. No, cripple him first!”</p><p>“Yes, young master!”</p><p>Outside the chariot, the other three men received the order and unsheathed their sabers at the same time. In a flash, they surrounded Lu Ming, Wu Ming, and the rest.</p><p>At the same time, the saber-wielding youth also stepped back, his expression extremely cold.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually forced him to retreat and embarrassed him in front of young master. Lu Ming deserved to die!</p><p>The faces of Wu Ming and the others changed once again.</p><p>Although Lu Ming could force the saber-hugging youth to retreat, could he defeat the four of them when they joined forces?</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared and took the lead to attack. The saber-light broke through the air and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The other three also attacked at the same time. Divine power exploded, and a terrifying blade was slashed out.</p><p>They were all half-step divine kings and their divine powers had awakened to about fifty percent.</p><p>He didn’t know the identity of the person in the chariot, but there were four such geniuses who were so respectful to him.</p><p>The saber Light from all directions enveloped Lu Ming, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party wanted to get rid of Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Wu zixiong roared and prepared to fight back, they could not just sit and wait for death.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard. At the same time, nine ice chains flew out and surrounded Wu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The saber Light kept slashing at the ice chains, but the ice chains did not move at all. Not a single mark was left behind.</p><p>“Now, it’s my turn. Break the space, break the space …”</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands. The long spear vibrated and continuously pierced out.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than a dozen spear lights charged at the four people.</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes, sky piercer. This move was enhanced by Lu Ming’s divine power and the battle character formula that multiplied his combat power by four times. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>The saber-hugging young man and the other three slashed at Lu Ming’s spear ray one after another. Only then did they manage to block it.</p><p>However, the four of them kept retreating.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>After Lu Ming forced the saber-wielding teenager and the other three to retreat, he took a step forward and aimed at the saber-wielding teenager, his long spear striking down with all his might.</p><p>A crescent-shaped spear light slashed towards the saber-wielding young man.</p><p>The power of this move was naturally above that of the sky Splitter.</p><p>“Heavenly blade art …”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared and slashed with all his might, colliding with the crescent-shaped spear radiance.</p><p>With a violent boom, the saber-wielding youth’s Saber Light shattered. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and retreated.</p><p>However, the two ice chains wrapped around him at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared and wanted to jump away from the ice chains. However, Lu Ming slashed at him with the moon-cutting sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man continued to spit blood and retreat. The two ice chains took the opportunity to wrap around the young man and then tightened. The young man screamed as his bones were broken and twisted like a fried dough twist.</p><p>At the same time, a layer of cold air froze him, making him unable to move at all.</p><p>All of this seemed to take a long time to describe, but it actually happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming repelled the four experts with one move and then captured the saber-hugging teenager. All of this happened in the span of a breath.</p><p>“Don’t you like to feed other people’s lives to your dire beast? I wonder how it would feel to feed you with your life?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He controlled the ice chain and threw the saber-hugging teenager towards a dire beast that was pulling the chariot.</p><p>The saber-hugging young man’s eyes were filled with fear. He wanted to shout for help but he was frozen by Lu Ming and could not make a sound.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A ferocious wild beast saw someone flying towards it. It roared and opened its bloody mouth to bite the young man.</p><p>The young man was bitten in two.</p><p>Then, the wild beast chewed a few times and completely ate the saber-hugging young man.</p><p>He had caught others to feed the desolate beast, but he ended up dying in the mouth of the desolate beast.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The remaining three young men roared in anger, their faces filled with fear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
