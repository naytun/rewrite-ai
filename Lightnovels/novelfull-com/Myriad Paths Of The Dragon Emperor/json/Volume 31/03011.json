His vital point is that head. Let’s join forces and kill him!</p><p>The white-haired young man was a decisive man. Since he couldn’t escape, he could only risk his life.</p><p>The two of them came up with a plan through voice transmission.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two snow lions roared and used the lion’s roar technique. The air was overbearing and blew away a few vines. Then, the two rushed towards the vines ‘heads.</p><p>However, there were nine vines in total. Immediately, the rest of the vines shot towards the two frost Lions.</p><p>“I’ll block the vines, you go and kill him!”</p><p>At this moment, an Ice Snow Lion roared loudly. His entire body was burning with divine power. He opened his mouth and roared. One after another, Lions flew out from his mouth and charged towards the vines.</p><p>This was a secret technique that was condensed from divine power.</p><p>This frost Lion was going all out. It burned its divine power and activated a terrifying secret technique.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Lions rushed out one after another, slamming into the vines and actually temporarily pushing away the nine vines.</p><p>How could the white-haired young man miss such an opportunity?</p><p>His entire body glowed and he roared as he charged towards the head of the myriad rivers ice vine. He waved his sharp claws and streaks of claw radiance clawed at the head of the myriad rivers ice vine.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The myriad rivers ice vine roared and opened its mouth. Icicles shot out from its mouth and collided with the white-haired youth’s claw radiance.</p><p>At the same time, the ultimate cold gem on the head of the myriad river ice vine glowed. A white beam of light shot toward the white-haired youth.</p><p>This beam of light was extremely terrifying and its speed was shocking. Previously, even the absolute beauty and Lu Ming could not avoid it.</p><p>The white-haired young man naturally couldn’t avoid it and was hit by the White beam.</p><p>The white-haired youth’s body stiffened as soon as he was hit by the white light. A layer of ice crystals appeared on the surface of his body at an alarming speed.</p><p>The snow Lion cultivated divine power of the cold attribute and it controlled divine-grade divine power, but it could not block the cold air of the light beam.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The white-haired young man’s huge body fell to the ground, unable to move at all.</p><p>He wasn’t dead yet, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The other Snow Lion let out a furious roar.</p><p>However, there was only one Snow Lion left, and it was even less of a match for the ten thousand rivers ice vines. The nine ice vines danced wildly, attacking the snow Lion like a storm.</p><p>Soon, the snow Lion couldn’t hold on any longer. Its body was hit continuously and it was seriously injured.</p><p>“If we’re going to die, we’ll die together!”</p><p>The ice lion’s eyes were filled with madness as it charged towards the myriad river ice vine, its body emitting a blinding white light.</p><p>He was going to self-destruct!</p><p>In the next moment, with a terrifying explosion, the frost Lion self-destructed, and the terrifying energy swept through the entire underground space.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the beautiful woman’s slender waist. His figure flashed and he retreated far away. He set up layers of defense in front of him to offset the impact of the outside world.</p><p>The light dissipated, and the self-destructing Snow Lion had disappeared.</p><p>The white-haired youth who was frozen and on the verge of death had also completely fallen.</p><p>As for the myriad rivers ice vine, it was obviously injured as well. It was at the center of the explosion, and there were several big holes in its head. Its aura was much weaker.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The myriad rivers ice vine howled and glared at Lu Ming and the beautiful woman with its furious eyes. The nine vines danced and rushed toward Lu Ming and the beautiful woman.</p><p>“Good, I can make it!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. He suddenly let go of the beautiful woman and retreated quickly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming had just retreated when a powerful aura burst out from the beautiful woman.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally absorbed the last bit of cold air in the beautiful woman’s body. Once the cold air was absorbed, the beautiful woman’s powerful cultivation burst out in full force.</p><p>That was why Lu Ming had retreated in a hurry. Who knew if the absolute beauty would kill him after she recovered?</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s eyes were cold as she swept a glance at Lu Ming. In the end, her figure flashed and she charged at the myriad rivers ice vine.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted and sword light burst out one after another, aiming for the myriad river ice Vine’s head.</p><p>Because of the sub-core, the myriad rivers ice Vine’s strength was not as strong as before. Just now, it was injured by the snow lion’s self-explosion, so its strength had weakened a lot. In this way, it was no match for the beautiful woman at all.</p><p>As for the absolute beauty, all she had to do was to pay attention to the white light beam that the other party shot out.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The sword lights attacked the myriad river ice vine like a tide.</p><p>Some of the sword lights pushed the opponent’s vines away, while the rest of the sword lights hit the head of the myriad rivers ice vine, leaving sword wounds on its head.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The myriad rivers ice vine roared madly. It had no spiritual intelligence. Its head glowed and another beam of light flew out from the gem.</p><p>However, this time, the absolute beauty was already on guard. She was far enough away, and her figure flashed, avoiding the light beam.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>die! the beautiful woman shouted as she held her sword with both hands. A terrifying sword light shot into the sky.</p><p>Then, the sword light slashed at the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>The sword light was too powerful. It was the all-out attack of the absolute beauty. It directly swept away the nine vines and slashed at the head of the myriad rivers ice vine.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The myriad rivers ice Vine’s head was instantly split in half.</p><p>With this, the myriad rivers ice vine had completely fallen. Its huge corpse fell heavily to the ground.</p><p>After killing the myriad rivers ice vine, the absolute beauty turned around and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body tensed up and he was ready for a big battle.</p><p>“You saved my life this time, so I’ll spare you this time. Next time we meet, I won’t let you go. Remember, the one who killed you, LAN Ling!”</p><p>After leaving behind these cold words, the absolute beauty turned into a sword light and rushed into the passage, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>After the beautiful woman left, Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Fortunately, the absolute beauty still had some conscience and didn’t continue to kill him. Otherwise, he would have to prepare to escape again.</p><p>“LAN Ling, is that her name?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then shook his head and smiled bitterly. He had mixed feelings.</p><p>No one would be able to remain calm when a beautiful woman appeared out of nowhere and said that she wanted to marry him.</p><p>I have to improve my strength as soon as possible. Otherwise, I’ll be hunted down by this crazy woman again the next time I see her!</p><p>Lu Ming underestimated it and walked towards the myriad rivers ice vine.</p><p>The myriad rivers ice Vine’s head had been split in half by the Blue Spirit sword. Its sub-core had also been shattered by the destructive sword Qi. It couldn’t be more dead.</p><p>“Fortunately, the chilling gem is fine!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the gem on the head of the myriad rivers ice vine. It was still intact.</p><p>Fortunately, the angle of LAN Ling’s attack was slightly off. Otherwise, if the gemstone was shattered, Lu Ming would vomit blood.</p><p>In a flash, he appeared on the myriad rivers ice Vine’s head. Lu Ming took out a combat sword and removed the glacial gem from the myriad rivers ice Vine’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
