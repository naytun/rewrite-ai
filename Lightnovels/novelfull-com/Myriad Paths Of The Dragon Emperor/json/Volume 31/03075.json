When they saw the battle between Qiu Yue and LAN Ling, they were stunned.</p><p>The battle between two stunning beauties in the air was not only pleasing to the eye, but also extremely terrifying.</p><p>“WOWO, what terrifying strength!”</p><p>“The origin divine power factor. Both of them have awakened the origin divine power factor. My God, isn’t this too powerful? Who are they? they’re all so beautiful!”</p><p>I know. It’s a woman who seems to be the new member, Lu Ming. Back then, she entered star-moon ancient city and passed the sky Gate!</p><p>no way, right? at that time, she was only second level celestial deity. Now, she actually reached ninth level celestial deity. How did she cultivate like this? ”</p><p>“What a freak!”</p><p>Without a doubt, Qiu Yue’s cultivation had shocked everyone.</p><p>Some people even suspected that Qiu Yue had cultivated some sort of cultivation technique that concealed her cultivation level. When she first entered star-moon ancient city, she had concealed her cultivation level.</p><p>Above Star Peak, near the peak of Star Peak, there were some courtyards where the geniuses of the universal camp lived.</p><p>However, their cultivation was even more terrifying. Many of them had reached the divine King realm.</p><p>This was the most terrifying group of heaven’s favorites in the universal camp.</p><p>However, at this moment, these people were also alarmed. They flew out of the courtyard and watched from a distance.</p><p>“What beautiful women! What powerful strength!”</p><p>When these people saw it, they were also amazed.</p><p>To have such strength below the God King realm was a huge threat to them.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>Qiu Yue and LAN Ling were still fighting. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than a hundred moves.</p><p>Even though Qiu Yue’s cultivation was slightly weaker and was only at the ninth level of the celestial deity realm, she controlled many types of divine-grade divine energy, completely making up for her lack of cultivation.</p><p>Although Qiu Yue’s understanding of the divine skill was not as good as LAN Ling’s, she had the nine-colored divine light unique to the nine-orifice Saint heart, which would greatly increase her attack power.</p><p>For a moment, it was difficult to determine the winner between the two.</p><p>Initially, Qiu Yue was not very familiar with the control of Shen power. As the battle went on, Qiu Yue became more and more familiar with the control of Shen power. When she used it, she became more and more comfortable and her strength became stronger and stronger.</p><p>In the end, Qiu Yue was slowly gaining the upper hand.</p><p>“How could this be?”</p><p>At this moment, LAN Ling’s heart was filled with shock.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s strength was beyond her expectations. Not only could she fight with her, but she also had the upper hand.</p><p>What made her suffer the most was that Qiu Yue’s cultivation was still only at the ninth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>LAN Ling had always been invincible among those of the same level, and there were very few who could fight with her, let alone those with lower cultivation than her.</p><p>Her self-confidence had taken a heavy blow.</p><p>“God-destroying light!”</p><p>Suddenly, Qiu Yue muttered and cast the God destroying light.</p><p>Qiu Yue attached the God-destroying light to the scimitar and slashed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The blade hit LAN Ling’s combat sword, causing it to shake violently. The sword Qi on it was scattered. LAN Ling’s delicate body trembled and she was thrown back for 10000 meters. Blood trickled down from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“You’ve lost!”</p><p>Qiu Yue didn’t continue to pursue. She stood in the air and her clear voice rang out.</p><p>LAN Ling’s expression was extremely ugly. She bit her lips and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>Previously, she had questioned Qiu Yue’s qualifications to be by Lu Ming’s side. The facts had proven that Qiu Yue was more qualified than her.</p><p>“I lost, but in the future, I will definitely defeat you!”</p><p>LAN Ling said before turning around to leave. She no longer had the face to stay.</p><p>After LAN Ling left, Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. If LAN Ling insisted on staying in his courtyard, he would have a headache.</p><p>“Young master, it seems like another pretty lady is interested in you!”</p><p>Qiu Yue came to Lu Ming’s side and smiled.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Are you jealous?”</p><p>Lu Ming joked.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s face turned red. of course not. Young master is so outstanding. There must be many girls who like him. As long as Qiu Yue can be by young master’s side, I’ll be satisfied!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart felt warm. He held Qiu Yue’s hand and walked into the courtyard. After that, it was naturally another ‘fight’.</p><p>After that, LAN Ling did not come again. Lu Ming was happy to be idle. He was focused on cultivating in seclusion and comprehending the Overlord spear technique.</p><p>……</p><p>On the east side of the universal camp, there was a place rich in divine Qi. Large areas of luxurious palaces were built in this place.</p><p>This place was the Jin family’s headquarters in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>In a large hall, the head of the Jin clan, a few experts of the Jin clan, and Jin Yuan were discussing something.</p><p>The atmosphere in the main hall was very tense. The master of the Jin family was giving off a cold aura.</p><p>“I’ve only been in seclusion for a short while, and such a big thing has happened. Tell me, who killed Jin Xing? who has the guts to kill a heaven’s favorite of my Jin clan?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said in a deep voice. His voice seemed to contain a terrible storm.</p><p>Jin Xing, as one of the four heroes of the Jin clan, had a bright future ahead of him. But now, he was actually killed in the universal camp.</p><p>It would be a wonder if he wasn’t angry!</p><p>In front of the master of the Jin family, the proud Jin Yuan didn’t even dare to breathe loudly.</p><p>“Family head, the person who killed Jin Xing is a man called Lu Ming!”</p><p>Gold ingot answered honestly.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Which force is he from? there’s no Lu family in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family asked.</p><p>this person isn’t from any aristocratic family. He’s from the Qin heaven star system!</p><p>Gold ingot said.</p><p>“How could a person from the Qin heaven Starfield kill Jin Xing? also, since Jin Xing was killed, why didn’t you kill that brat to take revenge?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family stared at Jin Yuan coldly.</p><p>Gold ingot shuddered and broke out in a cold sweat. He answered honestly, ” “Clan head, if I were to attack, but … I’m not his match!”</p><p>“You’re not his match? There’s actually such a powerful genius in the Qin heaven star region?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family was slightly surprised.</p><p>this person is extremely monstrous. He’s only a fifth-level heavenly deity, but his combat strength is excessively strong. Not only did he defeat me, but he also defeated the other geniuses of the Heavenly King mansion and obtained a treasure …</p><p>Jin Yuan immediately told him everything that had happened in star-Moon City.</p><p>“There’s actually such a thing!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family and several experts of the Jin family were dumbfounded after hearing this.</p><p>They were truly shocked.</p><p>freak! This person must be a freak with great fortune. Once we offend someone like him, we must get rid of him!</p><p>The master of the Jin family said coldly.</p><p>however, the other party has been staying in the universal camp all this time. It’s not easy to make a move!</p><p>An old man from the Jin family frowned.</p><p>family head, elders, this Lu Ming is very close to the Wu family. In star-moon ancient city, the young master of the winged men, Yi Xiang, has offended Lu Ming. Lu Ming has always wanted to kill Yi Xiang. During this period of time, he has been asking the Wu family to find out about Yi Xiang’s whereabouts. This might be an opportunity …</p><p>Jin Yuan suggested.</p><p>The eyes of the master of the Jin family also lit up.”You mean you want to use Soaring Wings to lure Lu Ming out?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
