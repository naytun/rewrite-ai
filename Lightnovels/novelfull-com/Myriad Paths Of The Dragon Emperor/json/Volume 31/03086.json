Immediately, the Wu family and the three aristocratic families sent people to invite the Heavenly King divine guards. Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>Not much time had passed before streaks of rainbow light flew over from the distance.</p><p>The rainbow light receded, and a group of figures appeared in the sky.</p><p>A few of them were from the three major aristocratic families and the woo family. The other ten or so people were all middle-aged men wearing purple-gold armor. Their auras were as heavy as mountains.</p><p>The leader of the group was especially intimidating. He was like a war god who had been through hundreds of battles. His aura was not any weaker than the family heads.</p><p>It was very clear that this was also a peak Divine King.</p><p>“Commander Wang!”</p><p>“Long time no see, commander Wang!”</p><p>.com</p><p>The master of the Jin family and the others greeted him when they saw him.</p><p>Commander Wang nodded,”you said that there is evidence of the nine absolute God crystal being stolen, where is it?.”</p><p>“LAN Shang said it. He said he has evidence!”</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan said.</p><p>Commander Wang’s gaze turned to LAN Shang. He was slightly surprised and said, ” “LAN Shang, do you have any evidence?”</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>LAN Shang nodded, and then an ancient axe appeared in his hand.</p><p>this is my son-in-law, Lu Ming. He was in a place called Magic City mountain in chutian Galaxy. He obtained the storage ring of the Master of Magic City mountain, the night Demon King. This axe is in it!</p><p>there is a projection sealed in this axe. It records how the people of the Qin heaven Starfield colluded with the spies of the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor through the night Demon King and stole the nine absolute God crystal!</p><p>LAN Shang shouted.</p><p>“Then open it and take a look!”</p><p>Commander Wang said.</p><p>LAN Shang’s gaze swept over the heads of the Jin, winged man, and Qin families. He discovered that the three of them were only staring at him with bright eyes and did not reveal any timidity or uneasiness.</p><p>LAN Shang frowned. A thought flashed through his mind. Perhaps the spy really wasn’t from one of these three families.</p><p>However, at this point, the projection could only be made public.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>LAN Shang nodded. He then formed a seal and the axe shone. The projection of Lu Ming that he had seen previously appeared again.</p><p>Everyone watched without blinking. Soon, the contents of the projection were finished.</p><p>it really was someone from the Qin heaven Starfield who stole the nine absolute God crystal!</p><p>“And there really is an inside man!”</p><p>but those spies were wrapped in black robes, so their appearances couldn’t be seen clearly. Also, from their words, they didn’t reveal which force they were from!</p><p>however, I finally found the nine absolute God crystal!</p><p>After seeing the projection, the scene fell into a clamor as everyone discussed.</p><p>“Hehehe, this is your evidence? Although he had found the location of the nine absolute God crystal, who was the spy? I don’t know at all!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family sneered.</p><p>that’s right. This brat even dares to slander our three great aristocratic families. He’s extremely audacious!</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan shouted coldly, his aura icy.</p><p>kid, let me tell you. I want to kill you because you killed the heaven’s favorites of the Jin family. Today, you have to pay with your life!</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted coldly and took a step forward. His violent aura soared to the sky, and his killing intent was as cold as a knife.</p><p>Now, he finally didn’t have to worry and could make a move.</p><p>“That’s right, you killed my son, so you have to pay with your life!”</p><p>The winged man clan’s clan head flapped his wings, and Thunder rumbled like a god of Thunder.</p><p>&Nbsp; the Qin family head flashed and locked his aura onto the Wu family head to prevent him from interfering.</p><p>what a joke. The Jin family has targeted me and tried to kill me time and time again. Can’t I fight back and kill them? ”</p><p>and Yi Xiang. He attacked my wife in the ancient star area city. He almost killed her. Can’t I take revenge? ”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily. He was not afraid of the family heads at all.</p><p>“I don’t care what reason you have. You killed a member of my Jin family, so you must die!”</p><p>The master of the Jin family bellowed in a domineering manner. His entire body was covered in a dazzling golden light. He stretched out one of his hands, forming a Golden Palm that grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The palm was huge and covered the void, bringing with it a terrifying aura.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that he could not move his body at all. It was as if his body had been sealed. He could not even blink.</p><p>In the face of a peak Divine King, Lu Ming was simply too weak. He was like an ant.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the Wu family head shouted and wanted to help, but the Qin family head’s aura exploded and locked onto the Wu family head.</p><p>&Nbsp; as long as the Wu family head made a move, the Qin family head would also strike like lightning.</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch simply couldn’t make a move.</p><p>“That kid called Lu Ming is dead for sure!”</p><p>it’s a pity that a heaven’s favorite has provoked the heads of the three great families. There’s no hope!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>On the side, commander Wang and the other Heavenly King divine guards ‘eyes flashed, but they had no intention of interfering.</p><p>The Golden Palm was about to grab Lu Ming. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, he would be dead if he was caught. The gap between them was too great.</p><p>However, at this moment, a sword light flashed past and slashed at the Golden Palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword radiance struck the Golden Palm and exploded with a violent boom. Then, the sword radiance and the Golden Palm both collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>The Jin family’s head’s eyes narrowed, and then fell on LAN Shang.</p><p>Just now, it was LAN Shang who had made a move.</p><p>“You want to kill him? have you asked me?”</p><p>LAN Shang spoke indifferently. He slowly stepped forward and landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body immediately relaxed. The pressure that the Jin family’s master gave him disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and realized that he was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Facing a figure like the master of the Jin family, he was under too much pressure. The key was that he couldn’t resist at all. He wanted to but he couldn’t.</p><p>“LAN Shang, you want to interfere?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said coldly.</p><p>of course, he’s my son-in-law. Do you think I’ll just watch him get killed? ”</p><p>LAN Shang said indifferently.</p><p>“Hehe, what can you do if you don’t watch? Do you still think you’re the blue merchant from back then? The teacher of rebellious Jing Yu? That’s all in the past!”</p><p>“That year, your star core was destroyed. What did you use to stop me?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family sneered with a touch of disdain.</p><p>“What? The star core has been destroyed!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was the first time he had heard of it.</p><p>It turned out that LAN Shang’s star core had been destroyed.</p><p>After breaking through to the God King realm, one’s divine flame would condense into a star core. A star core was the core of a cultivator. If a star core was destroyed, it would be equivalent to a cultivator’s cultivation being destroyed.</p><p>It was no wonder that LAN Shang, Jing Yu’s teacher, was not sealed or anything else. Instead, he was free.</p><p>What kind of storm could a person whose star core had been destroyed cause?</p><p>“To deal with people like you, even if your star core is destroyed, it’s enough!”</p><p>LAN Shang smiled faintly, appearing very confident.</p><p>arrogant. Then let’s see what you, the man who was called the ‘Emperor’s teacher’, can do.</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted coldly. He took a step forward, and his aura exploded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
