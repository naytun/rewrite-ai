They were bathed in blood and fought madly. Both of them were severely injured, but their eyes were filled with unyielding conviction and fighting spirit.</p><p>Right now, they only had one goal, and that was to kill each other.</p><p>The loser would die!</p><p>The winner might be able to achieve a transformation!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them once again clashed. Si Ji slashed out blade lights that clashed with Xu Yan’s fist energy.</p><p>The fighting ring shook, and the energy was overflowing.</p><p>Right at this moment, Xu Yan’s body trembled as if he was unable to block the attack, and the power behind his fist collapsed. Si Ji’s eyes lit up as he raised his saber and attacked.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Si Ji’s saber slashed down on Xu Yan’s body, causing the stone armor on Xu Yan’s body to split apart. The saber Qi also penetrated his bones.</p><p>But in the end, it was still defended by Xu Yan.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>At that moment, si Ji’s expression changed. He realized that something was wrong, but it was too late.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xu Yan suddenly exploded forth with a terrifying punch, and the power of his fist blasted out and landed on si Ji’s body.</p><p>Si Ji’s body was directly pierced through, and a large hole appeared in his body.</p><p>Si Ji spat out a large mouthful of blood as his body was sent flying. He crashed onto the fighting stage and could not move.</p><p>Xu Yan also spat out a mouthful of blood. However, his injuries were much lighter than si Ji’s.</p><p>Just now, he had intentionally revealed a flaw to allow si Ji to slash him. This was also because he had done this. Ordinary people would not dare to do this, as Xu Yan’s defense was extremely powerful. In the end, he had paid the price of being heavily injured to completely defeat si Ji.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Xu Yan dragged his bloodied body as he walked towards si Ji. With each step, he left a footprint on the ground.</p><p>“Hahaha, this is great, this is great, this is a great battle …”</p><p>At that moment, si Ji suddenly laughed out loud and struggled to get up. He looked at Xu Yan and said, this battle was enjoyable. Unfortunately, I lost. If I lose, I’ll die. Come, give me a quick death!</p><p>“You’re an opponent worthy of respect. Rest in peace!”</p><p>As Xu Yan spoke, his aura exploded out, and a mountain-like fist energy shot towards si Ji.</p><p>As the fist energy crushed over, si Ji’s body completely collapsed and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Si Ji had fallen!</p><p>Not everyone was afraid of death. Ever since si Ji had stepped onto the fighting stage, he had already prepared himself to be killed.</p><p>“Have a safe trip!”</p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself. He then retracted his aura. He couldn’t take it anymore and sat on the ground. He took out a bullet and swallowed it.</p><p>Although Xu Yan was severely injured in this battle, Lu Ming had a feeling that Xu Yan might be able to break through to the divine King stage very soon after this battle.</p><p>Si Ji’s small path disappeared, and the fighting stage disappeared as well. Xu Yan was sitting cross-legged on his own path.</p><p>The first round had ended. Of the ten geniuses, only five remained.</p><p>Of the other five, two were killed and three had admitted defeat!</p><p>the five of you will also be fighting randomly!</p><p>The formation spirit looked at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“I, forfeit!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan spoke.</p><p>He was heavily injured and had no strength to fight anymore.</p><p>Furthermore, he had gained enough from the battle just now. There was no need for him to continue fighting.</p><p>alright, I’ll allow you to forfeit. There are only four people left!</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>The remaining four people were Lu Ming, Chu baxing, you han, and a prodigy from the abysmal Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>The four people’s eyes met, and sparks flew.</p><p>Especially Chu BA Xing and you han, who were filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>In Chu BA Xing’s eyes, his greatest opponent was you han.</p><p>Previously, he had been completely suppressed by you han outside the castle. However, he still had a trump card that he had not used. Otherwise, he might have been able to fight you han. It was hard to say who would have survived.</p><p>At this time, the formation spirit waved its hand, and two of the roads quickly extended and converged together, forming a fighting stage.</p><p>Lu Ming, Chu baxing!</p><p>These two paths were Lu Ming and Chu baxing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Chu baxing stepped out and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>hahaha, kid, I’ve finally met you. Come on, if you have the guts, come up and fight me!</p><p>Chu BA Xing laughed.</p><p>“You’re not surrendering?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Surrender? Hahaha, what a joke, don’t use such a stupid method to scare me, I’m not scared!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing laughed.</p><p>He had always thought that Jin Yuan had surrendered on purpose. He had colluded with Lu Ming to scare them.</p><p>Moreover, even if Lu Ming had some abilities, what did he have to fear?</p><p>The others looked at Lu Ming with curiosity. They were curious about how Lu Ming would get off the stage in such a situation.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming was digging his own grave.</p><p>If he fought, he would lose his life when facing Chu baxing. If he didn’t, he would become a joke.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. In a flash, he appeared on the fighting ring.</p><p>“He actually accepted the challenge!”</p><p>You Han, Xu Yan, and the others were stunned.</p><p>Obviously, this was beyond their expectations. They did not expect that Lu Ming would really dare to accept the challenge.</p><p>In their opinion, Lu Ming could not scare Chu baxing and would most likely admit defeat.</p><p>“This kid, could he really have the strength?”</p><p>The same thought flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>Only Jin Yuan’s eyes glinted coldly. This was exactly what he wanted. No matter who lost in the life-and-death battle between Lu Ming and Chu baxing, he would be happy.</p><p>Of course, he still hoped that Lu Ming would be killed because Lu Ming had killed a genius of the Jin family.</p><p>“You have some guts!”</p><p>Chu baxing narrowed his eyes. Clearly, Lu Ming accepting the challenge was out of his expectations. He had thought that Lu Ming would admit defeat.</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped onto the fighting ring, a light shield rose around the fighting ring and covered it.</p><p>“Let’s start!”</p><p>The formation spirit announced.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as the formation spirit finished speaking, Chu baxing made his move. His armor glowed with a dazzling radiance, and a Spear’s gleam burst forth, piercing towards Lu Ming with incomparable sharpness.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated his quadruple combat power and used the air-piercing move. He also stabbed with his spear. A ray of spear light collided with Chu baxing’s attack. It was as if two meteors had collided, erupting with a sudden wave of energy.</p><p>you also use a spear. Let me see what you’re capable of. Fifteen ton strike!</p><p>Chu baxing stepped out with a mountain-like aura. His divine power erupted like a volcano, soaring into the sky. His aura was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He struck out with his spear. A huge spear light covered the fighting ring and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This move was several times stronger than the previous one. If the other geniuses hadn’t awakened the origin divine power factor, even half-step divine kings would have been killed by this move.</p><p>Many people stared at Lu Ming, wanting to see how he would defend against this move with his fifth-level celestial deity cultivation.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With a roar, Lu Ming’s body expanded rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he had turned into a green-armored ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>Then, he swept his long spear out. It was also incomparably huge, and it collided with Chu baxing’s spear radiance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
