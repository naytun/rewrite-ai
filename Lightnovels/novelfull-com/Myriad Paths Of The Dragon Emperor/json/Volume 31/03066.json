This girl received the inheritance of the divine eye heavenly Lord. With the help of the nine-orifice Saint heart, it’s natural for her to improve quickly.</p><p>The rock spirit explained.</p><p>that’s right. Moreover, the energy I absorbed before was only a portion. It’s equivalent to you drinking a mouthful of soup while the meat was eaten by that girl. It’s normal for her to improve so quickly!</p><p>The quantity formula also explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had only taken a sip of the ‘soup’ and his cultivation had risen from the fifth-level to the sixth-level celestial deity.</p><p>Qiu Yue had completely inherited the divine eye heavenly Lord’s inheritance, so her cultivation would naturally soar.</p><p>Of course, it was only at the beginning. It was impossible for it to continue rising like this.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation was not over yet. In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>The aura on Qiu Yue’s body exploded again.</p><p>He broke through, and he broke through again.</p><p>Ninth level celestial deity!</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation had reached the ninth level celestial deity.</p><p>Moreover, an ancient aura emanated from Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>Origin divine power factor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Qiu Yue had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>However, like Lu Ming, only the divine power of a God had awakened the origin divine power factor. The other divine powers had not awakened yet.</p><p>At this point, Qiu Yue’s aura finally stabilized and did not continue to rise.</p><p>A few more days passed, and Qiu Yue’s breathing stabilized. She opened her eyes.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue let out a soft cry and pounced into Lu Ming’s arms.</p><p>Qiu Yue could sense everything that had happened.</p><p>She had thought that she would never see Lu Ming and would be possessed by the divine eye Lord. She did not expect that Lu Ming would come and kill the divine eye Lord in one blow.</p><p>As she had been in a deadlock with the divine eye heavenly Lord for many years, she had a reaction. Once the soul of the divine eye heavenly Lord was destroyed, she automatically absorbed the inheritance left behind by the divine eye heavenly Lord.</p><p>“Qiuyue, it’s fine now. Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming caressed Qiu Yue’s hair. The two of them had a moment of intimacy before they left the place hand in hand.</p><p>Along the way, they would occasionally encounter those eyeball monsters but they were easily dealt with by Lu Ming and Qiu Yue.</p><p>As Qiu Yue’s cultivation had increased too much, she was still not used to it. She was not very familiar with the control of the divine power in her body and needed time to Polish it.</p><p>He believed that once Qiu Yue had completely adapted to her current cultivation, her strength would be shockingly strong.</p><p>One should know that Qiu Yue also controlled many types of divine power. In addition, she had awakened the origin divine power factor and her cultivation was at the ninth-tier heavenly God Realm. Once she got used to it, Lu Ming might not be Qiu Yue’s match even if he used all his strength.</p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived at the outermost stone room.</p><p>Above his head, there was a rumbling sound. It was the sound of the whirlpool in the thousand Moon Lake. When he looked up, he could still see the whirlpool. It was very wonderful.</p><p>“Let’s charge out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded, and the two of them rose into the air and rushed into the vortex.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The vortex spun with great force, forming a shocking force that blocked the two’s path.</p><p>If the two of them wanted to go against the current, it would definitely not be that easy.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and transformed into his ancient God Body. He used all his strength and thrust his spear.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The lake water exploded, forming a passage. The two of them took the opportunity to fly forward.</p><p>However, the lake water quickly surged over and blocked the passage.</p><p>“God-destroying light!”</p><p>die! Qiu Yue shouted and struck out with her palm. A Dark Divine light was shot towards the vortex in front of her.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up in surprise. He did not expect Qiu Yue to master the divine eye Lord’s God-destroying light so quickly.</p><p>The God-destroying light was extremely powerful. Even though Qiu Yue had just mastered it, she could still exert a shocking power. The vortex was immediately cut open by the God-destroying light.</p><p>The two of them continued forward.</p><p>Just like that, the two of them joined hands and took turns to attack. Soon, they passed through the whirlpool and flew out of it, arriving above the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The two of them let out a breath of turbid air. They were finally out.</p><p>This trip could be considered to be more dangerous than dangerous, and her cultivation had even broken through. Especially Qiu Yue, who had obtained the inheritance of a heavenly Lord.</p><p>Qiuyue, you have obtained the inheritance of the divine eye heavenly Lord. Don’t let anyone know about this!</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>The inheritance of a heavenly Lord was definitely an unimaginable opportunity. If it was known to others, it would definitely cause a great disaster, just like the origin ancient word.</p><p>“Understood, young master!”</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled.</p><p>“By the way, Qiu Yue, how did you get into the whirlpool?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“I was forced to go in!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“You were forced to go in? Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p>a winged man, a lightning winged man!</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Lightning winged human race!”</p><p>Lu Ming recalled the youth from the lightning winged human race whom he had met when he first arrived at the thousand Moon Lake. It was the youth who had guided Lu Ming into the whirlpool.</p><p>Lu Ming then described the appearance of the young man from the winged men tribe that he had met.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s him!”</p><p>Qiu Yue said.</p><p>“Why did he force you into the vortex?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>he said that someone hired him to deal with you, young master. Since I’m your man, he’s going to take me down to threaten you!</p><p>‘He even said that I must have a secret since I’m able to pass through the gate of heaven at the second level of celestial deity realm. He wants to obtain the secret on me, and if I don’t tell him, he’ll … I’m about to …”</p><p>At this point, Qiu Yue bit her red lips and did not continue. However, Lu Ming could guess what Qiu Yue was going to say.</p><p>Lu Ming held Qiu Yue’s small hand and let her continue.</p><p>of course, I wouldn’t let him succeed, but I was no match for him. I couldn’t escape, so I had no choice but to risk entering the vortex. I didn’t expect that there was another world in the vortex. After entering, I met the divine eye heavenly Lord and he wanted to take over my body. I’ve been trying my best to fight him, and then young master came!</p><p>Qiu Yue briefly explained her experiences over the years.</p><p>“Lightning winged human race!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed with a cold killing intent.</p><p>He had completely understood.</p><p>That lightning winged human was most likely invited by the Jin or Qin clan to kill Lu Ming in star-moon ancient city.</p><p>After entering star-moon ancient city, the winged man met Qiu Yue near the thousand Moon Lake. He wanted to take Qiu Yue down and threaten Lu Ming. He wanted to get Qiu Yue’s Secret and even plot against her.</p><p>Qiu Yue had no choice but to rush into the whirlpool to avoid the other party.</p><p>The other party definitely didn’t dare to enter the whirlpool, so he had been cultivating nearby. After Qiu Yue didn’t come out for many years, he most likely thought that there was danger in the whirlpool and that Qiu Yue had died inside.</p><p>Later on, when Lu Ming came, the other party harbored ill intentions and tricked Lu Ming into entering, hoping that he would die in the vortex.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
