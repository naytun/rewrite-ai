They had no problem crossing the starry sky.</p><p>“Enemy attack, enemy attack!”</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>As soon as they appeared, they were discovered by the dark ice Race.</p><p>Suddenly, runes appeared on the snow-white planets. These runes interwove once more and formed a huge array.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, endless sword light rushed out from those planets.</p><p>.com</p><p>Each combat sword was extremely huge and made of ice. They were thousands of miles long and had amazing power.</p><p>Hmph, you want to stop us with just a formation? die!</p><p>break! the patriarch of the Scarlet Flame clan shouted coldly. His entire body was as dazzling as the sun. He struck out with his palm, and more than ten ice swords shattered.</p><p>At the same time, the sect master of the indestructible sword sect and the others also made their moves. Sword light shot into the sky, destroying those icy combat swords.</p><p>They naturally had to take action now to lower Lu Ming’s guard.</p><p>However, they did not use their full strength.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The ice swords formed by the dark ice clan’s great formation continued to shatter.</p><p>Facing so many powerhouses from the Qin heaven Starfield, even if the dark ice Clan set up a great formation, it would not be enough.</p><p>Soon, everyone rushed into the Galaxy.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The Qin heaven thirteen clans, the Scarlet Flame race, and the ice Soul Race had a large number of godkings. With so many godkings attacking together, the power was earth-shattering.</p><p>Beams of divine light blasted toward the planets.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Those planets seemed to have an earthquake of dozens of magnitude. Every beam of divine light could blow up a large piece of the planet.</p><p>The mountains collapsed and the earth cracked. It was a true landslide.</p><p>If a Godking were to go all out, they would truly have the power to destroy a planet, much less so many godkings.</p><p>It was simply destructive.</p><p>The earth crumbled and the entire planet exploded. The formation engraved on the planet was naturally broken.</p><p>On those planets, there were constant screams.</p><p>They were all from the dark ice Clan.</p><p>The dark ice Race members ‘bodies all exploded under the attacks of the God kings, and their bodies and souls were destroyed.</p><p>the dark ice Race dared to steal the precious treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. They must be destroyed!</p><p>“Kill without mercy!”</p><p>A series of cold voices rang out as everyone broke through the barriers. The outermost planets of the Galaxy were quickly broken through.</p><p>Everyone charged into the depths of the Galaxy.</p><p>At the place closest to the star, there was a planet that was the largest. It was the core of the dark ice Race.</p><p>With unstoppable momentum, they soon broke through all the planets on the periphery and directly killed their way to the planet in the core.</p><p>“That’s the dark ice clan’s core base. Kill!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan pointed at a vast Glacier and shouted.</p><p>In front of them was a vast expanse of glaciers. Looking up, there were many glaciers that were hundreds of thousands of feet tall everywhere, covering a vast area.</p><p>This place was the true core area of the dark ice Clan. Many experts of the dark ice Clan lived here.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan led a large number of experts to attack the glacier.</p><p>Lu Ming and the experts from Kong Xuan sect also charged in.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, powerful auras burst out from the glacier. Some of them had even reached the divine King realm.</p><p>The dark ice clan’s Hotshots had all come out.</p><p>“B * stard of the ice Soul Clan! Kill!”</p><p>“We’ll fight to the death!”</p><p>The dark ice clan’s Warriors roared angrily. They knew they couldn’t escape today. They had to fight to the death.</p><p>Figures rushed out of the endless glaciers and fought fiercely with the Masters of the ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>At this moment, the people from the red flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, the unique demon Academy, and other forces had slowed down and even stopped behind.</p><p>“Let them kill each other first. It’s best if both sides suffer heavy losses!”</p><p>“Let’s get ready!”</p><p>The sect master of the immortal sword sect, the Dean of the winged demon Academy, and the others conversed in secret. Killing intent flashed in their eyes. Finally, they stopped in the distance and made arrangements secretly.</p><p>“These guys are really unreliable!”</p><p>The ice Soul Clan had also noticed their actions, but they were busy fighting the dark ice Clan and could not care less.</p><p>“There’s indeed something fishy!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the void with a cold smile on his face.</p><p>He had naturally seen the actions of the immortal sword sect and the other forces.</p><p>“If these people are looking for death, I don’t mind swallowing them!”</p><p>A burly man in a black robe beside Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>This black-robed man was naturally Bone Devil in human form.</p><p>“No, unless it’s the last resort, don’t make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Bone demon was his trump card, and he wouldn’t use it unless he had no choice.</p><p>Both sides continued to fight, but Lu Ming’s side had the upper hand.</p><p>Even if it was only the ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect, their strength was still far above the dark ice Clan.</p><p>Before, they were worried about the killing formation set up by the other party. Now that the killing formation was broken, the dark ice Race was no match for them with their true strength.</p><p>In particular, there was an elder from the ice Soul Clan who was extremely powerful. No one was his match wherever he went and he had already killed six divine kings.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell that the elder was at the fourth level of the divine King realm. He must be the patriarch of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The dark ice Race didn’t have any fourth level Divine King realm experts. The highest level they had was the third level Divine King realm.</p><p>A third level Divine King realm expert from the dark ice Race was locked in a fierce battle with the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>However, no one could defeat the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>He was invincible, and with a flash of his body, he could kill an expert on the other side. With the help of the other experts, the scene was one-sided.</p><p>Before long, more than half of the ice Soul clan’s experts were killed.</p><p>an Yin, how dare you steal the treasures of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. How dare you! Hand over the nine absolute God crystal!</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan shouted coldly.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. If you want it, come and get it yourself!”</p><p>The dark ice clan’s patriarch sneered.</p><p>“Since you want to die, this old man will fulfill your wish!”</p><p>A cold voice was heard as the ice Soul race’s patriarch charged toward Chang an Yin of the dark ice Race.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch slammed his palm down. Endless cold waves turned into a terrifying palm force that headed toward an Yin.</p><p>An Yin’s expression changed drastically. He also struck out with his palm with all his might. However, the strength of a fourth level Godking was not something a third level Godking could withstand.</p><p>An Yin’s body was sent flying with a boom. Even though he cultivated ice-based divine power, a layer of ice appeared on his body and he was almost frozen.</p><p>He spat out a large mouthful of blood, but the blood turned into ice crystals as soon as it came out.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch pounced toward an Yin like a violent Lion.</p><p>“Senior, spare his life!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in time.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch reduced the force of his palm, but an Yin was still sent flying. A layer of ice covered an Yin completely, making it difficult for him to move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
