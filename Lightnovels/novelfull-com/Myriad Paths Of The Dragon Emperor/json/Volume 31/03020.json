His divine power had awakened to ninety-nine percent, and its power was astonishing. Not only was it extremely condensed, but it also had a trace of the characteristics of origin divine power, which was full of destructive power.</p><p>Using this divine power to display the seven injury fist was not something the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorites from before could compare to.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming activated the divine energy in his body to the extreme. With the seven types of divine-grade divine energy as the core, he condensed them into a ball and struck out along with the power of the long spear.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The second collision between the two of them was even more terrifying. The stone platform under their feet shook violently.</p><p>This time, the two of them were still equally matched, and it was difficult to determine who was better.</p><p>The people in the audience were really shocked, especially Jin Xing.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was stronger than him when they fought in the Qin heaven Galaxy, there was a limit. It had only been a short while and Lu Ming’s strength had already reached such a level.</p><p>This level of strength could completely kill him in seconds.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>Qin Wukong let out a long howl and continuously punched out with both his fists. One after another, fist seals emerged from his body and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sky-breaking, moon-cutting …”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to cast the first two moves of the three apocalyptic strikes as he fought with Qin Wukong.</p><p>The two of them fought intensely and continuously. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves, but it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Satisfying!”</p><p>The more Lu Ming fought, the more excited he became. His fighting spirit grew stronger and stronger. He was more and more used to the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>His divine power was endless. He was not afraid of using up his divine power. Every move he made could push the power to the extreme.</p><p>As for Qin Wukong, the more he fought, the more shocked he became.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a fifth-level celestial deity. With his cultivation base, he originally thought that he could easily take him down. However, Lu Ming’s combat strength far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Up until now, he had not managed to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>“It seems that I have to go all out!”</p><p>Qin Wukong’s eyes flashed. Then, his body suddenly retreated. In the process of his retreat, a ray of green light suddenly appeared on his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Wukong’s figure disappeared. On the stone platform, a series of afterimages appeared.</p><p>This was a terrifying speed-type divine skill. When it was used, the sky was filled with afterimages, and the speed was astonishing.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current eyesight, it was difficult for an average speed to leave an afterimage in his eyes.</p><p>To be able to leave an afterimage in front of his eyes, one could see how fast the speed was. It was faster than Lu Ming’s eyesight.</p><p>speed-type divine skill, level eight!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He could tell that Qin Wukong was using a speed-type divine skill. However, it had already reached the eighth level.</p><p>For those below the God King level, being able to cultivate a God technique to the eighth level was already extremely impressive.</p><p>For example, the Qin clan’s prodigy and Jin Jue had only cultivated their divine skills to the seventh level.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>Qin Wukong’s voice rang out again. Then, from all directions, fist prints blasted toward Lu Ming and completely enveloped him.</p><p>The combination of a speed-type divine skill and the seven injury divine fist sealed off all escape routes, and its power increased even more.</p><p>In an instant, dozens of fist prints were blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only one who has the eighth level of a speed-type divine skill?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. Divine energy surged on his body and condensed into a ninth heaven Kunpeng.</p><p>This ninth heaven Kunpeng was very small and was only slightly bigger than Lu Ming. With a flap of its wings, Lu Ming disappeared from where he was.</p><p>In the eyes of the others, Lu Ming had also turned into a series of afterimages as he shuttled through the many fist imprints. His speed was so fast that he was not slower than Qin Wukong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s nine heavenly kun Peng technique had also been cultivated to the eighth stage.</p><p>The nine heavenly kun Peng technique was known for its long distance flight and extremely fast speed.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming had used it to move within a short distance. It was extremely powerful and he had completely dodged Qin Wukong’s fist.</p><p>this kid’s speed-type divine skill has also been cultivated to the eighth level. Damn it!</p><p>Qin Wukong roared in his heart. He was truly shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His figure came to a sudden stop. He retracted his fist force, gathered it, and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Qin Wukong opened his mouth and let out a long howl. From his mouth, a terrifying vibration was emitted.</p><p>The air above Qin Wukong’s mouth began to vibrate at a visible rate. In the end, it actually turned into many combat swords and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear to block it. When the combat sword hit the long spear, the long spear trembled continuously and buzzed. Lu Ming’s body trembled slightly and he took a few steps back.</p><p>what a powerful divine skill! It’s the eighth level of an attack-type divine skill!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>Qin Wukong was indeed powerful. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>Not only had he cultivated a speed-type divine skill to the eighth level, but he had also cultivated an attack-type divine skill to the eighth level.</p><p>The power of the eighth level of the offensive divine skill had already surpassed the seven injury divine fist.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Qin Wukong roared. He opened his mouth and howled. The air trembled and formed more combat swords that slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>nine-clawed Divine Dragon! Lu Ming shouted and stepped forward. Seven nine-clawed divine Dragons formed and pounced at Qin Wukong, clashing with his sword.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The rumbling sounds continued. The nine-clawed Divine Dragon was no match for it. It trembled violently and was finally split in half.</p><p>However, Lu Ming cast the ice chain again.</p><p>The nine ice chains danced around like long snakes. When Qin Wukong’s combat sword struck the ice chains, a clanging sound could be heard. However, it did not break the ice chains and was instead blocked by them.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Qin Wukong was shocked.</p><p>His offensive divine skill was known for its offensive power. He had cultivated it to the eighth level and with the support of his 99% awakened divine power, its power was shocking and its destructive power was extremely strong. However, Lu Ming had actually blocked it.</p><p>“Break the sky!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the opportunity to launch an attack. A ray of spear light burst out and pierced toward Qin Wukong.</p><p>Qin Wukong was shocked. He wanted to Dodge, but it was already too late. He could only barely avoid his vital parts. The spear radiance swept across his body. Half of his body was almost blown apart. Blood and flesh flew everywhere. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I want you to die!”</p><p>Qin Wukong’s eyes were bloodshot. His body emitted even more terrifying waves of energy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Qin Wukong threw out two consecutive punches. The two fist prints converged into one, emitting a piercing blood-red color. It crushed toward Lu Ming with a frightening power.</p><p>its power has increased by a level. It’s said that the Qin family’s seven injury divine fist gets stronger the more injured you are. It’s true!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing.</p><p>He had injured Qin Wukong just now, but it had instead allowed Qin Wukong to activate the power of the seven injury divine fist to its maximum.</p><p>“Let’s see how long you can last!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He did not believe that if he beat the other party until he was half-dead, the other party would still be able to erupt with combat strength.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The nine ice chains danced around him, forming a defensive wall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
