Otherwise, I’ll make a move!</p><p>The saber-wielding youth sneered.</p><p>don’t even think about it. Even if we die, we won’t fall into your hands!</p><p>Wu zixiong roared in anger, his face was filled with determination.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>At this moment, the two wild beasts that were pulling the carriage roared and gave off a powerful killing intent.</p><p>“Stop talking nonsense, the Li beast is hungry!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice came from the chariot.</p><p>On both sides of the chariot, the four young men and women’s faces changed drastically when they heard the sound.</p><p>“Young master, please wait a moment. I’ll feed the Li beast now!”</p><p>The young man with the saber nodded and bowed respectfully before walking to the back of the chariot.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t!”</p><p>“I beg you, please spare me!”</p><p>Behind the war chariots, the young heaven’s chosen who were shackled began to scream in terror. Some howled, others begged for mercy.</p><p>“Noisy, you two are the loudest. So annoying, it’s just you two!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man stretched out his hand. A force of attraction burst out and formed a huge hand, grabbing the two people.</p><p>spare me, spare me!</p><p>“No, I don’t want to …”</p><p>The two young men screamed and struggled madly.</p><p>However, these young men seemed to be severely injured and couldn’t break free at all.</p><p>The saber-hugging young man grabbed the two young men and returned to the front of the chariot. With a wave of his hand, the two young men flew out.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>The two wild beasts roared and opened their bloody mouths. One by one, they swallowed the two young men and began to chew.</p><p>Two shrill screams came out of the two wild beasts ‘mouths, and then there was no sound. Then, blood flowed out from the corners of the wild beasts’ mouths. The scene was terrifying.</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others all had ugly expressions.</p><p>The remaining young men behind the chariot were all filled with despair.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body suddenly burst out with a cold aura that was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>He finally knew why the back of the chariot was chained to those young men. It turned out that these young men were food for the two desolate beasts that were pulling the chariot.</p><p>Using a heaven’s favorite to feed his own desolate beast, cruel, extremely cruel.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s temperament, he could not help but reveal a strong killing intent.</p><p>“Yo, your killing intent is so strong. A fifth level celestial deity overestimates his own ability!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man sneered at Lu Ming, his eyes filled with disdain.</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense, take them down, and then go find more food for my li beast, don’t waste time!”</p><p>At this moment, the cold voice came out from the chariot again.</p><p>yes, young master. I’ll take them down immediately!</p><p>The saber-hugging young man’s expression changed. He quickly bowed and saluted, then looked at Lu Ming and the rest with a cold gaze.</p><p>go, go quickly, spread out and escape. If you can’t escape, then self-destruct. We can’t fall into their hands!</p><p>Wu zixiong roared.</p><p>They would rather self-destruct and be crushed into pieces than fall into the hands of the saber-hugging young man.</p><p>If they fell into the other party’s hands, their outcome would be extremely miserable, they would become food for desolate beasts.</p><p>you want to leave? dream on! Heavenly blade cage!</p><p>you’re courting death! the saber-wielding young man shouted coldly. His aura burst out and beams of dazzling light condensed out of thin air. They were extremely huge and each of them was ten thousand meters long. They spread out in all directions and enveloped Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The expressions of Wu Ming and the others changed drastically. Their escape route had been blocked, and even if they wanted to escape, they could not.</p><p>“Self-destruct!”</p><p>Wu Ming sighed. Then, a powerful fluctuation spread out from his body. He was going to self-destruct.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a palm pressed down on Wu Ming’s body, suppressing all of his boiling divine power.</p><p>“Why did you self-destruct? Just kill these scumbags and everything will be fine!”</p><p>A faint voice was heard. The person who spoke was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Wu zixiong, Wu Ming and the rest were all stunned.</p><p>Kill him?</p><p>The young man with the saber had fought before. He was a half-step Divine King and his divine power was not low. His combat strength was especially strong. Even Wu zixiong at his peak was not his opponent.</p><p>The other three young men had not made a move yet, but their strength must not be low.</p><p>The existence on the chariot was even more unfathomable. How could they kill the other party?</p><p>It was like throwing an egg at a rock.</p><p>“Hahaha, what did I just hear? A fifth level heavenly deity said that he wanted to kill us, did I hear wrongly?”</p><p>The young man holding the saber laughed out loud.</p><p>“You didn’t hear wrong, he did say that!”</p><p>The other young man also spoke, his face also revealing a disdainful smile.</p><p>this kid is really stupid. Is the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion full of such people? ”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man looked at Lu Ming and sneered, ” “Brat, seeing that you’re so stupid, I’ll be the first to send you to the Li beasts as food!”</p><p>With that, the saber-wielding young man took a step forward and reached out his hand to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>A huge hand formed and grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, get out of the way!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others were shocked.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently and took a step forward as well.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As Lu Ming took a step forward, a Dragon’s Roar was heard. Then, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon was formed and pounced at the saber-wielding young man’s big hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine-clawed Divine Dragon Dharma idol’s Dragon Claw stepped out continuously and tore with all its might, directly tearing apart the giant hand that the other party had condensed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This scene was not only out of the saber-hugging young man’s expectations, but even Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others were stunned.</p><p>Lu Ming could actually withstand the other party’s attack?</p><p>The saber-hugging young man was stunned for a moment, then his eyes revealed a strong killing intent.</p><p>kid, so you have some strength. No wonder you’re so confident. However, this bit of strength is nothing in my hands. I’ll show you my true strength!</p><p>kill! the saber-hugging youth shouted. At the same time, a violent aura burst out.</p><p>The move just now was just a casual attack by the saber-hugging young man. He had thought that it would be a piece of cake to deal with a fifth-level celestial deity. He did not expect that Lu Ming’s abilities would exceed his imagination.</p><p>Now, he was serious.</p><p>“Heavenly blade art, slash!”</p><p>The saber-hugging youth shouted. A terrifying saber-light burst out and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons appeared and pounced on the other party.</p><p>The nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons continuously pounced on the saber radiance. The saber radiance trembled continuously and finally shattered with a bang.</p><p>“Kid, you …”</p><p>The saber-hugging teenager was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the nine divine Dragons had already pounced on him.</p><p>“Heavenly blade art, slash the world!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man roared. The saber-light soared into the sky, and his aura became even stronger.</p><p>At this moment, he used all his strength and didn’t dare to hide anything.</p><p>This person’s strength was indeed very strong. When he used his full strength, he was even stronger than Wu zixiong.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>More than ten saber lights slashed at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
