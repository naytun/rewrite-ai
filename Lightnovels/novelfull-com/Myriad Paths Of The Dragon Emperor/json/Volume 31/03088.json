This is a great contribution. It can’t be offset by the lives of a few insignificant people. I think that not only is Lu Ming not guilty, but he should also be heavily rewarded!</p><p>“What? What did you just say?”</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>The Jin clan’s clan head, the winged man clan’s clan head, and a few others roared in anger. They glared at the Wu clan’s clan head as if their eyes were about to spew fire.</p><p>One of the people that Lu Ming had killed was the son of the winged man family’s master. The other one was one of the four heroes of the Jin family.</p><p>These people had become insignificant passersby in the Wu family’s patriarch’s words.</p><p>Preposterous!</p><p>Commander Wang frowned.</p><p>.com</p><p>The head of the Wu family was right. Finding the whereabouts of the nine absolute divine crystal was indeed a great contribution and should be rewarded.</p><p>that’s a separate matter. He did find the location of the nine absolute God crystal, which is indeed a contribution. However, that doesn’t mean that he can be lawless and kill innocent people!</p><p>The master of the Jin family shouted, ” if we want to talk about merits, who here doesn’t have any merits for the Heavenly King Manor? but do you think you can be lawless just because you have merits? ” Therefore, this is a separate matter. The punishment should still be the punishment!”</p><p>that’s right, a life for a life. This brat must die!</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan also roared.</p><p>what a joke. Rewards and punishments should be clearly defined. Do you think the people from your families are more important than the nine absolute God crystal? I think it’s enough to make up for your mistakes. You even need to reward them!</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch said.</p><p>Commander Wang’s brows furrowed even more.</p><p>He was in a difficult position.</p><p>If it was an ordinary person’s matter, he could easily solve it.</p><p>But now, on one side, there were the heads of the Jin family and the winged man family. On the other side, there was the head of the Wu family and LAN Shang, whose strength was unfathomable.</p><p>He was in a difficult position.</p><p>No matter what the verdict was, it would offend one party.</p><p>“I can only try to balance it!”</p><p>Commander Wang muttered in his heart, then shouted, ” “Lu Ming killed people without reason. It’s a serious crime and he should be sentenced to death. However, on the account that he found the whereabouts of the nine absolute divine crystal, his merits and faults will offset each other!”</p><p>Lu Ming had a cold smile on his face.</p><p>Commander Wang’s actions showed that he didn’t offend either side, but in fact, he was still biased towards the master of the Jin family.</p><p>Logically speaking, he had found the location of the nine absolute God crystal, which was a great contribution.</p><p>The nine absolute God crystal was a precious treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. Its value was shocking. The Wu family’s head was right. The nine absolute God crystal was far more valuable than Yi Xiang, Jin Yuan, and the others.</p><p>This was supposed to be a great reward, but the other party had passed it over with a light sentence.</p><p>However, the master of the Jin family obviously didn’t want to let it go.</p><p>no, we can’t let him go like this. If we do, our Jin family’s hero would have died in vain!</p><p>“And my son, Yi Xiang!”</p><p>The Masters of the Jin family and the winged World Family shouted. They did not want to let Lu Ming off so easily.</p><p>“Commander Wang has already spoken. What else do you want? are you questioning the judgment of the Heavenly King divine guards?”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch said coldly.</p><p>I’m not questioning commander Wang’s judgment. I’m just questioning whether the evidence of him taking out the nine absolute God crystal is real or fake!</p><p>The master of Jin family said coldly.</p><p>These words made many people’s eyes move.</p><p>That was right. It was difficult to judge whether the evidence Lu Ming produced was real or fake.</p><p>What if it was fake?</p><p>Commander Wang’s brows furrowed again.</p><p>if he really wants to make up for his mistake, he can do it unless he brings back the real nine absolute God crystal. How about this, I will give him a chance. Since he has found the location of the nine absolute God crystal, then he can bring back the nine absolute God crystal by himself.</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan spoke. He glanced around and said, remember, I mean, leave it to him. None of you are allowed to help him, nor are you allowed to send anyone to help him. Let him complete it himself. Only in this way can he make up for his mistakes!</p><p>brother wing, that’s a good suggestion. I agree!</p><p>“I also agree!”</p><p>The Masters of the Jin and Qin families spoke.</p><p>It must be very dangerous for Lu Ming to take back the nine ultimate divine crystal.</p><p>Moreover, they had too many tricks up their sleeves. They could easily make Lu Ming die a horrible death.</p><p>“No way, I object. Isn’t it child’s play to let a heavenly God get the nine absolute divine crystal back?”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch said.</p><p>“If I don’t do this, how can I make up for my mistake?”</p><p>The master of the Jin family didn’t give in at all.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Wu family’s master glared at the Jin family’s master.</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s voice was heard.</p><p>Many people could not help but look at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had agreed?</p><p>alright, Wu Yiyi. This kid has already agreed to it. What else do you have to say? ”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said.</p><p>The Wu family’s family master glanced at Lu Ming and eventually shook his head.</p><p>Lu Ming had already agreed to it. What else could he say?</p><p>LAN Shang’s eyes flickered, but he did not stop her.</p><p>remember, you have to rely on yourself. The blue merchant can’t help you, and the Wu family can’t send anyone to help you. Do you understand? ”</p><p>The master of the Jin family said.</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>very good, then we will wait for your ‘good news’. If you can’t get back the nine absolute God crystal, you will pay with your life!</p><p>The master of the Jin family said.</p><p>“That’s right, then it’s decided!”</p><p>In the end, commander Wang decided.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The Masters of the Jin, winged man, and Qin families cast a cold glance at Lu Ming. Then, they turned around and left with the experts of the three major aristocratic families, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The storm was settled just like that.</p><p>After that, commander Wang also left with his men.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you were too rash when you agreed just now!”</p><p>LAN Shang sighed.</p><p>“I didn’t agree just now, what else can I do?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“The dark ice Clan shouldn’t be weak. Are you confident?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“Although you guys can’t help me, you didn’t say that I can’t borrow other forces. I can still borrow the forces of the Qin heaven star system. It should be enough to deal with the dark ice Race!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m afraid that the Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family will secretly attack you!”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Don’t worry about that. During this period of time, I’ll send people to keep an eye on the three great clans and the experts above Godking.”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch walked over and said.</p><p>however, they will obviously send people to keep an eye on us. So, you can only rely on yourself for this matter!</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch said.</p><p>“En, this time, many thanks to Wu family head for lending a hand, this junior is extremely grateful!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and thanked him.</p><p>“Haha, you’re friends with Zifeng, which means you’re a friend of the woo family. How can I just sit by and do nothing?”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch smiled.</p><p>Then, both parties bade farewell and the Wu family head returned to the Wu family with his men.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he returned to the star sky Camp with LAN Shang.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I have a feeling that your trip won’t be peaceful. Take this treasure!”</p><p>In LAN Shang’s courtyard, LAN Shang warned him. He then waved his hand and a small tower flew out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
