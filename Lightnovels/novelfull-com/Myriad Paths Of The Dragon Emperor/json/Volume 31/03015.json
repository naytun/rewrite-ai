The power of the aura not only shocked the Qin family’s Paragon, but also the other people around him.</p><p>Such an aura was simply stronger than the ninth level heavenly deity Qin clan’s prodigy.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and nine ice chains rushed out from his body.</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>At this moment, the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite finally reacted. With an angry roar, his body glowed and he punched out.</p><p>A huge fist print, as big as a mountain, came crashing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>&Nbsp; three of the ice chains struck the fist seal, causing it to shake and explode, but the ice chains were completely fine.</p><p>After refining the nine vines of the myriad rivers ice vine, the ice chains became extremely tough. It was impossible for the other party to break them.</p><p>The other six ice chains flew forward and continued to attack the Qin clan’s Paragon.</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon’s expression changed drastically. He unleashed all of his strength and even injured himself. He spat out blood and increased the power of his seven injury divine fist.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He threw a few more punches in an attempt to break the ice chains.</p><p>However, after the ice chains collided with the fist seal, they only flicked slightly and changed directions. Then, they continued to attack the Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>A few ice chains pierced through the defense of the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite and wrapped around him.</p><p>A terrifying coldness spread out. A layer of ice immediately appeared on the body of the Qin clan’s heaven’s chosen, making him unable to move at all.</p><p>“Spare me, spare me …”</p><p>The Qin clan’s heaven’s pride expert was scared to death as he roared.</p><p>Outside of the stone platform, the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>It’s over?</p><p>It had only been a few moves, and the Qin clan’s prodigy was already defeated. Wasn’t he defeated too quickly?</p><p>what a powerful secret skill. Lu Ming’s Secret skill is so powerful!</p><p>I didn’t expect that his strength is actually so shocking. Just a fifth level celestial deity, no wonder he can pass through the heavenly gate!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>you wanted to kill me before. Is it possible for you to beg for mercy now? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s indifferent voice was heard. With a single thought, an ice chain was like a sharp spear, piercing towards the other party’s eyebrows.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The other party’s glabella was pierced through, and after struggling for a moment, he died.</p><p>Then, he swung the ice chain and threw the corpse out of the stone platform.</p><p>After settling the Qin family’s prodigy, Lu Ming sat down cross-legged and waited for the day to pass.</p><p>There was only one chance to challenge. If Lu Ming succeeded in his challenge, the others could not continue to challenge him. If they wanted to challenge him, they could only do so three months later.</p><p>Soon, the day came. There was a light screen on the stone platform that enveloped Lu Ming. At this moment, Lu Ming’s vision turned black and he was completely plunged into darkness.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a terrifying roar coming from outside. The world shook violently.</p><p>Lu Ming quickly opened his eyes and was shocked by the scene in front of him.</p><p>In the universe, a group of Giants were fighting.</p><p>The so-called Giants were simply too huge.</p><p>Each giant stood in the universe and was astonishingly burly. Their fists were bigger than a planet.</p><p>Ancient God, or primitive God spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was beating violently.</p><p>All of them were primitive gods.</p><p>A group of primitive godly spirits were fighting fiercely. The universe was boiling, and the stars were falling like meteors. Some stars exploded like fireworks.</p><p>This was the true destruction of the world. In such a great battle, it would not take long for a Galaxy to be destroyed.</p><p>Not good!</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>This was because he saw a ray of divine power rushing towards him. This divine power was filled with an ancient aura. After awakening the origin factor of divine power, it was somewhat similar to this aura, but there was a huge difference. This was the difference in essence.</p><p>That was because this was the original divine power controlled by the original God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was in his throat. His entire body was tense. He wanted to escape but he realized that he could not.</p><p>“Am I going to die Here?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a thought.</p><p>That divine power was too terrifying. If he was hit, he would definitely not be left with even a bit of residue.</p><p>Even a peak Divine King or a figure above Divine King would be killed instantly by such a divine power, let alone him.</p><p>The speed of the divine power was too fast. Lu Ming had only had a few thoughts and the divine power had already struck him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not feel anything at all.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming looked at himself and touched himself. He realized that he was fine.</p><p>It was as if he was transparent. The divine power rushed through his body and struck a huge planet in the distance. The planet exploded with a boom.</p><p>“I’m fine. Are these all illusions?”</p><p>Lu Ming swallowed his saliva and secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Following that, he carefully observed. Indeed, all of this was an illusion and not real. Perhaps it was a projection from countless years ago.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming thought of the God statues on the myriad God cliff. Perhaps, they were projected by the God statues.</p><p>however, the fluctuation of divine power can be felt. Different primitive gods control different divine powers …</p><p>Lu Ming observed carefully, his eyes bright.</p><p>These primordial divine powers controlled different types of origin divine power. Many of the divine-grade divine powers now, if they were traced back to their roots, were most likely evolved from these origin divine powers.</p><p>If he could find the origin divine power that had the same source as the divine-grade divine power he controlled and study it carefully, he would definitely gain a lot.</p><p>No wonder it was said that this place had a great effect on one’s comprehension of divine power, and one could even use it to awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>“I control seven types of divine-grade divine power. Which one should I cultivate first?”</p><p>“I’d better first train in hegemon-level divine power!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming decided to cultivate the God’s divine power first. The God’s divine power was the divine-grade divine power that he had mastered the earliest. He had the deepest understanding of it and it would definitely be easier to cultivate it.</p><p>But first, he had to find a primordial god that controlled the original divine power and had the same origin as the chief divine power.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming tried to move. With a single thought, his body flew out at an unimaginable speed.</p><p>Around him, huge gods were fighting fiercely. However, Lu Ming was not affected at all. He was pierced through.</p><p>“That is the origin Shen power of the sun Shen power!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw a primordial divine power radiating with light all over its body. It was more resplendent than a star. When it went crazy, it grabbed a star as a weapon and threw it at its enemy. It was extremely powerful.</p><p>This primordial godly spirit controlled origin Shen power, which was similar to the sun Shen power.</p><p>Lu Ming happened to be in control of the sun Shen power.</p><p>“Let’s first find the origin divine power of a ruler’s divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming suppressed his excitement and continued to search.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
