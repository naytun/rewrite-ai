He waved his hands and another nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared in the sky. There were nine in total, including the eight nine from before.</p><p>The nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons gathered together and pounced toward the two divine kings.</p><p>The two divine kings also launched a terrifying attack at the nine-clawed Divine Dragon.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A violent boom came from the sky, and a terrifying force scattered in all directions.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of blows. The nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons retreated tens of thousands of meters. However, the two first level Divine King realm experts were also blocked.</p><p>This scene made many people’s eyes widen.</p><p>Lu Ming could even block a Divine King expert. What kind of monster was he?</p><p>.com</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The experts of Kong Xuan sect, including Yue Wuya and the others, were also dumbfounded. Clearly, Lu Ming’s abilities had far exceeded their expectations.</p><p>his strength is inferior to the night Demon Lord!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>&Nbsp; the reason he didn’t use his ancient God Body was to test his strength.</p><p>&Nbsp; he discovered that, although these two godkings were also at the first tier of the Godking realm, they were even weaker than the night Demon King, much less the godkings of the Jin family and winged men.</p><p>The godkings of the Jin clan and the winged man clan were much stronger than him.</p><p>Lu Ming could withstand it even without transforming into his ancient God Body.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>The two God kings felt embarrassed that they could not take down Lu Ming. They flew into a rage out of humiliation and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“I’m done playing with you guys!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming spoke indifferently. Then, his body rapidly grew in size.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into a green-armored ancient God and roared. His violent aura spread in all directions and shook the world.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw two punches at the two divine kings. Two mountainous fist forces headed for the two divine kings. A terrifying whistling sound was heard in the void. The terrifying fist forces crushed the two divine kings and shattered their attacks.</p><p>“This is, No…”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” ah!   the two God kings shrieked in fear. In the next moment, their bodies exploded like watermelons, their bodies and souls destroyed.</p><p>Instant kill!</p><p>The two divine kings were killed by Lu Ming in seconds!</p><p>Time and space seemed to have frozen. At this moment, the scene fell into a dead silence.</p><p>Countless people were dumbfounded. Even the patriarchs of the ice Soul Clan and the red flame clan stopped fighting and looked at the scene in shock.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming became the center of attention and everyone’s eyes were on him.</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>After a moment, the crowd gasped.</p><p>“Oh, oh my God, what did I just see? He killed two God kings!”</p><p>“I’m not dreaming, right? no, I must be dreaming. He’s only a sixth level heavenly deity, how could he possibly kill a God King?”</p><p>“This is crazy!”</p><p>At this moment, the experts from the Scarlet Flame clan, ice Soul Clan, and the Qin heavenly thirteen clans were all shocked. They couldn’t keep calm.</p><p>A sixth firmament celestial God killing a God King, and two of them at that. Furthermore, it was an instant kill. This was simply inconceivable.</p><p>Never heard of it.</p><p>“He, he, he …”</p><p>The ones who were most shocked were the few heaven’s favorites from the three Overlord forces.</p><p>This time, most of the people who came were above the heavenly God Realm. Therefore, some of the top heaven’s favorites from the major forces also came.</p><p>For example, the divine Son of the indestructible sword sect’s sword Dao was boundless.</p><p>The strongest heaven’s favorite of the red flame race, red flame demon song and the others.</p><p>Even Linghu ye of the inextinguishable sword sect was among them.</p><p>However, these people were completely dumbfounded. Their mouths were wide open in horror, and it was obvious that they couldn’t calm down.</p><p>“It seems like my battle with him back then was a joke!”</p><p>Linghu ye smiled bitterly.</p><p>Linghu ye, like Lu Ming, also came from the chaotic astral River.</p><p>Back then, they had participated in the Qin Tian thirteen clans ‘assessment together. In the end, Lu Ming had come in first, while Linghu ye had come in second.</p><p>At that time, Linghu ye was not convinced. He thought that his talent was not inferior to Lu Ming’s and he had made an agreement with Lu Ming to fight him a thousand years later.</p><p>His cultivation had also improved by leaps and bounds over the years, and he had already mastered the divine grade divine power. With his comprehension ability, it was certain that he would master the divine grade divine power in the future and become a Divine Child.</p><p>He was originally high-spirited, but at this moment, when compared to Lu Ming, he realized that he was simply looking at the sky from the bottom of a well. The difference between them was too great. There was no way to compare them.</p><p>The current Lu Ming could kill him with a single breath.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>The deans of the Yimo Academy, the sect master of the immortal sword sect, and the others were filled with fear.</p><p>Lu Ming was too terrifying. It had only been a short while and he had already grown to this stage. In a few more years, would they not be a match for him?</p><p>Kill. Today, he was going to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>He must not let Lu Ming live.</p><p>This was what the sect master of the immortal sword sect, the Dean of the Yimo Academy, and the others all thought.</p><p>“Kill! All second level Divine King realm and above, attack together and kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The sect master of the immortal sword sect, the Dean of the winged demon Academy, and the others gave the order together.</p><p>They didn’t plan to make a move yet.</p><p>They had all obtained the king breakthrough pill and broke through to the fourth level of Godking realm.</p><p>However, their cultivation had just broken through and had not yet fully stabilized. If they attacked now, it would not be good for their Foundation.</p><p>In addition, they wanted to hide their cultivation so that when they fought for hegemony with other forces in the future, they could suddenly reveal their cultivation and catch the other party off guard.</p><p>The leaders of the major forces all had this idea in mind, so they let their subordinates attack first.</p><p>No matter how heaven-defying Lu Ming was, they did not believe that he could be a match for a second level Divine King. Moreover, they had a terrifying third level Divine King among them.</p><p>If these people attacked, even if there were ten Lu Mings, they would still be dead.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As soon as the order was given, a terrifying aura spread out from the major forces. The terrifying pressure spread in all directions, making many people feel as if a mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p>Terrifying experts from all the major forces stepped out.</p><p>Even the weakest of them was at the second level of the God King realm. There were even a few at the third level.</p><p>This was the trump card of the major forces.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>He was indeed no match for these experts.</p><p>“QiuQiu!”</p><p>With a thought, QiuQiu on Lu Ming’s wrist began to wriggle and turned into a suit of armor that enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long hiss and took the initiative to attack.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few experts shouted coldly. Their divine power surged and they launched terrifying attacks at Lu Ming.</p><p>A second level Divine King was much stronger than a first level Divine King. Even if his combat strength could not be compared to the Jin family’s powerhouses of the same level, Lu Ming alone would not be a match for them.</p><p>However, with QiuQiu, it was a different story.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and there were thick bolts of lightning on his fist.</p><p>Huge lightning bolts that were thicker than a person’s waists were shot out, drowning the two Second Sky of King God Realm experts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
