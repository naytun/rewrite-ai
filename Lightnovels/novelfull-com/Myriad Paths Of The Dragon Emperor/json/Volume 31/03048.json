I don’t believe that I can’t go up without a pass!</p><p>Someone shouted. He was not willing to give up just like that. He rushed toward one of the bottom roads and landed on it.</p><p>However, as soon as this person landed on the path, the path glowed and a ball of white light enveloped him. He immediately let out a shrill scream and his body turned into ashes in the white light, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>The others were shocked and gasped.</p><p>As expected, one couldn’t go up without a pass. Otherwise, it would be a dead end.</p><p>The remaining people were secretly glad. Originally, many people who didn’t get the pass wanted to rush up and give it a try. Fortunately, they were a step too late, or they would have been the ones to die.</p><p>Now, they could only look at Lu Ming and the rest with envy.</p><p>Lu Ming and the group strode forward along the small path. Very soon, their figures disappeared into the thick fog.</p><p>Lu Ming walked all the way. Slowly, he could not see anyone else’s figure. He could only see the small path that extended forward under his feet and the thick fog around him.</p><p>This path was very long. Lu Ming had been walking for half an hour but he still had not reached the end.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move forward patiently. After walking for another half an hour, he had no idea how many miles he had traveled. He finally reached the end of the path.</p><p>At the end of the path was a platform, suspended in the chaotic mist.</p><p>Lu Ming came to the small path and realized that there was nothing.</p><p>“Do we have to wait here?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered and then sat cross-legged, waiting quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not wait for long. Not long after, the fog rolled on one side of the platform and a small path extended from the fog. Finally, the platforms under Lu Ming’s feet connected.</p><p>After a while, a young man walked along the path and arrived on the platform.</p><p>The moment the young man came to the platform, he looked at Lu Ming with a sharp gaze.</p><p>the two of you shall fight. Only the winner can continue to move forward!</p><p>A voice suddenly rang out. It was the voice of that formation spirit.</p><p>“So it’s a competition like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Lu Ming did not recognize the young man in front of him. He was not one of the eighteen people who had obtained the travel passes. Clearly, he came from a few other directions.</p><p>The formation spirit wanted to use this method to randomly let the people of the two paths meet and then have a battle, and the winner would continue to advance.</p><p>Lu Ming had encountered such a method before. It had one effect-one would not know who the next person was.</p><p>“Do you want to get lost or do you want me to throw you down?”</p><p>The young man looked at Lu Ming and said coldly, completely disregarding Lu Ming.</p><p>After he entered the castle, he did not walk in the same direction as Lu Ming. Naturally, he had not seen Lu Ming in action and did not know how powerful Lu Ming was.</p><p>From what he could sense, Lu Ming was merely a fifth level celestial deity. How powerful could a fifth level celestial deity be?</p><p>“This sentence is exactly what I wanted to say to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“You’re so stubborn. It seems like you’re going to force me to make a move. Kid, do you know the consequences if I make a move?”</p><p>The young man’s voice was even colder, and his eyes flashed with a cold light, carrying a threatening intent.</p><p>If Lu Ming could roll off the platform by himself, it would save him some effort and he could also save some energy.</p><p>After all, according to this rule, there would definitely be a huge battle ahead. Although Lu Ming was only a fifth-level celestial deity, he would still have to expend some effort, right? Therefore, he threatened Lu Ming to get lost!</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>The other party was full of nonsense, but Lu Ming was impatient. He took a step forward and activated the battle character formula that multiplied his combat power by four. He punched out with both fists.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>Dragon roars were heard continuously as Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons were formed. They carried an astonishing aura as they pounced toward the other party.</p><p>“Your strength …”</p><p>When the other party sensed the nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons ‘shocking aura, his expression changed drastically. He had a look of disbelief on his face.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming made his move, he could sense a strong sense of danger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He also attacked with all his might. His divine power was like a volcanic eruption. He punched out a few times, and with each punch, an Eagle flew out. He punched out more than ten times in a row, and more than ten huge Eagles condensed and pounced at the nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons. They fought each other.</p><p>This young man was also very strong. He was a half-step Divine King and his divine power had awakened to ninety-nine percent. If he didn’t have such strength, he wouldn’t have been able to get a Travel Pass and set foot on this small path.</p><p>He was engaged in an intense battle with Lu Ming and managed to withstand Lu Ming’s attacks.</p><p>It would be difficult for Lu Ming to defeat such an expert without using his ancient God Body.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>With a single thought, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the other party.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming carried his long spear and charged over.</p><p>Lu Ming continuously cast the divine Dragon materialization technique, the ice chain, and the three apocalyptic strikes. His attacks were like a storm, wave after wave. The other party finally could not withstand them.</p><p>After barely holding on for more than ten moves, he was blasted by Lu Ming’s spear and flew towards the platform, spitting out mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>As soon as the other party was blasted off the platform, the small path that the person had been walking on retreated from the platform. He caught the young man and retreated back to his original spot.</p><p>This meant that this person had been eliminated.</p><p>In front of Lu Ming’s platform, another small path appeared and continued to extend forward.</p><p>“Then let’s continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were firm and he was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>If this went on, he would probably encounter geniuses like Jin Yuan, Chu baxing, and you han.</p><p>Lu Ming was not afraid of the battle. He was even looking forward to it.</p><p>He continued to move forward. This time, it did not take long for another platform to appear in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to wait on the platform. Not long after, a small path extended and connected with Lu Ming’s platform. Then, a young and beautiful woman walked up.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>When the woman saw Lu Ming, her expression changed drastically and she looked very ugly.</p><p>This lady was one of the eighteen people who set off with Lu Ming previously. She had seen Lu Ming in action before and she was not his match at all.</p><p>“Beauty, what a coincidence. Why, do you want to fight?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>young master, you’re a man. Can’t you just give way to a little girl? ”</p><p>The woman smiled and blinked at Lu Ming, looking flirtatious.</p><p>“You don’t have to use this trick on me. My wife is much prettier than you, so your trick is ineffective on me!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to smile.</p><p>“You … You’re spouting nonsense!”</p><p>The woman’s face turned red with anger.</p><p>She had always been conceited about her beauty and countless young men had their eyes on her. However, Lu Ming treated her with such an attitude and even said that his wife was much more beautiful than her. How could she not be angry?</p><p>She felt that Lu Ming was lying.</p><p>“Nonsense? I’m not talking nonsense, I’m telling the truth. You want to make a move, right? come on, I won’t show any mercy to a woman!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, a ferocious look flashing in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
