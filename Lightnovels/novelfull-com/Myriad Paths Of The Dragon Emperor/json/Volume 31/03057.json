Rock Spirit?</h1><p>Chapter 3057: Formation spirit? rock spirit?</p><p>The array spirit rambled on and on about how awesome the life soul vitality stone was. It said that it was already a great fortune for Lu Ming to be able to obtain a fragment.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not in the mood to listen. After all the hard work, he only got a piece of fragment. Furthermore, it was useless. He was very unhappy.</p><p>little guy, you can’t underestimate a piece of it. If you can collect all the pieces and turn them into a complete life soul primordial stone, it will be a great fortune for you, which can help you become the Overlord of the primeval universe!</p><p>The array spirit persuaded Lu Ming with all its heart.</p><p>“Become the Overlord of the primal universe? You’re bragging, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not believe it.</p><p>of course it’s true. I can swear that a complete life soul vitality stone’s effects are definitely beyond your imagination!</p><p>The formation spirit solemnly vowed.</p><p>Hearing the array Spirit’s words, Lu Ming was really tempted.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level continued to improve, he saw more and more things. His horizons were also broadened and his understanding of the primeval universe also increased.</p><p>However, the more he understood, the more he was in awe.</p><p>The primal universe was too big, too big, too big.</p><p>In the boundless primal universe, there were countless races, countless experts, and countless powerful forces.</p><p>Even a universal power like the great void Holy dynasty only occupied a small corner of the primal universe, much less the Qin heaven star system.</p><p>In the primal universe, there were countless empires like the great void Holy dynasty or powers of the same level.</p><p>There were even powers that were more terrifying than the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>No one knew how many terrifying experts there were in the desolate universe.</p><p>Perhaps, on some remote planet, there was an invincible expert living in seclusion.</p><p>Therefore, it was too difficult to become the Overlord of the primeval universe.</p><p>There were countless experts in the universe, but how many of them dared to call themselves overlords?</p><p>The array spirit had actually said that as long as he obtained a complete life soul vitality stone, it could help him become the Overlord of the universe. Lu Ming could not help but be tempted.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming’s eyes had lit up, the array spirit continued, ” so, work hard and look for the remaining pieces of your life soul and vitality stone. You are very talented, and I have high hopes for you!</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the array spirit. Why did he feel that the array spirit was hoping that Lu Ming would go and find the remaining fragments? it seemed to be more anxious than Lu Ming.</p><p>“How do we find the remaining fragments?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>a life soul vitality stone is a rare treasure. Even if it’s a fragment, it’s still a rare treasure with spirituality. It will find an opportunity to be born, find a suitable heaven’s favorite, and recognize him as its master, just like you!</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>who do you mean to say that the other fragments will also be obtained by other paragons and become the owners of the life soul primordial stone fragments? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>that’s right. Therefore, you can only obtain the other person’s life soul primordial stone fragment by killing other paragons who have life soul primordial stone fragments. Only in this way will the other person’s life soul primordial stone fragment recognize you as its master and merge with your life soul primordial stone fragment!</p><p>The formation spirit explained.</p><p>“Then Where can I find those heaven’s favorites? The primeval universe is so big, isn’t it like looking for a needle in a haystack?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>of course not. Life soul vitality stone fragments have a strange connection with each other. As the owners of the life soul vitality stone fragments, they will eventually meet under that subtle connection. Once they meet, you will know who the owner of the life soul vitality stone is!</p><p>but let me tell you, unless you’re a peerless genius, you won’t recognize a life soul vitality stone fragment as your master. So, if you meet a genius in the future, it’ll definitely be a terrifying one. You have to work hard and improve your strength. You’re still too weak!</p><p>The formation spirit continued to explain.</p><p>life soul and vitality stone fragments. I don’t want them, okay? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said, feeling rather speechless.</p><p>He had obtained the life soul and vitality stone fragments, but he did not get any benefits. Instead, a group of enemies had appeared out of thin air. He was even more displeased.</p><p>no, you’re already bleeding. You can’t refuse it even if you don’t want it. Paragons with life soul vitality stones are destined to be enemies. Even if you don’t kill others, others will kill you. Young man, work hard!</p><p>The formation spirit continued, its eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that he had fallen into a trap.</p><p>He didn’t get any benefits, but he got himself a group of potential enemies, and they were all extremely terrifying enemies.</p><p>“Senior, how do I get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. He could only accept his fate. He would leave first.</p><p>the platform under your feet is a teleportation array that can help you leave this place. You just have to pour your divine power into the altar.</p><p>With that, the formation spirit turned into a rainbow light and flew into the life soul primordial stone, disappearing.</p><p>At the sight of this scene, Lu Ming’s eyes widened. He felt that something was not right and shouted, ” “Wait, come out!”</p><p>The life soul and origin stone fragments glowed, and the formation Spirit’s figure appeared again.</p><p>“Little guy, why did you call this old man?”</p><p>The formation spirit asked.</p><p>“Aren’t you the formation spirit of this place? How did it end up in a life soul and vitality stone fragment?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Cough, cough, I am indeed such a formation spirit!”</p><p>The ‘formation spirit’ coughed a few times and said without a blush or a beating heart.</p><p>“Old man, you lied to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and said, ” since you’re the array spirit of this place, you must stay here forever and be the companion of the array. You entered the life soul vitality stone fragment to leave. How can an array spirit leave? ”</p><p>“So, you’re not the formation spirit. Who are you? Why did you lie to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the ‘array spirit’ without blinking.</p><p>He felt that he had been tricked by this old man.</p><p>cough, cough, cough. Hahaha, little guy, you’re indeed a peerless prodigy. You’re not simple to be able to get the recognition of a life soul vitality stone fragment. You’re very meticulous. To tell you the truth, I’m not the array spirit. I’m the rock spirit of the life soul vitality stone!</p><p>The old man coughed a few times and laughed.</p><p>“A rock spirit with a life soul vitality stone? Then why did you lie to me before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, still staring at the old man.</p><p>“I didn’t tell you before because I wanted to test you and see if you could see it. You really didn’t disappoint this old man!”</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>Bullshit, this old man was definitely bullsh * tting.</p><p>He even said that he wanted to test Lu Ming. He was definitely boasting shamelessly.</p><p>“Old man, you’re really shameless!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the old man. This guy said that he was a rock spirit and Lu Ming believed him. Otherwise, he would not have been able to enter the life soul primordial stone fragment so easily.</p><p>“Ahem, little guy, what are you saying? how can you say that about an old man like me?”</p><p>The rock spirit coughed a few more times.</p><p>if I’m not wrong, every piece of life soul vitality stone fragment has a rock spirit, right? as long as you can kill the other elites who have obtained life soul vitality stone fragments, not only can you fuse with the life soul vitality stone fragments, you can also devour other Rock Spirits to strengthen yourself, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
