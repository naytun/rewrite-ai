Could it be that Lu Ming still had a trump card?</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming’s confident expression, Yue Wuya did not say anything more.</p><p>“It’s impossible for your cultivation to suddenly break through in such a short time. You must have taken a ‘King breakthrough pill’!”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the sect master of the eternal sword sect and the other two as he spoke indifferently.</p><p>The expressions of the sect master and the other two changed slightly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you don’t have to care how we broke through. It’s fine as long as we can kill you,”</p><p>The demonic Academy’s College chief coldly said.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. According to what I know, although the king breakthrough pill can make a breakthrough in a short period of time, the price is to exhaust your potential in advance, so that your cultivation will never be able to break through!</p><p>.com</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The sect master of the eternal sword sect and the others ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>They had no idea that the king breakthrough pill had such a side effect.</p><p>However, they quickly regained their calm.</p><p>With their talent, it was already very difficult for them to break through. They might be stuck at the third level of Godking realm for the rest of their lives. Now that they could break through to the fourth level of Godking realm, it was worth it.</p><p>Even if he could no longer break through in the future, he would still be an Overlord-level expert of the Qin heaven Starfield.</p><p>“The Qin heaven star region doesn’t have a ‘King breakthrough pill’ at all. Tell me, who gave you the ‘King breakthrough pill’?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked loudly.</p><p>you’re about to die. You talk too much nonsense. There are some things that you’re not qualified to know!</p><p>die! the sect leader of the indestructible sword sect shouted coldly. His aura was violent, and a terrifying sword pressure firmly locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming laughed in his heart. Even if the other party did not reply, he could guess that the king breakthrough pill was most likely given to him by the Jin family and the winged people family. It was not convenient for their own experts to come over, so they wanted to send the Qin heaven Starfield’s forces to kill Lu Ming. They had a good plan.</p><p>“Come on, I’m afraid the three of you are not enough. Come at me together, Scarlet Flame tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>He wanted to destroy the core of the enemy’s combat power in one fell swoop.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The sect master of the immortal sword sect, the Dean of the unique demon Academy, and the others shouted coldly and directly attacked.</p><p>A beam of sword light cut through the sky and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the Dean of the unique demon Academy struck out with his palm. A demonic palm covered a radius of a thousand miles and headed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The two overlords of the Qin heaven Starfield attacked at the same time. Their strength was world-shaking, and no one in the Qin heaven Starfield could ignore them.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and transformed into a giant kun Peng, charging in one direction.</p><p>“If you want to leave, then stay!”</p><p>die! the Dean of the winged demon Academy shouted coldly. Demonic Qi surged and his demonic palm enlarged rapidly, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and threw a punch. Bolts of lightning burst out from his fist and intertwined with each other, blasting toward the demonic palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning struck the demonic palm, causing it to shake violently. Eventually, a hole was blasted open. Lu Ming rushed past it and soared straight into the starry sky.</p><p>“I told you, you can’t kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed as he flew.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect shouted and turned into a beam of sword light to give chase.</p><p>At the same time, the Dean of the wing demon Academy and the Saint Lord of the boundless Holy Land also gave chase.</p><p>They must not let Lu Ming go today. If he did not die, his combat strength would surpass theirs in no time.</p><p>On the other side, the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan’s expression changed. He then soared into the sky and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His thoughts were similar to the others. He had to kill Lu Ming and not let him rise. Therefore, he joined the ranks of the people who were attacking Lu Ming without hesitation.</p><p>“Despicable!”</p><p>Yue Wuya, the ice Soul clan’s clan leader, and the others shouted in anger.</p><p>The clan leader of the red flame clan and the Dean of the wing demon Academy were both overlords. They had actually joined forces to deal with a junior. They were simply shameless.</p><p>But they couldn’t do anything, so they could only worry.</p><p>“They’re finally attacking together?”</p><p>No one noticed that the corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up into a faint smile.</p><p>What he wanted was for the patriarch of the Scarlet Flame clan to attack together so that he could capture them all in one fell swoop.</p><p>He had pretended to escape earlier to lure the Scarlet Flame tribe’s patriarch to attack together.</p><p>Lu Ming’s flying figure suddenly stopped.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stopped, the Dean of the wing demon Academy and the others caught up with him immediately.</p><p>The four experts had Lu Ming surrounded.</p><p>“Let’s see where you’re going to run to now.”</p><p>The headmaster of the winged demon Academy said ferociously.</p><p>don’t talk nonsense with him. Attack together and kill him!</p><p>The sect leader of the eternal sword sect shouted. He did not know why, but he felt very uncertain when facing a junior like Lu Ming. He could not wait to kill Lu Ming immediately. Only then would he be at ease.</p><p>“We were just waiting for you guys!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and a small Pagoda flew out of his hand.</p><p>This small tower was the king’s Pagoda that LAN Shang had given him.</p><p>As soon as the king-suppressing Pagoda flew out, it expanded rapidly and turned into a giant Pagoda. It exuded a mysterious wave that enveloped the Dean of the wing demon Academy, the sect master of the immortal sword sect, the Saint Lord of the boundless Holy Land, and the clan leader of the red flame tribe.</p><p>Once they were enveloped by the king-suppressing Pagoda, the divine power of the Four Masters fluctuated, and their auras weakened greatly.</p><p>“What’s going on? What’s going on?”</p><p>“What kind of treasure is this?”</p><p>The four of them shouted in fear.</p><p>They had never seen such a treasure before.</p><p>Even in the Qin heaven Galaxy, a treasure like the king suppression Pagoda was relatively rare. Furthermore, most of them could only affect low-level godkings like first and second level godkings.</p><p>Those that could affect fourth firmament godkings were relatively rare. They were personally refined by LAN Shang.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and was the first to attack the Dean of the winged demon Academy.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>QiuQiu transformed into an armor and its power was completely under Lu Ming’s control.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist and endless lightning filled the air. It turned into a Lightning Spear and pierced towards the Dean of the winged demon Academy.</p><p>The Dean of the winged demon Academy shouted angrily and made a move with all his strength.</p><p>However, his star core was suppressed by the king’s Pagoda. When he tried to mobilize his divine power, he was met with great resistance. In a hurry, he could only mobilize 60 to 70 percent of his power to launch a palm strike.</p><p>However, the Dean of the winged demon Academy had broken through by force with the help of the king breakthrough pill. Moreover, he had just broken through not long ago and his Foundation was not stable. Although he had a cultivation base of the fourth level of the divine King realm, his ability was the weakest among the fourth level of the divine King realm. He could not withstand Lu Ming and QiuQiu’s full-powered attack at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning Spear struck the demonic palm of the headmaster of the winged demon Academy and pierced through it. The spear did not stop and flashed past.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The long spear pierced through the forehead of the Dean of the winged demon Academy. The Dean of the winged demon Academy stood there stiffly, his eyes filled with fear and disbelief.</p><p>&Nbsp; he screamed as his body exploded. Countless tiny lightning bolts burst out from his body.</p><p>The Dean of the winged demon Academy had fallen!</p><p>The people who witnessed this scene were almost scared to death.</p><p>The headmaster of the winged demon Academy, one of the overlords of the Qin heaven Galaxy, had actually died just like that. Killed by a junior.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
