There was no need for all five of them to work together to attract the desolate beasts. As long as a few of them attracted the desolate beasts, the other few could easily pick the nine-petal ice Lotus.</p><p>Who would be so foolish to attract the dire beasts together and leave the treasures here?</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming knew that the other party was lying after some thought.</p><p>Sneering coldly, Lu Ming kept the nine-petaled ice Lotus in his storage ring.</p><p>“Kid, it seems like you’re not going to hand it over?”</p><p>The white-haired youth’s eyes were cold, and the coldness on his body became stronger and stronger.</p><p>The other party clearly also cultivated cold attribute divine-grade divine power, so he was not afraid of the cold nether energy here.</p><p>“Since I’ve already obtained it, how can I hand it over?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Very good, very good!”</p><p>The white-haired youth nodded. Lu Ming, your talent is not bad. You’ve crossed the heavenly gates. However, your cultivation is only at the fourth-level celestial deity realm. Do you think you can swallow the nine-petal ice Lotus in front of us with such a cultivation? ”</p><p>After saying that, the white-haired young man’s aura completely bloomed.</p><p>Half-step Divine King!</p><p>The white-haired young man was a half-step Divine King.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could tell at a glance that the other party had not awakened the divine power factor.</p><p>At the same time, the rest of them moved in a flash and surrounded Lu Ming, each of them exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>Another half-step Divine King.</p><p>The other three were also ninth level celestial deity existences.</p><p>However, no one had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>The origin divine power factor was not that easy to awaken.</p><p>There were so many prodigies below the divine King realm in the star Battalion, but only four of them had passed the heavenly gate. Including the beautiful lady, there were only five of them.</p><p>Naturally, he wouldn’t encounter a person who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly. He was not afraid.</p><p>As long as he had not awakened the divine power factor, Lu Ming was not afraid of even a half-step Divine King. Even if he could not defeat them, he could still escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ve given you a chance just now, but you didn’t cherish it. Now, not only will you hand over the nine-petaled ice Lotus, but you’ll also have to hand over everything else you have!”</p><p>also, open up your dantian and sea of consciousness. Let us search. We can consider sparing your life!</p><p>The white-haired youth spoke again, his eyes flashing with greed.</p><p>He thought of how Lu Ming was able to cross the heavenly gates with just a fourth-level celestial deity. He must have had a great opportunity on him.</p><p>Now, not only did he want the nine-petaled ice Lotus, but he also wanted the opportunity on Lu Ming.</p><p>He even had an even more vicious plan in mind.</p><p>He planned to wait for Lu Ming to hand over all the treasures before crippling his cultivation and imprisoning him. He would then slowly dig out all the secrets on Lu Ming.</p><p>At the thought of being able to obtain Lu Ming’s Secret and rise to the top, his heart burned with passion.</p><p>“It seems that you are quite ambitious!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered coldly and was ready to find an opening to escape.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming’s expression changed and he looked at the sky.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, a sword light appeared, and then the figure of a beautiful woman appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face turned bitter.</p><p>If this wasn’t that absolute beauty, who could it be?</p><p>“Enemies really meet on a narrow road, meeting again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth was full of bitterness.</p><p>He had just been surrounded by the white-haired young man and the rest, and now there was a beautiful woman. This situation was not good for Lu Ming.</p><p>He was confident that he could get rid of the white-haired young man and the others, but with the addition of the absolute beauty, he had no way to escape.</p><p>“We’re in trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled. Of course, he would not give up. His mind whirred as he tried to find a way to escape.</p><p>“What a beautiful woman!”</p><p>When the white-haired youth and the others saw the beautiful woman, they couldn’t help but be stunned.</p><p>“You guys, get lost!”</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s gaze swept across the white-haired young man and the others as she coldly shouted.</p><p>His words made the white-haired young man and the others ‘faces turn ugly.</p><p>“It seems that you and this kid are in cahoots. Little girl, I’m afraid that you alone won’t be enough to save him!”</p><p>The white-haired youth sneered.</p><p>“Who’s going to save him? I’m going to kill him!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said coldly.</p><p>“Kill him?”</p><p>This time, the white-haired youth and the others were stunned again.</p><p>They initially thought that the absolute beauty was here to save Lu Ming. They did not expect that she was here to kill him.</p><p>miss, you’re here to kill him? haha, it seems like we’re on the same side. This brat stole our treasure, so we have to kill him too. Why don’t I kill this brat on your behalf? I don’t want him to dirty your hands!</p><p>The white-haired youth laughed.</p><p>The moment he heard that the absolute beauty was also here to kill Lu Ming, the white-haired young man immediately changed his attitude. He looked as if he wanted to get closer to the absolute beauty.</p><p>“If he wants to die, he can only die in my hands. Are you not qualified to kill him?”</p><p>However, the absolute beauty clearly didn’t appreciate it and continued to speak coldly.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Lu Ming was also stunned.</p><p>He couldn’t figure out the tricks of this beautiful woman at all.</p><p>Since she wanted to kill Lu Ming, what was the difference between her killing him and the others killing him?</p><p>Why must Lu Ming die in her hands?</p><p>At this moment, even Lu Ming could not help but suspect that he had really drunk too much and done something to let the lady down.</p><p>However, he had no impression of it at all. He didn’t feel anything at all. If it was true, he would have suffered a great loss.</p><p>The white-haired youth and company were also dazed. They didn’t understand what the absolute beauty meant.</p><p>“It seems that you want to save him!”</p><p>The white-haired youth said coldly.</p><p>He guessed that the absolute beauty wanted to save Lu Ming and deliberately said that she wanted to kill him to deceive them.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted coldly.</p><p>Hmph, you’re really in cahoots. Then I’ll take you down as well!</p><p>The white-haired young man’s face darkened, and a powerful aura enveloped the beautiful woman.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, the white-haired young man took a step forward and stretched out his palm. A huge palm formed. This palm was made of ice and was filled with a terrible chill. It grabbed at the beautiful woman.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the absolute Beauty’s eyes turned cold, and she exuded an ancient aura.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the absolute beauty waved her hand, and a sword light suddenly appeared, slashing toward the white-haired young man.</p><p>With a poof, the big hand formed by the white-haired young man was directly split in half. The sword light did not stop and continued to cut towards the white-haired young man.</p><p>‘Origin divine power factor … You’ve awakened the origin divine power factor …”</p><p>The white-haired young man roared in fear and retreated. At the same time, a shield flew out from his forehead.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword light struck the shield, causing sparks to fly. The shield was sent flying, and a deep crack appeared on it.</p><p>The white-haired youth’s face was deathly pale.</p><p>This was a ninth level upper grade defensive divine artifact, yet it was directly broken through by the other party’s sword.</p><p>The rest of the young men also looked horrified. They could not help but retreat to keep a distance from the beautiful woman.</p><p>The beautiful woman took a step forward, and her sword Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>wait a minute, it’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding …</p><p>The white-haired youth shouted in fear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
