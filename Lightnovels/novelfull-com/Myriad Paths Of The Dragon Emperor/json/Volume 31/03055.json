Moreover, he was killed by a fifth level heavenly deity. If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, it would be hard to believe.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming with fear and solemness in their eyes.</p><p>If Lu Ming could kill Chu baxing, it meant that he could kill them too.</p><p>However, there were two exceptions. They were the two geniuses of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>You han, in particular, had a strange cultivation technique, so he wasn’t too worried.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strongest attack was not freakishly strong. You han was confident that he could withstand it. However, he was more afraid of Chu baxing’s Whirlpool.</p><p>You han wasn’t confident in facing that move.</p><p>However, you han was confident that he could handle Lu Ming’s strongest move,’star explosion’.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming had used five to six consecutive Star Blast moves to defeat Chu baxing.</p><p>However, you han was not Chu baxing. He would not be so foolish as to allow Lu Ming to attack him continuously. He had enough ways to deal with Lu Ming in the gaps between his attacks.</p><p>Therefore, his eyes were still filled with confidence.</p><p>After Lu Ming killed Chu baxing, Chu baxing’s small path disappeared. The fighting ring also disappeared. Lu Ming returned to his own small path.</p><p>The next match was naturally you han against the genius from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The genius from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor admitted defeat.</p><p>He and you han both came from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion. Naturally, he knew that he was no match for you han, so he admitted defeat without hesitation.</p><p>The last two people left were you han and Lu Ming.</p><p>this is the last battle. The winner will receive the life soul vitality stone. Go all out!</p><p>The formation spirit spoke and waved its hand. The small path under Lu Ming and you Han’s feet extended and converged to form a fighting ring.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>You Han’s figure rushed up to the fighting ring and he looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“Come, come up and die!”</p><p>You han shouted.</p><p>“Why are you all so confident?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and stepped onto the fighting ring.</p><p>On the fighting ring, a light shield immediately covered it.</p><p>because I’m strong, I’m confident!</p><p>You han laughed coldly. Before he could finish his sentence, he had already charged towards Lu Ming at lightning speed.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the ancient God tactic and turned into a green-armored ancient God. He shook his spear and dozens of spear lights shot out toward you han.</p><p>However, you Han’s body was like a ghostly shadow as he rushed toward Lu Ming. In a flash, he dodged the Spear’s radiance and continued to rush toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, all of this was within Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>Lu Ming had fought with you Lian before and he already had some idea of the other party’s means.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear trembled and a crescent-shaped spear radiance slashed at you han.</p><p>A mist came out of you Han’s body, and it was as if there were endless cries coming from within the mist.</p><p>His body trembled continuously as he dispelled the power of the moon-cutting technique.</p><p>The moon slash did not cause much damage to him. You han continued to charge at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nine nether ghostclaw!”</p><p>die! you han shouted coldly. A ghostly claw formed and grabbed at Lu Ming. His eyes were filled with excitement as if he could see the scene of Lu Ming being killed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The energy of the nine netherworld ghostclaw struck Lu Ming’s body. The strange energy passed through Lu Ming’s body and rushed toward his soul.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s soul was protected by the shocking feathers painting scroll. The energy that struck the painting did not have any effect on Lu Ming’s soul.</p><p>You han was waiting for Lu Ming’s soul to be attacked and his strength to weaken so that he could launch a thunderous attack. However, what he had been waiting for was Lu Ming’s thunderous attack.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and cast the star explosion. A terrifying spear ray shot towards you han and exploded. The destructive energy enveloped you han.</p><p>“How could this be? How is that possible?”</p><p>You han shrieked in shock. At the same time, he retreated as a dense mist spread out from his body. Ghostly figures appeared one after another to resist the destructive energy in the surroundings.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>A large number of ghostly figures turned into ashes under the destructive energy and completely disappeared.</p><p>In the end, you han retreated out of the attack range. However, his face was pale. It was obvious that he had suffered a great loss from this move.</p><p>His eyes were filled with rage as he glared at Lu Ming. The move just now had caused him to suffer a great loss.</p><p>“Kid, how did you manage to block my soul attack?”</p><p>You han roared.</p><p>“Idiot, why should I tell you!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked down on the other party. He took a step forward and charged at the other party.</p><p>lucky, it must be luck. I don’t believe it!</p><p>You han roared and pounced on Lu Ming again.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was the same as the previous time. When his attack landed on Lu Ming, it did not affect him at all.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and cast star burst. You Han’s face turned pale and he lost another large number of ghostly shadows.</p><p>damn it, damn it, you’re actually not afraid of the soul attack. That’s right, you must have a treasure to protect your soul!</p><p>You han roared.</p><p>“It’s too late to know now!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Too late? It’s not too late. Lu Ming, do you think you can kill me? As long as I use all my strength to Dodge, your attacks will not be able to reach me. No matter how much divine power you have, there will be a time when you will run out. I will exhaust you to death!”</p><p>You han roared and the mist around her grew thicker, almost covering the entire fighting ring. At the same time, ghostly shadows flickered in the mist. You Han’s body flickered continuously as well, as if she was one with the ghostly shadows, making it difficult for others to track her.</p><p>Even if Lu Ming was not afraid of soul attacks, he was not afraid either. Lu Ming’s strongest attack was not as strong as Chu baxing’S. He only had to avoid it. It would be difficult for him to be severely injured in one hit.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile. With a thought, the ice chains flew out.</p><p>As soon as the nine ice chains flew out, they rapidly grew longer and circled around the battle stage. A terrifying chill spread out and layers of ice crystals appeared in the void. The ghostly figures were frozen.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>You han was shocked.</p><p>I’ll shrink the area of the fighting ring. Let’s see how you’re going to Dodge.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, controlling the ice chains to dance and circle around the fighting ring. Very soon, the entire fighting ring was covered with ice chains and the space in the fighting ring was shrinking rapidly.</p><p>you want to trap me? dream on! All you have to do is destroy these chains!</p><p>You han shrieked and began to attack, constantly bombarding the ice chains.</p><p>However, the ice chain only shook a few times and did not break.</p><p>You Han’s expression changed completely.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can it be so hard?”</p><p>You han cried out in fear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
