He pondered if he had any treasures on him that could resist soul attacks.</p><p>But the answer was no.</p><p>Lu Ming had many treasures but most of them were various divine artifacts. Ordinary divine artifacts could not withstand soul attacks at all.</p><p>that’s right, the startled feather painting and the purple copper coffin are the two most Mysterious Treasures I have. I wonder if they can block soul attacks!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming thought of the shocking feather painting and the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>Needless to say, the purple bronze coffin was extremely mysterious. Lu Ming rarely touched it.</p><p>Jingyu’s painting was also rather mysterious. In the beginning, Lu Ming had thought that it was just an ordinary painting with the word ‘battle’ on it. Later, when Lu Ming found out about Jingyu, the word ‘battle’ had disappeared.</p><p>After that, the bone demon actually appeared from the startled feather scroll. Lu Ming also knew that there was a space within the startled feather scroll, and the purple copper coffin was hidden in it.</p><p>Lu Ming’s understanding of the stunning feather painting scroll was very limited.</p><p>Now, he could only take a gamble.</p><p>If this went on, Lu Ming would really die in the hands of you Lian.</p><p>With a single thought, Lu Ming controlled the shocking feathers painting scroll and flew towards his soul. Then, it wrapped around his soul like a piece of cloth.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming and you Lian exchanged another blow. A strange energy entered Lu Ming’s body from you Lian’s hand and blasted toward his soul.</p><p>However, at this moment, the startling feather scroll emitted a layer of light. The strange energy that attacked the light disappeared immediately. Lu Ming’s soul was completely fine.</p><p>he blocked it! He actually blocked it!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>He had not expected that the startled feathers painting scroll would actually be able to block the other party’s soul attack.</p><p>He was just giving it a try. He didn’t expect it to really work.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared as he came to his senses. His divine power erupted like a volcano, turning into a terrifying spear radiance that shot towards you Lian.</p><p>You Lian had initially thought that he had shaken Lu Ming’s soul and was about to continue his attack to aggravate Lu Ming’s injuries. He had never expected that Lu Ming would be as lively as a Dragon and a Tiger. He did not seem to be affected at all and even launched a terrifying attack.</p><p>“Not good …”</p><p>You Lian’s expression changed drastically. At this critical moment, he wanted to retreat, but he was still a step too late.</p><p>The spearlight struck you Lian’s body accurately. You Lian cried out in pain as his body was sent flying. His body swayed as blood flowed from the corner of his mouth. His aura had also weakened.</p><p>so you can get hurt too. I thought you were immune to my attacks!</p><p>Lu Ming mocked.</p><p>brat, you’re looking for death. I’ll make you die miserably. Kill!</p><p>You Lian shrieked and transformed into a figure, charging towards Lu Ming again.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and waved his long spear, clashing with you Lian.</p><p>When the two of them collided, another strange energy rushed toward Lu Ming’s soul. However, it was blocked by the shocking feathers painting scroll.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul was not affected at all. He attacked with all his might and launched his strongest move.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming seized the opportunity and blasted out the supernova.</p><p>A huge spear radiance shot out and exploded, forming waves of destructive power that charged towards you Lian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>You Lian was immediately engulfed by the destructive power, and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>He retreated a thousand meters before he stopped. His body seemed to have become smaller, and there was a cloud of smoke that dissipated into the air.</p><p>That was you Lian’s soul power.</p><p>You Lian’s cultivation technique was strange. His divine body wasn’t strong, but his soul power was extremely strong.</p><p>You Lian had been severely injured by that move. Lu Ming had obliterated a large amount of his soul power, and his strength had plummeted.</p><p>“Why? Why aren’t you afraid of my soul attack?”</p><p>You Lian howled in disbelief.</p><p>Anyone who was attacked by him would have their soul tremble and their strength weakened.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s abilities did not weaken at all.</p><p>“It’s just a small trick, and you want to hurt me?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. When he said this, he was really acting cool.</p><p>“Hmph, Lu Ming, I’ll let you off today. One day, you’ll die by my hands!”</p><p>You Lian said coldly. His expression was extremely malevolent, filled with unwillingness.</p><p>However, he still decided to leave.</p><p>He would think of a way to kill Lu Ming another day.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming did not have the intention to let him off.</p><p>“You want to leave? Did I say I’m letting you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and crossed a thousand meters. Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons formed and pounced on you Lian from all directions.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>You Lian’s figure flickered strangely and dodged the divine Dragon phenomenon’s attack.</p><p>“Kid, I want to leave. No one can stop me!”</p><p>You Lian’s disdainful voice rang out.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. All of a sudden, ice chains flew out from all directions, forming a heaven encompassing land that covered the sky and earth.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s ice chain. When he was speaking earlier, Lu Ming had already used the ice chain to trap the enemy instead of attacking.</p><p>As soon as the ice chains appeared, the terrifying coldness on them completely exploded.</p><p>&Nbsp; ka ka ka …</p><p>Countless ice crystals appeared on the ground and even in the air. The entire world seemed to have turned into a World of Ice.</p><p>A layer of ice appeared on you Lian’s body.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>You Lian’s expression changed drastically. His figure flickered as he tried to leave.</p><p>However, the ice chains continued to circle around him, filling the air with a cold aura. More and more ice crystals appeared in the air, completely blocking you Lian’s path.</p><p>The chill continued to surge towards you Lian, trying to seal him in ice.</p><p>Just now, you Lian was injured by Lu Ming’s ‘star explosion’ and his ability was greatly reduced. At this moment, he could not withstand the coldness that was emitted by the cold ice chain.</p><p>He felt like all the blood in his body was about to freeze, and his speed was greatly reduced.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and thrust his long spear. In an instant, he had stabbed more than ten times. More than ten spearlights overlapped and all of them hit you Lian.</p><p>You Lian screamed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s dozens of spear gleams stacked together. It was terrifying. You Lian’s body exploded in an instant.</p><p>The strange thing was that after you Lian’s body exploded, he turned into countless ghostly shadows, howling and shouting.</p><p>They were like countless vengeful souls.</p><p>“How many people’s souls has this guy devoured?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned colder.</p><p>These vengeful spirit-like things were most likely souls that had been swallowed by the other party.</p><p>At this moment, these vengeful spirit-like things actually gathered together again and transformed into you Lian’s figure.</p><p>However, at this moment, you Lian’s aura was extremely weak.</p><p>It was a dozen times more dispirited than before, as if it was about to fall at any moment.</p><p>His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>you’re still not dead? your vitality is quite tenacious. Let’s see if you’ll die after one more move!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
