Yi Xiang and Jin Yuan were both dead.</p><p>“If we had known earlier, we would have stayed nearby. Once this brat appears, we would have killed him!”</p><p>An elder of the Jin family roared.</p><p>They had been guarding the surroundings just in case. They had not planned to take action. They had never expected things to turn out this way.</p><p>“Since you want to protect this brat, then I’ll kill you as well!”</p><p>die! an elder of the winged man race shouted in anger. His aura exploded and Thunder rumbled. It was terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure out the other party’s cultivation. He only had one feeling-it was terrifying.</p><p>This kind of existence was already not something he could deal with. A casual wave of the hand could kill him in an instant.</p><p>.com</p><p>However, Lu Ming had come prepared today.</p><p>As expected, a voice came from the side as soon as the winged man elder finished speaking. “What big words. Let’s see who you can kill.”</p><p>Following that, many figures flashed and stood around Lu Ming.</p><p>All of them were experts from the woo family. There were more than ten of them, and each of them was extremely powerful.</p><p>In order to help Lu Ming this time, the Wu family had mobilized a large number of powerhouses and did not hesitate to go against the three major aristocratic families.</p><p>Lu Ming was very grateful for this.</p><p>More than a dozen Wu family experts released their auras and confronted the experts from the three aristocratic families.</p><p>“It seems like the woo family is well-prepared!”</p><p>The old winged man said coldly.</p><p>The Jin and Qin family’s people also looked extremely gloomy.</p><p>At the sight of this scene, they did not understand that they had fallen into Lu Ming’s trap.</p><p>They had schemed against Lu Ming, but he had schemed against them instead. Clearly, Lu Ming had anticipated that there would be danger and had formed an alliance with the Wu family long ago. He had ordered the Wu family’s experts to lie in ambush and provide support at any time.</p><p>“Is the woo family going to start a war with us three aristocratic families for this kid?”</p><p>An old man from the Jin family said coldly, his voice full of threat.</p><p>“If you want to start a war, so be it. Do you think my Wu family is afraid of you?”</p><p>A burly man from the Wu family responded strongly.</p><p>This time, the Wu family’s family head had personally given the order to protect Lu Ming’s life no matter what. They would not be afraid of the other party’s threats.</p><p>Moreover, the Wu family, the Jin family, and the Qin family had always been at odds with each other. In the past, conflicts often broke out, and the hatred between the three families was very deep.</p><p>How could the Wu family compromise in front of the Jin and Qin families?</p><p>“Since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>An elder of the winged man race bellowed. The wings on his back enlarged rapidly. With a flap, he pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, an expert of the Wu family strode out and waved his hand. Tens of thousands of horses galloped forward and huge war horses appeared, charging at the winged Men Expert.</p><p>The two of them collided and exchanged a few moves, but it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other experts of the three aristocratic families moved as well. They unleashed their cultivation and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Protect young master Lu Ming!”</p><p>An old man from the Wu family ordered.</p><p>At once, more than ten powerhouses from the Wu family formed a wall, shielding Lu Ming behind them as they fought against the powerhouses from the three major aristocratic families.</p><p>&Nbsp; instantly, the entire area boiled. A terrifying aura filled the air, exuding a destructive power.</p><p>The battle between so many King God Realm experts was enough to threaten the life of a planet.</p><p>However, this was the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>As everyone was fighting, their auras reached a certain level, and thick runes appeared on the ground.</p><p>Each of these runes was extremely thick, like divine Dragons. They intertwined on the ground and formed a large formation to protect the safety of the planet.</p><p>In a place like the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the entire planet had long been set up with a planet formation. Otherwise, with so many experts in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, a war would be inevitable.</p><p>Without the protection of the formation, the entire planet would have been destroyed.</p><p>With the protection of the formation, the power of everyone’s battle was completely negated.</p><p>Both parties fought intensely. However, the Wu family’s experts were focused on protecting Lu Ming. They did not seek to gain any merits but to avoid any mistakes. The other party could not kill Lu Ming even if they wanted to.</p><p>After exchanging dozens of blows, the experts from the three aristocratic families retreated with gloomy expressions.</p><p>good, very good. Lu Ming killed young master Yi Xiang of the winged men tribe. Let’s see how the Wu family can protect him. Send a message to the family head and report this matter!</p><p>An old man of the winged man race roared.</p><p>young master Jin Yuan has been killed. Send a message to the family head!</p><p>An expert of the Jin family also said.</p><p>Then, the experts of the Qin family also sent a message to the head of the Qin family.</p><p>The woo family experts ‘expressions changed. This matter was out of their control. They could only pass the news to the Wu family’s head.</p><p>All parties transmitted their voices and then confronted each other.</p><p>“Patriarchs, are you coming?”</p><p>&Nbsp; the surrounding spectators were all flabbergasted. They didn’t think that things would develop to this point.</p><p>They continued to retreat and put some distance between them to avoid being affected.</p><p>Time passed by, second by second.</p><p>Suddenly, a heavy aura came from the West. Many people found it hard to breathe when this aura swept by.</p><p>Before anyone could react, a terrifying pressure came from that direction, covering the sky and earth.</p><p>It was like an ant facing a tsunami that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The pressure grew stronger and stronger. Some of the weaker cultivators couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Everyone looked in that direction in fear. It seemed like a terrifying giant beast was flying over.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!”</p><p>Someone suppressed his fear and muttered.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a middle-aged man from the winged man Tribe walking over.</p><p>This person seemed to be walking very slowly, one step at a time. However, with every step, an endless distance flashed under his feet. In a few breaths, this person appeared in the sky.</p><p>That incomparably terrifying pressure was emitted from this person’s body.</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the patriarch!”</p><p>The winged man expert quickly saluted the middle-aged man.</p><p>Many people were shocked. This man was the patriarch of the winged men’s family.</p><p>The winged man race family was a powerful family in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, with an incomparably long history.</p><p>The family head of the winged man race was definitely an Overlord of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. His strength was unfathomable. Such a person had personally come today.</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan swept his gaze across the scene. His eyes were extremely cold as he said,”Yi Xiang was killed?”</p><p>Although his voice was calm, anyone could hear the terrifying killing intent in it.</p><p>“Y-yes!”</p><p>An old man of the winged man race answered in fear.</p><p>“Who killed him?”</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan asked.</p><p>“He’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>The winged man elder pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“A bunch of trash!”</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan berated. The winged man experts lowered their heads, not even daring to breathe loudly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
