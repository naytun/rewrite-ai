With a flash, he charged toward the sect leader of the immortal sword sect.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The sect leader of the indestructible sword sect’s expression changed drastically. He retreated quickly, not daring to clash with Lu Ming head-on.</p><p>However, under the suppression of the king’s Pagoda, his strength was greatly reduced, just like the Dean of the wing demon Academy. Even his speed was much slower.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming was not affected at all. In the blink of an eye, he closed in on the sect master of the eternal sword sect. The lightning Spear condensed once again and he thrust it at the sect master.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>die! the sect master of the indestructible sword sect roared and slashed out with all his might.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>.com</p><p>The lightning Spear clashed with the sect leader’s sword radiance, creating a deafening boom. Countless tiny lightning bolts and sword Qi shot out in all directions.</p><p>Then, the sect master’s sword-light trembled violently and exploded with a boom.</p><p>The lightning Spear did not stop and continued to stab toward the sect master of the eternal sword sect.</p><p>The inextinguishable Sword Master roared and used all his remaining power to Dodge to the side.</p><p>However, he was still a step too slow. Half of his body was hit and exploded.</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect was severely injured. He retreated frantically in an attempt to escape.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him escape?</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch. Seven bolts of lightning as thick as a human’s waist shot toward the sect master of the eternal sword sect, shrouding him in an instant.</p><p>“I’m not willing to accept this!”</p><p>The sect leader of the indestructible sword sect howled and turned into dust in the lightning.</p><p>Yet another Overlord-level character had been killed.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Scarlet Flame tribe and the boundless sacred land’s Saint Lord were so scared that they almost peed their pants.</p><p>The two of them fled in two different directions.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and immediately chased after the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>He’d rather let the boundless sacred land’s Saint Lord go than the Scarlet Flame tribe’s patriarch.</p><p>The king-suppressing Pagoda shrouded the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame tribe and followed him like a shadow. He could not escape at all and Lu Ming caught up with him very quickly.</p><p>The boundless sacred land’s Saint Lord had escaped the king-suppressing Pagoda’s range.</p><p>“Boundless sacred land, follow me! Retreat!”</p><p>The boundless Saint Lord roared. He had escaped with great difficulty and no longer dared to oppose Lu Ming. He called the people of the boundless Saint land and flew out of the Galaxy, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go too!”</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>The people of the winged demon Academy and the immortal sword sect had no intention of staying here after seeing their college chief and sect master killed. They were all fleeing.</p><p>“Don’t let them escape, kill them!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was a decisive person. He would not miss this opportunity. He roared and charged toward the two sects.</p><p>The boundless Holy Land had escaped. As for the winged demon Academy and the immortal sword sect, many of their experts had been killed by Lu Ming previously. In particular, the few remaining third level Divine King realm existences were all killed by Lu Ming. No one could stop the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The other Masters of the ice Soul Clan attacked the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>A chaotic battle began.</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan was unrivaled. In just a few moves, he had killed a few divine kings from the indestructible sword sect and the winged demon Academy.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming had caught up with the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>“Forefather, save me!”</p><p>The patriarch of the red flame clan shouted in horror. He wanted to ask the patriarch of the red flame clan to save him, but the patriarch of the red flame clan could not leave because the patriarch of the ice Soul Clan was attacking him desperately. The two patriarchs were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>After Lu Ming caught up with the clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan, he launched a fierce attack.</p><p>The clan leader of the Scarlet Flame clan had also broken through to the next level by taking the king breakthrough pill. He was about the same level as the Dean of the winged demon Academy and the sect leader of the immortal sword sect. He could not withstand Lu Ming’s attack at all.</p><p>After two moves, he was also killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the storage ring of the Scarlet Flame clan leader and charged towards the Scarlet Flame clan’s forefather.</p><p>The forefather of the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan were fighting fiercely. Seeing Lu Ming coming, the forefather of the Scarlet Flame clan was almost scared to death. He tried his best to escape.</p><p>However, the ice Soul clan’s ancestor knew that this was the best time to kill the Scarlet Flame clan’s ancestor. How could he let him leave?</p><p>The elder from the ice Soul Clan risked his injuries to hold the Scarlet Flame clan’s ancestor back. He set up countless ice mountains in the void to stop the Scarlet Flame clan’s ancestor.</p><p>Those who cultivated ice-attribute divine power were more effective in blocking.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost!”</p><p>The Scarlet Flame tribe’s old ancestor continued to roar. His body was like a star as he launched a crazy attack, trying to break through the encirclement and escape.</p><p>One by one, the ice mountains exploded, but immediately, more ice mountains formed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Just then, Lu Ming arrived. The king’s Pagoda emitted a bright light that enveloped the Scarlet Flame tribe’s patriarch.</p><p>The aura of the Scarlet Flame race’s old ancestor suddenly weakened and his star core was greatly suppressed.</p><p>However, the ice Soul clan’s patriarch was completely fine.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch would not miss this opportunity. He formed an icy sword and slashed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Half of the Scarlet Flame tribe’s old ancestor’s body was severely injured.</p><p>There was no need for Lu Ming to do anything. The strength of the Scarlet Flame clan’s patriarch and the ice Soul clan’s patriarch was equal. Now that he was suppressed by the king suppression tower, the Scarlet Flame clan’s patriarch was much weaker. He was no match for the ice Soul clan’s patriarch at all.</p><p>He was severely injured by one move and was even more vulnerable. After barely blocking a few moves, he was killed by the ice Soul clan’s ancestor.</p><p>At this point, the boundless Holy Land had escaped. The top experts of the Scarlet Flame tribe, the immortal sword sect, and the winged demon Academy had all fallen.</p><p>As for the other top-tier sects, they had long fled. Lu Ming and the rest could not be bothered to care about them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, my young friend, thank you!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch cupped his fists and thanked Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior, you’re welcome. Let’s deal with the immortal sword sect and the winged demon Academy first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s patriarch nodded and charged into the Scarlet Flame clan.</p><p>Although there were still some experts in the red flame clan who had fought with the ice Soul Clan, the battle was completely one-sided with the addition of the old man from the ice Soul Clan.</p><p>The experts of the red flame clan were killed by the ice Soul clan’s patriarch one after another.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he controlled the king’s Pagoda and charged towards the immortal sword sect and the winged demon Academy.</p><p>There were not many experts from the indestructible sword sect and the winged demon Academy left. Some of them had been killed by the clan leader of the ice Soul Clan, so there were even fewer left.</p><p>There was almost no suspense in this battle.</p><p>Not long after, the experts of the major forces were almost all killed, especially those above the divine King realm. They were all killed, leaving only a few who could escape.</p><p>However, some heavenly gods managed to escape, but the top experts of these forces were all slaughtered. They could be considered to exist in name only.</p><p>Very soon, it would be occupied by other forces. From then on, the situation of the Qin heaven star region would undergo a shocking change.</p><p>Not long after, the area finally quieted down.</p><p>The battle came to an end.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
