Looks like I guessed right.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was cold. This old fellow was boasting about how awesome the life soul vitality stone was and seducing Lu Ming. He did not have any good intentions. He wanted to use Lu Ming to integrate with other Rock Spirits.</p><p>No wonder he did not tell Lu Ming that he was a rock spirit and not an array spirit.</p><p>Lu Ming even suspected that a complete life soul vitality stone was not as impressive as the rock spirit had said. It could help him become the Overlord of the universe. It must be a lie!</p><p>little guy, don’t look at me like that. The more Rock Spirits I merge with, the stronger I will be. The stronger I am, the stronger my life soul and vitality stones will be, and the more benefits it will bring you. I’m doing this for your own good!</p><p>The rock spirit said shamelessly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not really believe this old man. He felt that he had really fallen into a trap.</p><p>“Old man, since you’re a rock spirit, and your life spirit, primordial stone fragment, has recognized me as its master, it means that you’ve recognized me as your master. Is it appropriate for you to call me ‘little fellow’ and ‘little fellow’ now?”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the rock spirit with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>The rock spirit revealed an embarrassed expression, and smiled brightly.”It’s just a form of address. Why take it so seriously? look at me. I’m already so old. It’s not bad to call you ‘little guy’. Why don’t I call you Lu Ming?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was still sullen. He stared at the rock spirit and did not say a word.</p><p>The rock spirit felt guilty. Okay, okay, okay. Master, I’ll call you master, okay?!</p><p>Shi Lingxin said unwillingly.</p><p>“This is more like it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mood was finally a little better. Anyway, he felt that the old rock spirit was very unreliable. He could not be bothered to be polite with it.</p><p>“You can go in, I’m leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The rock spirit nodded and turned into a ray of light, burrowing into the life soul and vitality stone fragment. Lu Ming then kept the life soul and vitality stone fragment in his sea of consciousness and walked towards the altar, channeling his divine power into it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When the divine power was injected into the altar, runes appeared on the altar. Then, runes appeared on the entire platform.</p><p>The rock spirit was right. This platform was a teleportation formation.</p><p>Runes filled the air, and a door of light appeared. Lu Ming stepped into it, and in the next moment, he found himself on a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the surroundings and realized that he had already appeared outside the castle. He was about tens of thousands of miles away from the castle.</p><p>it seems like there aren’t any treasures in this entire Castle. There’s only a piece of life soul and origin stone fragment left …</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled a few words and then rose into the sky, turning into a rainbow light and leaving the place.</p><p>Inside the castle, many geniuses were still exploring. However, Jin Yuan, Xu Yan, and the others continued to explore. After realizing that they didn’t find anything, they all left.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way. After flying for hundreds of thousands of miles, he found a place to land.</p><p>“It’s been a few months since I entered the castle. I wonder if Wu Ming and the others have any news of Qiu Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered deeply. Then, he took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a message to Qiu Yue. However, he realized that he still could not send a message. Next, he sent another message to Wu Ming.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Wu Ming replied not long after.</p><p>According to the news, they already had a lead on Qiu Yue.</p><p>Seeing this, Lu Ming was ecstatic. He set a meeting place with Wu Ming and the rest and hurriedly rushed over.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming met Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>“Brothers woo, you said you have news of Qiu Yue, is that true?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not wait to ask when he saw Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>it’s true. We’ve been asking around and finally found something. It’s said that someone saw lady Qiuyue’s tracks at the thousand Moon Lake!</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>“Thousand Moon Lake? What time period?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He knew about the thousand Moon Lake as it was recorded on the map that Wu zixiong had given him. It was a huge Lake and was extremely mysterious.</p><p>“This … I’ve heard that I saw them when I first entered star-moon ancient city, but they’ve disappeared without a trace.”</p><p>Wu Ming said with a frown.</p><p>“Did you see them when you first entered star-moon ancient city?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly. He had a bad feeling.</p><p>Qiu Yue had appeared in the beginning and disappeared without a trace. Even her voice transmission jade talisman could not be sent out. What was going on? Could something have really happened?</p><p>“Brother Lu, don’t worry. I believe that lady Qiuyue will be fine!”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest consoled Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you, brother woo. I’ll take my leave now!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, why don’t we go with you?”</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>“No need, I’m going to make a trip to the thousand Moon Lake. Next, I’ll have to trouble you to help me find out about Qiu Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Of course, don’t worry, brother Lu!”</p><p>Wu Ming and the others nodded.</p><p>They also knew that Lu Ming was much more powerful than them. If they followed Lu Ming and encountered danger, not only would they not be of any help, they might even be a burden to him.</p><p>It was better for Lu Ming to act alone.</p><p>Lu Ming bade farewell to Wu Ming and the rest. He headed to the thousand Moon Lake alone.</p><p>The thousand Moon Lake was to the West of Lu Ming’s location. It took him more than a day to reach the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>A boundless Lake appeared in front of him.</p><p>This Lake was extremely mysterious. On the surface of the lake, there seemed to be countless shadows of the moon. It was extremely bright, so it was called the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Loud rumbling sounds could be heard from far away.</p><p>Lu Ming flew towards the center of the thousand Moon Lake. Not long after, Lu Ming discovered that there was a huge Whirlpool in the middle of the lake. The loud rumbling sounds were coming from this Whirlpool.</p><p>The whirlpool was huge and had a radius of at least a few thousand miles. The endless lake water was sucked into the whirlpool, but the strange thing was that the water of thousand Moon Lake didn’t decrease at all.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He saw a figure on the other side of the vortex.</p><p>One of them was a young man who was a winged man. He had a pair of green wings on his back, and on the wings, there were wisps of lightning swimming.</p><p>These were the lightning winged ones of the winged ones.</p><p>The winged ones were an extremely large race in the primeval universe. They were divided into many different branch races and were extremely powerful.</p><p>The lightning winged race was only one branch of the wings race.</p><p>Lu Ming remembered that there was an ancient family in the nine ultimate Heavenly King mansion, and all of them were lightning winged ones.</p><p>The other party looked at Lu Ming and his eyes flickered. He had obviously recognized Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and cupped his fists. brother, I’d like to ask you about something. Have you seen this woman before? ”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming took out a jade talisman. The Jade talisman glowed and Qiu Yue’s image appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s portrait was sealed in the Jade talisman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
