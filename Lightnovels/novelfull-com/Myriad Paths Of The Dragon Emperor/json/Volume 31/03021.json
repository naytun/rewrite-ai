The ice chains shook violently, but they managed to block it and did not shatter.</p><p>Even so, there was still a terrifying force surging toward Lu Ming, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming took a few steps back, he took a step forward and soared into the sky. Then, he looked down from above and waved his spear.</p><p>Space-breaking, space-breaking …</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming executed more than a dozen moves of ‘space-piercing’. More than a dozen spear lights fell like stars and blasted toward Qin Wukong.</p><p>Qin Wukong was helpless. He could only continue to punch.</p><p>However, even though the seven injury divine fist would be more powerful after being injured, it also had a drawback, which was that it would add injuries to the injuries.</p><p>If he couldn’t finish off his opponent in a short time, his injuries would only get worse.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming and Qin Wukong continued to fight and exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>It had to be said that Qin Wukong was a terrifying opponent. He was extremely talented. No matter if it was divine skills, secret Arts, or divine power, he was not weak. If his divine power was completely awakened and he awakened the origin factor of divine power, he would definitely be able to pass through the heaven Gate.</p><p>Moreover, the more injured he was, the more powerful the seven injuries divine fist would be. Lu Ming had almost used all his means, but he could not take down Qin Wushang in a short time.</p><p>However, after such a long battle, Qin Wushang’s injuries were getting more and more serious, and the power of the seven injury fist was starting to weaken.</p><p>The seven injury fist couldn’t defy the heavens. When the injury reached a certain level, the power wouldn’t increase, but would weaken instead.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>After exchanging another blow with Lu Ming, Qin Wukong’s body trembled and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His face was extremely pale.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Qin Wukong let out a furious roar. He gritted his teeth and his body suddenly retreated. In an instant, he had retreated out of the range of the stone platform.</p><p>He directly admitted defeat.</p><p>“Why don’t you dare to fight? Didn’t you want to kill me? We haven’t even fought to the death and you’re already leaving?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard.</p><p>Qin Wukong gritted his teeth. His eyes were filled with crazy killing intent. However, he did not speak. He took out a healing pill and swallowed it. He focused on healing his injuries.</p><p>“Qin Wukong was actually defeated!”</p><p>Many people murmured. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they would have found it hard to believe.</p><p>Qin Wukong was actually defeated at the hands of a fifth level heavenly deity.</p><p>Qin Wukong was definitely a top existence below the Godking level. Other than the few geniuses who had awakened the origin divine power, he was almost an invincible figure.</p><p>Such a character was actually defeated at the hands of a fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>“This Lu Ming is so scary!”</p><p>he’s indeed terrifying. If it wasn’t for the fact that his cultivation base is slightly weaker, if his cultivation base were to increase and reach the half-step Divine King realm … No, as long as he’s at the ninth level of the celestial deity realm, I’m afraid no one below the divine King realm would be his match!</p><p>Many people exclaimed.</p><p>The expressions of Jin Xing, Qin Wukong, and the others turned even uglier.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>On the stone platform, Lu Ming swept a glance at Qin Wukong and the others before turning around. However, he did not sit down. His gaze was fixed on the three stone platforms in the first row.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming wanted to challenge the people in the first row?</p><p>“With his strength, he might really succeed!”</p><p>Someone spoke, and many people nodded.</p><p>Indeed, among the three people in the first row, other than the heaven’s favorite who had awakened the primordial divine power factor, the other two might not be as strong as Qin Wukong.</p><p>If Lu Ming could defeat Qin Wukong, he might be able to defeat the other two and secure a position.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they anticipated another peak battle.</p><p>Lu Ming indeed wanted to challenge the people in the first row.</p><p>He could only cultivate for three years here. Lu Ming had been cultivating for nine months. Time was precious. Of course, Lu Ming would use the remaining time to cultivate in the most effective position.</p><p>Lu Ming swallowed a few divine pills and refined the medicinal effects to recover.</p><p>This wait lasted for five days.</p><p>At this moment, a young man in the first row began to glow.</p><p>“It’s him, Xu Yan!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. The person suffused with light was the genius who had awakened the origin divine power factor. His name was Xu Yan.</p><p>“Lu Ming will definitely not challenge Xu Yan!”</p><p>Many people shook their heads.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming had no intention of challenging Xu Yan. With his current abilities, he was no match for him.</p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes and stood up, frowning. “What a pity!”</p><p>With a low sigh, Xu Yan actually stepped out and directly left the stone platform. He turned into a rainbow light and disappeared into the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Xu Yan has left?”</p><p>it seems that he has been cultivating here for three years. The three-year period is up. There is no point in staying here!</p><p>looking at his expression, his divine power shouldn’t have awakened for the second time!</p><p>of course. How can the second awakening of Shen power be so easy? every time Shen power awakens, the difficulty is ten times harder than the previous one. Anyone below the God King level who can awaken it for the first time is already a genius among geniuses. A second awakening is simply impossible!</p><p>After seeing Xu Yan leave, many people began to discuss.</p><p>“He’s actually gone. That saves me a lot of trouble!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took a step forward and appeared on the stone platform that Xu Yan was on earlier.</p><p>“Lu Ming has indeed gone up!”</p><p>Many people shook their heads.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped onto the stone platform in the first row. No one dared to challenge him.</p><p>What a joke. Even Qin Wukong had been defeated. If he went up without awakening the origin divine power factor, wouldn’t he be asking for humiliation?</p><p>There were quite a number of people who were competing for Lu Ming’s position. After a round of fighting, the stone platform was occupied by one person.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, no one challenged him.</p><p>After a day, a light screen enveloped Lu Ming. He sat cross-legged and entered a state of cultivation.</p><p>It was still the same starry sky, and the original gods were still fighting. However, the feeling was much clearer.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming found the origin divine energy of the ruler’s divine power and began to study it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A streak of original divine power of a ruler’s divine power flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>At first, Lu Ming was unconcerned. However, the next moment, his expression changed.</p><p>This was because when this strand of divine power flew over, it actually scattered into dozens of strands. Then, each strand of divine power actually turned into a figure and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The cold killing intent, the ear-piercing energy, everything was so real.</p><p>Lu Ming instinctively blocked it.</p><p>The nine ice chains flew out and blocked in front of him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The origin divine power of the ruler’s divine power transformed into dozens of figures and attacked the ice chains. The ice chains trembled continuously. Lu Ming felt as if he had been hit by a planet. His body was thrown back, his qi and blood boiling, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>it’s true. It’s true. It has offensive power …</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned solemn.</p><p>This attack was not an illusion, but real.</p><p>“Then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was strong. He wanted to use his ancient God Body, but he realized that he could not.</p><p>It was useless to trigger the battle formula.</p><p>it seems like I can only rely on divine power and divine skills to resist!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He condensed a long spear in his hand and charged forward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
