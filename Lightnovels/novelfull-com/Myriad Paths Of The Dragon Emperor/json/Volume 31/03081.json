He hurriedly circulated his cultivation to resist, but he could not even exert half of his strength. In the end, he could only let out a blood-curdling scream before he was blasted apart by Lu Ming’s spear radiance.</p><p>Jin Yuan had fallen!</p><p>The other people in the restaurant gasped in shock.</p><p>Something big happened!</p><p>They knew that something big had happened today.</p><p>A few godkings of the Jin clan had been killed in succession. Now, even one of the four heroes of the Jin clan, Jin Yuan, had been killed. If the Jin clan knew about this, they would probably go crazy.</p><p>At the same time, he was shocked by Lu Ming’s power. He had just killed a first level Divine King realm expert from the Jin clan and now he had even killed a second level Divine King realm expert.</p><p>“A metallic lifeform. That’s a metallic lifeform!”</p><p>.com</p><p>“No wonder I didn’t sense any aura before!”</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>At this moment, the second Sky of Godking realm expert of the winged man race charged out of the restaurant with Yi Xiang. He flew out of the window.</p><p>Lu Ming had just killed the Jin clan’s experts and Jin Yuan. Yi Xiang was already scared out of his wits. The second level Divine King expert did not dare to stay at all. He took Yi Xiang and fled.</p><p>They had miscalculated. They knew that they had miscalculated. They did not expect that Lu Ming had a terrifying metallic lifeform.</p><p>“You want to escape? stay here today!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He brought QiuQiu and dashed out of the window in a flash.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he rushed out of the window, Lu Ming fired a shot.</p><p>A huge spear light, like a vast and boundless mountain range, pressed towards Yi Xiang and the winged man race expert.</p><p>The air current in the void was driven, making a violent sound, which alarmed the people nearby.</p><p>Everyone nearby stopped to watch.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The expert of the winged men tribe flapped his wings and a sharp ray of light slashed into the sky, destroying Lu Ming’s spear light.</p><p>However, his speed was also slowed down.</p><p>QiuQiu seized the opportunity and flew out, instantly catching up with soaring wing and the other two.</p><p>“Young master, you go first!”</p><p>The expert of the winged men race roared and suddenly turned around. His pair of wings rapidly enlarged, suffused with endless lightning. Then, the endless lightning struck toward QiuQiu’s face.</p><p>However, lightning was completely ineffective against QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu itself carried a type of terrifying lightning with boundless might. Thus, when these lightning bolts struck QiuQiu’s body, they were immediately absorbed by it.</p><p>QiuQiu wasn’t hindered at all. Its figure rushed past, and then it slashed at the winged man expert with its saber.</p><p>This person also didn’t expect that the lightning had no effect on QiuQiu at all, and he was a little caught off guard.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>QiuQiu’s saber slashed down, and this person was cut in half.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Yi Xiang was so frightened that he kept screaming.</p><p>“It’s your turn!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and charged towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a few angry roars came from all directions. Then, a few terrifying auras filled the air and filled the air towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled violently under the pressure of these auras. It was as if a few divine mountains were pressing down on him, almost making him vomit blood.</p><p>Then, a few figures rushed over at a terrifying speed. In a flash, they were beside Yi Xiang.</p><p>There were a total of three people, three burly men!</p><p>One was wearing a golden robe, one had a pair of Lightning Wings on his back, and one had a scale between his eyebrows.</p><p>One was from the Jin clan, one was from the winged man race, and the last one was from the Qin clan.</p><p>The three of them had been standing guard at the edge of the tower in the clouds. However, Lu Ming had just charged out and QiuQiu had killed the winged men tribe’s expert. It had happened so quickly that these experts did not even have the time to react.</p><p>They only reacted after the winged man expert was killed. They rushed over and protected Yi Xiang in the middle.</p><p>“Third level of King God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>The three of them were third level Divine King realm experts. Their strength was simply astonishing.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s abilities, he would most likely be killed in one move if he were to go up against a third-tier Divine King.</p><p>hahaha, they’ve arrived! They’ve finally arrived!</p><p>Yi Xiang heaved a sigh of relief, then laughed madly in his heart, his eyes filled with malevolence.</p><p>kill! Kill this kid! He killed Jin Yuan! He killed Jin Yuan!</p><p>Yi Xiang screamed.</p><p>“What? He killed Jin Yuan? You should die!”</p><p>The burly man from the Jin clan let out a furious roar when he heard the news. His body erupted with a volcano-like aura. His anger soared to the sky, and his killing intent was extremely cold.</p><p>His body trembled slightly due to his anger. He glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>They had miscalculated. They had miscalculated.</p><p>They had been standing guard near the tower in the clouds and had watched Lu Ming enter the tower.</p><p>They saw that Lu Ming had entered the tower in the clouds alone. Therefore, they did not follow him.</p><p>In the tower amongst the clouds, there were quite a few second and first level divine kings. Dealing with Lu Ming would be a piece of cake.</p><p>If there were experts who followed Lu Ming in, they would definitely have to enter the tower in the clouds as well.</p><p>They did not expect that Lu Ming would have a metallic lifeform with him.</p><p>The metallic lifeform was very peculiar. When Lu Ming wore it, it was like a piece of jewelry. One could only sense that something was amiss if they sensed it carefully.</p><p>Therefore, they knew that they had made a mistake and had wasted gold ingot.</p><p>“Brat, I’m going to grind your bones and scatter your ashes!”</p><p>The third level Divine King realm expert from the Jin clan bellowed. His violent aura locked onto Lu Ming. Lu Ming felt as if a mountain was pressing down on him, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Ball ball …”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu. QiuQiu flew back to Lu Ming’s side and transformed back into a bangle, which Lu Ming wore on his wrist. With the help of QiuQiu’s strength, Lu Ming’s arm shook and broke through the other party’s aura suppression.</p><p>However, at the next moment, the Jin clan’s expert took a step forward and rushed toward Lu Ming like a golden rainbow. His palm turned golden and he slapped toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A violent explosion sounded in the air, and the terrifying force was like a tsunami.</p><p>The third level of the Godking realm had an astonishing amount of divine power, far exceeding that of the second level.</p><p>“QiuQiu, I’m counting on you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to QiuQiu.</p><p>“Don’t worry. He’s just a third level Divine King. Leave him to me!”</p><p>QiuQiu’s voice was heard. Then, its body squirmed and wrapped around Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>Lu Ming kept his long spear and threw a punch.</p><p>‘Squeak …’</p><p>After Lu Ming’s punch, bolts of lightning spread out from QiuQiu’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist collided with the palm print of the Jin clan’s third level Divine King realm expert. An earth-shattering boom erupted, and a terrifying wave almost sent the tower in the clouds flying.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>QiuQiu’s body was suffused with lightning. This kind of lightning came from the bronze of the ancient God World. It was ancient and powerful, and its power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The lightning flashed and destroyed the palm print of the Jin clan’s expert. Then, the lightning continued to attack the Jin clan’s expert.</p><p>The third level Godking realm expert from the Jin clan was struck by a bolt of lightning. His body trembled and he was forced to retreat. His body was numbed and he almost vomited blood.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
