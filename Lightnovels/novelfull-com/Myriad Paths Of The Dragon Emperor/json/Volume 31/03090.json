The nine-clawed Divine Dragon, on the other hand, was completely unharmed.</p><p>“You … Your cultivation? How is that possible?”</p><p>The elementalist widened his eyes and exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>This result was completely different from what he had imagined.</p><p>In his imagination, this move would be enough to crush Lu Ming and crush him into pieces.</p><p>However, the result was that his move was easily broken by Lu Ming. Lu Ming’s body was emitting an aura that made him feel fear.</p><p>He found it hard to believe that Lu Ming’s ability had reached such a level in such a short period of time.</p><p>“What’s wrong? With just this bit of strength, it’s my turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his voice full of murderous intent.</p><p>.com</p><p>In his opinion, the strength of an Elementalist was too weak to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Although an Elementalist had reached the level of a half-step Divine King, the divine energy he controlled was very ordinary. It was only King-grade divine energy. His ability was far inferior to the half-step Divine King of the universal camp, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run, run!”</p><p>At this moment, there was only one word in the elementalist’s mind, and that was ‘escape’.</p><p>His figure retreated rapidly and rushed in another direction.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared in front of him, blocking his way.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The elementalist screamed in fear, his old face contorted in a grimace.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please spare me!”</p><p>The elementalist begged for mercy.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s reply was filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A nine-clawed Divine Dragon roared and pounced on the elementalist. It grabbed the elementalist with its claws and tore him apart with all its might, killing him.</p><p>Back then, he was an Elementalist. If he had not appeared on his own accord, Lu Ming would have almost forgotten about him. However, he had jumped out to court death, which was exactly what Lu Ming wanted.</p><p>After killing the elementalist, Lu Ming felt more at ease and continued to fly towards Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Not long after, he saw a few rainbow lights rapidly flying towards him from planet Kong Xuan.</p><p>“It’s them!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>A few old men had come, and one of them was Yuexin’s father, Yue Wu Ya.</p><p>The other two were also elders of the Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Obviously, they had sensed the battle just now, so they had rushed over.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>“I pay my respects to Holy Son Lu Ming!”</p><p>When Yue Wuya and the rest saw Lu Ming, they were slightly taken aback and quickly saluted him in surprise.</p><p>“Elders, how have you been?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“Holy Son Lu Ming, we sensed the fluctuations of a great battle ahead. Did you notice anything?”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said.</p><p>“That was an Elementalist. He wanted to kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Elementalist!”</p><p>The expressions of Yue Wu Ya and the others changed, ” “Holy Son, are you alright? Where are the elementalists?”</p><p>Although they saw that Lu Ming was fine, they still looked worried.</p><p>Elementalists were inner sect elders of Kong Xuan sect back then, existences at the peak of the heavenly God stage.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ve already killed the elementalist!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“What? Kill … Kill them?”</p><p>Yue Wuya and the rest were stunned. Then, they glanced around Lu Ming to see if he had any helpers.</p><p>They could not believe that the elementalist was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>let’s go back to the Kong Xuan sect. I have something to tell you!</p><p>Lu Ming said. With that, he flew toward Kong Xuan sect.</p><p>Yue Wu Ya and the others could only suppress the doubts in their hearts.</p><p>most likely, there are other experts following the Saint, but they are unwilling to show themselves!</p><p>A thought flashed through the minds of Yue Wuya and the others. They still did not believe that Lu Ming could kill an Elementalist.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and the rest returned to the Kong Xuan sect and immediately gathered the senior management of the sect.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was only a Saint of the Kong Xuan sect, his influence was comparable to that of the sect leader. This was because everyone knew that Lu Ming had the terrifying Dark Dragon behind him.</p><p>After the higher-ups of Kong Xuan sect gathered, Lu Ming told them about the nine absolute divine crystal.</p><p>“What? The nine absolute divine crystal was stolen by the dark ice Clan!”</p><p>“Detestable dark ice Race. The Qin heaven Starfield was almost destroyed.”</p><p>After everyone heard Lu Ming’s words, they started to discuss.</p><p>everyone, I’ve returned this time to annihilate the dark ice Clan, take back the nine absolute divine crystal, and ensure the safety of the Qin heaven star system. Therefore, I need the cooperation of the entire Kong Xuan sect!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t worry, Saint. The Kong Xuan sect will do its best!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya was the first to speak.</p><p>“We will definitely cooperate fully!”</p><p>The other elders also chimed in.</p><p>As for Ouyang Qingxiang and the others, they naturally did not object.</p><p>well, that’s good. You can start gathering people during this time! Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Holy Son Lu Ming, the dark ice Clan was once a large clan that competed with the ice Soul Clan for hegemony. They’re extremely powerful. I’m afraid that the Kong Xuan sect alone is no match for them!</p><p>Yue Wu Ya said.</p><p>don’t worry. I’ll visit the ice Soul Clan later. I believe they’ll be more than willing to cooperate!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s good!”</p><p>Yue Wu Ya and the others nodded.</p><p>After that, the doyens left one after another and began to make preparations.</p><p>After leaving this place, he headed to a place in the Kong Xuan sect, which was the dark Dragon secret realm.</p><p>The bone Devil had taken over you Long’s body and had been cultivating in the dark Dragon secret realm to recover his strength. It was unknown how much strength you long had recovered after so long.</p><p>This time, he might need the help of the bone Devil.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the dark Dragon secret realm and flew toward the place where the bone demon was in seclusion.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw a gargantuan Dark Dragon lying on the ground. It was like a mountain range, and its body was emitting a dark light.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re here!”</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming arrived, you Long’s huge body moved and its huge eyes looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Senior bone demon, how’s your recovery of this Dark Dragon’s strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Hehe, feel it!”</p><p>Bone demon chuckled, and then a powerful Dragon’s might spread out from you long.</p><p>This Dragon might was so powerful that it shook the heavens and earth. The entire Dark Dragon secret realm started to shake violently.</p><p>Terrifying, extremely terrifying. Lu Ming felt like he was facing the Masters of the Jin family and the winged man family, who were at the peak of the divine King realm.</p><p>“This … This is the peak of God King?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice trembled.</p><p>Aiyo, kid, you’re quite knowledgeable. Not bad, I’ve already restored the dark Dragon’s divine power to the peak of the God King realm!</p><p>Bone demon chuckled, his face full of pride.</p><p>“Amazing, amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>Lu Ming had never expected that the bone demon had already recovered you Long’s strength to the peak of the divine King realm. With such strength, not to mention the Qin heaven Galaxy, even in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, he would be an Overlord. He was a character who could do whatever he wanted.</p><p>If existences above the God King stage did not appear, this was invincible.</p><p>it’s a pity that this Dark Dragon has been suppressed for so many years. It has used up a lot of its source energy. Even if I use all my means, I can only recover to this level at most. Could it be that I’ve transcended the Godking level? ”</p><p>Bone sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
