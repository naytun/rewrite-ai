I do</p><p>The nine ice chains wrapped around Jin Jue, exuding a shocking coldness.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>break! Jin Jue shouted as he slashed at the ice chains with his void-breaking sword, trying to break them.</p><p>However, a series of metal clanging sounds rang out and sparks flew in all directions. The ice chains were completely undamaged, but they were sent flying by the powerful force.</p><p>However, after the ice chain flew out, it turned and continued to attack Jin Jue.</p><p>“So tough? how is this possible?”</p><p>Jin Jue’s expression changed drastically, and he was in disbelief.</p><p>The ice chains were only condensed by Lu Ming using a secret skill and were not any divine weapon. He had not expected that the void-splitting sword could not cut it.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming himself had also charged forward. He swung his long spear down and a crescent-shaped spear radiance slashed down at Jin Jue.</p><p>Jin Jue hurriedly blocked. Although he blocked Lu Ming’s attack, the ice chains came at him again.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He waved his sword and continuously slashed at the ice chains, shaking them away.</p><p>However, the shocking chill of the ice chains crawled up Jin Jue’s body through his sword.</p><p>The ninth ice chain, in particular, had an even more astonishing chill. Under the stimulation of the divine power of the moon, its power became more and more terrifying.</p><p>The layer of golden light on Jin Jue’s body was covered in a layer of frost.</p><p>His movements also became stiff, and his strength was greatly affected.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and seized the opportunity to launch a storm of attacks, beginning to suppress Jin Jue in all aspects.</p><p>In fact, if Lu Ming went all out, he could easily crush Jin Jue. However, Lu Ming felt that there might be a big battle later on, so it was better to keep some trump cards.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few more moves, Jin Jue was swept by Lu Ming’s spear gleam. The protective divine power that covered his body shattered, and his body flew out horizontally, spitting out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Damn it, brat, I’ll settle this score another day!”</p><p>Jin Jue roared and was about to rush out of the stone platform.</p><p>“Another day? You still want another day? You’re really naive!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. The nine ice chains grew longer rapidly and danced in the sky like an inescapable net, blocking Jin Jue’s retreat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Jin Jue’s attack landed on the ice chain, but the ice chain only trembled. Jin Jue’s body was blocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you want to do? Don’t tell me you want to kill me? do you dare?”</p><p>Jin Jue roared.</p><p>He was a top-notch heaven’s pride expert of the Jin clan. The Jin clan was one of the top aristocratic families in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. Lu Ming, a mere piece of trash from the Qin heaven Starfield, dared to kill him?</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply was a cold sneer. Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and the Spear’s gleam was as heavy as a mountain, pressing down on Jin Jue.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With one side losing and the other gaining, Jin Jue was even less of a match for Lu Ming. He was sent flying by one move and crashed into the ice chains. He was severely injured and kept spitting out blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The ice chains seized the opportunity to bind Jin Jue.</p><p>ah, ah, let me go. Lu Ming, I order you to let me go!</p><p>Jin Jue roared.</p><p>“Order me? You’re just a prisoner, and you’re ordering me around? are you out of your mind?”</p><p>Lu Ming was so angry that he laughed. He waved the ice chain and smashed Jin Xing to the ground.</p><p>Instantly, Jin Jue was smashed into a dead dog.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’d better let him go. Otherwise, the Jin family will not let you off. You should know the power of the Jin family in the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>Outside the arena, Jin Xing shouted and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, let me go! I don’t believe you dare to kill me!”</p><p>Jin Jue also roared. At this point, he still did not believe that Lu Ming would dare to kill him, especially in front of so many people.</p><p>“What an idiot, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. Then, an icy cold killing intent filled the air.</p><p>Enveloped by this killing intent, Jin Jue shivered. At this moment, he felt a chill in his heart and his eyes revealed fear.</p><p>He had a feeling that Lu Ming would really kill him. Lu Ming really dared to!</p><p>“No, don’t …”</p><p>Jin Jue shouted in fear. He was finally scared.</p><p>“You don’t want it? I want it. ”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said calmly. He thrust his spear forward and pierced through the space between Jin Jue’s eyebrows.</p><p>Jin Jue twitched and stopped breathing. He was killed by Lu Ming on the spot.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Outside the arena, Jin Xing roared with anger.</p><p>He did not expect that Lu Ming would dare to kill the top talent of the Jin family. Was he not afraid of the Jin family’s revenge?</p><p>“I’ll kill whoever wants to kill me, who cares who they are!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>He had experienced so much along the way that he had long understood one thing.</p><p>When dealing with enemies, one must be ruthless. If there was a chance to kill, one must kill.</p><p>Because your enemy will not stop just because you let him go. On the contrary, they will take revenge even more.</p><p>Even if he didn’t kill Jin Jue, the Jin clan wouldn’t let him go. Since that was the case, why not kill him?</p><p>Jin Xing shut up. He knew that Lu Ming was a ruthless character. Threats would not have an effect on him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, just you wait …”</p><p>Jin Xing roared in his heart, brewing a vicious plan.</p><p>After killing Jin Jue, Lu Ming kept his storage ring and waited quietly.</p><p>A day later, a light screen enveloped Lu Ming. He sat cross-legged and entered the starry sky of the universe.</p><p>The effects of the second row of stone platforms were extraordinary. Lu Ming’s cultivation speed was very fast.</p><p>His degree of awakening of the ruler’s divine power was also rapidly increasing.</p><p>Fifty percent, fifty-five percent …</p><p>Looking at Lu Ming sitting cross-legged on the stone platform, Jin Xing’s eyes were filled with ferocious killing intent. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming had the protection of the array. He could only dream about it.</p><p>‘This guy killed Qin Mu?’</p><p>After a period of time, one of the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorites ended his cultivation. He had already been cultivating on the stone platform for three years. He couldn’t continue cultivating, so he left the stone platform.</p><p>Jin Xing told him the news as soon as he left the stone platform.</p><p>that’s right. Not only did this person kill Qin Mu, but he also killed the proud Son of Heaven of my Jin clan, Jin Jue!</p><p>Jin Xing gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“What? He even killed Jin Jue. Is he that strong?”</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon was also shocked.</p><p>this kid is a monster. He must be eliminated!</p><p>Jin Xing gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Qin Wukong, the pride of the Qin family, is cultivating in the second row. The degree of his divine power awakening has long reached ninety percent. After this cultivation, I’m afraid it’s very close to a hundred percent. In addition, he has broken through to the eighth level with a few of his divine skills. It’s enough to kill Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Qin clan’s chosen said coldly.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Jin Xing was also overjoyed.</p><p>The person they were talking about was the genius of the Qin clan who was cultivating in the second row.</p><p>Time flew by, and soon, two months had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Wukong, the Qin clan’s prodigy, who was cultivating in the second row, woke up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
