At the same time, a terrifying force was aimed at the back of Lu Ming’s head. It was extremely sharp.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spiritual sense was very sharp. He sensed it immediately.</p><p>He activated the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and dodged the attack in a flash. Then, Lu Ming turned around and saw a young man wearing armor and holding a long spear at the place where Lu Ming had just stood.</p><p>This young man was not Chu baxing, but he was dressed like Chu baxing.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>“Chu baxing didn’t kill you, so I’ll kill you in his place!”</p><p>The young man said coldly. His tone was overbearing, as if Lu Ming was dead for sure.</p><p>“It seems that you’re Chu baxing’s man!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. However, his smile contained a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>Since this person wanted to kill him, he was already a dead man in his eyes.</p><p>that’s right. There’s no need for young master Chu baxing to personally deal with trash like you. Since you’ve offended young master Chu baxing, you should be prepared to be killed. Die!</p><p>The young man said coldly. The armor on his body glowed, and his aura was as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The young man took a step forward and thrust his long spear at Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Before the spear radiance reached him, a terrifyingly sharp aura was already charging towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Shen power awakening, 99%!”</p><p>As soon as the other party made a move, Lu Ming could sense that the other party’s divine power had awakened by ninety-nine percent. No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>Unless he met geniuses like Jin Yuan and Chu BA Xing, he was invincible.</p><p>Not to mention that Lu Ming was only a fifth-level heavenly God.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had exchanged two blows with Chu baxing and displayed extraordinary strength, Chu baxing had not used his full strength at that time, and Lu Ming had not transformed into his ancient God Body.</p><p>Unfortunately, the person he met was Lu Ming. He had miscalculated.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>ancient God Body! with a roar, Lu Ming transformed into his ancient God Body. A terrifying aura burst out like a volcano.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear shook and swept out, hitting the opponent’s long spear. The opponent’s long spear trembled wildly and then flew out of his hand. The terrifying power directly caused the arm of the young man from the Chu family to explode.</p><p>ancient God Body! Green-armored ancient God Body! Damn it …</p><p>The young man from the Chu clan growled, his eyes filled with fear. He knew that he had encountered a freak. Without any hesitation, he retreated, wanting to leave this place and tell Chu baxing this news.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not allow him to leave.</p><p>“Break the air …”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly as he cast the three apocalyptic strikes. A beam of dazzling spear light burst out and caught up with the youth of the Chu family in an instant.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear light pierced through the forehead of the young man from the Chu family, killing him.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he kept the storage ring of the young man from the Chu family. Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the two boxes in the courtyard.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His body, which was a few hundred meters tall, stepped into the courtyard. His aura filled the air.</p><p>The young men who were in the middle of a fierce battle sensed Lu Ming’s terrifying aura and were shocked. They stopped fighting and looked at Lu Ming with grave expressions.</p><p>“I want these two boxes. You guys, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke in a domineering manner.</p><p>His words made the young men’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>Hmph, although your strength isn’t bad, you want to monopolize the treasure by yourself? do you think you’re someone like Chu BA Xing? ”</p><p>A young man with a silver knife said coldly.</p><p>This person was from the residence of the nine blades Heavenly King. Naturally, he was unhappy with Lu Ming.</p><p>that’s right. He wants to monopolize it and even wants us to get lost. Hehe, then let’s join hands and make him get lost!</p><p>Another young man said coldly.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had killed the youth from the Chu family, they were not afraid of him since they had so many people with them.</p><p>They did not believe that Lu Ming was merely a fifth-level celestial deity and that his combat strength was really as powerful as Chu baxing.</p><p>“Refusing a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on the other party. He waved his long spear and pressed it against the young men.</p><p>The Spear’s radiance was incomparably huge and filled the entire courtyard, making it impossible for the youths to avoid it.</p><p>“Let’s work together and finish off this brat first, then we’ll fight for the treasure!”</p><p>“Alright, let’s join forces!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, the young men in the courtyard attacked together. They launched a terrifying attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of nine young men, and each of them was a top master. Their degree of awakening of Shen power had reached 80% or even 90%.</p><p>The nine people’s attacks landed on Lu Ming’s huge spear radiance, resulting in a deafening explosion. The force spread in all directions like a level 18 Gale.</p><p>The next moment, the nine Young heaven’s favorites ‘bodies shook violently and they spat out blood at the same time. Their bodies were sent flying like cannonballs, either hitting the ground or the walls.</p><p>All of them convulsed and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Fortunately, the walls and floor were extremely hard and didn’t shatter.</p><p>However, everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>This included some of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion’s geniuses. Their eyes revealed deep disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s ability had actually reached this level. It was really unbelievable.</p><p>The nine young men kept spitting out blood. They looked at Lu Ming with fear in their eyes.</p><p>It was really hard for them to imagine that a fifth-level celestial deity’s combat strength was actually so powerful. The nine of them joined forces and were not even a match for Lu Ming’s one move.</p><p>“Now, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Those young men didn’t dare to stay and left the place in fear. In the blink of an eye, not a single one was left.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to transform into his normal form to check on the two boxes when a cold laugh was heard. hehehe, I didn’t expect that a fifth level celestial deity actually has such powerful strength. Interesting, really interesting!</p><p>The moment the voice rang out, a dark shadow flashed in the courtyard. A ghostly figure appeared.</p><p>“The people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed and he could not help but blurt out.</p><p>This person was not you han, but one of the three geniuses from the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor who had come with you han.</p><p>The man looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze. He stuck out his Scarlet tongue and licked his lips. He sneered, I really want to taste your soul. I can smell it. Your soul must be delicious!</p><p>“Oh, really? I’m afraid you won’t be able to enjoy it!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>hehehe, although your ancient God Body has evolved into a green-armored ancient God, it’s useless against me. Your soul is connected to me!</p><p>As soon as he finished laughing, you Lian’s figure was like a shadow, pouncing towards Lu Ming. His speed was shocking, like a Phantom. In a flash, he was in front of Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
