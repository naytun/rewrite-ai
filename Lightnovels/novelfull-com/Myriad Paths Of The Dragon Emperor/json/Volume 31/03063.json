Along the way, there were many eyeball monsters that tried to kill Lu Ming but they were all easily killed by him.</p><p>Not long after, they went around a few passages and arrived outside a large bronze door.</p><p>“Master, help! Help!”</p><p>Deng Xiu screamed in fear as he desperately tried to push the bronze door open.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The bronze door was opened.</p><p>The moment the bronze door opened, Lu Ming saw the scene behind the door.</p><p>Behind the door was a stone room. In the middle of the stone room, a young woman sat cross-legged. It was Qiu Yue.</p><p>Even from a distance, Lu Ming could see that Qiu Yue’s face revealed a trace of pain, as if she was struggling to hold on. Her body was covered in a layer of nine-colored holy light. However, compared to a few years ago, the nine-colored holy light on Qiu Yue’s body seemed to be much dimmer.</p><p>On Qiu Yue’s head, an eyeball with a diameter of a few meters was shining with a black light and approaching Qiu Yue.</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly relieved to see that. At least Qiu Yue was still holding on and had not been possessed by the other party.</p><p>However, the anger in Lu Ming’s heart was burning.</p><p>“Master, save me!”</p><p>Deng Xiu shouted as he tried to rush towards the stone eyeball.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly as he swung his spear downward. A crescent-shaped spear ray was aimed at Deng Xiu.</p><p>Deng Xiu’s cultivation base was only equivalent to an ordinary half-step Divine King. There was no way he could withstand Lu Ming’s attack. As the Spear’s radiance slashed past, Deng Xiu let out a blood-curdling screech as he was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming strode toward the main door.</p><p>Behind the door was a huge stone room, but it was a mess. The walls of the stone room were full of cracks and dents, as if a great battle had just taken place.</p><p>The buildings here were all covered in runes and were extremely hard. To be able to leave so many cracks and dents on the walls, the strength of the person was definitely astonishing.</p><p>It was very likely that it was left behind by the Great War at the beginning of the heavenly Palace era.</p><p>Lu Ming took a quick glance and did not find anything unusual. He then strode toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Brat, get lost!”</p><p>At this moment, the stone eyeball on Qiu Yue’s head let out a loud roar.</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and swept his long spear towards the stone bead.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The stone bead let out a loud cry. Then, a divine light burst out from the stone eyeball and blasted toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The divine light struck the spear, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a terrifying force coming from the long spear. His body could not help but tremble and he retreated.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, divine light burst out from the stone eyeball. In an instant, dozens of divine lights burst out.</p><p>The space whistled and dozens of divine lights charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying sword, moon slaying sword …”</p><p>Divine power surged wildly as Lu Ming continuously cast the moon slashing move. He used it more than ten times in a row and more than ten crescent-shaped spearlights slashed out, blocking the dozens of divine lights.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to use the star explosion as it was an indiscriminate attack. After it was used, it would engulf Qiu Yue.</p><p>you’re already so powerful at the fifth level of the celestial deity realm. Wait, there are ancient origin characters in your body. They’re the characters ‘battle’ and ‘quantity’. Hahaha, the heavens are really helping me. The heavens have been kind to me. After I possess this girl and combine the two ancient origin characters, I will definitely regain my glory. No, I will be even stronger!</p><p>The stone eyeball began to let out a surprised sound, and then it laughed out loud, as if it was ecstatic.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This stone eyeball was able to see through the two ancient origin characters in his body.</p><p>In the past, Lu Ming had met many God kings, but none of them could see through the ancient origin word in his body. This was because the ancient origin word would hide itself and outsiders could not see it.</p><p>This stone eyeball was amazing.</p><p>“I must destroy this eyeball!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was cold.</p><p>He then brandished his spear and continuously bombarded his opponent.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>A cold voice came from the stone eyeball. It trembled slightly, as if it was preparing an even more terrifying attack.</p><p>However, at this moment, Qiu Yue shouted and the nine-colored divine light on her body suddenly became bright.</p><p>A nine-colored heart could be vaguely seen near her heart, and it was beating continuously.</p><p>Nine-orifice Saint heart.</p><p>It was obvious that Qiu Yue had noticed Lu Ming. When the stone eyeball was distracted by attacking Lu Ming, she launched a counterattack.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The stone eyeball let out a furious roar. It had no choice but to divert more of its energy to deal with Qiu Yue and less to deal with Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the stone room, there were continuous rumbles. Lu Ming kept attacking forward and finally approached the stone eyeball.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming seized the opportunity and struck the stone eyeball with his spear. The stone eyeball shook violently but it was fine. Lu Ming did not break it.</p><p>kid, you can’t break my defense. Although so many years have passed and my strength is not even one in a billion, my defense is still there. You can’t break it. Hahaha!</p><p>The stone eyeball laughed.</p><p>“Is that so? then I’ll pull you away!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Then, nine ice chains flew out and wrapped around the stone eyeball.</p><p>A layer of ice crystals appeared on the stone eyeball, trying to seal it.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>break! the stone eyeball roared, and black divine light kept shooting out of its surface. The ice crystals exploded one after another, and the black divine light hit the ice chains. The ice chains shook violently, and cracks appeared on some of the chains.</p><p>The ice chains were about to break.</p><p>“Get over here!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and pulled the ice chain with all his might, trying to pull the stone eyeball away from Qiu Yue’s head.</p><p>As long as they could pull the stone eyeball away, Qiu Yue would be saved. Even if they couldn’t kill the stone eyeball, they could still escape.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Under the constant attacks of the stone eyeball’s divine light, two of the ice chains were finally broken.</p><p>“You won’t be able to pull me away!”</p><p>The stone eyeball roared.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were calm. With a wave of his hand, two more ice chains flew out and wrapped around the stone eyeball.</p><p>Next, as long as the ice chains were broken, Lu Ming would immediately condense them. Lu Ming had plenty of divine power to waste.</p><p>A moment later, the stone eyeball was finally pulled by Lu Ming. Qiu Yue immediately seized the opportunity to resist when she was pulled a little bit.</p><p>brat, you’re looking for death. Don’t think that I can’t deal with you. Die!</p><p>An angry roar came from the stone eyeball. Then, a ray of light flew out of the stone eyeball and turned into a figure.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man in ancient armor. The most peculiar thing about him was his eyes, which were as bright as two suns.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
