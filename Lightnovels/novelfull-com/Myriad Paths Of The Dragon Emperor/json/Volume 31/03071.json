There is a trace of Jingyu’s Mark in the sovereign’s divine power you cultivate. Although it is very faint, I have guided Jingyu for many years and understand him too well. Thus, even though there is only a trace of Jingyu’s Mark in your sovereign’s divine power, I can still sense it!”</p><p>“Other than Jing Yu’s successor, who else would have Jing Yu’s seal?”</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile.</p><p>“Jing Yu’s Mark?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was racing. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><p>Back when he was on netherworld mountain, he had first looked at Jing Yu’s statue and tried to comprehend the Dao of a ruler. Perhaps it was because of this that his ruler’s divine power had a trace of Jing Yu’s Mark.</p><p>“The reason why you were able to obtain Jing Yu’s inheritance was because you came from the sealed grounds of netherworld mountain, right? how is the current situation of netherworld mountain?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked with a complicated look in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately explained the matter of netherworld mountain.</p><p>sigh, it’s been hard on them. One day, they’ll see the light of day again!</p><p>LAN Shang said. When he said this, his eyes emitted a dazzling radiance.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, what happened back then? Senior Jing Yu, who did this to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>LAN Shang shook his head. I don’t know. What I know is about the same as what Jingyu knows. That year, Jingyu was framed and killed. His trusted aides were either killed or sealed. As for me, I was stripped of my authority. Due to some reasons, I came to the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence!</p><p>LAN Shang sighed. Many things seemed to have happened back then, and he did not want to talk about it.</p><p>that year, Prince Jing Yu must have been framed, ” he said. we must investigate this matter!</p><p>“I promised senior Jing Yu that I would investigate this matter and reverse the verdict. When the time comes, I’ll have to trouble uncle LAN for your help!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>of course, I will definitely do my best to help you. However, now is not the time. There is no need to rush this. Your current goal is to increase your strength. Your current strength is still too weak in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, but he sighed in his heart.</p><p>His strength had increased very quickly, faster than most people, but he always felt that his cultivation was not enough.</p><p>Oh right, you said that you’re from the Qin Tian Galaxy. Why are you here at the universal camp? Oh, are you planning to use the universal camp as a springboard to join the great void Royal sacred Academy? then, with the Academy as your Foundation, you’ll slowly rise up before investigating the case of Prince Jing Yu? ”</p><p>LAN Shang suddenly said.</p><p>“The great void Royal sacred Academy?”</p><p>Lu Ming had a puzzled look.</p><p>“You don’t know about the great void Royal sacred Academy?”</p><p>LAN Shang was surprised.</p><p>“I don’t know. What does it do?”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and asked.</p><p>the great void Royal sacred Academy is the gathering place of all the geniuses of the great void Holy dynasty. Not only do all the top geniuses of the great void Holy dynasty gather there, even the princes and princesses of the great void Holy dynasty study there!</p><p>that place is where the great void Holy dynasty nurtures its talents. Almost all the important figures of the great void Holy dynasty come from the great void Holy dynasty. Back then, Prince Jing Yu also studied there!</p><p>however, if you want to enter the great void Holy dynasty, you have to be recommended by an important person in the great void Holy dynasty. Otherwise, only the universal camp of the Heavenly King manors can enter!</p><p>LAN Shang explained.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly understood.</p><p>In the past, he had heard Wu Zifeng and the rest say that if one wanted to enter the core grounds of the great void Holy dynasty to cultivate, one had to first join the universal camp.</p><p>If one did not join the universal camp, they would not be able to head to the great void Holy dynasty to cultivate.</p><p>“I didn’t come to the star sky Camp to enter the great void Royal sacred Academy!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Then what’s your purpose in coming here?”</p><p>LAN Shang was surprised.</p><p>it’s for the treasure of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, the case of the nine absolute God crystal being stolen!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Nine absolute God crystal? I’ve also heard about this. How is it? How’s your investigation going?”</p><p>LAN Shang asked.</p><p>“I still don’t have many clues …”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and immediately told him about his experience during this period of time.</p><p>He also suspected that there was evidence in the night Demon King’s storage ring, but he couldn’t find one thing.</p><p>there are some ways to seal some evidence deeply. It’s normal that you can’t find it. How about this? give me the storage ring of the night Demon King, and I’ll help you look for it!</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“Thank you, uncle LAN!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He immediately took out Darknight Moye’s storage ring and handed it to LAN Shang.</p><p>LAN Shang had been Jing Yu’s teacher back then. His cultivation was unfathomable, and he was knowledgeable. Perhaps he could find some evidence.</p><p>If they could find the evidence and the people who had colluded with the dark ice Clan to steal the nine absolute divine crystal, the safety of Qin heaven star area would be solved.</p><p>LAN Shang took the storage ring and put it away.</p><p>“Oh right, there’s one more thing.”</p><p>LAN Shang suddenly changed his tone. He coughed and said, ” “When Jing Yu was still alive, I made an agreement with him. If we have any descendants of the same gender, we will become brothers or sisters. If they are of the opposite sex, we will become husband and wife.”</p><p>after Jing Yu passed away, he no longer had any descendants. As his successor, you’re his descendant. I’ll definitely fulfill my promise, and Ling ‘er will marry you!</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was caught off guard. He did not expect LAN Shang to mention this.</p><p>uncle LAN, you can’t do this. I’ve only met miss LAN Ling once, no, only twice, and you want to marry her to me? isn’t this too rushed? ”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p>that’s easy. You can move in together and get along with each other. You’ll be familiar with each other in the future!</p><p>LAN Shang laughed and was very open.</p><p>“No, uncle LAN. To be honest, I already have a wife!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. It’s normal for a man to have three wives and four concubines.”</p><p>LAN Shang said.</p><p>“？”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This blue merchant was very open-minded. He pushed his daughter into the fire pit just like that.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had Xie nianqing and Qiu Yue.</p><p>In addition, he also had two female confidants, Mu Lan and Feng Ling. It was already enough of a headache for him. He didn’t want another one.</p><p>Moreover, at the thought of LAN Ling’s expression as if she could not wait to kill him, Lu Ming rejected even more.</p><p>Staying together with LAN Ling? what a joke! He wouldn’t even know when he would be killed by the other party.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, no, I still can’t …”</p><p>Lu Ming still shook his head.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You’re saying that my daughter isn’t good enough for you!”</p><p>LAN Shang’s face sank as he coldly said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
