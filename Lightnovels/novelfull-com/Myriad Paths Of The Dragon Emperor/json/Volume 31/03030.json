Then, the curtain fluttered and a young figure stepped out.</p><p>It was a young man who looked like he was in his twenties. He was very handsome, but his eyes were narrow and sharp, like a blade. Looking into his eyes, one would feel as if their body was being cut by a blade.</p><p>\"Heavens ... Young master sky Mantis!\"</p><p>The other three young men and women hurriedly saluted the young man.</p><p>The young man's name was young master tianmang.</p><p>\"Why didn't you save him just now?\"</p><p>Lu Ming asked casually. The 'he' that Lu Ming was referring to was naturally the saber-hugging youth from before.</p><p>With the distance just now, young master sky Mantis had the chance to save him, but the other party was indifferent.</p><p>\"What's the point of keeping a good-for-nothing? I can feed my li beast!\"</p><p>Young master tianmang said indifferently.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The two wild beasts seemed to be cooperating with young master sky Mantis. They roared, and their ferocious killing intent filled the air.</p><p>The other three young men and women had unsightly expressions, but they didn't dare to make a sound.</p><p>In young master sky Mantis's eyes, their lives were not even worth two dire beasts.</p><p>\"Leave this brat to me. You guys take down those people and make up for your mistakes, understand?\"</p><p>Young master sky Mantis spoke again as he glanced at the three.</p><p>\"Yes!\"</p><p>The three of them quickly nodded, and their blades flashed as they charged towards Wu Ming and Wu Yue.</p><p>However, with a single thought from Lu Ming, nine ice chains flew out and enveloped Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest. The three young men's saber-lights slashed at the ice chains, but they were all blocked.</p><p>\"Brat, your opponent is me!\"</p><p>At this moment, young master sky Mantis shouted coldly. His palm was like a knife, and he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>He used his palm as a blade, and the edge of the blade was shocking. He was much stronger than the young man and the others.</p><p>\"Get lost!\"</p><p>ancient God Body!  Lu Ming roared. His body expanded rapidly. He used the ancient God Body and turned into a young ancient God that was hundreds of meters tall.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The long spear swept up and hit young master sky Mantis's knife light. A violent boom was heard. Young master sky Mantis 'knife light kept shaking. Then, his face changed, and he retreated.</p><p>\"Kill!\"</p><p>After pushing back young master sky Mantis, Lu Ming suddenly turned around. With a shake of his long spear, three spear gleams burst out and headed toward the other three young men and women.</p><p>Lu Ming had the ancient God Body. His attacks were so powerful that the three young men could not withstand them.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The three spear lights pierced through and blood splattered everywhere. The three young men were killed on the spot.</p><p>\"You're looking for death!\"</p><p>After young master sky Mantis steadied himself, he saw that the three young men and women had been killed. He roared in anger, and a terrifying aura burst out from his body.</p><p>An ancient aura filled the air.</p><p>Origin divine power factor!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was a peerless genius who had awakened the origin divine power factor. He was also a half-step Divine King.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes were extremely cold, and the cold killing intent from his body continued to spread.</p><p>He had not used his full strength in the previous attack. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful and to have a trump card. He suddenly used the ancient God Body to push him back.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis took a step forward. A saber beam soared into the sky, and a vast pressure pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>this is more interesting. Kill!</p><p>die!  Lu Ming shouted, his fighting spirit soaring. He raised his spear and charged at young master sky Mantis. A crescent-shaped spear light slashed down.</p><p>\"Heavenly blade art!\"</p><p>Young master sky Mantis also cultivated the heavenly knife technique. With a wave of his palm, a dazzling knife light slashed toward Lu Ming. It was much stronger than the young men and women from before.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two attacks collided, creating a huge wave. The Qi gushed out in all directions like a tide.</p><p>The two of them swayed slightly and then started to fight again.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>It was a completely head-on battle. The blade-light and the spear-light collided more than a dozen times.</p><p>\"How can this kid be so strong?\"</p><p>The continuous exchange of blows made young master sky Mantis more and more frightened.</p><p>He was a peerless genius of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. He had awakened the origin divine power factor at the half-step Divine King realm. He was almost invincible among those below the divine King realm. There were only a few who could fight him.</p><p>He would never have dreamed that there would be a day when he actually could not even take down a fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>\"Heaven star body, transform!\"</p><p>Young master sky Mantis shouted as his body began to grow rapidly. In the end, he turned into a giant Mantis that was over a hundred meters tall.</p><p>\"So it's a Mantis, so ugly!\"</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>The Mantis that young master sky Mantis had transformed into wasn't like the ancient God Body. It wasn't some kind of secret technique. It was young master sky Mantis himself.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was some kind of Mantis.</p><p>\"It's your honor to be able to see my true form. Die!\"</p><p>Young master sky Mantis's cold voice was heard. With a few stomps of his feet, he charged toward Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Then, he slashed at Lu Ming with his two front claws.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis's two front claws were like two divine knives, extremely sharp.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his long spear and welcomed the attack.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>After a few consecutive collisions, Lu Ming's body was slightly pushed back more than ten steps. The long spear in his hand trembled continuously and a few chips appeared on it.</p><p>\"What sharp claws!\"</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed.</p><p>The other party's sharp claws were extremely sharp and even tougher than a divine artifact. Even Lu Ming's level nine high-grade divine artifact was chipped.</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, you guys retreat. Retreat further away!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was extremely fast. Lu Ming had to be distracted to protect Wu Ming and the others. It was difficult for him to perform at his best.</p><p>\"Alright!\"</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest knew about Lu Ming's situation. They flew backward rapidly.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis casually glanced at Wu Ming and the others but did not pursue them. In his eyes, Wu Ming and the others were just small fries. Lu Ming was the big fish.</p><p>As long as he killed Lu Ming, the others would not be able to escape.</p><p>\"Kill, kill, kill!\"</p><p>die!  young master sky Mantis shouted coldly. He stomped on the ground and pounced on Lu Ming at an amazing speed. He kept slashing with his two front claws. In an instant, he had slashed more than a hundred times.</p><p>\"Come on!\"</p><p>Lu Ming's fighting spirit was strong, and the divine power in his body burst out. With a shake of his long spear, he cast the three apocalyptic strikes, pushing the three apocalyptic strikes to the extreme, to the extent of the eighth level.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Spear's radiance shot out like a meteor shower toward young master sky Mantis.</p><p>The spear light and the blade light collided once again, and it was as if stars had exploded in the sky. Waves of energy blasted into the ground, creating huge pits and ravines. It was a scene of destruction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
