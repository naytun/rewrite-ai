He used all his strength, and a terrifying spear ray burst out and then exploded.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The destructive power struck the light screen of the formation, but the formation only trembled for a moment before returning to normal.</p><p>“This kid actually has such powerful strength!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s explosive attack, Deng Xiu was very shocked.</p><p>He was secretly glad that he did not attack Lu Ming directly. Instead, he brought Lu Ming under the stone tablet and trapped him with the yin-yang formation.</p><p>However, he immediately laughed again. hehehe, kid, don’t waste your energy. You can’t break this array with brute force!</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the other party and continued to launch attacks.</p><p>He had to break this formation and save Qiu Yue. Otherwise, Qiu Yue’s body would be taken over.</p><p>Lu Ming must not let such a thing happen.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming launched attacks in a frenzy. Streams of terrifying spear radiance bombarded the light screen. However, it was of no use.</p><p>No matter how Lu Ming attacked, the light screen only shook slightly. Nothing happened to it.</p><p>No matter how strong the attack was, it was the same.</p><p>It was completely unbreakable.</p><p>After a moment, Lu Ming stopped. His eyes were extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Old Liang, aren’t you able to sense the energy of the formation? Why didn’t you inform me when that old man brought me in?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>Last time, when they were ambushed, the quantity formula had sensed the formation that the other party had set up in advance.</p><p>Why didn’t he warn him this time? if he did, Lu Ming would be alert and he would not be trapped by the array.</p><p>kid, do you think I’m the guy with the word ‘formation’? I can sense any kind of formation. Last time, I could sense it because the formation that the other party set up was a killing formation. It was just set up not long ago and the energy was surging, so I could sense it!</p><p>and this formation is a trap formation. Its energy is extremely gentle, especially since it has been set up for who knows how many years. It’s usually not activated and there’s no energy reaction at all. How can I sense it? ”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula shouted unhappily.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could not blame the quantity formula for this.</p><p>“I’ve already seen that there’s a big formation here!”</p><p>At this moment, another voice rang out in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>This voice was clearly the voice of the life soul, vitality stone rock spirit.</p><p>you already knew it. Why didn’t you remind me? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Do I need to remind you? As the owner of the life Soul Origin stone, if he couldn’t even solve such a small problem, how was he going to compete with his other competitors in the future? How do you control a complete life soul vitality stone and become a universe Overlord?”</p><p>The rock spirit asked continuously.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned by the question and he gritted his teeth.</p><p>This old fellow did not remind him on purpose. Lu Ming wished he could stomp on his face.</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth in hatred.</p><p>“You guys, do you have any way to get out?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“No, I didn’t!”</p><p>The rock spirit and the ” quantity ” formula spoke in unison. Lu Ming almost vomited blood.</p><p>“Hahaha, kid, are you in despair now? Even a peak God King expert wouldn’t be able to break out of this formation by force. Only by using a special method can you escape!”</p><p>Deng Xiu burst out laughing. He felt very good when he saw Lu Ming’s defeated look.</p><p>“Special method?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“What’s wrong? What special method do you want to know? Alright, then I’ll tell you!”</p><p>Deng Xiu smiled as he stared at the stone tablet. the way to break this formation is the secret skill on the stone tablet, the yin-yang divine eyes!</p><p>as long as I can cultivate the yin-yang divine eyes, I can easily break this yin-yang formation!</p><p>“Secret skill, yin-yang divine eyes!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he looked at the stone tablet.</p><p>however, I have to remind you that there are conditions to cultivate the yin-yang divine eyes. Two people must control two completely opposite divine-grade divine powers and have the same mind in order to cultivate it successfully!</p><p>“In addition, even if you meet the requirements, with your unparalleled talent, you won’t be able to successfully comprehend it without a hundred years. How about this condition? It’s simple, hahaha!”</p><p>At the end of his sentence, Deng Xiu burst out laughing even more madly.</p><p>It was impossible for Lu Ming to fulfill the conditions he mentioned.</p><p>In order to cultivate the yin-yang divine eyes, two completely opposite divine-grade divine powers were required. This required two people, and their minds were connected.</p><p>Even so, no matter how talented he was, he would need at least a hundred years to comprehend it.</p><p>A hundred years. Qiu Yue’s body would have been successfully taken over by her master.</p><p>That was why Deng Xiu mentioned this condition. He was not afraid that Lu Ming would be able to cultivate it successfully. He had said it specifically to anger Lu Ming.</p><p>He knew the method but he could not cultivate it. He wanted to see how desperate Lu Ming was.</p><p>However, he was disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look desperate. Instead, his eyes lit up as if he had seen a ray of hope.</p><p>They were two completely opposite divine-grade divine powers. The divine power of the sun and the divine power of the moon that Lu Ming controlled were two completely opposite divine-grade divine powers.</p><p>One was yang and the other was Yin. One was extreme yang and the other was extreme Yin.</p><p>Other people would need two people to control two types of divine power, but Lu Ming had it alone.</p><p>Also, they needed to be connected in their hearts. No matter how connected two people were, how could one person be connected?</p><p>As long as Lu Ming could successfully comprehend it before Qiu Yue was possessed, he would be able to escape and save Qiu Yue.</p><p>Eight years!</p><p>According to Deng Xiu, the beckstone would be able to successfully possess Lu Ming in eight years. Lu Ming had to successfully comprehend the technique within eight years.</p><p>At once, Lu Ming ignored Deng Xiu and sat cross-legged under the stone tablet. He began to study the runes on the stone tablet in detail.</p><p>Hmph, you still want to comprehend the yin-yang divine eyes? dream on!</p><p>Deng Xiu laughed in disdain.</p><p>He refused to believe that Lu Ming could successfully comprehend it. First of all, he needed two completely opposite divine-grade divine powers. It was impossible for Lu Ming to have them.</p><p>He thought that Lu Ming was in despair and knew that he could not get out. He might as well put on an act for him to see.</p><p>hehehe, just wait. When master successfully takes over the body, he will come and kill you!</p><p>Deng Xiu sneered and retreated to the side to monitor Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was focused on the runes on the stone tablet.</p><p>The stone tablet was covered with mysterious runes that interwove with each other, forming an extremely mysterious pattern.</p><p>Lu Ming felt dizzy after looking at it for a while. As Deng Xiu had said, even if one met the requirements and had unparalleled talent, it would not be easy to master the yin-yang divine eyes. It was too difficult and harder to cultivate than any of Lu Ming’s Secret skills.</p><p>After resting for a while, Lu Ming continued to comprehend.</p><p>Time flew by and in the blink of an eye, a few months had passed. Lu Ming finally had some clues.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
