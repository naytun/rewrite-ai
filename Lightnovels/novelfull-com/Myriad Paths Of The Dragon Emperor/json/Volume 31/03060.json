It looked ancient and was a few meters in diameter. It was emitting a hazy glow.</p><p>However, at first glance, this ball looked like an eyeball, a huge stone eyeball, which was a little strange.</p><p>It seemed like Qiu Yue was really accepting the inheritance.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Qiu Yue was fine. It was no wonder that Lu Ming could not transmit his voice through the voice transmission jade talisman all these years.</p><p>Qiu Yue was in this underground space, and she was still receiving the inheritance. It would be a wonder if she could get out.</p><p>The old man waved his hand, and the image disappeared.</p><p>Do You Believe Me Now? your wife is at the critical moment of receiving the inheritance. I estimate that in a few years, she will be able to complete the inheritance. At that time, your wife’s cultivation will skyrocket and she will become a peerless heaven’s favorite!</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It seemed that Qiu Yue’s opportunity was indeed not small.</p><p>“I’m Deng Xiu. What’s your name, kid?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“Junior is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’ll take a few more years for your wife to receive the legacy. Why don’t you wait for her here? you can leave with her after she’s done with the legacy. How about that?”</p><p>Deng Xiu said.</p><p>“This junior also thinks so!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>well, that’s it then. But you won’t just wait here for the next few years. It’s your good fortune to be able to come here. I’ll give you a secret skill. Study it well for the next few years. Whether you can successfully cultivate it will depend on your talent!</p><p>Deng Xiu smiled.</p><p>“A secret technique?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The master of this place was a strong practitioner in the early days of the heavenly Palace era. The secret skills left behind were probably not to be underestimated.</p><p>Lu Ming was tempted.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me!”</p><p>After saying that, Deng Xiu turned around and walked towards the main door behind him.</p><p>Lu Ming followed behind.</p><p>This underground space was very large, with many palaces and stone rooms.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Deng Xiu and went around in circles. They passed through several passages and finally came to a stone tablet.</p><p>The stone tablet was huge, hundreds of meters tall, and there were strange runes carved on it.</p><p>These runes intertwined together and seemed to form pairs of eyes.</p><p>there’s a secret technique carved on this stone tablet. It’s called the yin-yang divine eyes. It’s a type of eye technique. If you successfully cultivate it, you can kill people just by opening and closing your eyes. Its power is extremely terrifying!</p><p>Deng Xiu introduced.</p><p>As they spoke, the two of them arrived at the stone tablet.</p><p>Lu Ming studied the runes on the stone tablet seriously.</p><p>Right at this moment, Deng Xiu’s figure suddenly retreated explosively. In the blink of an eye, he had already retreated a thousand meters away.</p><p>“Senior, what are you doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately realized that something was not right. He had a bad premonition in his heart and wanted to leave the place immediately. However, it was too late.</p><p>Runes suddenly appeared around the stone tablet.</p><p>Countless runes lit up, forming a large array.</p><p>One side of the formation was white while the other side was black. It was like a Tai Chi formation, and it covered an area of a thousand meters.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed as he tried to rush out of the array’s range. However, when he came to the edge, a light curtain spread out and blocked his figure.</p><p>Lu Ming crashed into the light screen, making a loud rumbling sound.</p><p>“Hahaha, kid, stay inside obediently!”</p><p>At this moment, Deng Xiu’s face was no longer amiable. Instead, it revealed a malevolent expression as he burst out laughing.</p><p>“Deng Xiu, you’re lying to me?”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>I’m not lying to you. My name is indeed Deng Xiu, and what’s carved on the stone tablet is indeed a secret technique called the yin-yang divine eyes!</p><p>Deng Xiu sneered.</p><p>“Then why did you trick me into entering this formation?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“It’s very simple. I want you to stay here obediently so that you don’t ruin master’s plans!”</p><p>Deng Xiu sneered.</p><p>“Master’s good news? What do you mean? could it be that stone orb?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>hehe, it seems that you’re quite clever. To tell you the truth, this is not my master’s cave dwelling at all. The real owner of this place was killed by my master at the beginning of the era of the heavenly Palace. Unfortunately, my master was also seriously injured. Only one eye was left, and he has been sleeping until now!</p><p>my master didn’t wake up until your wife, the girl called Qiu Yue, came in. That girl is amazing. She has a nine-orifice Saint heart. As long as my master occupies her body and takes over her body, he can be revived and return to the peak. Hahaha!</p><p>Deng Xiu laughed heartily as he explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart continued to sink.</p><p>It turned out that what Deng Xiu had said earlier was all a lie.</p><p>What Qiu Yue was receiving the inheritance of a Supreme Master was all nonsense.</p><p>In fact, the ball had taken a fancy to Qiu Yue’s physique and wanted to possess her.</p><p>The scene that Deng Xiu had shown Lu Ming earlier was not Qiu Yue accepting the legacy but Qiu Yue resisting the other party’s possession.</p><p>Qiu Yue was facing a crisis.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was extremely ugly.</p><p>Speaking of which, that girl’s mind is really tough. She’s been resisting for so many years. However, no matter how tough she is, she can’t resist for long. In ten years at most, no, eight years at most, she will be completely possessed by master. Master will take us out of this damn place and dominate the primeval universe. Hahaha!</p><p>At the end of his sentence, Deng Xiu burst out laughing. He was extremely pleased with himself.</p><p>As he laughed, Deng Xiu’s body began to transform rapidly. In the end, it turned into a huge eyeball that floated in the air, looking extremely ferocious.</p><p>“Hehe, to tell you the truth, I don’t have an ancestor at all. I’m just a manifestation of master’s minced meat!”</p><p>Deng Xiu continued to smile.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming knew very well that he had been targeted by the other party the moment he entered this place. The other party had deliberately disguised himself as an amiable old man and told a series of lies in order to trick Lu Ming here and trap him.</p><p>However, Deng Xiu was extremely cunning. There were some truths and lies in his words and Lu Ming was fooled.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared loudly. He would definitely not let the other party succeed.</p><p>A long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Although the long spear that Lu Ming had used previously had been shattered during his battle with Chu baxing, he still had many spare long Spears in his hands.</p><p>This one was also a level nine divine grade divine artifact.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>The divine power in Lu Ming’s body burst out and he slashed his spear forward.</p><p>A crescent-shaped spear radiance struck the light screen at the edge of the formation. The light screen only trembled slightly and was completely fine.</p><p>hehe, kid, don’t waste your energy. You can’t break this Yin Yang formation!</p><p>Deng Xiu sneered.</p><p>“I don’t believe …”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die!   Lu Ming roared, his body rapidly growing in size as he transformed into a green-armored ancient God.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
