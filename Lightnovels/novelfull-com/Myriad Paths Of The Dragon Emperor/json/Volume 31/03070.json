Therefore, the Golden Dragon divine power and the four-eyed Divine Dragon could not merge.</p><p>Lu Ming was still very eager to have the corresponding divine-grade divine energy for these two types of divine energy.</p><p>As long as he obtained the corresponding divine-grade divine energy, the divine energy in Lu Ming’s body would all be transformed into divine-grade divine energy. There would be no difference in levels.</p><p>In addition, the divine Dragon materialization technique required divine power related to Dragons to activate in order to unleash its power to the extreme.</p><p>In addition, the yin-yang divine eyes that he had just cultivated required divine power related to the eyes. The four-eye divine power could improve the yin-yang divine eyes, and if he cultivated divine-grade divine power similar to the four-eye divine power, the improvement would be even greater.</p><p>“I still need to find an opportunity to inquire about these two Shen powers!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and then thought about the four types of divine-grade mystical skills in his hands.</p><p>He didn’t plan to cultivate all four divine-grade techniques.</p><p>He already had enough divine-grade divine power under his control. The amount of energy needed to raise so many types of divine-grade divine power at the same time was already very shocking.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming planned to awaken the divine power factor. This would take a lot of Lu Ming’s energy. He did not have that much energy to cultivate.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ming did not intend to cultivate any of the four divine-grade mystical techniques. However, one of them caught his attention.</p><p>Overlord spear technique!</p><p>This was a divine-grade wondrous technique that he had obtained from Chu baxing. After successfully cultivating it, one would be able to condense the Overlord Spear’s power, which was extremely powerful.</p><p>This Overlord spear force greatly increased the power of the spear technique. It was the same principle as the inextinguishable sword force to sword users.</p><p>Lu Ming used a spear. Although the inextinguishable sword force was powerful, it was not very suitable for a long spear.</p><p>If he could control the Overlord Spear’s force, he could push Lu Ming’s spear technique to the extreme.</p><p>Another important reason was that Lu Ming had also obtained a godly technique from Chu baxing.</p><p>This divine technique was called ” clomaros ‘strike “. It made Lu Ming think of Chu baxing’s ultimate move, clomaros’ strike.</p><p>The Wargod’s strike came from the Wargod strike.</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes that Lu Ming cultivated only had a total of nine stages. Lu Ming had already cultivated to the eighth stage. Once he cultivated to the ninth stage, it would be the end.</p><p>At that time, Lu Ming would need to find new godly skills to cultivate.</p><p>As for Wargod strike, it was divided into thirteen stages. This was enough for Lu Ming to cultivate for a long time.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming decided to cultivate the ‘Overlord spear technique’. He would not cultivate the other three divine techniques for the time being.</p><p>After putting away the other three divine techniques, Lu Ming took out the Overlord spear technique and began to study it in detail.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed. Lu Ming had already made some progress.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was already very familiar with the cultivation of divine-grade mystical techniques. He would be able to comprehend them much faster if he were to change to another one.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming was cultivating when he suddenly sensed an aura approaching from outside the courtyard.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He ended his cultivation and walked out of the courtyard.</p><p>As soon as he walked out of the courtyard, he saw an extremely beautiful woman standing in the air, like a fairy descending to the mortal world.</p><p>This woman was none other than LAN Ling.</p><p>Could it be that the other party had killed their way here?</p><p>“What are you doing here? Could it be that you still want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said coldly.</p><p>Now, she wasn’t afraid of the other party. If the other party wanted to make a move again, he didn’t mind giving the other party an unforgettable lesson.</p><p>LAN Ling’s expression was very cold. She glared at Lu Ming and gritted her teeth as if she could not wait to kill Lu Ming immediately.</p><p>But in the end, she held back and said coldly, ” “My father wants to see you!”</p><p>“Your father?”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. Then, his eyes flickered.</p><p>LAN Ling’s father was Jing Yu’s teacher.</p><p>“Are you going to see him or not? I’ve already passed on my message. If you don’t want to see me, then I’ll leave!”</p><p>After LAN Ling finished speaking, she turned to leave. It was as if she could not wait for Lu Ming not to see her father.</p><p>“Yes, why not?”</p><p>Lu Ming rose into the air and followed behind LAN Ling.</p><p>The other party’s father was Jing Yu’s teacher. He was definitely an important figure in the great void Holy dynasty. If Lu Ming wanted to reverse Jing Yu’s verdict, it would definitely be much easier if he could borrow the other party’s power.</p><p>Why did he disappear? Lu Ming was not stupid.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>LAN Ling snorted coldly when she saw Lu Ming following her. She seemed to be very unhappy.</p><p>The Indigo spirit continued to fly towards the peak of Star Peak.</p><p>“You and your father live on the peak of Star Peak?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“Hmph!” LAN Ling snorted.</p><p>“Isn’t your father the teacher of Prince Jingyu? Why isn’t he in the capital of the great void Holy dynasty, but in the nine absolute Heavenly King’s residence’s universal camp?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Hmph!” LAN Ling snorted.</p><p>“What happened back then? Do you understand?” Lu Ming asked,</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>LAN Ling snorted.</p><p>“？？？”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He could only shut his mouth. No matter what he asked, the other party would only reply with a cold snort.</p><p>Not long after, the two of them arrived at a courtyard not far from the peak of Star Peak.</p><p>Outside the courtyard, there was a small lake. The water was so clear that one could see the bottom. One could even see small fish swimming around in the water.</p><p>On the surface of the lake, there was a middle-aged man with graying hair at his temples. He wore an ordinary linen robe and sat cross-legged on the surface of the lake, as if he was admiring the small fish in the lake.</p><p>“Father!”</p><p>LAN Ling called out softly.</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>The middle-aged man stood up and looked at Lu Ming. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming, Lu Ming, and LAN Ling.</p><p>“So this is Jingyu’s teacher? However, why is there no divine power fluctuation coming from his body? he’s like a mortal. Perhaps his cultivation is too high and the gap between us is too big!”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts.</p><p>The middle-aged man also sized Lu Ming up carefully. His eyes were bright as if he could see through Lu Ming.</p><p>not bad, not bad. Your fate is so profound that I can’t see through it at all. As expected of Jing Yu’s successor!</p><p>The middle-aged man nodded and said, ” “Lu Ming, come with me. I have something to tell you!”</p><p>With that, the middle-aged man walked into the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he followed the other party into the courtyard.</p><p>LAN Ling didn’t follow them, but stayed outside the courtyard.</p><p>Walking into the courtyard, there were stone tables and stone chairs.</p><p>“Sit!”</p><p>The middle-aged man sat down on a stone bench and waved his hand, indicating for Lu Ming to take a seat.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and sat down.</p><p>“I’m called LAN Shang!”</p><p>The man introduced himself.</p><p>“Senior LAN Shang!”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted him.</p><p>there’s no need to stand on ceremony. You’re Jing Yu’s successor, so logically speaking, you’re two generations younger than me. However, since we’re friends, you can just call me uncle LAN!</p><p>LAN Shang said with a smile, making people feel like they were bathing in the spring breeze.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and called uncle LAN.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
