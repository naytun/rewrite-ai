He blocked it?</p><p>Many people were stunned. They did not expect Lu Ming to be able to block Chu baxing’s move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s strength is not bad. However, Chu baxing’s move just now should not have used much strength. It was just a casual move!</p><p>indeed. If Chu baxing were to get serious, how could this brat possibly block him? ”</p><p>Many people were discussing, especially those from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. They could tell that Lu Ming was only a fifth-level celestial deity. How could he block Chu baxing’s attack?</p><p>Chu baxing definitely hadn’t used much strength just now.</p><p>Of course, those who had witnessed the battle between Lu Ming and Jin Yuan would not think so. They knew how terrifying Lu Ming was.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s eyes flickered with anticipation. He was looking forward to the battle between Lu Ming and Chu baxing. It would be best if both of them were seriously injured.</p><p>He wanted to get rid of both of them.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Chu baxing himself was also slightly taken aback, and he let out a soft “en,” clearly very surprised.</p><p>He was very clear on how powerful that move of his earlier was. He indeed did not use much power in that move. However, ordinary ninth level celestial deities absolutely could not withstand that move of his and would have their cultivation crippled in an instant.</p><p>However, he was very surprised that Lu Ming could block this move with just a fifth-level celestial deity.</p><p>not bad, you’re quite strong. No wonder you’re so arrogant. However, you’re still too young to be arrogant in front of me, Chu baxing!</p><p>Chu baxing said coldly. The aura on his body exploded like a volcano, and an ancient aura filled the air, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He understood that he had encountered a top expert.</p><p>Unless he released his own aura, it was difficult to tell that someone had awakened the origin divine power factor. Previously, Lu Ming had indeed not been able to tell that Chu baxing was a prodigy who had awakened the origin divine power.</p><p>However, even if Lu Ming had known about it, his attitude would not have changed.</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing shouted coldly and sent out another palm strike.</p><p>This move was exactly the same as the previous one. A huge palm grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the aura it exuded was completely different from the previous move. It was much stronger than the previous move.</p><p>Even a half-step Divine King genius would be severely injured and suppressed by this attack.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming activated the fourfold combat power of the battle formula and punched out with both fists.</p><p>&Nbsp; Roar Roar Roar …</p><p>A series of Dragon roars rang out as Nine Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed in succession, pouncing toward Chu BA Xing’s palm.</p><p>Explosions rang out continuously as the nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons exploded. However, in the end, Chu baxing’s palm also crumbled and turned into nothingness.</p><p>What?</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually blocked it again.</p><p>Chu baxing’s move just now was no small matter. Its power was astonishing, and everyone could feel it.</p><p>Many half-step Divine King geniuses felt that even if they went all out, they might not be able to block it. However, Lu Ming, a fifth-level heavenly God, managed to block it.</p><p>“This kid is so strong!”</p><p>Many people were secretly shocked.</p><p>Chu baxing, in particular, was filled with shock and a cold killing intent.</p><p>He, Chu baxing, was a Supreme prodigy who had awakened the origin divine power factor and a descendant of the God of War. However, he had not been able to take down Lu Ming with two consecutive moves. He felt embarrassed.</p><p>His eyes darkened, and a golden spear appeared in his hand.</p><p>He was going to get serious and kill Lu Ming with a powerful method.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu, it’s great that you’re fine!”</p><p>At this moment, a few voices could be heard. It was Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others who flew over.</p><p>They were at the periphery earlier. They only noticed Lu Ming when there was a commotion here. They quickly flew over.</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, stand further away. A small matter has happened here. I’ll explain in detail to you after I’ve settled the matter here!</p><p>Lu Ming told Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>Many people were speechless. He was truly arrogant. Facing a heaven’s favorite like Chu BA Xing, he still said that this was a small matter.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing was so angry that he laughed coldly.</p><p>“Hehehe, this place is really lively!”</p><p>“It seems that we are not too late!”</p><p>At this moment, a few cold voices came from the sky in the distance.</p><p>This voice was erratic, but it was extremely cold, causing one’s heart to feel a chill.</p><p>Then, a few black lights flew over from the distance at an amazing speed. In the blink of an eye, a few figures appeared not far away.</p><p>It could be seen that these were a few youths, but their figures were extremely strange.</p><p>Their figures were shrouded by a black ghostly Qi, and their bodies seemed to be constantly twisting as if they were illusory.</p><p>Cold air was constantly emitted from their bodies.</p><p>“You guys are … The people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor?”</p><p>Someone’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Hehehe, it seems like you guys have recognized me!”</p><p>One of the ghostly-looking young men sneered.</p><p>Many people’s faces changed.</p><p>The nine serenity Heavenly King Manor was one of the 27 Heavenly King manors in the great void Holy dynasty. It was the most evil Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>It was said that before the great void Holy dynasty was established, there was a sect called the nine Serenities sect. They were extremely powerful and occupied many star fields.</p><p>After that, the great void Holy dynasty rose and swept across the world. The nine Serenities sect saw that they were no match for the dynasty and surrendered.</p><p>After the establishment of the great void Holy dynasty, the nine Serenities sect was conferred as one of the 27 Heavenly King manors, and they still ruled the original territory of the nine Serenities sect.</p><p>Therefore, the people under the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor all cultivated the nine Serenities sect’s cultivation methods from back then. They were extremely evil, ghostly, and terrifying.</p><p>I’ve finally found it. The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine saber Heavenly King mansion. So many paragons and so many powerful souls. Good, good!</p><p>One of the figures laughed sharply and suddenly, his body flashed and he pounced on the few youths closest to him.</p><p>The young men were shocked. They shouted angrily and attacked with all their strength.</p><p>However, the young man from the residence of the nine Serenities Heavenly King did not Dodge at all, as if he had not seen the attacks.</p><p>However, a strange scene appeared. When the attacks landed on his body, he twisted his body in a strange way and flashed like a ghost, causing all the attacks to miss.</p><p>Then, the Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion landed in front of the young men and clawed out. A few ghost claws appeared and grabbed the young men.</p><p>‘</p><p>A few young men let out shrill screams as their souls were grabbed by the other party.</p><p>Then, the Paragon of the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion opened his mouth and swallowed the souls of the young men. The young men’s cries stopped abruptly.</p><p>Such a strange scene made many people gasp.</p><p>The other party was actually able to directly grab someone’s soul and then swallow it in one gulp. It was simply too evil.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
