Wherever the sword Qi passed, planets exploded one after another. Even a few stars were extinguished.</p><p>Lu Ming was flabbergasted by the huge and boundless sword Qi that pierced through the starry sky. It took him a long time to react.</p><p>“What a terrifying sword Qi!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Then, his eyes lit up. This was the origin divine power of the inextinguishable sword force.</p><p>Lu Ming approached them rapidly, channeling the inextinguishable sword force at the same time.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of sword Qi slashed at Lu Ming. The aura almost made Lu Ming’s mind collapse. He only managed to calm himself down after letting out a loud roar.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The sound of the sword rang out unceasingly. The sword Qi split into more than ten rays and turned into more than ten immortal sword lights, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s fighting spirit was revealed. He held his long spear and went forward to fight against the sword radiance.</p><p>This sword-light was the same as the chief sovereign’s origin divine power. When used to attack, one would be able to comprehend origin divine power even faster.</p><p>Just like that, three months passed. Lu Ming’s understanding of the inextinguishable sword force increased rapidly, especially in the early stages. The speed of improvement was even faster.</p><p>Nine months later, Lu Ming had cultivated the inextinguishable sword force to 99%.</p><p>However, it was very difficult to break through here. After that, Lu Ming spent another three months but his inextinguishable sword force still did not break through. He did not successfully awaken the divine power factor.</p><p>“What a pity, there’s no time!”</p><p>On the stone platform, Lu Ming opened his eyes and sighed softly.</p><p>The three years were up!</p><p>If Lu Ming was given another half a year, he was confident that he could successfully awaken the divine power factor of the inextinguishable sword force. But now, he was still a little short.</p><p>When the light screen on Lu Ming’s body disappeared, a cold killing intent enveloped him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the three-year period is up. Let’s see how you die.”</p><p>A cold voice came from behind him. Lu Ming did not need to look to know that it was Jin Yuan.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw a few eyes filled with killing intent staring at him.</p><p>In the last year, Jin Yuan and the rest had been guarding the place to prevent Lu Ming from escaping in secret.</p><p>“The three-year period is up. What will Lu Ming do?”</p><p>Many people had the same thought. They stared at Lu Ming, wanting to see what he could do.</p><p>“How do I die? You think you can kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly, then stood up and left the stone platform. He walked towards Jin Yuan.</p><p>Many people were stunned. Lu Ming actually walked out just like that. His attitude was so arrogant, as if he did not care about Jin Yuan at all.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then come up and fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and soared into the sky. He stood high in the air, his body exuding a strong fighting spirit.</p><p>The others were even more stunned. This result was different from what they had imagined.</p><p>Lu Ming did not think of a way to escape nor did he beg for mercy. Instead … He challenged gold ingot!</p><p>Lu Ming actually challenged Jin Yuan. With his strength, he’ll only die if he challenges Jin Yuan!</p><p>“Could it be that he has also awakened the origin divine power factor?”</p><p>The crowd discussed spiritedly as they thought of this possibility.</p><p>“That’s impossible, right?”</p><p>Someone denied.</p><p>Lu Ming had only cultivated for three years and he had awakened the origin divine force factor. This talent was too monstrous. How could others live? many people chose not to believe it.</p><p>“You want to challenge me?”</p><p>Even Jin Yuan himself was slightly stunned. Then, his killing intent grew stronger. He soared into the sky and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; Jin Yuan’s entire body was enshrouded in dazzling golden divine power, and an ancient aura began to emanate from him.</p><p>A terrifying pressure pressed down on Lu Ming like a divine mountain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know that you’re quite powerful. However, you’re still far from being my match. Kneel down!”</p><p>die! Jin Yuan shouted. He reached out and pressed in the air. Golden light filled the air and a huge Golden Palm print was formed, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The sky rumbled. The palm print had not yet pressed down, but the violent Qi was already crushing Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>If it were any other ninth level heavenly God prodigies, no, even half-step divine kings, they might not be able to block this move.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s eyes were very calm. There was even a hint of anticipation in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>He was looking forward to clashing with the other geniuses who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. It was filled with an ancient aura. Then, a Spear’s gleam shot up into the sky, piercing through the clouds.</p><p>The huge spear radiance collided with Jin Yuan’s palm print, creating violent waves of power that swept in all directions.</p><p>The dazzling radiance illuminated the sky as if a planet had exploded.</p><p>In the next moment, the Spear’s gleam and the palm print disappeared at the same time. Lu Ming stood in the sky, motionless.</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>It took a long time for someone to react.</p><p>“The origin divine force factor. Oh my God, it’s the origin divine force factor. Lu Ming has also awakened the origin divine force factor!”</p><p>he has really awakened the origin divine power factor. This is impossible. How is this possible? ”</p><p>“Freak, freak!”</p><p>Many people were so excited that they couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>They had never expected that Lu Ming had also awakened the origin divine power factor. He had only cultivated for three years and was only at the fifth-level heavenly God Realm.</p><p>“Impossible, impossible, impossible …”</p><p>Jin Xing roared in his heart, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had fought with Lu Ming in the Qin heaven star system. However, he had not improved much yet, but Lu Ming had already awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>He was known as one of the four heroes of the Jin family. He had always been very confident in his talent. However, compared to Lu Ming, his talent was trash.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Jin Yuan was also extremely shocked. He looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>It was extremely rare for a fifth-level heavenly God to awaken the origin divine power. Jin Yuan had only heard that such a heaven-defying genius existed in the core regions of the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>It had to be known that the higher one’s cultivation was, the stronger one’s Shen power would be and the deeper one’s understanding of Shen power would be. It would be easier to awaken the origin Shen power factor.</p><p>The lower one’s cultivation level, the more difficult it was.</p><p>In the universal camp, anyone who had awakened the origin divine power factor below God King would be considered a one in a million Supreme prodigy. However, the majority of those who had awakened their origin divine power were at the half-step God King realm.</p><p>In history, the number of ninth level heavenly deities awakening was extremely, extremely rare.</p><p>Let alone a fifth level heavenly deity.</p><p>“Is it very impressive to awaken the origin divine force factor?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly. His words were in response to Jin Yuan’s earlier words.</p><p>Jin Yuan had been acting all high and mighty just now, looking down on people who had not awakened the divine power factor. Lu Ming’s words made Jin Yuan’s face turn gloomy.</p><p>you’re only a fifth level celestial deity. Even if you’ve awakened, your power is limited. Today, I’ll kill you!</p><p>kill! Jin Yuan shouted, and the killing intent on his body became even stronger.</p><p>The more talented Lu Ming was, the more he had to kill him.</p><p>BOOM! Jin Yuan stepped out. His palm was like a knife as he slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Void severing hand!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
