He glared at Lu Ming furiously and roared, ” kid, I’ll let you experience my God-destroying light. It’s your honor to die under it!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the middle-aged man turned into a ray of divine light and rushed toward Lu Ming, enveloping him in the divine light.</p><p>As soon as he was enveloped by this divine light, Lu Ming’s hair stood on end. He felt a great sense of danger.</p><p>Indeed, the next moment, Lu Ming felt a sharp pain in his body.</p><p>This light seemed to want to melt his body.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. His divine power erupted and he cast the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor to cover his entire body to resist the divine light.</p><p>However, the nine-layer Crimson Gold armor was useless.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The nine-layer Scarlet Gold armor let out a sizzling sound when it was enveloped by this divine light. It was as if ice and snow had met fire and was constantly melting.</p><p>“Kid, you can control so many kinds of Shen power? Wonderful, truly wonderful!”</p><p>The stone eyeball’s voice was heard again, full of surprise.</p><p>It was obvious that the other party did not know of the existence of such a wondrous cultivation technique like the heaven and earth thousand Dao Scripture.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming was not in the mood to think about it. He only wanted to block the divine light because it was too terrifying. It kept seeping into Lu Ming’s nine-layered Scarlet Gold armor and enveloped his body.</p><p>As soon as the divine light touched Lu Ming’s skin, he felt as if his body was being burned by flames. A piercing pain spread throughout his body.</p><p>To his horror, Lu Ming realized that wherever the divine light touched, his flesh and blood would melt like snow.</p><p>This scene was extremely terrifying.</p><p>If this went on, Lu Ming’s body would be melted by the divine light.</p><p>The other party called this divine light the God-destroying light. It was indeed terrifying.</p><p>The other party’s strength was already less than one-hundred-millionth of its peak, but it still had such shocking power.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He retracted the ice chain and wrapped it around his body, trying to block the God-destroying light attack with the ice chain.</p><p>However, the ice chains couldn’t resist the God-destroying light and quickly melted under it.</p><p>“Old Liang, do you have any way to absorb this divine light?”</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>it can’t be helped. This is the God-destroying light, and the other party is an ancient existence. His will is too strong. How can I absorb the power he cultivated? unless your realm is comparable to the other party, I can not exert a powerful force!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He pinned his hopes on the rock spirit again.</p><p>“Old man, do you have any ideas? this time, if you don’t make a move, I’m going to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the rock spirit.</p><p>I’m just an incomplete rock spirit. What can I do? besides, the opponent is the divine eye Lord. The God-destroying light of the divine eye Lord is one of the most terrifying forces in the world. Sigh, it seems that I’m so unlucky. I just recognized you as my master and you’re going to die. Sigh …</p><p>The rock spirit was sighing.</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood in anger.</p><p>It was fine that the old fellow did not help him, but he even cursed him. Lu Ming wanted to stomp on him.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>At that moment, more God-destroying light touched Lu Ming’s body. He realized that his flesh and blood were melting.</p><p>At this rate, it would not be long before Lu Ming was completely melted by the God-destroying light.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ming could not do anything about it.</p><p>hahaha, boy, you’re really My Lucky Star. You’ve brought me two ancient words of origin. Lucky chance, a great lucky chance!</p><p>The other party laughed, getting more and more excited.</p><p>Lu Ming was getting more and more anxious.</p><p>Could it be that he and Qiu Yue were going to die Here?</p><p>“Let’s go all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and decided to try burning the ancient God’s heart. It was better to take a risk than to die Here.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that even if he burned the ancient God’s heart, it might not be of any use. The other party’s God destroying light was too strange.</p><p>But he had to try.</p><p>However, before he burned the ancient God’s heart, Lu Ming wanted to take out the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had burned his ancient God’s heart and it was because of the purple-copper coffin that he was able to recover.</p><p>If the burning of the ancient God’s heart could deal with the stone eyeball, perhaps he could recover with the help of the purple bronze coffin?</p><p>He had to give it a try, right?</p><p>With a thought from Lu Ming, the purple copper coffin flew out of the shocking feather painting scroll.</p><p>However, just as the purple copper coffin flew out, a change suddenly occurred.</p><p>The purple bronze coffin suddenly shone brightly. It flew out from between Lu Ming’s eyebrows and floated above his head.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The lid of the purple copper coffin opened on its own, revealing a small gap.</p><p>An unimaginably terrifying aura seeped out from the gap in the coffin lid.</p><p>Compared to this aura, Lu Ming felt like dust.</p><p>No, even the most powerful Godking that Lu Ming had ever encountered was nothing but dust in the face of this aura.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to be able to see the battle of the ancient gods through the lid of the purple bronze coffin.</p><p>ah, ah, ah, how do you have this kind of thing, how do you have this kind of thing …</p><p>At this moment, the divine eye heavenly Lord suddenly shrieked with endless fear.</p><p>He seemed to have recognized the purple copper coffin.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The aura in the purple bronze coffin enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>The God-destroying light on Lu Ming’s body began to throb violently. Then, it left Lu Ming’s body and transformed into a figure again. It was the middle-aged man who called himself the divine eye Lord of heaven.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s face was filled with endless fear and disbelief.</p><p>“How could such a legendary thing appear on you? impossible, impossible!”</p><p>The divine eye heavenly Lord roared and tried to escape.</p><p>However, there seemed to be an attraction force inside the purple copper coffin that locked on to divine eye Lord of heaven. No matter how hard he struggled, it was useless. He was flying towards the gap of the purple copper coffin.</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>The divine eye heavenly Lord screamed in fear and struggled madly, but it was useless.</p><p>After a few breaths, the divine eye Lord was completely sucked into the purple copper coffin.</p><p>After absorbing the divine eye heavenly Lord, the purple copper coffin closed automatically. All the aura disappeared, and the purple copper coffin returned to its original state.</p><p>Then, it actually fell down and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He quickly controlled the startled feather painting scroll to keep the purple copper coffin.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>This time, it was really dangerous. He didn’t expect that at the critical moment, the purple copper coffin would work and absorb the divine eye Lord.</p><p>Until now, Lu Ming was still in a daze. Everything had changed too quickly.</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming finally recovered and walked towards Qiu Yue.</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue shouted, ” “Collect!”</p><p>Then, the nine-colored divine light on Qiu Yue’s body shone brightly and enveloped the stone eyeball. The stone eyeball started to shrink and flew towards Qiu Yue’s body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
