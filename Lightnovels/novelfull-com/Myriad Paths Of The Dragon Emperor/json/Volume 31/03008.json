Is this really fate? ”</p><p>The absolute beauty murmured, her eyes somewhat complicated.</p><p>At this moment, the layer of ice covering her body was even thicker. Her eyes were a little dazed and her vitality was getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>The Vine’s head was huge. Lu Ming rushed into its mouth and realized that it was empty inside.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming released a powerful aura and wanted to kill the vine.</p><p>However, from all directions, endless cold air enveloped Lu Ming, trying to freeze him to death.</p><p>This kind of cold Qi was extremely terrifying. It was condensed by the gem on the Vine’s head. If it were anyone else, even if they had the cultivation of the absolute beauty, they would probably be frozen to death.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the measure formula.</p><p>The ” measure ” formula glowed and a mysterious energy covered Lu Ming’s body. The terrifying cold air would be devoured and absorbed by the ” measure ” formula as soon as it got close to Lu Ming. Lu Ming was not affected at all.</p><p>“Lu Ming, wait a minute. It’s useless for you to attack like this. It’s hard to kill it completely without hitting its core!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>core? where is the core of this vine? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>this vine is not an ordinary plant. It is born from extreme cold Qi, so it must have a core. I can sense it. Move forward!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>The Vine’s head was a few thousand meters long and wide. It was very large. Lu Ming flew a few hundred meters and saw that there were many fine vines above it. They were wrapped around a crystal core the size of a human head and were connected to each other.</p><p>“That’s the core of the vine. As long as you break it, the vine will die!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming was about to launch an attack.</p><p>At this moment, the vine seemed to sense the impending danger. It frantically gathered the cold air and rushed towards Lu Ming like a storm.</p><p>Even an ordinary first-tier Divine King would be frozen to death by such cold air. However, Lu Ming was not affected at all.</p><p>The cold Qi was absorbed by the ” quantity ” formula and could be used to adjust the energy in the core of the star.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power and shot out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance struck the crystal core, causing it to shake violently before exploding.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>Si si si …</p><p>The vine let out all kinds of ear-piercing cries, and its huge body scurried around. Finally, it fell to the ground with a loud bang, motionless, and completely breathless.</p><p>“Die … He’s dead?”</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s eyes revealed surprise.</p><p>However, her current condition was getting worse and worse, and she was about to fall into a coma.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Vine’s head exploded and Lu Ming appeared on top of it. He swept his gaze across the area and frowned when he saw the state of the absolute beauty.</p><p>“Should I save him or not?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>According to Lu Ming’s character, he did not want to save her because this woman had been hunting him down. Since she was an enemy, Lu Ming would definitely not show mercy.</p><p>However, this woman had saved him twice.</p><p>Previously, he had faced the white-haired youth. Now, he was facing the vines.</p><p>No matter what the other party’s purpose was, he had indeed saved him. Especially this time, in order to save him, he had sacrificed himself.</p><p>“Save him!”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He had his own principles.</p><p>Since the other party had saved him, he had to return the favor.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and arrived beside the beautiful woman.</p><p>this woman has been hit by that vine. The cold has already attacked her heart. In at most ten minutes, she will be completely frozen to death!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and sized up the beautiful woman carefully.</p><p>To be honest, this absolute beauty was really beautiful.</p><p>The clothes on her body were slightly torn by the vines, revealing a large area of her snow-white skin.</p><p>In addition, he was motionless at the moment and looked like he was at the mercy of others. Lu Ming’s heart wavered when he saw this.</p><p>“You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>The beautiful woman said nervously, but her voice was weak.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled evilly.</p><p>This smile made the woman’s face turn even paler and filled her with despair.</p><p>“I’ll ask you some questions. If you can answer them, I’ll consider letting you go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What do you want to ask? Go ahead and ask!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>“Why do you want to kill me? And why did you save me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>This was what he was most curious about.</p><p>The absolute beauty gritted her teeth, seemingly unwilling to say.</p><p>“You’re not going to tell me, right? if you don’t, then don’t blame me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled evilly and touched the beautiful woman’s face. The touch was extremely cold. A terrifying chill rushed toward Lu Ming’s palm. Lu Ming circulated his divine power to dispel it.</p><p>“Stop, stop, I’ll talk, I’ll talk …”</p><p>The absolute beauty said in a panic.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the other party and did not say a word, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>“Because if I don’t kill you, I’ll marry you. If I don’t want to marry you, I’ll have to kill you!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>“What? What?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded. He thought that he had heard wrongly.</p><p>“You want to marry me? Beauty, we’ve never met before. Why do you want to marry me?”</p><p>Lu Ming was really dumbfounded.</p><p>“Are you Prince Jing Yu’s successor?”</p><p>The absolute beauty suddenly said.</p><p>Lu Ming was so shocked that he almost jumped.</p><p>How did the other party know that Lu Ming was the successor of Jingyu? he did not tell anyone about this.</p><p>“How did you know?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>This matter could not be leaked out.</p><p>Jing Yu had been framed back then, and he had a terrifying enemy in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>If the secret that he was startled feathers ‘inheritor were to be revealed, he would most likely be killed.</p><p>“My father told me!”</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>“Your father?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart turned cold. Could it be that he had been exposed?</p><p>my father is in the universal camp. When you were fighting with the others in the universal camp, my father happened to pass by and he saw through you!</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>“Your father?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his mind spinning rapidly.</p><p>Other than fighting with frigid Eagle in the universal camp, he had not fought at all. Could it be that he had been recognized at that time?</p><p>“Who is your father? How did you recognize me? And what does this have to do with you marrying me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a few questions in succession.</p><p>my father was Prince Jingyu’s teacher back then. He followed Prince Jingyu for countless years, so it’s only natural that my father would be able to recognize his successor!</p><p>The absolute beauty said.</p><p>Jingyu’s teacher? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly stunned. This was really beyond his expectations.</p><p>my father is proficient in the art of numerancy. He predicted that Prince Jingyu’s successor was about to be born. Furthermore, he swore an oath that he would marry his daughter, me, to the successor of Prince Jingyu!</p><p>my father believed that Prince Jingyu was framed. He wanted me to help Prince Jingyu’s successor find out the truth!</p><p>The absolute beauty continued.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
