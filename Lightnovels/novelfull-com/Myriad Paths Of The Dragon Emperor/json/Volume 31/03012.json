I can quickly refine a portion of the energy.</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Alright, then you can absorb it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the ” measure ” formula flew out. It shone at the utmost cold gem and the gem disappeared, being absorbed by the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>After the ‘quantity’ formula was absorbed, it flew back to Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness. It quieted down and began to refine the energy.</p><p>Lu Ming sized him up.</p><p>First, his gaze fell on the nine vines of the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>The myriad rivers ice vine was born naturally. It could be said that its entire body was a treasure.</p><p>Lu Ming was especially envious of the nine vines. He had witnessed the power of the nine vines in the previous battle. Not only were they extremely tough, but they were also filled with a terrifying chill.</p><p>If the nine vines were to be refined into the ice shackles, wouldn’t the power of the ice shackles increase greatly?</p><p>The power of the ice shackles was not bad, but it also had a weakness, and that was its fragility. Against cultivators of the same level, or even one, two, or three levels higher, it was still effective.</p><p>However, the enemies that Lu Ming was facing were usually four to five levels higher than him, or even more. The ice chains were easily broken.</p><p>However, if he refined this kind of rattan, the weakness of the ice shackles would disappear, and its power would definitely increase.</p><p>He did as he said!</p><p>However, there was a problem that gave Lu Ming a headache. How could he cut the rattan?</p><p>Lu Ming walked around the corpse of the myriad rivers ice vine and his eyes lit up. He took out a combat sword and started slashing at the place where the vine and the root of the head were connected.</p><p>The myriad rivers ice Vine’s head was not that hard. Very soon, Lu Ming removed one of the vines.</p><p>“It’s so heavy!”</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the rattan and waved it slightly. As the rattan waved, it pierced through the air and made a terrifying whistling sound. It was extremely heavy and there was a cold air that drilled into Lu Ming’s arm.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>The more mysterious the vine was, the greater the benefits.</p><p>Lu Ming immediately sat down cross-legged and with a thought, an ice chain flew out.</p><p>This ice chain had been refined into a ball of cold liquid and it was the most powerful. Lu Ming had to first refine the rattan into this ice chain.</p><p>&Nbsp; he used the ice chain secret technique, and the ice chains wriggled and merged with the vines. Then, he started to refine them.</p><p>Of course, this kind of rattan was extremely tough. It was not easy to refine it. Lu Ming spent half a month to completely refine the rattan and integrate it into the ice chains.</p><p>With a thought, the ice chains danced like long snakes.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>The ice chains whipped in the air, erupting with a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ice chain struck the ground, causing the ground to shake and gravel to fly everywhere. A ditch a few meters deep was created.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>One had to know that the ground here had been eroded by the cold nether energy for many years and had long been extremely hard. However, a whip from the ice chain had caused great damage, while the ice chain itself was not affected at all.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out a high-grade divine sword and slashed at the ice chains with all his might.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, and the divine sword hummed and vibrated non-stop. However, there was not a single mark on the ice chains.</p><p>Tough, it’s too tough. It has completely inherited the characteristics of the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>kid, that’s a good idea. The myriad rivers ice vine was born naturally and has endless potential. It was far from reaching its peak before. So, as long as you refine its vines into your secret skill, the power of your secret skill will continue to improve as your cultivation improves!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Old Liang, how’s the refining of the energy going?” Lu Ming looked delighted.</p><p>refining energy can’t be done overnight, but I’ve already refined a portion of it. I can transfer it to you now!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>let’s wait for a while. I’ll refine all the remaining vines first!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming continued to struggle. He cut off the remaining eight vines and refined them into his ice chains.</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the remaining ice chains were more difficult to fuse with the rattan. It also took a longer time.</p><p>Just like that, Lu Ming spent a whole year to refine the remaining eight vines and integrate them into the ice chains.</p><p>With a single thought, the nine ice chains danced in the air, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>With another thought, the nine ice chains disappeared without a trace.</p><p>He could use it freely!</p><p>in this case, my combat strength has increased a little!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>Now, the nine ice chains were extremely tough. They could be used to attack and defend. Ordinary people couldn’t break them at all.</p><p>This greatly increased Lu Ming’s life-saving energy.</p><p>“Old Liang, now, transfer the refined energy to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>Now, it was time to improve his cultivation.</p><p>“Alright, pay attention!”</p><p>The sound of the ” quantity ” formula was heard. Following that, a wave of dense and pure energy emerged.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to absorb this energy to cultivate.</p><p>This kind of energy was extremely pure. Lu Ming could easily refine it and transform it into his own divine power.</p><p>In his dantian, the divine fire formed by the five types of divine-grade divine power continued to grow.</p><p>Those five divine flames were originally equivalent to first-level heavenly deities. At this moment, they were rapidly approaching second-level heavenly deities.</p><p>A few days later, the flames of the five divine flames suddenly skyrocketed, successfully charging to second level celestial deity.</p><p>The upgrade continued.</p><p>Ten days later, the five divine flames assailed the third level celestial deity realm again.</p><p>This speed was extremely shocking.</p><p>This meant that Lu Ming was constantly breaking through and breaking through realms.</p><p>If he were to cultivate normally, he would definitely need to spend a lot of time. A few hundred years would be considered little, and a few thousand years or even ten thousand years would be considered normal.</p><p>This was the advantage of having the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>The five divine flames were still rising, continuously approaching the fourth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>However, when it rose to the peak of the third level celestial deity realm, it no longer had any energy.</p><p>The energy that emerged from the ” quantity ” formula had been completely refined.</p><p>“Is there any more?”</p><p>Lu Ming said to the quantity word formula with eager eyes.</p><p>“You should be satisfied to have so much energy in a year!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. However, after thinking about it, he felt that he should be satisfied.</p><p>If he didn’t have the extreme cold gem, even if he used the ” quantity ” formula to refine the energy of a star’s core, it would still take hundreds of years.</p><p>Now, he could achieve it in a year. Lu Ming should be satisfied.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
