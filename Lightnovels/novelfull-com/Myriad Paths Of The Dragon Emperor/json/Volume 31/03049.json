Why should she seek abuse?</p><p>Gritting her teeth, the woman left the platform and returned to the small path. The small path shrank back and disappeared.</p><p>“It’s easy!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>In front of the platform, there was a small path that extended out. Lu Ming continued to walk along the path.</p><p>But this time, there was a change.</p><p>After Lu Ming had walked for a while, the fog around him started to thin out. Slowly, the fog became lighter and lighter. Finally, the fog disappeared completely. The small path under his feet appeared in the void.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered because he saw other people in other directions.</p><p>In other directions, there were also small paths that extended out. On each path, there was a young genius.</p><p>“Jin Yuan, Chu baxing, Xu Yan, you han …”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across and saw many ‘familiar faces’.</p><p>Including him, there were ten people in total.</p><p>All of them were top-notch geniuses. Other than himself, the others had all awakened the origin divine power factor. They were also the strongest group of people who had entered.</p><p>There were originally three heaven’s favorites of this level from the residence of the nine Serenities Heavenly King. As Lu Ming had killed one of them, only two of them made it to this place.</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion had four people.</p><p>The nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, including Lu Ming, had four people.</p><p>They were Lu Ming, Jin Yuan, Xu Yan, and the young man in the animal skin coat.</p><p>Each of them had a small path under their feet, but the small path extended all the way here and stopped.</p><p>There was a high platform high above their heads that looked very ancient.</p><p>could it be that the life Soul Origin stone is up there? ”</p><p>A thought flashed through everyone’s mind, and their eyes revealed a fiery light.</p><p>At this time, a light flashed on the high platform, and a white-haired elder appeared. It was the formation spirit.</p><p>The formation Spirit’s gaze swept over everyone and said, ” “Alright, you are the last ten to arrive here!”</p><p>The final ten?</p><p>As soon as the formation Spirit’s words fell, the ten people’s eyes swept over each other, sizing each other up.</p><p>More people’s gazes fell on Lu Ming, revealing their surprise and shock.</p><p>“He can actually make it this far?”</p><p>“Strange!”</p><p>A few people whispered.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Chu BA Xing was also very surprised, his eyes flashing with a cold light.</p><p>“Why didn’t you Lian come here? Could he have been defeated?”</p><p>The two geniuses of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor started to talk.</p><p>“Who among these people can defeat you Lian?”</p><p>You Han’s eyes flickered as he glanced at the other geniuses. However, he ignored Lu Ming.</p><p>It was already a miracle that Lu Ming could make it this far. He did not believe that Lu Ming could still defeat you Lian. It was completely impossible.</p><p>He was mostly looking at Chu BA Xing, si Ji, and the others.</p><p>Only these few people had the possibility of defeating you Lian.</p><p>Different thoughts ran through everyone’s minds, while the formation spirit continued to speak.</p><p>“The life Soul Origin stone is right here!”</p><p>The formation spirit said. His words made the eyes of Lu Ming and the others light up even more.</p><p>Some people even tried to rush to the high platform above, but they found that there was a force in the void pressing down on them, making them unable to rush up at all.</p><p>don’t waste your energy. You won’t be able to get up here. If you want to get the life spirit primordial stone, you have to fight your way up step by step. Next, the ten of you will fight in pairs. Only the strongest will be able to step onto this high platform and get the life spirit primordial stone!</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>Everyone’s heart moved. As expected.</p><p>It seemed that he could only suppress the crowd today to get the treasure.</p><p>next, whichever path you choose will have to fight. However, I have to remind you that you can admit defeat before the battle, but once the battle begins, you can’t admit defeat. Only one of you will Live!</p><p>Towards the end, a cold killing intent flashed through the formation Spirit’s eyes.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p><p>Before the battle started, one could take the initiative to admit defeat, but once the battle started, only one of the two could live. This was a life-and-death battle, and the rules were very cruel.</p><p>so, you’d better think carefully before you start the war. Now, let’s begin!</p><p>The formation spirit said. As soon as he finished speaking, two of the paths began to extend and finally met in the air, turning into a huge battle stage.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the paragons on the two roads.</p><p>One of them was a genius from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion, and the other was a genius from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Haha, come!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion moved and landed on the fighting ring. He looked down at the heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion and said, ” kid, come up. I want your soul!</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion looked grave.</p><p>Among these people, the one he didn’t want to meet the most was the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor.</p><p>The attacks of the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor were too strange.</p><p>“You, do you want to fight or not?”</p><p>The formation spirit looked at the heaven’s favorites from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion and asked.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>In the end, the heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted and stepped out, appearing on the fighting ring.</p><p>As a saber wielder, he had enough confidence in himself. A saber wielder would show off their abilities and would never retreat. Moreover, he did not believe that all the geniuses of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor were as strong as you han.</p><p>As soon as the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion landed on the fighting ring, it began to light up. A light shield covered the fighting ring.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>The formation spirit announced.</p><p>“Brat, die! Hahaha!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion laughed hideously. His body flashed like a ghost, and he attacked the heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>three blades of the netherworld, heaven netherworld!</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion shouted coldly and unsheathed his saber. He slashed several times in a row, and several yellow saber lights shot up to the sky, slashing toward the heaven’s favorite of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion. The power was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion displayed his powerful strength as soon as he made his move. Several saber lights enveloped the Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion, covering all his vital parts.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion said coldly. His body was like a ghost’s shadow, flashing continuously. In an instant, he dodged a few blade lights and continued to rush toward his opponent.</p><p>“Nine nether ghostclaw!”</p><p>A ghostly claw formed and grabbed at the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon at an amazing speed.</p><p>“Wall of blades!”</p><p>The genius from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion roared and shook his battle blade. Instantly, endless blade light shot out, forming a blade wall that was completely condensed from blade light.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The nine nether ghostly claw of the nine nether Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon grabbed the wall of sabers, causing it to shake violently. A strange force directly passed through the wall of sabers and rushed into the body of the Paragon of the nine nether Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion trembled, and his aura weakened. The power of the wall of blades also weakened.</p><p>The other’s nine nether ghostclaw took advantage of the situation and broke through.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
