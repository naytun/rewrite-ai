It was extremely strange and could affect one’s soul.</p><p>It was obvious that the Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had his soul affected by this energy, causing his strength to be weakened instantly.</p><p>In a battle between experts, the slightest flaw was fatal.</p><p>The nine Serenities ghostly claw of the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon broke through the opponent’s wall of blades and clawed at the opponent.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon roared, and his divine power erupted like a volcano. He quickly retreated, but he was still a step too late. He was swept by the power of the nine nether ghostclaw, and a piece of flesh was torn off his body.</p><p>“Hehehe, you can’t run away, die!”</p><p>The Paragon of the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor sneered and continued to attack his opponent.</p><p>“Three blades of the netherworld, setting sun in the netherworld!”</p><p>die! the heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion roared as his body emitted a brilliant radiance. Then, all the radiance gathered towards his battle blade and he slashed out.</p><p>Then, a yellow sun appeared in the sky.</p><p>This sun was extremely bright. It was completely formed by the blade light. It emitted terrifying waves and charged toward the nine serenity Heavenly King Palace’s Paragon.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion finally looked serious. Wisps of mist emanated from his body, and the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves could be heard in the mist. It was as if countless vengeful spirits were wailing.</p><p>Then, in a flash, he pounced toward the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The saber radiance that was like a scorching sun descended, causing the void to tremble. The Paragon of the abysmal Heavenly King Manor’s figure flickered rapidly. In an instant, he flickered tens of thousands of times, deflecting a large amount of power.</p><p>At the same time, many of the countless vengeful souls around him were destroyed. However, this also helped to block a part of the power for the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon.</p><p>With this, the nine Serenities Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon closed in on the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon again, and the nine Serenities ghostly claw slashed out.</p><p>It was inevitable that the soul of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon was affected, and his momentum fell.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon shouted coldly and grabbed out.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Half of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon’s body was torn apart, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. It was a terrible sight.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion retreated with a scream. He was severely injured and his aura was weak.</p><p>His expression was extremely ugly as he retreated frantically.</p><p>However, the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon was clearly faster and was in hot pursuit.</p><p>the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion are dead!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>Although this genius from the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion was not as strong as you han, he was about as strong as you Lian. However, the genius from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion was probably slightly weaker than si Ji, so he was naturally not a match for him.</p><p>Now that he was injured, he was dead.</p><p>“I admit defeat!”</p><p>The paragons of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were terrified and rushed out of the fighting ring.</p><p>However, when he reached the edge of the fighting ring, he was blocked by the light shield. No matter how hard he attacked, he could not break it.</p><p>“Let me out! I admit defeat! I admit defeat!”</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion roared madly.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, before the battle, you can admit defeat. After the battle, we’ll fight to the death. Do you think my words are farts?”</p><p>The formation spirit said coldly.</p><p>“Hehehe, die!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the nine Serenities Heavenly King Palace sneered and attacked.</p><p>The nine blades Heavenly King mansion’s Paragon was in despair and fought back with all his might. However, he was severely injured at the moment, and his strength had been greatly reduced. What was the use of fighting with all his might?</p><p>After a few moves, a desperate scream was heard. The genius of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion had his head pierced.</p><p>Then, his soul was pulled out and it struggled madly.</p><p>The eyes of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor’s Paragon were filled with greed. He opened his mouth and swallowed the other party’s soul in one gulp, and the cry stopped abruptly.</p><p>Heavenly King ninedablade’s residence was a proud Son of Heaven. He was an existence that had awakened the origin divine power factor when he was only a half-step Divine King. Yet, he had fallen here, and even his soul had become food for others.</p><p>hehehe, it’s delicious. It’s really delicious. The soul of a peerless heaven’s favorite is indeed delicious and intoxicating!</p><p>The Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor let out a sharp cry.</p><p>The other people present all had ugly expressions.</p><p>The cultivation techniques and secret Arts that the people of the nine serenity Heavenly King’s residence cultivated were too strange. They were obviously of the same cultivation level, but they were often not the opponent’s match.</p><p>Everyone was considering how they would deal with the people from the nine serenity Heavenly King Manor if they were to encounter them.</p><p>The Paragon of the nine sabers Heavenly King mansion had fallen. His original path had disappeared and turned into nothingness. The Paragon of the nine serenity Heavenly King mansion had returned to his own path, and the battle stage in the sky had disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, the other two paths began to extend and meet in the air, forming a new fighting stage.</p><p>“It’s my turn now, but what a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>This time, one of the two paths was his, and the other was actually gold ingot’s.</p><p>He met Jin Yuan again.</p><p>Seeing that his opponent was Lu Ming, Jin Yuan’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>The others ‘gazes fell on Jin Yuan and Lu Ming.</p><p>gold ingot this fellow’s luck is pretty good, to actually encounter this fifth level celestial deity trash. A wasted win!</p><p>Chu BA Xing muttered, revealing a faint look of disdain.</p><p>You han, si Ji, and the rest had similar thoughts. They reckoned that Lu Ming would admit defeat immediately.</p><p>But in the next moment, their eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming had taken a step forward and landed on the fighting ring.</p><p>“He actually dared to accept the challenge?”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Once the battle started, it would be a life-and-death battle. Lu Ming actually dared to engage in a life-and-death battle with Jin Yuan?</p><p>However, what surprised them even more was that Jin Yuan stood on the path and did not step onto the fighting ring.</p><p>gold ingot, do you want to fight or not? quickly decide. Don’t waste time here!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jin Yuan and said coldly.</p><p>“Before the battle begins, you can admit defeat!”</p><p>The formation spirit added.</p><p>Gold ingot’s expression was unsightly, and his eyes flickered. After a while, he finally gritted his teeth and said,”I admit defeat!”</p><p>Jin Yuan admitted defeat.</p><p>Prior to this, he had fought Lu Ming once at myriad God cliff. In the end, he was defeated by Lu Ming and had to escape in a sorry state.</p><p>He was not Lu Ming’s match last time. In this battle, he would still not be Lu Ming’s match. Was he not courting death in a life-and-death battle? Of course he had to admit defeat.</p><p>However, the others were all stunned. They looked at Jin Yuan in confusion.</p><p>Jin Yuan actually admitted defeat. He admitted defeat to a fifth level heavenly deity?</p><p>If Jin Yuan had admitted defeat to people like you han and Chu baxing, it would not be strange. But now, he actually admitted defeat to a fifth level celestial deity?</p><p>They really couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>Even Xu Yan and the young man in the animal skin coat, who were also from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, were surprised. They couldn’t figure out what trick Jin Yuan was playing.</p><p>“Hahaha, gold ingot, you’re really trash. You actually don’t even dare to fight a fifth level celestial deity and admit defeat directly. Trash, you’re trash!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing laughed out loud, his voice filled with ridicule.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
