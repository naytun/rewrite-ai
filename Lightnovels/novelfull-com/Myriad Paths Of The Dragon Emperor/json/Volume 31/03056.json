BOOM!</p><p>You han continuously attacked the ice chains at the side, but it was completely useless. On the contrary, the terrifying chill of the ice chains almost froze his body, causing his speed to decrease.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it …”</p><p>You han was truly panicking as he roared in anger. He no longer had the confidence he had before.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and cast the supernova, blasting it at you han.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A destructive power swept towards you han.</p><p>You han wanted to Dodge, but he was surrounded by ice chains. How could he Dodge? the terrifying destructive power kept bombarding his body.</p><p>Green smoke rose from his body, and a large number of ghostly figures turned to dust under the destructive energy.</p><p>After one move, you Han’s aura weakened.</p><p>In a situation where he couldn’t Dodge, he wasn’t even as good as Chu BA Xing, suffering heavy injuries in a single move.</p><p>“No, no…”</p><p>You han was completely flustered. He kept shouting as he tried to retreat. With a few flashes, he dodged some of the ice chains. Unfortunately, the light shield of the fighting stage was behind him.</p><p>He crashed into the light barrier and was blocked by it.</p><p>His face was filled with even more despair.</p><p>If it was outside, even if Lu Ming had the ice chain, he would not be able to do anything to him. He could not win but he could always escape. However, the space here was too small. He could not escape at all.</p><p>senior, senior, let me out. I don’t want the life Soul Origin stone anymore. Let me out!</p><p>You han continued to roar.</p><p>However, the formation Spirit’s expression was cold, and it was unmoved.</p><p>You han revealed a look of despair.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Another deep sound rang out, and then a destructive power drowned you han.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>You Han’s body exploded and turned into ghostly shadows. More than half of the ghostly shadows were destroyed by the destructive power, while the remaining half wriggled and tried to merge back together.</p><p>However, Lu Ming struck again. The destructive energy completely drowned you han.</p><p>You han let out a cry of despair. This time, all the ghostly figures were destroyed.</p><p>You han had also completely fallen.</p><p>Another Paragon was killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, it was much easier to kill you han than to kill Chu baxing. It was completely one-sided.</p><p>The main reason was that you Han’s various advantages and techniques were completely ineffective against Lu Ming.</p><p>In this relatively narrow environment, you han was restrained by Lu Ming. He could not Dodge even if he wanted to and was easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“This Lu Ming must be eliminated!”</p><p>Gold ingot muttered, killing intent flickering in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>He was thinking about how to borrow the Jin family’s power to get rid of Lu Ming after he left star-moon ancient city.</p><p>brat, you killed a heaven’s favorite of my nine serenity Heavenly King Manor. I’ll remember this debt!</p><p>The last heaven’s favorite from the abysmal Heavenly King mansion said coldly. He looked at Lu Ming with eyes full of killing intent.</p><p>The others also had different thoughts.</p><p>“If you’re not afraid of death, then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied indifferently and ignored them.</p><p>alright, the final Victor has been born. The life soul vitality stone already has an owner. Everyone else, you can go back!</p><p>The formation spirit said. After it finished speaking, it waved its hand, and the path under Xu Yan, Jin Yuan, and the others ‘feet quickly shrank back, disappearing into the chaotic mist.</p><p>Lu Ming was the only one left at the scene.</p><p>“Come on up!”</p><p>The array spirit waved its hand again and the path under Lu Ming’s feet extended all the way to the high platform where the array spirit was.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and finally walked onto the high platform.</p><p>On the high platform, there was nothing else but an altar.</p><p>The altar looked very old and was filled with the aura of time.</p><p>Above the altar, there was a black ball floating.</p><p>is this a life Soul Origin stone? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the ball, which was shining with a fiery light.</p><p>In the early days of the heavenly Palace era, the life soul vitality stone was guarded by so many powerful existences. Along the way, there were many barriers to protect it. How mysterious was it?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Senior, is this a life Soul Origin stone?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked the array spirit.</p><p>that’s right, this is the life soul primordial stone. It’s yours now. You just need to drip a drop of blood on it and you can keep the life soul primordial stone.</p><p>The formation spirit said with a smile.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and stepped forward to the altar. He forced out a drop of blood and dripped it on the black life soul primordial stone.</p><p>Instantly, a wisp of black light appeared on the life Soul Origin stone. With a flash, the drop of blood was absorbed by the life Soul Origin stone.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to have established a connection with the life soul meta stone. It was as if Lu Ming could control the life soul meta stone at will.</p><p>With a single thought, the life soul vitality stone on the altar flew up and turned into a ray of light. It flew into Lu Ming’s glabella and disappeared. The next moment, the life soul vitality stone appeared in Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness and floated there quietly.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled. The life soul vitality stone appeared in his palm.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power and poured it into the life soul primordial stone. However, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. There was no reaction at all.</p><p>“Senior, how do I use this life soul vitality stone? What’s its use?”</p><p>Lu Ming consulted the array spirit.</p><p>“It’s useless!”</p><p>The formation spirit lightly replied with three words.</p><p>Lu Ming staggered and almost fell.</p><p>What? No effect?</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the array spirit with an ugly expression and said,”Senior, what do you mean by useless?”</p><p>“It’s useless, don’t you understand?”</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. He was really speechless.</p><p>He had fought his way up and risked his life, but in the end, what he got was a piece of scrap metal?</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood.</p><p>F * ck, this was a f * ck.</p><p>However, if it was useless, why would so many people protect it?</p><p>“Little guy, don’t be discouraged. I said it was useless because the life soul vitality stone you obtained was only a fragment!“</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>a fragment? this isn’t complete? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked, feeling speechless.</p><p>that’s right. This is not a complete life spirit origin stone. It’s only a fragment. The other fragments are scattered all over the place. I don’t know where they are.</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>“What’s the use of a fragment?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed, still brooding over it.</p><p>“Little rascal, don’t underestimate this piece. It’s a piece of life soul and original stone. At the beginning of the heaven Palace era, no, even the incipient God Realm, it was a rare treasure. It has a great function. Do you know that?”</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
