This scene had almost scared Yi Xiang to death.</p><p>“Attack! All of you attack together and kill this brat!”</p><p>Yi Xiang roared.</p><p>“This kid is evil, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Said the third level Godking expert from the Jin clan.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The third level Godking realm experts of the winged man race and the Qin family experts attacked at the same time, exuding a shocking aura.</p><p>The three third level Divine King experts attacked together with an earth-shaking momentum.</p><p>Originally, there were some people watching at the side, but now they kept retreating, afraid of being affected.</p><p>.com</p><p>“Someone, someone come quickly!”</p><p>At this moment, Yi Xiang shouted into the distance.</p><p>He did not know why, but he was still feeling very uncertain. The main reason was that Lu Ming had brought too much fear to him. Even with the three third tier Godking experts protecting him, he was still not confident.</p><p>He knew that there were definitely experts from the three great clans guarding the area, or even stronger experts.</p><p>These people were there just in case. In the plan, they didn’t need to make a move.</p><p>To deal with a heavenly God, it was already too much to send a God King. If they sent someone even stronger, they would be laughed at.</p><p>But now, Yi Xiang only felt extremely flustered and hoped to call more experts.</p><p>“Void severing hand!”</p><p>“Seven injury divine fist!”</p><p>“Thunder slash!”</p><p>As Yi Xiang roared, the three experts attacked at the same time. Three unique skills were launched at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the face of such an attack, even an ordinary second-stage Divine King would definitely be beaten to a pulp, let alone Lu Ming who was just a small divine realm expert.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had QiuQiu.</p><p>“I’m going to explode!”</p><p>QiuQiu shouted.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and threw a punch.</p><p>Squeak …</p><p>Terrifying lightning emanated from QiuQiu’s body. The infinite power of lightning transformed into three Thunder sabers and slashed at the three of them.</p><p>This was QiuQiu’s ultimate move, and QiuQiu had already used all its strength.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There were three consecutive explosions, and then a few screams.</p><p>Then, the three figures retreated.</p><p>Two of the figures fell to the ground after being pushed back. Their bodies were black and they had no aura.</p><p>He was dead!</p><p>Two of them were killed by QiuQiu.</p><p>These two people were the experts of the Jin family and the Qin family.</p><p>QiuQiu used its full strength and erupted with all the power of lightning. That kind of lightning was truly too terrifying. It killed two third firmament Godking existences in one fell swoop.</p><p>Only the Godking of the winged man race survived.</p><p>However, he was in a terrible state as well. As the Godking of the winged man race also controlled lightning, his resistance to lightning was slightly stronger. Even though he did not die, his body was charred black like a piece of charcoal. At the same time, he spat out large mouthfuls of blood and his aura was extremely weak. He was half-dead.</p><p>“I … I …”</p><p>This time, Yi Xiang was so scared that he almost peed his pants. His face was deathly pale and his body was trembling non-stop.</p><p>“This time, let’s see who else will come to save you!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and came to Yi Xiang’s side. He stretched out his hand and grabbed at Yi Xiang.</p><p>“No, father, father, save me!”</p><p>Yi Xiang cried out hysterically.</p><p>“Let go of my young master!”</p><p>At this moment, a long howl was heard from not far away. This howl pierced through the sky and shook the entire soaring cloud region. Then, a figure rushed over at a terrifying speed.</p><p>The figure had yet to arrive, but a terrifying aura had already rushed over like a wave.</p><p>This aura was several times more terrifying than a third level Godking.</p><p>When Yi Xiang shouted earlier, the experts who were guarding the area had indeed rushed over.</p><p>there are still experts, but it’s too late!</p><p>A cold glint flashed across Lu Ming’s eyes. He grabbed down with his large hand and a violent force crushed Yi Xiang. Yi Xiang only let out a pained cry of unwillingness before he was turned into ashes by Lu Ming’s large hand.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>The person who had rushed over let out a terrifying roar. A terrifying blade with the power of lightning slashed at Lu Ming, trying to kill him.</p><p>The person who rushed over was an expert from the winged men’s family. He had rushed over immediately when he heard Yi Xiang’s cry, but he was still a step too slow. He could only watch as Yi Xiang was killed. He wanted nothing more than to grind Lu Ming’s bones into dust.</p><p>what a terrifying power. He should be at the fourth level of the divine King realm!</p><p>Lu Ming could feel the other party’s power. He deeply understood that his current ability was far from that of such an expert.</p><p>QiuQiu’s body wriggled rapidly. In the end, it turned into an armor that covered Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming and QiuQiu used all their strength to launch a move to block the other party’s attack.</p><p>With a terrifying boom, Lu Ming’s body was sent flying like a cannonball. He flew for hundreds of miles and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The armor that QiuQiu had transformed into began to crack.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if his body was about to split open. His body was covered in hideous wounds and blood was flowing out continuously.</p><p>If it wasn’t for QiuQiu’s protection just now, he definitely wouldn’t have been left with even dregs.</p><p>However, even with QiuQiu’s protection, QiuQiu’s cultivation was only at the second level of the divine King realm. It could kill a third level Divine King, but it was still not enough to fight a fourth level Divine King. The other party broke QiuQiu’s defense with one move.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A thin old man appeared in the air in front of him.</p><p>This old man had a pair of Lightning Wings on his back, so he was naturally an expert from the winged men’s family.</p><p>At this moment, his body was trembling slightly because of his anger. His body was filled with a shocking killing intent as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You killed my young master, die, die!”</p><p>The winged man elder roared and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>However, at this moment, a figure rushed over from behind Lu Ming at an equally shocking speed. Lu Ming only felt a strong wind flash before a figure appeared in front of him. The figure struck out with a palm and exchanged a blow with the elder of the winged man race.</p><p>In the sky, it was as if a planet had exploded. Energy spilled in all directions. The winged man Tribe elder’s body flew backward while the figure in front of Lu Ming took a few steps back.</p><p>“Wu family, you want to protect this kid!”</p><p>After the winged man elder steadied himself, he roared and glared at the figure in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>The person who suddenly appeared in front of Lu Ming was an expert from the Wu family.</p><p>“Young master Lu Ming, I’ll definitely protect you!”</p><p>The Wu family’s expert said firmly.</p><p>“Can you protect them all by yourself?”</p><p>A cold voice came from not far away. Then, many figures rushed over from all directions.</p><p>There were at least a dozen silhouettes. They were all middle-aged men or old men. Each of them had a terrifyingly profound aura. They were all experts at the fourth level of Divine King realm or above.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the crowd and discovered that there were people from the Jin family, the Qin family, and the winged men race.</p><p>“Hehe, you three great aristocratic families really think highly of me. In order to kill me, not only did you use soaring wing as bait, but you also sent so many experts. Lu Ming is truly honored.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard.</p><p>In the surroundings, many people who were watching came to a realization and roughly understood what had happened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
