Young master sky Mantis was forced back, and a white mark appeared on his body.</p><p>After a series of collisions, Lu Ming finally found an opportunity and stabbed young master sky Mantis with his spear.</p><p>“What a thick shell!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Just now, he had stabbed young master sky Mantis with his spear, but he had failed to break his outer shell.</p><p>“Hahaha, you can’t break my defense. Only I can kill you, do you understand?”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis laughed. He stomped on the air with his hind legs again, and the air exploded. With a whoosh, he charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In the process of charging forward, young master sky Mantis kicked his back foot again, increasing his speed to the maximum. He appeared on Lu Ming’s right side in an instant and slashed at Lu Ming several times.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear swept out and blocked young master sky Mantis ‘attack. However, young master sky Mantis stomped on the ground again and appeared on the other side, launching an attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis’s back foot stepped in the air, making his speed astonishingly fast. He constantly flickered around Lu Ming and launched attacks. It was as if there were knife lights slashing at Lu Ming from all directions.</p><p>With a single thought, the ice chains wrapped around Lu Ming. The saber beams slashed at the ice chains, producing clanking sounds. However, they were ultimately blocked by the ice chains.</p><p>“It seems that you can’t break my defense either!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Is that so? you think you can defend against me? break!”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis roared. He kept slashing at Lu Ming with his front claws, hitting the ice chains. The ice chains trembled, and a gap appeared on them.</p><p>However, he still managed to block young master sky Mantis’s attack.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was very powerful. His overall combat power was no less than gold ingot’s. However, in terms of single-target attack, he was still a little weaker than gold ingot’s void-breaking sword.</p><p>However, young master sky Mantis’s speed and defense were stronger than gold ingot’s. His overall combat strength was even a little stronger than gold ingot’s.</p><p>it’s my turn! Moon-slaying! Moon-slaying!</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His divine energy gushed out as if it was free. He continuously performed the moon-cutting move. The crescent-shaped Spear’s radiance slashed toward young master sky Mantis.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, the two of them clashed once again.</p><p>However, after Lu Ming’s three apocalyptic strikes had reached the eighth level, his strength had improved again compared to when he was fighting with Jin Yuan. In a head-on collision, he was still better than young master sky Mantis.</p><p>The sky rumbled, and young master sky mang’s body trembled. Like a cannonball, he fell to the ground and crashed heavily.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground rumbled and kept exploding. A huge pit with a radius of tens of thousands of miles appeared, and cracks covered the entire area.</p><p>This was still happening in star-moon ancient city. Everything in star-moon ancient city was tougher than the outside. If this had happened on a planet outside, the destructive power would have been far more than this.</p><p>&Nbsp; roar …</p><p>Seeing young master sky Mantis fall to the ground, the two wild beasts roared angrily. They stepped in the air and pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>These two wild beasts were extremely powerful. Although they were not as powerful as young master sky Mantis, they were still comparable to people like Qin Wukong.</p><p>“You two bastards, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He shot out two more times and two crescent-shaped spearlights slashed out.</p><p>These two moves were almost Lu Ming’s strongest attacks. How could the two dire beasts withstand them? He was directly split into two and died on the spot.</p><p>Then, the corpse of the wild beast fell, pulling the chariot and the dozen or so young men behind it, falling to the ground.</p><p>“Steady!”</p><p>stop! a young man shouted. He circulated his remaining divine power and barely managed to stabilize himself.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death! I want you dead!”</p><p>The ground exploded, and a figure rushed out. It was young master sky Mantis.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis had transformed into a Mantis. His expression was unclear, but his eyes were extremely cold.</p><p>In the process of soaring into the sky, he put his two front claws together. Then, his body began to spin rapidly, like a poisonous Dragon drill, drilling toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the void trembled violently, emitting lightning and flames. It was clear how shocking its power was.</p><p>“They’re going all out!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>Obviously, this was young master sky Mantis’s most powerful move, and it was also a desperate move.</p><p>“Then come!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath. The divine energy in his body rushed to his arm and then into the long spear.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming growled and thrust his long spear downward. A huge spear light burst out and pierced toward young master sky Mantis.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The moment the spear radiance collided with young master sky mang, it exploded. The terrifying destructive power rushed toward young master sky mang.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>Young master sky mang’s poisonous Dragon Claw kept colliding with the destructive power, cutting it and making ear-piercing sounds. But the next moment, young master sky mang’s spinning speed slowed down.</p><p>“Damn it …”</p><p>Young master sky Mantis roared in disbelief. Then, his body was sent flying by the destructive power. Once again, he fell to the ground like a meteor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Young master sky Mantis smashed into the ground for the second time. This time, the impact was even greater. The ground kept crumbling, and endless gravel and dust were sent hundreds of thousands of miles away by the shock wave.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, such terrifying combat strength …”</p><p>In the distance, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others swallowed their saliva when they saw this scene. They spoke with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>This level of strength had truly exceeded their imaginations.</p><p>If they had not experienced it for themselves, it was hard to imagine that Lu Ming still needed their help a few years ago when they had just entered star-moon ancient city.</p><p>Now, even the strongest Wu zixiong would be killed in seconds if he were to face Lu Ming.</p><p>no wonder Zifeng kept praising brother Lu Ming, saying that he was a rare genius and that one day, his name would shake the great void Holy dynasty. Now, it seems that he was not wrong at all!</p><p>Wuyue sighed.</p><p>it’s not just ‘but’. I’ve underestimated brother Lu Ming. In my opinion, I’m afraid that brother Lu Ming’s stage is not just the great void Holy dynasty!</p><p>Wu zixiong said.</p><p>The few of them sighed repeatedly, but Lu Ming’s attacks did not stop at all.</p><p>After he struck young master sky Mantis to the ground, Lu Ming swooped down like a bolt of lightning, rushing toward the place where young master sky Mantis had fallen.</p><p>He wanted to kill young master sky Mantis in one go.</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear was aimed at young master sky Mantis’s glabella.</p><p>Young master sky Mantis was lying in a pile of rocks, vomiting blood. When he saw Lu Ming charging at him, he quickly raised his two front claws to block the space between his eyebrows.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s long spear stabbed young master sky Mantis ‘front claws. It was as if he had stabbed several divine artifacts, producing a sound of metal colliding.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
