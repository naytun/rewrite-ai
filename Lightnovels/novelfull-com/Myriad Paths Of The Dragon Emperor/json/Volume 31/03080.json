His palm glowed as he used the void severing hand to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Their attacks collided once again.</p><p>This time, the waves of power were even more terrifying and swept in all directions.</p><p>Then, a figure retreated and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>This time, it was the godkings of the Jin clan who retreated.</p><p>The Godking of the Jin family was a first tier Godking. Although he was slightly stronger than the night Demon Lord, he was not that much stronger. Before Lu Ming transformed into the ancient God Body, he was at a slight disadvantage. Once he transformed, his combat power completely surpassed his opponent’s.</p><p>What?</p><p>.com</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>The abilities that Lu Ming had just displayed were already very terrifying. However, the abilities that Lu Ming had just displayed could only be described as shocking.</p><p>A single move had injured a Godking.</p><p>After Lu Ming injured his opponent, he continued to move forward. His violent aura swept towards Jin Yuan like a storm.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had improved greatly compared to when he was in star-moon ancient city. This made him envious, jealous, and hateful.</p><p>“Kill, kill him for me! Attack together!”</p><p>Gold ingot roared.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>attack! the burly men beside Jin Yuan all shouted and attacked together. Each of them exploded with a shocking aura.</p><p>All of them were at the first level of King God Realm.</p><p>Their bodies emitted a golden glow as they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>With a single thought, nine ice chains formed once again and flew forward, blocking the attacks of the few burly men from the Jin family.</p><p>A first level Godking wasn’t able to shatter the ice chains.</p><p>He used the ice chains to block the attacks of a few people. Then, Lu Ming focused on one person and killed him.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly and used almost all his strength to slash his spear at one of the burly men.</p><p>Lu Ming was now using all his strength to cast the moon slash. The power was shocking. It penetrated the burly man’s defense in an instant and split his body into two.</p><p>A Godking had fallen!</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ming had killed a Divine King expert with his own strength.</p><p>Back then, although Lu Ming had killed the night Demon King, it was a sneak attack by Lu Ming. Moreover, the night Demon King was killed by Lu Ming when it was seriously injured.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming was completely relying on his own ability to kill the other party.</p><p>How was that possible?</p><p>This scene shocked Jin Yuan and the others.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and his aura was wild. His long spear shook wildly and he slashed out continuously.</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming cast three moves of ‘moon cutting’. Three crescent-shaped spear gleams slashed at the three burly men.</p><p>Although the three men were prepared and tried their best to defend, they were still heavily injured. They were sent flying and coughed up blood.</p><p>For example, a person like Jin Yuan’s battle prowess was enough to battle a first level Godking. He could even gain the upper hand.</p><p>When Lu Ming was a fifth-level celestial deity, he could crush Jin Yuan and even defeat the stronger Chu baxing and the others.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had broken through to the sixth level celestial deity realm, his combat strength was much stronger than when he was in Starmoon ancient city. It was naturally easy for him to deal with an ordinary first level Divine King.</p><p>A few of the first level Godking realm guards were either killed or severely injured. Jin Yuan trembled in fear and quickly retreated.</p><p>“Gold ingot, die!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He took a step forward and his long spear pressed down with the force of Mount Tai.</p><p>what? ” Jin Yuan was shocked. Just as he was about to use all his strength to resist, a figure suddenly rushed in from the other side and stood in front of Jin Yuan. His body was filled with dazzling golden light.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The man struck out with his palm and hit the long spear. Lu Ming felt a powerful force surging from the long spear. His body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>“Second level of King God Realm!”</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The person who attacked later was also a burly man. Without a doubt, he was also an expert of the Jin family.</p><p>The Jin clan also had a second level Divine King realm expert mixed in the restaurant.</p><p>“Second level of King God Realm, hahaha, kill, quickly kill that kid!”</p><p>Jin Yuan screamed hysterically. He was so scared by Lu Ming that he almost peed his pants.</p><p>young master Jinyuan, don’t worry. He’s dead for sure today!</p><p>The expert of the Jin family said coldly. He was like a golden man, extremely dazzling.</p><p>The second level of the Godking realm was much stronger than the first level.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was capable of killing a first level Divine King, he was definitely not a match for a second level Divine King.</p><p>A second level Divine King against a first level Divine King would definitely be an instant kill without any suspense.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The second level Godking realm expert from the Jin clan took a step forward and charged at Lu Ming. He struck out a palm and a huge palm print was blasted at Lu Ming, causing the void to tremble.</p><p>It was the same void severing hand, but a second level Godking was much stronger than a first level Godking.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not Dodge. He moved and charged at the other party.</p><p>“He’s crazy!”</p><p>A thought flashed across many people’s minds. They thought that Lu Ming had gone crazy.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s combat strength, he was clearly no match for a second tier Divine King. Yet, he still dared to charge at his opponent. Was he not courting death?</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Jin Yuan’s eyes flashed with ferocity.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The second level Godking expert from the Jin clan exclaimed and increased the strength of his palm.</p><p>“QiuQiu!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted in a low voice.</p><p>Then, QiuQiu, which had turned into a bangle and was on Lu Ming’s wrist, moved.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>QiuQiu rushed out and turned into a ball. A tentacle stretched out of its round body and turned into a saber, slashing out.</p><p>The saber QiuQiu had transformed into slashed at the palm print of the Jin family expert. The palm print condensed by the Jin family expert was completely vulnerable and was cut in half like tofu.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>This scene shocked the experts of the Jin family. They were all dumbfounded.</p><p>His full-force Palm strike was extremely powerful, but it was easily broken by a metal ball.</p><p>His moment of shock had sealed his fate.</p><p>QiuQiu was like a bolt of lightning as it rushed toward the Jin clan expert, its saber continuing to slash down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Jin clan’s expert only let out a furious roar. He had just set up a layer of defense when he was cut by QiuQiu’s saber.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The Jin family expert’s defense was like paper. He was cut in half and died on the spot.</p><p>QiuQiu’s strength was extremely terrifying. Even at the divine King realm, it could kill enemies of a higher realm.</p><p>Now that QiuQiu had broken through to the second level of the divine King realm, killing someone on the same level as it was a piece of cake.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Seeing this, Jin Yuan was completely dumbfounded. His brain turned into mush, and he was completely stunned.</p><p>He had never thought that a second level Divine King expert of the Jin family would be killed just like that.</p><p>“Run, run …”</p><p>The next moment, he roared in his heart and wanted to retreat and escape.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming let him do as he wished?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge spear light pressed down on Jin Yuan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
