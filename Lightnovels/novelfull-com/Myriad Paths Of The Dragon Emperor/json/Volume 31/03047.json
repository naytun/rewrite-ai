He looked very old and was full of the aura of time.</p><p>He simply stood above the fog of chaos.</p><p>“It’s not a physical body!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts stirred. They could see that this old man was not made of flesh and blood, but of energy.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up as they tried to guess who this old man was. How could he have walked out of the fog? could it be that he was someone from star-moon ancient city who had not died?</p><p>Thinking of this, many people were shocked.</p><p>If that was the case, then this old man’s strength was terrifying.</p><p>“This old man is the formation spirit of this great formation!”</p><p>The old man’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>So it was the formation spirit!</p><p>Everyone’s hearts moved, and they heaved a sigh of relief. It wasn’t what they had imagined, a living expert.</p><p>However, the formation spirit was also very terrifying. It was no small matter that there was still a formation spirit left behind in a formation that had been set up so long ago.</p><p>“Senior, why is there no path here?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“There’s a path, but I’ve hidden it!”</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Because there are too many of you, and there are too few roads. It’s not enough to walk!”</p><p>The formation spirit said. After he finished speaking, he swept his gaze across the entire place and said,”You’re here for the life Soul Origin stone, right?”</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>They had indeed come for the life soul vitality stone. The life soul vitality stone that so many people were guarding was definitely a priceless treasure.</p><p>it seems like the others also know about the existence of the life Soul Origin stone through other channels!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he looked at Xu Yan and the rest.</p><p>This was because Xu Yan and the others weren’t the ones who had seen that scene in that secret chamber.</p><p>One could imagine that Xu Yan and the others had found out about the existence of life Soul Origin stones from other channels.</p><p>Perhaps everyone who entered this Castle would know of the existence of life soul vitality stones.</p><p>As expected, the old man began to explain.</p><p>in the distant past, there were people guarding every direction of this Castle. Now, these people are all dead, but their projections are left behind. Time flies, and so many years have passed. Since you can come here this time, it must be fate. It’s time for the life soul and vitality stone to be born!</p><p>The formation spirit sighed.</p><p>Everyone looked at the formation spirit and didn’t speak, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>“So this time, I’ll give you a chance!”</p><p>At this point, the formation spirit waved its hand, and the chaotic mist began to roil violently. Then, small paths appeared in the mist, extending into the depths of the mist, leading to an unknown place.</p><p>There were a total of 18 paths.</p><p>as long as you step on these paths and walk all the way to the end, the person who walks to the end will obtain a life soul vitality stone. However, after stepping on these paths, you will face a great battle with each other!</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>“Just the few of us?”</p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p>of course not. You’ve only come from one of the directions here. The people from the other directions are similar to you and will compete using this method. After you step on these paths and enter the chaotic fog, you’ll be able to meet them!</p><p>The formation spirit said.</p><p>“Also, only one person is allowed to enter each of these 18 paths!”</p><p>The formation spirit continued to speak. With a wave of its hand, eighteen round beads appeared in its hand, emitting a dazzling light.</p><p>these 18 beads are the travel passes. Only with the travel Pass can you walk on one of the paths. Those without the travel Pass will die Here!</p><p>Then, the true dragon waved his hand, and the eighteen round beads flew out in all directions.</p><p>“A Travel Pass?”</p><p>“I need a pass to go up and compete?”</p><p>“In other words, only 18 people can set foot on these paths?”</p><p>While many people were still digesting the information that the old man had just told them, the eighteen round beads had already flown over.</p><p>“I want one of these travel passes!”</p><p>Some of them reacted quickly and rushed towards one of the pearls.</p><p>“I also want one!”</p><p>“This one is mine!”</p><p>Immediately, the others reacted and rushed up to the sky, rushing towards the eighteen round beads.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The aura of the young man in animal hide was violent, like a wild beast. His body had an ancient aura. As soon as he attacked, he tore several young men apart and grabbed a round bead.</p><p>This was a heaven’s favorite who had awakened the origin source of divine power. No one dared to compete with him, and he became the first person to obtain the bead.</p><p>As for the other one, Xu Yan was also powerful, but his attacks weren’t as overbearing. He made a few young men spit out blood with a few punches, but he didn’t kill them.</p><p>He had also obtained a round bead.</p><p>Lu Ming moved as well. The moment the round beads flew out, he soared into the sky and rushed towards one of the round beads. He had cast the nine heavenly kun Peng technique and his speed was astonishing. Before the others could reach him, he had already caught one of the round beads in his hand.</p><p>“Release the travel passes!”</p><p>With a loud roar, one of the young men threw a palm at Lu Ming. The palm print whistled as if it could topple mountains and trample the seas.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He turned around and pulled his gun out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The huge spear radiance shattered the palm print and hit the other party’s body. The other party coughed out blood and retreated.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>However, there were a few young men who were charging at Lu Ming from a few other directions.</p><p>There were more than a thousand heaven’s favorites here, but there were only 18 round beads. Each of the beads was being fought over by a large number of people. One could imagine how intense the competition was.</p><p>“It seems like I won’t be able to suppress these people if I don’t use some tricks!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold. He activated the battle formula that quadrupled his combat strength and his aura skyrocketed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, Lu Ming stabbed more than ten times. More than ten spear gleams burst out and were extremely dazzling. Seven or eight young men who pounced at Lu Ming were pierced and sent flying far away. They spat out large mouthfuls of blood and their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Lu Ming had already shown mercy. Otherwise, these people would have been dead.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was so powerful, some of the people who wanted to fight for him gave up. After hesitating for a moment, they retreated and went to fight for the other round beads.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he flew toward one of the roads. He landed on one of the roads smoothly.</p><p>Xu Yan and the young man in the animal skin coat had landed on the path earlier than Lu Ming.</p><p>Out of the 18 Lu Ming’s, the three of them had taken three.</p><p>On the platform, the remaining people were fighting intensely for the remaining fifteen round beads. It was extremely tragic.</p><p>People were constantly being killed and dying here.</p><p>Finally, a powerful person managed to snatch a bead after a bloodbath and set foot on a path.</p><p>After a moment of killing, hundreds of heaven’s favorites have died. The 18 round beads all have owners.</p><p>Each of the 18 paths was occupied by a person.</p><p>alright, you can set off. Just follow this path and walk straight!</p><p>The formation spirit instructed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
