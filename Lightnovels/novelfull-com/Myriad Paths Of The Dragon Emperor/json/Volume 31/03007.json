The other vines flew over together, whistling through the air as they charged towards the absolute beauty.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>With a wave of her hand, the beautiful woman sent out beams of sword light that were as solid as glass. They slashed at the vines and sent them flying.</p><p>The absolute beauty was very powerful. If they were in the outside world, her strength would not be weaker than the vine.</p><p>But here, she was affected by the cold nether energy and couldn’t use her full strength.</p><p>“You crazy woman, what are you doing? Who needs your help?”</p><p>Lu Ming roared.</p><p>He was speechless. This crazy woman had wanted to kill him before, but now she wanted to save him. He really couldn’t figure out what this woman was thinking.</p><p>A woman’s heart was like a needle at the bottom of the ocean. This woman was the embodiment of it.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, even if you die, you can only die in my hands!”</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted coldly. She waved her sword, and beams of sword light slashed at the vines wrapped around Lu Ming’s body. She wanted to cut the vines apart and save Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the vines were tough and could not be split open.</p><p>woman, are you crazy? I don’t want you to save me.

If he was rescued, his plan would not be able to proceed.</p><p>Lu Ming really wanted to curse.</p><p>However, the absolute Beauty’s face darkened. She could not be bothered with Lu Ming and continued to attack.</p><p>However, she could not break the vines in the end. Lu Ming was getting closer and closer to the vines. He was almost in her mouth.</p><p>At this moment, a hint of ruthlessness flashed in the absolute Beauty’s eyes.</p><p>She suddenly abandoned Lu Ming and rushed toward the head of the vine.</p><p>She also understood that the only way to save Lu Ming was to attack the Vine’s head or even kill it.</p><p>“Godly Sword Art, kill!”</p><p>die! the beautiful woman shouted and slashed at the Vine’s head. A crystal sword light slashed at the vine.</p><p>The vine waved a few vines in front of it to block the sword light, but the vines were also swept away.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The absolute beauty continued to approach the Vine’s head.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The vine gate roared and struggled. Its head broke free from the wall.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The huge body of the vine was completely revealed.</p><p>It had a huge head and nine thick vines around its body, making it look like an octopus.</p><p>The vine had completely left the wall and its body was more agile. With a flash, it dodged the attack of the absolute beauty. At the same time, it waved the vine and attacked the absolute beauty.</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s body was covered in a transparent sword light. Two vines whipped the sword light, and the sword light trembled. The absolute Beauty’s body also trembled.</p><p>However, she still had a determined and stubborn look on her face as she continued to charge toward the Vine’s head.</p><p>“Man and sword as one, kill!”</p><p>In the end, the absolute beauty shouted. She turned into a sword light and rushed toward the Vine’s head, ignoring her own defense.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The vines waved a few of them and whipped at the beautiful woman. They whipped the sword light around her, causing it to shake violently.</p><p>The beautiful woman’s body trembled, and blood seeped out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>However, she didn’t care about that. She gritted her teeth and continued to rush toward the Vine’s head.</p><p>“This crazy woman doesn’t even care about her own safety!”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. At this moment, he felt a slight warmth in his heart.</p><p>After all, this woman was trying to save him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>&Nbsp; the sword light that the beautiful woman had transformed into was extremely powerful and emitted shocking power. It charged at the vine head as if it was going to split it in half.</p><p>The Vine’s eyes finally revealed a trace of panic.</p><p>It roared and the vines that were wrapped around Lu Ming loosened. It ignored Lu Ming and whipped the beautiful woman.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The nine vines continued to lash at the absolute beauty. The absolute Beauty’s protective sword light finally could not withstand it and was shattered.</p><p>At the same time, the gem on the Vine’s head that was emitting extreme coldness glowed. A ray of light rushed out and rushed toward the absolute beauty.</p><p>This ray of light was shockingly fast and hit the absolute beauty in an instant.</p><p>The beautiful woman’s body trembled and flew back.</p><p>However, as she flew back, a sword light flew out of her hand and cut the Vine’s head.</p><p>However, as the absolute beauty was sent flying, the sword light was also slightly off-course, and it cut one of the Vine’s eyes, leaving a deep wound.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The vines howled madly, and the nine vines danced wildly. Lu Ming dodged in a hurry, and one of the vines whipped the beautiful woman who was flying backward. The beautiful woman was sent flying and crashed into the wall on the side before falling to the ground.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that a layer of ice crystals quickly appeared on the beautiful woman’s body, trying to freeze her.</p><p>“Let’s go, quickly … Hurry up and leave this place …”</p><p>The beautiful woman did not die. She glared at Lu Ming and shouted. After she finished speaking, she spat out a few more mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“This crazy woman …”</p><p>Lu Ming was really confused.</p><p>Previously, this woman was bent on killing Lu Ming. Now, she was willing to risk being severely injured to save Lu Ming. After being injured, she even told Lu Ming to leave quickly.</p><p>This change was too fast.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not wish to leave now.</p><p>The vines were injured, and it was a good opportunity to kill them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he continued to attack the vines.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The vine roared and waved, lashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body shrank and returned to his human form. He then executed the nine heavenly kun Peng technique to its maximum and dodged continuously.</p><p>With his body shrunk, he became more agile and dodged more easily. Coupled with the eighth level of the nine heavenly kun Peng technique, Lu Ming dodged nine attacks from the vines in a row and rushed towards the head of the vine.</p><p>When Lu Ming was near the Vine’s head, the gem on its head glowed again. A white beam of light rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the beam of light that had attacked the beautiful woman earlier. It was shockingly fast, and it also had a terrifying chill.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to hide but he could not.</p><p>The absolute beauty didn’t Dodge it either.</p><p>The next moment, the White beam of light attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a bone-chilling cold burst out, wanting to freeze him completely. It was not just his physical body, but also his soul.</p><p>Cold!</p><p>It was extremely cold!</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts seemed to be frozen. This was an extremely terrifying thing.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had the ‘measure’ formula.</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the ” measure ” formula glowed. A devouring force enveloped Lu Ming’s entire body. Immediately, the bone-chilling cold was completely devoured by the ” measure ” formula. Lu Ming regained his freedom in an instant.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming increased his speed and in a flash, he was in the mouth of the vine.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming rush into the mouth of the vine, the absolute Beauty’s eyes revealed a trace of complicated feelings.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
