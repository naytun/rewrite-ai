Jie my ass!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. Since he had already offended them, he did not care who Jie was. He only had one word to say: kill!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear swept down. Jin Xing let out an unwilling scream. His body exploded and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and put away the storage rings of Jin Xing and the rest.</p><p>“He’s dead, Jin Xing is dead!”</p><p>“This Lu Ming is simply someone who is not afraid of anything!”</p><p>“This kind of person is the most terrifying. We’d better not provoke him!”</p><p>Seeing that Jin Xing and the rest were killed, many people kept quiet out of fear. They looked at Lu Ming with fear in their eyes.</p><p>To the geniuses of the major aristocratic families, people like Lu Ming were the most terrifying. He had no scruples at all. No matter who you were, if you provoked him, he would kill you!</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the crowd indifferently. Then, he turned into a ray of light and left the place.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had left myriad God cliff and landed on a mountain peak. He then took out his voice transmission jade talisman and sent a voice transmission to Qiu Yue.</p><p>However, the result was the same. The news could not be spread at all.</p><p>“AI!”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed softly, his face full of worry.</p><p>“I wonder if Wu Ming and Wu Yue have any news of Qiu Yue. Let’s send a message!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming sent another message to Wu Ming and the rest, asking about Qiu Yue’s situation.</p><p>The news had been sent out, but there was no response.</p><p>“Could it be that the distance is too far, and Wu Ming and the others didn’t receive the news?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming had no choice but to travel around while asking for information about Qiu Yue.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few months had passed.</p><p>On a flat piece of land, a figure was moving about. He held a long spear in his hand and kept waving it around. The long spear was like a Divine Dragon writhing.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Spear’s radiance burst forth, leaving deep pits on the flat ground.</p><p>Half a day later, the Spear’s momentum suddenly changed. The Spear’s light expanded and a dazzling Spear’s light shot up into the sky. It only dissipated after a long time.</p><p>“I’ve finally broken through the three apocalyptic strikes!”</p><p>The figure muttered.</p><p>This figure was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>A few months ago, Lu Ming had been traveling here and cultivating the three apocalyptic strikes.</p><p>When he was comprehending the divine power at myriad God cliff, Lu Ming had experienced intense battles in the starry sky. After that, he had continuously fought with Qin Wukong, Jin Yuan, and the others. Lu Ming’s comprehension of the three apocalyptic strikes had already reached a limit.</p><p>After a period of comprehension, he had finally broken through the three apocalyptic strikes and reached the eighth level.</p><p>The three apocalyptic strikes had broken through to the eighth level. Regardless of whether it was the first move, sky-piercing strike, the second move, moon-cutting strike, or the third move, exploding star, the power had all increased by a level.</p><p>Now, when Lu Ming faced Jin Yuan again, he did not have to fight so hard.</p><p>Lu Ming adjusted his breathing and took out the map to take a look.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to explore another forbidden area and see if he could gain anything.</p><p>After choosing the right direction, Lu Ming headed west.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming had covered a long distance.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>&Nbsp; suddenly, a massive boom came from the right, and divine power shot into the sky.</p><p>There were people fighting over there.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He was considering whether he should go and take a look when he saw a few figures flying rapidly from that direction.</p><p>“Wu Ming, Wu Yue …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up at the sight of these few figures.</p><p>These few figures were actually Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and Wu zixiong, who was also among them.</p><p>But now, they were in an extremely sorry state.</p><p>His aura was weak and his body was covered in wounds. Blood was flowing out and he was in a sorry state.</p><p>They flew forward in fear, as if they were escaping from some terrible danger.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over without any hesitation.</p><p>The next moment, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest also saw Lu Ming.</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ming, Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t come over. Leave quickly, leave quickly!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others shouted anxiously.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was unmoved. He continued to fly toward Wu Ming and the rest.</p><p>since you’ve met him, you’re too naive to think you can leave. You can all stay!</p><p>A cold voice came from behind Wu Ming and the rest. Then, Lu Ming saw a chariot speeding over.</p><p>The chariot was huge and was made of gold and Jade. It was not made of ordinary gold, but an extremely precious tool-refining material.</p><p>There was a curtain on the chariot, so he couldn’t see what was going on inside.</p><p>And pulling the chariot were two pitch-black savage wild beasts with wide mouths and fangs, roaring continuously.</p><p>On both sides of the chariot, there were a young man and a young woman. They held long sabers in their arms, and their faces were cold.</p><p>However, what made Lu Ming’s eyes narrow was that there was a chain at the back of the chariot that was pulling a string of people.</p><p>Yes, it really was a group of twelve people. Each one of them was a young man, but they were all heavily injured and their breathing was weak. They were chained up and their faces were filled with despair.</p><p>“The Prodigy of the universal camp!”</p><p>Lu Ming had some impression of a few of the twelve people who were chained up. They were the prodigies of the universal camp.</p><p>The chariot was extremely fast, chasing after Wu Yue and the others.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Wu zixiong gave a furious roar and suddenly stopped. He circulated his Shen power and pushed out a palm.</p><p>Immediately, warhorses formed and galloped towards the chariot.</p><p>“Putting up a stubborn resistance, overestimating your own strength!”</p><p>On the left side of the chariot, a young man holding a saber said coldly. He took a step forward and unsheathed his saber. A terrifying Saber Light flashed.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang …’</p><p>With a Flash of the Blade light, the war horses that Wu zixiong had condensed were all shattered. The blade light did not stop as it slashed towards Wu zixiong.</p><p>Wu zixiong gave a muffled groan and his body retreated madly. On his body, another wound appeared and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Zixiong, are you alright?”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue and the rest were shocked, they quickly stopped and supported Wu zixiong.</p><p>“If I didn’t need to keep some fresh ones, you would have been dead!”</p><p>The saber-hugging young man said coldly.</p><p>“Looks like we won’t be able to leave today!”</p><p>Wu zixiong sighed.</p><p>The saber-hugging young man was extremely powerful. Even at his peak, he was no match for him, let alone being injured.</p><p>Moreover, the other party still had three people who had not made a move.</p><p>The most shocking thing was that the person in the chariot was the real big Shot.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he appeared beside Wu zixiong and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, why aren’t you leaving? hey, why aren’t you leaving!”</p><p>Wu Ming sighed repeatedly.</p><p>he knows his own limits. He knows that he can’t escape, so he didn’t leave. Hehehe!</p><p>The saber-wielding youth sneered.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the saber-hugging teenager and asked Wu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Lu Ming, they’re from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!”</p><p>Wu Ming said.</p><p>the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>Before they entered, Bai Li had told them that there were other heaven’s favorites from the other Heavenly King manors entering star-moon ancient city. Including the nine absolute Heavenly King manors, there were a total of four heaven’s favorites from the Heavenly King manors.</p><p>He had not met them before, but now, he had finally met the other members of the Heavenly King Manor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
