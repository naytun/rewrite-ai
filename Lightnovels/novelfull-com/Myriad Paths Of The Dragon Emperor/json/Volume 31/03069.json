You, you, you all go in first …”</p><p>Bai Li began to make arrangements. This time, he arranged for the others to enter in batches.</p><p>The first group included Yi Xiang and a dozen young men of the winged men race.</p><p>Yi Xiang and the young man of the winged man race rushed into the wormhole and disappeared.</p><p>After a while, Bai Li arranged for a new group of people to enter.</p><p>Just like that, batch after batch.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest were left to the end.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. This Bai Li was obviously biased towards Yi Xiang. He had deliberately arranged for them to enter the wormhole in batches. Furthermore, he had arranged for Yi Xiang to be in the first batch and left Lu Ming behind. He was afraid that Lu Ming would attack Yi Xiang when they returned to the universal camp.</p><p>With this, Yi Xiang would have time to escape when he returned to the universal camp.</p><p>What a good plan.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not object. He could only wait quietly.</p><p>“Now, follow me!”</p><p>At the end, Bai Li said to Lu Ming and the rest. The group flew into the wormhole and returned to the territory of the universal camp.</p><p>After returning to the universal camp, Lu Ming scanned the surroundings. Indeed, he did not see Yi Xiang and the rest. They must have left long ago or even left the universal camp to return to the winged men’s family clan.</p><p>“Brothers, Lu Ming has a request!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest.</p><p>“Brother Lu, if you have something to say, just say it. If we can do it, we will definitely not refuse!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others nodded in agreement.</p><p>Putting aside the fact that they were considered friends with Lu Ming, Lu Ming’s talent alone was enough to shock them. They had never seen anyone with such terrifying talent as Lu Ming.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, his future achievements would definitely be boundless.</p><p>In the future, when he grew up, he might become an important figure in the great void Holy dynasty. They definitely had to build a good relationship with such a figure.</p><p>The best time to make friends with a person was when the other party had not yet grown up.</p><p>“I must kill Yi Xiang. After that, I’ll have to trouble the few of you to help me find out Yi Xiang’s whereabouts!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“So it’s this matter. It’s a small matter, leave it to us!”</p><p>that’s right. Our Wu family has many spies in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. It’s extremely easy to find out a person’s whereabouts!</p><p>Wu Ming and Wu Yue patted their chests and agreed readily.</p><p>“However, brother Lu, the lightning winged race is very powerful. More importantly, there are many branches of the race. They are very powerful. You have to be careful when you kill Yi Xiang!”</p><p>Wu zixiong reminded.</p><p>“I know, thank you for your concern, brother Wu!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>He naturally knew that the winged man Tribe was not to be trifled with. However, they had almost killed Qiu Yue. He could not just let it go.</p><p>Moreover, even if he wanted to let it go, the other party would not let him off so easily.</p><p>The few of them chatted as they flew to their respective residences.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and Qiu Yue returned to their residence.</p><p>In fact, with Qiu Yue’s current strength, she could easily challenge the others and take over a courtyard.</p><p>However, she liked to stay with Lu Ming. Naturally, there was no need for her to take over other courtyards.</p><p>“Qiuyue, your cultivation has just skyrocketed. You need to consolidate it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Qiu Yue.</p><p>yes, young master. I’ll go and cultivate then!</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and went back to her room to cultivate.</p><p>Lu Ming also walked toward his room. He had just opened the door when a round metal ball flew toward him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally back. I’m about to suffocate to death by staying here alone!”</p><p>QiuQiu cried out, its round body spinning.</p><p>“You, you eat and sleep, sleep and eat, will you feel lonely?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and sized QiuQiu up. His eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>QiuQiu, did you make another breakthrough in your cultivation? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, I’ve broken through. I’m at the second Sky of King God Realm now. Isn’t he amazing?”</p><p>QiuQiu bounced around with a smug look on its face.</p><p>“It is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>One must know that it was extremely difficult to break through to the divine King realm. Every breakthrough required a long period of accumulation.</p><p>However, QiuQiu had just broken through not long ago, and it had broken through again. This speed could be said to be astonishing.</p><p>“It seems that this guy only has precious metal attribute materials. When he breaks through, his speed is astonishing!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>In the hundreds of years that QiuQiu was in deep sleep, Lu Ming had accumulated a large amount of precious metal-attribute materials. After QiuQiu woke up, Lu Ming had given all of them to QiuQiu.</p><p>Clearly, QiuQiu’s cultivation had broken through to the second tier of the divine King realm after digesting the gold-attribute materials.</p><p>QiuQiu’s strength was already extremely shocking to begin with. Now that it had stepped into the second tier of the divine King realm, its strength was undoubtedly even more powerful.</p><p>“QiuQiu, I have something good for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and took out a few treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained two boxes in the castle in star-moon ancient city. Inside were some small towers, mirrors, and other treasures. Although many years had passed and a lot of their spirituality had been lost, the materials used to create these treasures were rare and precious. They would definitely be of great help to QiuQiu.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a few pieces and let QiuQiu try them to see the effects.</p><p>The moment QiuQiu saw these treasures, its eyes immediately flickered with an astonishing light, and it could no longer shift its gaze.</p><p>delicious, delicious, extremely delicious. Are these all for me? ”</p><p>QiuQiu looked at the few treasures and almost drooled.</p><p>“Will these treasures be of great help to you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Big, it’s definitely big, even bigger than the one you gave me before!”</p><p>QiuQiu immediately nodded, its eyes never leaving the few treasures, wishing it could hold them in its arms and take a few bites.</p><p>“Then take it, I still have more here, I’ll take it from you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and threw a few treasures to QiuQiu.</p><p>QiuQiu stretched out its two claws and directly grabbed it. Then, it stuffed it into its mouth and began to chew.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked into the room. He sat cross-legged on the bed and a few storage rings appeared in his hand.</p><p>On this trip to star-moon ancient city, Lu Ming had killed many enemies. They were all top geniuses. He must have gained a lot from obtaining their storage rings.</p><p>Lu Ming checked them one by one.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming had tidied up all the items in the storage ring.</p><p>Great harvest!</p><p>With so many heaven’s favorites “belongings added together, it was truly a great harvest.</p><p>All sorts of divine artifacts, divine pills, materials, and divine crystals were piled up like mountains.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had almost used up all his divine crystals to buy five divine-grade divine skills and wonderful techniques. Now, he had more divine crystals.</p><p>These were still considered good. What delighted Lu Ming the most were the divine techniques.</p><p>Lu Ming sorted out four divine-grade techniques in the storage rings of these peerless geniuses. As for the divine-grade techniques, there were dozens of them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not interested in the divine grade technique at all. He casually stuffed it into a storage ring.</p><p>What Lu Ming was concerned about were the four divine-grade mystical techniques.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
