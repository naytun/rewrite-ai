How terrifying was its power?</p><p>The two Second Sky of King God Realm experts didn’t even have time to scream. Their bodies were turned into ashes in the lightning, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>This scene was even more shocking than Lu Ming’s instant killing of the two first level divine kings.</p><p>It almost scared him to death.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and threw another punch with an imposing aura.</p><p>Several more bolts of lightning were shot out. This time, a third level Divine King expert was caught in the lightning.</p><p>This third level Godking realm expert was an ancient doyen of the unique devil Academy. He had lived for a long time and possessed extremely terrifying strength. However, at this moment, his face was filled with fear. He tried his best to block the attack but realized that he could not block the lightning attack.</p><p>.com</p><p>He let out an unwilling scream as his defenses were completely destroyed. The lightning struck his body heavily, ending his life.</p><p>The terrifying third level Divine King realm expert was turned into a charred corpse and sent flying.</p><p>At the scene, everyone else was already numb.</p><p>The powerhouses who fought with Lu Ming were almost scared to death.</p><p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p><p>They roared and retreated like crazy.</p><p>Lu Ming was simply a demon, an undefeatable demon.</p><p>No matter how strong it was, it would be devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s too late to retreat now. Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and charged forward.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re courting death!”</p><p>At this moment, an extremely angry voice was heard. Then, a sword light cut through the void and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword radiance was 30000 meters long and its power was earth-shattering. The world trembled as the sword radiance came out, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Faced with this sword, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He could not be bothered to chase after the others and used all his strength to resist this sword gleam.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch with all his might. In an instant, more than a dozen lightning bolts burst out from his fist. The lightning bolts intertwined together and blasted toward the sword light.</p><p>The lightning and the sword light collided heavily, as if two planets had collided. A monstrous force erupted, engulfing everything.</p><p>The surrounding people all retreated in fear of being dragged in.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Then, the dozen or so lightning bolts crumbled one after another, turning into energy and disappearing.</p><p>The sword light was also shaking, but it was still stronger. Although it was weakening, it did not collapse.</p><p>After the lightning was completely destroyed, the sword gleam did not stop. It continued to slash toward Lu Ming and hit his fist.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a loud explosion and Lu Ming felt a terrifying force surging from the sword light. Lu Ming’s body shook violently and he was forced to retreat a few thousand meters.</p><p>what a powerful force! Fourth level of Godking realm!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath and suppressed the surging blood in his body.</p><p>The sword light dissipated, and a figure appeared in the air.</p><p>This person was the sect leader of the indestructible sword sect. At this moment, he was staring at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze, as if he wanted to kill Lu Ming with a single sword.</p><p>There was a terrifying sword light on his body that pierced through the clouds. It was a hundred thousand feet tall.</p><p>“Fourth level Divine King realm. You’ve also broken through to the fourth level Divine King realm. Impossible, impossible!”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan shouted in disbelief.</p><p>First, the Scarlet Flame clan’s patriarch had broken through to the fourth level of the divine King realm. Now, the immortal sword clan’s patriarch had also broken through to the fourth level of the divine King realm. What was going on?</p><p>“What? Fourth level of God King realm!”</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect and the ice Soul Clan were all shocked.</p><p>&Nbsp; the sect head of the indestructible sword sect had also broken through to the fourth level of the Godking realm. With that, the other party now had three fourth level Godking realm experts.</p><p>How could they fight this?</p><p>The excitement from Lu Ming’s display of power just now had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>that’s right. It’s the fourth level of Divine King realm. Today, you won’t be able to stir up any waves!</p><p>The sect leader of the eternal sword sect stared at Lu Ming. As he blinked, streams of sword Qi burst out.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I admit that I’ve underestimated you. Not only are you more powerful than I imagined, but you also have the help of a powerful metallic lifeform. However, your fate today is already decided. It can’t be changed!”</p><p>The sect master of the indestructible sword sect continued in a cold tone.</p><p>He had already tested Lu Ming’s combat strength when he attacked just now.</p><p>Before his breakthrough, he would not have been Lu Ming’s match. However, now that he had broken through to the fourth tier of the divine King realm, he had full confidence that he could suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>“Oh, really? Although you’re strong, I’m afraid you’re not strong enough to kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Even though the sect master of the inextinguishable sword sect was strong, he was not as strong as the winged man family’s fourth level Godking.</p><p>Back at the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, Lu Ming had also worn the armor that QiuQiu had transformed into and fought with a fourth tier Divine King. That time, Lu Ming had been injured.</p><p>Even the armor that QiuQiu had transformed into was cracked open. This time, Lu Ming was only pushed back and his qi and blood were in turmoil.</p><p>Lu Ming was right. It would not be easy for the other party to kill him.</p><p>“Oh, really? Then what about me?”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. Then, the Dean of the unique demon Academy stepped out and stood side by side with the sect leader of the immortal sword sect. A terrifying aura also burst out from his body.</p><p>The strength of his aura was not any weaker than the sect master of the inextinguishable sword sect.</p><p>“And this Lord!”</p><p>As soon as the Dean of the Yimo Academy came out, the Holy Lord of the boundless Holy Land also stepped out. Together with the sect leader of the immortal sword sect and the Dean of the winged demon Academy, they surrounded Lu Ming in a triangular formation.</p><p>His aura was equally terrifying, not any weaker than the two people in front of him.</p><p>“Fourth level of the divine King realm. You’re all at the fourth level of the divine King realm. Impossible. How can you all have reached the fourth level of the divine King realm?”</p><p>The clan leader of the ice Soul Clan roared in disbelief.</p><p>He had a vague feeling that they had fallen into a conspiracy.</p><p>At the scene, the others were also shocked.</p><p>Especially the experts from the top sects, their faces were even uglier.</p><p>The cultivation bases of the three Overlord forces had all broken through to the fourth level of Godking realm. To the Qin heaven star region, this would bring about a tremendous change.</p><p>In the future, those top forces would have no way to fight against the three Overlord forces.</p><p>Even the powerhouses of the red flame tribe frowned.</p><p>In the past, only the Scarlet Flame clan and the ice Soul Clan had fourth level Divine King realm experts. Now, the three Overlord forces all had such existences. There would be many more variables in the future.</p><p>The Kong Xuan sect and the ice Soul clan’s faces turned pale with fear.</p><p>In this way, the difference in strength was too great. Were they really unable to escape death today?</p><p>Holy Son Lu Ming, if you have the chance to escape, you must escape. Your talent is rare. As long as you escape, the Kong Xuan sect will have hope of rising again!</p><p>Yue Wuya secretly sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Based on the abilities that Lu Ming had just displayed, if he disregarded the others and fought his way out, he might be able to escape.</p><p>“I, Lu Ming, am not the kind of person who would disregard others and escape alone.”</p><p>“Moreover, why do we need to run when we’re dealing with these people?” Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
