This kind of person had extremely strong survival abilities.</p><p>If they were in an open space outside, Lu Ming would not be able to kill young master sky Mantis even with his current strength.</p><p>However, young master sky Mantis was a little unlucky. There was an underground space filled with extremely hard statues. Lu Ming had sealed the surroundings with ice chains, which interfered with young master sky Mantis’s ability to move. Lu Ming then seized the opportunity to kill him.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had to use the supernova several times to kill young master sky Mantis.</p><p>It would be very difficult to break through young master sky Mantis’s defense with any other moves.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming sized up his surroundings.</p><p>There was actually an underground space here, and it was very deep in the ground. Earlier, young master sky Mantis had smashed into the ground continuously and was bombarded by Lu Ming. He had blasted through the ground for at least a few thousand miles before he entered this underground space.</p><p>In other words, this underground space had never been discovered by anyone.</p><p>An undiscovered underground space could also be considered an underground ruin. Could there be any treasures?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up slightly.</p><p>Since he was already here, he might as well explore it.</p><p>However, at this moment, veined patterns suddenly appeared on the ground.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He realized that the blood that spilled out from young master sky Mantis’s body had been absorbed by the ground. Then, blood-red lines appeared on the ground and covered the entire underground space.</p><p>Even the statues had blood-red patterns on them.</p><p>This was a huge formation!</p><p>Lu Ming instantly determined that this was a big array that seemed to have been activated by young master sky Mantis ‘blood.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He could not stay here for long. Just as he was about to soar into the sky and rush out through the gap, the ground let out a violent roar. One of the pieces of the ground suddenly jutted up and blocked the gap.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, the entire underground space changed. Some places protruded, and some places sank.</p><p>The surrounding environment had changed greatly.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Furthermore, the shaking became more and more intense, as if the entire land was shaking violently.</p><p>At this moment, a shocking scene was happening outside.</p><p>Thick runes suddenly appeared in the area where Lu Ming and young master sky Mantis had been fighting. Countless runes were densely packed, intertwining and revolving around each other. They emitted a dazzling radiance that covered the territory within tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Furthermore, the runes were still expanding rapidly. Soon, they covered an area of 100000 miles.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others ‘expressions changed. They kept retreating for fear of being enveloped by the runes. They kept standing outside the range of the runes.</p><p>a formation! Why is there a formation here that covers a radius of 100000 miles? ”</p><p>“Not good, brother Lu Ming is still inside!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others ‘expressions changed.</p><p>“Let’s go and save brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Wu zixiong gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The others nodded and then rushed towards the area covered by the formation.</p><p>However, just as they charged into the formation’s range, they were sent flying by an invisible energy.</p><p>They were actually unable to get close to the area covered by the formation.</p><p>“We’re in trouble!”</p><p>Wu Ming and the others stopped outside the formation, their expressions ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming was in the big array and he did not know how he was doing.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground was shaking more and more violently.</p><p>Countless runes interweaved and formed a mysterious formation. It emitted a dazzling light, and the light grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>Not long after, endless light rays intertwined together, forming an incomparably huge pillar of light that shot into the sky, piercing through the firmament.</p><p>Half of the sky was dyed blood red.</p><p>At this moment, everyone in all directions, even if they were far away, had noticed the abnormality here.</p><p>Some were flying, some were resting, and some were chatting. However, at this moment, their gazes were involuntarily attracted to this side.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>the sky is filled with multicolored light. It’s so shocking. Could it be that a rare treasure has appeared? ”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes flickered, and then they rushed toward the light.</p><p>Not long after, many people had gathered in the area where Lu Ming and young master sky Mantis were fighting.</p><p>They were all heaven’s favorites from all over the world.</p><p>However, these elites were all blocked. They stood outside the array and watched from a distance.</p><p>However, these heaven’s favorites were clearly divided into two camps.</p><p>One of them was the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, and the other was the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>As time passed, more and more people gathered here.</p><p>a rare treasure has appeared. It must be a rare treasure. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be such a commotion!</p><p>Many people’s eyes were burning.</p><p>a rare treasure has appeared. People of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, get lost!</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>hehe, what a joke. It’s your nine blades Heavenly King mansion that should get lost!</p><p>Immediately, a heaven’s favorite from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion sneered in response.</p><p>The 27 Heavenly King manors of the great void Holy dynasty were all competitors. Many of them had conflicts and even grudges over resources.</p><p>The relationship between the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and the nine saber Heavenly King mansion was not harmonious.</p><p>When they met, friction was inevitable.</p><p>“Then you will die!”</p><p>die! a heaven’s favorite from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion shouted coldly and unsheathed his saber. A terrifying Saber Light was slashed out.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A heaven’s favorite from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was killed right there and then.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill this bunch of bastards!”</p><p>Instantly, the paragons of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were furious. They attacked one after another, attacking the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The heaven’s favorite of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion was not to be outdone and launched a counterattack.</p><p>Most of the elites of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion cultivated blade techniques, and they slashed out blade lights.</p><p>At the scene, a chaotic battle broke out.</p><p>Of course, not all the heaven’s favorites were involved. Some of them didn’t make a move but retreated to keep a distance.</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others also retreated a distance.</p><p>The battle between the heaven’s favorites was extremely intense. In an instant, someone died and his blood splattered across the sky.</p><p>The battle was getting more and more intense, and both sides suffered losses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Suddenly, a dazzling Saber Light flashed in the crowd.</p><p>This Saber Light was extremely dazzling and pierced through the nine Heavens. It was filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>A few paragons from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion were killed in succession and split into two.</p><p>“Origin divine power factor, it’s origin divine power factor!”</p><p>“A prodigy who has awakened the origin divine power factor has made his move!”</p><p>Someone from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor’s side shouted loudly, extremely shocked.</p><p>Against such a person, ordinary heaven’s favorites were not his match.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
