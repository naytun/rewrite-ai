So, I had to kill you!</p><p>The beautiful woman’s voice turned cold.</p><p>Lu Ming understood a lot after listening to the absolute Beauty’s words.</p><p>Her father was Jing Yu’s teacher, and he was well-versed in the art of divination. He knew that Jing Yu’s successor was about to be born, and thus, he wanted his daughter to marry him.</p><p>It was only when Lu Ming was fighting with Leng Ying at the universal camp that the beautiful lady’s father saw him and recognized him.</p><p>It was no wonder that the absolute beauty wanted to kill Lu Ming as soon as she saw him.</p><p>“Since you want to kill me, why did you save me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>father wants me to marry you and protect you. So, you have to die. You can only die in my hands, not in the hands of anyone else!</p><p>The absolute beauty said. As she said this, her voice became weaker and weaker.</p><p>“This logic is really weird!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and was rather speechless.</p><p>However, according to this logic, it made sense.</p><p>If that was the case, he had to save this absolute beauty even more.</p><p>It wasn’t because of her beauty, but because she was the daughter of teacher Jing Yu.</p><p>From the looks of it, those who had followed Jing Yu back then hadn’t been completely suppressed. There were still people alive. In the future, if he were to help Jing Yu reverse his verdict, he would still need the help of these people.</p><p>Lu Ming squatted down and held the beautiful woman’s hand.</p><p>“You … What are you doing? You said that you would let me go if I answered your question. You can’t go back on your word …”</p><p>The absolute beauty panicked.</p><p>She thought that Lu Ming was going to do something to her.</p><p>“What are you panicking for? I’m saving you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and channeled a stream of divine power into the beautiful woman’s body.</p><p>However, the moment the divine power entered the other’s body, it was frozen by the terrifying cold air in the other’s body.</p><p>her body has been completely frozen by the cold air, and it’s almost frozen to her heart and brain. If these two places are frozen, she’s going to die!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Can you suck out the cold Qi in her body?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course I can, but I can’t expose myself. Put your palm on her palm and I’ll draw the cold out of her body. But this way, it will be slower!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>If the ” measure ” formula appeared directly and the devouring power enveloped the beautiful woman, it would be easy to absorb the cold Qi in her body. However, if that were the case, the ” measure ” formula would be exposed.</p><p>The origin ancient word could not be exposed now, or else it would bring a great disaster.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s slow!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Then, his palm and the beautiful woman’s palm touched.</p><p>The beautiful woman’s palm had been frozen into ice. It was as cold as a piece of ten-thousand-year-old ice.</p><p>When they stuck to each other, the ” measure ” formula burst out with an attractive force. It flowed along Lu Ming’s palm and rushed into the beautiful woman’s body. The cold air in the beautiful woman’s body was continuously absorbed by Lu Ming’s palm and then entered the ” measure ” formula.</p><p>The absolute beauty blinked her eyes twice. She was rather curious. She did not expect Lu Ming to have such means. Initially, she thought that she was dead for sure.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, the sound of something breaking through the air could be heard. It came from the direction of the passageway that Lu Ming and the rest had entered from.</p><p>“There’s someone …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>He didn’t expect that someone would be able to find their way in here.</p><p>The next moment, five figures appeared in the underground space.</p><p>“It’s them …”</p><p>Lu Ming saw five figures at a glance. They were the white-haired young man and the other four he had met earlier.</p><p>The white-haired young man and the other four swept their gazes across the room and their eyes landed on Lu Ming and the beautiful lady. They were shocked to see the beautiful lady, but their eyes lit up when they swept their gazes across the scene.</p><p>They were not stupid. After seeing the corpse of the vine and the situation of Lu Ming and the beautiful woman, how could they not guess?</p><p>“Hahaha, this is the myriad rivers ice vine. I didn’t expect that this place would actually give birth to a myriad rivers ice vine. What great luck!”</p><p>A young man laughed excitedly when he saw the corpse of the vine. His eyes were filled with a fiery light.</p><p>the greatest luck is that the myriad river ice vine has been killed. We don’t have to do anything now, hahaha!</p><p>Another young man laughed.</p><p>“It’s you? Get lost!”</p><p>The absolute beauty shouted coldly when she saw the white-haired young man and the others.</p><p>“Aiyoyo, you’re still so arrogant. Did we interrupt your date with your little lover? Hehe, you’re still so arrogant in your current state. You really don’t know what’s good for you!”</p><p>The white-haired young man cried out as he stared at the beautiful woman with an unfriendly look.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The absolute beauty was furious, and her almond-shaped eyes widened. If it wasn’t for the fact that her entire body was frozen by the cold air, she would have immediately attacked and taught the white-haired youth and the others a profound lesson.</p><p>“You what? With your current condition, do you still want to deal with us? You can’t even protect yourself, right?”</p><p>The white-haired young man sized up the beautiful woman and revealed an unscrupulous smile. a beauty like you is rare. Don’t worry, I’ll let you have a good time before I kill you. Haha!</p><p>The white-haired young man laughed.</p><p>The absolute Beauty’s face turned pale in an instant. She naturally knew what the white-haired young man was going to do.</p><p>“Quick, Lu Ming, kill me. I’m begging you, kill me …”</p><p>The absolute beauty sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming. She would rather die than be humiliated by the white-haired young man.</p><p>“How unlucky …”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the white-haired young man and the others would come again after he dealt with the vines.</p><p>Lu Ming could escape from the white-haired young man and the rest. The key was that he had yet to obtain the gem on the Vine’s head.</p><p>It would be a pity to leave like this. Moreover, he might not be able to escape safely if he were to leave with the absolute beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around and he began to think of countermeasures.</p><p>“Third brother, let’s hurry up and get rid of this brat, lest a long night brings trouble!”</p><p>One of the young men said.</p><p>alright, leave this kid to me. You guys collect the corpse of the myriad rivers ice vine and leave this place after quickly dealing with it!</p><p>With that, the white-haired young man walked toward Lu Ming, while the other young men walked toward the vines.</p><p>One of the young men walked up to the vine and tried to use a storage ring to store the Vine’s body.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The vines that were originally motionless suddenly moved again.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>A few vines started to dance like snakes and charged towards the young men.</p><p>This situation was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The vine clearly had no life left, so why did it suddenly move again?</p><p>Not only the white-haired young man, but even Lu Ming and the beautiful woman were stunned.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Caught off guard, one of the young men was directly pierced by a vine.</p><p>Then, with a swing of the vine, he picked up the young man and smashed him heavily onto the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground trembled, and the young man was killed on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
