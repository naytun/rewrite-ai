Watching them fight carefully and feeling the aura of the origin divine power factor could indeed give them some inspiration.</p><p>Xu Yan and Si Ji, Jin Yuan and Chu baxing were still engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Right at this moment, two extremely resplendent golden lights once again collided. Then, the golden light exploded, and the two figures were forced back.</p><p>It was Chu BA Xing and Jin Yuan.</p><p>However, Chu BA Xing retreated even shorter, while Jin Yuan retreated even further.</p><p>“The void severing Dao is only so-so!”</p><p>Chu baxing said indifferently. His body was also covered in golden light, and his spear buzzed as his battle intent soared.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>In the confrontation just now, he had actually been at a disadvantage and was faintly suppressed by Chu BA Xing.</p><p>“Damn it, how is this possible? My Jin family’s void shattering Dao is invincible. How can it be suppressed?”</p><p>Jin Yuan roared in his heart.</p><p>First, he had lost to Lu Ming and had to flee in a sorry state. He did not even care about Jin Xing’s life. Now, he was being suppressed by Chu baxing. This made Jin Yuan’s expression turn ugly. He even began to doubt the Jin clan’s void severing Dao.</p><p>“No, my Jin family’s void shattering Dao is the strongest!”</p><p>Jin Yuan roared in his heart, and his aura became more and more violent.</p><p>There were nine golden combat swords around him. At this moment, the nine golden combat swords merged into one and merged into Jin Yuan’s body.</p><p>His body began to transform, turning into a golden sword.</p><p>Jin Yuan was going all out. He was going to use his strongest move.</p><p>The attack power of this move was shocking. Back then, he had used this move to cut off Lu Ming’s ice chains.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Jin Yuan shouted. His body turned into a golden sword light and slashed towards Chu baxing.</p><p>Facing this move, Chu baxing’s expression turned serious. He didn’t dare to be careless, and his body also emitted a dazzling golden radiance.</p><p>“God of War’s strike!”</p><p>Chu baxing shouted and thrust his spear forward.</p><p>A dazzling light burst out from the spear, and then a huge figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p>It was a Golden God of War. It was extremely huge and 10000 feet tall. It held a huge spear and stabbed at Jin Yuan at an astonishing speed. It collided with the sword light that Jin Yuan had transformed into.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrible whistling sound was heard in the void, and the force surged out like a giant wave. The giant God of War in golden armor shook violently, and then cracks appeared on it.</p><p>In the end, starting from the long spear, it exploded inch by inch. In an instant, the entire golden-armored real God had collapsed.</p><p>Chu baxing was hit by the force, and his body trembled as he was forced to retreat dozens of steps.</p><p>However, Jin Yuan didn’t have a good time either. The combat sword he had transformed into was sent flying tens of thousands of meters away. He turned back into his human form. His face was pale, and a trace of blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Interesting, this move is more like it!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing licked his lips and sneered.</p><p>Hmph! Jin Yuan snorted, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</p><p>In the confrontation just now, he was faintly at a disadvantage again.</p><p>Even his most powerful move was unable to do anything to Chu BA Xing. This was a huge blow to him.</p><p>“That Chu baxing is so strong!”</p><p>Many people looked at Chu BA Xing with a grave expression, including the heaven’s favorites of the same level as the youth in animal hide.</p><p>I heard that Chu baxing’s clan is the clan of the God of War. When the great void Holy dynasty was first established, his ancestor was a true God of War with unparalleled combat power!</p><p>I’ve also heard of it. However, the younger generation was not up to standard and lacked talents. It slowly declined, and now, it can only live in the nine blades Heavenly King mansion!</p><p>“A starving camel is still bigger than a horse!”</p><p>Many people were discussing in low voices as they looked at Chu BA Xing with increasingly grave gazes.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>&Nbsp; at this moment, the ground suddenly began to shake even more violently, as if the world was about to collapse.</p><p>“Look, what’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed at the center of the array and shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked over, and many people’s eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>That was because, in that area, the ground split open and a huge object rushed out.</p><p>It was an incomparably huge castle that was emitting a pitch-black Radiance. At first, only the tip of the castle was exposed, but gradually, more and more parts of the castle were exposed, and it was also getting bigger.</p><p>Many people were at a loss for words. They didn’t expect that there would be a Castle underground.</p><p>Earlier, the symbols had filled the air and multicolored light had shot into the sky. This was a sign that this castle was about to be born.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ground shook more and more violently, and the rocks on the ground kept exploding and shattering. A moment later, a huge castle appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>This was a Castle that was a hundred thousand miles in length and width. It was pitch-black, and it was impossible to tell what material it was made of. From afar, it looked like an ancient divine mountain.</p><p>There was a circle of peach trees around the castle, surrounding it.</p><p>Each peach tree was so thick that it would take several people to wrap their arms around it. They were full of peach flowers, and the scene was full of vitality.</p><p>When the castle appeared, the runes on the ground also disappeared.</p><p>Many people’s eyes shone with a fiery light.</p><p>A Castle had appeared from underground. It was obvious that no one had explored it before. Could there be treasures inside?</p><p>The battle between Xu Yan and Si Ji also stopped.</p><p>Everyone’s attention was drawn to the castle.</p><p>“A Castle. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Then, some people started to approach the castle and fly towards it. However, when they got close to the castle, they were blocked by an invisible energy and could not enter at all.</p><p>“We still can’t go in?”</p><p>Some people were greatly disappointed.</p><p>The runes had disappeared, but he still couldn’t enter. He could only watch.</p><p>“No, we can enter this peach forest on foot!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>This was because someone had tried to land on the ground and rush toward the peach forest on foot. His figure disappeared into the peach forest.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Then, another person rushed into the peach forest. With a few flashes, this person’s figure disappeared into the peach forest without a trace.</p><p>“It doesn’t seem to be dangerous!”</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go too!”</p><p>Immediately, more people rushed into the peach forest.</p><p>Even Jin Yuan, Xu Yan, and the others were moved. They rushed into the peach forest and soon disappeared. The area became quiet.</p><p>However, about half an hour later, a few young men appeared at the edge of the peach forest with confused faces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
