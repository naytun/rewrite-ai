Why did you come out?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>I don’t know. I got lost as soon as I entered the peach forest. There was an endless peach forest in all directions. No matter how I turned, I couldn’t get out. I turned and turned and turned, and then I came back!</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>“Your situation is the same as mine!”</p><p>The crowd discussed and realized that they were in the same situation.</p><p>Everyone was the same. They were lost the moment they entered the peach forest, and they didn’t meet anyone else. No matter how they walked, they couldn’t pass through the peach forest. In the end, they returned to their original spot.</p><p>A great formation!</p><p>In the end, they came to the conclusion that this peach forest was a large array that could confuse people’s hearts. Once they entered, they would be confused and eventually return to their original place.</p><p>“Try from another direction!”</p><p>Some of them tried to go around the area and try to find out from another direction.</p><p>However, the castle was surrounded by peach trees. If one entered the peach trees from another direction, the situation would be the same as before. They would turn around and around before returning to their original place.</p><p>Every direction had been tried, but the result was the same.</p><p>“If we can’t walk in, then we’ll destroy this formation!”</p><p>Someone was very overbearing and attacked directly. One attack after another blasted towards the peach forest, wanting to destroy it.</p><p>As long as the peach forest was destroyed, the formation would also be destroyed.</p><p>However, their attacks did not cause any waves when they entered the peach forest.</p><p>Those attacks flew into the peach forest and disappeared immediately. They did not even manage to cut down a single peach.</p><p>Even Jin Yuan, Chu baxing, and the others had tried, but the results were the same.</p><p>Everyone was helpless.</p><p>They were clearly standing high up in the sky, and their line of sight could penetrate the peach forest and see the situation inside.</p><p>He could even see that behind the peach forest, there were small paths that led to the castle. He could even see the gate of the castle.</p><p>However, he could see it, but he could not enter.</p><p>If they flew up into the sky, they would be blocked by an invisible force. If they went down, they would be blocked by the peach forest formation.</p><p>See, can only see, can’t enter?</p><p>“Then … What’s that?”</p><p>Suddenly, a young man who was observing from high up in the sky shouted in shock.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!” Immediately, many people took to the air and flew to the sky to look into the castle. With one look, they were also dumbfounded.</p><p>That was because they saw a person walking out of one of the castle’s gates.</p><p>After a young man walked out of the door, he looked left and right, as if he was looking around.</p><p>“Why would someone come out of the castle? Could it be that this person has been living in the castle since the beginning of the heavenly Palace era?”</p><p>Someone said in a dry voice.</p><p>Many people’s faces changed.</p><p>How many years had it been since the beginning of the heavenly Palace era? it was simply impossible to calculate. Even if one were to calculate it in stellar years, it would still be difficult to calculate clearly.</p><p>It was an extremely long period of time.</p><p>A Divine King could only live for five star years at most. If someone could live from the beginning of the heavenly Palace era until now, what kind of cultivation would that be?</p><p>“No, why does this person look so familiar?”</p><p>“Lu Ming, he’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone from the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor shouted.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s Lu Ming. It’s really him!”</p><p>Even more of the nine extremes Heavenly King’s people started shouting.</p><p>“What? He’s a heaven’s favorite of your nine absolute Heavenly King mansion?”</p><p>This time, the people of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion were also shocked, but then they heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>It turned out that he was only a heaven’s favorite from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion and not an old monster who had survived from the beginning of the heavenly Palace era. That was good.</p><p>However, how did he get in?</p><p>Many people had more questions in their minds.</p><p>The person that everyone saw was indeed Lu Ming.</p><p>After he killed young master sky Mantis, the ground shook violently. The sky and the earth shook. His position seemed to be rising, and it took a long time before it stabilized.</p><p>After the situation had stabilized, Lu Ming spent some effort before he found the exit and walked out of the main door.</p><p>“It’s actually a Castle?”</p><p>Lu Ming sized it up and was secretly shocked.</p><p>He didn’t expect a Castle to emerge from the ground.</p><p>“Eh? So many people!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked outside and saw the dense crowd of people. They were all staring at him.</p><p>“Could it be that these people were attracted by this Castle? it’s possible!”</p><p>“I wonder how Wu Ming and Wu Yue are doing, let’s go out and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind raced. He then rose into the air and flew outside.</p><p>Without any obstruction, he directly passed through the range of the peach forest and flew out without any force to stop him.</p><p>“He’s out!”</p><p>Many people’s gazes shifted and they stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around, looking for Wu Ming and the rest. Suddenly, a powerful aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, a young man in golden armor stepped forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming. His divine power surged and swept toward Lu Ming like a gust of wind.</p><p>The Golden armored youth was Chu baxing.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He circulated his divine power and blocked the pressure.</p><p>“Kid, how did you get in? What did you get inside? Tell me everything in detail!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing spoke, his tone filled with command.</p><p>“Who are you? Move aside!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at Chu baxing and waved his hand casually. Then, his gaze swept in other directions, completely ignoring Chu baxing.</p><p>“This kid is finished!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts twitched. Lu Ming actually dared to speak to Chu baxing in this manner. Was he not courting death?</p><p>After all, only a few people had witnessed the battle between Lu Ming and Jin Yuan. Many people did not know about it.</p><p>In particular, the people from the nine blades Heavenly King mansion looked at Lu Ming with pity as if he was a dead man.</p><p>Chu baxing’s character was notorious for being overbearing. Lu Ming’s actions were undoubtedly seeking his own death.</p><p>“Who am I? Hehehe!”</p><p>As expected, Chu BA Xing sneered. His laughter was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>you’ll find out who I am soon. I’ll be your nightmare for the rest of your life!</p><p>Chu baxing spoke again. He then took a step forward and his claw grabbed at the air, aiming at Lu Ming.</p><p>A huge claw formed. Its five fingers were like five long Spears and it grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This move was extremely vicious. If it was an ordinary person who was caught, their cultivation would definitely be crippled.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not an ordinary person.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming made his move. With a punch, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon appeared and struck Chu baxing’s claws. With a loud boom, Chu baxing’s claws exploded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
