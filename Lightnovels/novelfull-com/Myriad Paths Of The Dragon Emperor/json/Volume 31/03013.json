It can also neutralize the energy of many star cores. Just wait!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and immediately started to cultivate.</p><p>This underground space was very remote. It was already in the coldnether forbidden ground, so almost no one came here.</p><p>Ever since LAN Ling left, no one else came to the place. Lu Ming was happy to be idle and he was focused on cultivating.</p><p>When the ” quantity ” formula had not transferred energy to him, Lu Ming had been focused on comprehending the secret skill. When there was energy, Lu Ming would refine it.</p><p>Every few months, the ” quantity ” formula would give him a stream of energy.</p><p>Just like that, another two years passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been here for more than three years.</p><p>In the past three years, Lu Ming’s cultivation level had improved rapidly.</p><p>In the beginning, the divine fire condensed from the five types of divine-grade divine energy had all been raised to the same level as the ruler’s divine energy and inextinguishable sword force. Then, the nine types of divine energy broke through together. Just a few days ago, Lu Ming had successfully broken through to fifth-tier celestial God.</p><p>The nine types of divine energy in his body had all broken through to the fifth-level celestial deity realm. This caused Lu Ming’s combat strength to skyrocket.</p><p>with my current combat strength, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to deal with the white-haired young man!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, secretly estimating his ability.</p><p>The white-haired young man was a half-step Divine King and his divine power was about sixty to seventy percent awakened.</p><p>Three years ago, Lu Ming was definitely not this person’s match.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was confident that he could defeat this person now.</p><p>Lu Ming estimated that his current ability should be equivalent to a half-step Divine King. The degree of awakening of his divine power was about 80 to 90% of the geniuses.</p><p>The comparison of strength here referred to the geniuses who controlled divine-grade divine power.</p><p>Without divine-grade divine power, there was no such thing as awakening divine power.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was probably no match for the powerful Indigo spirit.</p><p>my attack-type divine skill is still at the seventh level. If I can break through to the eighth level, I’ll be even stronger!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>However, such strength was already considered to be at the top among the heaven’s pride experts who had entered star-moon ancient city.</p><p>After all, there were only a few top talents who had awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>unfortunately, the energy of the chilling gem has been used up. Otherwise, I could continue to try!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and shook his head. He knew that he was being greedy.</p><p>This time, not only had his other five types of divine-grade divine power increased, but his cultivation had also broken through one level. This was already a great harvest.</p><p>One had to know that he had broken through with nine types of divine power at the same time. The amount of energy required was too terrifying. If he only cultivated one type of energy, he would definitely rise by more than one level.</p><p>I’ve already wasted more than three years. It’s time for me to go out and take a walk. It’s not easy for me to come to star-moon ancient city. I can’t waste my time like this!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the place.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming reached the surface and flew out of the land of the cold nether.</p><p>Very few people came to the coldnether forbidden ground. Lu Ming flew all the way and did not meet a single person. Not long after, Lu Ming left the range of the coldnether forbidden ground.</p><p>After leaving the coldnether forbidden grounds, Lu Ming took out a map and looked at it.</p><p>This map, was naturally the map given to him by Wu zixiong.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming locked onto the location.</p><p>Myriad God cliff!</p><p>On the map, there was a big circle, and the place was marked in big black characters.</p><p>This was an important place in star-moon ancient city. Previously, Wu zixiong and the rest had mentioned that Lu Ming could cultivate at myriad God cliff when he was free.</p><p>This was because this place could help people awaken the origin divine power factor.</p><p>It was said that many people had awakened the origin divine power factor at myriad God cliff in the past.</p><p>Or perhaps, some people had returned to the universal camp after cultivating at myriad God cliff and awakened their origin genes.</p><p>This was a place that they had to go to once they entered star-moon ancient city.</p><p>A few years ago, if Lu Ming had not been looking for Supreme cold treasures to improve his strength, he would have gone there long ago.</p><p>However, it was not too late to go now.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the directions on the map and headed towards myriad God cliff.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ming arrived at myriad God cliff.</p><p>Myriad God cliff was a cliff.</p><p>However, this cliff was very magnificent. It was hundreds of thousands of feet high and there were many statues carved on the cliff.</p><p>The statues were of different sizes, and they were carved with different gods.</p><p>Some were ferocious, some were majestic, and some were terrifying …</p><p>At a glance, there really were no less than 10000.</p><p>It was said that these statues were all carvings of primitive gods.</p><p>And in the air outside myriad God cliff, there were stone platforms floating in the air.</p><p>These stone platforms were extremely huge. Each one was ten miles in length and width. From high to low, from far to near, they were like steps floating in the air.</p><p>On each of these stone platforms, there was a figure sitting cross-legged.</p><p>On each stone platform, there was only one figure.</p><p>There were also many figures standing in the void outside the stone platform, watching from afar.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over. Many people glanced at him and ignored him.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had passed through the sky Gate and many people knew him, his cultivation level was very low. These people did not take it to heart.</p><p>Lu Ming did not mind and looked forward.</p><p>There was a person sitting cross-legged on each of the stone platforms, and a layer of light enveloped each person.</p><p>“Brother, why is there only one person on each stone platform? can’t the others go up?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked a young man who looked simple and honest.</p><p>“You just got here, right?”</p><p>The honest-looking young man glanced at him.</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>it’s said that this stone platform was used by ancient deities during the early stages of the heavenly Palace to observe the myriad God Cliff’s cultivation. Ancient deities were all extremely huge, which is why this stone platform is so big!</p><p>“And each stone platform can only accommodate one person at a time. If there are too many people, they will be bounced off!”</p><p>The honest-looking young man explained.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to a realization. No wonder there was only one person on each stone platform.</p><p>“Now that the stone platform has been occupied by them, won’t we have no chance?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“Of course there’s a chance, but everything must be fought for with strength!”</p><p>The honest-looking young man said.</p><p>“Fight for it with your own strength? What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>this stone platform was set up with a powerful restriction in the early days of the heavenly Palace era. It operates according to a certain rule. If a person practices on a stone platform, the formation of the stone platform will protect him.</p><p>The honest-looking young man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. There was a layer of light on the people on the stone platform. It was the power of the formation’s protection.</p><p>with the protection of the formation, you can cultivate in peace. Others can’t attack you. However, this protection has a time limit. After three months, this protection will disappear!</p><p>of course, it will only disappear for a short period of time. It will only last for one day. After one day, the protective power of the formation will appear again!</p><p>therefore, today is the day to fight for the stone platform!</p><p>The honest-looking young man said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
