He glared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Has he finally appeared?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.</p><p>At the sight of Jin Yuan, Lu Ming knew that he had guessed correctly. The other party had indeed arranged this on purpose to lure him into the trap.</p><p>“It seems that you’ve been waiting for me here for a long time!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you killed my Jin family’s people for no reason, and you even want to kill brother Yi Xiang. You’re simply too audacious. Now, why aren’t you surrendering? could it be that you’re waiting for us to make a move?”</p><p>Jin Yuan sneered.</p><p>The few people just now were from the Jin family. However, they were not very talented. The Jin family had pushed them out to let Lu Ming kill them.</p><p>Lu Ming was the one who killed first. If they killed Lu Ming after that, no one would say anything, even if Lu Ming was from the universal camp.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ming had fallen into their trap. Everything was going according to their plan.</p><p>gold ingot, you’re so loud. Come on, come and take me. Let’s see if you can take me down since you’ve lost.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Jin Yuan indifferently, his face full of mockery.</p><p>As soon as he said this, it attracted a wave of surprise from the other people in the restaurant.</p><p>“What does Lu Ming mean? Could he have defeated Jin Yuan?”</p><p>it can’t be. Jin Yuan is known as one of the four heroes of the Jin family. He has long awakened the divine force factor. Can Lu Ming defeat Jin Yuan? ”</p><p>it’s possible. Otherwise, why would Lu Ming dare to say that? ”</p><p>The people in the restaurant were in a heated discussion. They kept glancing at Jin Yuan and Lu Ming.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s face was extremely gloomy, and his killing intent was extremely strong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, now is not the time to fight with you one-on-one. You have killed a member of the Jin family. It’s time for you to pay with your life. Men, take him down!”</p><p>Gold ingot waved his hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A burly man stepped out from beside Jin Yuan, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>&Nbsp; this was a first-level Divine King, his aura as dense as a mountain, and his skin glowed with a golden luster like a golden man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Godking of the Jin clan threw a palm at Lu Ming. The void trembled violently and the violent force pressed down on Lu Ming like a tidal wave.</p><p>As soon as he made his move, Lu Ming could sense that although this Divine King of the Jin family had a similar cultivation base as the night Demon King, his combat strength was definitely above the night Demon King’s.</p><p>In an instant, all the divine power in Lu Ming’s body exploded and he activated the battle character formula that quadrupled his combat power.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. Then, a crescent-shaped spear radiance slashed out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The crescent-shaped spearlight collided with the palm of the Godking, creating a deep boom. The collision of the two caused a wave of energy to sweep out in all directions.</p><p>The entire restaurant trembled. However, in the next moment, the walls and floor of the restaurant glowed with light. Dense runes appeared and blocked the overflowing waves of energy.</p><p>As the largest Inn in the soaring cloud District, the inn was backed by a powerful force. The entire Inn was a treasure, and it was filled with formations. There was no need to fear a battle within it.</p><p>However, the expensive tables and chairs beside them were not protected by the formation. They were turned into dust by the waves of power from the two.</p><p>The other people in the restaurant also retreated.</p><p>However, there were also experts among them. There were quite a number of God kings. They all circulated their divine power and blocked the aftershock of Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear in Lu Ming’s hands trembled continuously. A powerful force surged forth, causing Lu Ming’s figure to drift backward.</p><p>The other party’s figure only swayed slightly before stabilizing.</p><p>Without transforming into his ancient God Body, Lu Ming was at a slight disadvantage in a head-on battle.</p><p>But this also shocked the others.</p><p>Now, many people could clearly see Lu Ming’s cultivation level. Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the sixth level celestial deity realm. It was truly unbelievable that a sixth level celestial deity could actually fight a first level Divine King existence head-on.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After the Godking of the Jin clan forced Lu Ming back, he immediately launched a fierce attack. His Golden Palm tore through the air and headed toward Lu Ming. His attack was like a storm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming didn’t want to fight him head-on. Instead, he used the nine heavenly kun Peng technique. A nine heavenly kun Peng appeared on his body and face. In a flash, Lu Ming’s figure charged towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>This time, he had to kill Yi Xiang!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was astonishing. He charged towards Yi Xiang like a bolt of lightning. Before he even reached Yi Xiang, a Spear’s gleam was already charging towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Yi Xiang was shocked.</p><p>die! the winged man race Godking beside Yi Xiang was prepared. He flapped his Lightning Wings and slashed at Lu Ming’s spear radiance, shattering it.</p><p>However, nine ice chains immediately flew towards Yi Xiang like dancing snakes.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the Godking of the winged men roared and exploded with a powerful aura. His body was covered in lightning.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lightning bolts as thick as an arm shot out from his body and struck the ice chains.</p><p>The nine ice chains exploded one after another with a series of explosions. In an instant, all nine ice chains exploded and turned into cold air.</p><p>The Godking of the winged man race was a second level Godking.</p><p>A second level Divine King was truly powerful, much more powerful than a first level Divine King.</p><p>The so-called “one rank higher can crush the other” was also suitable to describe the divine King realm.</p><p>In the divine King realm, those with a higher cultivation base would have an absolute advantage over those of a lower cultivation base. Even the geniuses who controlled divine-grade divine power would find it difficult to fight against those of a higher cultivation base.</p><p>Only some extremely monstrous geniuses could do it.</p><p>&Nbsp; as a result, the toughness of the ice chains had been shattered by the other party in one move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, the other party shouted coldly and pressed his palm down. The sky full of lightning pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>However, just as the other party made a move, Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he had already rushed to the other side.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t to kill Yi Xiang, but … Gold ingot!</p><p>Yes, this time, Lu Ming was charging toward Jin Yuan.</p><p>In reality, the reason why he had attacked Yi Xiang was just an illusion. His real target was Jin Yuan.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Lu Ming’s body expanded rapidly.</p><p>Lu Ming was transforming into his ancient God Body.</p><p>The amazing thing was that the height of the third floor of the restaurant was originally only a dozen meters.</p><p>However, as Lu Ming’s body grew rapidly, the height of the restaurant also increased rapidly. In the end, it became a few hundred meters tall and its length and width had also increased by several times.</p><p>In the tower amongst the clouds, there would often be people who would break out into conflicts or even fight. There were people from all kinds of races, and they were of different sizes.</p><p>Therefore, the entire tower in the clouds was a treasure. Not only was it filled with formations, but it could also change its size freely.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After transforming into the ancient God Body, Lu Ming’s combat strength soared. He swept his long spear at Jin Yuan.</p><p>Before the spear even reached him, the terrifying waves of force had already pressed down on Jin Yuan, causing his expression to change.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
