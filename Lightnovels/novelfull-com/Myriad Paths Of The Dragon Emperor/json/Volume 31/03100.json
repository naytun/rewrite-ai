Not only had they exterminated the dark ice Clan, but they had also almost exterminated the Scarlet Flame clan, their old enemy.</p><p>After he left this place, he could lead the Army and invade the red flame clan’s territory. From then on, the ice Soul Clan would become stronger and stronger. It was not impossible for them to regain their former glory.</p><p>The other members of the ice Soul Clan were also smiling.</p><p>Not only the ice Soul Clan, but the entire Kong Xuan sect was the same.</p><p>.com</p><p>After this battle, the winged demon Academy and the imperishable sword sect had been destroyed. Of the three overlords, only the boundless Holy Land was left.</p><p>The boundless Holy Land was stronger than before, but with Lu Ming in the Kong Xuan sect, they could only surrender.</p><p>In the future, the thirteen clans of the Qin heaven would have the Kong Xuan sect as their leader. How could they not be happy?</p><p>Just as everyone was happily cleaning up the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt a chill in his heart. He suddenly raised his head and shouted, ” “Who is it?”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming finished speaking, a jet-black Saber Light slashed down from the sky.</p><p>The saber Light was extremely fast. It was not aimed at Lu Ming, but at the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s ancestor’s expression changed drastically. With a roar, his divine power erupted. He pushed his hands out continuously and instantly, dozens of ice walls were laid out above his head.</p><p>However, when the pitch-black blade-light slashed down, the ice walls shattered one after another. In an instant, dozens of ice walls had been cut open.</p><p>The blade light did not stop and continued to slash at the ice Soul clan’s ancestor.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s ancestor was cut in half.</p><p>Fortunately, the ice Soul clan’s ancestor managed to avoid his head at the critical moment. Only his body was struck, but he was still severely injured.</p><p>“Fifth level Godking!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s ancestor shouted in fear.</p><p>&Nbsp; he could sense that the person who had just attacked was a fifth level Divine King.</p><p>“What? Fifth level Godking?”</p><p>The others were also shocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this time, a terrifying aura came from the sky, and a terrifying pressure pressed down on them.</p><p>Then, some black-robed men appeared in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and discovered that there were a total of eighteen black-robed men. They were spread out in all directions, keeping a distance from each other. Each of them exuded a terrifying aura and locked onto everyone at the scene, especially Lu Ming.</p><p>Each of them gave off a terrifying aura. Even the weakest one was no weaker than the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>“The most … The weaker ones are all at the fourth level of the Godking realm!”</p><p>The ice Soul clan’s ancestor’s face was pale.</p><p>The others were equally shocked.</p><p>The weakest of the eighteen black-robed men was at the fourth level of the divine King realm. Some of them had terrifying auras that were many times stronger than the fourth level of the divine King realm.</p><p>He was definitely at the fifth level of the Godking realm or higher.</p><p>Why did so many experts appear here all of a sudden? moreover, they seemed to have come with ill intentions.</p><p>I thought we didn’t have to do anything. I didn’t expect those people to be so useless!</p><p>One of the black-robed men said coldly. His face could not be seen clearly, but one could feel his cold gaze on Lu Ming.</p><p>“It looks like you’re here to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“You’re quite smart, not bad. But you can also get rid of everyone here!”</p><p>The black-robed man who spoke just now was filled with killing intent.</p><p>The people from the ice Soul Clan and the Kong Xuan sect all turned pale.</p><p>If these experts wanted to kill them, they would be dead for sure.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had the king’s suppression tower, how could he deal with so many experts?</p><p>“Who sent you? Jin family? The winged ones ‘family? N-no, I won’t …”</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming paused for a moment. His eyes lit up and he said,”You guys were sent by the person who stole the nine absolute God crystal?”</p><p>The black-robed men were silent and did not speak.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that he had guessed correctly.</p><p>The Jin family, the winged people family, and the Qin family were all being watched by the Wu family. It would be impossible for them to send so many experts without anyone knowing.</p><p>There was only one possibility, the other party was sent by the person who stole the nine absolute God crystal.</p><p>Lu Ming was not shocked. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>Perhaps this time, they would be able to find the mastermind. Who was it?</p><p>don’t waste your breath on them. Attack and kill them to avoid any trouble!</p><p>The other black-robed man said coldly and slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of this strike was earth-shattering and was several times stronger than the one he had used on the ice Soul clan’s patriarch.</p><p>&Nbsp; this person’s cultivation had most likely surpassed the fifth level of the divine King realm and reached the sixth level.</p><p>In the face of such an expert, Lu Ming was of no use at all. The difference in strength was too great. Only death awaited him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had the bone demon by his side.</p><p>Bone demon hadn’t made a move before, not even when the boundless sacred land’s Saint Lord had escaped, just in case.</p><p>“Senior bone, I’ll leave it to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bone demon.</p><p>“Am I finally going to make a move?”</p><p>The bone demon chuckled and appeared in front of Lu Ming. It extended a finger and flicked it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a flick of bone’s finger, the air exploded violently, and an extremely terrifying force rushed forward.</p><p>The black-robed man’s blade light was like paper. It fell apart under the terrifying force.</p><p>Then, the force pressed down on the black-robed man.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The black-robed man only had time to let out a scream before his body was turned into dust by the force.</p><p>He had killed a suspected sixth firmament Divine King with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The scene fell into a deathly silence.</p><p>Everyone, including the remaining black-robed men, looked at bone demon in shock.</p><p>A terrifying expert was killed by the bone demon with a snap of his fingers. What kind of existence was this?</p><p>not good! The enemy has a terrifying expert! Retreat!</p><p>One of the black-robed men reacted and shouted.</p><p>They knew very well that the black-robed man who had been killed earlier was a genuine sixth level Divine King expert. To be able to kill a sixth level Divine King with a snap of his finger, he must be at least at the eighth level of the divine King realm or even higher.</p><p>Facing such a powerhouse, no matter how many people they had, they would still die.</p><p>These black-robed men were very decisive. Their bodies flashed and they rushed in one direction, trying to escape.</p><p>“You want to escape under my eyes? laughable!”</p><p>Bone said coldly, then opened his mouth and inhaled.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying suction force burst out of the bone demon’s mouth, sweeping across the sky and enveloping all the black-robed men.</p><p>The black-robed figures froze, and then they flew back towards the mouth of the bone Devil.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
