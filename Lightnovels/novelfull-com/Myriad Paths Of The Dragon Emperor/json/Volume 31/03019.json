I can challenge the first row and use the power of the first row to completely awaken the origin divine power factor!</p><p>Qin Wushang mumbled, his eyes brimming with confidence.</p><p>Before, his Shen power had not awakened to such a high level, so he had not dared to challenge the first row. After a period of cultivation, he had full confidence.</p><p>Of course, he did not dare to challenge the genius who had awakened the origin divine power factor. He wanted to challenge the other two people.</p><p>“Cousin Wu Kong!”</p><p>At this time, the Qin clan’s heaven’s favorite in the crowd shouted.</p><p>“Is there something?”</p><p>Qin Wukong turned around and said.</p><p>“Qin Mu has been killed!”</p><p>The Qin clan’s chosen said.</p><p>“Eh? Qin Mu was killed? Who was it? Which aristocratic family did it?”</p><p>Upon hearing these words, a cold killing intent erupted from Qin Wukong’s body. His cold gaze swept across the surroundings. The expressions of those who were caught by his gaze changed and their hearts beat faster.</p><p>Among the heaven’s pride experts in the universal camp who were below the God King stage, Qin Wukong was definitely considered as one of the top experts.</p><p>it’s him, Lu Ming. It’s Lu Ming who killed Qin Mu!</p><p>The Qin clan’s Paragon pointed at Lu Ming, who was cultivating.</p><p>Subconsciously, Qin Wukong’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming. He could not help but be stunned.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, this position belonged to Jin Jue. Why did it become Lu Ming’s?</p><p>“Lu Ming, he can kill Qin Mu?”</p><p>Qin Wukong’s deep voice sounded with some doubt.</p><p>this kid is very powerful. You can’t just look at his cultivation. Jin Jue, the pride of the Jin clan, was also killed by him!</p><p>Jin Xing said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>This time, Qin Wukong was truly shocked.</p><p>Qin Mu was still fine as he was only a ninth level heavenly God. However, Jin Jue was no small matter. He was an existence at the half-step Divine King realm, yet he had actually died at the hands of Lu Ming.</p><p>“This brat can’t be left alive!”</p><p>Qin Wukong had this thought.</p><p>“What is this kid’s cultivation level?”</p><p>Qin Wukong asked.</p><p>fifth level celestial deity, but his combat strength is shocking. At least equivalent to a half-step Divine King with a degree of 70 – 80% divine power awakening!</p><p>Jin Xing said.</p><p>“Such strength? Alright, leave this brat to me. When his three months are up, I’ll challenge him and kill him here!”</p><p>Qin Wukong’s voice was incomparably cold.</p><p>Although Lu Ming could kill Jin Jue, he was confident that he could kill Lu Ming as well.</p><p>Now, his Shen power had awakened to ninety-nine percent. Adding on the fact that the maturity of his Shen skills was shocking, he was confident.</p><p>Apart from the few people who had awakened the origin divine power factor, he was invincible among those below the God King level.</p><p>“With brother Wu Kong taking action, that brat is dead for sure!”</p><p>Jin Xing was overjoyed. He looked at Lu Ming with an even more ferocious gaze.</p><p>Next, Qin Wukong did not cultivate. He stood on the stone platform and waited quietly.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming was completely unaware of all this. He was completely focused on comprehending the God’s divine power.</p><p>As expected of the second row of stone platforms, the effect was simply too good. It was not something that the lower rows could compare to. The difference in effect was tens of times.</p><p>Lu Ming’s awakening level of the ruler’s divine power was rapidly increasing.</p><p>With the increase in the degree of awakening of the God’s divine power, Lu Ming’s strength had also improved.</p><p>Very quickly, three months had passed.</p><p>The universe and the starry sky disappeared. Lu Ming opened his eyes on the stone platform.</p><p>“88%!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The degree of awakening of the ruler’s divine power had reached 88%.</p><p>Lu Ming had only been cultivating here for nine months and his awakening of ruler’s divine power had increased from one to two percent to eighty-eight percent. If others were to know about this, their jaws would probably drop.</p><p>This speed was too shocking.</p><p>I really don’t know how amazing the effects of the first row are. With my current strength, I should be able to challenge the first row!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and then stood up.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming stood up, he felt a strong pressure pressing down on him. At the same time, a young man appeared in front of him, staring at him coldly.</p><p>This young man was naturally Qin Wukong.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming woke up, Qin Wukong rushed to Lu Ming’s stone platform.</p><p>it’s him. Hehe, I didn’t look for him, but he did look for me. That’s good!</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>“Kid, you can still laugh at a time like this?”</p><p>Qin Wukong said coldly.</p><p>“Why can’t I laugh? you’re here to die, so of course I have to laugh!”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to smile.</p><p>I’m here to die. Haha, looks like you’re very confident after defeating a few people. I want to see how strong your combat power is as a fifth level celestial deity!</p><p>Qin Wukong said coldly. As he spoke, a dazzling radiance burst forth from his body. His divine power burned like flames, stirring up a terrifying Gale that crushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>An ancient aura bloomed wantonly.</p><p>“The origin divine power factor, no, it hasn’t awakened yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. He thought that Qin Wukong had awakened the divine force factor. However, after sensing carefully, he realized that Qin Wukong had not awakened the divine force factor at all. However, he was not far from awakening it.</p><p>so powerful. I’m afraid Qin Wukong’s divine power has already awakened to ninety-nine percent!</p><p>Among the crowd, there were some knowledgeable people who had seen through Qin Wukong’s background.</p><p>with such an aura, he’s indeed just one step away from completely awakening the origin divine power factor. This will be interesting.</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>Lu Ming was a monstrous existence. He was able to kill a half-step Divine King like Jin Jue even though he was only at the fifth level heavenly deity realm. Then, could he fight with Qin Wukong?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Wukong made his move. He threw out a punch and a huge fist print headed towards Lu Ming at an astonishing speed.</p><p>ancient God Body!</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ming cast his ancient God Body and activated the battle character formula that multiplied his combat power by four.</p><p>Facing an opponent like Qin Wukong, Lu Ming had no choice but to go all out.</p><p>The long spear trembled and a dazzling spear radiance broke through the air, piercing toward Qin Wukong’s fist imprint.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The spear radiance and the fist print collided, causing a terrifying energy wave to erupt and sweep in all directions.</p><p>Fortunately, the heaven’s favorites cultivating on the other stone platforms were protected by the formation. The energy didn’t affect them in the slightest. Otherwise, they would have been seriously injured or even killed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The spear radiance shook continuously and then exploded. At the same time, the huge fist print also exploded.</p><p>“I blocked it!”</p><p>“Lu Ming could actually block Qin Wukong’s punch!”</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>Qin Wukong’s eyes also focused.</p><p>“This kid is a monster. Kill him!”</p><p>Qin Wukong gave a low roar and pushed his divine power to the limit.</p><p>The power of his divine power, which had awakened to ninety-nine percent, burst out in full force, turning into a terrifying fist print that blasted toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
