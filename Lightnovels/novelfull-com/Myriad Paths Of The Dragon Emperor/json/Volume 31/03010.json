The white-haired young man walked towards Lu Ming and the absolute beauty while the other four walked towards the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>The myriad rivers ice vine suddenly launched an attack and one of the ninth level celestial deity youths was killed immediately. The other eight vines danced wildly and attacked the other three youths.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Two of the young men reacted slightly faster and exploded with attacks to block, but they were still hit by the vines. Their bodies were sent flying and they crashed into the wall, spitting out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>There was another woman who was not so lucky. Her reaction was slightly slower and she was immediately entangled by a vine.</p><p>The temperature of the vines was shockingly low. As the woman was wrapped by the vines, her body was immediately covered in a layer of ice.</p><p>The vine pulled the woman toward its big mouth.</p><p>“Help, help …”</p><p>The woman struggled with all her might and screamed.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>The white-haired young man roared. He took a step forward and rushed toward the myriad rivers ice vine. In the process, he turned into an Ice Snow Lion and roared. A terrifying storm rushed toward the myriad rivers ice vine.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The white-haired young man’s attack landed on the vines of the myriad rivers ice vine, causing a violent vibration. However, the vines of the myriad rivers ice vine were extremely tough, so the white-haired young man’s attack couldn’t break them at all.</p><p>The vine was still pulling the woman into the mouth.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The woman cried out in despair.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>The white-haired young man roared as he continuously struck out with his sharp claws. His claws were like the blades of a Divine Blade as he clawed at the vines.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sharp claws scratched the rattan, making a sound of metal clashing. Sparks flew in all directions, but they could only leave a few marks on the rattan.</p><p>Even the most beautiful woman couldn’t break the vines, so the white-haired young man naturally couldn’t either.</p><p>At this moment, the other two young men who had been sent flying by the vines also pounced over. They transformed into Ice Snow lions and fought with the vines.</p><p>However, it was of no help.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The vine wrapped around the woman and threw her into its mouth. The woman’s cry suddenly stopped, and there was no sound.</p><p>The myriad rivers ice Vine’s mouth was filled with a terrifying chill. The woman was thrown in and naturally couldn’t resist it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>After devouring the woman, the myriad river ice vine roared madly. The nine vines rushed towards the white-haired young man and the other two madly. The shadows of the vines covered the sky and enveloped the three of them.</p><p>At this moment, even if the white-haired young man and the other two wanted to escape, it would be difficult. They tried to attack a few times, but were blocked by the vines.</p><p>“I’ll fight you to the death!”</p><p>The white-haired young man roared and fought with the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>“My strength is not as good as before!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He realized that the strength of the myriad rivers ice vine was much weaker than when he was fighting with them. Otherwise, the white-haired young man and the others would have been in danger.</p><p>But now, the white-haired young man and the other two were able to fight against the myriad river ice vine.</p><p>“I didn’t expect this ice vine to have a secondary core!”</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Sub-core?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>that’s right. This myriad rivers ice vine has a sub-core in addition to its main core. Just now, when you shattered the main core, the myriad rivers ice vine wasn’t completely dead. It was awakening its sub-core!</p><p>however, a sub-core is a sub-core after all. It’s far from being comparable to the main core. It seems that this ice Vine’s spiritual intelligence has been greatly reduced. It has already gone crazy and only knows how to attack. Its strength has also been greatly reduced!</p><p>The quantity formula explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood. He could not help but secretly rejoice in his heart.</p><p>It turned out that the myriad rivers ice vine had a sub-core. Fortunately, the white-haired young man and the rest had come. Otherwise, if Lu Ming had gone to retrieve the gem on the myriad rivers ice Vine’s head and the myriad rivers ice vine suddenly woke up and attacked, the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>“This won’t do. If this goes on, the winner will be decided very soon. At that time, it will be disadvantageous for both of us. We must absorb the cold Qi from her body as soon as possible. Old Liang, can’t you be faster?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to the quantity formula.</p><p>if I hurry, I’ll be easily exposed. And your palms are separated by palms, too far from her heart and brain. The heart and brain are both fragile parts. If I increase my strength, the cold air will hurt her heart and brain!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Then how can we increase the speed?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>it’s simple. Place one hand on her forehead and the other on her heart. This way, I’ll be able to perform better when we’re closer!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a difficult position.</p><p>It was fine if it was stuck to the forehead, but if it was stuck to the girl’s heart, it was a little …</p><p>“Hurry up! You’re a man and yet you’re still so wishy-washy! Don’t say that I didn’t warn you when the outcome of the battle is decided!”</p><p>The quantity formula called out.</p><p>“Then … Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming gritted his teeth and stared at the beautiful woman.”Miss, you can see the situation now. In order to save you as soon as possible, I’m sorry!”</p><p>With that, Lu Ming placed one hand on the beautiful woman’s forehead and his other hand on her heart.</p><p>“You … What are you doing? No, don’t …”</p><p>The woman cried out.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not be bothered with her. He placed his palm on the woman’s heart.</p><p>The woman’s voice stopped abruptly. She stared at Lu Ming with her big, watery eyes.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with anger, shyness, and other complicated emotions. Her originally white face had also turned red.</p><p>‘Cough cough …’</p><p>Being stared at so intently, Lu Ming could not help but feel a little embarrassed despite his thick skin. He coughed a few times and said to the quantity word formula, ” “Old Liang, you’d better hurry!”</p><p>“Leave it to me …”</p><p>The ” quantity ” formula glowed. A strong suction force flowed along Lu Ming’s palm and entered the beautiful woman’s heart and brain, absorbing the cold air in her body.</p><p>The cold Qi in her body was absorbed by the ” Liang ” word art at an alarming rate. The ice on the beautiful woman’s body quickly melted and disappeared. Her body gradually regained its warmth.</p><p>At this moment, the battle between the three-headed Snow Lion and the myriad river ice vine had already entered a state of white heat.</p><p>Although the myriad rivers ice vine only had its sub-core left, it had lost its intelligence and was completely mad. Its combat strength was also extremely terrifying, suppressing the three-headed Snow Lion.</p><p>Finally, one of the frost Lions couldn’t hold on any longer and an ice vine pierced through its head, killing it on the spot.</p><p>As such, only the white-haired youth and the other youth were left.</p><p>“Third brother, what should we do? Are we going to die Here?”</p><p>The other young man said in fear. This young man was also a half-step Divine King. He was slightly weaker than the white-haired young man, but he was still very strong.</p><p>They had tried many times to rush out, but the nine vines were waving so tightly that they were airtight, completely blocking their retreat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
