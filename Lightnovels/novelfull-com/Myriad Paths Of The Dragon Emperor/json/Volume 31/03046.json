I’m from the nine Serenities Heavenly King residence, the nine Serenities sect. You probably don’t know how powerful my nine Serenities Heavenly King residence is. If you kill me, the nine Serenities Heavenly King residence will make you pay back tenfold!</p><p>You Lian roared.</p><p>The nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor used to be the nine Serenities sect. It was an extremely terrifying and powerful sect, and its methods were strange and cruel. It was especially protective of its own.</p><p>Therefore, you Lian had brought up the nine Serenities Heavenly King Manor and even mentioned the name nine Serenities sect in order to save his life.</p><p>However, this move was ineffective against Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had stepped on the bones of the paragons along the way. How many paragons had he killed? How much threat did he receive?</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was completely immune to such threats.</p><p>Moreover, you Lian knew that he controlled many types of divine-grade divine energy. How could Lu Ming let him leave?</p><p>“You talk too much nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said disdainfully. He swung his long spear down and a crescent-shaped spear ray slashed you Lian’s body.</p><p>You Lian cried out in pain as his body crumbled apart once more, turning into vengeful spirits that let out shrill cries. After that, they slowly gathered together again, trying to gather together.</p><p>his vitality is really strong. Star explosion!</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then cast the star explosion.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A spear radiance shot out and exploded. Waves of destructive power enveloped all the vengeful souls.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>These vengeful souls all exploded and turned into black smoke before disappearing.</p><p>You Lian had completely disappeared.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a sigh of relief. His body shrank and returned to his normal form.</p><p>This you Lian was really difficult to kill. Among the opponents that Lu Ming had encountered, he was definitely the most difficult to deal with.</p><p>His attacks weren’t very strong, but he had strange methods that could affect the soul and weaken the opponent’s strength, killing them.</p><p>This time, if Lu Ming did not have Jing Yu’s portrait, he would not have been you Lian’s match. The best outcome would have been for him to flee.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming walked toward the two small boxes. With a wave of his hand, he kept the two boxes and left the place in a flash.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming found a quiet room. He consumed a divine pill and began to channel his energy to regulate his breathing.</p><p>When Lu Ming’s condition had almost recovered, he took out the two boxes.</p><p>On the box, there were lines of runes that formed a large formation. It was probably used to protect the items inside the box and prevent the loss of spirituality.</p><p>However, after so many years, the array of the chest had been worn out by time and its light had dimmed.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine power and infused it into the box, wanting to open it.</p><p>The runes on the box glowed dimly and were slowly worn out by Lu Ming’s divine energy. Not long after, the runes disappeared completely and Lu Ming opened the box.</p><p>Inside the box, there were some items neatly placed.</p><p>There was a pair of bracelets, a small Pagoda, and a mirror …</p><p>“Treasures, divine artifacts …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>These things should be treasures like divine artifacts.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up a small Pagoda and carefully injected divine power into it. Instantly, the small Pagoda emitted a dazzling glow and a strong wave of fluctuation spread out.</p><p>“There’s also a spirit!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>However, after careful observation, he realized that these treasures still had spirituality. However, because too much time had passed, even with the protection of the protective formation, a lot of the spirituality had been lost, at least 90%.</p><p>He could barely use it.</p><p>although they’ve lost a lot of their spirituality, the materials used to create these treasures are no trivial matter. Even if they can’t be of much use, you can still give them to QiuQiu to eat. I believe QiuQiu will have a great harvest.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming smiled and continued to open the second box.</p><p>The second box also contained some treasures. Just like the first box, it had lost a lot of its spirituality.</p><p>Lu Ming collected all these treasures in a storage ring. He planned to study them slowly after leaving star-moon ancient city. If they were useful, he would keep them. If not, he would give them to QiuQiu.</p><p>After putting it away, Lu Ming got up and left the place to continue his exploration.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not gain anything after that.</p><p>After going left and right, Lu Ming finally found another passage. He followed the passage and went forward.</p><p>There was nothing unusual along the way. After passing through the passage, Lu Ming came to a platform.</p><p>The platform was huge, and there were already many people gathered there.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was attracted to the front.</p><p>Because in front of the platform, there was only chaos. There was no path.</p><p>The road was cut off here.</p><p>“What’s going on? There’s actually no path here, could this be the end?”</p><p>it shouldn’t be. We’ve explored all the other places and they were all dead ends. Only this place has a passage. It’s reasonable to say that there should be a way ahead!</p><p>Many people were discussing.</p><p>the difficult path is blocked by this land of chaos. I’ll blast this land of chaos open!</p><p>A young man walked to the front of the platform, circulated his divine power, and struck out a few palm strikes.</p><p>A huge palm print formed and struck towards the land of chaos, but the mist churned and the youth’s palm force was like a stone sinking into the ocean. It didn’t cause any ripples.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>The young man didn’t give up and continued to attack, but it was useless.</p><p>don’t waste your energy. We’ve already tried it. It’s useless!</p><p>Someone said. Clearly, some of the geniuses who had arrived earlier had already tried.</p><p>“Then what do we do?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>the only thing we can do now is wait. I estimate that after some time, there might be changes!</p><p>“I also think so!”</p><p>A few young men spoke up.</p><p>The crowd was silent. Some people found a place to sit down and waited quietly.</p><p>It wasn’t easy for them to come here, and they were really unwilling to leave just like that.</p><p>Lu Ming also found a place to sit cross-legged, comprehending the divine energy while waiting.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days had passed. However, the land of chaos was still blurry and there was no change at all.</p><p>As time passed, more and more Young heaven’s favorites arrived.</p><p>A month later, thousands of heaven’s favorites had gathered here.</p><p>However, Lu Ming estimated that only a portion of the paragons who had entered the castle had come because many had not seen them.</p><p>For example, Jin Yuan, you han, Chu baxing, and the others were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Yan and the young man in animal hide had also arrived.</p><p>Time flew by, and another month passed.</p><p>To the gods, a few months passed in the blink of an eye, so they were not impatient.</p><p>“There’s movement over there!”</p><p>“There’s someone in the chaos!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes looked towards the chaos.</p><p>At first, it was misty and filled with gray mist, and he couldn’t see what was inside at all.</p><p>Before this, someone had even flown in to investigate. The inside was boundless, and they could not tell the direction.</p><p>But now, the fog churned, and a figure actually walked out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
