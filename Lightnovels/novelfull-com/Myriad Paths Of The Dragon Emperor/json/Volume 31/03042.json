How many years has it been since the beginning of the era of the heavenly Palace? the formation that has been carved hasn’t decayed and is still working?”</p><p>Someone said in disbelief.</p><p>Many people’s faces turned grave. From this, one could see how terrifying the person who set up the formation was. His strength was simply unfathomable.</p><p>It was definitely an existence above Godking, or even stronger.</p><p>Only those extremely terrifying existences could inscribe runes that were still effective even after so many years.</p><p>no one can escape the judgment of time. Even the most powerful existence will fall. It’s the same for runes. Runes are carved with energy. After such a long time, I don’t believe that the formation can still maintain its power. I guess there’s only a little bit of energy left!</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>Many people nodded in agreement.</p><p>However, no one stepped forward.</p><p>Even so, what if the remaining energy of the formation in front was enough to kill them? if they went forward, wouldn’t they still be dead?</p><p>“We’ll know once we try controlling the divine artifact!”</p><p>Someone took out a divine combat sword and flew forward.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>When the divine weapon sword flew past, it seemed to have been sensed. Runes appeared on both sides of the passage.</p><p>Then, a beam of divine light flashed and struck the divine weapon.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The divine combat sword trembled a little and left a shallow mark on it.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the channel runes continued to flash, and a few more beams of divine light blasted toward the divine weapon combat sword.</p><p>The divine weapon battle sword kept shaking, but it was not broken. It only left a shallow mark on it.</p><p>“I can block it!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The power of this formation was not that strong.</p><p>&Nbsp; just now, that God artifact had been a high-quality level nine God artifact. If a high-quality level nine God artifact could block it, then they would be able to pass.</p><p>Everyone present was a top-notch genius. Who didn’t have a few level nine high-grade divine artifacts?</p><p>“Let’s try going forward!”</p><p>Then, a few more people controlled the divine weapons and flew forward.</p><p>There had always been formations in front of him, but they were all blocked by the divine artifacts and could not be broken through.</p><p>haha, as expected, after so many years, there’s not much power left in this formation. We can pass through!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>One of the young men laughed. A suit of armor appeared on his body and covered him.</p><p>This armor was an upper ninth-grade defensive divine artifact.</p><p>After putting on the armor, the young man stepped forward. As soon as he entered the area of the formation, the runes shone, and divine light shot toward him. However, the divine light bombarded the armor and was blocked.</p><p>This person continued to move forward, going deeper and deeper.</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go too!”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>More people stepped forward and took out all kinds of defensive divine weapons.</p><p>Some people took out their shields, while others took out their battle armors and put them on. Then, they rushed into the tunnel.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>On the walls and ground of the passage, runes kept shining, turning into divine light to attack them. They hit all kinds of defensive divine artifacts, making violent vibrations, as if they were forging iron.</p><p>However, the power of these divine lights was limited. They kept moving forward, and many people disappeared before their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming also took out two defensive divine artifacts to protect himself and rushed forward.</p><p>Along the way, they did not encounter too many dangers.</p><p>There was a limited amount of energy left in these formations, and some sections did not even produce any runes. They passed through the passage smoothly.</p><p>When they successfully passed through the passage, they reached the end.</p><p>At the end of the passage was another huge secret room.</p><p>There were some shelves in the secret room. On them were some Jade bottles and some weapons.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up and they rushed over.</p><p>Someone quickly grabbed a weapon.</p><p>However, when they picked up their weapons and shook them, they were immediately shattered into pieces and fell to the ground.</p><p>“It’s useless, it’s become scrap metal!”</p><p>That person muttered.</p><p>The others were in a similar situation. They picked up the weapons on the shelves, only to find that they had all become scrap metal and had lost their spirituality.</p><p>Some people picked up the Jade bottles and found that the Jade bottles were filled with divine pills. However, because too much time had passed, the divine pills had lost their medicinal effects and became useless.</p><p>AI!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>He had come here after much effort and discovered treasures, but they were all useless.</p><p>It couldn’t be that there was nothing left in this Castle, and everything had become scrap metal!</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>I don’t think so. Some peerless treasures can retain their power even after so many years. There are also some treasures that can retain their power if they are protected by a large array, and the loss of spirituality is much slower!</p><p>these treasures aren’t of high grade, and they don’t have a formation to protect them. That’s why they’re like this!</p><p>Someone said. Then, everyone started to look around.</p><p>He found that there were doors in all directions of the secret room. The doors were open, but he did not know where they led to.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Someone moved and rushed towards a large door.</p><p>Then, the others also moved and rushed to the other door.</p><p>They had passed through many obstacles. Logically speaking, it was time for them to reap the rewards. Perhaps, there were treasures with intact spiritual qualities left behind.</p><p>In particular, the life Soul Origin stone that was heavily protected was even more tempting.</p><p>Lu Ming also rushed to a door.</p><p>Behind the door was a corridor. As he walked along the corridor, he found many rooms.</p><p>There were quite a few people who went in this direction. Everyone was exploring the rooms, but unfortunately, they didn’t find anything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent roar came from the front. Clearly, someone was fighting.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed and he rushed forward. After passing through a corridor, he came to a courtyard.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming arrived, he saw a few young men fighting intensely.</p><p>And in this courtyard, there were a few large boxes.</p><p>There were runes flashing on the chests.</p><p>It was obvious that a formation had been set up to protect the treasure in the box. It was very likely that the treasure in the box still retained its spirituality.</p><p>This was left behind by many powerful existences at the beginning of the heavenly Palace era. Any treasure would probably be worth a city.</p><p>These people’s eyes were red as they fought intensely.</p><p>“I found this place first, get lost!”</p><p>A young man shouted.</p><p>“Don’t you know that whoever sees it will have a share?”</p><p>The other young man sneered.</p><p>“Then die!”</p><p>The young man from before shouted.</p><p>However, as more and more people arrived, the courtyard fell into a chaotic battle.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not take action immediately.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be better to sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight?</p><p>There were quite a few others who had the same thoughts as him. There were a few other young men standing by the side.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a cold, murderous intent rushing toward him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
