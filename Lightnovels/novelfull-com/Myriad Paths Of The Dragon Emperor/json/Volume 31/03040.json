There are more than a dozen of them who have awakened the origin divine power factor. With so many experts, we won’t be able to gain any benefits if we go in. It’s better not to go in!</p><p>Wu zixiong shook his head and said helplessly.</p><p>To be honest, they were also tempted by the sudden appearance of an underground Castle, but they knew their own limits.</p><p>There were many heaven’s pride experts who were much stronger than them. There were also many who could kill them. Even if they entered, even if there were treasures inside, they wouldn’t be able to compete with the others. On the contrary, there was a risk of death. It was better to try their luck in other places of star-moon ancient city.</p><p>Now that most of the heaven’s favorites have entered the castle, if you encounter any opportunities in other places, you won’t be able to compete.</p><p>Those who had the same thoughts as Wu zixiong and the others were not in the minority. Of course, they were all not particularly strong.</p><p>“That’s good too, but I plan to go in and take a look!”</p><p>“Oh right, during this period of time, have you guys found the whereabouts of my girlfriend Qiu Yue?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked with an expectant look.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wu Yue, Wu Ming, and the others shook their heads and said, ” we’ve asked many people during this time, but unfortunately, we didn’t get any news!</p><p>“No news?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, feeling more and more worried.</p><p>However, star-moon ancient city was incomparably huge. If he were asked to search for it, how could he find it in a short amount of time?</p><p>He could only hope that Qiuyue was blessed by the heavens.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble the few of you to help me keep an eye on Qiu Yue’s news!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, don’t worry!”</p><p>Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the others cupped their fists.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, then turned around and rushed towards the castle.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>Immediately, a few treants waved their roots and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll burn you all with a fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming was in a bad mood. He circulated his sun divine power and stabbed a few times.</p><p>A few spear lights condensed from the sun Shen power struck the tree demon’s roots. The sun Shen power immediately turned into flames and burned the tree demon’s roots. Then, it flowed through the tree demon’s roots and into its entire body at an astonishing speed.</p><p>A few tree demons quickly turned to ashes under the burning sun Shen power.</p><p>Whoosh … Whoosh …</p><p>The treants were afraid of fire. Wherever Lu Ming went, the treants would burn and turn into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming easily dashed past the tree demon’s snipe and rushed inside.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that I can’t fly inside!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. When he came out, he did not have any restrictions.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming scanned the room.</p><p>There was no need to enter the door that he had come out of previously. Lu Ming had explored the inside previously and there was nothing inside.</p><p>Around the castle, there were ancient bluestone roads that led to different directions.</p><p>The people who had rushed here before had all chosen different ancient paths to advance.</p><p>which one should I choose? forget it, I’ll just pick one!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. He then randomly chose a path and rushed forward.</p><p>Lu Ming walked along the path until he reached the end. He discovered another door.</p><p>A few figures flashed and rushed through the door.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and rushed in as well.</p><p>Behind the door was a very long passage. Lu Ming walked for more than a hundred miles before he reached the end of the passage.</p><p>At the end of the passage was a huge stone room.</p><p>The stone room was extremely large and spacious.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming entered, he saw many young geniuses standing on the stone room and looking around.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the front and his expression changed.</p><p>On one side of the stone chamber, there were many figures sitting cross-legged.</p><p>However, these figures had already become skeletons.</p><p>That’s right, there were skeletons sitting there. At a glance, there were about 300 of them.</p><p>These figures were of different races. There were humans, dragonmen, Tigermen, and so on. Their clothes were all tattered, and only skeletons were left.</p><p>The skeleton was also gray and dull.</p><p>“Could these people be experts from star-moon ancient city?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>this Castle is buried deep underground. These people are most likely experts from star-moon ancient city!</p><p>“Isn’t he a figure from the beginning of the heavenly Palace era? It’s been so many years, but the bone insect is still intact. What cultivation level were these people when they were alive?”</p><p>Some people discussed and revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>As far as they knew, even a peak God King couldn’t have kept the bone banner after so many years. It would have turned into ashes long ago.</p><p>If these skeletons were really preserved from the early days of the heavenly Palace era, they must have an amazing origin.</p><p>Unfortunately, everyone’s eyes swept over these skeleton fingers and found nothing.</p><p>They had wanted to see if there were any storage rings left, but too much time had passed and even their storage rings had turned to dust.</p><p>“These people don’t seem to have any injuries. How did they die?”</p><p>Someone suddenly spoke.</p><p>The entire place was silent.</p><p>&Nbsp; yeah.</p><p>These skeletons looked very complete without the slightest wound. They didn’t look like they were killed by someone.</p><p>Moreover, they were all sitting cross-legged in a neat formation, as if they were guarding something.</p><p>Could it be that these people were sitting here and eventually died of old age?</p><p>A thought appeared in everyone’s mind, leaving them dumbfounded.</p><p>The idea of sitting here and dying of old age was really a little outrageous.</p><p>However, the scene in front of them made them think so.</p><p>“There’s a stone gate on the other side. Could it be that these people are sitting here to guard that stone gate?”</p><p>Another person spoke, causing many people’s eyes to light up.</p><p>Indeed, there was a stone door behind these skeletons that was tightly shut.</p><p>Could it be that there was an important treasure inside, and that was why these people were sitting cross-legged here to guard this place?</p><p>However, no one stepped forward.</p><p>Who knew if there was any danger ahead?</p><p>No one even dared to touch the skeletons.</p><p>These people were most likely extremely powerful when they were alive. Even if they had died many years ago, if they had left behind any tricks, with their cultivation, they would most likely have to bear the consequences.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, hoping that someone else would go first.</p><p>this place was left behind at the beginning of the era of the heavenly Palace. So many years have passed. No matter what it is, it should have disappeared. Even if it’s a formation, it can’t be maintained for so many years. I don’t believe there’s still danger!</p><p>Finally, someone couldn’t take it anymore. A young man shouted and stepped out, walking towards the door.</p><p>However, he was still afraid and didn’t dare to touch the skeletons. Instead, he walked around the skeletons and walked toward the stone door. There was nothing unusual along the way, and the young man arrived in front of the stone door smoothly.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes fell on the young man with curiosity and anticipation.</p><p>Some of them were even prepared to fight for the treasures behind the stone door if they were to find any.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The young man pushed with all his might!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
