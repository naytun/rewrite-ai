He also used his full power and transformed into a green-armored ancient God, waving his spear and sweeping it out.</p><p>The two huge spearlights collided.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fighting ring kept shaking as if two planets had collided. Violent energy swept out in all directions. Countless tiny spear lights shot out in all directions, but they were blocked by the light shield on the fighting ring.</p><p>The force swept out, and Lu Ming and Chu baxing’s bodies trembled as they retreated.</p><p>green-armored ancient God!</p><p>Chu BA Xing growled, revealing a shocked expression.</p><p>it’s the green-armored ancient God!</p><p>what powerful strength! He actually blocked Chu BA Xing’s attack!</p><p>Xu Yan and the rest were all shocked. They looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually cultivated to become a green-armored ancient God and his combat power was so strong that he could actually fight against Chu baxing.</p><p>“Chu BA Xing, is that all you’ve got?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your abilities have indeed exceeded my expectations. However, you’re still far from being able to contend with me!”</p><p>die! Chu BA Xing shouted coldly. His body glowed brilliantly, especially his armor, which emitted a blinding light like a star.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He took a step forward like a giant and charged at Lu Ming. The spear radiance was like a mountain, shaking the void.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming was fearless as he brandished his spear and charged forward. In the process, nine-clawed divine Dragons condensed in the void and pounced towards Chu baxing.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them collided once again. This time, both of them were mentally prepared. They exerted their strength to the extreme and continued to collide with each other. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged dozens of moves. It was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>“God of War’s strike!”</p><p>Chu baxing roared, unleashing his true fire and his most powerful attack.</p><p>A gigantic God of War appeared on the fighting ring and thrust his spear at Lu Ming at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a surge of terrifying power rushing towards him. This surge of power had locked onto him, making it difficult for him to Dodge. He could only take it head-on.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. All the divine power in his body gathered towards the long spear, then turned into a spear ray and burst out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge spear light rushed out and collided with Chu baxing’s God of War. Lu Ming’s spear light exploded with a bang, and the destructive power swept towards the God of War.</p><p>The terrifying power completely drowned the fighting ring. Lu Ming and Chu baxing kept retreating until they reached the edge of the fighting ring.</p><p>After a few breaths, the energy dissipated. Everyone could see that cracks had appeared on Chu baxing’s God of War.</p><p>Everyone’s gazes focused, somewhat in disbelief.</p><p>Chu baxing’s Ares attack was not only blocked by Lu Ming, but it was also cracked. This was too terrifying.</p><p>One had to know that Chu baxing’s move was extremely powerful and invincible. When he had used this move before, he had directly broken Jin Yuan’s strongest attack and defeated him.</p><p>Even you han did not dare to take this attack head-on. However, not only did Lu Ming take it head-on, but he also created a crack in the God of War’s attack.</p><p>“This guy’s strength has increased again!”</p><p>Jin Yuan murmured. He looked at Lu Ming with deep fear in his eyes.</p><p>Back then, when Lu Ming fought against Jin Yuan, although he won in the end, it was not an easy victory. Chu baxing defeated Jin Yuan with ease.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s final three apocalyptic strikes had broken through one stage and reached the eighth stage. Whether it was when he used sky piercer, moon slash, or exploding stars, the power of these three moves had all increased. Now, Lu Ming’s offensive power was no longer below Chu baxing’s.</p><p>Chu BA Xing’s pupils also contracted sharply.</p><p>In a battle of the same level, there were very few people who could block this move of his head on, let alone those whose cultivation was lower than his. Lu Ming was only a fifth level celestial deity.</p><p>This caused Chu BA Xing to feel a deep sense of jealousy.</p><p>“Let’s see how many moves you can block. Kill!”</p><p>Chu baxing bellowed and continued to control the God of War’s attack to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>“Moon cutting combo!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He first cast the divine Dragon materialization art and condensed Nine Nine Nine-clawed divine Dragons to pounce on his opponent. Then, he continuously cast the moon cutting technique. In an instant, seven crescent-shaped spear gleams slashed at his opponent.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The nine divine Dragons collided with the God of War’s attack in a suicidal manner and exploded continuously.</p><p>Following that, seven crescent-shaped spearlights also slashed at the God of War’s strike.</p><p>The giant God of War’s body shook continuously. In the end, it couldn’t withstand the continuous attacks and exploded with a bang, turning into energy and dissipating.</p><p>Chu BA Xing’s body trembled as he retreated to the light barrier at the edge of the fighting ring, his face pale.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled. Could it be that Chu baxing was going to be defeated? defeated at the hands of a fifth level celestial deity?</p><p>it seems that your so-called God of War’s strike is nothing more than this. Chu BA Xing, you’re the one who’ll die today!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly as he stepped forward, pressing towards Chu baxing.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you think you can kill me? in your dreams! You forced me to do this. I was planning to use this move against you han. Now, you’ll have a taste of it!”</p><p>Chu baxing growled, his face twisted with malevolence.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The aura on his body rose sharply again.</p><p>He held the spear horizontally and took a step forward. His body rose into the air and began to spin rapidly.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>Chu baxing began to spin madly, and in an instant, a terrifying vortex appeared in the sky.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Chu baxing’s cold voice rang out from the vortex. Then, a terrifying suction force spread out from the vortex, trying to devour Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his divine energy and stabilized his body. However, the vortex that Chu baxing had transformed into charged straight at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn. He could sense a terrifying danger in this vortex. If he were to be swept into it, he would probably be ground into minced meat.</p><p>“Divine Dragon phenomenon!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted in a low voice and cast the divine Dragon materialization technique again. The nine divine Dragons rushed toward the vortex.</p><p>However, when the divine Dragon phenomenon collided with the vortex, it was immediately twisted into energy by the vortex.</p><p>The vortex did not stop and continued to envelop Lu Ming.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. He held the spear with both hands and slashed down with all his might. A crescent-shaped spear ray struck the vortex.</p><p>Clang clang clang …</p><p>When Lu Ming’s slash landed on the vortex, the spear in his hand was instantly bombarded thousands of times. A terrifying force was transmitted. With a bang, the ninth level high-grade divine artifact spear in Lu Ming’s hand actually shattered.</p><p>A powerful force rushed toward Lu Ming. His body trembled and he was forced to retreat to the edge of the fighting ring, where he crashed into the light shield.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
