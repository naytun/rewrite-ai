In Lu Ming’s heart, he had already sentenced this person to death. If he had the chance, he would definitely kill this person.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming looked around. Unfortunately, he did not see the young man from the winged men tribe near the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>It seemed that the other party had left long ago.</p><p>“Qiuyue, the ten years are almost up. Let’s go out!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded obediently. The two of them chose their direction and turned into two streaks of light, flying away.</p><p>There was a special passage to leave star-moon ancient city. The passage from the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion was in a huge Valley in the East of star-moon ancient city.</p><p>The other members of the Heavenly King Manor had other channels.</p><p>Every time a person entered star-moon ancient city, they would exit through a special passageway. This passageway would open once every ten years.</p><p>Now, ten years would soon be up.</p><p>The thousand Moon Lake was located on the west side of star-moon ancient city. There was still a long distance to the East. The two of them rushed at full speed, but it still took them seven days to reach the exit.</p><p>In the sky above a large Valley, a huge vortex appeared.</p><p>This was the exit. No one could explain why a tunnel like this would open up after they had entered for ten years.</p><p>Perhaps it was a formation set up by the experts who built star-moon ancient city.</p><p>Everyone could only guess.</p><p>When the two of them arrived, they found that people were flying towards them from all directions. Some people flew directly into the vortex and disappeared.</p><p>It was obvious that some people had already left.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>A few voices were heard. Lu Ming turned around and saw Wu Ming, Wu Yue, and the rest flying over.</p><p>“Brother Wu Ming, brother Wu Yue …”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and greeted him.</p><p>“Lady Qiuyue is fine, that’s great!”</p><p>Wu Ming and the rest smiled when they saw Qiu Yue.</p><p>“It’s a long story, let’s talk about it outside!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At once, everyone flew toward the vortex. After they entered the vortex, the world spun. The next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had already left star-moon ancient city and was back outside the city walls.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room and saw elder Bai Li of the star Battalion sitting cross-legged in the air.</p><p>In addition, there were many figures standing in the air. They were all the star camp’s elites from star-moon ancient city.</p><p>Lu Ming saw Xu Yan, the young man in animal hide, and Jin Yuan.</p><p>When Xu Yan, the young man in animal hide, and the rest saw Lu Ming, they nodded and smiled as a form of greeting.</p><p>As for Jin Yuan, his eyes were extremely cold, and killing intent kept flickering in them.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming felt a cold killing intent engulf him. He swept his gaze around and saw an absolute beauty staring at him coldly.</p><p>Blue Spirit!</p><p>This woman, if she wasn’t lan Ling who had been hunting him down, who else could she be?</p><p>However, LAN Ling did not make a move this time. Instead, she glared at Lu Ming coldly before casting a glance at Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Young master, who is that young lady? She seems to have a deep grudge against you. Did you let her down?”</p><p>Qiu Yue was very sensitive. She noticed LAN Ling and mumbled softly.</p><p>“Go Away, Little Girl, don’t let your imagination run wild. I, the young master, am a gentleman!”</p><p>Lu Ming immediately said righteously. He could not think of such things in vain and ruin his character.</p><p>Qiu Yue smiled and didn’t say anything.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold, and a cold killing intent emanated from his body.</p><p>He saw a young man of the winged men race with lightning flashing on his wings. He was the one who guided Lu Ming into the vortex at the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>He was also the one who wanted to deal with Qiu Yue and force her into the whirlpool.</p><p>Clearly, this person had come out earlier than Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out of Lu Ming’s body. He took a step forward and pressed toward the youth of the winged man Tribe.</p><p>“Young master, be careful!”</p><p>Qiu Yue had also noticed the young man. She knew that with Lu Ming’s temper, she would not be able to persuade him. She could only remind him worriedly and then followed closely behind him.</p><p>Wu Ming and the rest looked at each other and followed behind Lu Ming.</p><p>The people in front of Lu Ming were suppressed by Lu Ming’s aura. They retreated one after another and opened up a path.</p><p>Lu Ming rushed toward the young man of the winged man Tribe.</p><p>The young man from the winged man Tribe also saw Lu Ming and Qiu Yue. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Damn it, these two guys entered that vortex and are actually fine? What a mistake!”</p><p>The young man’s face darkened.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming was getting closer and closer to him and that his cold killing intent was enveloping him, the young man of the winged man Tribe felt a chill run down his spine. He shouted, ” “Lu Ming, what are you doing?”</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s reply was very simple. His voice was cold and piercing.</p><p>“Kill me? What do you mean? I didn’t offend you, so why do you want to kill me? You’re simply crazy and lawless!”</p><p>The young man of the winged man race shouted.</p><p>He naturally wouldn’t admit that he wanted to deal with Qiu Yue.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His aura became even more threatening. He was too lazy to waste his breath on the other party. A long spear appeared in his hand. A beam of spear radiance burst out and shot toward the young man of the winged men tribe.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The young man’s expression changed. His aura rose sharply, especially the pair of wings on his back.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>He flapped his wings and the lightning on his wings turned into two lightning sabers, slashing at Lu Ming.</p><p>The Thunder saber slashed at Lu Ming’s spear gleam and a shocking tremor erupted.</p><p>The young man of the winged man race was not weak. He was a half-step Divine King and had awakened ninety-nine percent of his divine power. He was not far from completely awakening the origin divine power factor.</p><p>However, given Lu Ming’s current ability, how could he go against him?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The Thunder Blade of the young man was shattered, but the spear light continued to attack him.</p><p>The young man of the winged man Tribe screamed in horror. He rose into the sky in an attempt to avoid Lu Ming’s spear radiance. However, he was still one step too slow. One of his legs was pierced by the spear radiance and exploded.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The young man screamed and retreated tens of thousands of meters, spitting out blood.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>that’s amazing. Lu Ming’s abilities are so shocking? ”</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Not everyone had seen Lu Ming in action. Only a portion of them had seen Lu Ming in action. Those who had not seen Lu Ming in action were shocked when they saw that Lu Ming had injured the young man of the winged man Tribe with one move.</p><p>The young man from the winged man race was called Yi Xiang. He was the sixteenth young master of the winged man race’s family. He was very talented and was a well-known figure in the universal camp. During the trip to starry moon ancient city, Yi Xiang’s abilities had undoubtedly become stronger. However, he was still not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>“You guys don’t know, right? Lu Ming defeated Jin Yuan previously!”</p><p>Someone said in a low voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
