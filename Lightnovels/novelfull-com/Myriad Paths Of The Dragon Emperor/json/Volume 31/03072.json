Miss Ling ‘er is as beautiful as a fairy. How can she not be worthy of me? it’s just … It’s just that miss Ling ‘er wants to kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming started to complain.</p><p>“To kill you?”</p><p>LAN Shang was stunned for a moment, then he smiled bitterly, ” “This girl is really rebellious.”</p><p>Then, LAN Shang frowned and pondered.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly prayed, hoping that LAN Shang would give up on the idea of marrying LAN Ling to him.</p><p>Although LAN Ling was extremely beautiful and any man who saw her would be moved, Lu Ming knew that he would not have the Fortune to have her bad temper.</p><p>After a while, LAN Shang said, ” how about this? I won’t make things difficult for you. I will let Ling ‘er stay by your side for a thousand years so that you can cultivate your feelings. If you still don’t want to marry each other after a thousand years, or if you want to marry each other, then this matter will be over!</p><p>“This, this … That’s not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face immediately turned bitter.</p><p>To let that crazy woman, LAN Ling, follow him for a thousand years? what a joke. At the thought of this, Lu Ming felt a headache.</p><p>what’s not good about it? feelings need to be cultivated. You’re afraid that Ling ‘er will do something to you again, right? don’t worry, I’ll warn her!</p><p>in addition, Ling ‘er is quite talented. If the two of you work together, you’ll have a better chance of reversing Jingyu’s verdict. That’s it!</p><p>LAN Shang waved his hand and the matter was settled.</p><p>“This, this …”</p><p>Lu Ming was completely speechless.</p><p>“Hahaha, that’s it. Lu Ming, go out and wait for me. I’ll call Ling ‘er in and give her a good scolding!”</p><p>LAN Shang laughed out loud, like an old fox.</p><p>Lu Ming felt contempt in his heart. This LAN Shang appeared to be gentle on the surface but he was actually scheming in his heart. He was bent on matchmaking him and LAN Ling.</p><p>He believed that given LAN Ling’s beauty, she would definitely develop feelings for Lu Ming if she stayed with him every day.</p><p>this old man must have taken a fancy to my talent. Sigh, I can’t help it. Who asked me to be so talented and handsome? I really can’t help it. My life is so bitter!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>If the blue merchant knew Lu Ming’s thoughts, he would probably spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the courtyard and saw LAN Ling. He said to her,”Your father is looking for you!”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>LAN Ling snorted coldly. She did not even look at Lu Ming and walked into the courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming started to wait in the garden.</p><p>Not long after, LAN Shang and LAN Ling came out together.</p><p>LAN Ling’s eyes were red. When she saw Lu Ming, she glared at him hatefully, as if she wanted to eat him up.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll get Ling ‘er to inform you after I’ve found the evidence. I’ll get Ling’ er to send you back now. Ling ‘er, send Lu Ming off!”</p><p>LAN Shang ordered.</p><p>LAN Ling gritted her teeth and walked to Lu Ming’s side unwillingly. She said coldly,”Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. It seemed that LAN Ling had really been reprimanded by LAN Shang. It seemed that she was even more resentful of him.</p><p>“Uncle LAN, goodbye!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists, then stepped into the air and headed back to his courtyard.</p><p>LAN Ling’s face was cold as she walked side by side with Lu Ming. In a short while, they were far away from LAN Shang’s residence.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you say to my father?”</p><p>Suddenly, LAN Ling spoke. Her voice was cold and she glared at Lu Ming hatefully.</p><p>“No, he didn’t say anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. He had to deny it.</p><p>“You didn’t say? Then why would my father reprimand me? you’re a man, but you actually tattle on me in front of my father. You’re really shameless!”</p><p>LAN Ling said with hatred.</p><p>“？？？”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He felt wronged. The other party wanted to kill him the moment they met. Could he not say anything?</p><p>“Hmph! Lecherous person, you already have a woman by your side and you still want me to follow you. Shameless, despicable …”</p><p>LAN Ling continued to curse.</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood.</p><p>What did he mean by letting LAN Ling follow him? it was clearly LAN Shang who forced him to do so, okay?</p><p>don’t talk nonsense. It was your father who forced you to follow me for a thousand years. I was originally unwilling to do so …</p><p>Lu Ming quickly denied it.</p><p>“So you’re saying that no one wants me, that my father forced me to give it to you, and that I’m out of your league?”</p><p>LAN Ling’s face turned even colder.</p><p>Lu Ming almost vomited blood. Why was this woman’s brain so full of holes? he did not mean that.</p><p>if you want to stay by your side for a thousand years, that’s fine too. It all depends on whether you have the ability to do so. If you can take three of my moves and not die, I’ll follow you for a thousand years!</p><p>All of a sudden, LAN Ling’s voice turned cold. A cold, murderous intent enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He could feel that LAN Ling really wanted to kill him.</p><p>He wanted to use this reason to kill him.</p><p>However, that was then and this was now.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current abilities were much stronger than when he first met the Indigo spirit.</p><p>“Come on, let me experience your brilliant moves!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>He had already been very polite, but LAN Ling was still pressing him. Lu Ming was also angry.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long sword was unsheathed, and the sound of the sword was shocking.</p><p>“The first move!”</p><p>As soon as LAN Ling’s voice rang out, a terrifying sword light slashed violently at Lu Ming. Its power was extremely shocking.</p><p>This move could even kill a half-step Divine King who had not awakened the origin divine power factor.</p><p>LAN Ling did not show any mercy.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body. A long spear appeared in his hand and he swung it.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The spear and the sword light collided with a violent boom. A terrible storm spread in all directions.</p><p>When the energy dissipated, Lu Ming and LAN Ling stood motionless in the air.</p><p>“So he has already awakened the origin divine power factor!”</p><p>LAN Ling’s eyes narrowed in surprise.</p><p>She did not expect that Lu Ming, who was only at the sixth-level heavenly God Realm, would be able to awaken the divine power factor.</p><p>Wait, sixth level celestial deity!</p><p>LAN Ling suddenly thought of something and revealed a look of shock.</p><p>She remembered very clearly that Lu Ming’s cultivation level was only at the fourth-level celestial deity realm back in Starmoon ancient city.</p><p>It had only been a short while and Lu Ming actually broke through two levels consecutively, reaching sixth level celestial deity. This speed was also a little too fast.</p><p>he must have had a fortuitous encounter in star-moon ancient city. Otherwise, it’s absolutely impossible for him to cultivate so quickly by himself!</p><p>LAN Ling’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>She was not wrong about this. Lu Ming had indeed encountered a fortuitous encounter. Otherwise, it was impossible for his cultivation to improve so quickly.</p><p>“One move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Originally, he could have lost on purpose, and LAN Ling would not have to stay by his side.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had his own pride. He wanted to teach the Indigo spirit a lesson and he would not back down.</p><p>“Hmph, don’t think that you can stop me just because you’ve awakened the origin divine power factor!”</p><p>Hmph! LAN Ling snorted coldly. Her aura grew stronger and she pushed her strength to the limit.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sword shadow that was tens of thousands of meters long trembled the void non-stop. Then, it slashed down at Lu Ming with terrifying power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
