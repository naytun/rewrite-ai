When was that?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he quickly asked.</p><p>“Who is this woman to you? Why should I tell you?”</p><p>The young man from the winged man race said.</p><p>this woman is my wife, and she entered star-moon ancient city with me. I’m sure you already know about her!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Oh, so it’s your wife. To be honest, when I first entered star-moon ancient city, I was teleported to this place. I happened to see your wife, but she entered this vortex later.</p><p>The young man from the winged man race said.</p><p>“We’ve entered the vortex?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart sank and he had more doubts.</p><p>Why did Qiu Yue enter this vortex?</p><p>But then again, it wasn’t impossible. The voice transmission jade talisman couldn’t transmit messages. It was very likely that it was isolated. If Qiu Yue was in this Whirlpool, it was very normal that the voice transmission jade talisman couldn’t transmit messages.</p><p>“Brother, did you see my wife after that?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again.</p><p>“No, to be honest, I’ve been cultivating around here for the past few years and I’ve never seen your wife again. She entered the whirlpool and never came out.”</p><p>The young man from the winged man race said.</p><p>she never came out again. Could it be that Qiu Yue has always been inside? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more worried. In the end, Lu Ming decided to go in and take a look himself.</p><p>Although he did not know if it was dangerous in the whirlpool, Lu Ming had to go on this trip.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the young man of the winged man Tribe and turned to leave. He checked the surroundings of the vortex for a moment and then rushed directly into it.</p><p>As soon as he rushed into the vortex, the endless waves around him smacked toward Lu Ming. Even a divine mountain would be crushed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming circulated his divine power and the nine-layered Crimson Gold armor appeared, easily blocking the huge wave’s attack.</p><p>Lu Ming followed the energy of the vortex and emerged from the depths of the vortex, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had entered the vortex, the young man from the winged man Tribe sneered, then revealed a ferocious killing intent.</p><p>“Lu Ming, hehehe, there’s something I forgot to tell you. I forced your wife into this Whirlpool. This Whirlpool is definitely very dangerous. I hope you die in there, hehehe!”</p><p>The young man of the winged man race sneered.</p><p>He did not leave immediately. Instead, he waited in the surroundings for a few months. When he did not see Lu Ming coming out, he left.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hear what the young man said. He followed the vortex and went down. Slowly, the vortex shrank. Finally, Lu Ming felt light. He had come out of the vortex and was in an underground space.</p><p>The walls of this underground space were carved with lifelike statues, as if they were ancient gods that had crossed time and space.</p><p>There was indeed another world under the thousand Moon Lake.</p><p>“Qiuyue should be right below here!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked around and finally found a passage. He followed the passage and walked forward.</p><p>There was nothing unusual along the way. After passing through the passage, he arrived at an even larger hall.</p><p>&Nbsp; tap tap tap …</p><p>When Lu Ming stepped into the hall, he heard the sound of footsteps.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and his eyes were fixed in one direction.</p><p>There was a huge door in that direction.</p><p>Not long after, a figure walked out from behind the door.</p><p>It was a human elder in a snow-white robe. He had a head full of white hair and a snow-white beard. He looked like a celestial being.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stared at the old man cautiously.</p><p>This old man was not like the rock spirit, which had an illusory body. He was a living being, a body of flesh and blood.</p><p>How could there be such an old man in star-moon ancient city?</p><p>Could it be that he was a native of this place, or an old monster who had survived since the beginning of the era of the heavenly Palace?</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless.</p><p>“Finally, someone else is here?”</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming and smiled. His smile was kind and made people feel like they were bathing in the spring breeze.</p><p>Anyway, Lu Ming could not sense any malicious intent from the other party.</p><p>“Senior, this junior has a friend who has entered this place. This junior is here to find someone!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“You’re looking for a beautiful lady, right?”</p><p>The old man asked with a smile.</p><p>“That’s right. Has senior seen it before?”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He quickly took out Qiu Yue’s image and showed it to the old man.</p><p>The old man took a look and nodded, ” “That’s right, this is the girl who came here a few years ago!”</p><p>“Where is this young lady now? To tell you the truth, this young lady is my wife!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Although Lu Ming and Qiu Yue were not officially married yet, Lu Ming had already regarded Qiu Yue as his wife.</p><p>“So she’s your wife!”</p><p>The old man smiled. you don’t have to worry. Your wife is safe. She even obtained a Supreme opportunity!</p><p>“Obtained a Supreme opportunity? What do you mean?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked again. He would not trust the other party easily.</p><p>at the beginning of the heavenly Palace era, this place was the abode of a Supreme expert. That Supreme expert was the master of my ancestor. Later, that Supreme expert passed away and left behind his inheritance. Your wife just so happens to fit this inheritance. She has been receiving the inheritance all these years. Isn’t this a great fortune? ”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“The inheritance of a Supreme expert?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and his mind was racing.</p><p>The old man’s words revealed a lot of information.</p><p>First of all, this place was the cave dwelling of a Supreme expert in the early days of the heavenly Palace era. That expert had fallen and left behind his inheritance.</p><p>The ancestor of this old man was the servant of that expert.</p><p>In that case, this old man was really a native of star-moon ancient city. Had he passed down his legacy to protect this place?</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming would not believe the other party just because of a few words.</p><p>“Senior, can you let me see my wife?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“She’s currently receiving the inheritance and is at a critical moment. I’m afraid it’s not convenient to meet her!” The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened. If he did not see the person, how would he know if the other party was telling the truth?</p><p>“However, if you really want to, I can let you see her!”</p><p>The old man’s tone suddenly changed as he waved his hand. His palm glowed, and an image appeared in the air.</p><p>In the picture, there was a stone room, and a beautiful woman sat cross-legged, emitting nine-colored divine light.</p><p>Who else could this woman be if not Qiu Yue?</p><p>Qiu Yue sat cross-legged with a solemn expression. A huge ball was floating above her head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
