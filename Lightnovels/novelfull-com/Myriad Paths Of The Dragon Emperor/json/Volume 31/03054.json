It strangled everything and Lu Ming could not even withstand it head-on.</p><p>Outside the fighting ring, you Han’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The power of Chu baxing’s move was indeed too shocking. Even if he cultivated a strange cultivation technique, it was still a threat to him. He might not be able to nullify the power of the attack.</p><p>“Lu Ming, go to hell. Hahaha!”</p><p>Chu baxing laughed heartily, and the vortex continued to envelop Lu Ming. Before it even reached him, the terrifying force had already pressed down on Lu Ming, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming growled. The divine fire in his body burned and the boundless divine power rushed madly towards the long spear. Lu Ming used the supernova again. A huge spear light rushed towards the vortex and exploded. The destructive power kept hitting the vortex.</p><p>Hu hu hu …</p><p>“Buzz …”</p><p>Under the impact of the destructive energy, the vortex constantly trembled and finally retreated some distance. It seemed to have slowed down a bit, but in just a few breaths, the vortex continued to speed up and make whistling sounds.</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes. The star Blast could block the attack of the God of War but it could not block this move. One could imagine how powerful this move was.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not plan to cast the ice chain to protect himself.</p><p>Lu Ming planned to use the ice chain to deal with you han.</p><p>After the battle with you Lian, Lu Ming realized that the ice chain was very useful and could restrain the other party. Lu Ming did not want to expose himself now.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Chu baxing shouted again, and the vortex charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted in a low voice again and cast the star explosion. The destructive energy sent the vortex flying again.</p><p>“It seems that you can’t kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Hmph, I don’t believe that you can keep using this move!”</p><p>Chu baxing shouted coldly. Lu Ming’s move was extremely powerful. He definitely could not keep using it. Just like his current move, not only did it consume a lot of divine power, but it also exhausted his body. He did not want to use it unless he had no other choice.</p><p>Today, he had been forced by Lu Ming to use it.</p><p>“You don’t believe me? Then I’ll have to disappoint you, supernova!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled disdainfully. As soon as he finished speaking, he cast another star burst.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The destructive energy struck the vortex once again, and the vortex was sent flying.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming discovered that after a few consecutive attacks, the spinning speed of the vortex was continuously decreasing. It was obvious that Chu baxing was not completely unscathed from Lu Ming’s continuous attacks. He was running out of energy.</p><p>Since it’s useful, let’s try again!</p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the ” measure ” formula glowed and a steady stream of divine power surged into Lu Ming’s body. In a few breaths, the divine power in Lu Ming’s body was full again.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming launched another move.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The vortex was sent flying again, and its speed became even slower. It was obvious that even its power had decreased.</p><p>“Dammit, dammit, why can’t his divine power be used up!?”</p><p>At this moment, Chu baxing was roaring in his heart. He was truly terrified.</p><p>If this continued, he wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer. Once he couldn’t hold on, the consequences would be very serious.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s divine power was full and he fired another shot.</p><p>This time, the vortex that Chu baxing had transformed into was sent flying. It crashed into the light barrier at the edge of the fighting ring, almost stopping its rotation.</p><p>“Abnormal!”</p><p>Xu Yan, the young man in animal hide, and the others muttered.</p><p>This sentence was, of course, used to describe Lu Ming. In their hearts, Lu Ming was indeed a pervert.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Chu baxing’s angry roar came from the vortex. He tried his best to control the vortex and increase its speed.</p><p>However, he had used up a lot of his divine power, and the side effects of using this move were already showing. Cracks were appearing on his body.</p><p>If it was possible, he wanted to stop the war.</p><p>However, this was a life-and-death battle. He had no choice but to brace himself. Now, he could only pray that Lu Ming’s divine power would be exhausted and he would be at his mercy.</p><p>Therefore, he had to persevere.</p><p>However, he immediately fell into despair.</p><p>“Star explosion!”</p><p>This voice that made him feel despair came out of Lu Ming’s mouth again. Then, a terrifying spear ray came at him again.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, Chu baxing was once again sent flying, heavily crashing into the light barrier at the edge of the stage. This time, Chu baxing could no longer hold on, and the vortex collapsed, revealing his body.</p><p>Chu baxing’s body was extremely terrifying. His skin was covered in bloody scars, as if his body was about to split apart.</p><p>His aura was extremely dispirited. Compared to his previous violent attitude, it was a hundred and eight thousand miles away.</p><p>Not only did he suffer a backlash, but he was also severely injured by Lu Ming. He had no more strength to fight.</p><p>Chu BA Xing, it seems like you’ll be the one to die!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and stepped forward.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t kill me!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing’s eyes revealed a trace of fear as he roared.</p><p>“I can’t kill you? Don’t use your status to threaten me again, I don’t buy it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Chu baxing gritted his teeth. He had indeed wanted to use his identity to threaten Lu Ming so that he would let him go.</p><p>However, was there any other path for him now?</p><p>“Lu Ming, my status is different. I am from the war god lineage. My ancestor is the war god of the great void Holy dynasty. If you kill me, you will not be able to survive no matter where you go!”</p><p>In the end, Chu baxing brought out the power behind him to threaten him. He believed that the power behind him was different from others.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were all the same in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>the bloodline of the God of War has already declined and is now under the control of the nine blades Heavenly King mansion. You still have the nerve to threaten me with it? what a joke!</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>“I won’t allow you to insult my war god clan. My war god clan will definitely rise. Among the younger generation, my war god clan has produced a rare heaven’s favorite. He will definitely lead the war god clan back to glory!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, I see that you’re a talent. Why don’t you join the line of the God of War as soon as possible? I’ll guarantee your meteoric rise in the future!”</p><p>Chu BA Xing roared.</p><p>“You’re so naive!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He could not be bothered to waste his breath on Chu baxing. With a shake of his long spear, he stabbed out more than ten times in an instant. More than ten spearlights were aimed at Chu baxing.</p><p>Chu baxing roared and tried his best to resist. However, in his current state, he could not exert much of his strength. The difference between him and Lu Ming was too great.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>His body was continuously pierced by the spear radiance.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the clansmen of the God of War will avenge me!”</p><p>die! Chu baxing roared in anger. Then, his forehead was pierced through by the spear, and his soul was destroyed.</p><p>Chu baxing, the outstanding successor of the God of War’s lineage, had died at Lu Ming’s hands in the end.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Lu Ming kept Chu baxing’s storage ring.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
