Then, a powerful aura surged towards the experts of the woo family.</p><p>“All of you, get out of my way and I’ll spare your lives!”</p><p>The clan head of the winged world clan shouted coldly.</p><p>“Yi family head, young master Lu Ming, the Wu family will protect you!”</p><p>.com</p><p>A burly man from the Wu family gritted his teeth. Even though they had no chance of winning against the head of the winged man clan, they had to do what the head had told them.</p><p>Even if he had to pay with his life!</p><p>“Since you want to protect him, I can only send you all to hell!”</p><p>The winged man clan’s clan head’s voice was incomparably cold, and it exuded a chilling killing intent.</p><p>“Yi Kuang, you talk big. Let’s see how you’re going to kill him!” At this moment, a cold voice was heard from behind Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, another person appeared behind Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and saw a burly man in a brocade robe. He looked somewhat similar to Wu Zifeng, but he was more dignified.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>The woo family members were overjoyed to see the burly man in embroidered clothes and quickly bowed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. So this person was the Wu family’s family head, an existence that was on par with the winged man family’s family head. He was one of the overlords of the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion.</p><p>“Lu Ming of the junior generation greets family head Wu!”</p><p>Lu Ming also cupped his fists and bowed.</p><p>“Haha, no need to be so polite!”</p><p>The Wu family’s master smiled and waved his sleeve. A wave of energy gushed out and lifted Lu Ming up.</p><p>“Wu Yi!”</p><p>The winged man clan’s clan head looked at the Wu clan’s clan head and muttered in a low voice, his eyes turning cold.</p><p>“Yi Kuang, you’re the head of the Wu family. Are you bullying my Wu family because we have no one? Come, come, come. If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch was extremely overbearing. He took a step forward and appeared in front of Lu Ming and the others, standing opposite the winged man clan’s patriarch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A shocking aura exploded from the two of them. As their auras clashed, the entire sky within a radius of a million miles trembled violently as if it was going to collapse.</p><p>In the middle of the clash of their auras, the void twisted and the energy whistled as if it was about to turn into chaos.</p><p>The surrounding people retreated again and again, their faces full of fear.</p><p>“How terrifying! Is this the strength of a head of a clan? It’s too shocking!”</p><p>I’ve heard that the patriarchs of the aristocratic families have reached the peak of the God King realm. They look down on the other God kings and possess world-shaking strength. Now that I’ve seen them, I can see that they truly live up to their reputation!</p><p>Some of the more powerful godkings murmured in shock.</p><p>Peak stage of the God King realm. This was the cultivation level of the winged people’s family and the Wu family’s family heads. They looked down on all the God kings and were extremely powerful.</p><p>This kind of cultivation was extremely rare in the entire nine absolute Heavenly King mansion. He was an Overlord.</p><p>In the nine absolute Heavenly King mansion, although there were existences that had transcended Godking, they were extremely rare and rarely took action.</p><p>&Nbsp; thus, if that sort of existence didn’t make a move, then a peak God King would be a peak expert.</p><p>Now, was such a character going to make a move?</p><p>Their auras became stronger and stronger as they fought in the air. There were loud Explosions in the Sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, a similarly terrifying aura came from another direction. This aura mixed with the aura of the winged man’s patriarch and pressed down on the Wu family’s patriarch.</p><p>A terrifying explosion was heard. The Wu family’s head’s expression changed and his body trembled slightly. He could not help but take a few steps back.</p><p>In the distance, a ray of golden light rapidly approached. With a few flashes, it appeared at the side of the winged man clan’s clan head. This person’s entire body was covered in golden light, and his aura was terrifying. He was not the slightest bit inferior to the winged man clan’s clan head and the Wu clan’s clan head.</p><p>“Greetings, patriarch!”</p><p>The experts of the Jin family immediately saluted.</p><p>The crowd was shocked again. Another head of an aristocratic family had arrived.</p><p>Today, there was really a show to watch.</p><p>When the Jin family head arrived, he swept his gaze across the room and it landed on Lu Ming. His eyes were filled with a shocking murderous intent.</p><p>He had already received the news that Jin Yuan had been killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Among the Jin family’s younger generation, two of the four most talented people had been killed by Lu Ming. He was furious.</p><p>Wu Yi, this brat has killed many of our Jin clan’s heaven’s pride experts, and he has also killed brother Yi’s son. He has committed a heinous crime, and he must be executed!</p><p>The head of the Jin family said coldly. His voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“What if I say no?”</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch said coldly.</p><p>“You said no? I’m afraid that you can’t protect him alone!”</p><p>The head of the Jin family said. His whole body was like a golden sun, and his terrifying aura made it hard for everyone to breathe.</p><p>that’s right. If you insist on protecting him, we can only kill you first. I believe that the Heavenly King will not blame us!</p><p>At this moment, another voice rang out. This voice didn’t come from the clan head of the winged world clan or the Jin clan, but from another person.</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a figure suddenly appeared on the other side.</p><p>This was also a middle-aged man. He was very handsome, and there was a scale between his eyebrows, which made him look quite evil.</p><p>“Greetings, patriarch!”</p><p>The people from the Qin family immediately saluted.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled once again.</p><p>&Nbsp; the Qin family head also came. Another peak God King had arrived.</p><p>Normally, it was rare to see such a person. Many people could not even greet him even if they wanted to. He did not expect that four of them would come today.</p><p>“Haha, Brother Qin, you’re here too!”</p><p>The clan head of the winged man clan smiled, then turned to the Wu clan’s clan head, and said,”Wu Yi, let’s see how you’re going to protect me now.”</p><p>The Wu family’s head frowned and his expression turned ugly.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the patriarchs of the three great families would all come.</p><p>He was not afraid of being alone.</p><p>However, if two of them attacked at the same time, he would definitely not be a match for them. If three of them attacked at the same time, he would definitely die.</p><p>At this moment, even if he wanted to protect her, he had the heart but was powerless.</p><p>I didn’t expect that the three patriarchs of the great families would make a move for a junior. What a joke!</p><p>The Wu clan’s patriarch sneered.</p><p>The three patriarchs ‘faces were also somewhat unsightly. With their appearance today, the three great patriarchs were sure to lose face.</p><p>Since he had already embarrassed himself, he would definitely not let Lu Ming off.</p><p>Wu Yi, I’ll give you one more chance. Hand over the kid, or I’ll kill you too!</p><p>The winged man clan’s clan head shouted coldly. His aura became even more oppressive, and his entire body was suffused with lightning, making him look like a Thunder God.</p><p>The Wu family’s head frowned. The current situation really made it difficult for him to back down.</p><p>hahaha, I, Lu Ming, am truly honored to have troubled three peak divine kings to take action personally. Even if I die, it’ll be worth it!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming laughed out loud and stepped forward to stand beside the Wu family head.</p><p>“Wu family head, many thanks for your good intentions, but let this junior settle today’s matter by himself!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said to the Wu family master.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
