This made him a little anxious.</p><p>this guy kept saying that he wanted to kill me, but he didn’t dare to show up. He’s also a good-for-nothing!</p><p>Hmph, but this good-for-nothing woman is really beautiful. If there’s a chance, I’ll definitely get her and play with her!</p><p>Yi Xiang’s mind was filled with malicious thoughts. When he thought of Qiu Yue’s unparalleled beauty and perfect expression, his eyes burned with a raging fire.</p><p>Compared to Qiu Yue, he suddenly felt that the beauty in his arms was simply ordinary. There was no way to compare at all. One was in the sky, and the other was on the ground.</p><p>&Nbsp; tap tap tap …</p><p>At this moment, the sound of unhurried footsteps could be heard from the stairs and spread throughout the entire third floor.</p><p>Many people looked at the stairs curiously.</p><p>This was the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. Even the weakest person would be at the void God Realm. How could there be any sound of footsteps when people who had reached this realm walked?</p><p>But now, someone was walking in such a rhythmic manner. It was obvious that this was done on purpose, so it naturally attracted the attention of others.</p><p>Soon, a young man appeared from the stairs and slowly walked up to the third floor.</p><p>“Lu … Ming!”</p><p>Yi Xiang’s eyes lit up when he saw the young man and he slowly uttered two words.</p><p>That’s right. The young man who walked up the stairs was Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked up to the third floor, step by step. His gaze was immediately locked on Yi Xiang. He then stepped forward, his cold killing intent was unconcealed as it spread out and pressed towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>“Yi Xiang, you’re finally not hiding in the winged people’s family. Very good, today will be the day of your death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly, his voice icy.</p><p>In the restaurant, many people’s hearts trembled, and they began to discuss.</p><p>“Who is this kid? And you want to kill Yi Xiang?”</p><p>Yi Xiang is the young master of the winged people’s family. This person is really audacious and doesn’t want to live anymore!</p><p>Yi Xiang’s cultivation base is also extremely shocking. This kid doesn’t seem to have a high cultivation base. He’s overestimating himself if he wants to kill Yi Xiang!</p><p>“Let’s wait and see, there’s going to be a show!”</p><p>The restaurant was abuzz with discussion, and they had an appearance of watching a show and not minding the matter.</p><p>“How dare you, kid? what did you say?”</p><p>Before Yi Xiang could say anything, a young man in his thirties slammed the table and stood up. A violent aura rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Half-step Divine King realm!</p><p>The young man who looked to be in his thirties was a half-step Divine King.</p><p>this kid wants to kill young master Yi Xiang. It seems like he’s tired of living!</p><p>On the side, another young man coldly spoke. He looked to be in his thirties.</p><p>However, these young men had long exceeded their age limit and had not joined the universal camp. Naturally, they did not know about Lu Ming’s battle results. Otherwise, they would not have dared to say such words.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you want to kill me?”</p><p>Yi Xiang said indifferently as he continued to drink, his expression calm.</p><p>He had been waiting for Lu Ming to come. Naturally, he was not flustered at all.</p><p>nonsense. How dare you touch my woman? your fate is already decided!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. After he finished speaking, he stepped forward, his killing intent growing stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, a young man appeared in front of Lu Ming. His violent aura kept pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m talking to you, didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>The young man said savagely.</p><p>“If you don’t want to die, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>die! the young man shouted coldly. He bent his fingers into a claw and clawed at Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>The young man’s claws turned golden the moment he reached out. His claws pierced through the air, making a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p>“The Jin family, hehe, it seems that they really set up a trap to lure me out!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart and then threw a punch.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s fist. Then, a nine-clawed Divine Dragon pounced out and collided with the young man’s claws.</p><p>In the next moment, the young man let out a shrill scream because his claw had exploded.</p><p>Then, the nine-clawed Divine Dragon did not stop and pounced toward the young man. It tore at the young man’s body with its claws and tore him apart.</p><p>The young man of the Jin family had fallen!</p><p>There was a slight silence in the restaurant, and many people revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful that he could kill a half-step Divine King with a lift of his hand.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you kill him? you’re looking for death! Attack! Kill him together!”</p><p>Yi Xiang roared.</p><p>Of course, he was pretending to be angry. Lu Ming killing people was to his liking.</p><p>The few people around him were originally sent to die.</p><p>If Lu Ming killed someone, they would have a hundred reasons to kill him and the universal camp would have nothing to say.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill this brat!”</p><p>Another three young men beside Yi Xiang bellowed in rage. Their violent auras burst forth and they charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The three of them had no idea what Yi Xiang and the others were up to. When they saw that Lu Ming had dared to kill their men, they were instantly enraged and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re really looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently. A long spear appeared in his hand. With a shake of the long spear, rays of spear radiance burst out.</p><p>Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!</p><p>The three spearlights easily destroyed the opponent’s attack and pierced through the area between his brows.</p><p>The three young experts were killed in an instant.</p><p>“Yi Xiang, it’s your turn now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze was fixed on Yi Xiang. He shook his long spear and another spear ray was thrust at Yi Xiang.</p><p>At this moment, there was only a young man left beside Yi Xiang.</p><p>This young man looked to be in his thirties and had a pair of wings on his back. Like Yi Xiang, he was also a lightning winged person.</p><p>At this moment, the young man moved. His body flashed and he appeared in front of Yi Xiang. One of his wings swept out like a blade.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The wings slashed at Lu Ming’s spear ray and it was immediately destroyed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a violent aura emanated from this person’s body, and the restaurant was immediately enveloped by a terrifying pressure.</p><p>“It’s the Godking!”</p><p>“He’s still at the second level of the Godking realm!”</p><p>Some people cried out in alarm.</p><p>The winged man youth was at the second tier of the Godking realm.</p><p>“As expected, there’s an expert by his side!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He knew that it wouldn’t be so easy to kill Yi Xiang this time. As expected, the other side had arranged experts.</p><p>Lu Ming, how dare you kill someone in broad daylight? this time, even the universal camp can’t save you!</p><p>Yi Xiang finally stood up, pointed at Lu Ming and shouted.</p><p>that’s right. You have committed a crime for no reason and even killed my Jin family’s people. You deserve to die ten thousand times!</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from upstairs.</p><p>The tower in the clouds had a total of five floors, and the voice came from the fourth floor.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, his body flashed and a group of people appeared beside Yi Xiang.</p><p>The one in the lead wore a golden robe and had a handsome and cold face. He was one of the four heroes of the Jin clan, Jin Yuan.</p><p>Beside Jin Yuan, there were a few middle-aged men with strong auras.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
