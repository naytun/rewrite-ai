This is a great opportunity for this girl!</p><p>The rock Spirit’s voice sounded.</p><p>“A great opportunity?”</p><p>Lu Ming was puzzled but he stopped moving.</p><p>that’s right. This stone eyeball can be said to be formed from one of the divine eye Lord’s eyes. It contains all of the divine eye Lord’s inheritance. Now that the divine eye Lord’s soul has been completely destroyed, this stone eyeball will be absorbed by this girl. This girl will obtain the divine eye Lord’s inheritance!</p><p>this is the divine eye heavenly Lord’s inheritance. This girl has a nine-orifice Saint heart. Her future is limitless. She’ll be master’s right-hand man!</p><p>The rock spirit explained.</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The soul of the divine eye heavenly Lord had already been absorbed by the purple copper coffin. Now, the stone eyeball was like a treasure that could be absorbed and refined.</p><p>Qiu Yue wanted to refine this stone eyeball and obtain its inheritance.</p><p>by the way, who is the divine eye heavenly Lord? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“His background is shocking. How many people in the primal universe dare to call themselves heavenly Lords? Each one of them is an Overlord-like existence in the world!”</p><p>The rock spirit said.</p><p>“After all that, you didn’t say anything about the other party’s background?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“The heavenly Palace, do you know about it?”</p><p>The rock spirit asked.</p><p>“The heavenly Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows twitched and a look of shock flashed across his eyes. could it be that the other party is from the heavenly Palace? ”</p><p>that’s right. Only the heavenly Palace has the title of a Lord of heaven. Every Lord of heaven is a Big Shot in the heavenly Palace!</p><p>The rock spirit explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The primal universe was divided into the incipient God Realm era and the heaven Palace era.</p><p>The reason why it was divided into the era of the heavenly Palace was because of the heavenly Palace.</p><p>After the incipient God Realm, the heaven Palace had become the real Overlord of the primal universe. They ruled everything and were Supreme.</p><p>The divine eye heavenly Lord was actually a giant from the heavenly Palace. His background was truly shocking.</p><p>However, it was said that there was more than one heavenly Palace in the primeval universe. Lu Ming was not too sure about the details. After all, Lu Ming was too far away from such a force.</p><p>Even the great void Holy dynasty was like an ant in front of the heavenly Palace.</p><p>However, at the thought that Qiu Yue could obtain the inheritance of a Lord of heaven, Lu Ming could not help but reveal a look of joy.</p><p>The inheritance of a heavenly Lord was extraordinary.</p><p>At this moment, the stone eyeball became smaller and smaller. Then, it turned into a ray of light and rushed into Qiu Yue’s body before disappearing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The next moment, a shocking aura burst out from Qiu Yue’s body.</p><p>An earth-shaking aura filled the stone room, incomparably violent.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s body trembled and her face turned pale. A stream of blood flowed out of the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>oh no, there’s still some energy left in the divine eye Lord’s eyeball. There’s too much energy. Even with the nine-orifice Saint heart, this girl can’t absorb so much at once. Her body is going to explode from the energy!</p><p>The rock spirit hurriedly called out.</p><p>“Is there any way?”</p><p>Lu Ming was extremely anxious. At that moment, Qiu Yue coughed out another mouthful of blood and her body actually swelled up.</p><p>“Kid, quick, this is ownerless energy. I can absorb it. I’ll transfer a portion of it to you, and you’ll be fine as long as you help her share some of it.”</p><p>The quantity formula shouted.</p><p>“Yes, yes yes …”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded his head repeatedly. He was really confused because he was concerned. Lu Ming did not even think of such a simple method.</p><p>Lu Ming strode forward and came to Qiu Yue’s side. The space between his brows glowed and the ” measure ” symbol flew out. A devouring force enveloped Qiu Yue’s body. Instantly, the energy in Qiu Yue’s body was continuously absorbed by the ” measure ” symbol.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s body began to shrink. Soon, she returned to her original size and her aura began to stabilize.</p><p>The nine-orifice Saint heart in her chest was shining and beating like a big drum. Endless energy poured into the nine-orifice Saint heart.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming could vaguely see a stone eyeball flying into Qiu Yue’s nine-orifice Saint heart and fusing with it.</p><p>At this moment, the quantity formula flew back to Lu Ming’s sea of consciousness.</p><p>kid, this is the remaining energy of the divine eye heavenly Lord. I’ll refine it a little and transfer it to you. You can absorb it and improve your cultivation!</p><p>The quantity formula said.</p><p>“Qiuyue, are you alright?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>she’s fine now. Don’t worry. Most of the energy has been integrated into her nine-orifice Saint heart. Her cultivation will improve by leaps and bounds!</p><p>The rock spirit explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was relieved. He removed his ancient God Body and returned to his original form. He sat cross-legged at the side.</p><p>Indeed, not long after, waves of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body from the ” quantity ” formula.</p><p>This energy was extremely shocking and very easy to absorb. Lu Ming circulated the universe thousand Dao Scripture and began to absorb this energy. He transformed it into different types of divine power and strengthened the divine fire.</p><p>The nine divine flames in his dantian were growing stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation was also rising rapidly, approaching peak fifth level celestial deity continuously.</p><p>After a few days, all of Lu Ming’s divine energy cultivation had reached peak fifth-level celestial deity. Then, he started to charge towards sixth-level celestial deity.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was constantly emitting a rumbling sound.</p><p>Another seven days passed.</p><p>The energy that the quantity formula had absorbed had been transferred to Lu Ming.</p><p>There was a violent explosion in Lu Ming’s body, and a powerful aura rushed out of Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Sixth level celestial deity!</p><p>Lu Ming absorbed the energy that the ” measure ” formula transferred to him and his cultivation broke through in one go, reaching the sixth level celestial deity realm.</p><p>One should know that Lu Ming controlled so many types of divine powers. He needed a lot of energy to increase his cultivation level. This time, he had broken through a realm. If it were someone else, it would be enough to break through two realms.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up, his eyes glimmering.</p><p>His cultivation had broken through, and his battle prowess had become even stronger. If he were to face you han now, a heaven’s favorite like Chu baxing would definitely be crushed.</p><p>Lu Ming thought about it and then shifted his gaze to Qiu Yue.</p><p>At one glance, Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>This was because Qiu Yue’s aura was also shockingly powerful.</p><p>Seventh level celestial deity!</p><p>Qiu Yue’s cultivation actually reached seventh level celestial deity.</p><p>One had to know that when she entered Starmoon ancient city, Qiu Yue’s cultivation was only at the second level of the celestial deity realm.</p><p>Moreover, Qiu Yue had also cultivated the universe thousand Dao Scripture and controlled many types of divine powers. The energy she needed to increase her cultivation level was not less than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>But, so quickly, Qiu Yue broke through to the seventh level celestial deity. This improvement speed was seriously shocking.</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was deep in thought, another shocking aura burst out from Qiu Yue’s body. Her divine power was boiling like a tide, and a powerful force spread in all directions.</p><p>Eighth level celestial deity!</p><p>Lu Ming was tongue-tied and he looked stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
