This shocked everyone and they were dumbfounded.</p><p>Oh my God, is this for real? Lu Ming defeated Jin Yuan? ”</p><p>“If I remember correctly, Lu Ming was only a fourth-level celestial deity when he entered star-moon ancient city. Could he defeat Jin Yuan?”</p><p>“This is too terrifying!”</p><p>After hearing this, many people were in disbelief. There was a lot of discussion at the scene.</p><p>Of course, most of them did not know that Lu Ming had not only defeated Jin Yuan but also a few other unparalleled geniuses from the Heavenly King residence in the process of fighting for the life soul vitality stone.</p><p>Only Jin Yuan, Xu Yan, and the young man in animal hide knew about this, and they didn’t spread the news. If the others knew about this, their jaws would probably drop.</p><p>Jin Yuan’s face darkened when he heard this.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming ignored the discussions around him. He only wanted to kill Yi Xiang now.</p><p>“Men, men, kill this brat for me!”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming continued to charge at him, Yi Xiang shouted in fear.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful.</p><p>“Don’t even think about hurting the young master!”</p><p>From the side, loud roars could be heard as bolts of lightning flickered. In the next moment, a dozen figures appeared in front of Yi Xiang.</p><p>These figures were all geniuses of the lightning winged human race.</p><p>Yi Xiang was the 16th young master of the lightning winged race. Normally, the prodigies of the winged race had to listen to Yi Xiang’s orders.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death by attacking young master Yi Xiang!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, surrender and follow us back to the winged ones ‘family to accept our punishment!”</p><p>The geniuses of the winged men tribe shouted one after another, using the winged men tribe to suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>However, it was obvious that they had miscalculated. Why would Lu Ming care about the winged ones ‘family?</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Brat, you’re very arrogant. Even if you’re powerful, can’t we do anything to you with so many people?”</p><p>“Let’s attack together and capture this brat!”</p><p>The winged men elites roared and released their powerful auras.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>They released their auras and Thunder rumbled. More than ten geniuses of the winged men tribe attacked at the same time. They flapped their wings and bolts of lightning were shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The power of lightning was already extremely powerful. With so many heaven’s favorites working together, the power was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl and activated the quadruple combat power of the battle formula. He swept his spear horizontally.</p><p>A huge spear radiance formed. It was as huge as a mountain and pressed down on the winged man race’s prodigy.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Bolts of lightning collided with Lu Ming’s spear gleam, creating a violent boom.</p><p>Then, the lightning collapsed one after another, and the spear radiance continued to sweep out.</p><p>The winged men’s expressions changed drastically as they yelled, ” “Block it, quickly block it!”</p><p>They gave it their all and launched their strongest attack in an attempt to block Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>However, when the Spear’s gleam swept past, these geniuses of the winged men tribe were blasted away by Lu Ming like cannonballs. They flew tens of thousands of meters away before coming to a stop. Then, they spat out mouthfuls of blood and were severely injured.</p><p>After activating the battle formula, Lu Ming’s combat power was quadrupled. He severely injured more than ten winged men’s prodigies in one move.</p><p>His cold gaze once again turned towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>Yi Xiang’s face was deathly pale, without a trace of blood.</p><p>He desperately flew towards Bai Li and shouted, ” “Elder Bai, save me! Save me! This Lu Ming has gone mad!”</p><p>He could only pin his hopes on Bai Li now. At the scene, only Bai Li could save him.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted as he thrust his spear forward. A terrifying spear ray that was incomparably sharp pierced towards Yi Xiang.</p><p>It was fast, shockingly fast.</p><p>Yi Xiang wanted to Dodge, but he found that his body seemed to be locked on, and he couldn’t Dodge at all.</p><p>He had a feeling that if he was hit by this move, he would die.</p><p>“No, no, no, help!”</p><p>Yi Xiang screamed madly, he was so scared that he almost peed his pants. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Just as the spear light was about to hit Yi Xiang, a light screen suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear ray hit the light screen, causing it to shake slightly. Then, the spear ray disappeared.</p><p>The spear light was blocked.</p><p>“Well … We’re saved!”</p><p>Yi Xiang stammered. He was covered in cold sweat and his body was trembling non-stop. Just now, he was almost scared to death.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened as he glanced at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, Bai Li sat cross-legged.</p><p>At the scene, only Bai Li was able to save Yi Xiang. Very clearly, that light screen earlier was released by Yi Xiang.</p><p>“Elder Bai, this man tried to kill my wife in star-moon ancient city. If my wife wasn’t so lucky, she would have been dead by now. I want to kill him. Why did you stop me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was neither haughty nor humble as it spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Many people came to a sudden realization and looked at Qiu Yue who was beside Lu Ming.</p><p>It turned out that Yi Xiang wanted to harm Qiu Yue in secret. No wonder Lu Ming wanted to kill Yi Xiang as soon as he saw him.</p><p>if you have any grudges, you can settle them in star-moon ancient city. Or, when we return to the universal camp, I won’t care how you want to kill them. However, since you’ve left star-moon ancient city alive, I have the obligation to bring you back to the universal camp safely one by one!</p><p>Bai Li said.</p><p>“Elder Bai, are you really going to interfere?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. Whatever grudges you have, you can settle them when we get back to the universal camp. I won’t care about it then!</p><p>Bai Li said, his voice cutting through metal and iron, leaving no room for compromise.</p><p>Actually, Bai Li had no other choice.</p><p>The lightning-winged human clan had a huge influence in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor. Not only in the nine absolute Heavenly King Manor, but also in the great void Holy dynasty.</p><p>Right now, everyone was watching. If he just watched Yi Xiang being killed by Lu Ming and did nothing, he would not be able to shirk responsibility if the winged men clan came to find trouble with him later.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he did not have any background. Naturally, he had to protect Yi Xiang.</p><p>“Since elder Bai has said so, I won’t make a move!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he turned to leave.</p><p>Bai Li’s cultivation was unfathomable. Lu Ming was not able to fight against him. Bai Li was determined to interfere. No matter what, he would not be able to kill Yi Xiang.</p><p>If he insisted on taking action, not only would he not be able to kill Yi Xiang, but he would also offend Bai Li. After weighing the pros and cons, Lu Ming could only give up for the time being and find another opportunity to kill Yi Xiang in the future.</p><p>There would be plenty of opportunities in the future!</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, I’ll make sure you die a horrible death!”</p><p>Yi Xiang stared at Lu Ming and roared in his heart.</p><p>The scene quieted down once again. Everyone waited quietly for the others to come out of star-moon ancient city.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another ten days passed.</p><p>“Alright, the ten-year time limit is up. The passageway in star-moon ancient city has been closed. Those who have not come out will not be able to come out. Let’s go back!”</p><p>Bai Li’s voice resounded throughout the entire area. Then, he led everyone in the direction of the wormhole.</p><p>On the way, Yi Xiang only followed Bai Li, afraid that Lu Ming would attack him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
