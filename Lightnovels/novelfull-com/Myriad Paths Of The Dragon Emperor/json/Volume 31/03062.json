Next, Lu Ming focused more on his comprehension.</p><p>Days and months passed.</p><p>Time flew by, and four years had passed.</p><p>At this moment, the ten-year period since Lu Ming and the rest entered star-moon ancient city was almost up.</p><p>All these years, Lu Ming had been sitting cross-legged under the stone tablet, not moving at all.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming, who had his eyes closed, suddenly opened them.</p><p>His eyeballs could not be seen at all, only two colors.</p><p>On the left, it was dark, like an abyss.</p><p>On the right, it was snow-white and emitted holy light.</p><p>The next moment, runes flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes continuously. They were densely packed and only disappeared after a long while. Lu Ming’s eyes had also returned to normal.</p><p>“After almost four years, I’ve finally entered the rudiments!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled in a low voice.</p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the Yin Yang divine eyes secret technique was beyond Lu Ming’s imagination.</p><p>Given Lu Ming’s talent, regardless of whether it was cultivating other secret skills or divine skills, his speed was astonishingly fast, far faster than ordinary people. However, he had spent almost four years just at the beginner level of cultivating this secret skill.</p><p>I should be able to leave this formation now that I’ve cultivated it to the beginner level!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered, his eyes filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>Another four years had passed, and he hoped that Qiu Yue could hold on.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up slowly and walked out of the array.</p><p>“Oh, there’s finally some movement after four years? Are you going to kneel down and beg for mercy?”</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming get up, Deng Xiu sneered and mocked.</p><p>“This time, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“What? Kill me? Hahaha, you’ve been sitting here for four years. Have you become stupid? will you be able to come out if you kill me? You can say such things when you’re out, hahaha …”</p><p>Deng Xiu burst out laughing. His laughter was filled with ridicule, but it grew softer and softer. In the end, his laughter was stuck in his throat and he could no longer laugh.</p><p>His huge eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>This was because Lu Ming’s eyes had undergone a major change. Countless runes appeared in his eyes and interwove into a strange pattern.</p><p>Then, runes appeared in the air in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>These runes were like threads, intertwining and revolving around each other before flying towards the light screen formed by the formation.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>These runes collided with the light curtain of the formation, making a sizzling sound. Then, the light curtain was cut open and formed a door.</p><p>The formation had been broken.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his figure was out of the large array.</p><p>At this moment, Deng Xiu stared at Lu Ming as if he had seen a ghost. He roared in disbelief, the yin-yang divine eyes! How did you manage to cultivate the yin-yang divine eyes? this is impossible! This is impossible …</p><p>Deng Xiu screamed like a mad man. This was completely beyond his understanding.</p><p>“Nothing is impossible for me!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Deng Xiu was shocked and quickly retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming was about to give chase when he suddenly staggered and almost fell.</p><p>At the same time, a sharp pain came from his eyes, and two streams of blood flowed out.</p><p>I didn’t expect that using the yin-yang divine eyes would place such a huge burden on my body and eyes!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly in his heart.</p><p>When he used the yin-yang divine eyes to break the formation, the divine power in Lu Ming’s body was emptied in an instant. He felt weak and his eyes were severely injured.</p><p>Although the yin-yang divine eyes were powerful, the requirements to use them were also very high.</p><p>the yin-yang divine eyes are divided into the yin eyes and the Yang eyes. It might be better if I use them separately, but it’s too much of a burden to use them together. I’ll have to be more careful in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>“Men, men, kill this brat for me!”</p><p>At this moment, Deng Xiu finally reacted and roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as Deng Xiu’s voice fell, figures rushed out from all directions.</p><p>These figures all had huge eyes that were exactly the same as Deng xiupei’s. It was extremely disgusting.</p><p>It was apparent that these were the same as Deng Xiu, formed from his master’s minced meat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill this brat!”</p><p>The eyeballs roared and shot out beams of divine light at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ice chains!”</p><p>At that moment, the divine energy in the ” quantity ” formula gushed out continuously. Lu Ming’s body was filled with divine energy again.</p><p>Then, nine ice chains flew out and blocked in front of Lu Ming. The divine light struck the ice chains, but they were all blocked.</p><p>“Its power is only so-so, then … Go to hell!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard.</p><p>In the first exchange, Lu Ming discovered that the power of these eyeballs was only average. The strongest was only at the half-step Divine King realm.</p><p>Lu Ming activated his ancient God Body and turned into a green-armored ancient God. He shook his long spear, and rays of spear light burst out, aiming at the eyeballs.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>These eyeballs were pierced by the spear radiance and exploded, blood and flesh splattering everywhere.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of eyeballs were killed.</p><p>“Moon slaying!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming cast the moon Slayer. A crescent-shaped spear ray slashed out and a large number of eyeballs were killed.</p><p>no wonder he didn’t dare to attack me directly and trapped me with a formation. His strength is really ordinary!</p><p>Lu Ming had an idea. He held the long spear and charged into the group of eyeballs, killing them.</p><p>In fact, it was normal. These eyeballs were evil creatures formed by the flesh and blood of their Masters, who had fought with the master of this cave mansion at the beginning of the heavenly Palace era and had their bodies blown up by the master of the cave mansion.</p><p>No matter how strong their Masters were, the flesh and blood that had been blown up had lost a lot of its spirituality after so many years. The living beings that evolved naturally wouldn’t be that strong.</p><p>Very soon, the hundreds of eyeballs were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and pressed toward Deng Xiu.</p><p>“Kid, you … You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Deng Xiu shouted in fear. He turned around and fled towards one of the many passageways.</p><p>“So it’s this passage, it saves me the trouble of looking for it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>The passageway that Deng Xiu had escaped to was most likely the place where Qiu Yue and his master were.</p><p>In his fear, Deng Xiu would most likely escape to his master.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
