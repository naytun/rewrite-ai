Come, tell me, do you still dare to hit and kill me the moment you see me in the future?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued asking.</p><p>“No, I wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>Under Lu Ming’s ‘threat’, the Indigo spirit finally gave in. Although she wanted to cut Lu Ming into eight pieces, she did not dare to force herself under such circumstances.</p><p>Until now, her father, LAN Shang, had not appeared. She knew that LAN Shang had deliberately not appeared to match her with Lu Ming.</p><p>He could not count on LAN Shang.</p><p>She felt like crying. What kind of father was he? he couldn’t wait to marry her off to someone else. It wasn’t like no one wanted her.</p><p>that’s more like it. Be more honest in the future. I, Lu Ming, am a gentleman. I won’t make things difficult for you!</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled. He waved his hand and kept the ice chains.</p><p>After all, LAN Ling was LAN Shang’s daughter. It was fine to teach her a lesson, but it would not be good to go too far.</p><p>LAN Ling gritted her teeth and felt extremely aggrieved. She despised Lu Ming and scolded him thousands of times in her heart. How could Lu Ming still have the nerve to call himself a gentleman?</p><p>Although LAN Ling hated Lu Ming, she did not dare to take any action now. She was not Lu Ming’s match.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll remember this. I’ll definitely get back at you when I break through to the divine King realm!”</p><p>LAN Ling swore in her heart.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and descended from the sky. He continued to head toward his residence with LAN Ling following behind him obediently.</p><p>LAN Shang’s courtyard.</p><p>hehe, they’re already flirting. This is a good sign, a good sign!</p><p>LAN Shang laughed a few times.</p><p>If LAN Ling were to see LAN Shang’s expression, she would probably vomit blood.</p><p>……</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming and LAN Ling arrived at Lu Ming’s courtyard.</p><p>“Young master!”</p><p>In the courtyard, Qiu Yue was practicing her swordsmanship. When she saw Lu Ming, she immediately flew out.</p><p>“Qiuyue, how’s your cultivation going?”</p><p>Lu Ming went up to him and smiled.</p><p>“I’m much more skilled now. I believe it won’t take long for me to be able to control it completely. This young lady is …”</p><p>Qiu Yue looked at LAN Ling.</p><p>Qiu Yue recognized LAN Ling. When they were leaving star-moon ancient city, LAN Ling had been staring at Lu Ming coldly. Qiu Yue had even made fun of Lu Ming.</p><p>Naturally, he was curious to see Lu Ming and LAN Ling together.</p><p>“I’m lan Ling!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could say anything, LAN Ling stepped forward and said coldly, ” “Lu Ming, I can follow you. But you must chase her away!”</p><p>Then, he pointed at Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue was slightly stunned and revealed a curious expression.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows.”Are you crazy? Qiu Yue is my wife. Why would I chase her away?” he said.</p><p>“It’s because she’s your wife that you want to chase her away!”</p><p>LAN Ling said through gritted teeth.</p><p>there’s something wrong with your brain. It’s up to you whether you want to come or not. If you don’t want to come, you can leave on your own!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and could not be bothered with LAN Ling.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Blue Spirit sword was unsheathed, and a powerful aura pressed toward Qiu Yue.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the void trembled continuously. His powerful aura directly destroyed the aura of the Indigo spirit.</p><p>“It seems that the lesson I gave you was not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at the Indigo spirit, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t care if the other party attacked him, but he couldn’t do it to Qiu Yue. No matter who the other party was, he wouldn’t be polite.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s expression, LAN Ling’s heart jumped in shock. However, as stubborn as she was, she would not retreat.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to understand what you are going to do in the future. You’re someone who’s going to do great things, and the enemies you’re going to face are all extremely powerful. So, the people by your side must not be trash and can’t be a burden to you, understand?”</p><p>LAN Ling said coldly.</p><p>Her meaning was clear. Qiu Yue was not qualified to stay by Lu Ming’s side.</p><p>get lost. Go back and tell LAN Shang that you are not needed here!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you …”</p><p>LAN Ling was furious.</p><p>Since she was young, no one had ever treated her this way. She was a beautiful woman. Any man who saw her would be obedient to her, except for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Young master, since this lady wants to test Qiu Yue’s strength, then let her try!”</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Yue spoke. She stepped forward and landed in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Qiu Yue actually had her own pride. It was just that she kept her pride in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>But that didn’t mean that others could insult or look down on her.</p><p>In particular, he had belittled her in front of Lu Ming and felt that she was not qualified to be by his side.</p><p>Therefore, Qiu Yue decided to make a move.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered but he did not stop her.</p><p>He naturally understood Qiu Yue’s temper.</p><p>Moreover, Qiu Yue was not the same as before. If they were to fight, she might not lose to LAN Ling.</p><p>“Alright, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming urged.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Qiu Yue nodded and looked at LAN Ling, ” “This young lady, make your move, just do your best!”</p><p>very good. Let me see how capable the woman that Lu Ming has his eyes on is!</p><p>LAN Ling gritted her teeth and pushed her cultivation base to its limit.</p><p>She did not know why, but when she saw how well Lu Ming treated Qiu Yue, she felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort. She could not wait to defeat Qiu Yue immediately and prove that she was stronger than her.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>LAN Ling made her move. A sword shadow was slashed out, causing the void to rumble.</p><p>However, the moment LAN Ling made her move, Qiu Yue made her move as well.</p><p>Qiu Yue’s weapon was a scimitar.</p><p>The scimitar slashed out, and the blade light was like the moon, white and dazzling.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The saber Light and the sword shadow collided, creating endless saber and sword lights. After a loud bang, the two figures were pushed back a dozen steps.</p><p>In the first exchange, the two were evenly matched.</p><p>Qiu Yue was fine, but LAN Ling’s eyes revealed shock.</p><p>She had never expected Qiu Yue to be so powerful.</p><p>Qiu Yue was only at the ninth level of the heavenly deity realm. Not only had she awakened the origin divine power factor, but she was also able to block her attacks.</p><p>This aroused her competitive spirit even more.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” divine Sword Art!   LAN Ling shouted as she circulated her divine power to the maximum and used her unique skill, the divine Sword Art.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Terrifying sword shadows burst out and slashed at Qiu Yue.</p><p>Qiu Yue let out a long roar, and nine-colored radiance emanated from her body. Combined with her saber technique, they turned into streaks of saber radiance as she launched a counterattack.</p><p>The intense battle between the two beauties in the air immediately alerted the people in the other courtyards.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
