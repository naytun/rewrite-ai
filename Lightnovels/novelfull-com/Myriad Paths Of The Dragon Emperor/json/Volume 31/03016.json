Not long after, he finally made a discovery.</p><p>A primitive godly spirit was covered in a purple-gold light, and its appearance could not be seen clearly.</p><p>However, the strange thing was that the body of this primitive God was not very big. It was only about 100 meters tall. Compared to the other primitive gods that were usually bigger than planets, it was like a speck of dust.</p><p>However, the aura it emitted was not weak at all. In fact, it was even stronger.</p><p>It punched out, and the power of its fist could penetrate several planets in a row, forcing a primitive God to retreat.</p><p>“How terrifying! This is the origin divine power of a ruler’s divine power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He stood not far away, observing and comprehending in detail.</p><p>To be able to see the original godly spirit use its original godly power at such a close distance was very touching to him.</p><p>what an exquisite divine power, what a terrifying divine power. I had thought that divine-grade divine power was the strongest divine power, but compared to this origin divine power, it’s just trash. No, it’s even worse than trash …</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. It was like a dried-up sponge, absorbing the nutrients crazily.</p><p>Lu Ming completely forgot about the time and was immersed in the understanding of the ruler’s divine power.</p><p>&Nbsp; originally, he didn’t have a deep understanding of God-level divine power. He hadn’t even awakened ten percent of it, perhaps only one or two percent. He was still thousands of miles away from truly awakening it.</p><p>But now, the degree of his awakening was rapidly increasing.</p><p>Degree of awakening: 2%, 3%, 4% …</p><p>After an unknown period of time, his awakening had reached 20%.</p><p>The speed of his improvement was shocking. Lu Ming felt that his use of the ruler’s divine power had improved.</p><p>Of course, the lower the degree of awakening, the easier it would be to awaken. The higher the degree of awakening, the harder and slower it would be to improve.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt a force acting on his body. His vision turned black again. The next moment, there was a flash of light. He opened his eyes and found that he was still sitting cross-legged on the stone platform.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the three-month period was up!</p><p>The light shield on Lu Ming’s body disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and swept his gaze across the entire venue, waiting for other people to challenge him.</p><p>However, for a moment, no one dared to rush forward.</p><p>Three months ago, Lu Ming’s display of strength was truly shocking. A ninth-tier celestial deity was killed by Lu Ming in a few moves. Without confidence, how could he have rushed to challenge Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming is too powerful. I’m not his match at all. I’d better wait for the others ‘stone platforms!</p><p>that’s right. There are a total of one hundred and eight stone platforms. On average, it takes less than a day for someone’s time to expire. Let’s wait a little longer!</p><p>Some people were discussing.</p><p>Lu Ming waited for a long time but no one challenged him.</p><p>“It seems that no one will challenge me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile. However, he did not sit cross-legged.</p><p>He looked at the stone platform above him.</p><p>The higher one went, the closer one was to the stone platform in myriad God cliff, and the better the effect.</p><p>Lu Ming was no longer satisfied with the current stone platform. He wanted to choose a stone platform with a better effect for cultivation. After all, everyone could only cultivate for three years and he could not waste time.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that Lu Ming also wants the stone platform above?”</p><p>After everyone saw Lu Ming’s status, they started to make guesses. At the same time, many people’s eyes flickered.</p><p>If Lu Ming left the current stone platform, it would be ownerless and they could fight for it.</p><p>At this moment, someone on the stone platform above Lu Ming emitted a glow. The time was almost up.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>This person was actually Jin Xing!</p><p>Lu Ming was initially considering whether he should wait for Jin Xing’s time to run out and chase him off the stone platform. He did not expect that his time was up already. What else could it be if not a coincidence?</p><p>Jin Xing opened his eyes and looked around.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming moved. His speed was shockingly fast. In a flash, he appeared on Jin Xing’s stone platform.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming, Jin Xing’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and made his move. The ice chains flew out and wrapped around Jin Xing.</p><p>However, the moment Lu Ming made his move, Jin Xing also moved. He turned into a golden light and rushed out of the stone platform.</p><p>Jin Xing was indeed one of the four heroes of the Jin family. He was very decisive.</p><p>The moment he saw Lu Ming, he knew that he was no match for him. Without any hesitation, he rushed out of the stone platform.</p><p>In this way, when Lu Ming’s attack arrived, his figure had already left. In an instant, he had rushed out of the stone platform.</p><p>“This guy runs quite fast!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I won’t let this go!”</p><p>Jin Xing stood in the crowd, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>“That stone platform is mine!”</p><p>At this moment, many people finally reacted and rushed to the stone platform where Lu Ming was previously.</p><p>A chaotic battle had begun.</p><p>After a chaotic battle, the stone platform was finally occupied by a ninth-level celestial deity.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he had defeated Jin Xing in a challenge. Naturally, no one could challenge him.</p><p>“Let’s see the effects of this stone platform first!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and waited quietly.</p><p>A day later, a light screen enveloped Lu Ming. His vision went dark again. The next moment, he came to another universe and saw a group of primitive gods fighting.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming quickly found the origin divine energy of the ruler’s divine power and began to study it.</p><p>As expected, the effects of the stone platform above were different. His comprehension was much clearer.</p><p>Lu Ming’s degree of awakening of the ruler’s divine power increased at an even faster speed.</p><p>The further he progressed, the more difficult it was to improve. However, the effect here was better. Lu Ming’s improvement speed was faster.</p><p>After three months, his awakening had reached about 45%.</p><p>“Can other people improve so quickly?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think this way.</p><p>At this rate, he would be able to reach 80% or 90% in no time.</p><p>Did the others improve so quickly?</p><p>From his previous observations, he didn’t think so.</p><p>“I’m indeed a cultivation genius!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a very narcissistic smile.</p><p>Then, he stood up and waited for others to challenge him.</p><p>Many people hesitated. For a moment, no one dared to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’m going to fight!”</p><p>Finally, someone could not help but rush up to the stone platform and stand opposite Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s have a fight. It’s just a sparring session. Let’s not fight to the death. How about it?”</p><p>The young man said.</p><p>He was not confident in facing Lu Ming. That was why he said that.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>He had no enmity with this person, so there was no need to fight to the death.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man’s aura exploded, and his divine power burned.</p><p>The young man’s cultivation base was extremely close to the half-step Divine King realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
