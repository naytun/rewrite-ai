Thank you for your reminder, brother ye!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Brother Lu, and this young lady, please. This cross-sea airboat is not small. There’s something else inside. I will show you around!</p><p>Ye Chuan said with a smile.</p><p>Since ye Chuan was so enthusiastic, Lu Ming could not reject him. Together with Xie nianqing, they followed ye Chuan through the main entrance.</p><p>Of course, Tuoba Shi had been following behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Now that the hundred beasts tribe had surrendered to Lu Ming and Tuoba Shi had been defeated by him in one move, he admired Lu Ming very much and had become Lu Ming’s subordinate.</p><p>This warship was really big. It had everything: living rooms, cultivation places, pill refining rooms, and equipment refining rooms.</p><p>There were even restaurants where one could order food and drink, but one had to pay with raw stones.</p><p>Ye Chuan brought Lu Ming and the rest on a tour, which broadened their horizons.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming and the rest randomly chose a room to stay in.</p><p>Even though the cross-sea flying ship was extremely fast, the distance between the divine wilderness continent and the divine Ruins continent was really quite far. Even with the cross-sea flying ship, it would still take a month to fly.</p><p>Hence, they would have to spend this time on the ship.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The ship’s body trembled slightly as the ship started to fly towards the North. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared from the sky above the geocentric Lake.</p><p>After the ship started flying, it completely stabilized as if it was on flat ground.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the room and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing went to the restaurant to get something to eat.</p><p>When he arrived at the restaurant, he saw a few familiar faces.</p><p>Shi du and Kong Lin were sitting at the same table. After seeing Lu Ming, a deep fear flashed in their eyes.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had defeated Mu Feng with one move. His combat strength had shocked them.</p><p>Lu Ming also saw Long Chen sitting alone at a table, slowly drinking wine.</p><p>Lu Ming saw two bald heads at another table.</p><p>It was moonless and the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>At this time, moonless was slowly sipping her tea, while the unscrupulous monk picked up a large piece of monster meat and gnawed on it, his mouth full of oil.</p><p>When he saw Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, the monk shouted, ” “Almsgiver Lu, miss Xie, come, this way please, my treat!”</p><p>master, please go ahead. I won’t disturb you any longer!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and walked to the side with Xie nianqing.</p><p>On the other side of the table, a beautiful woman in white was sitting alone. It was Xie nianjun.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, Xie nianjun’s cold gaze fell on Xie nianqing. He said coldly, ” when we return to the divine wilderness continent, I will definitely take you down with my own hands and seal you back into the nine Underworlds demon territory!</p><p>“You? Don’t worry, there’s no need to return to the divine wilderness. In the divine Ruins, I will trample you under my feet!”</p><p>Xie nianqing retorted.</p><p>Then, he pulled Lu Ming to a table at the side, ignoring Xie nianjun.</p><p>At the entrance of a passageway, Mu Feng witnessed the scene.</p><p>it turns out that these two beautiful women who look almost identical are not in the same group. They seem to have a grudge. Hehe, then I’ll take down The Woman in White first. As for Lu Ming and The Woman in Black, when we reach the divine Ruins continent, Hmph!</p><p>Mu Feng snorted.</p><p>Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were a pair of beautiful sisters with unique temperaments. Mu Feng’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>At first, he thought that Xie nianjun was on Lu Ming’s side when he saw how close Xie nianqing and Lu Ming were. He was afraid of Lu Ming and did not dare to take any action. However, now that he saw that Xie nianjun was not on Lu Ming’s side, his heart was suddenly filled with excitement.</p><p>Mu Feng smiled charmingly and walked towards Xie nianjun. He stopped in front of Xie nianjun’s table and said, ” “Young lady, may I sit here?”</p><p>Xie nianjun glanced at Mu Feng coldly and did not say anything.</p><p>Mu Feng’s eyes narrowed as he sat down and said, ” my name is Mu Feng. I believe you have heard of me. There are many things that you need to pay attention to on your trip to the divine Ruins continent. The divine Ruins is not like the divine wilderness. The divine wilderness is a small place, but there are many experts and geniuses in the divine Ruins. I can tell you about the things that you need to pay attention to in case you take a wrong path …</p><p>Mu Feng spoke with a hint of pride in his tone. you’re from a small place, so you should be more careful when you get to a bigger place. But it’s okay, I can give you some advice.</p><p>In Mu Feng’s heart, the fact that he was willing to tell Xie nianjun all this was already a sign that he was taking good care of her.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s cold voice echoed throughout the restaurant.</p><p>Mu Feng’s words came to an abrupt end. Then, a cold light flashed in his eyes as he said, ” “Young lady, what are you saying?”</p><p>“Get lost, can’t you hear me?”</p><p>Xie nianjun said coldly. He looked at Mu Feng with a hint of disgust.</p><p>how dare you, you b * tch! I was kind enough to give you advice, but you don’t know how to appreciate my kindness and even dare to insult me. Now, kneel down and apologize!</p><p>Mu Feng’s face was extremely gloomy as he coldly rebuked.</p><p>His heart was filled with anger. In the beginning, Lu Ming was the one who had the audacity to injure him. He was filled with anger. Now, even a mere Xie nianjun dared to berate him like that. Who did he think he was?</p><p>Xie nianjun glanced at Mu Feng with disdain, then stood up and left.</p><p>Since Mu Feng was still shamelessly refusing to leave, she had no choice but to leave.</p><p>b * tch, if you want to leave, kneel down and admit your mistake. Be my maidservant for three years!</p><p>Mu Feng shouted coldly as he threw a palm at Xie nianjun.</p><p>Xie nianjun turned around and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two palms collided. Xie nianjun’s body trembled and he was forced to take five steps back. Mu Feng, on the other hand, took three steps back.</p><p>fourth level spiritual God Realm. You’re quite capable. However, you’ve only just broken through to the fourth level spiritual God Realm and you want to fight me? it’s still too early!</p><p>Mu Feng’s expression changed at first. Clearly, he did not expect that the divine wilderness continent would first produce an expert like Lu Ming. Now, this woman’s cultivation was also so profound, reaching the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>However, Mu Feng’s expression immediately turned cold, and the fire in his eyes became even more intense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Mu Feng’s palm continued to attack Xie nianjun.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, a wine cup broke through the void and flew towards Mu Feng’s face. The wine cup brought with it a terrifying wind that disrupted Mu Feng’s palm technique.</p><p>“Who is it? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Mu Feng smashed the wine glass into pieces. He scanned the scene coldly and finally stopped at Long Chen.</p><p>The wine cup had just flown out of Long Chen’s hand.</p><p>“Kid, it’s you?”</p><p>Mu Feng stared at Long Chen coldly.</p><p>“Let her go!”</p><p>Long Chen said calmly.</p><p>“Haha, kid, Who Do You Think You Are? Overestimating yourself, I’ll cripple you right now and see how much you’re worth!”</p><p>Mu Feng shouted coldly.</p><p>He was furious.</p><p>These pieces of trash from the divine wilderness continent did not even put him in their eyes. They were simply detestable and deserved to die!</p><p>Did they really think he was a pushover?</p><p>First, it was Lu Ming, then Xie nianjun, and now, it was long Chen.</p><p>The killing intent in his heart was already incomparably thick.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
