He did not expect that Lu Ming would suddenly make things difficult for him on such an occasion.</p><p>...</p><p>in his shock, he activated his space intent and used transient step to retreat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm pierced through the space, and the terrifying power rushed toward the Emperor God.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The Emperor God was shocked and roared in his heart. He tried to resist with all his power and operated the space will to the extreme.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A terrifying force gushed out, and the Emperor God’s body flew a thousand meters away. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face turned pale.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and continued to attack the Emperor God.</p><p>“Lu Ming …”</p><p>A long howl resounded between heaven and earth. A dazzling golden light bloomed, and a shocking sword Qi appeared in the sky, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>It was Di Yi. The sovereigns were gathered today, and he was naturally present. However, Lu Ming’s sudden attack on the Emperor God was beyond his expectations. At this moment, he was filled with killing intent and wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“Di Yi, why are you interfering in the matters of the younger generation? If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the sky. A vast demonic light destroyed Di Yi’s sword Qi. Xie Luan appeared in front of Di Yi.</p><p>“Xie Luan, get lost!”</p><p>Di Yi shouted and rushed toward Xie Luan.</p><p>“As a junior, don’t you know how to respect your seniors?”</p><p>Xie Luan smiled faintly and fought with Di Yi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure did not stop at all. He exerted his extreme speed and quickly approached the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God tried to run away by operating his space will.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>nine seals of the divine Gate, ” Lu Ming said indifferently. He cast the nine seals of the divine Gate. Two gates of sealing condensed on the left and right sides of the Emperor God. They shone with brilliant light and pressed down on the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God felt the space around him was like a swamp, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Space, chaos!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s eyes were red. He roared madly and tried to escape by self-mutilating.</p><p>But to his despair, another sealing door appeared behind him and enveloped him.</p><p>Three sealing gates. After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming had also achieved a breakthrough in the nine seals of the gate of God and was able to form three sealing gates.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Emperor God screamed in fear. He couldn’t escape.</p><p>Lu Ming strolled forward and punched di Shen’s dantian. A terrifying force gushed in and pierced through di Shen’s dantian. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The Emperor God’s angry voice came from above.</p><p>“Stop? Ha-ha, Di Yi, why didn’t you stop when you went to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed. His palm was like a knife, and he chopped off the Emperor God’s head, cutting it in half.</p><p>The Emperor God, who stood at the top of the younger generation in the East barren and ranked first on the list of top 1000 talents in the East barren, was dead!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a loud boom in the sky. Di Yi and Xie Luan exchanged a blow, but they retreated far away and did not continue to fight.</p><p>Di Yi’s eyes looked at Lu Ming very coldly. His murderous intent was so strong that it could not be dispersed.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered and looked at Di Yi.</p><p>Didn’t Di Yi want to take him down and deprive him of his nine Dragon bloodline because of his high cultivation? Then I’ll kill his strongest descendant now to collect some interest.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, good kill. This is how a man should be. Take revenge!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed loudly, causing the members of the Royal Xie family to have ugly expressions.</p><p>Di Yi, I’ll kill di Shen today, and I’ll kill you in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke, his voice spreading out like a storm.</p><p>The people of the divine wilderness continent were shocked.</p><p>Just now, Xie Luan had fought with Di Yi for a short time and displayed amazing combat power, which was far beyond that of an ordinary Emperor, which shocked them.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s courage was even more shocking. He said that he would kill Di Yi in the future.</p><p>Di Yi was so powerful, and Lu Ming was so confident?</p><p>“I’ll be waiting!”</p><p>Di Yi said coldly. He glanced at Xie Luan and the people from the continent of the divine Ruins, then turned around, took a step, and disappeared.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man muttered, feeling that this was even more interesting.</p><p>“Senior, I’ve finished my business!”</p><p>Lu Ming came to the black-robed middle-aged man and cupped his fists.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The black-robed man nodded.</p><p>“Senior, this junior has a question to ask!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. Everyone looked over and saw that it was long Chen.</p><p>“What do you want? Go ahead and ask!” The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>senior, if I am chosen by a large sect in the yuan continent to be their disciple, do I have to head to the yuan continent immediately? if I want to return to the divine wilderness continent to settle some personal matters, I will need some time. Is that allowed? ”</p><p>Long Chen asked.</p><p>The others, including Lu Ming, had the same expression.</p><p>This question was exactly what he wanted to ask.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re really delusional. Who Do You Think You Are? The major sects of the yuanlu continent will choose you? I’m only giving you a chance by letting you go, but the hope is slim. You’re overestimating your own abilities!”</p><p>Before the Man in Black could answer, Mu Feng sneered and looked at Long Chen with disdain.</p><p>Long Chen glanced at Mu Feng indifferently, then ignored him and continued to look at the middle-aged man in Black.</p><p>The middle-aged man in Black frowned. It was obvious that he did not like Mu Feng’s temper. He glared at Mu Feng coldly, causing Mu Feng’s expression to change and he shut up obediently.</p><p>the big sects in yuanlu are naturally reasonable. They will definitely allow this. After all, you can only go to yuanlu after you’ve finished all your private affairs. Only then can you focus on your cultivation!</p><p>The middle-aged man in Black clothes said, giving a definite answer.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Even if he had been chosen by a major sect in the yuanlu continent, he would definitely have to come back to settle some matters.</p><p>First of all, he would not be at ease if Di Yi did not solve it.</p><p>In addition, his second body was still cultivating in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. When he went to the yuan continent in the future, he would definitely bring his second body along.</p><p>“Do you guys have any more questions? Let’s ask them together to avoid any doubts!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>Everyone shook their heads, indicating that there was no more.</p><p>“Alright, since there’s nothing, let’s board the ship!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>He then turned around and flew onto the warship. Lu Ming and the other twelve people also flew onto the warship one by one.</p><p>The warship was huge and extremely wide. The deck was a few thousand meters long and wide. Behind the deck was a door with some houses and the like.</p><p>Mu Feng’s cold gaze swept across Lu Ming and the rest, especially Xie nianjun and Xie nianqing. He snorted coldly and took the lead to walk through the door.</p><p>“Brother Lu! I’m ye Chuan!”</p><p>At this moment, a young man came to Lu Ming and cupped his fists.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized them. They were the two young men who had been following behind the middle-aged man in Black. They had a gentle smile on their faces.</p><p>“Brother ye, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>haha, it’s nothing big. It’s just that I admire brother Lu’s combat strength, so I want to make friends with you!</p><p>Ye Chuan said with a smile.</p><p>brother ye, you’re too polite. How can such insignificant skills be compared to the divine Ruins continent’s prodigies? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was polite.</p><p>Ye Chuan smiled and lowered his voice. brother Lu, Mu Feng is a narrow-minded person. If you go to the divine Ruins continent, brother Lu, you have to be careful of this person’s Secret tricks!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
