His sword power was vast and mighty, shattering the sky. He slashed out a shocking sword light, which hit the giant Pagoda and stopped it. However, on the other side, Xie Luan’s demonic fist arrived again.</p><p>...</p><p>Endless sword Qi floated around the Supreme martial artist of the tianwu Sword School. It finally gathered into a sword, and like a thousand swords returning to their roots, it stabbed toward Xie Luan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie Luan’s demonic fist struck the sword Qi, causing it to shake violently before finally collapsing.</p><p>Although the Supreme martial artist of the tianwu Sword School was strong, he had to resist the Emperor spiritual weapon and Xie Luan at the same time. He was already at a disadvantage.</p><p>spirit body, you’re a spirit body. You’re an Emperor? ”</p><p>Seeing Xie Luan destroy his sword Qi with a single punch, the other party immediately cried out in alarm.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie Luan bellowed as he strode forward, his demonic fist crushing down on his opponent.</p><p>Above him, the giant Pagoda trembled and continued to suppress the other party.</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial Sword School was shocked. He immediately used the bloodline fusion and transformed into a combat sword.</p><p>His bloodline was at the sixth level of the divine level, which was equivalent to the clan heads of the six great ancient clans of the Emperor heaven divine Palace. The bloodline fusion had improved his combat strength, but Xie Luan was unrivaled. His immortal demonic body was terrifying. If he was at his peak, he could crush an Emperor.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Xie Luan’s demonic fist continued to strike out. At the same time, the giant Pagoda also came down. The flame domain in the giant Pagoda enveloped the Supreme-being of the tianwu Sword School, causing him to be suppressed by the terrifyingly high temperature.</p><p>Although the Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial Sword School tried his best to slash out a shocking sword Qi, it was still useless. He was suppressed and had less and less power to fight back.</p><p>go, all of you, quickly go and inform the sect leader!</p><p>The Supreme martial artist from the heavenly martial sword faction roared.</p><p>Some of the higher-stage spiritual God Realm Warriors who were still alive looked at the battle in the sky in horror. The Supreme martial artist of the heavenly martial Sword School was actually at a complete disadvantage and could be defeated at any time.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Some people flew away, trying to escape and inform the Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving!”</p><p>die! Xie Luan’s demonic Qi soared to the sky as he punched out a fist radiance that pierced through the void for thousands of miles. A few spirit God experts were instantly enveloped by the fist radiance and killed mercilessly.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Xie Luan’s demonic fist continued to bombard the sword, causing the sword to tremble.</p><p>Originally, Xie Luan’s current battle strength wasn’t any weaker than his opponent’s, and with the help of the Emperor spirit weapon, Xie Luan’s strength was far above his opponent.</p><p>After more than 10 punches, the sword collapsed, revealing the true body of the man who was retreating in horror.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant Pagoda pressed down, and the other party tried his best to block it. However, he was still knocked by the giant Pagoda and spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Xie Luan rushed over and punched his opponent’s chest. His opponent screamed as his chest was pierced through. A large hole appeared, and his heart was shattered.</p><p>His opponent’s dantian glowed, and his spiritual God rushed out in an attempt to escape. However, Xie Luan grabbed his spiritual God and crushed it with a sudden squeeze. His spiritual God was crushed into a stream of energy that Xie Luan absorbed.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist had been killed by Xie Huan just like that.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The giant tower glowed and enveloped the entire branch of the heavenly martial sword faction. The remaining members of the heavenly martial sword faction were all killed. Not a single one was left.</p><p>Xie Luan transformed into demonic Qi and enveloped all the experts of the heavenly Sword sect, becoming his tonic.</p><p>“Save some for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming flew at top speed, collecting the storage rings one by one. Unfortunately, those experts had all become Xie Luan’s tonics, not leaving a single one for him.</p><p>what a pity! Lu Ming cried out. However, he had just devoured three eighth level spiritual God Realm experts and there were impurities in them. He needed some time to polish them and stabilize his Foundation. If he continued devouring, his Foundation might become even more unstable. At the thought of this, Lu Ming felt relieved and continued to collect the storage rings.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming had put away all the storage rings.</p><p>However, Xie Luan did not give Lu Ming the Supreme martial artist’s storage ring. He kept it for himself. The Supreme martial artist’s wealth must have tempted Xie Luan.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After absorbing all the tonics, Xie Lun transformed into a human and punched the ground. A shocking demonic Qi shot up into the sky from the ground, and a terrible pressure spread out.</p><p>“This … Why do I feel like I’m facing the demon Empress?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Could it be that a demon Emperor was hiding underground? How was this possible?</p><p>as expected, the heavenly martial Sword School is very ambitious. They’re actually secretly making a demon fetus!</p><p>Xie Luan muttered to himself, an ecstatic smile on his face.</p><p>“Senior, what is a demon fetus?”</p><p>Lu Ming came to Xie Luan’s side and looked down.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the air underground. A tall human-shaped figure could be vaguely seen in the demonic Qi. The rolling demonic Qi was coming from this figure.</p><p>the tianwu sword sect must have obtained the corpse of a fallen demon Emperor, and then refined it with a special method. In the end, it can be refined into a powerful existence under the tianwu sword sect’s command. This existence is the demon fetus. Once it’s refined, it will have the combat power of an Emperor. It seems that the tianwu sword sect is far from finished refining it, and now it’s all mine!</p><p>after refining this demon fetus, my strength can be restored to the Emperor realm!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed and transformed into a ball of demonic Qi. It flew down and wrapped around the tall figure, and began to refine it.</p><p>Lu Ming could only wait at the side.</p><p>Soon, half an hour had passed.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>In the sky, the space was suddenly torn open, and a middle-aged man in a white robe with a sword on his back stepped out of the spatial crack.</p><p>The middle-aged man looked around as soon as he stepped out of the spatial crack. Suddenly, a sword power that seemed to be able to destroy the world burst out and covered the territory within a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>“The Emperor, it’s the Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted sharply. He was extremely shocked.</p><p>He knew that the Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School had arrived.</p><p>This was a sword Emperor that could slash the world with his sword.</p><p>The Emperor of the heavenly martial sword faction looked at Lu Ming, but his gaze only swept past him and landed on the ball of demonic Qi on the ground.</p><p>“I don’t care who you are. Since you dared to destroy one of my Heavenly Sword faction’s divisions, you won’t be able to leave today!”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School waved his hand, and a dazzling sword Qi shot toward Xie Luan. The power of the sword Qi was several times stronger than that of the Supreme-being.</p><p>“Haha, a junior dares to be impudent in front of me!”</p><p>Within the demonic Qi, a loud laugh came out. A jet-black fist radiance flew out and collided with the sword Qi.</p><p>The fist radiance and the sword Qi collided, stirring up an endless energy storm. All the mountains and mountains within a radius of ten thousand miles were swept by the energy storm, directly cracking and exploding into pieces.</p><p>With one move, he destroyed the mountains and rivers within a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>A battle between emperors was too terrifying. It could destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>Although Lu Ming was under the protection of Xie Luan’s demonic aura, he was still shocked by the power.</p><p>the power of an Emperor is indeed shocking. It’s far from what I can match now!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>whoosh …</p><p>Endless demonic Qi rolled, and Xie Luan’s figure flickered in and out of sight. A Supreme aura emanated from his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
