Fight!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming raised his fist and punched at Shi du continuously. Shi du roared in anger and tried his best but it was useless. He was defeated by Lu Ming’s fist and landed heavily on his body.</p><p>The lion’s huge body shook like a drum, and its soft golden fur was beaten into a mess. In the end, it was broken and flew on the platform, making the platform golden.</p><p>“I can’t waste it!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his sleeve and kept the Golden fur that had fallen from Shi DU’s body. This was an incredible treasure. If it was woven into a robe, it would have a strong defensive ability and would be impervious to fire and water.</p><p>Some people in the crowd were envious. This golden fur was a rare treasure.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Shi du looked up at the sky in shame and anger, wishing he could bite Lu Ming to death. Unfortunately, he could not do it and was even forced to retreat by Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming simply rode on the lion Capital and swung his fists wildly.</p><p>The lion Capital roared in anger and sorrow. It even rolled on the ground, but it was useless. It could not shake off Lu Ming. Every punch of Lu Ming’s was terrifyingly powerful and suppressed everything. It kept smashing on the lion capital’s body. With every punch, the lion Capital felt that its bones were about to break and blood kept flowing out of its mouth.</p><p>A demonic beast’s body was extremely strong, especially a demonic beast like him who had 90% of the divine beast’s bloodline. His body was even stronger. However, he still could not withstand Lu Ming’s Iron Fist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the end, the lion fell heavily to the ground, gasping for breath.</p><p>Even the lion was defeated!</p><p>This thought flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>Before this battle, no one would have thought that the lion City would be defeated by this strange commander of the law enforcement Army. This was like a fantasy story, but it was the truth!</p><p>Although the lion Capital was ranked last among the five Giants of the central continent, no one dared to underestimate its strength. Those second-grade heaven’s favorites would only be crushed by the lion Capital.</p><p>But now, he was no match for the commander of the law enforcement Army.</p><p>“How is it? Are you convinced now? Be my Mount!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the lion Capital and looked down at him.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The lion howled madly and soared into the sky, rushing out of the platform.</p><p>Even if he were to lose, he would drag Lu Ming down with him.</p><p>nest, come at me. Forget it, I’ll spare you this time!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and his body flew backward. He kicked Shi DU’s buttocks and sent him flying far away, landing outside the platform.</p><p>Lion City, defeated!</p><p>Shi du let out a long roar as if he wanted to vent the depression in his heart. After a dozen roars, he transformed into his human form and sat on the seat of the lion Tiger Hall with an extremely gloomy expression.</p><p>He had actually been eliminated before he could make it into the top ten.</p><p>The main reason was that he had to deal with Lu Ming, which led to him being eliminated early.</p><p>At this moment, there were only twelve people left on the platform.</p><p>Kong Lin was still chasing after Emperor God, but the Emperor God used the space mentality and dodged with all his might instead of fighting Kong Lin. With the Emperor God’s cultivation and the mystery of space mentality, it was still difficult for Kong Lin to catch up with the Emperor God even though he was very fast.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Kong Lin stopped. He did not continue to pursue the Emperor God. Instead, he looked at Lu Ming with a grave expression.</p><p>It was completely beyond his expectations that Shi du did not manage to take down Lu Ming and was instead defeated by him.</p><p>At this moment, the situation was in a stalemate again.</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling stood on the side of the platform together. Long Chen had not moved since the battle began.</p><p>Kong Lin could not catch up with the Emperor God and he was afraid of Lu Ming. He was also a suitor of the sandalwood fairy. Naturally, he would not attack the sandalwood fairy and the jingkongling.</p><p>As for the Emperor God, it was obvious that he intended to use the advantage of the space will to delay as much as possible and enter the top ten when the others were defeated. Therefore, he would not launch an attack first.</p><p>Yang potian and Tuoba Shi were still engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The battle between the Western Desert and the southern nether was even more intense.</p><p>At this point in the battle, the difference in strength had already been revealed.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk was fighting the young man covered in black flames. At this time, the young man in Black flames had transformed into his true form. He was also a demonic beast.</p><p>He looked almost the same as the legendary three-headed hell hound. The youth in black flames had 90% of the three-headed hell hound’s bloodline and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Each of the three heads could launch a different attack. Black flames filled the air, but they were not hot at all. Instead, they gave off an extremely cold feeling.</p><p>It was as if this flame could freeze the soul.</p><p>This was the infernal flames!</p><p>The three-headed hell hound was strong, but the unscrupulous monk was even stronger.</p><p>The monk was solemn, and his body was covered in golden light. A Golden Buddha floated above his head, and the Buddha’s light suppressed the three-headed hell hound.</p><p>The three-headed hell hound was completely suppressed by the Golden Buddhist light. Phenomena appeared all around it, and it was in an extremely sorry state.</p><p>On the other side, the battle between Dark Child and the female Bodhisattva was also extremely intense.</p><p>However, The Dark Child was indeed very powerful. He was the strongest in the southern underworld’s generation, even stronger than the Cerberus. His dark Qi soared to the sky and suppressed the female Bodhisattva.</p><p>However, the Buddhist martial techniques were extremely profound and could attack and defend.</p><p>The female Bodhisattva performed the blood fusion and transformed into a true female Buddha. The Buddha light spread out and formed many Buddha walls. Although she was at a disadvantage, she could still barely resist.</p><p>they’re so powerful. Each of them is above Lion City and is at the third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and could tell their cultivation.</p><p>Like yang potian and Tuoba Shi, the four great prodigies of the Western Desert and the southern underworld were all at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. Each of their combat strength was above that of Lion City.</p><p>“Stinky dog, lose!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk became more and more courageous as the battle progressed. His combat strength was unfathomable, and he completely suppressed the three-headed hell hound.</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound tried its best to block while scanning the entire area with its spiritual sense.</p><p>I can’t go on like this. There are still twelve people left on the field. If this continues, I’ll be defeated by this bald monk and won’t even be able to enter the top ten. Those two women are weak. I’ll take care of them first. Even if I’m defeated, I can still enter the top ten!</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound’s mind raced as it made a decision.</p><p>Then, he used all his strength to block the monk’s attack. His body flashed and he turned into a black light, rushing toward goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling.</p><p>It was as fast as lightning and arrived in an instant.</p><p>“Block!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s reaction was extremely fast. With a light step, dense runes appeared on the ground, forming a few formations. A few shields appeared in front of her.</p><p>At the same time, the pure space spirit moved as well. A River appeared, and within the river, ancient trees grew. The branches stretched out and blocked the way.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, the inferno spread and burned the shield and the ancient trees.</p><p>However, after this block, the follow-up moves of goddess Tan Xiang and the pure spatial spirit also exploded out.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang’s body glowed as she activated the killing formation she had carved. At the same time, she waved her hand, and 36 pills flew out, turning into 36 divine weapons. Together with the pure spatial Spirit’s attack, they attacked the three-headed Hellhound.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
