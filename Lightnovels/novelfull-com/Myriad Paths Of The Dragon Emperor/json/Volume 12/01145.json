The closer they got, the more the prison-suppressing stele bloodline in Lu Ming’s body throbbed and felt hot.</p><p>Soon, the two of them were a hundred miles away from the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>There was already a faint black mist permeating the air.</p><p>The two of them didn’t back off and continued to move forward. In the blink of an eye, they had crossed a hundred miles and entered the devil tablet mountain’s territory.</p><p>“Mo, mo, mo!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud roar rang in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>This voice was filled with a lawless feeling, but it also revealed a sense of helplessness and unwillingness.</p><p>Black mist filled the air. With their cultivation, they could only see within twenty meters.</p><p>Moreover, there was a terrifying pressure on the two of them, making it difficult for them to fly. They could only land on the ground and walk forward.</p><p>“Little Qing, be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and walked forward carefully.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spine was suffused with a blood-red light. The prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was beating continuously and it was getting stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline and did not let it manifest.</p><p>The two of them walked for half a day and felt that they were already halfway up the mountain. They were getting closer and closer to the peak.</p><p>That throbbing feeling came from the top of the mountain.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s presence here also had a strong attraction to it, and it made her bloodline throb.</p><p>“Eh? So many bones!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming noticed that there were skeletons on the ground.</p><p>The skeleton wasn’t big, and it was obvious that it was from the devil clan.</p><p>It was rumored that many of the devil clan had died here. It seemed to be true.</p><p>Furthermore, these skeletons all had storage rings on their fingers.</p><p>Xie nianqing grabbed a storage ring in the air. The next moment, he took out a pile of black stones from the storage ring. The stones emitted a strong demonic Qi.</p><p>this is a demonic stone. It’s very useful for those who cultivate the demonic path. To me, it’s even more useful than a raw stone!</p><p>Xie nianqing explained.</p><p>there are many storage rings here. They might contain magic stones. Take them. They will be of great use to you when we leave this place in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming said. He reached out and drew in the storage rings one by one, handing them to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing cultivated the demonic Dao, so these demonic stones were most suitable for him.</p><p>Xie nianqing took them and kept them one by one.</p><p>Then, the two of them searched around and found many bones of the mo Sha clan. Of course, there were also the bones of humans, but they were very few.</p><p>“Devil! Devil! Devil!”</p><p>At this point, the sound became louder and louder. This sound was directly transmitted to the mind and not through the ears.</p><p>It was as if there was a peerless demon Emperor shouting and roaring from above.</p><p>The two of them continued to move forward. Along the way, they collected the storage rings of every devil clan skeleton they came across. Along the way, they collected no less than a hundred storage rings and a large number of demonic stones.</p><p>Just these storage rings alone were a huge profit.</p><p>After another half a day, the two of them finally reached the top of the mountain.</p><p>The two of them did not encounter any danger along the way.</p><p>This made the two of them secretly amazed.</p><p>The devil tablet mountain was very dangerous and anyone who entered would die!</p><p>This sentence could be verified by the bones of the devil clan and human clan along the way. However, the two of them had been very calm along the way. Other than the constant demonic sounds, there was no other movement.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>When he arrived, Lu Ming’s spine was filled with a bloody light. The prison-suppressing stele’s Blood Meridian was beating wildly. Even Lu Ming himself could not suppress it.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele emerged with a loud vibration. It expanded rapidly and shook violently.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of them, on the mountaintop, there was a terrifying tremor. Then, they saw the black fog roll and split into two. The scenery in front of them was completely exposed.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Seeing the scene in front of them, their hearts trembled and they were dumbfounded.</p><p>There was another stone tablet in front of him. A stone tablet!</p><p>This stone tablet was extremely huge. It was like a majestic mountain.</p><p>On the stone tablet, there was only one big word-tablet!</p><p>There was only one word,’tablet’, at the top of the stone tablet. It was uneven, as if it was not a complete stone tablet, but only a part of it.</p><p>The stone tablet was filled with an ancient aura. Its color was very similar to Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline flew out and stopped in front of the stele. The two of them kept shaking and emitted a bright light, as if they were responding to each other.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming, why do I feel that your bloodline is so similar to this stone tablet? it’s as if they’re one!”</p><p>Xie nianqing was extremely surprised.</p><p>Lu Ming himself was also extremely shocked.</p><p>This was because he felt that this stone tablet gave him a very familiar feeling. He knew that the throbbing earlier had all come from this stone tablet.</p><p>The two stone tablets trembled, and brilliant light filled the air. The Mosha clansmen around the devil tablet mountain also noticed it.</p><p>“The strange movement of the devil tablet mountain, could it be that a peerless treasure has appeared?”</p><p>it’s a brilliant light. A peerless demonic treasure has appeared. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>Figures gathered at the devil tablet mountain one after another. Each of them exuded a mighty demonic aura. They were all experts from the devil clan. Even the weakest among them was at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. There were even experts at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>A group of Mo Sha appeared a hundred miles away from the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>At this moment, the black mist on the top of the devil tablet mountain became very thin. One could clearly see the huge stone tablet shining brightly.</p><p>However, the devil clan stopped here and didn’t dare to go any closer. The devil tablet mountain’s reputation wasn’t just for show. Anyone who entered would die, so they stopped.</p><p>However, when they saw the stone monument shining with a blinding light, the devil clan couldn’t help but give in.</p><p>“Now that the devil tablet mountain has changed, it might not be dangerous!”</p><p>that’s right. I saw that human girl go in and bring out a devil statue. Nothing happened to it. It’s time for the devil tablet mountain to come out!</p><p>Shriveled sounds rang out one after another, and the eyes of many of the Mosha clansmen shone with a scorching light.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>A portion of the mo Sha finally couldn’t take it anymore and roared as they charged towards the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>As soon as they entered the range of the devil tablet mountain, a voice rang out in their minds, ” Devil! Devil! Devil!</p><p>The demonic sound filled his mind and was filled with a terrifying destructive power.</p><p>A few of the fifth and sixth level spiritual God Realm demons screamed in pain. Their bodies were like dumplings in a pot, falling from the sky and landing on the ground. They were no longer breathing.</p><p>Dead. At least twenty of them had died in an instant.</p><p>A few of the seventh level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha clansmen roared and retreated frantically, blood flowing from their seven orifices.</p><p>“It can obliterate souls!”</p><p>A seventh level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha clan member roared and retreated hundreds of miles in fear.</p><p>The other Mo Sha clansmen who didn’t move forward were rejoicing. They were rejoicing that they had held back. Otherwise, they would probably end up the same way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
