You have misunderstood me. You have misunderstood me too. Someone must have framed me. I am a monk. I am merciful and will save all living beings. Who is the one who slandered this little monk? Tell me, I’m going to kill him with one palm!”</p><p>...</p><p>The unscrupulous monk put his palms together and looked solemn. The first part of his sentence was quite normal, but the last part made people look at each other in dismay.</p><p>Outside the platform, the moonless female Bodhisattva put her hands together, the veins on her face twitching.</p><p>Yang potian’s lips also trembled as he said, ” no need to say anything more. Let me try master’s means!</p><p>Yang potian transformed into the halberd of the void and started fighting the monk without any hesitation.</p><p>Without a doubt, the unscrupulous monk’s bloodline was also at the ninth level of the divine level. He was a Golden Buddha with a solemn expression and a benevolent face. He was able to deliver all living beings from suffering and was emitting a boundless Buddhist light.</p><p>The crowd was speechless. How could such a weirdo like this monk awaken such a Supreme Buddhist bloodline?</p><p>The two of them fought and occupied half of the platform.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing, let’s fight!”</p><p>A black light flashed and dark Child appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>There was no need to say more. Lu Ming spat out a single word, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p>As long as he defeated Dark Child, the unscrupulous monk and yang potian would determine the winner and Lu Ming would be able to enter the top three.</p><p>His goal was to enter the top three, and he had to enter the top three.</p><p>Endless black nether energy burst out from Dark child’s body. Ghostly wails came out from within, which was extremely horrifying.</p><p>A blade appeared in his hand. It was a black scimitar with evil ghosts emerging on it as if they were about to crawl out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dark Child rushed toward Lu Ming, his scimitar slashing down. Ghostly wails and wolf howls filled the air with a sinister aura.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. His killing intent surged like a tide. The blood-red spear turned back into a drop of blood and floated above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming used the prison suppressing heaven technique and struck out with his palm, clashing with Dark child’s Saber Light.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The sounds of concentrated collisions rang out, and the two exchanged more than a dozen moves in an instant.</p><p>“So cold, what a strange attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming felt a chill all over his body. Not only that, but even the spiritual God felt a chill.</p><p>Dark child’s attack could not only damage the physical body but also affect the spiritual God.</p><p>The five-colored intent realm curled around him, forming a battle suit that covered his entire body. His true essence flowed continuously, blocking Dark child’s strange attack.</p><p>At the same time, he struck out with his palms.</p><p>Each palm strike had a terrifying power.</p><p>With the power of seven dragons and the power of the third bloodline, he was extremely powerful.</p><p>However, Dark Child was indeed terrifying. Even among the young tyrants, he was a top existence. He had awakened a ninth level divine bloodline, and the power enhanced by the bloodline itself was also very terrifying.</p><p>The bloodline secret skills and bloodline martial techniques that were comprehended from the bloodline were extremely powerful.</p><p>The power of a divine level rank 9 bloodline far exceeded the power of seven Dragon powers.</p><p>Moreover, Dark child’s intent realm was very terrifying. There were several types. Although there were not as many types as Lu Ming’s, its level was higher and its power was not much weaker than Lu Ming’s.</p><p>It could be said that heaven’s favorites who had reached the level of the top young warriors were very strong in all aspects.</p><p>The highest level of Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian was only at divine Level Seven.</p><p>The third bloodline, on the other hand, had endless power, but Lu Ming did not dare to borrow too much. The more he borrowed, the stronger the killing intent would be. Lu Ming would then be controlled by the endless killing intent. Once he lost control of himself, he would be dominated by the killing and become a walking corpse, a puppet that only knew how to kill.</p><p>Of course, with the improvement of Lu Ming’s cultivation, he had better control over himself and the power he could borrow was also stronger. Now, the power he could borrow had increased a lot compared to when he was at the first level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>Lu Ming formed a seal and two gates of God appeared, suppressing Dark Child.</p><p>“Nether prison’s Gate!”</p><p>A black door appeared in front of Dark Child. The door glowed and expanded rapidly, blocking the sealing door.</p><p>“Death god, appear!”</p><p>Then, a black figure appeared above Dark child’s head. The figure was covered in a black cloak and his appearance couldn’t be seen clearly. Only two red flames were dancing and burning in his eyes.</p><p>The figure held a black sickle in his hand, with black fire dancing around it.</p><p>The god of death, the legendary god of death!</p><p>This was The Dark Child’s bloodline. Without a doubt, it was also a level nine divine level.</p><p>“Twelve Capital Heaven battle formation!”</p><p>Dark Child transformed into the Grim Reaper and spoke in a cold and unpleasant voice. The Grim Reaper moved and turned into 12 figures, charging toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the gate of sealing again, but he could only seal two. The other Masters continued to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch and activate the prison-suppressing heavenly art to strengthen its power as he fought the ten death gods.</p><p>Ten consecutive punches landed on the ten Grim Reaper’s Sickles, forcing the ten Grim Reapers to retreat. However, Lu Ming’s face was pale.</p><p>“What a strange attack, what a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The death God’s physical attack was not very strong, but it had a strange power that could penetrate the body and attack the spiritual God.</p><p>In other words, it was attacking the soul of the spiritual God.</p><p>Dark child’s attack could penetrate directly into the soul, obliterating the soul of others, killing people invisibly.</p><p>If not for the fact that Lu Ming had consumed the soul-refining fruit and a large number of soul-refining pills, which made his spiritual God extremely condensed and stronger than others, he might not have been able to withstand the attack.</p><p>Even so, Lu Ming’s spiritual God was still trembling and his soul was in excruciating pain.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Dark Child attacked again. At that moment, the sealing door lost its effect. A total of 12 Dark Gods charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Every one of them seemed real.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled five types of concepts and formed a five-colored battle suit on the spiritual God. Then, he fought the death god.</p><p>It was slightly better with the five-colored battle suit protecting the spiritual God, but the spiritual God was still being attacked and was constantly shaking. If this continued, the spiritual God would definitely suffer unimaginable injuries.</p><p>The spiritual God was the foundation of a martial artist. It was where one’s essence, Qi, and spirit were. If it was severely injured, it would have a huge impact on one’s future cultivation.</p><p>it seems like Lu Shaoqing is going to lose. He’s no match for Dark Child!</p><p>it’s said that Dark child’s bloodline Grim Reaper can directly attack one’s soul and kill without a trace. It’s strange, powerful, and impossible to defend against!</p><p>by the way, Lu Shaoqing’s bloodline is so special. It doesn’t have any chakra!</p><p>“I’ve noticed that too. It’s indeed strange. However, there are all kinds of strange things in the world. Perhaps he has cultivated some secret skill to cover his chakra!”</p><p>The crowd discussed as they looked at the platform.</p><p>At this moment, the battle between Lu Ming and dark Child seemed to be a draw. However, those who knew Dark Child knew that in the long run, Lu Ming would definitely be at a disadvantage and would not be able to win.</p><p>On the other side, the heartless monk had already gained the upper hand in the battle between yang potian and the monk.</p><p>“I must win this battle! No matter the price!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>He couldn’t lose this battle. He had to use this opportunity to take Xie nianqing away. He had to win.</p><p>Even if he had to reveal his true identity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
