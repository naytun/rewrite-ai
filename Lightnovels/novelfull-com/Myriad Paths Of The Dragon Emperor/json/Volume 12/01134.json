When the armored men saw the token, they immediately straightened their bodies and showed a respectful expression.</p><p>“So it’s you Sirs, may I know why you’ve come?” One of the armored men asked carefully.</p><p>“Was there a young man who entered earlier?”</p><p>The old man with the token asked.</p><p>“My Lord, are you referring to the exiles? He came in about an hour ago, so he should be somewhere in the city now!”</p><p>The armored man replied respectfully.</p><p>“Somewhere in the city!”</p><p>The four old men nodded and left.</p><p>……</p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, it was the second day.</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the city wall.</p><p>“Those who want to leave the city, hurry up and leave the city!”</p><p>At the city gate, a burly man in battle armor shouted.</p><p>At this moment, the city gate had already opened up to a gap that could only allow one person to pass through.</p><p>From the opening, black mist spread in.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he rushed out of the opening.</p><p>“Is this the abyss demon territory?”</p><p>After rushing out of the city, the light suddenly dimmed.</p><p>The Light between heaven and earth was very dim, and there was a black mist floating between heaven and earth. The entire land was dark.</p><p>He raised his head and saw a sun in the sky. However, the sun was also dark and seemed very oppressive.</p><p>“This place is filled with dense demonic Qi, but there’s no spiritual Qi of heaven and earth here!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed and realized that there was no spiritual energy in this world. Instead, it was filled with thick demonic energy.</p><p>It would be very difficult for ordinary Warriors to cultivate here.</p><p>Because there was no spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, they could only absorb demonic Qi and refine it. However, the difficulty of refining demonic Qi was tens or even hundreds of times more difficult than refining spiritual Qi of heaven and earth.</p><p>However, it did not matter to Lu Ming. He had the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and could devour and refine everything. He could also quickly refine the demonic Qi.</p><p>“Little Qing, where are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the distance. His body moved and he turned into a ray of light that rushed forward.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming disappeared, four elders rushed out of the city behind him. Their expressions changed and they chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming walked forward and sized up the abyss demon territory.</p><p>The demon Realm of the abyss was vast and boundless, with mountains, rivers, and everything. It was said that it was an extremely large mid-plane that automatically evolved into a boundless world.</p><p>There were countless living beings and plants here.</p><p>Most of the plants were black or dark red.</p><p>There were also powerful demonic beasts here. However, these demonic beasts were born from absorbing demonic Qi and were called demonic beasts. They had low intelligence, but they were very powerful.</p><p>Of course, the ruler of the abyss demon territory was the Mosha clan.</p><p>It was said that The Fiend clan was a large clan in the divine wilderness continent long ago. They occupied a large territory, but were later defeated by the human race and escaped to the abyss demon territory. However, they were still very powerful and would often attack the ancient Saint dynasty’s Xie clan. Therefore, the royal family had sent an Army to guard the entrance.</p><p>Moreover, The Fiend clan was extremely cunning. They could fly in the sky and burrow underground in the nine abyss demon territory, so it was very difficult to kill them. Although the royal family and the Xie family would send experts to kill them every once in a while, they could not kill all of them. They were a big threat to the royal family.</p><p>There was also a rumor that the reason why the chaotic heavens divine warrior Xie Luan was able to launch a rebellion and inflict heavy losses on the Royal Xie clan was because he had the help of the devil clan of the demon Realm.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All of a sudden, a black ray of light shot out from a mountain peak below at an astonishing speed, heading straight for Lu Ming.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He stretched out two fingers and flicked them accurately at the dark light, sending it flying.</p><p>“This is the devil clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the creature that attacked him.</p><p>It was a human-shaped living being that was two heads shorter than Lu Ming. This living being was covered in black hair and had a pair of wings on its back. On the wings, there were sharp black bone spikes. It was the same bone spike that had stabbed him just now.</p><p>Furthermore, this living being had a mouth full of fangs and an extremely ferocious appearance, just like the Asuras in the legends.</p><p>This was the mo Sha clan!</p><p>“Human, kill!”</p><p>The Mosha Clansman howled. He held a black bone spur in his hand. He flapped his wings and charged at Lu Ming at top speed. The bone spur in his hand was like a sharp sword.</p><p>This Mo Sha clan was equivalent to a human martial artist of the fifth level of the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and a Spear’s gleam appeared. It flashed and disappeared like a bolt of lightning, flying out and killing The Fiend clan member.</p><p>Then, a Jade card appeared in Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>However, there was no reaction from the Jade token.</p><p>“Eh? Didn’t they say that killing a Mo Sha would give the corresponding points? Why is there no reaction?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his eyebrows slightly.</p><p>Then, he flew closer to the corpse of the mo Sha, but there was still no reaction. No points appeared at all.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s frown deepened.</p><p>“Not good, Lu Ming. There are a few powerful beings flying over at high speed from the distance. They’re coming from the direction of the city you came from!”</p><p>Dandan, who had just arrived in the abyss Demon Realm, crawled out and suddenly shouted.</p><p>“How many powerful existences are there? Could it be that you’re also here to hunt down the mo Sha clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and looked in that direction.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Four rainbow lights streaked across the sky and flew over at an extreme speed, bringing with them a rumbling Sonic Boom.</p><p>When he saw Lu Ming, his eyes suddenly lit up, and a cold killing intent filled the air.</p><p>“There’s killing intent, he’s here to kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he retreated without hesitation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>A black-robed elder roared, his voice shaking the firmament. A silver combat sword was unsheathed from his back. A silver sword light illuminated the dark abyss demon territory, splitting the sky. The terrifying sword Qi instantly crossed the distance of hundreds of miles and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>not good! This is the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>The power of this sword was too terrifying, incomparably terrifying, as if it could destroy everything.</p><p>Furthermore, it was so fast that Lu Ming did not even have the time to perform the blood Meridian fusion. He could only burst out the Seven Rays of dragon energy from the nine Dragons ‘Blood Meridian and fuse them into his body. At the same time, the space between his eyebrows glowed and the small red Pagoda appeared. It expanded rapidly and blocked in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The silver sword gleam slashed at the Red Tower. The terrifying force sent the Red Tower flying and crashed into Lu Ming. Lu Ming and the Red Tower were like two cannonballs, flying backward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming crashed into a mountain peak, breaking the peak of the mountain. His body flew back a few miles before stopping in the air, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming was injured in one move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
