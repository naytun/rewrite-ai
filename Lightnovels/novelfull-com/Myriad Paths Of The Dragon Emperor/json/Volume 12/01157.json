Therefore, with the huge amount of energy that he had devoured, he broke through in one go and entered the fourth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities had increased by a huge margin.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the nine Dragons bloodline and opened his eyes. He saw Xie Luan standing not far away, looking at him in surprise.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons is indeed magical and heaven-defying!</p><p>Xie Luan sighed.</p><p>The reason why he could constantly improve his strength with the help of strong cultivators ‘tonics was that he had already reached his original strength and realm. However, he was still weak after being suppressed for many years and needed the blood essence of strong cultivators to recover.</p><p>He had only recovered, but Lu Ming had improved and broken through. There was no comparison at all.</p><p>“Senior, how much strength have you recovered?”</p><p>Lu Ming changed the topic and asked.</p><p>“With my current strength, I should have no problem fighting a Supreme martial artist!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“He can fight an Autarch?”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of joy.</p><p>The stronger Xie Luan was, the better it would be for him.</p><p>“Senior, do you still want to do something big?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was a little tempted.</p><p>Didn’t the experts from the Overlord forces want to kill him? In that case, he would retaliate. Most importantly, Xie Luan did not seem to be interested in these people’s storage rings, but Lu Ming needed them.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had yet to take stock of the items in the storage rings, they were all experts at the sixth level spiritual God Realm and above. The value of the items in them was definitely shocking. Lu Ming’s heart was burning with excitement.</p><p>haha, your thoughts are the same as mine. I also want to do something big.</p><p>Xie Luan laughed arrogantly.</p><p>“Senior, I’m afraid it’ll be very difficult to kill the enemy with a formation like the previous one. The others will definitely be on guard after seeing the traces left behind by the previous battle. It’ll be very difficult to do it again!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, thinking about how to make a big move.</p><p>“It’s fine. Let’s change our method. Isn’t there a branch of the heavenly martial sword faction nearby? I can sense that there’s something I need in this division!”</p><p>Xie Luan said, a hint of hope in his eyes.</p><p>“Attack the heavenly Sword faction’s division? Senior, I’m afraid that there are Supreme martial artists in this division …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. Although Xie Luan had the ability to fight against a Supreme-being, the Supreme-being of the heavenly Sword sect was in charge of the distribution and controlled the geographical advantage. It was not easy to kill him. If he was not careful, he might end up getting himself killed.</p><p>if I were a bit stronger, I would be confident. There’s something very important to me in that division. If I can get it, I’ll be able to recover my strength quickly. Then I won’t have to hide anymore!</p><p>Xie Luan said, frowning.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment. Suddenly, his palm glowed and a small Pagoda appeared in his palm.</p><p>“An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes glowed when he saw the pagoda.</p><p>“Senior, if I were to lend you this Emperor spiritual weapon for the time being, would you be confident?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, I do. Although this Emperor spiritual weapon doesn’t match my attributes and I can’t fully unleash its power, it’s still an Emperor spiritual weapon. It’s enough to increase my strength by a large margin and attack that division!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll lend it to senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the small tower flew toward Xie Luan.</p><p>If he didn’t make a prompt decision, it would lead to chaos.</p><p>Now that Xie Lun had temporarily attached himself to him, he would definitely not be able to hide many of his secrets from Xie Lun. It would be better to take them out openly and use Xie Lun’s strength to gain some benefits for himself.</p><p>“Hahaha, good, then let’s turn the world upside down!”</p><p>Xie Luan laughed heartily. After refining the small Pagoda for a while, he and Lu Ming left the mountain and river diagram and flew North.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles to the North, in a wild mountain, there was a branch of the heavenly martial sword sect.</p><p>This was what Xie Luan had sensed when Lu Ming and the rest had passed by.</p><p>Soon, a sword peak that reached the sky appeared in front of him.</p><p>The mountain peak was like a sword that seemed to be able to reach the sky. From a distance, one could feel the powerful sword power spreading out.</p><p>There seemed to be a demonic light flickering in Xie Luan’s eyes, as if he could see through everything.</p><p>the tianwu sword faction’s distribution is not simple. They seem to be secretly studying something related to ‘demons’!</p><p>Xie Luan muttered.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The tianwu sword sect was actually researching something related to ‘demons’. That was why Xie Luan had chosen this place.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With Lu Ming in tow, Xie Luan took a step forward and appeared in the sky above the heavenly Sword edge.</p><p>“Who is it? This is the heavenly Sword faction’s assignment. Unrelated people, get lost!”</p><p>As soon as they appeared, the experts on the heaven-connecting sword peak sensed them and let out a loud shout with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Xie Luan said coldly. A small red Pagoda appeared in his hand and rapidly enlarged until it finally turned into a giant Pagoda that reached the sky. It was comparable to the sword blade that reached the sky. A scorching aura emanated from it, and a light shield-like object emerged from it. It was Scarlet in color and exuded an astonishing temperature.</p><p>“Is this a domain?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with amazement.</p><p>An Emperor’s intent would evolve into a domain, and an Emperor spiritual weapon would also contain a domain, which was extremely terrifying.</p><p>fire domain! Not good! It’s an Emperor! An Emperor is attacking!</p><p>“Activate the formation, activate the formation!”</p><p>As soon as the king spiritual weapon was taken out, the heaven-connecting sword was in chaos and screams of fear could be heard.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xie Luan’s abundant genuine vitality poured into the fiery Pagoda, which pressed down on the heavenly Sword.</p><p>At this moment, countless inscriptions appeared around the heaven-reaching sword blade, forming a large formation. A beam of sword Qi shot up and blasted toward the small red Tower.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With an earth-shattering explosion, the sword Qi was destroyed. The giant tower suppressed everything and smashed hard on the mountain-protecting formation of the heavenly Sword peak.</p><p>The great mountain-protecting formation shook violently and almost collapsed.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Xie Luan bellowed as he continued to control the pagoda.</p><p>This time, with a deafening boom, the protective formation of the heavenly Sword peak was broken.</p><p>The formation was broken and the giant tower hit the peak. The entire sword peak shook violently and then exploded.</p><p>At this moment, the sword peak was filled with screams. Countless disciples of the sky martial sword faction screamed as they were turned into ashes by the terrifying energy.</p><p>Even some powerful high-level spiritual gods spat out mouthfuls of blood and were severely injured.</p><p>“Who are you? The heavenly martial sword faction will definitely kill you!”</p><p>An angry roar was heard, and a bright sword light shot up from the bottom of the sword peak, as if it was going to split the world in half.</p><p>A Supreme, this was a Supreme.</p><p>“The person who will kill you!”</p><p>Demonic Qi rolled around Xie Luan like a peerless demonic god. He controlled the Emperor spiritual weapon to suppress his opponent.</p><p>At the same time, Xie Luan strode forward. His muscles bulged, and a demonic light that seemed to contain infinite power emerged.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>He threw a punch, and the space was smashed into pieces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
