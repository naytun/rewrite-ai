Above his head, the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection was rotating slowly, emitting a wonderful fluctuation.</p><p>...</p><p>Xie Luan was floating beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“It’s almost time!”</p><p>seal! Xie Luan suddenly shouted. He kept forming seals with both hands and four sealing doors appeared, sealing the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument. Then, he charged into the Grand Canyon and dug a big hole with his spear. Lu Ming rushed dozens of miles underground and spread his spiritual senses.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One figure after another appeared, floating around the great canyon, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p>The weakest of them was at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, while the strongest had an earth-shattering aura. They were extremely terrifying and were shockingly experts at the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>They were all dressed differently. Some wore white swordsman robes, most of whom were experts from the heavenly martial Sword School, while others wore blood-red robes, experts from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan and found that the heavenly Sword faction, cold-blood Hall, and the Royal Xie family had the most experts.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the heaven’s secrets apparatus’s projection disappear again? is this heaven’s secrets apparatus’s projection of any use?”</p><p>damn it, the disk array clearly showed that it was nearby. Why did it suddenly disappear? ”</p><p>“Lu Ming must be nearby and hiding somewhere. Let’s surround this area and see how long he can hide.”</p><p>One by one, the experts shouted out. Their figures flashed and they surrounded the area.</p><p>“With so many experts here, how much wealth would there be in their interspatial rings?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes shone with a fiery glow.</p><p>Xie Luan also spread out his spiritual sense to sense the surroundings.</p><p>four great circle spiritual gods, nine ninth level spiritual gods, and no Supremes. That’s enough, that’s enough. With these tonics, I’m confident that I can fight against Supremes!</p><p>Xie Luan murmured, his eyes cold.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m going to release a trace of the seal now!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Then, Xie Luan performed a hand seal and unlocked the door of seal a little.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Immediately, some fluctuations of the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection were emitted.</p><p>At this moment, the array disks in the hands of the experts near the great canyon moved. They reacted and all pointed in one direction, the great canyon.</p><p>he’s appeared. Lu Ming has appeared. He’s in that huge Canyon!</p><p>“He should be hiding in the underground of the great canyon, using a secret technique to conceal the fluctuations of the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection. Now, he finally can’t hide anymore and is about to be revealed!”</p><p>“Kill him! Lu Ming is mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>charge! the experts roared and burst out with powerful auras. Their eyes were red as they charged towards the canyon.</p><p>If he killed Lu Ming, he would be able to obtain a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure. The temptation was too great.</p><p>At least dozens of experts at the sixth level spiritual God Realm and above rushed into the large Canyon. At the same time, attacks burst out and blasted toward the ground, trying to force Lu Ming out of the ground.</p><p>“All of you, die!”</p><p>Underground, Xie Luan’s eyes were cold. With a wave of his hands, countless inscriptions glowed in the valley, and a peerless killing formation appeared, filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Streaks of terrifying sword Qi appeared and destroyed the attacks of these experts. The terrifying aura of the formation made everyone’s heart turn cold and their souls tremble.</p><p>not good, it’s a peerless killing formation. We’ve been tricked!</p><p>“Retreat, retreat, retreat!”</p><p>These experts went crazy as they frantically tried to escape.</p><p>However, it was too late.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The terrifying sword Qi was killing at a speed that was faster than the naked eye could see.</p><p>Screams rang out. Those experts below the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm were killed in an instant, and their blood and Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>Even the nine experts in the ninth level of the spiritual God Realm could not resist for a few breaths before they were killed one by one.</p><p>In the end, there were only four great circle spiritual God stage experts left.</p><p>let’s work together! Let’s work together and charge out!</p><p>we’ve been tricked. Lu Ming has the help of an expert. We’ve been deceived. We’ve been deceived by the imperial family!</p><p>With furious roars, the four great circle spiritual God stage experts wanted to join forces and charge out.</p><p>However, this great formation had been greatly improved and its power was too great. The four great circle spiritual God stage experts tried their best to break through, but to their despair, they found that they were unable to break out.</p><p>The four of them didn’t last long before their defenses were broken by the sharp sword Qi. Ten thousand swords pierced through their hearts and they died on the spot.</p><p>Dozens of experts at the sixth level spiritual God Realm and above were completely annihilated.</p><p>It was especially so for those powers that had fallen in the great circle of the spiritual God stage. It would definitely be a huge loss.</p><p>The great circle of the spiritual God Realm was second only to the Supremes. There would not be many great circle spiritual gods in any faction. The death of one would be a great loss.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming dashed toward the ground and reached the ground in an instant.</p><p>As soon as he reached the ground, Xie Luan transformed into a ball of demonic Qi and enveloped the expert’s corpse.</p><p>“Senior, please leave a few for me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He was envious to see so many spiritual God powerhouses, especially the few who had cultivated the earth concept.</p><p>Lu Ming dashed toward the few experts who had cultivated the earth concept.</p><p>Xie Luan had intentionally allowed Lu Ming to benefit from this. He did not touch the few people that Lu Ming had his eyes on, while the rest were shrouded in demonic Qi and became Xie Luan’s nourishment.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodline and rushed to the front of an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert. He opened his mouth and inhaled, and devouring power burst forth, devouring the expert’s vital essence, blood essence, and runes.</p><p>Immediately after, Lu Ming rushed to another one and continued to devour.</p><p>Lu Ming had devoured three experts in the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, all of whom were experts who cultivated the earth concept.</p><p>After devouring the three masters, the nine Dragon bloodlines swelled up and were filled with boundless and terrifying energy.</p><p>Xie Luan did not collect the experts ‘storage rings. They all flew toward Lu Ming and were put away.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning. There were so many powerful people. How much wealth would they have?</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s go. We have to leave this place first!”</p><p>Demonic Qi surged around Xie Luan as he wrapped Lu Ming in it and flew into the distance.</p><p>The commotion here would soon be known by others, and they would definitely attract powerful experts.</p><p>Xie Luan carried Lu Ming and traveled a thousand miles in an instant. Before long, they had traveled millions of miles. Lu Ming rushed into the belly of a huge mountain and entered the mountain and river diagram. He sat cross-legged and began to refine the energy that he had just devoured.</p><p>The energy of three eighth level spiritual gods was too vast and boundless. It was constantly transformed into true essence and Lu Ming’s cultivation began to improve rapidly.</p><p>Middle-stage third level spiritual God Realm, late-stage third level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>The intent runes were also being refined continuously. Before long, Lu Ming’s earth intent had successfully broken through the bottleneck and entered the lower tier of level four. It was still slowly improving.</p><p>Moreover, some of them had comprehended the concept of fire. This allowed Lu Ming’s concept of fire to improve.</p><p>As for the blood essence of the three experts, Lu Ming used all of them to upgrade the prison suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Not long after, the eighth golden chakra emerged on the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline. It was a little dim at first, but it gradually became bright.</p><p>After a few hours, Lu Ming finally finished refining the energy and blood essence of the three eighth level spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body rippled with a powerful aura. It was several times stronger than before.</p><p>Fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
