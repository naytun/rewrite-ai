Now that their emperors had fallen, they naturally became popular in the eyes of the other forces.</p><p>By now, these two Overlord forces had already been destroyed.</p><p>Out of the eighteen Overlord forces of the central continent, only sixteen remained.</p><p>How cruel was it for an Overlord force to be destroyed just like that?</p><p>“How are the forces around the chaotic realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>Mo Ye answered honestly, ” cold-blood Hall and the floating mountain sect are the closest to the chaotic realm. After the death of the Eagle King, cold-blood Hall was the first to react. They immediately sent an Army to attack the sky Eagle Castle and divided most of the territory. Some of the experts in the sky Eagle Castle also surrendered to cold-blood Hall, which greatly improved their strength. Now, cold-blood Hall is fighting with the floating mountain sect. It seems that cold-blood Hall has even attacked the headquarters of the floating mountain sect!</p><p>“Cold-blood Hall!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall had always held a grudge against him.</p><p>“How are the other territories? Did they fight?”</p><p>Xie Luan asked.</p><p>Northern Plains has gone to battle, when the various emperors were fighting for the Heavenly King token, Northern Plains ’emperors participated, but now, Northern Plains seems to be in an internal war, the various forces in Northern Plains are fighting each other, they did not interfere in central continent’s matters!</p><p>however, the Western Desert, the southern underworld, and the eastern barren territory have not participated in the battle, and no Emperor has tried to snatch the Heavenly King token!</p><p>Mo Ye replied.</p><p>“Neither the southern nether nor the eastern barren territory have participated in the battle?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan were a little surprised.</p><p>It was still acceptable that Western Desert did not fight.</p><p>Because Western Desert’s history was very long, there were rumors that Western Desert had a huge background and seemed to be related to the ocean.</p><p>However, it was strange that neither the southern nether nor the eastern barren territory had sent out any emperors.</p><p>This was especially true for the emperors of the underworld of the southern underworld. They were all extremely powerful, sinister, bloodthirsty, and greedy.</p><p>In the face of the Heavenly King’s token, he was actually indifferent?</p><p>The Emperor of the East continent didn’t participate?</p><p>This was very abnormal.</p><p>“Senior, what should we do now?”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming asked Xie Luan.</p><p>to Northern Plains, haha, I might as well tell you, I have a backup plan in Northern Plains, the Overlord force of Northern Plains, Demon God Valley, is one of them. We will first go to Northern Plains and unify all the forces there, then we will sit on the mountain and watch the Tigers fight, we will make plans after seeing the situation in central continent!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. The other party was indeed the chaotic heavens divine warrior. He caused the ancient sacred dynasty, which was at its peak, to fall apart. He was truly unfathomable. Even if he was suppressed, he had left behind a series of backup plans.</p><p>“But to go to Northern Plains, we need to use the Overlord forces ‘inter-territory teleportation formation. Now that there is a war, who would want to use our inter-territory teleportation formation? We have to destroy one of the Overlord forces to use their inter-territory teleportation formation!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke. He could tell what the problem was.</p><p>haha, that’s right. So, we have to destroy one of the two forces, cold-blood Hall and the floating mountain. Lu Ming, which one do you think we should destroy? ”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>let’s destroy cold-blood Hall. I have a history with the floating mountain sect. Maybe we can form an alliance!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, let’s destroy cold-blood Hall. Mo Ye, assemble the army and set off immediately!</p><p>Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>……</p><p>Mo Ye and the rest went to gather the Army while Lu Ming strolled in the air and arrived in front of a tall, ancient Hall.</p><p>This ancient palace was the demonic Palace, where Xie nianqing was in seclusion.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming’s arrival, Xie nianqing appeared at the entrance of the ancient Hall.</p><p>“Xiao Qing, let’s go. I’ll take you back to the East continent!” He said.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing’s hand.</p><p>Lu Ming had another purpose for this battle.</p><p>If cold-blood Hall was destroyed, Lu Ming could use the cross-territory teleportation formation to connect with the talisman Amulet sect. In that case, the talisman Amulet sect could use the cross-territory teleportation formation to teleport people directly to cold-blood Hall. In that case, the talisman Amulet sect would be able to solve their problems.</p><p>Even if Di Yi broke through the yin and yang formation, he would not be afraid.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming also wanted to see if he could use the power of Xie Lun and Mo Ye, the two demon emperors, to get rid of Di Yi.</p><p>If he could get rid of Di Yi, he would be able to get rid of all future troubles.</p><p>“Lu Ming, has Xie Luan recovered?”</p><p>Xie nianqing asked, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>Obviously, Xie nianqing didn’t trust Xie Luan either. Xie Luan was a demon Emperor who had caused chaos in the world. If he fully recovered and got rid of the shackles of the prison-suppressing stele, who knew what he would do?</p><p>Xie nianqing was also a little worried.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Xie Luan and I have already formed an alliance!”</p><p>Lu Ming then told him about the Alliance between Xie Luan and him.</p><p>After hearing this, Xie nianqing was relieved.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The iron hooves stomped in the air. The void in the myriad demons abyss trembled, and demonic Qi soared into the sky.</p><p>An Army of over 100000 soldiers, clad in battle armor and riding on powerful magical beasts, leaped in the sky, causing the air to tremble.</p><p>The Army of 100000 was made up of elites above the spiritual ocean tier.</p><p>This was already equivalent to the Army of an Overlord force.</p><p>The Army of the Overlord forces had the spirit ocean as the soldier, the spirit embryo as the stem, and the spirit God as the general. They could destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p>100,000 people, riding on magical beasts, gathered in the sky above the city.</p><p>At the forefront, Lu Ming and Xie Luan stood side by side. A little behind them were Xie nianqing, Mo Ye, and a dozen other Supreme martial artists.</p><p>this battle is our first battle. After this battle, we will walk out of the myriad demons abyss and make a name for ourselves in the vast divine wilderness mainland. Do you have the confidence? ”</p><p>Xie Luan’s voice came from the distance.</p><p>“There are!”</p><p>The Army of 100000 roared, their momentum shaking the heavens.</p><p>alright, our target is the Overlord force, cold-blood Hall. We’ve received news that the main force of cold-blood Hall is currently besieging the floating mountain and fighting there. We’ll split into two groups. One group will be led by Lu Ming to besiege and kill the cold-blood Hall Army that is attacking the floating mountain with Mo Ye as support. The other group will follow me to attack the headquarters of cold-blood Hall. Let’s go!</p><p>After Xie Luan’s announcement, the Army set out.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Lu Ming led the main military force and set off first, heading straight for the floating mountain.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A total of 80000 soldiers rode demonic beasts and followed Lu Ming out of the myriad demons abyss, flying toward the floating mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming was riding on a perfected spiritual God demonic beast and flying at the front. As he looked at the Army behind him, his eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that this Army did not belong to him. It belonged to Xie Luan. He was still weak now, but Lu Ming was confident that he would be able to dominate the divine wilderness continent soon. He would have his own invincible army and conquer the world.</p><p>“This day won’t be too long!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with confidence.</p><p>Once they were out of the chaotic domain, Mo Ye took out a huge warship. The 80000 soldiers boarded the warship. Mo Ye controlled the warship and flew towards the floating mountain.</p><p>Of course, they couldn’t fly to the floating mountain, as it was too far. Many sea of soul realm Warriors would need to fly for a long time, but with Mo Ye’s warship, it would be many times faster.</p><p>This kind of warship was originally refined to be used in a great battle. Sometimes, when the teleportation formation could not operate, the warship was used to transport troops.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
