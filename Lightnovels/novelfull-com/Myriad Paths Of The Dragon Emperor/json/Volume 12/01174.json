Almost all the experts from cold-blood Hall had surrendered. A few Supreme-beings had escaped, while the rest had surrendered.</p><p>Even the Emperor had fled in defeat. If they put up a last-ditch resistance, they would still be courting death!</p><p>The great battle ended just like that.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming instructed the powerhouses to work with the floating mountain to inscribe an array in the consciousness of the people who surrendered.</p><p>“Brother Lu, we meet again!”</p><p>The pure and ethereal spirit came over gracefully, her grace peerless. Her entire body was covered in mist, ethereal like an immortal.</p><p>“Miss Kong Ling!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>Jing kongling’s eyes fell on Xie nianqing and he said, ” this must be miss Xie nianqing. She’s so beautiful that brother Lu is willing to go to the demon Realm in person!</p><p>Xie nianqing’s eyes darted around as he held onto Lu Ming’s arm. “Miss is too polite!”</p><p>Then, a voice was transmitted into Lu Ming’s ears. “While I’m not here, you know quite a lot of beautiful women, huh? I was wondering why you attacked cold-blood Hall instead of the floating mountain. There’s a beauty here waiting for you to save her!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. Could this girl be jealous?</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind was spinning rapidly. He was trying to find a reason to explain.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the space cracked open, and Mo Ye and the moon Heart Martial Emperor walked out of it.</p><p>“Mo Ye, how’s the blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked hurriedly.</p><p>“That fellow’s body was shattered, and his spiritual God was also severely injured by us. Unfortunately, he still managed to escape with his heavily injured spiritual God!”</p><p>Mo Ye explained with some pity.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed to himself. The blood Emperor was indeed powerful and difficult to kill. He managed to escape despite the combined attacks of two martial emperors of the same level.</p><p>however, although he has escaped, he won’t be able to cause any trouble in a short period of time. His spiritual God is heavily injured and he has escaped with all his might. He doesn’t have much strength left!</p><p>Mo Ye explained.</p><p>“This time, many thanks for brother Mo Ye’s help!”</p><p>At this moment, Martial Emperor Yuexin spoke and cupped her hands towards Mo Ye.</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin was very beautiful. She looked to be in her thirties and didn’t look like an Emperor path expert who had been famous in the central continent for nearly 10000 years.</p><p>haha, there’s no need to thank me. I’m only following orders. If you want to thank someone, you should thank commander Lu Ming!</p><p>Mo Ye smiled and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Mo Ye actually listened to Lu Ming’s orders?</p><p>An Emperor actually took orders from a young junior. This was truly rare in the world.</p><p>“Greetings, senior Yuexin!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Martial Emperor Yuexin.</p><p>you’re too kind, Commander-in-Chief Lu. Shall we go into the mountains for a chat? ”</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin said.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others nodded and followed Martial Emperor Yuexin, Jing kongling, and the others into the floating mountain. They sat down in a Hall.</p><p>this time, thank you, commander Lu, for leading the Army to help us. Otherwise, the floating mountain would have been in danger!</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin thanked Lu Ming again.</p><p>“Martial Emperor is too polite. I am old friends with miss Kong Ling of the floating mountain martial school and brother Chu Kuang. It is only right for me to lend a hand!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said, ” the central continent is in chaos now. All the major forces are fighting each other. If we are separated, we will be weak. If we join forces, we will be strong. Lu Ming wants to form an alliance with the floating mountain sect. What do you think, Martial Emperor? ”</p><p>“Alliance?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin, Jing kongling, and the other Supreme figures of the floating mountain sect were all stunned and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin pondered for a moment and said, ” “I wonder if senior Xie Luan is here?”</p><p>senior Xie is at the headquarters of cold-blood Hall. I’m afraid the hall has already fallen into your hands!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>the two sides have formed an alliance. Commander Lu, can you represent senior Xie? ”</p><p>Martial Emperor Yuexin said.</p><p>Obviously, Lu Ming was not important enough in Martial Emperor Yuexin’s eyes.</p><p>“Don’t worry, commander Lu can make the decision on behalf of the ancestor devil!”</p><p>From the side, Mo Ye spoke.</p><p>This shocked Martial Emperor Yue Xin, Jing kongling, and the others.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to have such great power in Xie Luan’s faction.</p><p>Yuexin’s eyes flickered slightly. All the rumors about Lu Ming that she had heard kept flashing through her mind.</p><p>“This kid has a bright future!”</p><p>In the end, Yue Xin’s eyes lit up, and she said, ” “Good, since that’s the case, the floating mountain martial school will form an alliance with commander Lu!”</p><p>She was talking about commander Lu, not the Emperor of chaos.</p><p>“Alright. Lu Ming, thank you, senior Yue!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>To Lu Ming, it was greatly beneficial to have another ally.</p><p>At that moment, the two sides carried out a simple ceremony and officially formed an alliance.</p><p>After the Alliance, Lu Ming bade farewell to Yuexin and the others because Xie Luan had sent news that the cold-blood Hall’s base was completely under control.</p><p>Lu Ming led the Army and headed straight for cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall had been completely occupied. Those who had stayed behind had either surrendered or been killed.</p><p>There were experts from the myriad demons abyss everywhere in the cold-blood Hall. Many of them were inscribing formations or repairing them.</p><p>It did not take long for Lu Ming and the rest to arrive at cold-blood Hall.</p><p>At the cross-territory teleportation formation in cold-blood Hall, more than a dozen experts gathered.</p><p>Xie Luan, Lu Ming, Mo Ye, and the others were among them.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I didn’t expect you to be the zongzi of the talisman Amulet sect in the eastern wilderness. It’s strange that you don’t have any mental energy fire at all!”</p><p>Xie Luan laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>“Seniors, please help me adjust the coordinates of the talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>A few Supreme martial artists who were more skilled in the Dao of inscription stepped forward and adjusted the coordinates of the talisman Amulet sect on the huge inter-territory teleportation altar.</p><p>Lu Ming closed his eyes.</p><p>At that moment, in the talisman Amulet sect, a cave abode that had been closed for a long time suddenly opened. Lu Ming’s Ming Lian clone stepped out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body moved and he headed toward Bai Shijin’s mansion.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and two other Supreme elders appeared at the cross-territory teleportation formation of the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>“The chaotic heavens divine warrior, Xie Luan, has actually reappeared?”</p><p>you even formed an alliance to destroy the Overlord cold-blood Hall? ”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest mumbled to themselves. Ever since Lu Ming’s second clone had briefly explained the situation in the central continent, they were still in disbelief and had not recovered from the shock.</p><p>senior, everything is real now. Let’s adjust the coordinates of cold-blood Hall and accept the teleportation request!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>good, good, haha, this way, Di Yi can’t trap us!</p><p>Bai Shijin laughed.</p><p>The others also smiled.</p><p>If they could connect with the Overlord forces of central continent, they would no longer have to be afraid of Di Yi’s siege. Even if the yin and yang formation was broken, they would have a way out.</p><p>They immediately began to adjust their coordinates.</p><p>The teleportation formation could only be used with the consent of both parties. It could not be used just because one party wanted to.</p><p>Otherwise, if one of them were to suddenly teleport to another force, wouldn’t they be able to break through from the inside? Naturally, that was impossible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
