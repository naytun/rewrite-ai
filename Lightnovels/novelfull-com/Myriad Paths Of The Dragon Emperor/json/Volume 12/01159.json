He felt his eardrums rumble and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Big words, kill!”</p><p>The Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School was very powerful. As he took a step forward, it was as if his entire body had turned into a combat sword. Endless sword Qi swam around his body.</p><p>I killed more than one ordinary sword body back then!</p><p>As Xie Luan’s voice rang out, the giant Pagoda trembled and flew out, suppressing the other party.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His opponent swung his sword, and the whole world was split open. A terrifying sword light slashed on the giant tower. The power exploded, breaking the flame domain of the giant tower and blocking it.</p><p>At the same time, several terrifying sword Qi shot toward Xie Luan.</p><p>“Domain of sword, Hmph!”</p><p>Hmph! Xie Luan snorted coldly. He withdrew his boundless demonic Qi and revealed his true form. His body glowed with demonic light, as if it contained boundless power.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>He threw out a few consecutive punches, which collided with the sword Qi of the other party. A violent boom rang out, and the ground was directly cut a hundred miles deep by the sweeping energy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword Qi was destroyed, but Xie Luan’s body also took a step back. He stomped on the space, and it exploded, revealing a pitch-black space.</p><p>Xie Luan seemed to be at a slight disadvantage.</p><p>But at this moment, the other party did not continue to attack. Instead, he widened his eyes and stared at Xie Luan.</p><p>“You … You are … Xie Luan?”</p><p>The Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School said with great difficulty. He was filled with disbelief.</p><p>In the past, Xie Luan had rebelled against the imperial family and launched a shocking war with the imperial family, the Xie clan. Many forces had participated in that war and witnessed Xie Luan’s Supreme demonic power.</p><p>There were portraits of Xie Lun in many of the Overlord forces, and many of those portraits had been drawn by emperors. One could even sense Xie Lun’s demonic might and aura from the portraits.</p><p>There was such a portrait in the heavenly martial sword sect. The Emperor of the heavenly martial sword sect had personally experienced it before, and it was exactly the same as Xie Luan.</p><p>Therefore, he was immediately stunned, shocked, and in disbelief.</p><p>How could the Supreme demon Emperor from 30000 years ago appear now?</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Xie Luan did not linger in the battle. Instead, he tore open the space and stepped into the spatial Rift with Lu Ming, disappearing from the place.</p><p>Only the Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School was left at the scene.</p><p>“Xie Luan, it’s definitely Xie Luan. With Xie Luan’s appearance, the world is going to be in chaos again!”</p><p>The Emperor of the heavenly martial Sword School muttered to himself.</p><p>After a while, his eyes glowed as he muttered to himself, ” that’s good. This is an opportunity, perhaps an opportunity for our heavenly martial sword sect. It’s just a pity for that demon fetus!</p><p>The Martial Emperor of the heavenly martial sword sect sighed. Then, he suddenly looked in one direction, and two bright sword lights shot out of his eyes. He scolded, ” “Who is it?”</p><p>“Haha, wujue sword Emperor, how are you?”</p><p>A loud laugh was heard. A bolt of lightning flashed in the sky, and a middle-aged man wearing a Blue Thunder battle robe appeared in the air.</p><p>“Thunder Blade Emperor, why are you here?”</p><p>Sword Emperor wujue frowned.</p><p>The Thunder saber Emperor was the sect master of the sky Thunder saber sect, an Overlord force, and an Emperor.</p><p>“The royal family’s Xie family has spread the news to the world and activated the heaven’s secrets instrument in order to capture Lu Ming. However, I have a feeling that it’s not that simple. I just happened to come out of seclusion, so I came out for a walk. I sensed a strong fluctuation here, so I rushed over to take a look.”</p><p>The Thunder saber Emperor explained. He looked around and said, ” “Wujue, this should be one of your Heavenly Sword faction’s branches, right? it seems that the branch has been destroyed. You were the one fighting with the other party just now, right? Where was he? Why? Even you can’t make him stay?”</p><p>“They’ve already left!”</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor said.</p><p>“Who is it? The remaining demonic Qi here is extremely shocking. Could it be the demon Emperor of the demon mountain?”</p><p>The Thunder Blade Emperor’s eyes flashed as he asked tentatively.</p><p>Martial Emperor wujue pondered for a while and said, ” “It’s not the demon Emperor from demon mountain. You won’t be able to guess who this person is even in your dreams!”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>The Thunder saber Emperor asked curiously when he saw Martial Emperor wujue’s serious face.</p><p>“Xie Luan, sovereign of chaotic heavens, Xie Luan!”</p><p>Wu Jue and Wu Huang said each word clearly.</p><p>“What … What?”</p><p>Even with the Thunder saber Emperor’s mental fortitude, he was still stunned at this moment. He was dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>“Wujue, are you seeing things or are you just joking with me? Xie Luan, the Xie Luan of thirty thousand years, how could he still be alive?”</p><p>The Thunder Blade Emperor said in disbelief.</p><p>“Do I look like I’m joking?”</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor said coldly.</p><p>The Thunder saber Emperor fell silent. His eyes flickered as if he was thinking about something. After a while, he said, ” if it’s really Xie Luan, I’m afraid the imperial family will be in chaos. I know why the imperial family activated the heaven’s secrets instrument. Their target is not Lu Ming, but Xie Luan!</p><p>“That’s most likely the case. Moreover, Xie Luan hasn’t recovered to his peak state yet. He’s not even my match!”</p><p>Wu Jue and Wu Huang said.</p><p>“If that’s the case, do you have any way to track Xie Luan’s Qi? we’ll follow him and see what he’s going to do next.”</p><p>The Thunder Martial Emperor said.</p><p>“Xie Luan used a disciple of the heavenly martial sword sect as a tonic to recover his demonic body. His presence hasn’t been completely eliminated yet, so I can use a secret technique to pursue him. That’s good. I’ll go and see what Xie Luan is up to.”</p><p>Sword Emperor wujue said. He began to use a secret technique to capture Xie Luan’s aura.</p><p>Xie Luan brought Lu Ming across the space several times before stopping.</p><p>I still haven’t recovered to the Emperor realm. I’m still a little weaker than that kid!</p><p>Xie Luan said. that kid, ” he was referring to sword Emperor wujue.</p><p>“Senior is still not a match for the Emperor?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I can barely fight. Ordinary emperors can’t do anything to me. With your Emperor spiritual weapon, I can fight ordinary emperors. However, if we fight for a long time, it’ll be disadvantageous to me. Now that my identity has been exposed, I’m afraid that all the emperors in the world will find ways to find us. It’ll be very disadvantageous for us next!</p><p>Xie Luan said. Although he said this, a cold smile still hung on his face.</p><p>“Senior, do you have any good moves?”</p><p>Seeing Xie Luan’s expression, Lu Ming knew that Xie Luan had an idea.</p><p>“Didn’t the royal family use all their strength to hunt us down? Then I’ll make sure the royal family doesn’t have the mind to hunt us down. In fact, I’ll make the divine wilderness continent fall into chaos and attack each other. This way, I’ll have time to recover.”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Cause the divine wilderness continent to descend into chaos? Attacking each other?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked, but he was also full of doubts. What method did Xie Luan have to cause the world to be in chaos and attack each other?</p><p>I have a Heavenly King’s token with me. It once belonged to the royal family. Hehe, as long as I take out this Heavenly King’s token, it’s enough to make those Royal Warriors go crazy. Lu Ming, let’s go to the holy city. The show is about to start!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed and tore open space with Lu Ming, heading for the holy city.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
