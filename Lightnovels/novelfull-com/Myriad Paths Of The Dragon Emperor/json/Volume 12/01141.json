There were even experts from the Overlord forces among them.</p><p>They might not know each other in the outside world, but they were very United in the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>If they didn’t work together in the abyss demon territory, they would eventually be defeated by The Fiend clan and buried here.</p><p>Similarly, the imperial family had set points for them. As long as they could complete it, they would be let out. However, the height of the points made people despair.</p><p>However, they were all experts of the spiritual God Realm and could live for 5000 years. They were not willing to be locked up in the abyss demon territory for the rest of their lives. Therefore, they held onto the hope that they could accumulate enough points and leave this place.</p><p>Therefore, they would constantly hunt down the devil clan, and in turn, the devil clan would kill them. That was why the devil clan had attacked the city today.</p><p>In reality, it was common for The Fiend clan to attack cities. However, The Fiend clan that had come today was slightly stronger, and there were a lot more of them.</p><p>“Little brother Lu, let’s have a chat in the castle!”</p><p>Du Shan invited.</p><p>“No need, but I do have a question that I would like to consult with all the seniors!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“What question? There’s no harm in just saying it!”</p><p>“As long as I know, I’ll definitely tell you!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>“Dear Seniors, have you seen the sixteenth Princess?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“The sixteenth Princess, are you talking about the sixteenth Princess who has the bloodline of the royal family? I’ve not seen her, but I’ve heard that she’s in the demon Realm of Tartarus!”</p><p>Du Shan pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>Many others also shook their heads.</p><p>“I’ve met Princess sixteen once!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he heard the voice. It was the white-haired old woman.</p><p>“Senior, when was it? Where have you seen it before?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked anxiously.</p><p>about a few months ago, about a few million miles away from here. I talked to the sixteenth Princess and she said she wanted to go to the devil tablet mountain!</p><p>The old woman replied.</p><p>“What? The devil tablet mountain!”</p><p>The others all gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart tightened and he said,”the devil tablet mountain?” Is it very dangerous?”</p><p>it is indeed dangerous, brother Lu. The devil tablet mountain is a forbidden area in the nine Serenities devil domain. Many powerful devil clan members have entered it, but they all died there. Humans are no exception. There’s no exit!</p><p>Du Shan sighed.</p><p>“There’s no exit?”</p><p>Lu Ming started to feel anxious. Why would Xie nianqing go to such a dangerous place?</p><p>“Seniors, do you have a map to the devil tablet mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Brother Lu, you want to go to the devil tablet mountain? It’s really dangerous there. Although the inside of the devil tablet mountain is extremely dangerous, there are many powerful Mo Sha clan members around the mountain. They cultivate in the outer area of the mountain and hope to get some opportunities. Therefore, the outer area of the mountain is also very dangerous. Little brother, you must be careful!”</p><p>The white-haired old woman persuaded.</p><p>“Thank you, seniors, but Lu Ming must go to the devil tablet mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s tone was firm. Now that he knew of Xie nianqing’s whereabouts and that he might even be in danger, he had to go even if it meant going through mountains of daggers and seas of flames.</p><p>Seeing Lu Ming’s firm attitude, du Shan, the white-haired old ou, and the rest heaved a long sigh and did not try to persuade him anymore.</p><p>In the end, the white-haired old ou took out a map and gave it to Lu Ming. The map was very rough, but it roughly depicted the terrain and location of some parts of the abyss demon territory.</p><p>On it was the general route of the nine nether demon tablet mountain.</p><p>“Thank you, senior. Lu Ming will take his leave!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the map and bade everyone farewell. He did not want to delay any further.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light, passing through the night sky and heading in the direction of the devil tablet mountain at top speed.</p><p>On the way, Lu Ming cast the illusionary breath technique and darkened his aura, making it somewhat similar to the aura of the Mosha clan. Indeed, it saved him a lot of trouble along the way. The number of Mosha clan members who attacked him was greatly reduced.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast. He was hurrying along.</p><p>A few months ago, Xie nianqing went to the devil tablet mountain. He should have been there by now. The devil tablet mountain was so dangerous. How was Xie nianqing doing?</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart was burning with anxiety. He could not wait to rush to Xie nianqing’s side.</p><p>The devil’s tablet mountain was in the depths of the abyss demon territory. It was very far from the castle where du Shan and the rest were. At Lu Ming’s speed, it took him five days to reach the area where the devil’s tablet mountain was.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming stood high in the sky and looked into the distance. He was a little shocked.</p><p>This area was filled with mountains.</p><p>There were all sorts of strange plants growing in the mountain range.</p><p>However, there was a mountain peak that stood out among the mountains. It could be seen at a glance even from a great distance.</p><p>It was because the mountain peak was too majestic. It was like a group of cranes standing among the mountains. It was high up in the sky, and no one knew how high it was.</p><p>The mountain was shrouded in black mist, and it was impossible to see the specific situation of the mountain peak.</p><p>“Is that the devil tablet mountain?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart, his eyes filled with shock and doubt.</p><p>Ever since he got close to this place, he felt that the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele in his body was emitting a hot aura, as if it was about to appear from his spine.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the devil tablet mountain cause the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline to change?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not understand.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming flew toward the huge mountain that was filled with black mist.</p><p>As they got closer, they could feel the magnificence and magnificence of the giant mountain even more. The other peaks were also considered majestic and tall, but when compared to this peak, they were far inferior.</p><p>The change in the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline also became more intense.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt a strong fluctuation in front of him. It was not just one but several.</p><p>Each of them contained a powerful demonic might, and there were experts from the mo Sha clan.</p><p>Lu Ming restrained his aura to the extreme and flew forward.</p><p>“That human girl has obtained a treasure in the devil tablet mountain. We can not let that treasure fall into the hands of the human race. Let’s attack together and kill her!”</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go together. That human girl has been surrounded and can’t escape. She must die today!”</p><p>“The treasures of the devil tablet mountain belong to our devil clan!”</p><p>A few shriveled and unpleasant sounds rang out as a few figures flew past in front of him.</p><p>They were all from the demonic Sha clan, and their auras were very strong. With a quick glance, Lu Ming discovered that a few of them were at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Could the person they’re talking about be little Qing? not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed and he followed the three demons from a distance.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Chi Chi!</p><p>Not long after, a violent roar came from the front, as well as the sound of sharp weapons piercing through the air.</p><p>The battle was still ongoing.</p><p>This made Lu Ming’s heart relax a little.</p><p>In front of them, a few Mo Sha clansmen increased their speed and flew over like lightning. They flew over a few mountains and joined the battle while roaring.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Using the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, Lu Ming’s figure crossed the last few hundred miles in an instant and arrived at the battlefield.</p><p>In front of them, more than a dozen powerful demons were attacking a human woman.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat when he saw the woman.</p><p>The woman was wearing a long black dress. Her beauty was unparalleled. Who else could it be but Xie nianqing?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
