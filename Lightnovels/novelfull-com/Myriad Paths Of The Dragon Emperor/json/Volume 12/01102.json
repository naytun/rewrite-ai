He stretched out his hand and grabbed the old man with a perfect spirit embryo, leaving without looking back.</p><p>Today, the Huang family had completely lost face.</p><p>The commander of the law enforcement Army snorted and left.</p><p>The surrounding people looked at each other in disbelief.</p><p>They had originally thought that this commander would be dead for sure since the Huang family had launched a large-scale attack. However, they didn’t expect that even though the experts of the Huang family had come, they had returned with dejected faces. As for this commander, he hadn’t even suffered a single injury. This was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>“This commander of the law enforcement Army is really awesome!”</p><p>he’s really awesome. He’s the most awesome law enforcement army commander I’ve ever seen!</p><p>The crowd was in a heated discussion.</p><p>The people from the law enforcement Army were also at a loss for words. They didn’t expect the final result to be like this.</p><p>But, it felt great!</p><p>The eyes of the eighty or ninety law enforcement soldiers lit up. They felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was full of admiration.</p><p>“The mighty commander!”</p><p>Tie Xing roared.</p><p>“Alright, cut the crap and get to work!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hands and went back to his room.</p><p>The crowd dispersed, but the news of an impressive commander in the law enforcement Army spread like a whirlwind. It gave everyone another topic to talk about besides cultivating.</p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming had been in the law enforcement Army for half a month.</p><p>In the past half a month, other than cultivating, Lu Ming had been strolling around the holy city.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t really wandering around. He was just loitering outside the palace to see if he could find an opportunity to slip in.</p><p>In the end, he had no choice but to give up.</p><p>There were too many terrifying existences in the Imperial Palace. He had once sensed carefully and discovered that there were many terrifying existences in the Imperial Palace that could easily kill him.</p><p>There were even some auras that were extremely terrifying, just like the aura of the Supreme-being. They were definitely at the Supreme-being level. Lu Ming could sense more than ten auras like this.</p><p>This was what Lu Ming sensed. There must be something that he did not sense.</p><p>Even though the ancient Saint dynasty was weak, a starving camel was still bigger than a horse. The ancient Saint dynasty was still the most powerful Overlord force in the central continent.</p><p>This was normal. If they weren’t strong, they would have been destroyed by the other Overlord forces. Many Overlord forces were eyeing them covetously.</p><p>In the past half a month, more and more people had come to the sacred city. The million-year National sacrifice of the ancient Saint dynasty was getting closer and closer.</p><p>However, due to the incident with the Huang family, some small forces would not be too presumptuous. In the area under Lu Ming’s jurisdiction, there were no major events.</p><p>On this day, a shocking piece of news spread in the sacred city.</p><p>The sage Emperor intended to choose a husband for one of the princesses in this one-million-year National sacrifice, and he wanted to choose one of the heroes of the younger generation.</p><p>The news was like an earthquake, shaking the sacred city and shocking countless people.</p><p>The current Sage Emperor had a total of sixteen children.</p><p>There were thirteen princes and only three princesses.</p><p>However, the thirteen princes were completely suppressed by the three princesses. This was because two of the three princesses were famous throughout the world. They were simply too outstanding.</p><p>Xie nianjun, one of the five young tycoons of central continent, was also one of the five great beauties of central continent.</p><p>There was also a Princess named Xie nianlin. She was also one of the five beauties of the central continent. Although her martial arts talent was slightly inferior to Xie nianjun’s, she was also a second-grade heaven’s favorite. She was as famous as goddess Tan Xiang.</p><p>These two princesses were simply too outstanding, making countless people envious.</p><p>It was said that there was also a Princess who was the youngest of all the princes and princesses. She was also peerless in her beauty and temperament. She was not inferior to the other two princesses at all. Even her martial arts talent was shocking, but not many people had seen her before.</p><p>That was because the princess was an anomaly in the Royal Xie family.</p><p>The word ‘variant’ was a taboo word in the Royal Xie family. The Royal Xie family had declined because of a variant.</p><p>Which Princess was he looking for?</p><p>Everyone was extremely curious. However, no matter which Princess it was, many young geniuses from the major forces were tempted.</p><p>After that, all the major forces sent people to investigate and verify the authenticity of the news.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked when he heard this piece of news.</p><p>Who was the one choosing a husband for the princess?</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with worry. He was afraid that it was Xie nianqing!</p><p>Three days later, even more shocking news spread.</p><p>The current Sage Emperor had personally spoken, ordering people to spread the news.</p><p>It was true that he was choosing a husband for a Princess. This Princess was Xie nianlin.</p><p>On top of that, there would be a competition between the young geniuses on the day of the million-year National sacrifice. The winner would become Xie nianlin’s husband and enter the ancient Saint emperor’s palace to cultivate.</p><p>The second and third place winners would be able to propose a condition to the sage Emperor, which the sage Emperor would try his best to fulfill. At the same time, they would be able to enter the ancient Hall for comprehension.</p><p>As for those ranked fourth to tenth, they would be able to enter the ancient Saint Emperor’s Hall to cultivate.</p><p>Once the news was out, the sacred city was shaken and countless people were shocked. At the same time, the news spread like a whirlwind to the central continent and even the four other territories.</p><p>Countless Young heaven’s favorites were shocked and revealed a fiery glow.</p><p>There were some geniuses who were not interested in first place and being able to marry a Princess. They were interested in one of the conditions the Saint-Emperor had set for them, which was to enter the Saint-Emperor’s ancient palace to cultivate.</p><p>The sage Emperor was an Emperor, so there was no need to mention the value of his condition.</p><p>The Saint Emperor’s ancient palace was a Holy Land for cultivation.</p><p>It was said that the ancient Saint dynasty’s Saint emperors ‘comprehensions were contained within. If one could comprehend them and gain something, it would be extremely useful for breaking through to the Emperor level.</p><p>The Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty had a legacy that had lasted for millions of years. They had produced many emperors throughout the generations, and this was why they had remained so powerful. Some people said that this had something to do with the ancient Saint Emperor Palace.</p><p>This made the heaven’s favorites who were interested in the emperor’s path extremely excited. After confirming the news, they all rushed to the sacred city.</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a huge sigh of relief when he heard that. That Princess was not Xie nianqing.</p><p>But at the same time, Lu Ming was extremely tempted.</p><p>He wasn’t interested in Xie nianlin, nor was he interested in entering the Saint Emperor’s ancient Hall. He was interested in one of the Saint Emperor’s conditions.</p><p>If he could get second or third place, he would be able to make a request to the sage Emperor to let Xie nianqing go.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming had already decided to participate in the competition.</p><p>This news caused chaos in the ancient Saint dynasty and became the top topic of discussion. This news was discussed every day.</p><p>Many people were also secretly guessing why the sage Emperor would do this.</p><p>However, it wasn’t hard for those with foresight to guess that the royal family and the Xie family wanted to use this method to strengthen the royal family’s strength.</p><p>The heaven’s pride expert who could get first place and marry Princess Xie nianlin must be from a powerful force. This way, the imperial family’s strength would be increased through marriage.</p><p>At the same time, by opening up the Saint Emperor ancient palace, they could also befriend those geniuses and the overlords. This was something that they had no choice but to do. From this, one could see how weak the Xie clan of the ancient Saint dynasty was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
