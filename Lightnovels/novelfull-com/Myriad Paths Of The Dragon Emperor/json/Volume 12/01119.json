Challenging them would be no different from admitting defeat.</p><p>in addition, Emperor gods who have grasped the concept of space are also excluded.</p><p>Wu chengkong, who had always been at the top of the second-grade heaven’s favorites, was also excluded.</p><p>There were also a few other people who were unfathomable. There were also the two magnificently beautiful goddesses, Tan Xiang fairy and Jing kongling. They were the targets of many people’s pursuit. Of course, no one would challenge them.</p><p>There were only a few people left.</p><p>Many people’s gazes swept between Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had defeated Wu Cang before, Wu Cang was considered weak among the second-grade talents.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had used a treasure to block the attack of a fourth level spiritual God previously. However, in such a situation, he would naturally not let you use a treasure to win. You would still have to rely on your own strength.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming was undoubtedly one of the best targets to challenge.</p><p>before we start, I’ll make two points. First, this is only a competition, so you can’t kill your opponent. Second, you can’t rely too much on external objects. You have to rely on your own strength!</p><p>Xie Qitian announced.</p><p>“You, big beard, I challenge you!”</p><p>“What are you doing? That big-bearded man is mine!”</p><p>“All of you, get lost! He’s mine!”</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Xie Qitian finished his sentence, a few people had their eyes on Lu Ming, wanting to challenge him.</p><p>“Nest, do you all think I’m easy to bully?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with ferocity as he swept his gaze over the few of them.</p><p>wait a minute. It’s too chaotic to challenge like this. Let’s do it according to the results. Those with good results in the last 20 can have the priority to challenge!</p><p>Xie Qitian’s voice was heard, and the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Then, an old man walked out and reported the names of the last twenty people.</p><p>The more they reported, the uglier their expressions became.</p><p>Those with good results could challenge first, so they would definitely challenge the weaker ones. In other words, the one who stayed until the end would definitely be the strongest.</p><p>For example, who would challenge Long Chen, yang potian, and the others?</p><p>Those who were ranked lower would definitely encounter yang potian and the others. How could their expressions be good?</p><p>“Now, let’s begin!”</p><p>Xie Qitian announced after the ranking was announced.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin stepped out. Her result was the best among the last 20 people. She had almost charged into the top 20.</p><p>She swept her gaze across the room and eventually landed on Lu Ming. A cold glint flashed across her eyes as she said, ” “Big beard, I challenge you!”</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming did not give her any face and even suppressed the cold-blood Hall’s talent in front of everyone. In Liu Yuxin’s opinion, this was a slap to her face. She had long wanted to teach Lu Ming a lesson. Now that she had such a chance, how could she miss it?</p><p>“Little girl, you want to challenge me? Just like I said before, be careful or I’ll beat you up!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned, his gaze sweeping across a certain part of Liu Yuxin.</p><p>“You … You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin’s expression was ugly.</p><p>“This guy is really looking for death!”</p><p>One of the Big Five, Lion Capital, emitted a cold light and killing intent from his eyes, causing the people standing beside him to shiver.</p><p>In the central continent, everyone knew that the lion Capital had always been Liu Yuxin’s pursuer. Since Lu Ming dared to tease Liu Yuxin like this, it was obvious that the lion Capital had its eyes on him.</p><p>Liu Yuxin challenged Lu Ming. The others retreated and stood at the edge of the platform. Only Lu Ming and Liu Yuxin were standing opposite each other on the platform.</p><p>“If I don’t beat you up until you beg for mercy, my name isn’t Liu Yuxin!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin’s beautiful eyes were filled with coldness.</p><p>She had enough confidence to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>This was because she hadn’t used her full strength when she was screening.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Liu Yuxin moved and pounced toward Lu Ming. The strange thing was that as Liu Yuxin rushed out, her figure actually increased in number.</p><p>One split into two, two into four, four into eight …</p><p>In the end, the platform was filled with Liu Yuxin’s silhouettes. There were hundreds of them, and they were densely packed, surrounding Liu Yuxin.</p><p>this is the illusionary demon movement technique of the illusionary sect. Liu Yuxin has actually cultivated it to this level. It’s truly shocking!</p><p>At the edge of the platform, a second-grade heaven’s favorite recognized this movement technique and revealed a serious expression.</p><p>How could they resist when hundreds of figures appeared all at once?</p><p>Liu Yuxin’s combat strength was considered to be in the upper tier even among the second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“Illusionary demon finger!”</p><p>With a delicate shout, the hundreds of figures stretched out their hands at the same time.</p><p>Her slender fingers were more powerful than divine weapons. They pierced through the void and tried to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>From all directions, the finger force was aimed at Lu Ming’s vital points.</p><p>A black long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Minglu was from the black spear sect, so he had bought a black spear, a medium Lv 8 spiritual weapon, some time ago.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The long spear shook, and a black spear flower condensed in the air and flew toward the finger force.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>A wave of dense collision sounds rang out, and the spear flowers and finger forces disappeared one after another.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, the black Spear’s radiance expanded and swept out with the momentum of sweeping away thousands of troops.</p><p>However, Liu Yuxin’s movement technique was indeed impressive. In the face of such an attack, hundreds of figures floated on the platform, flashing and avoiding Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>“Let’s see how many shots you can Dodge.”</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and continuously swept it out. The Spear’s gleam was like a Black Dragon, surging violently on the huge platform and enveloping the entire platform.</p><p>Although Liu Yuxin’s movement technique was strong, on such a platform, its power was greatly reduced. Soon, she couldn’t avoid it. One by one, her figure was hit by the spear light and dissipated.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Hmph! Liu Yuxin snorted coldly. She didn’t retreat, but advanced instead. Her figure flickered non-stop, and she was incredibly fast.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear was like a dragon, but he could not hit him.</p><p>As she neared Lu Ming, a cloud of gray fog appeared above Liu Yuxin’s head. On the gray fog, there were eight golden chakras.</p><p>This was Liu Yuxin’s bloodline.</p><p>“Great dream of spring and autumn!”</p><p>At that moment, Liu Yuxin turned into a cloud of gray mist. The gray mist expanded rapidly and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>When Lu Ming was enveloped by the gray fog, the surrounding world suddenly changed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth shook violently. Lu Ming saw that a brutal battle was taking place in front of him.</p><p>“Talisman Amulet sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>In front of them was the talisman Amulet sect. At this moment, the yin and yang formation of the talisman Amulet sect had been broken. The Army of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace was swarming in and killing their way into the yin and yang mountain. At this moment, both sides were engaged in a bloody battle.</p><p>He saw Yan kuangtu, the nine suns Supreme, being killed by Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others had died at the hands of the Supreme martial artists of the Emperor heaven divine Palace.</p><p>His parents, his disciples, and his friends had all been turned into ashes in the bloody battle.</p><p>illusion, illusion, this is an illusion!</p><p>Lu Ming took a deep breath, his eyes glimmering.</p><p>In the secret realm of the Saint mansion, he had once entered an illusion created by a being that surpassed the Emperor level and almost lost himself. Compared to that illusion, this one was too fake. How could it confuse Lu Ming?</p><p>Lu Ming slowly closed his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
