This time, she didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>“That’s right. I’ve warned you twice before, but you didn’t listen. You’re just a little girl. I’ll teach you a lesson on behalf of your elders. Don’t hold a grudge. I’m doing this for your own good!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke with conviction, like an elder disciplining a junior.</p><p>In addition to his long beard, he looked like he was almost 40 years old. He really did have that kind of taste.</p><p>Liu Yuxin could only glare at Lu Ming hatefully. She did not dare to say a word, but she could not wait to cut Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>She hated it. In the future, when people saw her, they would definitely think of this big bearded man.</p><p>alright, that’s all for today. Be more obedient in the future and don’t be so arrogant!</p><p>With that, Lu Ming waved his hand and Liu Yuxin flew out.</p><p>When she flew out of the platform, Lu Ming had already released the quintessential essence that was sealed in her body. Liu Yuxin’s body was filled with quintessential essence. She glanced at Lu Ming with killing intent, then flew toward the illusionary sect’s seat without saying a word.</p><p>“Ming Lu wins this battle!”</p><p>An elder from the Royal Xie family announced.</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and walked to the side of the platform.</p><p>“This big brother is amazing, this little monk is impressed!”</p><p>At the side, the unscrupulous monk put his hands together in front of his chest, his face full of admiration.</p><p>This made the people around him feel extremely ‘despondent’. Was this monk really a holy monk from the Western Desert?</p><p>“Haha, master, you’re too kind!”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually, but he did not dare to look down on this unscrupulous monk. He felt that this monk was unfathomable.</p><p>Next, the competition continued. One of the southern underworld’s geniuses stepped forward. His ranking was only second to Liu Yuxin.</p><p>This person chose a heaven’s favorite who was slightly weaker. Unfortunately, he still failed and followed in Liu Yuxin’s footsteps.</p><p>Next, the challenges continued, one by one.</p><p>The two people who came out later were both very powerful, and they both won.</p><p>However, from the fifth challenge onwards, the challengers began to lose consecutively.</p><p>Kong Xin had challenged Wu chengkong and was defeated. Wu chengkong’s cultivation had reached the second level of the spiritual God Realm. He must have made another breakthrough during this period.</p><p>Two people challenged goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling, but they both failed.</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang had used her body to inscribe the formation. The killing formation within her body erupted and was extremely powerful.</p><p>In addition to his pill refining and weapon transformation technique, his combat strength was astonishing.</p><p>The puresky spirit had comprehended three intents, and the fusion of the three intents was mysterious and unpredictable. Its combat power was also very strong, so it wouldn’t be very difficult to defeat an opponent.</p><p>Then, someone challenged the Emperor God.</p><p>Space will was indeed the king of will. The more he cultivated, the more powerful it became. In the end, Emperor God also defeated his opponent and kept his place in the top 20.</p><p>Soon, only Long Chen, yang potian, and the heartless monk were left.</p><p>The remaining nine people who had not challenged him had extremely ugly expressions.</p><p>Some people were really unwilling to give up, and after picking and choosing, they finally chose the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>This guy doesn’t look reliable, maybe his combat strength isn’t strong?</p><p>Then, the second-grade heaven’s favorite who issued the challenge was sent flying off the platform by the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>Winning in one move, the difference was too great.</p><p>The remaining eight sighed. They knew that there was no point in challenging him, so they all admitted defeat.</p><p>The first round ended.</p><p>There were twenty people left.</p><p>The crowd turned to look at Xie Qitian, curious to know the rules of the next round. Was it going to be a one-on-one battle again?</p><p>let’s decide the winner in the second round and the ranking in one fell swoop!</p><p>the 20 of you will fight in a free-for-all on the platform. You can fight however you like, and the results will be calculated based on the time you stay on the platform. The longer you stay on the platform, the better the results will be. The top ten and top three will be decided in the end! Xie Qitian said.</p><p>“Chaotic battle?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Xie Qitian had actually decided to use a free-for-all method, allowing the twenty Supreme talents on the field to decide the winner in a free-for-all.</p><p>The situation had become complicated.</p><p>A chaotic battle was not a one-on-one battle. One could join forces or form an alliance. The situation was ever-changing.</p><p>“Now, let’s begin!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as Xie Qitian’s voice fell, a figure flashed on the platform, away from the people around him, and stared at the others cautiously.</p><p>Because, other than yourself, everyone else is an enemy, and you can’t be sure who will suddenly attack you.</p><p>Only Long Chen was calm and indifferent. He stood there casually, looking straight ahead as if he didn’t care at all.</p><p>On the platform, everyone looked at each other, and the atmosphere was extremely tense.</p><p>“Yang potian, let’s continue our battle. We must determine the winner today!”</p><p>A loud roar broke the silence.</p><p>Tuoba Shi charged towards yang potian with his Mace in hand.</p><p>“That’s just what I want. I’ll defeat you today!”</p><p>The heavenly halberd appeared in yang potian’s hand. He took a step forward and charged towards Tuoba Shi.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The heaven scorcher halberd and the wolf-tooth club collided heavily. The space was directly torn apart, and a terrifying force swept in all directions.</p><p>third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>Yang potian and Tuoba Shi’s cultivation had indeed broken through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm. They were even more powerful than when they were in the Saint mansion’s Secret realm.</p><p>This kind of heaven’s favorite was truly terrifying. Not only was his combat strength shocking, but his cultivation speed was also terrifyingly fast.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged over a dozen moves in a row, and the entire world seemed to be trembling.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>The second-grade heaven’s favorites were shocked when they saw this.</p><p>Was this the strength of a young big Shot? He was too strong. How could they compete with him?</p><p>“Bald donkeys of Western Desert, let’s see if you have made any progress in your strength after not making a move for a while!”</p><p>Nanming, the young man covered in black flames, stared at the monk and the female Bodhisattva.</p><p>“Little fire Dog, this little monk will grant you your wish!”</p><p>The heartless monk stepped forward with a dignified expression. His entire body was covered in golden light as he struck out a Golden Palm towards the young man who was covered in black flames.</p><p>The black flames on the young man’s body started to burn. It was extremely terrifying, as if it was the flames from hell.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The unscrupulous monk and the young man with black flames exchanged a few blows. The flames and golden light split the world into two, and the people around them retreated far away.</p><p>Fortunately, the platform was large enough and sturdy. Otherwise, the others would not have a place to stand.</p><p>The commotion caused by the battle between the two of them was no less than that caused by yang potian and Tuoba Shi.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The female Bodhisattva of the Western Desert chanted the name of Buddha, and the light of Buddha filled the air as she stepped out.</p><p>With every step she took, a Golden Lotus would appear under her feet. It was Holy and beautiful.</p><p>Her target was dark Child.</p><p>The Western Desert and the southern nether had been enemies since ancient times. One was Buddha, the other evil!</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the two territories had known each other for a long time and had fought many times in the past. Now that they met here, they would naturally fight each other.</p><p>Without a doubt, Dark Child and the female Bodhisattva were also powerful figures. The battle between the two was extremely shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
