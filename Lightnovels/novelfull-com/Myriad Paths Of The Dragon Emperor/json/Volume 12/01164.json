Many people were so shocked that they almost jumped up.</p><p>...</p><p>“What? Xie Luan? The chaotic sky Emperor?”</p><p>“How is that possible? Hadn’t the chaotic heavens divine warrior already died 30000 years ago? Why are you still alive?”</p><p>even if he’s not dead, he can’t have lived for thirty thousand years. What’s going on? ”</p><p>The sacred city was in a clamor. Everyone was shouting and shouting in disbelief. It was too shocking.</p><p>Who didn’t know of Xie Luan’s name in any of the larger factions?</p><p>Central continent’s current situation was all because of one person, Xie Luan.</p><p>No one would have believed it if it were not for Xie Qitian’s words that a legendary figure, who had long been thought to be dead, had actually reappeared.</p><p>hahaha, it’s been 30000 years. I didn’t expect someone to still remember me!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed.</p><p>These words silenced the crowd, and everyone turned to look at Xie Luan.</p><p>This person was really Xie Luan!</p><p>“How can this be? Xie Luan has reappeared. Is the world going to be in chaos again?”</p><p>Many people had the same thought.</p><p>There were also some people who thought of more.</p><p>They finally knew why the Royal Xie family had activated the celestial mystery instrument to capture Lu Ming and why they had offered a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure as a reward. It was because of Xie Luan.</p><p>Xie Luan was with Lu Ming.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was the reason why Xie Luan was able to return to the world?</p><p>Many people could not help but think of this.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At that moment, the space behind Xie Luan and Lu Ming cracked open. Two figures stepped out.</p><p>As soon as the two of them appeared, their bodies emitted an aura that dominated the world.</p><p>The aura of an Emperor.</p><p>“It’s the wujue sword Emperor and the Thunder saber Emperor!”</p><p>Someone recognized the two of them and exclaimed.</p><p>The others were shocked. They didn’t expect that two more emperors would be drawn out.</p><p>Was an earth-shattering battle between emperors going to break out today?</p><p>Xie Qitian, you’re really good. You knew that Xie Luan had appeared, but you still wanted to use us to get rid of him and test his strength.</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor said in a cold voice.</p><p>This time, the heavenly martial Sword School had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>Not only were many spirit God powerhouses killed, but even a division was destroyed. Not only did a Supreme martial artist die in battle, but the demon fetus was also lost.</p><p>If the demon fetus was successfully cultivated, it would be an existence that could fight against emperors.</p><p>How could the wujue sword Emperor not be angry?</p><p>“I wasn’t sure at first whether it was Xie Luan who was born!”</p><p>Xie Qitian explained casually, but his eyes were still on Xie Luan. Xie Luan, I didn’t expect that you would still be alive after being suppressed for thirty thousand years. You’re even able to come out into the world. This is really beyond my expectations!</p><p>haha, I have to thank you for sending Lu Ming to the abyss demon territory. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have been able to escape. Speaking of which, you’re the one who started it. I should be thanking you!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>It turned out that the reason why Xie Luan could return to the world was really because of Lu Ming.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ming had saved Xie Luan.</p><p>Those who knew the inside story sighed. If the royal family of the Xie family had not locked Xie nianqing up in the abyss demonic realm, Lu Ming would not have entered the abyss demonic realm. If Lu Ming had not entered, how could he have saved Xie Luan?</p><p>Everything was because of the imperial family. How ironic.</p><p>Xie Luan was right. If not for the imperial family, how could Xie Luan have escaped?</p><p>“Hmph, Xie Luan, so what if you’ve escaped? You’ve been suppressed for thirty thousand years, and your vitality has been greatly damaged. Your demonic body has been injured, and your strength is far from fully recovered. Today, I’ll kill you completely to prevent any future trouble!”</p><p>Said Xie Qitian, his cold killing intent bloomed.</p><p>The other two sovereigns ‘auras also spread out from Xie Qitian’s side, locking onto Xie Luan to prevent him from escaping.</p><p>“Wujue sword Emperor, Thunder saber Emperor, why don’t you join forces with me to get rid of Xie Lun today? This Emperor will definitely reward you greatly!”</p><p>Xie Qitian looked at the wujue sword Emperor and the Thunder saber Emperor.</p><p>hehe, Xie Qitian, this is your Xie family’s business. I won’t get involved!</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor chuckled.</p><p>“I’m not interested either!” The Thunder Blade Emperor also shook his head.</p><p>This made Xie Qitian and the others ‘eyes flash with killing intent, and they were unhappy.</p><p>They knew what the wujue sword Emperor and the Thunder saber Emperor were thinking.</p><p>If the Imperial Xie family suffered some losses in the battle with Xie Luan, or even both sides suffered heavy losses, it would be a good thing for the other overlords. They could take the opportunity to weaken the Imperial Xie family, or even destroy them.</p><p>Why would they help the Xie clan?</p><p>haha, junior, I didn’t come here today to fight with you. I’m here to give you a treasure!</p><p>Xie Luan suddenly laughed.</p><p>Give him treasures?</p><p>His words not only confused the others in the sacred city, but even Xie Qitian, sword Emperor wujue, and the others were also confused.</p><p>“Xie Luan, what are you trying to do?”</p><p>Xie Qitian said in a serious tone.</p><p>In the ancient records of the Xie clan, Xie Luan was not only unparalleled in battle strength, but also in stratagems. He had to be on guard.</p><p>“You’ll know when you see it!”</p><p>Xie Luan smiled. He extended his palm, and a golden light bloomed from it.</p><p>It was a golden token. After it appeared, it expanded rapidly, turning into a giant token that was a hundred meters tall and dozens of meters wide.</p><p>On the token, there were two words-Heavenly King!</p><p>As soon as they saw the token, Xie Qitian, the other two sovereigns of the royal family, the wujue sword Emperor, and the Thunder saber Emperor’s eyes widened, and they were filled with greed.</p><p>the Heavenly King’s token, this is the Heavenly King’s token. The Heavenly King’s token is in your hands? ”</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor shouted. His eyes were burning with greed, and his eyes were red.</p><p>Xie Qitian and the other sovereigns were also staring at the Heavenly King’s token in Xie Luan’s hand.</p><p>the Heavenly King token! It’s the legendary Heavenly King token!</p><p>Some of the older spirit God powerhouses could not help but exclaim in shock.</p><p>This made the others look at each other in confusion. What kind of treasure was this Heavenly King token? It actually made the Emperor jealous.</p><p>this Heavenly King token is indeed very tempting to an Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>On the way here, Xie Luan had already briefly explained to Lu Ming about the function of the Heavenly King’s token.</p><p>This world was called the primordial realm. It was vast and boundless.</p><p>Although the divine wilderness continent was huge, it was just a grain of sand compared to the entire primordial realm. It was extremely tiny.</p><p>In the sea, there were countless other continents like the divine wilderness continent. Some were even bigger than the divine wilderness continent. They were several times bigger, or even dozens of times, or even hundreds of times.</p><p>However, the true core of the primordial realm, the true center, was a piece of land called the yuan continent.</p><p>Legend had it that the yuan continent was the true core of the yuan realm. That place was vast and boundless, and its surface area was many times larger than the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>There were countless forces and experts there. Emperors were ordinary people there, and Saints who surpassed emperors could be seen everywhere.</p><p>There was a terrifyingly huge faction there. That faction was not something the so-called Overlord factions of the divine wilderness continent could compare to. The difference was like the difference between heaven and earth. Any one of them could destroy all the factions in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>The cultivation environment there was also many times better than the divine wilderness continent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
