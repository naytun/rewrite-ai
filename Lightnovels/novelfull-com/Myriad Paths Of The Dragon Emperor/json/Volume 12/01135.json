Whoosh!…</p><p>...</p><p>The four elders appeared around Lu Ming and surrounded him. Their terrifying auras bloomed without any concealment, forming a terrifying pressure that pressed down on him.</p><p>Two were at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, and two were at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming could sense the strength of the four people.</p><p>“The Royal Xie family is truly despicable!”</p><p>Lu Ming wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>To be able to enter this place to kill him, other than the royal family and the Xie family, there would not be a second force.</p><p>He didn’t need to guess to know that these four people were definitely sent by the royal family’s Xie family.</p><p>Lu Ming had not expected the Royal Xie family, the royal family of the ancient Saint dynasty, to be so despicable.</p><p>He promised him in front of others, but secretly sent people to kill him.</p><p>Moreover, they really thought highly of him, sending two seventh level spiritual gods and two eighth level spiritual gods.</p><p>This kind of person was considered a high-level spiritual God. Even among the various forces, he was considered a top expert.</p><p>Those who were able to cultivate to the seventh tier of the spiritual God Realm and above were not weak in their talents. Generally, it would be difficult for those with second or third level divine level bloodlines to cultivate to the seventh tier of the spiritual God Realm and above. Those who were able to reach the seventh tier of the spiritual God Realm and above would usually awaken bloodlines that were fourth level divine level and above.</p><p>There was no doubt that such a person had definitely mastered a God-level martial technique and was very powerful.</p><p>Even with Lu Ming’s combat strength, it would not be a problem for him to defeat or even kill an expert at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm. However, he would definitely not be a match for an expert at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Not to mention the existence of an eighth level spiritual God. Facing an eighth level spiritual God, Lu Ming’s chances of survival were slim.</p><p>This time, it was a sure kill!</p><p>impudent! The royal family is not something you can comment on. You want to save Xie nianqing? what a wild dream!</p><p>An elder in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm berated. A battle saber was suspended above his head, and a terrifying saber intent bloomed in the air.</p><p>hehe, acting one way in front of others and another way behind others. To do such a despicable and shameless thing, how can you have the face to be part of the royal family? no wonder the Xie family declined!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>How dare you! You’re courting death! Everyone, you’ll hold the line for me. Leave this kid to me. I’ll kill him today!</p><p>The old man with the floating saber shouted with a sharp killing intent.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll leave him to you!”</p><p>The elder at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm who had attacked earlier nodded and retreated with the other two people. They formed a huge encirclement, surrounding Lu Ming and his companion in the middle and blocking all of Lu Ming’s escape routes.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber trembled as it was held by the old man. His eyes were filled with excitement and he said with a ferocious smile,”Lu Ming, remember, the one who killed you is Xie Xie!”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The saber slashed down and the saber power filled the air. A vast and terrifying saber radiance slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The third bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head. A wisp of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, turning his long black hair blood red. At the same time, the third bloodline squirmed and transformed into a long spear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming held the long spear in his hand and swept it out, colliding with the saber gleam.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying sound of the explosion spread thousands of miles away. Lu Ming’s body trembled and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>the seventh level spiritual God Realm’s combat strength is indeed terrifying!</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>His combat strength at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm had completely surpassed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Die! So what if you’re a heaven’s favorite whose name shakes the world? So what if he was a rare heaven’s favorite? You’re still going to die in my hands!”</p><p>Xie Xie howled, his saber intent growing stronger as he charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming transformed into the nine Dragons. With the power of his third bloodline, he launched a violent attack and fought Xie Xie.</p><p>Xie Xie also used his bloodline fusion. Xie Xie’s bloodline was a fifth level divine level saber. Under the activation of his seventh level spiritual God cultivation, it was incomparably powerful. Lu Ming was completely suppressed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of moves had been exchanged, and several saber wounds had appeared on the nine Dragons ‘body.</p><p>this person’s combat strength is truly astonishing. With his cultivation at the third level of the spiritual God Realm, he was actually able to fight with Xie Xie for such a long time. It’s simply unbelievable!</p><p>An elder at the side said. Even though he was about to kill Lu Ming, he could not help but exclaim.</p><p>In the spiritual God Realm, it would be more difficult to fight across levels as one advanced.</p><p>To be able to fight so many moves with a seventh level spiritual God Realm expert with a cultivation of the third level spiritual God Realm was truly too shocking. It was simply inconceivable.</p><p>They had lived for thousands of years, but this was the first time they had seen such a thing.</p><p>this kid’s talent is truly heaven-defying. In the divine wilderness continent, other than Long Chen, no one is his match. In time, he will become a terrifying and invincible Emperor. Unfortunately, this kid is too lawless. Only death awaits him!</p><p>The other elder said. His voice was cold, but his eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>“Brat, die!”</p><p>Xie Xie roared, his battle prowess growing even more violent.</p><p>After exchanging dozens of moves, he still could not kill Lu Ming. He felt very embarrassed and the killing intent in his heart grew stronger.</p><p>old man, you’ve cultivated for thousands of years and only have this little combat power. If I were you, I would have killed myself!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke sarcastically, but he was rapidly thinking of a way to escape.</p><p>The surroundings were sealed off by three powerhouses. It was too difficult to break through.</p><p>The main thing was that the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm was too powerful. If there were four seventh level spiritual God Realm existences, Lu Ming would have full confidence in breaking through with the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. However, with two eighth level spiritual God Realm existences, the chances of Lu Ming breaking through were very small.</p><p>brat, you think you’re a genius? a dead genius is no genius. Let me tell you, after I kill you today, I’ll go after Xie nianqing. If you want to leave, dream on!</p><p>Xie Xie coldly shouted, his attacks becoming even more violent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bloodshot as he bellowed, ” “You still want to kill little Qing?”</p><p>that lowly beast should have died long ago. This time, I’ll take care of him as well!</p><p>Xie Xie sneered.</p><p>“You all deserve to die, die, kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a furious roar. His third Blood Meridian trembled and wisps of energy surged towards Lu Ming, filling his heart with endless killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent was already frighteningly intense when Xie Xie said that they were going to kill Xie nianqing. Coupled with the power of his third bloodline, there was only endless killing intent in his mind.</p><p>kid, stop! You can’t use too much of your bloodline’s power. Otherwise, you’ll become a puppet that only knows how to kill!</p><p>Dandan called out to Lu Ming, allowing him to barely retain a trace of clarity.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body seemed to be filled with infinite power. The nine Dragons emitted a thick blood-red color.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The nine Dragons swiped their claws at Xie Xie.</p><p>“Not good, this strength …”</p><p>Xie Xie’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>In an instant, he felt the power in Lu Ming’s body increase explosively, especially his killing intent. It was extremely terrifying, as if he wanted to kill all the living creatures in the world. It made his heart turn cold and he shivered.</p><p>The claws of the nine Dragons clawed at him, and he seemed to be suffocating.</p><p>Xie Xie let out a hysterical roar and launched his most powerful attack to collide with the nine Dragons ‘dragon claws.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
