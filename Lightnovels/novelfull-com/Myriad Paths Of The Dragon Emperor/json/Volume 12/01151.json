I can’t tear space to travel anymore. I’ll be relying on you next!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded, frowning slightly. He was considering finding a place to hide. He would hide in the mountain and river diagram and wait until Xie Luan had successfully cultivated the nine seals of the gate of God.</p><p>He didn’t believe that the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument could still appear after entering the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan’s eyes flickered. He looked in a direction and sneered, I didn’t expect that even some fifth and sixth level spiritual god level trash would come to join in the fun. Lu Ming, you should have no problem dealing with fifth and sixth level spiritual God trash, right? get me some tonics!</p><p>With that, Xie Luan entered Lu Ming’s body and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air and waited quietly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Not long after, a series of air-piercing sounds rang out in the air as sword lights tore through the void and flew over.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the five sword gleams disappeared and five figures stood around Lu Ming, surrounding him in the middle.</p><p>Among the five figures, there was an old man and a middle-aged man. However, they were all wearing the same white robe and carrying a long sword on their back.</p><p>“The heavenly martial sword faction!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a cold killing intent.</p><p>Among the five people, two were at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, and three were at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. All of them were from the heavenly martial sword faction. Lu Ming knew that this territory was most likely the territory of the heavenly martial sword faction. Otherwise, how could he have encountered five people at once? they were all from the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>hahaha, we’re the first to find it. What great luck!</p><p>A middle-aged brawny man laughed loudly. His aura was violent, and the aura of a sixth level spiritual God was revealed without a doubt. He looked at Lu Ming with a burning gaze.</p><p>If he killed Lu Ming, he would have a Heavenly Tribulation-transcending treasure. At the thought of this, his heart trembled with excitement.</p><p>although he’s young, he can’t be underestimated. I heard that he displayed terrifying combat strength in the holy city, second only to Long Chen!</p><p>An old man in the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm said with a serious expression.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? No matter how strong he is, he’s only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. We have two sixth level spiritual gods and three fifth level spiritual gods here. Can he still overturn the heavens?”</p><p>The middle-aged man from before said, full of confidence.</p><p>“Are you done with your nonsense?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice stunned the five people from the sky martial sword faction. They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Enough of your nonsense, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lu Ming’s aura exploded, and eight streams of dragon energy instantly erupted in his body. He took a step forward and rushed toward a fifth level spiritual God Realm expert, striking out with his palm.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>This palm was terrifyingly powerful. The space crumbled like tofu under the palm, and the terrifying aura completely enveloped the other party.</p><p>The man’s eyes widened and he looked extremely frightened. However, he did not even have the chance to scream before he was torn into pieces by Lu Ming’s terrifying strength, his blood splattering across the sky.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“You’re looking for death, how dare you sneak attack!”</p><p>The other four were stunned for a moment, then they roared and unsheathed their swords. A vast sword power rose into the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. The third bloodline appeared above his head and a wisp of energy surged into his body. Lu Ming’s body was covered in a bloody light and his killing intent swept out like a tide.</p><p>A drop of blood turned into a blood-red sword. Lu Ming held it in his hand and slashed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash of blood-red light, it slashed toward the middle-aged man in the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Enveloped by the endless killing intent, the middle-aged man shuddered and his eyes were filled with fear. He tried his best to slash out with his sword, but the sword radiance collapsed under Lu Ming’s blood-red sword radiance. The blood-red sword radiance cut through the middle-aged man’s glabella.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The middle-aged man was split in half, and even the spiritual God did not manage to escape.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the remaining three people were scared out of their wits.</p><p>How could Lu Ming be so terrifying? Even an expert at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm was killed by a single sword strike. This was a gap of three levels.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>At that moment, they only had one thought in their minds, and that was to escape.</p><p>The further he ran, the better. This was a god of death.</p><p>The three of them turned into three sword lights and fled in three different directions.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and executed the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps, charging towards a fifth level spiritual God Realm expert. In an instant, he caught up to the person and slashed out with his sword.</p><p>That person let out a desperate roar and fought back with all his might, but it was useless. The sword light descended and destroyed everything.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Blood splattered and a head flew far away. At the same time, sword Qi seeped out and killed the man’s spiritual God.</p><p>With this delay, the other two had already flown a long distance away.</p><p>“Don’t even think about leaving, go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand, and the blood-red sword in his hand turned into a ray of blood-red light, rapidly charging toward a fifth level spiritual God Realm expert. As for Lu Ming himself, he executed the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps and chased after the remaining sixth level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was like a stream of light. In just a few breaths, he had caught up with the other party.</p><p>“Lu Ming, if you kill us, you’re going to die too! The Supreme martial artists of the heaven martial sword faction are all here! You can’t run!”</p><p>The man roared, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>He performed the blood Meridian fusion and turned it into a combat sword. He wanted to fight to the death. Even if he died, he wanted to make Lu Ming pay a price. Unfortunately, his plan was destined to fail.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Ever since the prison-guarding stele’s bloodline had merged with the real one, the power of his prison-guarding heavenly skill had increased significantly.</p><p>When he used the same amount of true energy and the same level of the prison suppressing heavenly art, his power was much stronger than before.</p><p>In addition to the eight streams of dragon energy, Lu Ming’s strength was truly terrifying. He was much stronger than when he fought against the various prodigies in the holy city.</p><p>Now, if he were to face Dark Child again, Lu Ming was confident that he could defeat him in a few moves.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The palm suppressed everything as if it had infinite power. It pressed through the sky and slashed at the combat sword that the person had transformed into.</p><p>With a palm, the combat sword was shattered into pieces. It turned back into a human figure and coughed up blood.</p><p>After the second palm strike, the man’s body was torn into pieces.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blood-red sword gleam flew over and hovered above Lu Ming’s head again, turning into a drop of blood.</p><p>It was obvious that the fifth level spiritual God Realm martial artist had also been killed by the blood-red combat sword.</p><p>The five experts of the heavenly Sword faction had been completely annihilated.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the air as Xie Luan appeared. He looked at Lu Ming in surprise and asked,”Your battle prowess is not bad. I never thought that after 30000 years, a chosen like you would be born. If we were in the same life, you would definitely be my opponent!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength surprised even Xie Luan.</p><p>Even someone as proud as him had said that Lu Ming could be his opponent if they were in the same lifetime. One must know that Xie Luan had never said such words to anyone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
