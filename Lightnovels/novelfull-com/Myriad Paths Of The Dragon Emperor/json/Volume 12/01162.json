He took a few steps forward and approached Lu Ming rapidly. The aura on his body grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A soft whip appeared in his hand. It was covered with hooks and glinted coldly under the sunlight. With a wave of his hand, the soft whip grew rapidly until it was more than ten miles long. Like a venomous snake, it rolled towards Lu Ming.</p><p>The soft whip cut through the air, making an ear-piercing sound, and a hideous crack appeared in the space.</p><p>In the face of such an attack, Lu Ming’s expression was calm. His body swayed slightly and he dodged the attack. He stepped forward and charged toward venerable Xu.</p><p>you can’t escape. Inescapable net, ten thousand heavy kill!</p><p>Venerable Xu bellowed as he lashed out with his soft whip. Like a real Dragon circling in the air, it transformed into layers of whip shadows that wrapped around Lu Ming like an inescapable net, sealing off all his escape routes.</p><p>“Why would I need to escape? Just break it!”</p><p>A calm voice rang out. From within Lu Ming’s body, a Dragon’s Roar could be heard. His essential core boiled as he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This punch seemed to push the entire space forward, causing it to explode. A terrifying fist force rushed towards the heavy whip shadows. Those whip shadows collapsed instantly, turning into fragments that scattered in all directions, just like a broken tree branch.</p><p>The terrifying power even followed the soft whip and rushed towards venerable Xu. His expression changed greatly, and his body trembled as he retreated.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure flashed and suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Venerable Xu’s heart trembled and he subconsciously threw a punch. He wanted to retreat, but it was too late.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Once again, Lu Ming threw a punch as fast as lightning. It hit venerable Xu’s chest.</p><p>arghh! venerable Xu screamed in despair as his entire body exploded. Even his spiritual God wasn’t spared.</p><p>The devouring power burst out and enveloped venerable Xu. His essence, energy, and spirit were all devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>your Lackey is dead. Aren’t you going to fight personally? ”</p><p>Lu Ming was cold and indifferent as he looked at Xie Zhen with disdain.</p><p>This made Xie Zhen grit his teeth, but in his heart, he was also extremely shocked.</p><p>An expert at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm was actually killed by Lu Ming so easily. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying, right?</p><p>The expressions of the other spectators also changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming’s abilities have improved greatly since the million-year sacrificial ceremony. Such shocking talent is rare!</p><p>Xie nianjun is no match for him now. I wonder how he’ll fare against Long Chen.</p><p>I don’t know, but it’s a pity. No matter how talented Lu Ming is, no matter how powerful he is, the result is already set. Don’t forget, this is the holy city. Even if an Emperor came, he might not be able to leave, let alone Lu Ming.</p><p>While many people were shocked by Lu Ming’s combat strength and talent, they also felt sorry for him. This was the holy city. No matter how strong Lu Ming was, the outcome was already decided.</p><p>“To have such cultivation and battle prowess at your age is something that has rarely been seen since ancient times. I truly admire you. If you swear a blood oath and surrender to the Imperial Xie clan, I’ll plead with the Saint-Emperor and spare your life. What do you say?”</p><p>A white-haired old man stepped into the air and walked toward Lu Ming, looking like a Sage.</p><p>His body emitted a terrifying aura that was several times stronger than that of venerable Xu.</p><p>Peak eighth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>There was a glint in Lu Ming’s eyes. The white-haired old man did not hide his cultivation at all. Lu Ming could tell at a glance.</p><p>“You’re only at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm. Do you have the right to ask the sage Emperor to spare me? You really think too highly of yourself!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips casually and said in disdain.</p><p>“This is at least a chance, isn’t it? If you refuse, you won’t even stand a chance!”</p><p>Being looked down upon by Lu Ming, a sharp glint flashed in the white-haired elder’s eyes as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p>“Hehe, just you? I’m afraid he’s not qualified!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, his disdain growing.</p><p>how arrogant! You won’t stand a chance if I attack!</p><p>The white-haired old man’s eyes were filled with anger. His body emitted a milky white light and his eyes were cold.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had easily killed a seventh level spiritual God expert, he was at the peak of the eighth level spiritual God Realm. He was much stronger than a seventh level spiritual God and could easily kill a seventh level spiritual God expert. Therefore, he was confident that he could suppress Lu Ming.</p><p>After all, Lu Ming was young. No matter how strong he was, it would not be too outrageous!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A beam of white sword light bloomed from the white-haired elder’s hand, piercing through the vast sky and heading toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This sword was sharp, ruthless, stunning, and terrifying.</p><p>With just one strike, he was already stronger than venerable Xu, who was at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded from within Lu Ming’s body. The third bloodline emerged on top of his head, and a surge of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, causing his strength to increase explosively.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He took a step forward and struck out with his palm.</p><p>The power of the palm was shocking. It broke through the sky and formed a terrifying palm blade that slashed at the old man’s white sword light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>There was a sharp explosion and the White sword gleam dissipated. Lu Ming rushed toward the old man.</p><p>The old man’s expression changed slightly. The long sword in his hand was constantly thrust out, and streams of snow-white sword light, like brilliant crystal lights, were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The sword gleams were dense and endless as they poured toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists and continued to bombard them.</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist seemed to have turned into a prison-suppressing stele that suppressed everything.</p><p>A series of explosions rang out in the sky. The white-haired elder’s sword gleams were continuously being destroyed. Lu Ming charged up against the sword gleams and charged towards the elder.</p><p>The white-haired elder’s expression changed. It became very ugly and very serious. With a loud shout, his bloodline appeared. He performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a milky-white combat sword.</p><p>With a shake of the combat sword, more and more sharp sword gleams poured toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The nine Dragons emerged. Lu Ming transformed into the nine Dragons and rushed up, breaking all the sword gleams. The claws of the nine Dragons grabbed the milky-white combat sword continuously.</p><p>The milky white sword shook violently and then collapsed, revealing the white-haired old man’s true body.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired elder was in a sorry state. He no longer had the sage-like demeanor he had before. His hair was disheveled, his clothes were ragged, and his white robe was covered in blood. His eyes were filled with fear as he desperately rushed towards the city walls of the sacred city.</p><p>At this moment, in the sacred city, countless people who saw this scene took in a deep breath and were extremely shocked.</p><p>Even an expert at the peak of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm had been defeated. He was seriously injured by Lu Ming and had to flee for his life in a sorry state.</p><p>This was simply too unbelievable. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn’t have believed it.</p><p>A youth who was not even thirty years old was able to severely injure an old expert at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm. Such an example was rarely recorded in the divine wilderness continent since ancient times.</p><p>This had already exceeded common sense and was too terrifying.</p><p>Now, many people were suspicious whether long Chen, who was known as the world’s number one, was still a match for Lu Ming.</p><p>In the sky, Xie nianjun, who was fighting with Xie nianqing, naturally sensed this scene. His heart trembled and his eyes revealed a look of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat ability had far surpassed her.</p><p>As proud as she was, she found it hard to accept.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
