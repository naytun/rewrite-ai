In addition, Lu Ming had borrowed more power from the third bloodline. With a full-force attack, he had injured Xie Xie.</p><p>Then, the nine Dragons let out a long roar and collapsed. However, in the light of the collapse of the nine Dragons, a huge stone tablet rushed out and bloomed with light.</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele!</p><p>As soon as the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was unleashed, it grew rapidly to the size of a mountain. The prison-suppressing stele was also filled with a thick blood-red light, which pressed down on Xie Yan with an immense force.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Xie Xie shrieked in fear as he felt the terrifying killing intent and all-suppressing aura from the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At the side, the other three experts shouted and rushed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care and continued to suppress Xie Xie.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xie Xie roared and used all his strength to resist. However, his current injuries had greatly reduced his combat strength, so how could he resist?</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>As the prison-suppressing stele pressed down, Xie Xie spat out a mouthful of blood. The blood vessels in his body burst, and in the next moment, his entire body exploded with a bang.</p><p>Xie Xie, a seventh level spiritual God Realm expert, was killed by Lu Ming on the spot.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At the same time, the other three attacks hit the prison-suppressing stele at the same time, sending it flying. It shook violently and almost collapsed.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook and Lu Ming’s cold and emotionless voice kept coming out of it. The blood-red light filled the air.</p><p>“We can’t let this kid Live!”</p><p>An elder in the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm spoke, his heart filled with shock.</p><p>A third level spiritual God Realm martial artist was actually able to kill a seventh level spiritual God Realm expert. It was too shocking and he had never heard of it.</p><p>He felt a chill in his heart and was filled with the desire to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Two of them were at the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, while the other was at the seventh level. Their bodies emitted a terrifying aura that locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“All of you will die today!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He wanted to borrow more power from the third bloodline to kill these people.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you can’t continue to borrow the power of your bloodline. Otherwise, it’ll be difficult for you to maintain your consciousness!”</p><p>Dandan shouted.</p><p>“Kill, these people must be killed!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. At this moment, there was only a trace of clarity left in his mind. It was as if he would be devoured and drowned by endless killing intent at any moment.</p><p>However, it was obviously not enough to kill an eighth level spiritual God. He needed to borrow more power. However, once he borrowed more power, it would be difficult for Lu Ming to maintain the peace in his heart. He would definitely be devoured by the endless killing intent.</p><p>But at this point, was there any other way?</p><p>Lu Ming could only risk his life!</p><p>“Forget it, forget it. I’ll risk my life for once. Boy, there’s no need to continue borrowing power!”</p><p>Dandan heaved long sighs and flew away from Lu Ming toward the three experts.</p><p>you three brats, you can die without regrets if you can witness my true power today!</p><p>Dandan said. At this moment, her body emitted a brilliant light, and a terrifying aura emanated from her body.</p><p>This aura was high and mighty, as if it was the master of the world, overlooking the endless lives of the world. It also seemed like the entire world. He was the world, and the world was him.</p><p>In the light, dandan’s body grew at a terrifying speed. Finally, it turned into a divine turtle that was as tall as the sky and larger than a mountain.</p><p>“This … This is …”</p><p>The three old men were shocked. They felt a fatal threat from the giant divine turtle.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>attack! a voice came out of the giant divine turtle’s mouth. The giant turtle grabbed at the seventh level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>The seventh level spiritual God Realm expert wanted to Dodge, but he realized that he couldn’t move his body. He was imprisoned there, as if he was locked in a world.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>die! he roared. He watched as the huge claw slammed down and his entire body exploded.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>The remaining two eighth level spiritual God Realm experts roared in horror. They wanted to escape, but their bodies seemed to have sunk into quagmire, and it was extremely difficult for them to move.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>kill! the giant tortoise spat out the word. Two beams of light shot out from its mouth and pierced through the two elders in the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm, killing them.</p><p>The two eighth level spiritual God Realm experts had died just like that.</p><p>Even though Lu Ming was filled with endless killing intent, he was still dumbfounded.</p><p>After killing the three experts, the giant turtle rapidly shrank and turned back into a small turtle. It lay in the air weakly and shouted, ” what a loss, what a loss. I’ve accumulated so much energy for so long and it’s almost all used up in a short while. Lu Ming, you must stay with me, stay with me!</p><p>Dandan shouted and floated weakly to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind barely had a trace of clarity. At this moment, he waved his hand and stored dandan and the two eighth level spiritual God Realm experts ‘corpses into the mountain and river diagram. His body moved and he left the place.</p><p>The great disturbance here would definitely alert the experts in the city, so they had to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of blood-red light and traversed the vast land. Soon, he appeared a million miles away. He found a hidden place and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>As soon as he entered the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. He closed his eyes and tried his best to resist the endless killing intent.</p><p>The endless killing intent seemed to be able to drown Lu Ming at any time, turning him into a killing machine.</p><p>The blood light on his body was shining, but slowly, it faded back into the third bloodline.</p><p>He sat there for half a month.</p><p>Half a month later, the power of the third bloodline was completely retracted into the third bloodline and back to Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>At the same time, he dispelled the endless killing intent in his heart.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming finally opened his eyes. There was no longer any killing intent in his eyes, only clarity.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief. It was really a close call this time. He was almost devoured by the killing intent in the third bloodline.</p><p>The third bloodline was a double-edged sword. One had to be extremely careful when using it. If one’s cultivation wasn’t high enough and they borrowed too much power, they would be drowned in endless killing intent.</p><p>This time, it was fortunate that dandan had made a move at the end. Otherwise, he would have to borrow even more power. If that had happened, Lu Ming would very likely have been drowned by endless killing intent and become a killing puppet.</p><p>At the thought of dandan, Lu Ming looked to the side and happened to see dandan lying there, gnawing on a stalk of spiritual medicine, looking very weak.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had woken up, dandan’s back claw kicked and landed on Lu Ming’s shoulder, shouting, ” “Lu Ming, I’ve suffered a great loss this time. I’ve lost a lot of vitality. You have to give me the spirit herbs. Otherwise, I won’t let you off!”</p><p>“Alright, in the future, as long as I don’t need any spirit herbs, I’ll give them to you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He waved his hand and a pile of spiritual herbs appeared.</p><p>Dandan’s eyes lit up, and she swallowed all the spirit herbs in one gulp, leaving them behind to eat slowly.</p><p>“Brat, at least you still have some conscience!”</p><p>Dandan muttered a few words, and then put on a smug look and said, ” “How is it? I’m invincible, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
