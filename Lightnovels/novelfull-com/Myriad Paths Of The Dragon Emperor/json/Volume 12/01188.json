This time, it was only for the younger generation. The older ones had no hope.</p><p>However, some of the younger generation’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Excuse me, when do we start?”</p><p>Xie Sheng asked.</p><p>after ten days, let’s wait here for ten days. After ten days, the elites of the divine wilderness continent who wish to participate will gather here. However, I have to make it clear first that the requirements for the major sects of the yuan continent to recruit disciples are very high. Only the top elites can be selected. Hence, after ten days, I will conduct a test. Only those who pass will be able to follow me to the divine Ruins continent to participate in the selection of the tianshen sect!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Naturally!”</p><p>Xie Sheng nodded.</p><p>“Alright, spread the news!”</p><p>The black-robed man waved his hand and boarded the warship.</p><p>The people on the warship had also disappeared. The warship floated quietly in the air.</p><p>The battle between the royal family and the heaven suppressing divine Legion naturally came to a stop. The news that the gate of God had arrived and that a large sect in the yuan continent was about to recruit disciples spread like wildfire across the divine wilderness.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie Luan had also returned to the demon God Valley.</p><p>Xie Luan, Lu Ming, qu Luo, and the others were gathered in a Hall in the demon God Valley.</p><p>When qu Luo and the others found out the purpose of the people from the continent of the divine Ruins, they were all shocked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I think this is your chance. A great chance!”</p><p>Xie Luan was the first to speak.</p><p>“Senior Xie’s meaning is for me to participate in the selection?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. Your talent is rare even in the divine wilderness. There’s a high chance that you will be chosen by the tianshen sect to become a disciple of a major sect in the yuan continent. Miss nianqing also has a chance!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly and fell into deep thought.</p><p>To be honest, he was also very tempted. This was a great opportunity.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current goal was no longer to become a Martial Emperor. His goal was to climb to a higher realm.</p><p>But in the divine wilderness continent, once one reached the Emperor realm, it was very difficult to improve. To continue improving, one had to leave the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>However, when he broke through to the sovereign level and left for the yuan continent alone, it would be a long journey and it would not be easy to join a large sect.</p><p>Now was undoubtedly a very good opportunity.</p><p>However, there was still something he could not let go of, which was Martial Emperor Di Yi. If he did not solve Martial Emperor Di Yi’s problem, he could not leave in peace and go to the yuan continent to cultivate.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you worried about Di Yi?”</p><p>Xie Luan seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind and asked.</p><p>“That’s right. If I don’t deal with this person, I won’t be at ease!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming, you are too short-sighted. Think about it, even if you are chosen by the tianshen sect, you may not have to go to the yuan continent to cultivate immediately. If you want to wait for a while before going, you can probably do it.</p><p>even if it can’t be delayed, once you are chosen by the tianshen sect, it is a big sect in the yuan continent with many strong people. Any one of them can destroy Di Yi. Then, you can Ask a Master to kill Di Yi and everything will be solved!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>That’s right. If he really joined the tianshen sect and became a disciple, it wouldn’t be too difficult to ask the tianshen sect to send anyone to kill Di Yi.</p><p>As long as he could get rid of Di Yi, he would not have to worry about the divine wilderness continent. He could go to the yuan continent to cultivate in peace.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll participate in the Tian Shen sect’s selection!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>“Little Qing, what about you?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Wherever you go, I’ll naturally follow!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll set off in a few days!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>……</p><p>When the news of a large sect recruiting disciples spread, the entire divine wilderness continent was in a state of shock.</p><p>All the Overlord forces stopped fighting each other. Many Young heaven’s pride experts started to move and rush to the earth core Lake.</p><p>Geniuses from the eastern wastelands, Southern netherworld, and Western Desert were all gathering at the core Lake.</p><p>Very quickly, ten days were almost up.</p><p>Xie Luan brought Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, Tuoba Shi, and the other elites of Northern Plains to the earth core Lake.</p><p>The warship from the divine Ruins continent was still hovering above the earth core Lake.</p><p>The four sides of the warship were already surrounded by people. They were all experts from various major forces, and they had arrived with their respective heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Of course, there were still many people who came to watch the show. It could be said that it was a gathering of experts.</p><p>Everyone waited quietly. Not long after, the warship glowed, and a group of people appeared at the bow of the warship. The person in the lead was the black-clothed middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man in Black stepped out and flew off the warship. Behind him were two young men. They were obviously from the younger generation.</p><p>Of the two young men, one of them had a smile on his face and looked very gentle. The other had a cold and arrogant look on his face. His gaze swept across the people from the divine wilderness continent with a hint of disdain.</p><p>“The younger generation, step forward!”</p><p>The voice of the black-robed man rang out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>One figure after another flew forward and arrived in front of the black-robed middle-aged man and the others.</p><p>There were thousands of them.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man frowned and said coldly, ” those below the spiritual god level, leave. You want to participate in the selection of the major sects of the yuan continent with such a cultivation? ”</p><p>Hearing this, most of the young men looked helpless and could only step back.</p><p>Instantly, there were only a few dozen people left on the field.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and realized that almost all the elites of the divine wilderness continent were here.</p><p>Long Chen, Xie nianjun, yang potian, Shi du, and the others.</p><p>Dark Child of the southern underworld, three-headed hell hound, and the others. Other than the heartless monk and the female Bodhisattva of the Western Desert, there were also five more Young heaven’s favorites. It was truly shocking. Everyone sighed at how powerful the Western Desert was.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming only saw the Emperor God in the East barren.</p><p>Obviously, other than the Emperor God, no one else had reached the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Some of them, such as Shi du, Wu chengkong, and di Shen, cast cold gazes at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Emperor God!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept over di Shen, and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Di Yi still wanted to take him down. If there was a chance, Lu Ming would definitely get rid of di Shen and collect some interest.</p><p>Behind the middle-aged man in Black, the two young men were also sizing up Lu Ming and the rest. The young man with a smile on his face was still smiling, and there was no change in his expression.</p><p>However, the cold and arrogant young man’s eyes were burning with a fiery light.</p><p>His gaze swept across Xie nianjun, Xie nianqing, goddess Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, and the others, and the fire in his eyes burned even more intensely.</p><p>who would have thought that there would be so many stunning beauties in the tiny divine wilderness continent, hehe!</p><p>The arrogant youth’s lips curled up as his heart burned.</p><p>all right, your cultivation has reached the spiritual God Realm, but I still have to screen you. Unless you’re a top heaven’s pride expert, ordinary heaven’s pride experts will only embarrass themselves if they go!</p><p>“Now, all of you stand still. I’ll test your bloodline!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s gaze swept across Lu Ming and the rest. Then, a formation disk appeared in his hand. The formation disk glowed and flew into the sky, rapidly expanding.</p><p>In the end, a beam of light appeared and enveloped Lu Ming and the rest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
