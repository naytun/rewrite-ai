The commander is mighty!</p><p>...</p><p>“The mighty commander Ming!”</p><p>……</p><p>In the beginning, it was tie Xing and the others who were shouting. Later on, the other law enforcement soldiers of the law enforcement Hall also started to shout.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his hands and everyone quieted down.</p><p>brothers of the law enforcement Army, I thank you for your help this time!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>The appearance of the nine law enforcement flags was also a form of deterrence.</p><p>commander Ming, you’re too kind. It’s you who let our law enforcement Army hold our heads high and let out the breath of suffocation in our hearts. We should be the ones thanking you!</p><p>“That’s right, we should thank you!”</p><p>The others chimed in.</p><p>everyone is too polite. Since everyone is here today, I will treat everyone. Let’s have a good time. Tie Xing, bring some brothers and go buy some wine and food!</p><p>Lu Ming took out some rough stones and handed them to tie Xing.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Tie Xing took the raw stone and brought a few people out in a hurry.</p><p>At this time, the crowd in the sky also dispersed one by one. Not long after, all of them had left.</p><p>But today’s events spread like a storm.</p><p>This time, it wasn’t the same as the Huang family’s matter last time. Last time, the Huang family only attracted a few people’s attention and became a topic of discussion after tea and meals.</p><p>This time, it was against the Overlord faction, the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>Naturally, it caused a commotion.</p><p>As for the awesome commander Minglu, his reputation was so great that some people even judged him as the most awesome commander of the law enforcement Army in 30000 years.</p><p>Soon, tie Xing bought a large amount of food and wine. A banquet was held in the law enforcement Hall, and there were more than a thousand law enforcement soldiers drinking and chatting in the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>They only left late at night.</p><p>tie Xing, there are 500000 raw stones here. Take them and share them with your brothers!</p><p>After the rest of the law enforcement Hall’s people left, Lu Ming took out a storage ring and handed it to tie Xing.</p><p>commander, you can’t do that. You risked your life to get these. We didn’t make any contributions!</p><p>Tie Xing waved his hands.</p><p>The others also shook their heads. Although they were poor, they were still people with principles.</p><p>take it. If you guys didn’t support me from behind, the people of the heavenly martial sword faction wouldn’t be afraid of us. Take it and split it!</p><p>Lu Ming passed the storage ring to tie Xing and returned to his room alone. He closed the door and entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a huge pile of raw gemstones appeared before his eyes.</p><p>It was a total of three million.</p><p>it’s time to break through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>With a thought, the bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. He opened his mouth and swallowed one hundred thousand raw gemstones. He began to refine them.</p><p>As the raw gemstones were refined continuously, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was increasing rapidly.</p><p>Late-stage second level spiritual God Realm, peak second level spiritual God Realm, and he began to strive for the third level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Three days passed by in a flash.</p><p>After refining all three million orirocks, the essential core in Lu Ming’s body surged unceasingly, as if there were countless true dragons roaring in his body. It took a moment before it slowly calmed down.</p><p>I’ve finally reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm. However, I’ve also used up all three million raw stones!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes, and there was a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>The consumption was huge, but so were the gains.</p><p>In just three short days, Lu Ming’s cultivation had advanced from the middle second level spiritual God Realm to the early third level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had increased by a large margin.</p><p>Lu Ming was more confident about the competition that would take place more than ten days later.</p><p>it’s been almost two years since Martial Emperor Di Yi sealed the talisman Amulet sect. The talisman Amulet sect can only hold on for five years. There are only a little more than three years left. Can I fight against Di Yi by then? ”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the talisman Amulet sect. At the thought of this, he felt very stressed.</p><p>It was too difficult to reach the level where he could fight against Di Yi in the remaining three years. It was almost impossible according to Lu Ming’s current progress.</p><p>He shook his head. It was useless to think too much. Lu Ming could only push forward with all his might and do his best.</p><p>He stretched his back lazily. His bone Xun vibrated and a series of crackling sounds came from his body. Lu Ming stood up and walked out.</p><p>In the days that followed, Lu Ming returned to his previous calm.</p><p>Other than cultivating every day, he would go around the holy city.</p><p>Ever since the incident at the heavenly martial sword faction, the disciples of the various Overlord forces had become more obedient in the holy city, especially in the areas under Lu Ming’s jurisdiction. They did not dare to attack others for no reason.</p><p>Even if there were grudges, it would be on the stage to determine who was stronger.</p><p>Lu Ming’s days were rather carefree.</p><p>Very quickly, ten days had passed. The one-million-year National ceremony of the ancient Saint dynasty was about to begin.</p><p>During this period of time, the holy city was unusually lively. Lu Ming could see powerhouses from all over the world as he walked on the streets.</p><p>Northern Plains ‘martial artists were all tall and sturdy, even the females were mostly tall, the weapons they used were either maces, huge hammers, or giant axes, they were all heavy weapons with wild auras, they rode on all kinds of mounts and were easy to recognize.</p><p>There were also some martial artists who had gloomy auras, either filled with ghost Qi or blood Qi. Anyone who passed by them would give people a cold feeling.</p><p>These were all martialists from the southern underworld.</p><p>There were also some monks in kasayas with bright heads. They were obviously Holy monks from the Western Desert.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming did not meet many people from the East barren.</p><p>……</p><p>On this day, the million-year sacrificial ceremony of the ancient Saint dynasty had finally begun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A buzzing sound could be heard in the sky, along with intense fluctuations.</p><p>Lu Ming, tie Xing, and the rest walked out of the law enforcement Hall and flew into the air to watch.</p><p>In the sky above the sacred city, colorful clouds filled the air and heavenly music played. The space was constantly distorted in the colorful light.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Finally, a huge platform appeared in the sky.</p><p>This platform was neither gold nor Jade. It was speckled with multicolored light, with true dragons and phoenixes dancing in the air, and divine beasts like Qilin strolling. Of course, it couldn’t be real, but was formed by a formation.</p><p>Then, tables and chairs appeared on the East and West sides of the platform.</p><p>The tables and chairs were made of fine jade, with dragon and phoenix patterns carved on them. They were extremely luxurious, and there were a lot of them. At a glance, there were more than ten thousand of them.</p><p>All of them were floating in the air above the sacred city.</p><p>After the tables and chairs on the East and West sides appeared, a Jade staircase appeared in the North. There were ninety-nine steps, and they slanted upwards. At the end of the steps, a huge ancient altar appeared.</p><p>The altar was ancient and heavy, as if it had gone through the vicissitudes of time. It was 10000 meters high and disappeared into the clouds.</p><p>“The sage-Emperor has descended!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice came from the palace. The voice rolled and spread throughout the entire sacred city.</p><p>Heavenly music filled the palace as holy light filled the air and soared into the sky.</p><p>Then, a group of people stepped into the air.</p><p>The man at the front was wearing a golden robe embroidered with the pattern of the human King patrolling the world. He looked to be in his fifties. He had a tall and sturdy figure, and his body was surrounded by a holy light. His eyes were full of stars, and he was full of Majesty.</p><p>This was Xie Qitian, the current Saint Emperor, a terrifying existence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
