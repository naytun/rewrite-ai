Bang! Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>Then Xie Luan kept hitting the fragments of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>After thirty-six consecutive slaps, the fragment of the prison-guarding stele flew back to Lu Ming and hovered above his head.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully and realized that Xie Luan had completely broken away from the suppression of the prison suppressing stele fragment. He was completely free.</p><p>Xie Luan had said before that he could only break free from the prison-suppressing stele fragment’s suppression after recovering to the Emperor realm.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Xie Luan let out a long breath, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>He had been suppressed by the prison-suppressing stele for 30000 years and had finally escaped.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie Luan and did not say anything.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan was also looking at Lu Ming. Their eyes met, and each of them had their own thoughts.</p><p>After a while, Xie Luan was the first to speak, ” “Lu Ming, how about we form an alliance?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little stunned.</p><p>Now that Xie Luan had completely escaped the influence of the prison defending monument fragment, Lu Ming had thought of many things that Xie Luan would say. He had even considered turning hostile and not recognizing him. However, he had never expected that Xie Luan would actually want to form an alliance with him?</p><p>Xie Luan was a man who had dominated the world. His cultivation had already recovered to the Emperor realm, and he had powerful subordinates like Mo Ye. He was extremely powerful.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. Why would Xie Luan need to form an alliance with him?</p><p>What did an Alliance mean? It meant that both sides were equal and on equal footing!</p><p>Lu Ming could not figure it out.</p><p>At this moment, countless thoughts ran through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I know you’re very surprised. To be honest, with your current ability, you’re not qualified to form an alliance with me. However, your talent is something I’ve never seen before. In the future, I might need your help!”</p><p>Xie Luan seemed to have read Lu Ming’s mind and explained.</p><p>“What are your specific conditions?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>To be honest, he was also very tempted to form an alliance with Xie Lun.</p><p>He was still weak. Even if the talisman Amulet sect was not trapped, they did not have an Emperor to protect them. It would be difficult for them to fight against the Overlord forces. He really needed strong help.</p><p>If he could truly form an alliance with Xie Luan and stand on equal footing without being restricted by Xie Luan, it would be a good choice.</p><p>my conditions are very simple. I have my eyes on your future. With your talent, it is a hundred percent certain that you will become an Emperor. It might not even be too difficult for you to surpass me in the future. With your talent, the divine wilderness continent is not your end. In the future, you will most likely step out of the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>my condition is that if you step out of the divine wilderness continent in the future and join a major power in the yuan continent, you have to think of a way to make me join that major power.</p><p>Xie Luan spoke, stating his conditions.</p><p>Xie Luan’s words were very direct, and it was clear that he was interested in his future.</p><p>This was like an investment. He wanted to invest in Lu Ming.</p><p>“Cultivators should pursue the peak of martial arts and fight against the heavens!”</p><p>the Emperor lives for ten thousand years, at most twenty thousand years, before he turns into a cup of yellow soil. Only by breaking through to a higher realm can he fight for more longevity. It’s said that Saints can live for a hundred thousand years. How carefree is that? only cultivation is real, everything else is just an empty title!</p><p>it’s a pity that I’ve been suppressed for 30000 years. I’ve long passed the age of my peak. It’s impossible for me to join a major power like the yuan continent!</p><p>Xie Luan sighed, his eyes filled with yearning.</p><p>The peak of martial arts and a longer lifespan were the lifelong goals of every cultivator.</p><p>Lu Ming could hear the helplessness in Xie Luan’s words.</p><p>Originally, with Xie Luan’s talent, if he hadn’t been suppressed for 30000 years, he could have joined a major power in the yuan continent. But now, it was impossible. He needed help.</p><p>Therefore, he proposed such a condition to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s talent was higher than his in the past.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this is my condition. If you agree to it, we’ll form an alliance and be on equal footing. My force is yours. I can help you deal with strong enemies. I’m sure you’ve offended many strong enemies along the way!”</p><p>Xie Luan stared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Alright, I promise you!”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>Xie Luan had made it very clear. In fact, this was an exchange of interests. Sometimes, Lu Ming was more willing to believe in an exchange of interests. This was more real.</p><p>Lu Ming did not believe that Xie lie had agreed to form an alliance with him to thank him for saving his life.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie Luan was overjoyed. He waved his hand in the air, and a complex blood-colored inscription pattern appeared.</p><p>“I’ll make a blood oath now to form an alliance with you, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie Luan was very decisive. He immediately took a blood oath to form an alliance with Lu Ming.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming also discovered the blood oath.</p><p>“Haha, all of you, come over!”</p><p>Xie Luan turned to Mo Ye and the others.</p><p>Mo Ye and the rest flew over.</p><p>as you can see, Lu Ming and I have formed an alliance and are on equal footing. I declare that from now on, Lu Ming and I will be the Supreme Commander. He will have the same authority as me. In the future, when you see him, it will be the same as seeing me. Do you understand? ”</p><p>Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>“Your subordinate understands!”</p><p>Although Mo Ye and the rest had a thousand questions in their hearts, they could only nod.</p><p>Was this young man’s talent really higher than The Fiend ancestor’s?</p><p>Mo Ye and the rest found it hard to believe.</p><p>“Mo Ye, during this period of time, you’ve sent people to gather information about the outside world. How’s the situation in the central continent now?”</p><p>Xie Luan asked.</p><p>it’s chaotic. The outside world is in chaos …</p><p>Immediately, Mo Ye began to introduce the information he had gathered during this period of time.</p><p>Ever since Xie Luan had taken out the Heavenly King token in the sacred city, a battle between the emperors had begun.</p><p>The death of Wu Jue and Wu Huang shocked the world.</p><p>After that, the emperors of the central continent’s various Overlord forces all moved out and gathered in the sacred city, wanting to fight for the Heavenly King token.</p><p>In the end, the royal family was pressured to hand over the Heavenly King token. This resulted in an earth-shattering war between the emperors.</p><p>That battle could be said to be the most intense and brutal battle since Xie Luan’s rebellion thirty thousand years ago.</p><p>There were more than 20 sovereigns in the battle, and it was a terrifying battle.</p><p>Many emperors were injured in that battle, and two of them even died on the spot.</p><p>In the end, the Heavenly King’s token fell into the hands of the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>After this battle, central continent was in complete chaos.</p><p>First, the royal family, the Xie family, gathered their allies and sent out a great army to attack the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the heaven suppressing divine Army also United with its allies and mobilized the Army to fight against the royal family.</p><p>The other Overlord forces that did not participate in the fight between the two forces also began to attack each other.</p><p>In the past, although there was constant friction between the major forces, it was still controlled on a small scale and a delicate balance was maintained.</p><p>However, the battle for the Heavenly King token had completely broken the balance.</p><p>The royal family and the Xie family were fighting against each other, and the remaining Overlord forces also took the opportunity to expand their strength.</p><p>Almost all the forces in the central continent were involved.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
