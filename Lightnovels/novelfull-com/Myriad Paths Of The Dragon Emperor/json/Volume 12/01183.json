There were nine blood essences in the bottle that looked like blood diamonds.</p><p>...</p><p>This was the blood essence of a Supreme martial artist!</p><p>It had been seven days since the hundred beasts tribe surrendered.</p><p>In seven days, almost everything had been arranged. Moreover, the demonic Qi in the demon God Valley was abundant, which was conducive to Xie nianqing’s cultivation. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing came to the demon God Valley to guard it, while Xie Luan led a group of people to guard the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had already linked the talisman Amulet sect’s inter-territory teleportation formation with the teleportation formations of the major forces in Northern Plains. Now, the talisman Amulet sect could move freely and could teleport to Northern Plains at any time.</p><p>These few days, many people from talisman sect had been sent to Northern Plains for training and tempering.</p><p>After making all the arrangements, Lu Ming planned to start his closed-door cultivation.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons emerged. It opened its mouth and sucked in a drop of Supreme blood essence. Then, it began to refine it.</p><p>It would be much easier to devour a drop of Supreme blood essence, unlike the last time when he almost burst his nine Dragon bloodline.</p><p>A few hours later, a drop of Supreme-being blood essence was refined. Lu Ming continued to devour another drop.</p><p>One drop after another, in less than two days, all nine drops of blood essence had been refined.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons hasn’t advanced yet!</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. In total, he had refined the blood essence of two Supremes, some perfected spiritual God, ninth tier, and eighth tier spiritual God, but his nine Dragon bloodline had not improved.</p><p>The difficulty of raising one’s level to divine level nine was truly too astonishing.</p><p>The eight golden Chakra Rings around the nine Dragon bloodline shone brilliantly. Lu Ming could feel that he was getting closer and closer to the ninth level divine level bloodline.</p><p>“I don’t believe it, continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming took out another Jade bottle. There were still nine drops of Supreme blood essence in it.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to refine.</p><p>……</p><p>In the tallest stone tower in the hundred beasts tribe, Xie Luan sat on the top, and below him sat the two sovereigns, qu Luo and Mo Ye.</p><p>“Ancestor devil, Lu Ming’s influence is getting bigger and bigger. The Barbarian Emperor of the hundred beasts tribe has directly said that he will only surrender to Lu Ming and obey his orders. In addition, he has allied with the floating mountain sect and the talisman Amulet sect. The future is not good for us!”</p><p>Qu Luo said to Xie Luan.</p><p>that’s right. Furthermore, Lu Ming has shocking talent and is improving at an abnormal speed. I’m afraid he’ll be able to reach the Emperor realm within twenty years. Once he reaches the Emperor realm, I’m afraid it’ll affect your authority and prestige, ancestor devil!</p><p>Mo Ye also spoke.</p><p>With a smile on his face, Xie Luan raised his wine cup and slowly sipped.</p><p>After qu Luo and Mo Ye finished speaking, Xie Luan smiled faintly and said, ” “Your vision is still too narrow, too short-sighted!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Qu Luo and Mo Ye were both stunned and confused.</p><p>Mo Ye, as you all know, Lu Ming has unparalleled talent. In the history of the divine wilderness continent, he is rarely seen. With such talent, what do you think his future will be like? ”</p><p>“As long as this kid doesn’t die, his future will be unpredictable!”</p><p>Qu Luo said after a moment of thought.</p><p>Mo Ye also nodded.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming’s talent is far inferior to mine when I was young. Moreover, the most terrifying thing about him is that I can’t see through him at all!</p><p>this child’s first bloodline is the nine Dragons bloodline. It’s needless to say that it’s one of the legendary top ten Battle Beasts with endless potential!</p><p>but this kid’s second bloodline is even more amazing. It’s the prison-guarding stele. You might not have heard of it, but I’ve read about it in an ancient book overseas. It seems to have a shocking background!</p><p>I can’t see through this kid’s third bloodline at all. I don’t have a clue at all. However, I feel that it’s unfathomable. It’s as if there’s an unimaginable and extraordinary power hidden within!</p><p>that’s why I formed an alliance with him. If he goes to the yuan continent in the future, there is a high possibility that he will join those big sects. Then, in the future, he will probably recommend us to join those big sects.</p><p>you are all emperors. When you pursue higher realms, you must look far ahead!</p><p>Xie Luan explained his thoughts in detail.</p><p>it’s actually so shocking. The Fiend ancestor’s vision is far beyond us!</p><p>Quluo and Mo Ye’s eyes were filled with shock after hearing this.</p><p>They only knew that Lu Ming was very talented, but he did not have as deep and far-reaching vision as Xie Lan.</p><p>If they could join a big sect in the yuan continent, it would be a fatal temptation for them.</p><p>The reason why the central continent was in chaos and the war was all because of a Heavenly King token, a token that allowed one to join the sky King Hall, a major power of the yuan continent.</p><p>“Therefore, the higher Lu Ming’s talent is, the better it is. If he can break through to the emperor’s position one day, what’s wrong with me helping him wholeheartedly? In the future, you must all wholeheartedly listen to his orders, understand?”</p><p>Xie Luan warned.</p><p>“Yes, don’t worry, fiend ancestor!”</p><p>Quluo and Mo Ye nodded.</p><p>“Yes, quluo. Return to the demon God Valley and help Lu Ming guard it!” Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>……</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming did not know about this incident. He had been refining the Supreme blood essence for several days.</p><p>Lu Ming refined the blood essence of two Supremes in a row. However, his nine Dragon bloodline still did not advance. It remained at level eight divine level.</p><p>Lu Ming had already refined the blood essence of four Supreme martial artists.</p><p>just how much Supreme blood essence is needed to advance?!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed and was somewhat speechless.</p><p>Now, he had refined all the Supreme martial artist’s blood essence in his hands.</p><p>“Forget it, I’ll slowly improve in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming was helpless. He could only put aside the matter of the blood Meridian and start to Polish his conception and condense his essential core.</p><p>After the battle at the mountain piercing sect, Lu Ming had improved a lot, especially his concepts. All five of his concepts had improved by a large margin. He needed time to slowly polish them and stabilize his Foundation.</p><p>Time flew by, and two months passed in a flash.</p><p>After spending two months, Lu Ming’s Foundation was finally completely stable and impregnable.</p><p>In the past two months, the outside world had not changed much.</p><p>Central continent was still in the midst of a huge battle, there were no signs of it stopping.</p><p>On a mountain peak in the demon God Valley, there was a stone table. Lu Ming and the Barbarian Emperor sat opposite each other.</p><p>Lu Ming was seeking guidance from the Barbarian Emperor.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor had also cultivated the earth mentality. Of course, the Barbarian Emperor had already transformed the earth mentality into the earth domain, so his comprehension of the earth mentality was naturally very profound.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor told Lu Ming everything he knew, which greatly inspired Lu Ming. He felt that it would not be long before his earth essence realm would break through.</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, senior barbarian Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his wine cup and toasted the Barbarian Emperor.</p><p>haha, you’re too kind, general Lu. It’s your comprehension that has surprised me!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor said with a smile.</p><p>As Lu Ming was the commander, the Barbarian Emperor and the others addressed him as commander Lu.</p><p>Although there was a huge age gap between the two, they got along very well. They drank and talked about martial arts.</p><p>Chi la!</p><p>At this moment, the sky suddenly split open. A huge hand reached down from the sky and grabbed at Lu Ming. The vast aura made Lu Ming and the Barbarian Emperor’s faces change.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
