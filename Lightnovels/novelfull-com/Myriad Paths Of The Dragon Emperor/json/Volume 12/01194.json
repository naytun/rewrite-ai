So that was the case.</p><p>...</p><p>As for the divine wilderness continent’s paragons, they were secretly shocked. In the four directions of the divine Ruins continent, there were a total of forty-two continents. The vast divine wilderness continent was actually just one of them. It was truly shocking.</p><p>It was said that there were many such continents in the entire primordial realm. It was simply uncountable, and it was really unknown how big the primordial realm was.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all I have to tell you. As for the details of the selection of the heavenly God sect’s disciples, I’ll tell you when the nine Continents gather. Now, we need to fly into the South God Palace!”</p><p>After the black-robed man finished speaking, he stepped out and flew out of the ship.</p><p>Mu Feng, ye Chuan, and some other people from the divine Ruins continent, including Lu Ming and the others, flew out to look at the sea-crossing spaceship.</p><p>Then, the cross-sea spaceship changed direction and flew in another direction.</p><p>They stepped on the air and flew toward the South God Palace.</p><p>The ancient city in front of them all belonged to the South God Palace. It was extremely vast, and countless people lived there.</p><p>When the guards of the ancient city saw the black-robed middle-aged man, they bowed respectfully and entered the ancient city without any obstructions.</p><p>The ancient city was really too big. It was like a small world inside, with mountains, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>Soon, they landed on a square.</p><p>“Wait here for a moment. Someone will come to arrange your accommodation soon!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said. Then, he rose into the air and disappeared.</p><p>Beside him, Mu Feng’s face was cold. He took out a Jade transmission talisman and sent a message out. Then, he sneered.</p><p>Soon, two middle-aged strong men flew over and landed in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>you must be the elites from the divine wilderness continent. Come with us, we will arrange your accommodation!</p><p>Having said that, he rose into the air, followed by Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>There were two mountain peaks not far from the square.</p><p>The two mountain peaks were connected together. There were two peaks, one tall and one short, like brother peaks.</p><p>From a distance, one could see courtyards built on the two peaks.</p><p>The two brawny men led them and flew towards the tall mountain.</p><p>In a flash, they landed on the mountain peak.</p><p>The mountain peak was filled with dense spirit Qi and origin Qi. Ancient trees towered into the sky, and spirit beasts ran around. The environment was very good. There were some courtyards built in the forest.</p><p>this mountain peak is called general peak, and that Short Mountain peak is called soldier peak. It’s as if the soldiers are paying respects to their general!</p><p>One of the brawny men introduced.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked over. Indeed, the short Mountain peak looked like a soldier paying his respects to the general.</p><p>From their side, they could see soldier peak.</p><p>you can choose any courtyard you want to stay in. Alright, I’ve brought you the location. We’ll be leaving!</p><p>A brawny man said. Then, the two brawny men left.</p><p>“I have rice hair, this little monk will choose this courtyard. Junior Sister moonless, do you want to live with me?”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk chanted the name of Buddha and walked toward a side courtyard. Before he left, he glanced at moonless and asked.</p><p>Moonless directly ignored the unscrupulous monk and entered another courtyard.</p><p>There were many courtyards here, and they could choose at will. Each of them chose their own courtyard.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing strolled around. They chose a courtyard near the cliff and walked in.</p><p>The courtyard was elegant, and there were several rooms that could accommodate several people. The environment was also elegant, and the two were quite satisfied.</p><p>……</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lu Ming and the rest had been in the South God Palace for three days.</p><p>On this day, outside the ancient city, another ship flew across the sea, and a group of people flew out.</p><p>this is the southern deity Palace of the divine Ruins continent? ”</p><p>In the crowd, there were more than a dozen young men. Their eyes were shining as they looked at the ancient city in front of them with excitement and anticipation.</p><p>After that, they flew into the ancient city and landed on the square, just like Lu Ming and the rest did previously.</p><p>Not long after, a young man and a man in his Prime flew over.</p><p>The young man was Mu Feng.</p><p>“My friends from the Shen ‘e continent, your accommodation has been arranged. Please follow us!”</p><p>Mu Feng said.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites from the Shen ‘e continent nodded. There were 15 of them, and they followed Mu Feng and the young man in a certain direction.</p><p>The direction they were heading in was also the direction where Lu Ming and the rest were staying. However, they did not reach general peak but soldier peak.</p><p>They landed on soldier peak.</p><p>brother mu, I think the scenery on that mountain peak is better. Can we stay on that mountain peak? ”</p><p>A young man from the Shen ‘e continent looked up at the general’s peak and asked.</p><p>brother E, I’m sorry. That mountain has already been occupied by a person from a continent!</p><p>Mu Feng laughed.</p><p>“There’s a continent to live in? Which continent is it?”</p><p>Not only the young man, but the other young men from the Shen ‘e continent also changed their expressions.</p><p>Soldier peak was obviously shorter than general peak, and they had to look up at it, which made them very uncomfortable.</p><p>it’s the people from the divine wilderness continent. The mountain that the divine wilderness continent lives on is called general peak, and this mountain is called soldier peak!</p><p>Mu Feng explained.</p><p>“General peak? Soldier peak? How preposterous, why did the people of the divine wilderness continent live on general peak, while we live on soldier peak? Then what right does the divine wilderness continent have to live in the general’s peak?”</p><p>I’ve heard of the divine wilderness continent. Legend has it that in ancient times, there was a ranking of the continents in the divine Ruins. The divine wilderness continent is ranked far behind my Shen ‘e continent. What right do they have to live there? ”</p><p>Mu Feng’s words caused a commotion among the heaven’s favorites from the Shen ‘e continent. They all expressed their dissatisfaction.</p><p>A General’s peak and a soldier’s peak. The meaning was obvious. Didn’t that mean that their Shen ‘e continent would be the soldiers, while the divine wilderness continent would be the generals?</p><p>Preposterous?</p><p>“Everyone, this is the arrangement of the South God Palace’s elders. It’s possible that the elders feel that the divine wilderness continent’s paragons are stronger? However, in the South God Palace, everything is decided by strength. The stronger you are, the better the place you can stay in. Alright, everyone, you can move in. This mu will take his leave first!”</p><p>After Mu Feng finished speaking, he turned around and flew away with the middle-aged man.</p><p>A smug smile appeared on Mu Feng’s face.</p><p>“Divine wilderness continent, aren’t you all very powerful? Then, I will let you have a taste of the skills of the God’s alligator continent’s heaven’s pride!”</p><p>A cold smile appeared on Mu Feng’s face.</p><p>That’s right, the arrangement of accommodation was arranged by Mu Feng through his connections. It was just a simple arrangement of accommodation, not too difficult.</p><p>He had deliberately arranged for the divine wilderness continent to be at the general’s peak, and for a rather powerful continent, the Shen ‘e continent, to be at the soldier’s peak. He wanted to stir up conflict between the two continents.</p><p>If the divine wilderness continent did not let him have it easy, he would not let the people of the divine wilderness continent have it easy either.</p><p>After Mu Feng left, the heaven’s favorites from the Shen ‘e continent shouted angrily.</p><p>just now, Mu Feng said that in the South God Palace, everything is decided by strength. The divine wilderness continent actually lives above our Shen ‘e continent. What right do they have? ”</p><p>since strength speaks for itself, then let the people of the divine wilderness continent get the hell out. The general’s peak is ours.</p><p>“Who’s going to make the first move?”</p><p>I’ll go. A mere divine wilderness continent, I alone am enough!</p><p>In the end, a young man in scale armor walked out and stepped into the air, flying toward the general peak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
