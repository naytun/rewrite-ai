He could feel waves of vast energy coming from the prison suppressing stele’s Blood Meridian.</p><p>The level of the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline did not increase. It was still at divine Level Seven. However, Lu Ming could feel that its power was very shocking. If he used the bloodline fusion, it would not be weaker than a divine level ninth bloodline. It might even be stronger.</p><p>my cultivation is still too weak, so I can’t fully exert the power of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. As my cultivation improves, I’ll be able to exert more power!</p><p>Thoughts flashed through Lu Ming’s mind and he smiled.</p><p>This way, the fusion of the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline would become his most powerful trump card.</p><p>“I wonder if I’ll be stronger if I use the prison suppressing heavenly art?”</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it.</p><p>One could still see Xie Lun’s figure at the bottom of the prison-suppressing stele, faintly discernible.</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind sank into the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. He adjusted the suppression power of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline on purpose, adjusting the suppression on Xie Lun.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook, and Xie Lun stepped out of it and appeared in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A vast demonic might burst out and broke through the clouds.</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m finally out!”</p><p>Xie Luan laughed heartily. His long hair was loose, and his brows were sharp and his eyes handsome. One could tell that he had been a peerless beauty in his youth, but now, he seemed to have gone mad.</p><p>Lu Ming could understand. A person who had been suppressed for thirty thousand years would be considered lucky if he did not go crazy.</p><p>After a long while, Xie Luan finally calmed down. He looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and said, ” “Let’s go, I’ll bring you guys out of here!”</p><p>A wave of demonic energy swept up Lu Ming and Xie nianqing. Xie Luan took a step forward and appeared at the periphery of the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>Many of the mo Sha clansmen looked at them in shock.</p><p>“It just so happens that I have some ‘tonics’ that can help me recover some of my strength!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s cold voice came out of his mouth. The next moment, a terrifying demonic Qi exploded from his body, enveloping all The Fiend clan members below.</p><p>“Not good, let’s go!”</p><p>“Ah, save me!”</p><p>Within the demonic Qi, shrill screams were heard. Lu Ming saw many fifth and sixth level spiritual God Realm demons turn into ashes without any resistance, turning into pure energy that was absorbed by Xie Lun.</p><p>Xie Lun’s body was like a bottomless abyss, constantly absorbing the energy. The few seventh level spiritual God Realm demons were able to resist for a while, but as Xie Lun took a step forward, they exploded in the air one by one, turning into energy and being absorbed by Xie Lun.</p><p>Xie Luan’s skin was wriggling, and his aura was getting stronger.</p><p>it’s a pity that these Mo Sha are too weak. My Immortal demon body can only recover a little. I’m still thousands of miles away from my peak!</p><p>Xie Luan sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were secretly shocked. The other party was indeed the demon Emperor who had caused chaos in the world. He was truly terrifying. He had been suppressed for 30000 years and had just come out, but his strength was still shocking.</p><p>we can’t stay here for long. I’m afraid the royal family and the Xie family will find out soon. Now, kill our way out!</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. He wrapped Lu Ming and Xie nianqing in his demonic power and stepped forward at a terrifying speed, heading for the exit of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>In just a few moments, they had covered an unknown distance. The city at the exit of the abyss Demon Realm was already in sight.</p><p>Above the city, there was a light barrier that enveloped the entire city.</p><p>Looking down from the sky, there were powerhouses guarding the city.</p><p>In a flash, Xie Luan, Lu Ming, and Xie nianqing appeared in the sky above the city and struck down with a palm.</p><p>A terrifying palm print hit the light shield. The light shield trembled violently, and a hole was created. Xie Luan rushed in.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“Not good, a demonic creature has broken in!”</p><p>Roars rang out from the city, and powerful Qis rose up and charged at Xie Luan.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Those auras were all powerful, overbearing, and extremely terrifying. Many of them were at the fifth or sixth level of the spiritual God Realm, and he could even sense many of them above the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“All of you shall become my nourishment!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes were cold, and his demonic Qi was monstrous. He struck out with his palm, and a group of spiritual God Realm experts exploded. They turned into rolling energy and poured into Xie Luan’s body. His aura grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>Miserable shrieks continued to ring out as experts were killed one after another.</p><p>“Not good, this person is too strong!”</p><p>The experts were shocked and retreated frantically.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, a few terrifying auras rose from the depths of the city. A few figures appeared in front of them in an instant.</p><p>so strong! He has surpassed the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The people who appeared later were absolutely terrifying. Their auras were strong and above the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm. There were two whose auras were vast and unfathomable.</p><p>two ninth level spiritual God Realm and two great circle spiritual God Realm. Hehe!</p><p>Xie Luan sneered and charged forward. Endless demonic Qi condensed into a saber and slashed at his opponent.</p><p>His opponent also exploded with powerful strength, and a terrifying attack poured toward Xie Luan.</p><p>The entire city was shaking and emitting a resplendent light. One after another, large formations were activated. If it weren’t for these large formations, it would have already been destroyed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>ah! a scream was heard. A ninth level spiritual God Realm expert’s head was cut off by Xie Luan. His spiritual God flew out and was swept up by demonic Qi. Xie Luan absorbed it, and his aura grew stronger.</p><p>The remaining three people’s expressions changed drastically. They didn’t dare to block it, and instead retreated rapidly.</p><p>Xie Luan didn’t give chase. He led Lu Ming and the other man toward the exit.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>A majestic voice resounded. In the sky, a huge palm print was formed. It was as big as a mountain, and it was filled with a mysterious aura. That aura was much stronger than the intent realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>This was the attack of a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>A Supreme-being was also considered to be in the great circle of the spiritual God stage. However, a Supreme-being was already half a step into the Martial Emperor stage and possessed some of the Martial Emperor’s might. Their combat strength was much stronger than other great circle spiritual gods.</p><p>Xie Luan’s expression turned grave as the Supreme martial artist made his move.</p><p>The demonic blade in his hand exuded a terrifying demonic might.</p><p>“Chaotic heavens, demonic blade!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s saber slashed out, splitting the sky in half. The terrifying, pitch-black saber projection crashed into the giant palm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a deafening boom, the giant palm was split open by the demonic blade, but Xie Luan was also forced to retreat.</p><p>In front of him, a white-haired old man stepped out. The aura of a Supreme martial artist was revealed on his body.</p><p>“What kind of demonic being dares to barge into this place …”</p><p>The white-haired old man opened his mouth to speak, but before he could finish his words, he was stunned. His eyes were wide open as he stared at Xie Luan, his eyes filled with fear, shock, and disbelief.</p><p>“What … How is that possible?”</p><p>The white-haired old man let out a roar of disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
