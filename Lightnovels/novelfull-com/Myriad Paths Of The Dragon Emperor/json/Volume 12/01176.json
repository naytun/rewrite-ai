It would be best if he could use Xie Luan to get rid of Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>...</p><p>Xie Luan did not say anything. He stood in the air, his eyes looking to the east as if he was sensing something.</p><p>In the eastern part of the talisman Amulet sect, Martial Emperor Di Yi was cultivating in seclusion. At this time, he seemed to sense something. His eyes suddenly opened and shot out two extremely bright lights. A shocking aura rose from his body.</p><p>“Who is spying on me?”</p><p>Martial Emperor Di Yi said slowly.</p><p>Within the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie Luan’s expression suddenly changed. A powerful aura rose from his body involuntarily, but then he quickly restrained it.</p><p>what a powerful cultivation. I didn’t expect such a person to be born in the East barren territory.</p><p>Xie Luan’s brows furrowed slightly as he spoke in a grave tone.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. Could it be that Martial Emperor Di Yi was so powerful? Even Xie Luan was serious?</p><p>Lu Ming, the Martial Emperor Di Yi you mentioned is very powerful. If I was at my peak, I could defeat him. But now, I am not his match. Let’s not mess with him for the time being. Give me some time and I will not be afraid of him!</p><p>Xie Luan spoke slowly, causing the expressions of Lu Ming, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others to change.</p><p>Was Martial Emperor Di Yi really so powerful? Even Xie Luan had taken this matter so seriously, bluntly saying that he wasn’t a match for them.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He knew very well that Xie Lun had been suppressed for thirty thousand years. Although he had recovered a little, he was far from his peak condition. It was too difficult to recover to his peak condition.</p><p>Lu Ming, let’s go back to cold-blood Hall and rest for a few days before heading to Northern Plains. If you want to fight in Northern Plains, you can come here in three days!</p><p>let’s go, ” Xie Luan said to Lu Ming. Then, he and Mo Ye stepped on the air and returned to cold-blood Hall through the inter-territory teleportation formation.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming bade farewell to Bai Shijin and the rest. He held Xie nianqing’s hand and headed to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping’s residence.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Ming stayed at the Lu family’s residence. When he had the time, he would visit Hua Chi and the mystical sword sect.</p><p>Two years ago, Lu Ming had left behind a large number of resources. After two years, everyone had made great progress.</p><p>For example, Hua Chi and pang Shi had both reached the martial King realm.</p><p>His father, Lu Yuntian, had also become a martial King.</p><p>Among them, his two disciples, Zhuang Xiaoshan and Zhuang xiaorou, had made the fastest progress. They had already reached the advanced level of the martial King realm.</p><p>However, this progress was still far from Lu Ming’s expectations.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming left more resources for the Lu family, Hua Chi, and the others.</p><p>There were all sorts of intent crystals, spirit pills, spirit herbs, spirit weapons, and more.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ming, Yan kuangtu, and the talisman Amulet sect’s elders and founding members were gathered in the talisman Amulet sect’s conference hall.</p><p>Lu Ming was sitting on the main seat at the top of the hall.</p><p>This was what Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others had strongly requested.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ming’s cultivation had long entered the spiritual God Realm and had even reached the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. He was already qualified to be in charge of the talisman Amulet sect. Therefore, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest strongly requested for Lu Ming to be the head of the sect. In the future, the talisman Amulet sect would officially be handed over to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming was a zongzi to begin with. Zongzi meant that when his cultivation level increased and he was able to take charge, he would be able to succeed the position of sect leader.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s current cultivation was still lacking, the talisman Amulet sect did not have an Emperor. Therefore, the conditions were not that high. It was about right.</p><p>Lu Ming did not reject too much and accepted it calmly. He really needed his own strength now.</p><p>“Seniors, I have already explained the situation in the central continent, please feel free to speak your mind!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>zongzi, we have sealed off the East continent and been trapped here for years. We know nothing about the situation in the central continent. You know better than us. We will listen to you and do whatever you say!</p><p>Bai Shijin said.</p><p>“This old master also has the same intention!”</p><p>Du songjue said.</p><p>“Haha, Lu Ming, I’ll do whatever you say. I’ll fight with you!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu gulped down a few mouthfuls of wine and laughed.</p><p>en, then I’ll tell you my thoughts. Right now, the central continent is in chaos, all the major forces are fighting and attacking each other. The strong will become stronger while the weak will become weaker. We can’t just sit and wait for death, we have to take the initiative to attack and increase our strength!</p><p>right now, I have formed an alliance with sovereign chaotic heaven, and also with floating mountain. Now that sovereign chaotic heaven wants to invade Northern Plains, we can not miss this opportunity. I plan to gather a group of experts to fight with me. Firstly, we can obtain resources, and secondly, we can temper ourselves. In the future, after we occupy Northern Plains, we can link up with Northern Plains, that way, we can advance and retreat as we wish, what do you think? ”</p><p>Lu Ming shared his thoughts.</p><p>“Then we’ll do as zongzi says!”</p><p>Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll go on an expedition with you. I’ve been in the talisman Amulet sect for a few years and I haven’t fought anyone. It’s really boring!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu said, his eyes filled with a strong desire to fight.</p><p>In the past, Yan kuangtu was a battle general of the Empyrean heaven divine Palace and was a battle fanatic. He had been cooped up in the talisman Amulet sect for the past few years and it was really unbearable. Now that he heard that he could go to war, he naturally wouldn’t miss it. His heart was already itching.</p><p>“I’ll also fight with zongzi!”</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>Two patriarchs from the talisman sect spoke up.</p><p>One of them was an elder of the puppet sect, Meng Chong.</p><p>One of them was jiang ke, an elder of the fu sect.</p><p>The two of them were both Supreme martial artists.</p><p>“Good, with the three of you together, I can rest assured!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>After that, everyone discussed the specific details.</p><p>In addition to Yan kuangtu, Meng Chong, and jiang ke, the three Supreme martial artists, a group of other powerful people had also been transferred to follow Lu Ming on the expedition.</p><p>Some of the younger generation had also chosen to follow Lu Ming as a form of training.</p><p>It was very difficult to improve on the path of cultivation if one only cultivated arduously. One needed to take risks and kill in order to make a breakthrough.</p><p>After the plan was made, the news began to spread. Then, Lu Ming led hundreds of people into the inter-territory teleportation formation and headed for cold-blood Hall.</p><p>The teleportation formation of cold-blood Hall glowed and Lu Ming appeared.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming’s appearance, a voice transmission jade talisman was sent. Xie Luan had invited Lu Ming to the conference hall for a discussion.</p><p>Lu Ming led Yan kuangtu, Meng Chong, and jiang ke to the meeting hall. Xie Luan, Mo Ye, and some Supreme-beings from the myriad demons abyss were all present.</p><p>When some of the Supreme-beings from the myriad demons abyss saw Lu Ming, they scanned Yan kuangtu and the others with their spiritual senses. Their eyes flickered slightly. They did not expect that Lu Ming would have a Supreme-being powerhouse by his side.</p><p>They knew that they had underestimated Lu Ming. In the past, they had thought that Lu Ming was alone. Now, they realized that they were wrong. Lu Ming had his own forces.</p><p>“Lu Ming, sit!”</p><p>Xie Luan pointed at the seat beside him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stand on ceremony and sat down beside Xie Luan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
