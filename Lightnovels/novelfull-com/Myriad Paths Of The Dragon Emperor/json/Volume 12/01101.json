Beside him was another elder from the Huang family, whose cultivation was even worse, only at the perfected spirit embryo realm.</p><p>However, this person’s aura was powerful and far beyond that of an ordinary great circle spirit embryo. Lu Ming speculated that this person must have awakened a divine level bloodline but had not broken through to the spiritual God Realm. He was at the level of an old monster and his combat strength was much stronger than an ordinary great circle spirit embryo.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on Huang Ke’s face directly, making Huang Ke scream like a pig being slaughtered.</p><p>How dare you! You even threatened to cripple me, the commander of the law enforcement Army, in the law enforcement Hall. You’re simply disgraceful and should be killed!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and glared at him. With his full beard, he looked very righteous.</p><p>He exerted force on his feet, causing Huang Ke’s face to rub against the ground.</p><p>“Ah, forefather, save me!”</p><p>Huang Ke screamed in pain.</p><p>“Audacious evil beast, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The perfected spirit embryo elder from the Huang family shouted and took a step forward. His aura was violent and formed a huge palm that pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not good, it’s an old monster with a perfect spirit embryo!”</p><p>The expressions of tie Xing and the others changed drastically.</p><p>Tie Xing was also at the great circle of the spirit embryo realm, but compared to this great circle of the spirit embryo realm who had awakened a divine level bloodline, there was a huge difference in battle prowess.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm. He clenched his palm into a claw and clawed upward.</p><p>With a poof, the elder’s condensed palm instantly crumbled. Lu Ming’s claw formed from essential core did not stop and clawed at the elder at an unbelievable speed. He caught the elder in his hand in an instant.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The elder’s expression changed drastically. His divine level bloodline appeared and he used the fusion of his bloodlines to release a violent attack. He wanted to break through Lu Ming’s true essence claw. Unfortunately, it did not move at all.</p><p>“Get down here!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted. He pulled the elder down from the air and smashed him on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The ground shook and the elder screamed in pain. His protective true vitality was shattered by Lu Ming’s attack. His bones were cracking and many of them were broken. He lay there screaming like a dead dog.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers, including the other people of the law enforcement Hall, were all dumbfounded and looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>Especially those onlookers, they were swallowing their saliva like crazy.</p><p>This law enforcement Hall’s commander was too awesome. First of all, his battle prowess had exceeded everyone’s expectations. An old monster with a perfect spirit embryo realm was dragged down from the air with a single move and smashed into the ground, half dead. This kind of battle prowess could be said to be astonishing.</p><p>Secondly, this commander was too bold. Not only did he cripple Huang Ke, but he also beat up an elder of the Huang family. He would definitely face the anger of a spirit God expert next.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Sure enough, the spirit God expert from the Huang family was furious. He roared and a terrifying aura burst out. A pressure as deep as the ocean filled the entire area. Many people’s expressions changed drastically and they retreated. The pressure formed by a spirit God expert was too strong and absolutely terrifying.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The spiritual God of the Huang family shouted and pointed out a finger. Wherever the finger passed, a yellow light burst out, twisting the space like a wave and finally tearing it apart.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying finger force was pointed at Lu Ming’s glabella.</p><p>“This overpowered commander is finished!”</p><p>Such a thought flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Just as this sentence flashed across everyone’s minds, Lu Ming threw a punch at the sky. A fist ray soared into the sky and collided with the finger force. With a huge boom, the finger force and the fist ray disappeared at the same time.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“He blocked the spiritual God’s attack?”</p><p>Cries of disbelief came from all around.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength had once again exceeded everyone’s expectations. He had actually blocked the spiritual God’s attack.</p><p>The eyes of the law enforcement Hall’s commander flickered. He was extremely surprised.</p><p>As far as he knew, Ming Lu was sent to the law enforcement Army by the eighth prince because he had offended the eighth prince. He had received news that this man’s combat strength was only slightly stronger than the eighth Prince’s. He had recklessly injured the eighth prince when they were sparring, so no matter how strong he was, there was a limit to his combat strength. He did not expect that he could actually block the attack of the spirit God.</p><p>“It seems like this person has been hiding his strength!” The commander in chief of the law enforcement Army thought to himself.</p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. His gaze was like two dazzling Spears of light that pierced towards the Huang family elder. He said coldly,”It seems like you want to be like him!”</p><p>The ‘him’ that Lu Ming was referring to was the old man with a perfected spirit embryo.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual God of the Huang family could not help but feel nervous. At this moment, he could actually feel a terrifying pressure from Lu Ming. It was as if he was facing a terrifying beast that could tear him into pieces if it went crazy.</p><p>This feeling made him panic.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>The spiritual God of the Huang family said with an ugly expression.</p><p>“Apologize in public and admit your mistakes!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>don’t even think about it. Don’t go too far. If you let him go now, I won’t pursue the matter!</p><p>The spiritual God of the Huang family’s face turned ugly, but he had already given in by saying so.</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. this man killed the shopkeeper for no reason. I’m the commander of the law enforcement Army and I enforce the law on behalf of the sacred Emperor. How dare you come to the law enforcement Hall? do you have no respect for the ancient Saint dynasty, the royal family, and the Xie family? ” Do you want to overturn the heavens?”</p><p>and you, as the commander of the law enforcement Hall, not only did you not enforce the law impartially, but you also helped the other party to bully the law enforcement Hall. It seems that you don’t put the imperial family in your eyes at all!</p><p>Lu Ming’s every word struck the heart. The Huang family’s spirit God and the commander of the law enforcement Hall had a drastic change in their expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming was pulling the wool over their eyes and giving them a big hat.</p><p>However, this was too heavy a burden for them to bear.</p><p>There were so many people here today. If Lu Ming’s words were to reach the ears of the imperial family or even the sage Emperor, they would definitely not be able to bear the consequences.</p><p>Although the law enforcement Hall existed in name only and no one really took it to heart, in essence, the law enforcement Hall was still the law enforcement Hall. Before the law enforcement Army was disbanded, its significance was the same as it was 30000 years ago, and it had the power to enforce the law in the world.</p><p>In fact, the other people of the law enforcement Hall could also put such a label on others, because once this matter was blown up, the imperial family would definitely intervene.</p><p>However, the prerequisite was that one had to be strong.</p><p>Take Lu Ming for example. If he was not powerful enough, he would be killed by the Huang family’s expert with one slap. He would not even have the chance to pin the blame on him.</p><p>However, it was different now. Since Lu Ming had already spoken and pinned the blame on them, if they continued to attack, they would have proven Lu Ming’s words of not taking the royal family and the Xie family seriously. In the future, the royal family and the Xie family would definitely take action.</p><p>Otherwise, where would he put his face?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>The spirit God of the Huang family and the Commander-in-Chief of the law enforcement Army gritted their teeth, but they were helpless.</p><p>alright, this matter is my Huang family’s fault. I apologize. In the future, I will definitely warn the disciples of the Huang family to follow the rules of the law enforcement Army!</p><p>The Huang family’s spiritual God had no choice but to apologize. Then, he looked at Huang Ke and asked him to apologize.</p><p>Huang Ke was extremely unwilling, but in the end, she could only apologize.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
