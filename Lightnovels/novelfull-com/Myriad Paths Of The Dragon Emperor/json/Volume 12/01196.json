Bang! Bang!</p><p>...</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s four limbs stepped in the air, making a loud noise as it crawled towards Ming Zi. Its scales glowed as it opened its mouth, looking very ferocious.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A huge claw came down on Dark Child.</p><p>Dark Qi grew thicker around Dark child’s body. The bloodline of the death god appeared above his head.</p><p>Facing such a powerful enemy, Dark Child performed bloodline fusion and transformed into the god of death without any concealment.</p><p>The death flame jumped and the Reaper’s Scythe slashed at the crocodile King.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Grim Reaper’s scythe struck the crocodile Emperor’s claw, producing a clanging sound. Sparks flew in all directions. The Grim Reaper that Ming Zi had transformed into stepped in the void and retreated continuously.</p><p>However, the crocodile Emperor’s body trembled, and it did not pursue him immediately.</p><p>“So it can directly attack the soul. Unfortunately, it’s not powerful enough. What can it do to me? kill!”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor was a little surprised. Its body glowed immediately, and with an angry roar, it continued to attack Ming Zi.</p><p>Ming Zi’s face changed. The death God’s body began to separate and finally turned into 12 death gods, surrounding the crocodile Emperor.</p><p>Dark child’s Twelve Capital Heaven battle formation!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Twelve death god doppelgangers and twelve death god scythes slashed at the crocodile King.</p><p>“Small tricks!”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s voice came out. Its tail swept across thousands of soldiers and shattered the space.</p><p>With a series of rumbles, seven or eight Grim Reapers were sent flying. The remaining Grim Reapers were also sent flying by the crocodile Emperor’s giant claw. The crocodile Emperor only shook a few times. Light began to spread as if it was resisting the soul attack of the Grim Reapers.</p><p>Then, as if nothing had happened, he continued to attack Dark Child.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a swing of its tail, one of the death gods exploded.</p><p>Then, the crocodile King spat out a beam of light, which killed one of the death gods.</p><p>Dark Child was no match for his opponent. After more than ten moves, he was completely suppressed. His 12 clones were defeated continuously.</p><p>Soon, only one of the 12 death gods was left. It was torn apart by the crocodile Emperor’s claws. Ming Zi’s real body appeared and he retreated rapidly, spitting out blood.</p><p>Dark Child was defeated. He was also no match.</p><p>can’t even withstand a single blow. It seems like the strongest in the divine wilderness continent is only at this level!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor looked arrogantly at Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s expressions did not change. However, the rest of the people did not look too good.</p><p>Even dark Child had been defeated. The remaining people like the unscrupulous monk and yang potian were not confident at all. Their combat strength might not be able to defeat Dark Child.</p><p>it seems like the divine wilderness continent is bound to lose. They don’t have any exceptional paragons!</p><p>that’s right. I just don’t know the ranking of the person who attacked you on the Shen ‘e continent.</p><p>the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. I’m sure that the Shen ‘e continent’s ranking is not low. The Shen’ e continent is not stupid. They will naturally send out experts!</p><p>The surrounding people were discussing.</p><p>“Next, which one of you will make a move?”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor continued to speak. It seemed that it was really going to fight them one by one.</p><p>The expressions of the unscrupulous monk, yang potian, and the others changed, but they didn’t say anything.</p><p>Hmph, truly trash. How about this, all of you come at me together, and I’ll take care of both of you. I’ll let all of you be sincerely convinced and roll down general peak!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor spoke arrogantly. He wanted everyone from the divine wilderness continent to attack him together.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi gritted his teeth with a menacing glint in his eyes. If not for the fact that he knew that he was no match for them, he would have charged forward.</p><p>“What’s with that look? Not convinced? Then let’s start with you!”</p><p>The Emperor alligator glanced at tuo BA Shi with a cold light in its eyes. Its tail, which was covered with scales, whipped at tuo BA Shi.</p><p>Chi Chi …</p><p>The space was torn apart like paper as the tail whipped toward Tuoba Shi with a terrifying spatial storm.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s expression changed drastically. His cultivation was only at the peak third level of the spiritual God Realm, a full level lower than his opponent’S. He was no match for his opponent’s full strength.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and was about to use all his strength to resist this move when a voice rang out.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and appeared in front of Tuoba Shi. The Dragon power in his body roared and his vital essence boiled. Lu Ming reached out his palm and grabbed the giant crocodile Emperor’s tail.</p><p>“I grabbed my tail with my bare hands, so break my arms!”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s eyes were ferocious, but the next moment, it was shocked.</p><p>His tail struck Lu Ming’s palm heavily, but Lu Ming’s palm and body did not move at all. His tail was caught by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Lu Ming exhaled and grabbed the crocodile Emperor’s tail with both hands. He lifted the crocodile Emperor’s huge body like a hammer and smashed it towards the mountain peak.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s huge body smashed onto the general peak, causing the entire mountain to shake. Countless inscriptions appeared on the surface of the general peak to offset the terrifying force.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the protection of the inscription formation, the entire general would have been blown up without a single stone left.</p><p>The rest of the people from the Shen ‘e continent were stunned, and the onlookers in the distance were also stunned.</p><p>They had never expected that there would be someone so powerful in the divine wilderness continent who could swing the crocodile Emperor’s huge body like a hammer.</p><p>“It’s not over yet, it’s coming again!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming was not done after smashing it. He picked up the crocodile Emperor’s body and smashed it again.</p><p>“Brat, let me go!”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor roared and struggled madly.</p><p>However, it was useless. At this moment, Lu Ming had burst out eight streams of dragon power. His divine power was invincible and the crocodile Emperor could not struggle at all.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s huge body smashed down again, shaking the ground above.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, there were loud rumbles on the mountain peak. The crocodile Emperor was smashed on the mountain peak and screamed.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent’s paragons, such as Ming Zi, yang potian, and the others sucked in a breath of cold air. Shi du, in particular, was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Lu Ming was getting stronger. He was really violent. They silently mourned for the crocodile Emperor.</p><p>But in his heart, he felt extremely comfortable.</p><p>Wasn’t the crocodile Emperor very arrogant? Now, he’s going to be a dead dog, right?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After being hit more than ten times, the other party finally could not maintain the state of blood fusion and transformed back into human form. Lu Ming kicked the other party’s face, sending him flying into the distance.</p><p>A young man from the Shen ‘e continent flew out and caught him. Otherwise, no one knew where he would have flown to.</p><p>who would have thought that there would be such an expert in the divine wilderness continent. I really couldn’t tell!</p><p>this is interesting. It is the Shen ‘e continent’s turn to have a headache!</p><p>In the distance, some people were discussing. To them, no matter which side won, it had nothing to do with them. They were just watching the show.</p><p>Hmph, that kid does have some strength, but the real masters of the Shen ‘e continent have not appeared yet.</p><p>Mu Feng snorted.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was within his expectations. Since Lu Ming could easily defeat him in the past, it was normal for him to defeat an expert at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm from the Shen ‘e continent.</p><p>However, there were even more powerful cultivators on the Shen ‘e continent. How could he have made such an arrangement so simply?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
