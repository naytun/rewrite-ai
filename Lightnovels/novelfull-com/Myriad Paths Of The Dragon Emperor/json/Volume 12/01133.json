Anyone who enters the abyss demon territory and kills the Mosha clan will be rewarded with points. As long as you can get ten thousand points, I promise to let you two leave together and never interfere with nianqing’s Affairs again!</p><p>Xie Qitian said.</p><p>“Alright, I agree!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Lu Ming believed that Xie Qitian would not go back on his word in front of so many emperors and people.</p><p>Lu Ming was clear that it would not be easy to go to the abyss demon territory to hunt down the Mosha clan. However, there was still hope.</p><p>Moreover, his identity had been exposed. Di Yi would probably find out soon. Entering the abyss demon territory, not only could he find Xie nianqing, but he could also avoid Di Yi for the time being. For Lu Ming, it was killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of Xie Zhen, Xie qiyu, and the others flickered. They did not say anything, and it was unknown what they were thinking.</p><p>alright, it’s settled then. After the banquet is over, I’ll ask someone to take you to the demon Realm of Tartarus!</p><p>Xie Qitian said.</p><p>Immediately after, Xie Qitian asked the unscrupulous monk about his conditions. The unscrupulous monk was very smart. He said that he would not mention it for the time being and would mention it in the future.</p><p>“Good. Three days from now, the top ten will be able to enter the ancient Hall of the Saint Emperor to comprehend the Dao!”</p><p>Xie Qitian announced, and the banquet continued.</p><p>The banquet lasted for half a day before it ended.</p><p>The Overlord forces began to leave one by one.</p><p>The Masters of the Wang family, the Jiang family, and the divine Emperor also left in a hurry.</p><p>They had to rush back to the East barren to report to Di Yi about Lu Ming.</p><p>It was too strange. Lu Ming was still in the talisman Amulet sect. How did he suddenly appear in the central continent and now he was going to enter the abyss Demon Realm? Di Yi had to know about this as soon as possible.</p><p>Soon, everyone dispersed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with us!”</p><p>The two guards in metal armor came to Lu Ming and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the two of them and realized that he could not see through their cultivation at all. Their cultivation was unfathomable.</p><p>“To the abyss demon territory?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>that’s right. The sage Emperor ordered us to take you to the abyss demonic realm. The entrance to the abyss demonic realm is to the North of the holy city!</p><p>One of the armored guards said.</p><p>“Please!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two armored guards took the lead and Lu Ming followed behind. They headed north of the holy city.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the northern side of the holy city. After passing through layers and layers of barriers, they came to a huge door of light.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Ming did a quick calculation. They had passed a total of eighteen checkpoints. Each checkpoint had an extremely powerful array and was guarded by powerful experts.</p><p>It could be seen that the imperial family placed great importance on this place.</p><p>this is the entrance to the abyss Demon Realm. Take this Jade token. As long as you kill a fiend clan member in the abyss Demon Realm, the Jade token will sense it and you will get the corresponding points!</p><p>One of the armored guards introduced. However, there was a hint of a cold smile in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>“Many thanks!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the Jade card and kept it.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go in!”</p><p>One of the guards said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and turned around. He stepped into the door of light and disappeared.</p><p>hehe, you want to get 10000 points in the abyss Demon Realm? dream on! Stay there for the rest of your life!</p><p>“The sage Emperor’s move is truly brilliant!”</p><p>The two guards sneered, then turned around and strode away.</p><p>At this moment, in the palace, Xie Zhen and Xie Qi Yu were sitting opposite each other in a Hall.</p><p>Imperial brother’s move is indeed brilliant. Not only did you shut Lu Ming’s mouth, but you also fulfilled your promise. I’m really impressed!</p><p>Xie qiyu took a sip of the spirit tea and smiled.</p><p>it’s almost impossible to kill the mo Sha in the abyss demon territory and get ten thousand points. But I still feel uneasy!</p><p>Xie Zhen frowned. that b * tch, Xie nianqing, is too talented. He’s no weaker than the top figures. Moreover, he has awakened a dark-type bloodline. He’s like a fish in water in the abyss demon territory. He can still cultivate and improve his cultivation.</p><p>as for that Lu Ming, he’s even more shocking. Three years ago, he was only at the Sea of Souls realm, and his cultivation was lower than mine. However, in just a short three years, his cultivation has soared to the third level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength is even more shocking, and he has defeated many big shots and geniuses in a row. In my opinion, no one can suppress him except Long Chen. I can’t rest easy as long as such a person is alive!</p><p>“You want to kill him in the abyss Demon Realm?”</p><p>Xie Tianyu said.</p><p>that’s right. However, although this Lu Ming’s cultivation is only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm, his combat strength is too terrifying. I’m afraid that even an ordinary sixth level spiritual God is not his match. To kill him, we’ll have to mobilize a seventh level spiritual God or even stronger existence. However, with my authority, I can’t mobilize such a strong existence. Therefore, I’ll need Imperial uncle’s help!</p><p>Xie Zhen said.</p><p>hmm, you’re right. We can’t let Lu Ming live. We should take this opportunity to kill Xie nianqing and the other mutant!</p><p>Xie qiyu’s face revealed a cold smile.</p><p>“Many thanks, Imperial uncle!” Xie Zhen was overjoyed as he thanked him.</p><p>……</p><p>After Lu Ming stepped into the door of light, he stepped out from another door of light.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze and realized that he had already arrived at another place.</p><p>This place seemed to be a city. Above the city, there was a huge light shield that covered the entire city, making it impossible to see the scene outside the light shield.</p><p>“Is this the abyss demon territory?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>“Another person has come!”</p><p>A voice was heard from the side. Lu Ming saw a few burly men in armor.</p><p>“Big Brothers, is this the abyss demon territory?”</p><p>Lu Ming went forward and asked.</p><p>that’s right. This is the abyss demon territory. We’re from the royal family, and we’re responsible for guarding this city and preventing The Fiend clan from attacking the exit here. Why have you come here? ”</p><p>One of the burly men explained and asked.</p><p>I’m here to hunt down the mo Sha clan and obtain points!</p><p>Lu Ming said, but he did not tell the truth.</p><p>“Another exiles!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lu Ming’s words, the few burly men’s faces turned cold and they sneered.</p><p>“Exiles?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>alright, you can stay in this city for the night. The moon is high in the sky now, and the demonic Qi is at its strongest. In order to prevent the demonic Qi from seeping in, the city is now tightly closed and will not open. You can leave the city tomorrow!</p><p>A man in armor waved his hand and said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He did not ask further and left the place in big strides.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming came to a Street and realized that there were quite a lot of people here. However, every one of them had an extremely strong aura and were all experts.</p><p>With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he found that there were many spiritual God Realm existences.</p><p>These people were all sent by the imperial family to guard this place.</p><p>Lu Ming walked around and asked around. Indeed, he could not leave the city now. He had to wait until tomorrow.</p><p>Lu Ming casually found a quiet place and sat cross-legged, waiting quietly.</p><p>More than an hour after Lu Ming had entered the place, the door of light in the abyss demon territory flashed and four elders appeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
