Only those with ninth-ranked divine level bloodlines are qualified to participate in the heavenly God sect’s selection. Follow me!</p><p>“What? Not even an eighth level divine level bloodline was qualified? Only those at the ninth level of the divine level are qualified?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked by his words.</p><p>These conditions were too high.</p><p>How many ninth grade divine level geniuses were there in the entire divine wilderness?</p><p>“A bunch of frogs in a well. Do you all think that a ninth level divine level expert is very impressive? A ninth level deity might be the top in the small divine wilderness continent. But what was the yuan continent? The core of the primordial realm, the tianshen sect, is a large sect in the yuan continent. The minimum standard for them to recruit disciples is that their bloodline must be of the ninth grade of the God tier!”</p><p>“You can’t even meet the basic requirements and you still want to join the heaven God sect?”</p><p>The cold and arrogant youth sneered and revealed a mocking expression.

He did not hide the fiery light in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and his eyes turned cold.</p><p>“You’re a ninth level divine level expert. Why did you leave? You don’t want your fortune anymore?”</p><p>The arrogant youth said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“If he can’t meet the requirements, I’ll go with him. If he can’t go, I naturally won’t go either!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming and said.</p><p>“Him?”</p><p>The arrogant youth looked at Lu Ming with a hint of disdain in his eyes.’He’s just a piece of trash at the eighth level of the divine level. He can’t meet the requirements at all. What qualifications does he have to participate? You, on the other hand, are quite talented. Why waste your bright future for a piece of trash? come with us!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned cold and he said coldly, ” “Watch your words. I’m telling you, if he’s not going, I’m not going either. Also, he’s not a good-for-nothing. Lu Ming, let’s go!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pulled Lu Ming and was about to fly back.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>With a cold snort, the arrogant youth moved and appeared in front of Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, blocking their way. you’ve met the requirements and must go. This is not only related to your future, but also to the gate of God!</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming and said, ” kid, if you’re smart, get lost. You’re a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. Do you think you’re worthy of this lady? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned cold.</p><p>From the very beginning, this person had been looking at Xie nianqing with ill intentions. Now, he was calling him trash again and again. Did he really think he was noble?</p><p>“Where did this wild dog come from? If you bark here, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold and disdainful voice was heard.</p><p>The commotion here naturally attracted everyone’s attention. Everyone at the scene looked over.</p><p>At this moment, many people were shocked when they heard Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>this Lu Ming is really gutsy. He actually dares to berate the divine Ruins continent’s Paragon like this? ”</p><p>“It’s over. Lu Ming is in trouble!”</p><p>“Simply courting death!”</p><p>he doesn’t know what’s good for him. I think he’s just used to being arrogant in the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Some people sighed, while others sneered and gloated.</p><p>“Kid, what did you say?”</p><p>As expected, the arrogant youth’s eyes turned completely cold, and his killing intent exploded.</p><p>He was a famous existence even in the divine Ruins continent, where geniuses were as common as clouds. There were not many people who dared to talk to him like that.</p><p>Now, in the divine wilderness continent, there was actually someone who dared to speak to him like that, berate him like that, and call him a wild dog. He was simply courting death!</p><p>“It seems like your hearing isn’t good either. Wild dog, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated again.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death! I’ll cripple you!”</p><p>you! the arrogant youth was furious as a terrifying aura exploded from his body.</p><p>His aura continued to rise. Second level spiritual God Realm, third level spiritual God Realm, fourth level spiritual God Realm …</p><p>In the end, it rose to the peak of the fourth level spiritual God Realm before stopping.</p><p>Peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Many people were shocked as they looked at the arrogant youth in shock.</p><p>The icily arrogant youth was clearly young and belonged to the younger generation. His cultivation had actually reached the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. It was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Currently, the divine wilderness continent’s top paragons, such as Ming Zi and yang potian, were only at the peak of the third level of the spiritual God Realm. The only one who was certain to be at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm and above was long Chen.</p><p>However, this young man had a cultivation base at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The cold and arrogant young man sent a palm strike toward Lu Ming.</p><p>His palm was covered with a layer of green light, and the space was smashed into pieces.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and struck out with his palm as well.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two palms collided, and the force of the palm swept out like an avalanche. Then, a figure staggered back a hundred meters in the air, his face pale.</p><p>It was the cold and arrogant young man. He had been pushed back by Lu Ming with one palm.</p><p>At the scene, the rest of the people were at a loss for words. They looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>After not seeing him for some time, Lu Ming had obviously become more powerful. He could actually defeat the cold and arrogant youth with one palm.</p><p>Only Tuoba Shi sneered. He knew how terrifying Lu Ming’s combat strength was.</p><p>“Ah, you’re looking for death, I want you to die!”</p><p>The arrogant youth roared in anger.</p><p>He had actually been forced back by a single palm strike, and the one who had done so was someone from the divine wilderness continent, someone he had seen as trash. He could not stand it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A green tree appeared above his head, and on it were nine golden chakra, shining brightly.</p><p>This person had also awakened a ninth-rank divine bloodline and was a genius at the giant level.</p><p>This made yang potian, Dark Child, and the others ‘expressions turn extremely grave. This person’s cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth level spiritual God Realm, and his bloodline was also at the ninth level of the divine level. His combat strength had already surpassed theirs.</p><p>Was there really such a genius in the divine Ruins continent? Or was this person already one of the top few in the divine Ruins continent?</p><p>Just as all sorts of thoughts flashed through everyone’s mind, the arrogant youth had already used his bloodline fusion and turned into a green tree.</p><p>The green tree was as tall as the sky and as large as a mountain. A terrifying aura was released, and the green light was boundless as it pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>so strong! He’s really strong!</p><p>an ordinary sixth level spiritual God will definitely die, and even a seventh level spiritual God will be severely injured!</p><p>“Let’s see how Lu Ming can block it!”</p><p>The cold and arrogant youth’s strength shocked many people, and even the emperors were moved.</p><p>This was a true-blue heaven’s favorite. In a battle of the same level, he would not be any weaker than the other heaven’s favorites in the divine wilderness continent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
