What is a heaven’s secrets instrument?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the ball of light above his head and frowned.</p><p>With such a huge ball of light on his head, how could he travel?</p><p>At this moment, Xie Qitian’s figure reappeared. He looked at the sky and sighed. “As expected, the imperial family still used the heaven’s secrets instrument!”</p><p>“Senior, what is a heaven’s secrets instrument?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>You should know about the secret Chamber of Commerce, right? ”</p><p>Xie Qitian said.</p><p>yes! Lu Ming nodded and said, ” I heard that the horizon Chamber of Commerce is controlled by the royal family, the Xie family!</p><p>“That’s right. The heaven secret Chamber of Commerce was founded by the Royal Xie family. Their goal is to grasp the news from all over the world. They use the heaven secret instrument to see through many things that others don’t know. At the same time, the heaven secret instrument has another function, which is to pursue and pursue. As long as you can grasp a person’s aura and activate the heaven secret instrument, you can condense a projection of the heaven secret instrument above that person’s head and find that person’s location.”</p><p>now, the imperial family has obviously activated the heaven’s secrets instrument. The projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument will emit a kind of heaven’s secrets force field. As long as an inscriber makes a disk array that can sense the heaven’s secrets force field, they will be able to sense the approximate location of the heaven’s secrets instrument projection and lock onto your position from there. I’m afraid that it won’t be long before you are found!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“It’s actually so magical?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He circulated the essential core in his body and threw a few punches in succession.</p><p>A few rays of fist radiance shot up into the sky and pierced through the space. However, they were of no use to the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection and directly passed through it.</p><p>it’s useless. The heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection can’t be destroyed. Unless the other party stops operating the heaven’s secrets instrument, the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection will always be there!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“I don’t believe it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he formed a seal with his hands. Two light doors appeared in the sky.</p><p>It was the sealing gate of the nine seals of the gate of God.</p><p>The two doors of light landed on the two sides of the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection, emitting a resplendent light. Under the light of the sealing door, the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection actually dimmed and slowly shrank.</p><p>“This is … The nine seals of the gate of God?”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>In the sky, the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection, which was about to dim, suddenly shone brightly again. The two gates of sealing exploded.</p><p>“The nine seals of the gate of God are useless!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>I didn’t expect you to have mastered the nine seals of the divine Gate. This is the ultimate technique of the sky-sealing divine warrior. With the nine seals of the divine Gate, you should be able to seal the heaven’s secrets instrument projection for a while. However, your cultivation is too weak, so you can’t seal the heaven’s secrets instrument projection. How about this? you can teach me the nine seals of the divine Gate. When I understand it, I can definitely seal the heaven’s secrets instrument projection for a while and buy us some time!</p><p>Xie Luan suggested.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming agreed without thinking.</p><p>It was just a secret technique, so what if he passed it on to Xie Lun? as long as it could solve their current predicament.</p><p>Lu Ming then handed the Jade talisman that recorded the nine seals of the gate of God to Xie Luan.</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so decisive.</p><p>“This kid will definitely be a number one figure in the future!” Xie Luan thought.</p><p>alright, keep flying east. As long as you keep moving, it will increase the difficulty of the other party finding you!</p><p>Xie Luan said. Then he entered the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“Little Qing, you should enter the mountain and river diagram first!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded. She also understood that it would be more convenient for Lu Ming to act alone.</p><p>After a flash of light, Xie nianqing entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and continued to fly toward the east.</p><p>Using the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps, Lu Ming was as fast as a stream of light. Moreover, he was flying in a remote direction.</p><p>……</p><p>On this day, the entire central continent was in shock.</p><p>The royal family, the Xie family, sent a message to all the major forces in the world. Not only were they the overlords, but they were also the forces that were a level lower than them.</p><p>The royal family activated the heaven’s secrets instrument and condensed a heaven’s secrets projection on Lu Ming. They called on all major forces to kill Lu Ming. Whoever killed Lu Ming would be rewarded with a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure.</p><p>Once the news was out, central continent was in an uproar.</p><p>The royal family had actually activated the heaven’s secrets instrument and its target was Lu Ming!</p><p>If they remembered correctly, didn’t lu Ming enter the abyss Demon Realm after the million-year sacrifice?</p><p>Many people who knew the inside story knew that the score that Xie Qitian had set for Lu Ming was to imprison him for life. It was impossible for him to achieve that score. However, the royal family had activated the heaven’s secrets instrument to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>How did Lu Ming escape?</p><p>Most importantly, the royal family’s reward was a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure. This shocked all the major forces, regardless of whether they were overlords or lower-level forces. Then, they became greedy.</p><p>The royal family and the Xie family were actually willing to take out a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure?</p><p>As its name suggested, it was a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure that could help martial artists transcend their tribulations.</p><p>A martial artist’s journey was filled with many tribulations.</p><p>Not counting the other tribulations, just the heavenly tribulations alone were not few in number.</p><p>There was a Heavenly Tribulation to break through to the martial King realm!</p><p>There was a Heavenly Tribulation for breaking through to the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>When a spiritual God broke through to the Emperor realm, there would also be a Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>There were many tribulations, and each tribulation was more terrifying than the previous one. How many people could survive all of them?</p><p>As for tribulation-transcending heavenly treasures, they could help people transcend their tribulations. They could be used regardless of their cultivation level.</p><p>It could be said that the success rate of using a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure to break through to the martial King realm was 100%.</p><p>The success rate of breaking through to the spiritual God Realm would increase by 50%.</p><p>Breaking through to the Emperor realm would also increase the success rate of transcending the Tribulation by several times. How tempting was this? Which force? Which expert would not be tempted?</p><p>Moreover, tribulation-transcending heavenly treasures could be used repeatedly. If one person used it, another person could also use it. This was too important for a large force. How many experts could it increase?</p><p>The most fatal temptation was to a Supreme martial artist.</p><p>The next step for Supreme-beings was to break through to the Emperor realm. Tribulation-transcending heavenly treasures were fatally tempting to them.</p><p>Immediately, the various Overlord forces and the forces one level lower refined array discs that could sense the heaven’s legacy force field to sense Lu Ming’s location.</p><p>Lu Ming kept flying. In the blink of an eye, a day had passed. He had no idea how far he had flown.</p><p>There was a projection of the heaven’s secrets apparatus above his head, so he naturally couldn’t take the teleportation array. He could only rely on himself to fly.</p><p>not good, Lu Ming. There’s a powerful being approaching from the North. It’s a perfected spiritual God!</p><p>Suddenly, Xie Luan’s voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>“Great circle of the spiritual God stage?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>With his current cultivation, if he were to encounter a great circle spiritual God, death would be the only outcome. There was no possibility of him resisting at all.</p><p>“I’ll take you away!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s figure appeared. He mustered his remaining strength and tore open the space. He brought Lu Ming into the space and disappeared.</p><p>Just as Xie Luan took Lu Ming away, a terrifying sword light flew over from the distance. It was a skinny old man, holding a formation disk in his hand. His face was extremely gloomy. damn it, I clearly sensed that he was here just now. How did he disappear in the blink of an eye? ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
