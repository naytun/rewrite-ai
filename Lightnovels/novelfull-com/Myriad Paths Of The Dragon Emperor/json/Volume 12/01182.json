It stopped when Lu Ming’s aura rose to the third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>He suppressed his cultivation to the third level of the spiritual God Realm, the same realm as Tuoba Shi.</p><p>Groan! “Groan!”</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar rang out from within Lu Ming’s body. Dragon energy burst out one after another. A purple glow spread across Lu Ming’s skin as his muscles bulged, filled with explosive power.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s expression turned serious. Not daring to be negligent, he raised his cultivation to the maximum. At the same time, a bloodline appeared above his head.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s bloodline was a stone. To be precise, it was a stone as large as a mountain. It was crystal clear like a huge diamond.</p><p>Tuoba Shi used his bloodline fusion and turned into a huge stone. His voice came from within, ” “Lu Ming, come on!”</p><p>His voice was filled with confidence.</p><p>At that moment, he had performed the blood Meridian fusion. Putting everything else aside, he was confident that no one in his generation could beat him in terms of defense. He did not believe that Lu Ming could defeat him in one move.</p><p>haha, he’s definitely going to win. Lu Ming can’t possibly break Tuoba Shi’s defense!</p><p>he’s too confident. Overconfidence is arrogance!</p><p>The people of the hundred beasts tribe were all overjoyed.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The third bloodline emerged above Lu Ming’s head. In an instant, Lu Ming’s body was filled with endless killing intent.</p><p>A wisp of energy from the third Blood Meridian gushed into Lu Ming’s body, and he was enveloped in a layer of blood-red light.</p><p>As Lu Ming’s cultivation level increased, the power he borrowed from the third bloodline also increased and became stronger.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and threw a punch at Tuoba Shi.</p><p>One could vaguely see the shadow of the prison-guarding stele on the fist, which gave off a heaven-suppressing aura. At the spine, the fragment of the prison-guarding stele trembled slightly, making the power of the prison-guarding heavenly technique reach its maximum.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch and the expressions of the hundred beasts tribe powerhouses changed drastically. The power of Lu Ming’s punch was too terrifying and shocking.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi could also feel the terrifying power of this punch. Before the punch even arrived, the powerful pressure already made his heart tremble. His bloodline trembled, and a layer of light appeared, increasing his defense.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming’s punch landed on Tuoba Shi’s Blood Meridian.</p><p>The light screen trembled violently and broke as the fist landed on Tuoba Shi’s bloodline.</p><p>A deafening sound rang out, and the space shattered like a spider web.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Compared to Tuoba Shi’s bloodline, Lu Ming’s fist was very small. However, wherever his fist landed, Tuoba Shi’s bloodline emitted a cracking sound. A crack appeared on the huge diamond-like rock. In an instant, the crack expanded rapidly and finally exploded.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s original body was revealed among the rubble. His face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body flew backward like a cannonball and fell to the ground in an arc.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tuoba Shi fell to the ground and only managed to get up after a long while.</p><p>The entire place was silent!</p><p>“You won?”</p><p>Qu Luo, Mo Ye, and the others muttered to themselves, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Mo Ye had been cultivating in the myriad demons abyss for many years and didn’t know much about the geniuses in the outside world. However, when Tuoba Shi unleashed his bloodline, it was a ninth level divine bloodline, which was even higher than his talent when he was young.</p><p>He had such amazing talent but he was defeated by Lu Ming in one move. Moreover, they were of the same level. This caused him to be greatly shocked.</p><p>“He was defeated? How could this be?”</p><p>The people of the hundred beasts tribe also looked at this scene in shock, unable to say a word for a while.</p><p>The peerless heaven’s favorite of the hundred beasts tribe, a heaven’s favorite that only appeared once in 100000 years, someone who was seen as the future heaven’s favorite of the hundred beasts tribe, had actually been defeated by someone of the same level in one move. This was hard to believe, and hard to accept.</p><p>They looked at Lu Ming and then at Tuoba Shi in a daze, as if they were in a dream.</p><p>“I … He’s been defeated!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi stood up and spoke with difficulty.</p><p>There was a dejected look in his eyes.</p><p>He was actually defeated by Lu Ming in one move when they were at the same level. As proud as he was, it was hard for him to accept this.</p><p>At the same time, he was extremely shocked.</p><p>Compared to the battle at the holy city, Lu Ming was much stronger. Was long Chen, who was known as the number one expert in the world, still a match for Lu Ming?</p><p>Not only was Tuoba Shi shocked, but the Barbarian Emperor was also extremely shocked.</p><p>“This kid is unbelievable, unbelievable!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s eyes flickered as he thought of a sentence.</p><p>“Barbarian Emperor, I’ve already won. It’s time for you to fulfill your promise, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to the Barbarian Emperor.</p><p>don’t worry, the people of the hundred beasts tribe always keep our word. Since you’ve won, then the hundred beasts tribe will surrender!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s voice reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>The people of the hundred beasts tribe sighed, but no one spoke.</p><p>Indeed, the people of the hundred beasts tribe were true to their words. Moreover, they also understood that if they were to fight today, the hundred beasts tribe would not be able to escape the fate of destruction, just like the mountain piercing sect.</p><p>“But …”</p><p>At this moment, the Barbarian Emperor’s tone changed. His gaze swept across qu Luo, Mo Ye, and the others before landing on Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, the hundred beasts tribe will only surrender to you and no one else!”</p><p>Qu Luo and Mo Ye’s expressions changed at this.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s meaning was very clear. He only wanted to surrender to Lu Ming and not to anyone else, not to Xie Luan.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be the commander, so you’ll naturally surrender to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned.</p><p>This was the result he wanted. If the hundred beasts tribe surrendered to him, they would be considered his power. In the future, they would definitely stand on his side.</p><p>In this way, his strength would truly surge, and he would be able to stand on equal footing with Xie Lun.</p><p>“Brother Tuoba, I apologize for my offense earlier!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at Tuoba Shi.</p><p>“Brother Lu’s talent is something I’m ashamed of!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi sighed and shook his head, but his eyes were filled with admiration.</p><p>After that, the hundred beasts tribe kept their formation and held a ceremony to surrender Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming received news that Xie Luan had also been successfully taken down.</p><p>On Xie Luan’s side, one was exterminated while the other surrendered. One of the overlords refused to surrender, and its Emperor was personally killed by Xie Luan.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Xie Luan’s combat strength was truly astonishing. He could kill an Emperor on his own, and that was before he had fully recovered. He wondered how powerful he would be if he had recovered to his peak.</p><p>At this point, the strength of the five overlords of Northern Plains had either been destroyed or surrendered, not to mention the other small forces, they all surrendered.</p><p>Northern Plains was basically unified.</p><p>……</p><p>Several days later, the news of Northern Plains being unified spread throughout the divine wilderness continent, shocking the world.</p><p>Although the central continent heroes were shocked, they had no time to care about anything else. The battle in the central continent was even more intense, the major forces were busy with their own affairs.</p><p>The Imperial Xie family and the heaven suppressing divine Legion had been fighting fiercely in the geocentric sea in the central continent.</p><p>Both sides suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>The remaining Overlord forces that did not participate in the Alliance were also in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Only the eastern barren territory, the southern nether, and the Western Desert were peaceful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
