Bang!</p><p>The two figures retreated a hundred meters away from each other and stood opposite each other.</p><p>A draw. This move was a draw.</p><p>This made many people dumbfounded.</p><p>This Minglu could actually block Shi DU’s move. Although he was forced back, he also forced Shi du back. Wasn’t he too strong?</p><p>Could it be that Minglu was also a heaven’s favorite of the big shots?</p><p>Everyone’s heart twitched. Since when were powerful beings so worthless?</p><p>Shi du himself was also very shocked, but this aroused his ferocity even more.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>arghh! Shi du roared as the Golden flames on his body jumped dozens of meters high. The terrifying heat seemed to be able to melt everything. It twisted the space and even burned through it, revealing a dark space.</p><p>His aura also became more violent and shocking.</p><p>In his body, the sun god lion’s bloodline started to boil as if it was about to turn into a golden sun.</p><p>The peak of the second level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Shi DU’s cultivation was at the peak of the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Minglu, we’re both at the second level of the spiritual God Realm. I’ll let you understand the difference between us!</p><p>Shi du said coldly, looking at Lu Ming with an extremely cold gaze.</p><p>The cultivation that Lu Ming had just revealed was at the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>who said that my cultivation is at the second level of the spiritual God Realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A violent aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body and spread in all directions.</p><p>Third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>At this moment, the cultivation that Lu Ming revealed was at the third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“What? This Minglu’s cultivation is at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. How is that possible?”</p><p>WOWO, he’s too strong. This guy has been hiding his strength all this time!</p><p>“This is too abnormal!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation erupted, causing an uproar in the surroundings. Lu Ming’s cultivation had actually reached the terrifying third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>When he tested his bone age earlier, he was clearly not even twenty-five years old. To rush to the third level of the spiritual God Realm before the age of twenty-five was too shocking and terrifying.</p><p>Even the sovereigns and sovereigns in the stands were shocked.</p><p>“Saint-Emperor, I didn’t think that the imperial family would have such a talented genius hidden within. I really admire him!”</p><p>One of the emperors spoke.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>There was actually such a heaven’s favorite in the law enforcement Army, and he had not noticed it before.</p><p>As for the eighth prince, Xie Zhen, his eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He had never dreamed that this Ming Lu, who had been demoted to a lowly ant in the law enforcement Army, was actually so terrifying.</p><p>If this person had wanted to kill him before, he would have been dead long ago.</p><p>In the crowd, Shi Zheng and Shi Fang, whose cultivation had been crippled, were pale.</p><p>Lu Ming’s outburst of cultivation shocked the other talents on the platform.</p><p>Yang potian, Tuoba Shi, Ming Zi, and the other paragons who were in the middle of a battle felt Lu Ming’s powerful aura and their eyes turned grave.</p><p>As for Lion City himself, he was even more shocked.</p><p>third level of the spiritual God Realm? how is that possible? ”</p><p>Even the lion roared.</p><p>Lion Capital, I heard that you’re ranked fifth among the five Giants of the central continent. Although you’re a little lacking, your looks aren’t bad. You’re about the same as my little gold. I’ll force myself to take you as my Mount!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward, his aura was wild.</p><p>The little gold he was talking about was King Kong, the Golden Tiger that Lu Ming had taken down in the battle of Providence.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. This awesome commander actually wanted to take liondu as his Mount? It was simply whimsical, arrogant, and ignorant.</p><p>you’re courting death. Don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because your cultivation has reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>The lion was furious and his lungs were about to explode.</p><p>He, Lion City, was destined to become an Emperor in the future. This big-bearded man actually wanted to take him as a Mount. He deserved to die.</p><p>So what if they were at the third level of the spiritual God Realm? it was common for Lion City to fight those of a higher realm.</p><p>The sun god lion’s blood boiled. It was as if the lion had completely transformed into a golden sun, pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The true essence of the third level of the spiritual God Realm in his body boiled and gushed out like a tsunami. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique, and with the support of his intent and dragon power, he blasted toward the golden sun.</p><p>With an earth-shattering explosion, everyone was shocked to find that the golden sun had been sent flying.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body only swayed a little.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Then, Lu Ming shouted and rushed toward Lion City, launching a storm of attacks.</p><p>The lion roared, shaking the sky and the space around it.</p><p>Blood Rascal also knew the sound wave technique, but compared to Lion City, he was not even worthy to carry his shoes.</p><p>Lu Ming punched out with both fists continuously, breaking Shi DU’s sound wave technique. The force of his punches landed heavily on Shi DU’s body.</p><p>Thump! “Thump!”</p><p>The lion city’s body was as hard as diamond and it emitted a terrifying heat. However, under Lu Ming’s fist, it was still wailing in pain.</p><p>The crowd gasped. The lion Capital was actually at a disadvantage.</p><p>“I forgot to tell you that I’ve never been defeated in a battle of the same level. Not to mention that you’re one level lower than me!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was full of confidence.</p><p>On the side of the platform, the eyes of goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling flickered.</p><p>“Why do I feel that this style is very familiar?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang muttered.</p><p>I also find it familiar. There’s a kind of invincible confidence, just like Lu Shaoqing’s!</p><p>The pure spatial spirit said.</p><p>Lu Shaoqing seems to be very good at disguising himself. Could this person be Lu Shaoqing? ”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang seemed to have thought of something as she covered her mouth and whispered.</p><p>Jing kongling didn’t say anything and just looked at the battle.</p><p>“The sun is endless!”</p><p>The lion was suppressed by Lu Ming and felt extremely aggrieved. It roared madly, displaying its terrifying strength to the fullest.</p><p>It had to be said that the lion Capital was indeed very strong. They possessed 90% of the divine Sun lion’s bloodline, which was equivalent to a human martial artist awakening a ninth level divine level bloodline. Their battle prowess was extremely terrifying, and killing enemies who were several levels above them was as easy as eating and drinking.</p><p>If it were an ordinary peak second level spiritual God Realm martial artist or demonic beast, Lu Ming could kill them with a single slap.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s burst of third level spiritual God Realm vital essence, in addition to the seven streams of dragon energy and the support of the concept, could only gain the upper hand. It would take some effort to defeat him.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. It was so powerful with only ninety percent of the divine beast’s bloodline. How terrifying would it be if a pure-blooded divine beast came?</p><p>A 90% bloodline and a pure-blood Divine beast were fundamentally different. The difference was huge.</p><p>According to the ancient legends, there had once been a pure-blooded divine beast in the divine wilderness continent. A natural divine beast was invincible the moment it was born. No one in its generation was its match, and it could overpower its opponents.</p><p>Even if he was a Supreme talent who had awakened a ninth level divine bloodline, he was still far from being a match for him and would be suppressed.</p><p>It was said that a pureblood divine beast would be able to step into the Emperor realm with just a little bit of cultivation. Its talent was simply too strong.</p><p>However, in the divine wilderness continent, it had been many years since a natural-born pure-blooded divine beast was seen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
