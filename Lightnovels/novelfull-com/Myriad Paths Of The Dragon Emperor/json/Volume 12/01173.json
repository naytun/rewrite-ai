A few of them cultivated the mentality of tools, which was not of much use to Lu Ming. It did not improve his mentality at all.</p><p>...</p><p>After devouring a huge amount of energy, Lu Ming’s cultivation level was rapidly increasing. However, when he reached the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, his cultivation level stopped. No matter how much energy he refined, he could not absorb it. It could only dissipate and be wasted.</p><p>Because the essence realm of heaven and earth did not improve, his cultivation was stuck.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming decided not to devour the vital essence and energy. He only devoured the blood essence to improve his Blood Meridian.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had continuously devoured the blood essence of more than a dozen eighth and ninth level spiritual God Realm experts, and even perfected spiritual God Realm experts. His bloodline did not improve at all.</p><p>The bloodlines of the nine Dragons and the prison-suppressing stele were both at the eighth level of the divine level.</p><p>Advancing from level eight to level nine of the divine level was truly too difficult.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled bitterly. Could it be that he had to devour the blood essence of a Supreme-being in order to improve?</p><p>Lu Ming started to look around to see if any Supreme-being had been killed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill cry was heard as a cold-blood Hall Supreme was killed. Blood splattered everywhere and fell to the ground.</p><p>The blood contained a terrifying power. Some of the spirit embryo realm experts were splashed by the blood, and their bodies were immediately riddled with holes.</p><p>“Quickly retreat!”</p><p>Below, the troops from the myriad demons abyss and cold-blood Hall retreated in fear of being splashed by the blood.</p><p>“Blood essence of a Supreme Being!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were burning with passion.</p><p>“Little Qing, wait for me here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Xie nianqing warned.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and used his movement technique to rush toward the Supreme-being’s corpse.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A drop of Supreme-being blood shot toward Lu Ming like a blood-red shooting star, carrying a terrifying aura.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm, striking the drop of blood and dispersing it. However, Lu Ming also felt a tingling sensation in his palm, and a dull pain.</p><p>a Supreme martial artist is really powerful. This is just a drop of blood that flew around after his death, but it already has such a terrifying power and contains such a powerful energy. It’s a pity that my current heaven and earth will realm is not enough. Otherwise, I could refine this drop of blood and quickly improve my cultivation!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered to himself. Then, he ignored the blood and dashed towards the Supreme-being’s corpse in a flash. The nine Dragon bloodline opened its mouth and let out a long roar. The devouring power burst out, and nine drops of crystal-clear blood essence flew out from the Supreme-being’s corpse and were swallowed by the nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the nine drops of blood were swallowed by the nine Dragons, they exploded. Endless energy kicked around in the bodies of the nine Dragons. The bodies of the nine Dragons swelled up rapidly, like leather balls, and their volume expanded several times.</p><p>The energy within the blood essence of a Supreme martial artist was too powerful!</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and frantically controlled the nine Dragon bloodline to refine it.</p><p>He knew that he had been too impulsive. The power of the Supreme Being’s blood essence was simply too astonishing. Even with his current cultivation base, he had to refine it drop by drop. The most stable way was to devour all nine drops at once. The power of that kind of energy was simply too astonishing.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons circulated the power of refinement and began to refine the blood essence in his body.</p><p>Fortunately, he managed to withstand it and didn’t explode.</p><p>Slowly, the blood essence of the Supreme martial artist was refined and used to improve the bloodline of the nine Dragons.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>At this moment, a blood-red light flashed and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>A white-haired elder from cold-blood Hall with the cultivation of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm was Xue Luo Zi’s Guardian. He had his eyes on Lu Ming ever since Xue Luo Zi was killed. He took the opportunity to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. His third bloodline emerged, and killing intent gushed out like a tide.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm shattered his opponent’s blood-red light. The force of his palm was like a storm, surging towards his opponent.</p><p>Back then, outside the holy city, Lu Ming had the ability to kill an expert at the peak of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm. Now that a few months had passed, Lu Ming’s cultivation had increased to the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was stronger than a few months ago, and it was much easier to deal with an expert at the peak of the eighth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The other party was shocked. He did not expect that his surprise attack would be easily defeated by Lu Ming. At this moment, he exploded his essential core and threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on his fist, causing him to tremble and retreat rapidly.</p><p>“Kill, kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned blood-red and an endless killing intent enveloped the other party, causing him to shiver and his combat strength to weaken.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Activating the prison suppressing heavenly art, he struck out two palm strikes in succession.</p><p>The white-haired old man tried his best to catch the two palms, but his arm exploded, and he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The third bloodline turned into a blood-red sword. Under Lu Ming’s control, it turned into a blood-red light and pierced through the space between the eyebrows of the white-haired elder, killing him.</p><p>Hu hu hu!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flashed and he returned to Xie nianqing’s side. There was a Supreme-being by Xie nianqing’s side, which was enough to ensure their safety.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming sat cross-legged and focused on refining the blood essence.</p><p>The refining process took more than ten minutes before the blood essence energy in the nine Dragons ‘bodies finally calmed down. Under Lu Ming’s control, he opened his eyes and stood up.</p><p>The sovereign’s blood essence was still not completely refined, but there was no need to worry. He could slowly refine it.</p><p>At this moment, the situation on the battlefield was clear. Countless cold-blood Hall experts had been killed, and even a few Supreme martial artists had fallen. They were completely at a disadvantage. It was only a matter of time before they were defeated.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>At this moment, the space in the sky was constantly cracking. Lu Ming looked up and could barely see three figures fighting.</p><p>One of the figures exuded a demonic aura that soared into the sky. It was Mo Ye.</p><p>The other person was a woman with a graceful figure. She was shrouded by a Halo and her appearance couldn’t be seen clearly. She must be the sovereign of the floating mountain sect, Martial Emperor Yuexin.</p><p>The last person was covered in a bloody light. He was the blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>However, at this moment, the blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall was in a sorry state. His aura was weak, and one of his arms was missing. He had been severely injured by martial emperors ye and Yue Xin.</p><p>blood Emperor, you shall stay here today!</p><p>A cold voice filled with killing intent was heard. It was Martial Emperor Yuexin.</p><p>“You want to kill me? in your dreams!”</p><p>The blood Emperor’s cold voice rang out. A Crimson light suddenly flashed, forcing the moon Heart Martial Emperor and Mo Ye to retreat. He then turned into a streak of Crimson light and fled into the distance.</p><p>The blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall had escaped.</p><p>“You want to escape? dream on!”</p><p>Mo Ye shouted coldly and chased after them with Martial Emperor Yuexin, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Seeing the blood Emperor flee in defeat, the morale of the cold-blood Hall members plummeted.</p><p>“I surrender, I surrender!”</p><p>“I also surrender!”</p><p>The giant eagles from Sky Eagle Castle were the first to surrender. They had no sense of belonging to cold-blood Hall, so they naturally surrendered one by one when they saw the situation turn for the worse.</p><p>With the surrender of the giant Eagle, cold-blood Hall was at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Those who surrender and are willing to inscribe a formation in their sea of consciousness can be spared. Otherwise, they will be killed without mercy!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice could be heard from afar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
