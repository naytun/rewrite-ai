It was extremely terrifying and could kill an eighth level spiritual God in seconds. Lu Ming was really shocked.</p><p>“Don’t make a fuss. Let me tell you, if it wasn’t for the fact that this Lord’s strength is far from recovered, it wouldn’t be just that little bit of strength.”</p><p>I’m the divine turtle of the world, the head of the top ten war beasts. If I’m at my peak, I’ll be as large as a world in my true form. Even a Martial Emperor can be blown to death with a single breath, let alone a mere eighth level spiritual God Realm martial artist!</p><p>Dandan was proud of himself. He felt very comfortable when he saw Lu Ming’s expression of admiration.</p><p>“Could it be that you’ve surpassed the Emperor level at your peak?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>At this point, Lu Ming naturally believed that this was a rebirth of a super expert. Otherwise, it was impossible for him to have such means.</p><p>of course! Which one of the top 10 Battle Beasts isn’t invincible? martial emperors are nothing. Take your Nine Dragons bloodline as an example. If the nine Dragons were at their peak, they could devour the sun and the moon. Even the sun and the moon in the sky would be devoured by them. What martial emperors? they could devour a whole area with one bite!</p><p>Dandan’s face was full of confidence, then she sighed and said, ” “Other than me, I wonder if any of the top ten Battle Beasts have survived. That battle back then … AI!”</p><p>At the end of her sentence, dandan sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming pricked up his ears and listened carefully.</p><p>Now, with dandan’s recovery, his memory seemed to have recovered a lot. He might even be able to hear some secrets from him that no one knew.</p><p>Dandan cast a glance at Lu Ming and said,”sigh, I’m too weak. I need a good rest!” &Nbsp;</p><p>After saying that, he ran away and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>Then, he moved and appeared on another mountain peak. The two eighth level spiritual God Realm elders ‘corpses were still lying there.</p><p>A spirit God’s corpse would not rot even after a few years or even decades.</p><p>“Unfortunately, my true qi and blood Qi have already dissipated!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it and sighed slightly. He felt that it was a waste.</p><p>however, the blood essence should still be there. Even if a year has passed since the death of an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert, the blood essence should still be there!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. The nine Dragon bloodline emerged and the devouring power burst forth.</p><p>A total of eighteen blood essence pearls that looked like blood-red pearls flew out and were devoured by the nine Dragons. Lu Ming sat cross-legged and began to refine them.</p><p>The blood essence and power of the two eighth level spiritual God Realm martial artists were astonishingly rich. Lu Ming began to refine them with all his might.</p><p>Around the nine-Dragon bloodline, there were seven golden chakra, which were extremely dazzling.</p><p>As the power of blood essence was refined and integrated, the seven golden chakras shone more and more brightly.</p><p>After a moment, there was a sudden buzz and another pale golden chakra appeared.</p><p>The eighth golden chakra.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline had advanced by another level, advancing to the divine level rank 8 bloodline.</p><p>The bloodline of the nine Dragons roared, and its body rapidly grew in size and length. It was twice as large as before, and it was even more powerful and mighty.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>With a single thought, the nine Dragon bloodline shrank rapidly, turning into a ray of blood-red light that seeped into Lu Ming’s spine.</p><p>as expected, there’s an extra dragon energy. Wait, this dragon energy is so strong!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed a little and his eyes lit up.</p><p>The advancement of the nine Dragon bloodline also gave birth to one more dragon energy. However, Lu Ming felt that the eighth dragon energy was very powerful, comparable to the sum of the previous seven dragon energies.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had already discovered before this that each dragon energy would be stronger than the previous one. However, the extent of the strength was limited and not too exaggerated.</p><p>However, the eighth dragon energy was much stronger than the seventh.</p><p>an eighth-level divine level bloodline is indeed extraordinary. No wonder only those who have awakened an eighth-level divine level bloodline can be called second-grade prodigies in the central continent. A seventh-level divine level bloodline is much weaker than an eighth-level divine level bloodline.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>The stronger his dragon power was, the stronger his combat power would be when he used it.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to what kind of changes would happen when his nine Dragon bloodline advanced to the highest level, the ninth level of the divine level. How strong would his dragon energy be?</p><p>There was a huge difference between a level nine divine level expert and a level eight divine level expert.</p><p>The difference between a heaven’s favorite of a Big Shot and a second-grade heaven’s favorite could be seen.</p><p>If the nine Dragons bloodline and the prison-suppressing stele bloodline were both promoted to divine level nine, how powerful would Lu Ming’s combat strength be?</p><p>If Lu Ming were to unleash all his dragon power now, he would definitely be able to defeat the other powerful prodigies like dark Child and the three-headed hell hound easily and quickly.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming kept the two eighth level spiritual God Realm elders ‘storage rings. Then, with a wave of his hand, flames spread out and turned the two elders’ corpses into ashes.</p><p>“Who sent people to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows in deep thought.</p><p>At first, he thought that it was Xie Qitian who had sent people to kill him. However, those people said that they were going to kill Xie nianqing after killing him. This made Lu Ming speculate that it was not Xie Qitian.</p><p>If Xie Qitian wanted to kill Xie nianqing, he would have done so long ago. Why would he wait until now?</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that it was someone else who had sent someone.</p><p>“Could it be Xie Zhen? However, does Xie Zhen have such great power to mobilize an eighth level spiritual God Realm expert?”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered.</p><p>There were more than ten princes under Xie Qitian. Xie Qitian’s talent was average, so he might not have that much power.</p><p>there’s probably someone else helping Xie Zhen. Could it be Xie Qi Yu? ”</p><p>This was because only these two people wanted Lu Ming dead the most. At the same time, Xie Zhen had previously sent someone to assassinate Xie nianqing. Therefore, he was the most likely to be the one.</p><p>“Xie Zhen!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent. This person was someone Lu Ming had to kill.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lu Ming exited the mountain and river diagram and continued in the direction of the depths of the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming slowed down. Along the way, he encountered many Mosha clansmen who attacked him. They were all in the spirit embryo realm. There were those in the seventh, eighth, and ninth level of the spirit embryo realm, but Lu Ming easily killed them all. However, not a single point appeared on the Jade token.</p><p>did Xie Qitian lie to me? ”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes as he continued to fly.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming had no idea how far he had traveled. A city appeared in front of him.</p><p>From a distance, there were people on the city.</p><p>It was a human race martial artist, not a Mo Sha.</p><p>This should be a gathering place for humans. Lu Ming’s eyes lit up as he flew toward the city.</p><p>If there were people, they could ask them about Xie nianqing.</p><p>As Lu Ming approached, the people in the city noticed him and looked at him coldly.</p><p>“It’s the human race!”</p><p>On the city wall, someone muttered, his eyes bright.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Someone on the city wall asked.</p><p>“I’ve just entered the abyss demon territory. Please let me in!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>“I’m new!”</p><p>The eyes of the person on the city wall brightened.”Since you’re a human, come in!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He flew up the city wall and headed into the city.</p><p>This city wasn’t big, and there were even fewer people on the ground.</p><p>At a glance, other than the more than 100 people on the surrounding city walls, there were less than 200 people in the city. All of them were sitting cross-legged on the top of various buildings, as if they were cultivating or meditating.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
