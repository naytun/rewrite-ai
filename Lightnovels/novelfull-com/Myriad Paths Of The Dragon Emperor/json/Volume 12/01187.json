He kept striking out, but it was all in vain. He was crushed by the towering ancient tree, and in the end, the towering ancient tree heavily bombarded his body.</p><p>...</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor screamed and fell into the core Lake.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Baizhan Martial Emperor’s body smashed into the lake, and suddenly, a huge wave appeared in the lake. With baizhan Martial Emperor’s body as the center, the lake water rippled and madly rushed in all directions.</p><p>In a breath’s time, the water in the entire core Lake was sent flying for hundreds of thousands of miles, turning into steam and dissipating in the air.</p><p>With the baizhan Martial Emperor as the center, not a single drop of water could be seen within a 100000-mile radius. Everyone could only see him lying on the ground in the middle of the earth core Lake, coughing up blood.</p><p>At the scene, everyone from the royal family, the Xie family, and the heaven suppressing divine Army widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>A hundred-battle Martial Emperor was seriously injured by this black-robed middle-aged man with a single strike. How was this possible?</p><p>A battle-hardened Martial Emperor was the leader of the heaven suppressing divine Army. He was an expert at the peak of the divine wilderness continent. He was invincible and had won every battle.</p><p>This was how the name battle Martial Emperor came about.</p><p>But now, he had been defeated in one move. This was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Xie Sheng was also shocked and in disbelief. The hundred battle Martial Emperor was not weaker than him, but he had actually lost so badly. This made him feel a little apprehensive.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>In the distance, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. As expected of a third level martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“You’re overestimating yourself!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man looked down at the battle-tested Martial Emperor and said, ” “Now, are you going to hand it over or not? If you don’t hand it over, I can take it myself!”</p><p>There was a hint of killing intent in his voice.</p><p>His meaning was obvious. If the warring Martial Emperor refused to hand it over, he could kill him and take it himself.</p><p>The warring Martial Emperor’s expression was extremely ugly. He was extremely unwilling, but he was helpless in the face of such an invincible opponent. In the end, he let out a long sigh, took out a token, and threw it to the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>The black-robed man caught the token and glanced at it. A hint of joy appeared on his face, ” “It’s indeed the Heavenly King’s order!”</p><p>Although the divine Ruins continent was much stronger than the divine wilderness continent, it was still a speck of dust compared to the yuan continent. It was extremely difficult to join a large faction in the yuan continent. The Heavenly King token was also a Supreme treasure to him.</p><p>Sir, you are not from the divine wilderness continent, right? ”</p><p>Xie Sheng looked at the black-robed middle-aged man, his eyes filled with unwillingness.</p><p>Now that the Heavenly King token had fallen into the hands of the black-robed middle-aged man, the imperial family had no chance.</p><p>As soon as he said this, the hearts of the people from the royal family and the heaven suppressing divine Army were shocked.</p><p>If he was not from the divine wilderness mainland, could he be from overseas?</p><p>that’s right, I’m from the divine Ruins continent, God’s Gate South God Palace. You’ve lived for a long time, so you should have heard of it, right? ”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man explained as he put away the Heavenly King token. He seemed to be in a good mood.</p><p>“What? You are from the gate of God of the continent of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>Xie Sheng seemed to be very surprised. His expression changed, and then he became very respectful. He cupped his fists at the middle-aged man in Black and said, so it’s the experts of the gate of God. I’m sorry for not welcoming you. Please forgive me!</p><p>At the scene, the emperors had similar expressions as Xie Sheng. Other than shock, there was also a trace of respect.</p><p>When the battle Martial Emperor heard this, the unwillingness in his eyes finally disappeared, and it was replaced with helplessness.</p><p>As for those below the Emperor rank, their faces were filled with confusion.</p><p>“As expected, they are from the gate of God!”</p><p>Xie Luan muttered.</p><p>“Senior, is the gate of God very strong?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>of course it’s very strong. The primordial realm is vast and boundless. Of course, most of its territory is the sea. The sea is endless, and there are countless continents scattered across the endless sea.</p><p>some continents are not far from each other. When they gather in a region, they are called a group of continents, just like the islands in the ocean. Some islands are called islands when they gather together, and it is the same for the continents!</p><p>Xie Luan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. Outside the divine wilderness continent, it was really endless and beautiful.</p><p>and the sea region where the divine wilderness continent is located is called the divine Ruins continent cluster. It is made up of dozens of huge continents. Just from the name, you can tell that the divine Ruins continent is the most respected continent in this continent cluster!</p><p>the divine Ruins continent is vast, at least ten times the size of the divine wilderness continent. There are many experts, outstanding people, and the number of emperors is also much more than the divine wilderness continent. And the divine Ruins continent is completely ruled by one power, and that power is the gate of God!</p><p>Xie Luan continued to explain.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew how powerful the gate of God was.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was at least ten times the size of the divine wilderness continent, and it was completely ruled by a single force, the gate of God.</p><p>The so-called overlords of the divine wilderness continent were as weak as babies in front of the gate of God.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man, or rather, the warship, was from the gate of God.</p><p>I wonder what is the reason for our esteemed guest’s visit to the divine wilderness? ”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor flew up to the sky and cupped his fists respectfully. The Heavenly King token had been taken away by the experts of the gate of God, so he could only choose to forget about it.</p><p>I am here to bring good fortune to your divine wilderness continent!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Bring good fortune?”</p><p>Xie Sheng, the hundred battles Martial Emperor, and the rest of the people looked at each other in confusion.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a rumbling sound could be heard as the warship sailed over. At the front of the warship, a few figures appeared. There were young people and old people, and all of them had powerful auras.</p><p>“That’s right, good fortune, a great fortune!”</p><p>The black-robed man’s eyes suddenly lit up and he raised his voice, ” a few months ago, the gate of God suddenly received news from the yuan continent. The yuan continent’s tianshen sect is going to select young elites from the continent group of the divine Ruins and recruit them as disciples. The gate of God will do it on behalf of the sect and gather all the prodigies of the continent group of the divine Ruins together to head to the continent of the divine Ruins. At that time, an emissary from the tianshen sect will descend to select disciples!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s voice spread far and wide, causing a huge commotion.</p><p>“What? The major sects of the continent of the origin are selecting disciples in the continent of the divine Ruins?”</p><p>“Heavens, there’s actually such a thing? Since ancient times, the major sects of the yuan continent rarely choose disciples from the continent of the divine Ruins.”</p><p>“Good fortune, this is really a great good fortune!”</p><p>Even the sovereigns couldn’t remain calm. They were all discussing excitedly.</p><p>Thinking about it, it was understandable. A Heavenly King token could only allow one person to join the Heavenly King Hall, a major sect in the yuanlu continent. It had caused chaos in the central continent and caused the imperial family and the heaven suppressing divine Army to fight each other. From this, it could be seen how difficult and precious it was to enter a major sect to cultivate.</p><p>But now, without any token, a big sect in the yuanlu could directly recruit disciples. This was a great fortune.</p><p>Once they were accepted as disciples by the major sects of the yuanlu continent, they would have a meteoric rise and a bright future.</p><p>The cultivation environment of the large sects in the yuan continent was not something that the divine wilderness continent could compare to. It was countless times better.</p><p>If the divine wilderness continent was a stinky garbage dump, then the major sects of the yuan continent were the Supreme Immortals above the nine Heavens. There was no comparison at all. In that place, the Emperor realm was no longer the end point. There was a possibility of one reaching a higher level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
