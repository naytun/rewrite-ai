At this time, his face no longer had any cold and arrogant expression, only disbelief, shock, and disbelief.</p><p>He found it hard to believe that his most powerful attack, which he had used to fuse his blood meridians with, was actually defeated by Lu Ming in one move.</p><p>He could not believe that there was such a powerful person in the divine wilderness continent. Furthermore, Lu Ming’s bloodline was clearly only at the eighth level of the divine level.</p><p>He was not the only one. The others present were also shocked.</p><p>“My God, Lu Ming’s combat strength has become even more terrifying!”</p><p>he actually defeated a giant heaven’s favorite at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm in one move. With such combat strength, could he be able to compete with Long Chen? ”</p><p>“Maybe!”</p><p>Many people were talking about it, and even some emperors were shocked.</p><p>In the crowd, Long Chen’s expression was a little serious, which was rare. He stared at Lu Ming, but he quickly regained his calm and returned to his indifferent state.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>In Lion City, Ming Zi was equivalent to someone who had a grudge against Lu Ming. While he was shocked, he also gritted his teeth secretly.</p><p>Lu Ming had become stronger. The hope of them taking revenge and defeating Lu Ming had become slimmer.</p><p>Behind the black-robed middle-aged man, the smile on the young man’s face disappeared and was replaced by a serious expression.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man also revealed a surprised expression.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the cold and arrogant young man indifferently.”Is this your strength? is this the capital you have to be arrogant? You can’t even take a single move from me, how laughable. You keep calling me trash, then, what are you?”</p><p>His voice was indifferent and full of disdain.</p><p>“You … You … Brat, you’re dead!”</p><p>The arrogant young man’s face turned red and he let out an angry roar. He glared at Lu Ming coldly, wishing he could cut Lu Ming into eight pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. He took a step forward and, like a flash of light, his figure appeared in front of the cold and arrogant youth in an instant. He slapped him.</p><p>“You … You dare …”</p><p>The cold and arrogant youth was shocked. He did not expect Lu Ming to dare to attack again. In a hurry, he tried his best to block, but how could he block it? he was sent flying by Lu Ming’s slap.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming flew up and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He took seven consecutive steps, each one aimed at the cold and arrogant youth’s face.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Seven consecutive steps landed on the young man’s face, leaving a row of footprints on his face. The young man’s body was like a meteorite, directly falling into the core Lake.</p><p>With a boom, the cold and arrogant youth’s body fell into the geocentric Lake, causing thousands of waves. He could no longer be seen.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps were heard. Lu Ming was so bold. He wouldn’t have killed The Prodigy of the continent of Divine Ruins, would he?</p><p>The next moment, a ripple came from the core Lake, and the cold and arrogant youth rushed out.</p><p>At this moment, he was in an extremely sorry state. His hair was disheveled and his body was in tatters. His face, in particular, had a row of clear footprints. Blood was constantly flowing out of the corners of his mouth, eyes, and nostrils. It was truly a tragic sight.</p><p>ah, ah, bastard, I want you dead! Men, men, kill him! Kill him!</p><p>The cold and arrogant young man shouted hysterically.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>A cold voice rang out. It was the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s voice caused the arrogant youth to stop. elder, this person is extremely audacious. Quickly attack and kill him!</p><p>“I said enough!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man frowned and his voice turned cold. The cold and arrogant young man’s body turned cold and he didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>“They’ve already shown mercy. Otherwise, you would’ve been dead long ago. Don’t you find it embarrassing to make such a big fuss? Back down!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man berated.</p><p>The arrogant young man’s expression was extremely ugly. He glared at Lu Ming coldly and retreated with hatred.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming replied in a neither humble nor arrogant manner.</p><p>Lu Ming, very good. With your cultivation and combat strength, you are qualified to participate in the disciple selection of the deity sect. You can go to the divine Ruins continent with us!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>elder, but his bloodline is only at the eighth level of the divine level …</p><p>The cold and arrogant youth said.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man chided, forcing the arrogant youth to shut up.</p><p>to the big sects of the yuanlu continent, although bloodline is very important, it is not the only standard to determine talent. Other aspects are also very important!</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Senior, I’m sorry, I don’t want to go!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the black-robed middle-aged man.</p><p>Everyone was stunned by his words.</p><p>Lu Ming had the chance to participate in the selection of the major sects in the yuan continent. Now, he actually did not want to go?</p><p>Even the black-robed middle-aged man was stunned. He could not believe that someone would reject such an opportunity.</p><p>“Why not?” The black-robed man asked.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a glance at the cold and arrogant young man and said, the divine Ruins continent, if everyone is like this, then I don’t have to go!</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man smiled. He understood that Lu Ming was unhappy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the deity sect seems to be placing great importance on the selection of disciples this time. Once you are selected, you may be put in an important position. Also, the gate of God also places great importance on this selection. As long as you are selected by the deity sect, the gate of God will also reward you heavily.”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man looked at Lu Ming and smiled gently.</p><p>He was indeed stunned by Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>It was rare to see someone with an eighth level divine bloodline having such combat power.</p><p>“Also …”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man looked at the arrogant youth and said, ” “Mu Feng, apologize to Lu Ming!”</p><p>“What? Elder, you’re asking me to apologize to him? impossible, absolutely impossible!”</p><p>The cold and arrogant youth screamed.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The black-robed man’s eyes were sharp as he stared at Mu Feng.</p><p>Mu Feng’s expression changed drastically. He gritted his teeth and his expression kept changing. Finally, he gritted his teeth and stepped forward. He cupped his fists at Lu Ming and said, ” “Lu Ming, I was wrong just now!”</p><p>Then, he turned around and walked away.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how is it?” The black-robed middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Senior is so sincere, how can junior refuse?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>He had rejected the offer just now because he was unhappy, but he did not want to miss such an opportunity.</p><p>alright, then the twelve of you will board the ship with us and head to the divine Ruins continent together!</p><p>The black-robed man announced.</p><p>“Senior, please wait a moment. This junior still has one more thing to do, it will only take a cup of tea’s time!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again.</p><p>“Alright, it’s fine!” The black-robed middle-aged man was slightly taken aback.</p><p>“Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and turned around, his gaze fixed on one person.</p><p>Emperor God!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps. He approached the Emperor God in an instant and struck his palm at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
