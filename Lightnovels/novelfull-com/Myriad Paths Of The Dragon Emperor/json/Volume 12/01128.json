What a pervert!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk chanted a nondescript Buddhist name.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>Lu Ming had a vague feeling that Long Chen’s bloodline was not to be underestimated. It was definitely an extremely terrifying bloodline.</p><p>After defeating Tuoba Shi, Long Chen’s arm returned to its original state and he stood there calmly.</p><p>He was very ordinary, but no one dared to look down on him. Not even emperors. As long as such a genius did not die, he would definitely become an Emperor in the future. He might even rise to a higher level and dominate the divine wilderness.</p><p>Such a genius was rare even in ancient times.</p><p>Now, there were only seven people left on the platform.</p><p>The seven of them looked at each other!</p><p>“Yang potian, let’s fight!”</p><p>A five-colored light flashed, and Kong Lin appeared in front of yang potian.</p><p>Of the five Giants of the central continent, yang potian was ranked third, and Kong Lin was ranked fourth.</p><p>In the battle of Providence, Kong Lin lost to yang potian by a slight disadvantage. Today, he was going to win it back and wash away the shame.</p><p>“Then I’ll defeat you again!”</p><p>Yang potian was very confident. He pointed his halberd at Kong Lin, and the void trembled.</p><p>While Kong Lin’s body bloomed with five-colored light.</p><p>Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth-five elements!</p><p>The five elements Peacock was born with the ability to control the five elements and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Of course, this kind of control was different from a warrior who had comprehended five different concepts at the same time. This was because the five elements of the five elements Peacock were separated, unlike Lu Ming who had already fused all five.</p><p>The five elements Peacock was only blessed by the heavens in terms of controlling the five elements, while Kong Lin had ninety percent of the five elements peacock’s bloodline, so he naturally also inherited the talent to control the five elements.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them moved at the same time, charging at each other and engaging in a great battle.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming stepped forward and walked towards one of them.</p><p>Emperor God!</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the Emperor God!</p><p>The Emperor God stared at Lu Ming with a solemn look.</p><p>“You should go down!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Have I met you before?”</p><p>The Emperor God said as he stared at Lu Ming. He felt that his temperament was very similar to Lu Ming’s.</p><p>“Oh, really? Is there anyone in this world who is as invincible as me?”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned. His blood-red hair flew in the air as his endless killing intent swept toward the Emperor God.</p><p>although your combat strength is strong, you can’t do anything to me as I’m focused on dodging!</p><p>The Emperor God said. He was confident in his space will.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The blood-red long spear was thrust out like a blood-red lightning.</p><p>The space around the Emperor God’s body rippled like water. He moved and disappeared from his original spot, reappearing in another place 100 meters away.</p><p>the space mentality is indeed amazing, but in my eyes, it’s nothing!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and formed a seal with his hands. A door of light appeared, emitting a blinding light that pressed down on the Emperor God.</p><p>The Emperor God’s expression changed drastically because he suddenly felt like he had fallen into a quagmire and couldn’t move.</p><p>Not only him, even the space was sealed.</p><p>“This is … The nine seals of the gate of God!”</p><p>An Emperor suddenly stood up and exclaimed in shock.</p><p>it’s the nine seals of the gate of God, the ultimate martial art of the sky-sealing divine warrior. I didn’t expect Lu Shaoqing to be in control of it!</p><p>Another old Emperor said.</p><p>This ultimate technique was once famous in the world more than 100000 years ago. It was the ultimate technique of an Emperor. However, with the passing of that Emperor, this ultimate technique also disappeared in the world. No one expected it to appear again today.</p><p>The other onlookers were shocked. So this was an Emperor technique.</p><p>“Spatial travel!”</p><p>The Emperor God roared and exerted all his strength. The space around him trembled rapidly as he tried to break free from Lu Ming’s seal.</p><p>“Then one more fan!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved his hand and another gate of God appeared. It pressed down. This time, the Emperor God’s body could not move at all.</p><p>During this period of time, Lu Ming did not stop cultivating the nine seals of the divine Gate. After several months of hard work, Lu Ming could already form two of the nine seals of the divine Gate, and the sealing power had increased greatly.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The blood-red spear turned into a ray of light and pierced through the void, coming out of the Emperor God’s chest.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With a shake of the spear, the Emperor God’s body was sent flying far away. He flew out of the platform and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You can’t even withstand a single blow. I won’t kill you today for the sake of the sage Emperor, but I’ll definitely kill you when I meet you in the future!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>If it were not for the rule that no one was allowed to kill their opponent, he would have killed the Emperor God just now instead of just injuring him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care about the Emperor God anymore. He would have plenty of chances to kill him in the future.</p><p>The Emperor God kept vomiting blood and his face was pale. He barely managed to float in the air, staring at Lu Ming and roaring, ” “We must have met before. Who are you?”</p><p>Lu Ming did not spare him another glance. He turned around and looked at the battle between yang potian and Kong Lin.</p><p>Yang potian’s space intent was much stronger than an Emperor God’s, and he had also mastered other intents.</p><p>In the end, a purple-gold halberd floated above his head. The nine golden chakras were extremely bright.</p><p>Divine level ninth rank bloodline!</p><p>The geniuses of the big shots had all awakened divine level rank 9 bloodlines.</p><p>“Is this the legendary halberd of the void?”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Yang potian’s bloodline was the legendary Supreme divine weapon, the halberd of the void. It was a halberd that could shatter the void and cut through space.</p><p>Yang potian performed the bloodline fusion and transformed into the halberd of the void, which made his combat strength even more terrifying.</p><p>Kong Lin also turned into a five-colored peacock, but unfortunately, he was still no match for yang potian. After fighting for dozens of moves, Kong Lin was no match for yang potian and kept retreating, completely suppressed.</p><p>In the end, Kong Lin gave a long hiss and withdrew from the platform.</p><p>Kong Lin was defeated. Now, on the platform, there were only five people left.</p><p>Long Chen, Ming Zi, the heartless monk, yang potian, and Lu Ming.</p><p>Each one of them was extremely powerful with unparalleled combat strength.</p><p>The battle had also reached its most critical moment. As long as two more people were defeated, the top three would be decided.</p><p>“Among these five, who do you think is stronger and who is weaker?”</p><p>The crowd began to discuss.</p><p>Long Chen is, without a doubt, the strongest. He defeated Tuoba Shi, who wasn’t any weaker than yang potian, with a single punch. His combat strength is unfathomable. As for the other four, it’s hard to say!</p><p>I think that the unscrupulous monk, Dark Child, and Lu Shaoqing are about the same. As for yang potian, he’s slightly weaker!</p><p>“Not necessarily. Yang potian is very strong. He might not be weaker than the other three!”</p><p>I don’t think they’ll be weak either. The next battle will be the peak battle!</p><p>Everyone expressed their opinions one by one.</p><p>“I’m not a dog. Almsgiver, how about we exchange a few moves?”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk chanted the name of Buddha, and his white Kasaya fluttered as he flew towards yang potian, giving off a kind of otherworldly feeling.</p><p>that’s exactly what I want. Monk, you were the one who gave me a fake token in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. I’ll make you pay for this!</p><p>Yang potian coldly stared at the unscrupulous monk.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
