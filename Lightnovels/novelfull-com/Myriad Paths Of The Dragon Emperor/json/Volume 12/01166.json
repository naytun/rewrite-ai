Now that one of them had been killed by the royal family, they would definitely seek revenge.</p><p>Also, the Heavenly King’s token was a treasure that made all human sovereigns envious. Which sovereign wouldn’t be tempted?</p><p>Now that it had been obtained by the royal family, would the other emperors let it go?</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>The battle between the emperors had only just begun. What was to come would definitely be even more intense, and the fight for the Heavenly King token would be even more intense.</p><p>The royal family and the Xie family might not be able to keep the Heavenly King token.</p><p>Of course, this was more beneficial to Lu Ming. The royal family no longer had the time to take care of him. They were busy with their own affairs.</p><p>The most direct manifestation of this was that the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument had disappeared. It was obvious that the imperial family had stopped the operation of the heaven’s secrets instrument and wanted to spend more effort on how to protect the Heavenly King’s token.</p><p>“Fight, fight to your heart’s content!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, rose into the air, and flew toward the chaotic realm.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming flew into the territory of the chaos realm.</p><p>It had been almost two years since Lu Ming came to the chaos realm again. However, Lu Ming’s cultivation was no longer the same as before. The various forbidden areas and powerful existences in the chaos realm no longer posed a threat to him.</p><p>Lu Ming did not slow down at all and flew past at high speed.</p><p>Down below, a powerful being sensed the terrifying aura on Lu Ming’s body and immediately retreated. He did not dare to make any movements for fear of attracting a disaster.</p><p>Following Xie Luan’s guidance, Lu Ming flew for tens of millions of miles before he came to a Dark Mountain range.</p><p>At first glance, the mountain range was black and filled with demonic Qi. There were even demonic creatures roaming below.</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his altitude and flew forward.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>A few demonic beasts with thick demonic Qi howled and pounced at Lu Ming with a menacing glint in their eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and a few demonic beasts were crushed into pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a terrifying aura. Although the demonic beasts had low intelligence, they could still feel fear and retreated.</p><p>Lu Ming went all the way in and finally came to a pit.</p><p>This pit was a hundred miles in radius and was so deep that the bottom couldn’t be seen.</p><p>Demonic Qi continuously seeped out of the pit, extremely dense.</p><p>This was the place Xie Luan had mentioned.</p><p>With a flash of demonic Qi, Xie Luan appeared. Looking at the pit, he muttered,”It’s been 30000 years. I wonder how they’re doing? Let’s go!”</p><p>Having said that, he immediately jumped into the pit and Lu Ming followed suit.</p><p>The pit was very deep, and they only reached the bottom after descending for about a thousand miles.</p><p>At the bottom, there was a black magic stone with complicated runes engraved on it.</p><p>Xie Luan’s hands moved, and runes entered the demonic stone. The demonic stone began to glow, and finally cracked open, revealing a dark vortex.</p><p>A space gate!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this was a space gate.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xie Luan was the first to step into the spatial gate, followed closely by Lu Ming.</p><p>There was a flash in the space. In the next moment, Lu Ming found that they had appeared on the top of a mountain.</p><p>Looking up, there were vast mountains all around, and black demonic Qi filled the space.</p><p>This was a plane. The backup that Xie Luan had mentioned was actually a plane. Moreover, this plane was very similar to the abyss demon territory. Demonic Qi was surging, and the heaven and earth were filled with demonic Qi, but the heaven and earth spiritual Qi and original Qi were very thin.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s figure appeared with a flash of light between his eyebrows.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at the scene in front of him and was a little surprised.</p><p>back then, I was afraid that I would be suppressed or seriously injured if I failed, so I found this dimension and left some subordinates to guard this place and a place for me to recover. It’s been 30000 years. I wonder how it is now? ”</p><p>Xie Luan explained.</p><p>“Who’s there? You dare to barge into my myriad demons abyss!”</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout rang out. In the distance, dozens of figures flew over at top speed. Demonic Qi suffused their bodies-they were actually all spirit embryo realm martial artists.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of burly Men in Black armor appeared in front of Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>All of them were staring at them with cold eyes.</p><p>However, when their gazes fell on Xie Lun, their expressions changed drastically. Disbelief appeared on their faces, and they all cried out, ancestor devil! It’s the ancestor devil!</p><p>“How is that possible? The Fiend ancestor is still alive?”</p><p>One of them even waved his hand, causing a statue to appear. This statue looked exactly like Xie Luan, and it was filled with demonic Qi, as well as a domineering aura that seemed to be able to dominate the world.</p><p>“It’s really The Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>They shouted in disbelief.</p><p>“Where’s your commander? Call him over!”</p><p>Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>The dozens of armored men looked at each other with disbelief in their eyes.</p><p>The Fiend ancestor they were talking about was Xie Luan.</p><p>Obviously, they couldn’t believe that Xie Luan was still alive after thirty thousand years.</p><p>“Please wait a moment, we’ll go and report it now!”</p><p>One of the men with the highest cultivation said, then turned around and left.</p><p>The others quickly followed, turning into dozens of black demonic lights and disappearing.</p><p>However, after waiting for a while, there was no movement at all. No one came.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!” Xie Luan said, frowning.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing nodded and the three of them flew forward.</p><p>After flying over the mountains, an extremely huge city appeared in front of them.</p><p>At this moment, the four sides of the giant city were filled with experts. Armored warriors guarded the giant city as if they were facing a great enemy.</p><p>Among them, there were more than ten whose auras were extremely terrifying.</p><p>Supreme. These ten people were all Supreme-level powerhouses.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It seemed that the place that Xie Luan had left behind was not to be underestimated. There were actually so many powerful people.</p><p>Of course, these experts were not those people from 30000 years ago. They were definitely the descendants of those people.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming and the others arrived, all eyes in the giant city fell on Xie Luan, causing a commotion.</p><p>the devil ancestor! He’s exactly the same as the legendary devil ancestor!</p><p>“Could it really be the return of The Fiend ancestor?”</p><p>unbelievable!</p><p>One voice after another was heard, and they were all shocked.</p><p>The Supreme martial artists were especially shocked. Their auras grew stronger, and they stared at Xie Luan.</p><p>“Where is your commander? who is he? Tell him to come out and see me!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s brows furrowed even more, and his cold and commanding voice rang out.</p><p>No one answered, not even the Supreme martial artists. Their eyes flickered, and no one knew what they were thinking.</p><p>I am Xie Luan, the chaotic heavens divine warrior. Why aren’t you paying your respects? ”</p><p>Xie Luan’s loud shout caused many of the armored men to tremble.</p><p>how audacious! You actually dare to impersonate the chaotic sky divine warrior! You deserve to be killed!</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout came from the depths of the city. The sound shook the world and a demonic Qi rushed up into the sky, suppressing the surroundings.</p><p>An Emperor, this was the pressure of an Emperor.</p><p>There was actually an Emperor hidden here.</p><p>A tall, burly, and handsome figure stepped out of the demonic Qi and appeared in front of Lu Ming and the others. His eyes were fixed on Xie Luan, a little shocked, but more so, murderous.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
