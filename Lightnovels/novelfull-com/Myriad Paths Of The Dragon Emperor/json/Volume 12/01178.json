Why did you bring your men to my mountain piercing sect?”</p><p>...</p><p>The Emperor of the pangolin sect looked at qu Luo and asked loudly.</p><p>Emperor Wanshan, I advise you to lead the entire mountain-piercing sect to surrender. Otherwise, the mountain-piercing sect will be destroyed today!</p><p>Quluo said coldly.</p><p>“Haha, surrender? Don’t even think about it, quluo. I knew it. You’re a Wolf with wild ambitions. It’s useless even if you get help. At worst, we’ll fight to the death today!”</p><p>The myriad mountain Emperor let out a mocking laugh.</p><p>“If you don’t surrender, then fight!”</p><p>As soon as quluo finished speaking, his aura exploded and became even more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the side, Mo Ye also exploded. The might of an Emperor was vast and mighty. His demonic Qi formed a pillar of demonic Qi that shot up into the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Mo Ye and quluo stepped forward at the same time. The earth and sky trembled under their feet. Two terrifying demonic lights shot toward the mountain-piercing sect.</p><p>Two earth-shaking explosions were heard. The entire mountain-piercing sect shook violently as if there was a magnitude 10 earthquake.</p><p>The mountain piercing sect’s protective formation trembled madly. Under the bombardment of the two demon emperors, it finally could not resist and collapsed.</p><p>In Northern Plains, there were no cultivators who were skilled in the Dao of inscription, thus, the sect protecting formation was not very strong.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! as soon as the formation was broken, the myriad mountain Emperor roared and soared into the sky. Countless mountains appeared around him, and there seemed to be hundreds of them.</p><p>This was the myriad mountain Emperor’s domain, known as the myriad mountain domain.</p><p>“Wanshan, since you’re looking for death, I’ll send you on your way!”</p><p>die! qu Luo shouted coldly, and endless black demonic light spread out around him.</p><p>Devil domain!</p><p>At the same time, Mo Ye also released his demonic domain, and together with qu Luo, they charged towards Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>The Three Sovereigns immediately began an intense battle in the sky.</p><p>A terrifying fluctuation was emitted in the sky.</p><p>this quluo is so strong. He’s even slightly stronger than Mo Ye!</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Qu Luo’s combat strength was slightly stronger than Mo Ye’s, so he was able to gain the upper hand in just a few moves.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and the Army moved out, charging towards the pangolin sect.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The disciples of the mountain piercing sect also rushed out.</p><p>The two sides engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, a fiery red ray of light shot out. It was Yan kuangtu, who had his eyes on one of the Supreme-beings.</p><p>It was a three-meter tall man with bulging muscles. His entire body was emitting an earthy yellow light. He also stared at Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other party shouted, and a broad axe appeared in his hand, which he swung towards Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s body was covered in flames as he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The flaming Fist accurately hit the broad axe. The broad axe shook violently, and the tall and burly figure of the other party also shook violently, then retreated madly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s combat strength was unrivaled. Terrifying flames spread towards Lu Ming as he continued to bombard him with punches.</p><p>The other party tried his best to block, but with every move he blocked, he would be forced back a few steps. After a few moves, his body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock. They were both Supreme martial artists, but how could Yan kuangtu’s battle prowess be so strong?</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>He shouted as he executed the bloodline fusion. However, what awaited him was an even more violent storm of attacks from Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Yan kuangtu turned into a three-legged golden Crow. He flapped his wings and appeared in front of his opponent. He grabbed with his claws and broke the bloodline fusion. Then, his wings were like flaming heavenly blades, cutting his opponent’s body in half. Even the spirit God could not escape.</p><p>A Supreme martial artist had been killed just like that, shocking everyone in the surroundings.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>After that, Yan kuangtu turned his attention to another Supreme martial artist and charged towards him.</p><p>“Join hands, let’s join hands!”</p><p>The Supreme martial artist shouted and joined forces with another Supreme martial artist to fight Yan kuangtu, but they were still falling.</p><p>A few years ago, during the battle of ninedragons, Yan kuangtu was able to fight against three Supreme Masters alone.</p><p>Several years had passed, and although Yan kuangtu hadn’t broken through to the Emperor realm, he had made great progress. His battle prowess was much stronger than before, and he could easily suppress two Supreme martial artists.</p><p>In the end, another Supreme martial artist joined the battle and barely managed to stop Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“What a powerful Paragon!”</p><p>In the myriad demons abyss, the Supremes from the demon God Valley who had followed them here were all secretly shocked by the scene. They were shocked by Yan kuangtu’s strength, but they also knew that the force behind Lu Ming could not be underestimated.</p><p>With Yan kuangtu fighting several great masters alone, the others were much more relaxed.</p><p>Originally, the number of Supreme-beings on Lu Ming’s side was more than the mountain-piercing sect’s. As a result, it was completely one-sided.</p><p>the essence realm of the earth. There are many people in the mountain piercing sect who cultivate the essence realm of the earth. There are also other essences!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes started to shine.</p><p>Unlike cold-blood Hall, the mountain-piercing sect cultivated only one intent realm. Although the main cultivation realm of the mountain-piercing sect was the mountain and earth intent realm, there were many who cultivated other types of intent realms.</p><p>Fire concept, water concept, Thunder concept, wind concept …</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. His figure dashed out like a flash of light and appeared beside the pangolin sect’s powerhouses who had died in battle. The devouring power burst out and devoured the other party’s intent runes and blood essence.</p><p>“Refine, refine!”</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragon bloodlines and began to refine them frantically.</p><p>At the same time, his figure flickered and he rushed to another place.</p><p>Every time he devoured, he would sense it and feel that the other’s intent realm was in line with his. Only then would he start devouring.</p><p>As he devoured and refined the nine Dragons ‘bloodline, Lu Ming’s five intents began to improve slowly.</p><p>“A Paragon’s corpse!”</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming came to a Supreme-being’s corpse. It was the Supreme-being that Yan kuangtu had killed.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade bottle and used his essential core to draw out nine drops of blood essence that looked like resplendent blood-colored gemstones. He then stored them in the Jade bottle.</p><p>“I need to get more blood essence of a Supreme martial artist!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes darted around.</p><p>It was too difficult for him to improve his bloodline now. Previously, when he refined a Supreme blood essence, his nine Dragon bloodline did not improve at all. It was still at the eighth level of the divine level. However, Lu Ming had a feeling that his bloodline was improving after refining the Supreme blood essence and was approaching the ninth level of the divine level.</p><p>This meant that the Supreme-being’s blood essence was still very useful. He only needed a small amount.</p><p>As long as he had enough Supreme blood essence, his bloodline would advance sooner or later.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>All of a sudden, the mountain rocks beneath Lu Ming’s feet shook and a stone spear condensed. The sharp spear thrust out from under Lu Ming’s feet, aiming for his throat.</p><p>“Sneak attack!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. He did not Dodge or evade. His neck trembled slightly, and the five-colored concept revolved around him. He used the prison suppressing heaven technique, and a powerful force burst out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The stone spear immediately crumbled.</p><p>Lu Ming had long cultivated the prison-suppressing heaven technique to the point that he could attack every part of his body. He could even attack the throat. It was very powerful.</p><p>Attack as defense!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
