That guy called Minglu is finished. He’s been enveloped by the great dream of spring and autumn. The outcome has been decided!</p><p>that’s right. Once Liu Yuxin’s great dream of spring and autumn is used, the only thing one can do is to retreat. Once enveloped, one will fall into an Endless Illusion. Even the top five young warriors will be in danger. Liu Yuxin has won!</p><p>A few of the second-grade heaven’s favorites were discussing. They knew how terrifying Liu Yuxin’s dream was.</p><p>This was Liu Yuxin’s bloodline secret technique, which was very mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>After that, no one said anything. They just waited quietly.</p><p>In the gray fog, Lu Ming’s eyes were tightly shut. However, it was only two minutes before he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“Let’s end this!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a smile. He shouted softly and the scene of the talisman sect’s battle in front of him suddenly froze. Then, it shattered like a mirror and turned into nothingness.</p><p>Lu Ming was still standing on the platform. The gray fog surrounded him.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was like a sword. The five-colored will burst forth and he struck down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The earth shook and the gray fog rolled. It was constantly being destroyed by Lu Ming’s essential core.</p><p>In the next moment, Lu Ming took a step forward and rushed in one direction. He grabbed with his claws and a terrifying force suddenly exploded.</p><p>In this direction, the gray fog was obliterated, and Liu Yuxin’s figure appeared.</p><p>At this moment, her beautiful eyes were wide open, and her small mouth was open. Her face was full of disbelief.</p><p>His vital essence condensed into a huge hand and grabbed Liu Yuxin. Vital essence poured in and sealed all the major acupuncture points in Liu Yuxin’s body, making her unable to circulate her vital essence.</p><p>As Liu Yuxin was caught by Lu Ming, the surrounding gray fog dissipated.</p><p>When the crowd saw this scene, they were stunned.</p><p>Liu Yuxin was defeated and captured. What happened? ”</p><p>Earlier on, the gray fog had shrouded them. Many people did not see what had happened clearly and thought that Lu Ming would definitely lose. However, they did not expect to see this scene after waiting for two minutes and the fog had dissipated.</p><p>Some of the emperors and Supreme martial artists ‘eyes flickered, but they didn’t say anything.</p><p>They had obviously noticed something.</p><p>“Let me go!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin struggled with all her might in the Zhen Yuan hand, but with his Zhen Yuan sealed, how could he struggle with just his physical strength?</p><p>“Let you go? Hehe, did I forget what I just said?”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned, his eyes darting around Liu Yuxin’s body.</p><p>Liu Yuxin shivered. She glared at Lu Ming and said, ” “You … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>“Of course I’m going to beat you up!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mouth cracked into a smile and his beard trembled.</p><p>“You … Don’t you dare!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin glared at Lu Ming. Her threat was obvious.</p><p>“You still dare to threaten me? You’re looking for a beating!”</p><p>With a thought, he controlled his Zhen Yuan and grabbed Liu Yuxin. Then, he slapped a certain part of Liu Yuxin’s body.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm smacked heavily on it.</p><p>Silence!</p><p>The scene fell into a dead silence.</p><p>Countless people stared at the scene with their mouths wide open.</p><p>“He … He … He hit Liu Yuxin’s taxi …”</p><p>After a long time, someone finally stammered, but after a long time, he couldn’t continue.</p><p>They couldn’t believe it!</p><p>The unparalleled beauty, Liu Yuxin, had actually been beaten in public. This was simply unbelievable. How could this Ming Lu have such courage?</p><p>Liu Yuxin was one of the five most beautiful women in the central continent.</p><p>Of course, there were even more people who were envious, regardless of whether they were young or old. Some people were so envious that their eyes turned red.</p><p>She was one of the five great beauties of the central continent. They wanted to give her a slap and have a taste of her, but they didn’t dare to.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>kill! a loud roar was heard as a terrifying killing intent burst forth. A golden light shot up into the sky.</p><p>Shi du looked at Lu Ming with killing intent, wishing he could tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>As everyone knew, all the Lions had been pursuing Liu Yuxin. Since Lu Ming dared to treat Liu Yuxin like this, he naturally wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Liu Yuxin was stunned. She widened her eyes and stared at Lu Ming in a daze. After a long while, she let out an earth-shattering scream.</p><p>She was actually … By Lu Ming in front of everyone. This way …</p><p>She wished there was a crack in the ground and she could bury her head in it.</p><p>“You … You’re dead! I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Liu Yuxin screamed and struggled with all her might.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? You dare to threaten me, hit me again!”</p><p>Lu Ming berated him and slapped him again.</p><p>The crisp sound reverberated throughout the entire area.</p><p>All the onlookers ‘eyes were about to explode, especially the men. They were so envious that their eyes turned red. Some of them were so excited that they were trembling. It was as if they had replaced Lu Ming to teach Liu Yuxin a lesson.</p><p>“Commander … The commander …”</p><p>Tie Xing and the law enforcement Army were completely speechless.</p><p>They knew that Lu Ming was impressive, but this was too impressive!</p><p>Even some of the emperors and Supreme-beings at the table felt their eyelids Twitch and their hearts stir.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>One of the Supreme-beings from the tranquil illusion sect couldn’t take it anymore. He shouted, and the might of a Supreme-being filled the air.</p><p>However, they were immediately stopped by the Emperor of the youhuan sect. Today was the million-year sacrificial ceremony of the ancient Saint dynasty, and all the powerful cultivators had gathered. Moreover, Lu Ming and Liu Yuxin were having a fair battle on the battle stage. It was not appropriate for them to interfere.</p><p>“Ming, you’re dead!”</p><p>The golden light on Lion city’s body grew brighter and a terrifying killing intent enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Who are you? Shut up!”</p><p>shut up! Lu Ming looked at Shi du coldly and shouted. This made Shi du furious and he almost rushed out to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>In the end, he held back. With all the emperors gathered here, he did not dare to break the rules.</p><p>“You still dare to threaten me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned to Liu Yuxin again.</p><p>“Ah, I’m going to kill you …”</p><p>Liu Yuxin screamed.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Another slap landed, and Liu Yuxin’s screams came to an abrupt end.</p><p>As for the people who were watching, they were already numb.</p><p>This overpowered commander was simply too overpowered and heaven-defying.</p><p>He was completely lawless and audacious.</p><p>I’ve never heard of this Minglu before. He appeared out of nowhere. First, he suppressed Wu Cang. Now, he’s treating Liu Yuxin like this. To be honest, I’m impressed!</p><p>Said a heaven’s favorite. He looked simple and honest. Everyone recognized him as a heaven’s favorite from the soldier King’s residence.</p><p>“My hair is white, I am a little monk … I’m so envious!”</p><p>A Buddhist proclamation sounded.</p><p>Everyone was stunned, because the person who said that he was envious was an unscrupulous monk.</p><p>However, he was a monk. What was there to be envious of? did he want to give it a try? many people were speechless.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>The Buddha of the Western Desert called out the name of Buddha, seemingly embarrassed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
