All kinds of thoughts flashed through their minds, but most of them were exclaiming in admiration at Lu Ming’s ability.</p><p>...</p><p>“Brother Lu, you’ve kept us in the dark for so long!”</p><p>Outside the platform, goddess Tan Xiang spoke in a strange tone.</p><p>“I’m sorry, fairy. Lu Ming has no other choice!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and his voice spread throughout the entire area. Since he had been exposed, he should admit it.</p><p>it seems that it’s a great era now. Even the East barren has someone like Lu Ming!</p><p>that’s right. It’s a Golden Age. No territory can be underestimated. It’s possible for extraordinary geniuses to appear!</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s battle results were too dazzling.</p><p>Previously, Lu Shaoqing’s name had already shaken the entire central continent.</p><p>Recently, he had even transformed into the commander of the law enforcement Army and defeated Liu Yuxin, the divine Emperor, Lion City, the three-headed hell hound, and dark Child in succession.</p><p>Three of them were heaven’s favorites of the big shots!</p><p>This battle record was too brilliant.</p><p>“Lu Ming, Lu Ming, Lu Ming from the East barren!”</p><p>his powerful devouring power should be the talent of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Blood Luo Zi stared at Lu Ming, his eyes flickering. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>At the same time, many experts of the heavenly martial sword faction had killing intent flashing in their eyes. However, in such a situation, no one dared to show it.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a violent roar from the platform finally pulled everyone back from their thoughts. They shifted their gaze away from Lu Ming.</p><p>The battle between the unscrupulous monk and yang potian had also reached its final stage.</p><p>In the end, yang potian was no match for the monk. After exchanging a hundred moves, he was still defeated by the monk and thrown off the platform.</p><p>At this point, the top three were born!</p><p>They were long Chen, Lu Ming, and the heartless monk.</p><p>Many people were looking forward to it.</p><p>Right now, each of the three of them was terrifyingly strong and unfathomable.</p><p>Long Chen had always been the strongest heaven’s favorite. He was the first to become a spirit God and was unrivaled among his peers. Just now, he had defeated Tuoba Shi with a single punch, shocking everyone.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, the strange holy monk of the Western Desert, had defeated yang potian.</p><p>He was always smiling and had a harmless look on his face, making people feel that he was unfathomable.</p><p>Lu Ming could be considered the strongest Dark Horse this time. He had first transformed into Lu Shaoqing and the commander of the law enforcement Army. Along the way, he had defeated many experts and even a prodigy like dark Child. His strength was unfathomable.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to the clash between the three.</p><p>What everyone was looking forward to was whether Lu Ming or the unscrupulous monk could force Long Chen to reveal his true strength.</p><p>This was because no one knew how strong Long Chen was.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>The heartless monk chanted the name of Buddha and looked at Lu Ming, ” “Haha, benefactor, so your name is Lu Ming. It’s a pleasure to meet you!”</p><p>“Monk, we’ve met several times!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>haha, that’s right, that’s right. Almsgiver Lu’s combat strength is so profound that it’s really admirable. I didn’t expect you to defeat Dark Child. I’ve had many battles with Dark Child in the past, but I couldn’t defeat him. Since you can defeat him, I’m no match for you. I admit defeat, I admit defeat!</p><p>The monk chuckled and turned around. He left the platform in a carefree manner.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk had admitted defeat. In this case, only Lu Ming and Long Chen were left.</p><p>the bloodline of the nine Dragons? interesting. I’d like to see the power of the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Long Chen, who had been silent all this while, finally spoke. He looked at Lu Ming with a hint of anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>This kind of anticipation was like the anticipation of someone who had been invincible for too long and had no opponents.</p><p>That’s right, Long Chen had been invincible for far too long. He was unrivaled among the younger generation. He needed an opponent, and he desired one.</p><p>Without a doubt, in his heart, Lu Ming could possibly be his opponent.</p><p>This wasn’t arrogance, but his true thoughts.</p><p>I want to fight with you. Unfortunately, I’m not interested in the first place!</p><p>After saying that, Lu Ming moved and floated off the platform.</p><p>Lu Ming’s goal was to come in second or third. He did not want to come in first at all.</p><p>The winner would have to marry Xie nianlin.</p><p>Lu Ming only wanted the second or third place and the sacred Emperor to agree to one condition.</p><p>“Lu Ming actually admitted defeat. What a pity!”</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>They had thought that they would be able to see a peak battle, but the result was unexpected.</p><p>First, the unscrupulous monk admitted defeat. Then, Lu Ming also admitted defeat.</p><p>Thus, the competition was over.</p><p>alright, the competition ends here. Long Chen has won first place. He will be engaged to my daughter, Xie nianlin, soon!</p><p>Xie Qitian stood up and announced.</p><p>Beside Xie Qitian, Xie nianlin was smiling happily.</p><p>On the platform, Long Chen turned to look at Xie nianlin with a smile on his face.</p><p>Not many people knew that Long Chen and Xie nianlin had long since developed feelings for each other and were secretly dating.</p><p>The competition this time was just a formality. Xie nianlin, Xie Qitian, and the others all knew that Long Chen would take first place without a doubt. No one could defeat him.</p><p>Xie Qitian could also take this opportunity to establish a good relationship with the various Overlord forces, killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>from now on, the heavenly Sun Palace and the Royal Xie family will be married. The royal family will become even more powerful!</p><p>Someone sighed in the dark.</p><p>Long Chen was from the heavenly Sun Palace, an extremely powerful Overlord force.</p><p>With Long Chen and Xie nianlin’s Union, the two forces would definitely have to work together in the future.</p><p>there are many heaven’s favorites in the royal family. Xie nianjun, Xie nianlin, Xie Yan, all of them are top heaven’s favorites. Is the royal family going to return to glory? ”</p><p>the royal family is indeed powerful. In the future, they will have a marriage alliance with the sun Sky Palace and gather the two strongest heaven’s favorites. It is indeed possible for them to rise. However, the other forces may not let them rise as they wish!</p><p>In the dark, some people were whispering to each other.</p><p>The marriage between the imperial family and the heavenly Sun Palace had a far-reaching impact.</p><p>“Also, Lu Ming, the heartless holy monk!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming and the heartless monk.</p><p>The two of them flew up to the platform and saluted Xie Qitian.</p><p>“I’ll agree to one condition for the second and third place. What do you want? Lu Ming, you go first!”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s gaze shifted to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. They had finally arrived. He had been waiting for this moment.</p><p>The Masters of the Wang family, the Jiang family, the divine Emperor, and the others were all on tenterhooks.</p><p>If Lu Ming suggested that the sacred Emperor protect him against Di Yi, it would be troublesome. Di Yi could not do anything against the ancient sacred dynasty.</p><p>“Sage Emperor, Lu Ming has nothing else to ask of you. I only ask that you set nianqing free!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xie Qitian frowned.</p><p>At the scene, the others were also stunned.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming would ask for some peerless cultivation technique, martial arts technique, or treasure from the royal family. They had never expected that Lu Ming would make such a request to the sage Emperor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
