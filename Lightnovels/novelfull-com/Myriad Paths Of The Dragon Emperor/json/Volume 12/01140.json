The middle-aged man suspected that he was dreaming.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming looked so young. His combat strength was simply unimaginable.</p><p>“Big brother, it’s settled!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and kept the nine Dragons bloodline. He split a part of his attention to begin refining.</p><p>“Small … You’re amazing, you’re really amazing. I’m impressed!”</p><p>The middle-aged man stuttered and sighed.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not say much.</p><p>I’m du Shan. What’s your name, little brother? ”</p><p>The middle-aged man said.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming answered.</p><p>brother Lu, I have something important to do. I can’t accompany you anymore. Little brother, you have to be careful!</p><p>After du Shan finished speaking, he was about to fly in a direction.</p><p>“Big brother du, what do you want? Maybe Lu Ming can be of help!”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped du Shan. It was not easy for them to meet another human warrior. Lu Ming was just about to ask him about Xie nianqing. How could he let du Shan leave so easily?</p><p>ah, the human clan’s gathering place I’m at is being attacked by the devil clan. I received the news and wanted to rush back to help, but I didn’t expect to be blocked by the devil clan here!</p><p>Du Shan sighed and was slightly anxious.</p><p>“A gathering place of the human race? I’ll go with you!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Alright, with little brother’s help, we might be saved!”</p><p>Du Shan’s eyes also lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was unfathomable and extremely powerful. He had the intention to ask Lu Ming for help, but Lu Ming had just saved his life and asked him to take the risk with him. He was too embarrassed to ask. Now that Lu Ming had taken the initiative to ask, he was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>At that moment, du Shan led the way while Lu Ming followed du Shan. They flew at top speed towards the North.</p><p>After flying for hundreds of thousands of miles, he heard heaven-suppressing battle cries.</p><p>In the distance, a fortress made of a strange metal could be seen. Around the fortress, an intense battle was taking place.</p><p>There were over a thousand of them, surrounding the fortress.</p><p>Among them, there were many existences with powerful auras. Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan and discovered that there were dozens of spiritual God-level Mosha clan members. The rest were advanced-stage spiritual embryo Mosha clan members.</p><p>There were only a few people in the fortress, about twenty or so, and all of them were spirit God powerhouses. They were fighting against the devil clan, but they were clearly at a disadvantage.</p><p>“Human, go to hell!”</p><p>With a shrill scream, one of the mo Sha clansmen had a particularly powerful aura. He held a black and sharp bone spur in each hand, and his body was like a lightning bolt as he charged toward a human expert.</p><p>The human expert had a cultivation of the third level of the spiritual God Realm. However, he was unable to put up any resistance against the devil clan. The bone spike pierced through his glabella, and he was killed without even being able to let out a miserable cry.</p><p>Peak fifth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this person from the demonic Sha clan had a cultivation at the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. He was the strongest existence in the demonic Sha clan. As for the human martial artists, the strongest was only at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Damn it, kill!”</p><p>When du Shan saw this, he shouted and charged forward with his battle axe.</p><p>“Another one is here to die!”</p><p>The fifth level spiritual God Realm fiend Clansman’s eyes were cold as he swept his gaze at du Shan. He sneered and his demonic Qi rolled. He flapped his pair of spikes and pounced toward Lu Ming like lightning.</p><p>A battle-ax floated above du Shan’s head. It was du Shan’s bloodline, a fourth level divine level bloodline. Du Shan transformed into a battle-ax and slashed at his opponent.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>Two crisp sounds rang out. The battle axe that du Shan had transformed into was sent flying far away.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The devil clan member shrieked. The bone spike in his hand was thin and long, but it was extremely hard and sharp. It seemed to be able to pierce through everything as it stabbed towards du Shan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Two teeth-numbing sounds rang out as the bone spikes of the mo Sha clan pierced through the battle-ax du Shan had transformed into.</p><p>An angry roar came from the battleaxe. The battleaxe trembled and dispersed, turning back into du Shan’s figure. His face was pale as he retreated quickly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The devil Clansman’s eyes were cold. The bone spur pierced through the air, aiming for du Shan’s forehead.</p><p>Right at this moment, a palm that was like a blade suddenly appeared and slashed at the bone spike. A terrifying power erupted, and the bone spike was broken into dozens of pieces with a clang.</p><p>The palm blade cut horizontally and struck the shoulder of the demon Sha.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The devil Clansman’s shoulder exploded, and he was sent flying like a cannonball, killing a few spirit embryo realm devil clansmen.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared, and the devouring power burst forth, enveloping the Mosha clansmen.</p><p>The energy and blood essence of the spirit embryo realm demons were instantly devoured, turning them into dried corpses.</p><p>The first, second, and third level spiritual God Realm demons screamed in horror and turned into mummies under the devouring power.</p><p>The human warriors were all stunned.</p><p>As for the remaining Mo Sha clansmen, they roared madly and wanted to escape. However, under the terrifying devouring power, they felt as if they were stuck in a quagmire and could not move at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming rushed past them and cut down all the Mosha clan members as if he was cutting grass.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The fifth level spiritual God Realm Mosha Clansman was only injured but not dead. He flapped his wings and turned into a demonic light, trying to escape.</p><p>He knew that a top human expert had come, and that one move had severely injured him. If he didn’t escape, he would die.</p><p>However, he was shocked to find that he could not escape at all.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was like a flickering light and a passing shadow. He caught up with the fifth level spiritual God Realm Mosha clan in an instant and appeared behind him.</p><p>let’s die together! Torrential rain massacre!</p><p>Seeing that they couldn’t escape, the devil Clansman let out an angry roar. His demonic Qi soared into the sky, and he spread his wings. His entire body began to spin in the air.</p><p>Its wings were like two sabers that cut through the air, bringing with them a storm of attacks. It was like a terrifying tornado that could destroy everything as it swept towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Two streams of dragon power burst forth in Lu Ming’s body. He then executed the prison-suppressing heaven technique and struck down with his palm.</p><p>This palm strike was like a heavenly blade, possessing the power to suppress everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The storm of attacks from the Mosha clan collapsed instantly. The palm blade landed on the body of the Mosha clan, killing him. All his energy and blood essence were devoured by Lu Ming.</p><p>In the castle, the humans ‘eyes were wide open, as if they had yet to react.</p><p>“Brother Lu Ming, thank you for saving me again. Otherwise … Sigh!”</p><p>Du Shan walked over to thank Lu Ming, his voice full of emotion.</p><p>If not for Lu Ming, he would have been dead.</p><p>At this time, the human warriors in the castle finally reacted and flew over to thank him.</p><p>They were even more shocked when they saw that Lu Ming had such combat abilities at such a young age.</p><p>I’ve heard that there are many heaven’s favorites in the outside world. The five magnates are the most powerful ones among the young generation. But in my opinion, brother Lu, I’m afraid you’re even stronger than the five magnates!</p><p>An old man with white hair sighed.</p><p>Every year, some people would be exiled here by the royal family. They had stayed in the demon Realm for a long time, so they knew some things about the outside world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
