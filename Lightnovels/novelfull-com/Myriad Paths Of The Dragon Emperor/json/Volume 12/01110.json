If they retreated, they would lose all their face.</p><p>They glared at Lu Ming coldly, their eyes filled with killing intent. They could not wait to cut Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>The reason for this situation was all because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Just as the two sides were confronting each other, in the distance, a golden light filled the air and shot towards them. The speed was so fast that it exceeded people’s reaction time. Many people had only just reacted to the golden light when it had already appeared in front of them.</p><p>A dignified middle-aged man with his hands behind his back appeared in the air.</p><p>He was wearing a Golden Dragon robe, a golden crown, and Golden Boots. A majestic and vast aura was released from his body, making it difficult for everyone to breathe. It was as if they were facing a human King inspecting the world.</p><p>“Imperial uncle!”</p><p>Upon seeing the middle-aged man, Xie Zhen exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled. The Imperial uncle that Xie Zhen addressed must be the younger brother of the current Sage Emperor.</p><p>The important figures of the royal family and the Xie family had appeared.</p><p>“It has appeared!” Lu Ming’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Today’s incident had caused such a huge commotion. Lu Ming was certain that the royal family and the Xie family would definitely send someone to protect the dignity of the royal family.</p><p>After all, even though the ancient Saint dynasty was weak, it still had its foundations and was still the most powerful force in the central continent.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s Imperial uncle looked at Xie Zhen and nodded his head, ” “You, not bad!”</p><p>Then, he looked at the three elders of the heavenly martial sword faction and said, ” the rules of the sacred city State that no one is allowed to kill innocent people in the sacred city. If you have any grudges, you can go up to the battle platform. No one cares about your life or death. However, if you kill someone for no reason in the sacred city, you are disregarding the dignity of the ancient Saint dynasty. The law enforcement Army has the right to enforce the law. The disciples of the heavenly martial sword sect have committed a crime despite knowing the truth!</p><p>A majestic voice came from Xie Zhen’s Imperial uncle’s mouth and spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled, but then they came to a realization.</p><p>The one-million-year period of the ancient Saint dynasty was drawing to a close, and the matter had been blown up to such an extent. The royal family of the Xie family had to uphold the dignity of the royal family. If they were to compromise with the tianwu sword faction today, the royal family would be trampled on by others in the future, and they would be even weaker than before.</p><p>If today’s matter had not blown up and the powerhouse from the heavenly martial sword faction had slapped Lu Ming to death, then everything would have passed without a ripple. But now that the matter had blown up, the royal family and the Xie family had to support the law enforcement Army.</p><p>The three elders of the heavenly martial sword faction had ugly expressions on their faces. They knew this very well.</p><p>“Then what do we have to do to release him?”</p><p>The three elders of the heavenly martial sword faction looked at each other, and one of them spoke. It was obvious that he had given in.</p><p>“The law enforcement Army naturally has its own rules. You can discuss with the commander of the law enforcement Army what to do!”</p><p>The middle-aged Royal uncle said.</p><p>I’ve already stated my conditions. Let’s do it that way. If you’re guilty, you should be punished!</p><p>Lu Ming narrowed his eyes and smiled.</p><p>The three elders of the sky martial sword faction looked extremely gloomy. After pondering for a while, one of them took out a storage ring and waved it a few times before throwing it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming caught it and scanned it with his spiritual sense. His face darkened and said, why are you missing 500000? you don’t want this guy anymore? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pointed at the disciple of the sky martial sword faction that he had killed.</p><p>“You’ve already killed him, and you still want to keep him?”</p><p>An elder of the heavenly martial sword faction said in a deep voice.</p><p>“A corpse is still a human. If you don’t want his corpse, I’ll throw it out to feed the dogs!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The elder’s eyes were filled with killing intent, but Lu Ming looked at him indifferently, without the slightest fear.</p><p>In the end, the heavenly martial sword faction had no choice but to give in. For the sake of their reputation, they could only take out another five hundred thousand orirocks.</p><p>“You trash, take them away!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand. Wu Cang and three other disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction flew into the air.</p><p>An elder waved his hand and took it. He stared at Lu Ming coldly and said, you, very good, very good. I hope you will stay in the holy city forever, in the law-enforcement Army!</p><p>With that, he snorted coldly, turned into three sword lights, and disappeared.</p><p>Hu! “Hu!”</p><p>The crowd of onlookers let out a long sigh of relief. There was still a look of disbelief in their eyes.</p><p>This matter had actually ended like this.</p><p>The elder of the heavenly martial sword faction had come with a strong force, but in the end, he had left with his tail between his legs, leaving behind a few million raw stones. No one had expected this to be the result.</p><p>Everyone’s gaze eventually landed on Lu Ming, this impressive commander.</p><p>Before this, no one would have paid any attention to a mere commander of the law enforcement Army. However, he had now attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>First, he used his strong combat strength to suppress Wu Cang.</p><p>Later on, he even blocked an attack from a fourth level spiritual God Realm expert. Although Lu Ming used a treasure, it also proved his powerful combat ability.</p><p>But what was more important was his courage and his mind.</p><p>He dared to go up against an elder of the heavenly martial sword faction alone, and was skilled at using the power of the royal family, the Xie clan, and even the ancient Saint Emperor who had created the law enforcement Army to force the elder of the heavenly martial sword faction to retreat in defeat.</p><p>He really couldn’t believe that all of this had been done by this bearded man.</p><p>With such means, if he was ten years younger, he would be able to compete with all the heroes in the world.</p><p>“Zhen ‘er, let’s go!”</p><p>In the air, the middle-aged Royal uncle glanced at Xie Zhen, then his gaze fell on Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>The middle-aged Imperial uncle asked.</p><p>“Bright Road!” Lu Ming replied in a neither humble nor arrogant manner.</p><p>“Bright Road? Good, you’re very good!”</p><p>The middle-aged Imperial uncle said ” good ” a few times, then waved his hand and left.</p><p>“Malicious intent towards me?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the sky, deep in thought.</p><p>The middle-aged Imperial uncle said ” good ” several times. Lu Ming did not feel the slightest bit of kindness. Instead, he felt malice.</p><p>After a few thoughts, Lu Ming’s face revealed a cold smile.</p><p>He could roughly guess why the middle-aged Imperial uncle had ill intentions towards him.</p><p>Right now, the ancient Saint dynasty wanted to form an alliance and work together with some of the overlords to increase their strength.</p><p>However, although Lu Ming’s actions today seemed to have protected the dignity of the royal family, he had also offended the heavenly martial sword sect. Furthermore, he was forcing the royal family to offend the heavenly martial sword sect. In the future, it would be even more difficult for the royal family to befriend the heavenly martial sword sect.</p><p>The middle-aged Imperial uncle naturally did not have a good impression of Lu Ming.</p><p>In his heart, he could not wait to kill Lu Ming, this meddlesome person, with one slap.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He didn’t mind. After all, he had joined the Imperial Dragon guards and then the law enforcement Army only because he wanted to use this identity to investigate Xie nianqing’s whereabouts. Once he found Xie nianqing, he would just leave without a word. Who would be able to find him?</p><p>“Mighty, mighty commander!”</p><p>At this time, the most excited ones were the law enforcement Army. Each and every one of them was so excited that they were trembling all over, as if they had eaten a large Iced Watermelon in the hot summer.</p><p>They were usually too aggrieved, but today, they were able to hold their heads up high. Didn’t you see that even a hegemon force like the heavenly martial sword sect admitted defeat in front of the law enforcement Army, compensated a large number of raw stones, and left in dejection?</p><p>This kind of pleasure was brought about by a sudden outburst after being suppressed for a long time. It was simply better than doing anything else.</p><p>Tie Xing even shouted excitedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
