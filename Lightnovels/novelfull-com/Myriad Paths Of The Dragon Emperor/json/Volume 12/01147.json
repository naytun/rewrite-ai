If I come out, I can pass on all my skills to her. With her talent, she will become an Emperor in the future. She might even surpass me in the future!</p><p>...</p><p>The demon Empress continuously tossed out temptations. Moreover, they were all temptations that were difficult to refuse.</p><p>The legacy of a demon Empress was definitely a great temptation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you decide!”</p><p>Xie nianqing held Lu Ming’s hand and said.</p><p>“Little Qing, it wasn’t easy for me to find you, so how could I take you on an adventure? you don’t have to take these worldly possessions!”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and was about to walk back.</p><p>“Come back, what are you doing? Or do you not trust me? I, Xie Luan, am actually the kind of person who goes back on his word?”</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were about to leave, the demon Emperor panicked and shouted continuously.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing shuddered at the same time. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Xie Luan? Xie Luan, the sovereign of chaos? How was that possible?</p><p>The two of them turned around again and looked at the huge stone tablet.</p><p>“You’re Xie Luan?”</p><p>Xie nianqing opened his mouth, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Xie Luan, the unparalleled figure of the Royal Xie family 30000 years ago, was also a taboo of the Royal Xie family. With his power alone, he had changed the entire central continent’s situation from the ancient Saint dynasty to today’s divided lands.</p><p>He was an alien bloodline of the Xie family, just like Xie nianqing!</p><p>However, this was a figure from 30000 years ago. How could he still be alive?</p><p>“That’s right, I’m Xie Luan, the sovereign of the chaotic heavens. Nuwa, your bloodline is very similar to mine, and you’re also a variant of the Xie clan’s bloodline, right? Hehe!”</p><p>The demon Empress smiled meaningfully.</p><p>“Impossible. As far as I know, emperors can only live for ten to twenty thousand years at most. If you are Xie Luan, how could you still be alive?”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>When the stele floated up, he had sensed the aura of life, not just a wisp of mark, which meant that Xie Luan was still alive.</p><p>How could an Emperor live for thirty thousand years?</p><p>it’s all thanks to the prison-suppressing stele. It suppresses my body and slows down the flow of my life by several times. 30000 years is only about 10000 years for me. If I’m suppressed for another 30000 years, I’m really going to disappear!</p><p>The demon Empress explained with a sigh.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was still uncertain.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what this person said should be true. I can sense that this person is from the same bloodline as me. Our bloodlines are very similar!”</p><p>Xie nianqing whispered to Lu Ming.</p><p>Was the other party really Xie Luan?</p><p>The two of them were still unable to calm down.</p><p>It was said that Xie Luan had rebelled and fought a Great War with the imperial family. The battle was earth-shattering, and countless experts of the imperial family had been killed by Xie Luan. In the end, Xie Luan had still been defeated and killed by the experts of the imperial family.</p><p>Could it be that Xie Luan did not die, but was instead suppressed here?</p><p>hehe, back then, no one in the royal family could kill me. They could only suppress me here with the help of the prison-guarding stele, hoping that time would kill me. But they didn’t expect that although the prison-guarding stele suppressed me, it also slowed down the loss of my life by several times!</p><p>“Boy, you and this girl from the Xie family must have been exiled here by the royal family, right? I can imagine that after what happened to me that year, the royal family and the Xie family must be more than ten times more wary of foreign bloodlines. I’m surprised that they didn’t kill you directly!”</p><p>The demon Empress continued.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were silent.</p><p>“Do you want to be exiled to the demon Realm of hell forever? As long as you let me out, I’ll take you and break out of the abyss Demon Realm. Don’t worry, I’ve always been a man of my word, and I’ll always repay kindness and hatred!”</p><p>The demon Empress continued.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were moved by his words.</p><p>It was even more tempting than getting the prison-suppressing stele or the demon Emperor’s inheritance.</p><p>The biggest problem they were facing now was how to get out. It was obvious that Xie Qitian wanted to exile them here for the rest of their lives, trapping them in the abyss demon territory.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still had many things to do.</p><p>Di Yi had besieged Mount Liangyi. His family and friends were all at Mount Liangyi. He had to get out.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll let you out!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming decided to take a gamble.</p><p>This was their only chance.</p><p>alright, you just need to control the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele and take it. That will do!</p><p>The demon Emperor’s voice rang out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate anymore. With a thought, the prison-suppressing stele bloodline emerged.</p><p>As soon as the prison-suppressing stele bloodline appeared, it had a strong connection with the huge stele. It grew rapidly, shook continuously, and emitted a bright light.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and controlled the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline, trying to put the huge stele away.</p><p>Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>The giant stone tablet kept shaking. The word ‘tablet’ on it was glowing and it was almost identical to the word on the prison suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Be it the strokes or the aura, they were all the same.</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that this was the true form of the prison-suppressing stele. It was a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>The fragment of the prison-suppressing stele slowly floated up and rose into the air.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the sky below. The burly figure appeared again, and a vast demonic might filled the sky.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted. The fragment of the prison-suppressing stele shook and flew into the sky with a loud bang.</p><p>However, the demonic shadow below also flew out with the prison-suppressing stele and entered it. One could see that a huge demonic shadow was trapped in the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little surprised.</p><p>ah, I’ve been suppressed by the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele for too long. My demonic body is almost obliterated, and my demonic power is almost exhausted. The aura of the fragment and I have almost become one. Even if the fragment leaves the ground, it’s still suppressing me. I can’t get out unless I recover my cultivation to the Emperor realm!</p><p>The demon Emperor, Xie Luan, sighed.</p><p>“I see. Then how will you help us get out of the abyss Demon Realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>it’s simple. You just need to merge the fragment with your blood and put it in your spine. Then, you’ll have initial control over it. As long as you withdraw the suppressing power, I can get out of it. However, I can’t go too far away from the fragment, or I’ll still be suppressed by the suppressing power!</p><p>Xie Luan explained.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and began to control the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele to merge with the fragment.</p><p>A moment later, the bloodline of the prison-guarding stele merged with the fragment.</p><p>At this moment, the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele shrunk rapidly and merged with the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>He could clearly see that the lower part of the bloodline was shining like a real entity, taking up about one-third of the area, while the upper two-thirds still looked unreal.</p><p>This was the real fragment of the prison-guarding stele. There was no mistake.</p><p>“Collect!”</p><p>With a single thought, the prison-suppressing stele turned into a ray of light and sank into Lu Ming’s spine.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
