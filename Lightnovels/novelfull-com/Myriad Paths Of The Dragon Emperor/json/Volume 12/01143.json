Xie nianqing shouted. Black Lotus flowers appeared around her. The petals formed a Black Lotus sword in the sky and attacked The Fiend clan.</p><p>Each of the Lotus swords was terrifyingly powerful. With intent lingering around them, they cut through the sky and directly cut open a hideous hole in the space.</p><p>The Fiend clan members could only divert their attention to block the Lotus swords, and their combat strength was once again affected.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed over and killed another Mosha clan member in less than two moves.</p><p>not good! The cooperation between these two is too terrifying!</p><p>Some of the mo Sha clansmen cried out in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing’s cooperation was terrifyingly powerful. It was not as simple as one plus one equals two. Their combat strength had increased by several times.</p><p>The devil clan retreated.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? Let’s attack together!”</p><p>At this moment, an ear-piercing sound was heard. Not far away, a terrifying sharp light flew over, emitting a powerful aura.</p><p>Seventh level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This was a seventh level spiritual God Realm demon.</p><p>When they discovered that a seventh level spiritual God Realm fiend had appeared, the other fiend clan’s confidence increased greatly.</p><p>The seventh level of the spiritual God Realm was much more powerful than the sixth level.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Mosha clan tried their best to break through the force field and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The seventh level spiritual God Realm fiend immediately charged at Xie nianqing.</p><p>He could already tell that Xie nianqing had too much influence in the group battle. It would be much easier to deal with Lu Ming after dealing with Xie nianqing.</p><p>??…</p><p>The seventh level spiritual God Realm Mosha clansmen charged into the heavenly demonic force field, emitting a demonic shriek as they collided with the force field, bringing with them a series of flames.</p><p>However, he still broke through the force field and charged towards Xie nianqing.</p><p>Xie nianqing waved his hands and the Black Lotus sword flew towards his opponent, but it was also deflected by his opponent’s bone spurs.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s figure moved and appeared in front of the seventh level spiritual God Realm Mosha Clansman. He slashed out with his blood-red combat sword and collided with the other party’s bone spur.</p><p>With a ding, Lu Ming and the other party retreated at the same time.</p><p>The Mosha Clansman was taken aback. He did not expect Lu Ming to be so powerful. He was only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm, but he could actually force him to retreat.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘bloodline appeared above Lu Ming’s head. Lu Ming combined his bloodline and transformed into Nine Dragons. The nine Dragons roared and their devouring power burst forth. Together with Xie nianqing’s force field, they enveloped the Mosha.</p><p>At the same time, he used the nine Dragons step and charged toward the devil clan.</p><p>On the other side, Xie nianqing also used bloodline fusion and turned into a magnificent otherworldly demon. His demonic power was vast, and his force field was even stronger. He pressed down with his Jade-like hand, and a black jade-like palm print pressed toward The Fiend.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Facing the joint attack of the two, the seventh level spiritual God Realm Mosha clan was forced to retreat and spit out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“Prison guard, kill!”</p><p>With the nine Dragons steps, every inch of his body was able to unleash the strangle hell heaven technique. The Dragon claws swiped down and the dragon tail swept down. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming had once comprehended a true dragon combat technique from the myriad elephant Jade wall of the Tianxia Academy. When they worked together, they were even more powerful.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Blood kept spurting out of the mouth of the devil Clansman. His last wing was torn off by the nine Dragons ‘claws.</p><p>Then, the sky demon that Xie nianqing had turned into slammed his palm on the chest of The Fiend, almost splitting him into pieces. Although he didn’t die, he was half-dead.</p><p>“No, no!”</p><p>run! the devil Clansman roared and wanted to escape. At this moment, he was extremely frightened.</p><p>He had never expected that two ants at the third level of the spiritual God Realm would be so powerful. The two of them had joined forces and actually beat him, a seventh level spiritual God Realm existence, to the point where he had no power to fight back.</p><p>However, it was too late for him to escape now.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘dragon claws swiped down and smashed into the head of the devil Clansman, piercing through his head. A seventh level spiritual God Realm martial artist died!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The hearts of the remaining Mo Sha clansmen almost stopped beating.</p><p>This was too terrifying. An expert in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm had died just like that. It had only been a few moves!</p><p>“All of you, stay!”</p><p>The nine Dragons roared, and the devouring power spread rapidly, engulfing the rest of the devil clan.</p><p>At the same time, Xie nianqing’s demonic force field expanded and enveloped all the demons.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>With the nine Dragons steps, he instantly appeared in front of one of the Mosha clansmen. With a swipe of his claws, he killed the man.</p><p>The sky demon that Xie nianqing had transformed into also stepped forward and slapped down with her Jade-like palm. One of The Fiend clan members was torn apart.</p><p>With the two of them working together, killing a sixth level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha was as easy as chopping vegetables.</p><p>No matter how much The Fiend demons roared, it was useless. They were all killed.</p><p>In less than a minute, the remaining demons were all killed, and their blood essence and energy were all devoured by the nine Dragons.</p><p>At that moment, the nine Dragons shrunk rapidly and turned back into Lu Ming. Xie nianqing also kept his Blood Meridian.</p><p>The two of them stood in the air and looked at each other.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with longing for each other.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed. After the battle, Xie nianqing was finally sure that everything was real and not a dream. Lu Ming had really come to the abyss demon territory and she had really seen him.</p><p>At the same time, the two of them walked toward each other. They were very close to each other, and they stared at each other.</p><p>Xie nianqing couldn’t hold back the tears in his eyes anymore. They flowed down his cheeks.</p><p>“Little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and wiped away the tears on Xie nianqing’s face.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re finally here!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pounced into Lu Ming’s arms. Lu Ming hugged Xie nianqing tightly as if he wanted to pull Xie nianqing into his body and never separate.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s leave this place first!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>A great battle had just taken place here, so who knew when the devil clan would come again?</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and randomly chose a direction to fly in.</p><p>After traveling more than a hundred thousand miles, Lu Ming found a hidden place and the two of them entered the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“An estate-world treasure?”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his eyes.</p><p>“Okay, little Qing, you should heal first!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked in concern. Xie nianqing’s shoulder had been stabbed just now and it was not a light injury.</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded, sat down cross-legged and began to heal. Half a day later, Xie nianqing’s injuries were completely healed.</p><p>On a mountain peak in the mountain and river diagram, the two of them sat side by side. Xie nianqing’s head was on Lu Ming’s shoulder as they chatted about their experiences during this period of time.</p><p>The two of them had not seen each other for more than three years and had too many things to say.</p><p>Lu Ming told him about his experiences over the past few years. Xie nianqing’s heart was in turmoil. Every time he heard that Lu Ming was in danger, Xie nianqing would exclaim softly and worry for Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing had completely turned into a little woman. She leaned on Lu Ming’s shoulder and hugged his arm. She would not talk back to Lu Ming, but she would also shout and want to step on him. She just wanted to listen to Lu Ming quietly. That was enough.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
