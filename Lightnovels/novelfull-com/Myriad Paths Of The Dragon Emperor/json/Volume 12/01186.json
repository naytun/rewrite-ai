There are many experts here, so why are you here today? Lu Ming, do you want to go and take a look?”</p><p>...</p><p>Xie Luan looked at Lu Ming and asked.</p><p>“Good! Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming was also very curious about the sudden arrival of the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>“The two of you stay here and guard the place just in case. Lu Ming and I will go and take a look!”</p><p>Xie Lun instructed qu Luo and the Barbarian Emperor, and the two of them nodded.</p><p>“Xiao Qing, big brother Yan, wait for me here. I’ll be back with senior Xie!”</p><p>Lu Ming said to Xie nianqing and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you have to be careful!”</p><p>Xie nianqing warned.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! Xie Luan shouted. The demonic light wrapped around Lu Ming, and he stepped into the air and flew out, following the warship from the divine Ruins far behind.</p><p>The warship from the continent of Divine Ruins kept flying south at a very fast speed, and soon, it flew out of Northern Plains ‘territory and arrived at central continent, flying towards the center of central continent.</p><p>the people from the continent of the divine Ruins seem to be flying towards the place where the imperial family and the heaven suppressing divine Army are fighting.</p><p>Xie Luan softly said.</p><p>“Could it be that one of the two sides invited a helper?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed slightly. If that was the case, the situation in the divine wilderness continent would change drastically.</p><p>The warship broke through the space and flew extremely fast, quickly approaching the central continent.</p><p>“There’s a huge battle ahead!”</p><p>Xie Luan said as he gazed into the distance.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave as he sensed a terrifying pressure coming from the south. He sensed that there was a slight fluctuation in the space.</p><p>There was definitely a terrifying battle going on, because it could be determined that the battle was still very far away from here.</p><p>The warship from the continent of the divine Ruins suddenly stopped here, and the black-robed middle-aged man standing at the front of the warship looked into the distance. He then stepped out and headed south.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xie Luan and Lu Ming went around the warship and headed south as well.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, he heard a terrifying fluctuation in the sky far away. Lu Ming could vaguely see two figures fighting in the sky.</p><p>The strength of his aura had actually surpassed that of an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed. The two people fighting had extremely terrifying combat strength. They were above the Barbarian Emperor and quluo. Although they were not as terrifying as the battle between Xie ran and Di Yi, they were not much worse. They should be on the same level as Xie ran and Di Yi.</p><p>Below the battle was a huge Lake. On both sides of the lake, there were many experts.</p><p>The Earth’s core Lake was the place where the imperial family and the heaven suppressing divine Army fought.</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man from the divine Ruins continent appeared not far away. He looked at the battle ahead and did not participate for the time being.</p><p>“Xie Sheng, you’re already so old. You’re no match for me!”</p><p>In the middle of the battle, a voice rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He had heard from Xie nianqing that the previous Sacred Emperor was called Xie Sheng, and he was the grandfather of the current Sacred Emperor, Xie Qitian. He had stepped down from his position six thousand years ago and focused on his cultivation.</p><p>The outside world thought that after so many years, Xie Sheng had already passed away. However, there were also people who said that Xie Sheng was still alive. However, there had never been any proof. Now, it was proven that Xie Sheng was indeed still alive.</p><p>the other side is the battle Martial Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he looked into the distance.</p><p>The man who was fighting with Xie Sheng was a peerless expert of the heaven suppressing divine Army, the hundred battle Martial Emperor, the one who had won every battle.</p><p>Both of them were the leaders of their respective forces. Their cultivations had already entered the second level of the martial Royal realm, and they were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>whether I’m a match for you or not, we can’t say for sure until we fight to the end. Baizhan, I advise you to hand over the Heavenly King token. This is the inheritance of my imperial family. It’s not something you can take!</p><p>Said Xie Sheng. His voice was ancient, but it was like thunder, rumbling through heaven and earth, traveling an unknown distance.</p><p>“Xie Sheng, you’re already so old. Don’t think about the Heavenly King’s order anymore!”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor laughed heartily, and the battle between the two became even more intense.</p><p>In the horizon, when the black-robed middle-aged man in the divine Ruins continent heard the three words ‘Heavenly King token’, he raised his eyebrows and muttered, ” I didn’t expect the divine wilderness continent’s Heavenly King token to still be here. This trip was not in vain!</p><p>With that, he flicked his sleeves and took a step forward, rapidly approaching the battlefield between Xie Sheng and the baizhan Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>As soon as the black-robed middle-aged man approached, Xie Sheng and the baizhan Martial Emperor sensed it. They shouted and separated from each other, staring at the black-robed middle-aged man with a serious look.</p><p>They only noticed the black-robed middle-aged man when he was so close to them. This caused them to be shocked.</p><p>They scanned the black-clothed middle-aged man with their spiritual sense and realized that they could not see through his strength. They were even more shocked.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Seeing this, Lu Ming and Xie Luan were a little surprised. It seemed that the people from the divine Ruins continent were not the help of the imperial family or Xie Luan. Otherwise, Xie Sheng and the baizhan Martial Emperor would not be so surprised.</p><p>“You have the Heavenly King’s order?”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man looked at the battle Martial Emperor.</p><p>“Who are you, Sir?”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor frowned and asked.</p><p>I’m not answering your question. Let me ask you again. Do you have the Heavenly King’s order? ”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man’s voice turned cold. There was a hint of impatience in his tone, and it sounded like he was giving orders.</p><p>His words made the baizhan Martial Emperor’s face turn ugly.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, no one dared to speak to him in such a tone.</p><p>“So what if I have the Heavenly King’s token?”</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor said.</p><p>“Oh? It’s good that it’s on you. Hand it over, give me the Heavenly King’s token!”</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor laughed and said, ” you’re really funny. You appeared out of nowhere and asked me to hand over the Heavenly King token. You’re too confident. I wonder if you have the ability to be confident!</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor’s eyes flickered with a cold light.</p><p>“So you’re saying that you’re not handing it over? Then I’ll take it personally!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man took a step forward as soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With this step, the sky and the earth shook violently.</p><p>Below him, the core Lake created thousands of waves.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>An indifferent voice came out of the black-robed middle-aged man’s mouth. He struck out with his palm, and endless spiritual Qi gathered in the sky. A towering ancient tree, as tall as the sky, pressed down on the baizhan Martial Emperor.</p><p>As soon as this move was used, the battle Martial Emperor’s expression changed drastically, and his face became extremely grave.</p><p>“Hundred-Battle God fist!”</p><p>The battle Martial Emperor punched out 100 times in an instant. Each punch contained a monstrous combat power that could penetrate the earth and destroy mountains and rivers.</p><p>100 fist forces gathered in the air and merged into one fist force. Its power increased by 100 times.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force hit the ancient tree, making a world-destroying sound.</p><p>“Press!”</p><p>The black-robed middle-aged man spat out another word. He pressed his palm down and the branches of the ancient tree stretched out. Green light shot into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Baizhan Martial Emperor’s fist force collapsed instantly, and the towering ancient tree continued to press down on him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
