They just needed to hold on a little longer and they might be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could only reach this far.</p><p>The two of them sighed and decided to leave the platform and admit defeat.</p><p>At this moment, a burly figure suddenly appeared in front of them. He threw out a punch and collided with the three-headed hell hound’s claw, blocking it.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>The eyes of the two girls lit up.</p><p>The person who blocked their way was Lu Ming.</p><p>Back in the ancient herb garden, goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling had helped him once to prevent him from falling into cold-blood Hall’s trap. Now that he saw the two women in danger, he naturally would not sit by and do nothing.</p><p>it’s you. If you want to be the hero and save the beauty, then I’ll send you down!</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound roared loudly and the terrifying Hellfire burst forth, causing Lu Ming’s spiritual God to tremble slightly as if his soul was about to be frozen.</p><p>“What a powerful hell flame!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked but he laughed out loud. haha, you’re even more powerful than that Lion. I originally wanted to take that Lion as my Mount, but he wouldn’t agree to it no matter what. Although you’re a little ugly, you’re barely qualified to be my Mount!</p><p>As he laughed, his true Yuan exploded and he threw a few punches forward, exchanging a few blows with the Cerberus.</p><p>“Big beard, why did you snatch my prey?”</p><p>The heartless monk appeared not far away and said with a smile.</p><p>“Monk, I’ll finish off your prey for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Haha, that’s good. I don’t have to do it!”</p><p>The monk chuckled and turned his eyes to Dark Child.</p><p>“Sister moonless, how about I help you?”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk’s large sleeves fluttered as he arrived at the place where The Dark Child and the female Bodhisattva were fighting.</p><p>The name of the female Bodhisattva was moonless.</p><p>Dark Child looked at the unscrupulous monk with some fear.</p><p>“Heartless, go do what you need to do, I don’t need your help!”</p><p>Moonless’s face was a bit cold, and it seemed that her relationship with the unscrupulous monk was very bad.</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming almost fell down. This unscrupulous monk’s name was actually unscrupulous. It was too appropriate.</p><p>“I have rice hair, the falling flowers are interested, but the flowing water is heartless. Sister moonless doesn’t need my help, then forget it!”</p><p>The unscrupulous monk muttered. Then, his eyes started to look around again.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The onlookers were all speechless. Was this really a holy monk from the Western Desert? Why are you so unreliable?</p><p>Even some of the sovereigns in the stands had strange expressions.</p><p>The Buddha of Western Desert had a solemn expression and a smile on his face. His eyes were closed, as if he had not seen anything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming and the three-headed Hellhound were already engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound was very strong. It had already reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm and its combat strength was stronger than even Shi DU’s. At this moment, the three-headed Hellhound had unleashed its full power, causing its divine beast bloodline to boil. Lu Ming did not unleash his bloodline and was at a slight disadvantage for the time being.</p><p>it seems like it’s impossible to obtain third place without using my bloodline today!</p><p>At this thought, a drop of blood appeared on top of Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>“Borrowing power!”</p><p>Hu!</p><p>A wisp of energy from the third Blood Meridian gushed into Lu Ming’s body. His aura rose sharply, his hair turned blood-red in an instant, and his body emitted a blood-red light.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s third Blood Meridian power surged in and a terrifying killing intent erupted from his body. He struck out with his palm, aiming for one of the three-headed Hellhound’s heads.</p><p>The Cerberus’s heads spewed out terrifying attacks, but they were dispersed by Lu Ming’s palm. His palm landed heavily on one of the Cerberus ‘heads. With a loud bang, the Cerberus cried out in pain and retreated rapidly. Its head was almost shattered by Lu Ming’s chop. A part of its forehead had caved in and blood was flowing out.</p><p>“Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>“He’s Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>At this time, a few extremely shocked cries sounded out from the crowd.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi, Wu chengkong, and a few others who had seen Lu Ming in the secret realm of the Saint mansion all exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>“What? He’s Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>“Minglu is Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>“This awesome commander is Lu Shaoqing?”</p><p>Cries of alarm rang out.</p><p>Now, Lu Shaoqing’s name had already shaken the world.</p><p>News of Lu Shaoqing killing the top talents of the last generation in the secret realm of the Saint mansion of the Tianxia Academy, killing the top talents of the cold-blood Hall and the tianwu sword sect, and fighting with yang potian and the others had long spread throughout the central continent.</p><p>Everyone had long regarded Lu Shaoqing as a Big Shot. They had thought that since Lu Shaoqing had not come to the holy city, could this overpowered commander with a full beard be Lu Shaoqing?</p><p>he’s Lu Shaoqing. I can’t be wrong about this cultivation technique!</p><p>Wu chengkong and Xue Luo Zi spoke with great certainty.</p><p>“He is indeed Lu Shaoqing!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Jing kongling’s eyes flickered as they muttered to themselves.</p><p>“Hahaha, it’s really uncomfortable to have this broken beard stuck on my face!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming laughed out loud. He grabbed the fake beard on his face and threw it away.</p><p>By doing so, he would be acknowledging his identity as Lu Shaoqing.</p><p>The crowd was shocked. Minglu was indeed Lu Shaoqing, but how did he get into the law enforcement Army?</p><p>what a brilliant aura-changing technique! Even we were fooled!</p><p>An Emperor said.</p><p>None of the emperors present had noticed this earlier.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound roared loudly. All three heads opened their mouths and launched a terrifying attack.</p><p>One head spewed out black liquid, one head spewed out black flames, and the last head spewed out Black Lightning. Each of these attacks was extremely terrifying and could kill a second-grade heaven’s favorite.</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fist in the air. His third Blood Meridian squirmed and transformed into a blood-red spear that Lu Ming held.</p><p>Lu Ming cast the five killing moves and swung his spear three times in a row.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three blood-red spear shadows shattered the void and dispersed the three-headed hell hound’s attack.</p><p>Then, the long spear turned into a blood-red lightning, piercing through the layers of space, and stabbed towards one of the heads.</p><p>That head was the one that was injured by Lu Ming earlier.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The spear directly pierced through the hole in the ground, penetrating the Cerberus’s head.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>The other two heads of the three-headed Hellhound let out a frenzied roar and launched a terrifying attack at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s left palm struck out continuously, activating the prison-suppressing heavenly art to counter the Cerberus ‘attacks.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the three-headed Hellhound retreated rapidly. The head that Lu Ming had pierced through was shrouded in black mist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
