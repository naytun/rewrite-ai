There were countless forbidden places and too many powerful existences. It was extremely dangerous for a Martial Emperor to walk in the yuan continent. He could die at any time.</p><p>Legend had it that in the history of the divine wilderness continent, there were also martial emperors who sought out the yuan continent in order to break through. They wanted to cultivate there, but they all died.</p><p>To cultivate in peace in the yuan continent, one had to join a major power and seek protection.</p><p>However, the conditions for recruiting disciples were too harsh. Ordinary emperors were not worthy of their attention. Only special conditions could allow them to join.</p><p>The heaven seat King was one of the major powers in the yuan continent.</p><p>The Heavenly King token was a kind of token issued by the heaven King Hall. As long as one held the Heavenly King token, even if one’s talent was slightly weaker, one could still join the heaven King Hall and cultivate there.</p><p>According to Xie Luan, the Heavenly King’s token had originally belonged to the Imperial Xie clan.</p><p>The Royal Xie family was able to prosper for a long time because they had the Heavenly King token. Every generation of emperors had joined the Heavenly King Hall, so they were able to dominate the divine wilderness continent for a million years.</p><p>However, the Heavenly King token was stolen by Xie Luan thirty thousand years ago.</p><p>With the token of the Heavenly King, one could join the Heavenly King Hall, a major power in the yuan continent. To an Emperor, what kind of temptation was this?</p><p>When one reached the Emperor realm, their goal was to continue breaking through, seek a stronger realm, and gain more longevity.</p><p>Otherwise, they might not be able to break through in the divine wilderness continent for the rest of their lives. Who would be willing to watch as their time came to an end and die slowly?</p><p>Although he could rule over a region of the divine wilderness continent, all of this was just an illusion. Once the time was up, he would be reduced to dust.</p><p>For a martial artist, only their realm and strength were true.</p><p>If they had a choice, most of the sovereigns would choose to go to the yuan continent and join a big force to seek a stronger realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, if he could not join a major power and headed to the yuan continent, the probability of him dying was too high.</p><p>Hence, the divine wilderness continent’s emperors remained on the divine Wilderness Road. If not, they would have gone to the yuan continent to cultivate.</p><p>The Heavenly King token was an opportunity, and it was a fatal temptation for emperors.</p><p>Previously, when Lu Ming heard all this, he was also shocked.</p><p>The ocean was much more interesting and mysterious than he had imagined.</p><p>If there was a chance, Lu Ming would definitely go overseas and visit Yuan Lu.</p><p>Xie Luan, the Heavenly King’s token originally belonged to the Royal Xie family. Now, quickly give me the Heavenly King’s token!</p><p>Xie Qitian’s heart could no longer calm down. He stared at the Heavenly King token fervently and shouted.</p><p>Xie Qitian, your Xie family has controlled the Heavenly King token for a million years. Now, it’s time for other forces to control it. Xie Luan, give me the Heavenly King token and I’ll do my best to keep you safe!</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor also shouted.</p><p>“Leave it to me, I’m willing to form an alliance with you!”</p><p>The Thunder saber Emperor also shouted.</p><p>They were too tempted and completely lost their sense of propriety.</p><p>If they could obtain the Heavenly King token, they would immediately leave the divine wilderness continent and head overseas to search for the yuan continent and join the heaven seat King to cultivate. As for their disciples, how could they compare their future to their own?</p><p>No matter how strong the royal family and the Xie family were, they could just leave without a word.</p><p>you want the Heavenly King token of my Xie family? you should be destroyed!</p><p>Xie Qitian shouted, and together with the two emperors of the imperial family, they charged towards Xie Luan.</p><p>A smile appeared at the corner of Xie Luan’s mouth, and then he suddenly threw the Heavenly King token at sword Emperor wujue.</p><p>“The Heavenly King’s token, here you go!”</p><p>Xie Luan shrieked. His demonic Qi swept up Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, pulling them to the side.</p><p>“The Heavenly King’s token is mine!”</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor was ecstatic. She reached out her hand and grabbed the Heavenly King token.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it, it’s mine!”</p><p>On the side, the Thunder saber Emperor revealed a greedy light. A bright Saber Light wrapped in thousands of Thunderbolts slashed toward the wujue sword Emperor.</p><p>“Thunder, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The wujue sword Emperor was furious, and a vast sword light burst out, slashing toward the Thunder saber Emperor.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The sword radiance and the lightning and thunder saber radiance collided, and the sky was filled with sword Qi and saber energy. The space was torn apart like a spider web, covering the entire sky.</p><p>A few streaks of sword Qi and saber Qi seeped out and slashed the ground below. The ground was directly split open, and a few huge ravines that were more than ten thousand Li Long appeared. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, the sacred city glowed, and a light shield rose up, blocking the force outside.</p><p>Otherwise, the entire holy city would not be able to withstand a few rounds of turmoil.</p><p>“Hand over the Heavenly King’s token!”</p><p>Xie Qitian and the two emperors from the royal family pounced on sword Emperor wujue and launched their strongest attacks.</p><p>Holy light filled the world. In the sky, it was as if several White Suns had appeared. The entire holy city was covered in milky-white holy light, so blinding that one could not open their eyes.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>There seemed to be a magnitude 10 earthquake in the sky and the earth. The entire space was pierced through. Lu Ming looked into the distance and could only see a few figures fighting wildly. They fought high in the sky and then into the dark space.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A sword light accidentally spilled out and stabbed into the ground. An unfathomably deep sword hole suddenly appeared in the ground. After a while, lava actually gushed out.</p><p>The sword had pierced through the earth’s crust.</p><p>The battle between the emperors was a crazy slaughter. The scene was too shocking.</p><p>In the holy city, countless people looked on in a daze, stunned by such a terrifying scene.</p><p>If not for the holy city having an incomparably powerful array protecting it, they would not dare to stand here at all. Once they were affected by the aftershock, it would be a dead end.</p><p>Everything that happened today was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The protagonists of today’s events were not involved, but Xie Qitian and the other emperors had an intense battle.</p><p>let’s go. They don’t have time to care about anything else. Let’s go to the chaotic domain and find the backup I left behind. When I really recover my Emperor cultivation, I won’t have to be afraid of them anymore!</p><p>Xie Luan said. Then, he brought Lu Ming and Xie nianqing with him, tore open space, and disappeared from the place.</p><p>……</p><p>Three days later, a piece of news spread across the entire central continent and even the four territories.</p><p>Three days ago, Lu Ming had gone to the holy city and was the first to display his terrifying combat strength.</p><p>Later, the rumored fallen divine warrior of chaotic heavens, Xie Luan, was reborn. He was rescued by Lu Ming from the abyss Demon Realm, which led to the royal family’s pursuit.</p><p>In the sacred city, Xie Luan took out the Heavenly King’s token, which caused an intense fight between the emperors.</p><p>That battle was so intense that the heavens and earth cracked, the sun and moon dimmed, and it was extremely tragic.</p><p>In the end, the wujue sword Emperor was killed by the royal family in that battle, the Thunder saber Emperor fled with serious injuries, and the Heavenly King token fell into the hands of the Royal Xie family.</p><p>As soon as the news spread, many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>When Xie Luan was born, the emperors fought each other, and one of them died because of this.</p><p>It had been many years since an Emperor had fallen in battle. But now, there was one.</p><p>All of this was because of one young man, Lu Ming!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
