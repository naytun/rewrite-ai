Why are you still not surrendering? ”</p><p>...</p><p>Quluo stood high in the sky and looked down. His voice spread throughout the mountain piercing sect, and the vast Emperor’s pressure covered the mountain piercing sect, making it hard for people to breathe.</p><p>“I surrender! I’m willing to surrender!”</p><p>“I also surrender!”</p><p>After the Emperor was killed, many disciples and powerhouses of the mountain piercing sect finally lost the courage to fight and surrendered.</p><p>“You traitors, have you forgotten the emperor’s kindness to you?”</p><p>There were also people who were more unyielding and would rather die than surrender, so they were naturally killed on the spot.</p><p>This was war, and no one would be soft-hearted.</p><p>Seeing this, more people from the mountain piercing sect surrendered.</p><p>Next, they tidied up the battlefield and made arrangements for the aftermath. Lu Ming did not participate. He sat cross-legged on the warship and focused on refining the concept runes and energy to break through to the next realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Not long after, a powerful aura burst out from Lu Ming’s body and soared into the sky, attracting many gazes.</p><p>“You’ve broken through?”</p><p>Quluo, Mo Ye, and the other powerhouses looked at Lu Ming with shock in their eyes.</p><p>He had only wandered around the battlefield once, and his cultivation had actually broken through.</p><p>Furthermore, he had actually broken through to the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm at such a young age. This was truly shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming’s aura burst out but he retracted it in the next moment. However, he did not end his cultivation. Instead, he continued to refine the concept runes that he had devoured.</p><p>He had devoured the intent runes of dozens of experts. They were at least at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm and above. His comprehension of the heaven and earth intent realm was very profound. Lu Ming would have to put in a lot of effort to refine them.</p><p>Half an hour later, the battlefield had been tidied up, and the Army had gathered, ready to fight the next force, the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Speed was of paramount importance in war, so they had to set off immediately.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming had finished his refinement. He stood up and went to the front of the Army.</p><p>“Let’s go to the hundred beasts tribe!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave the order.</p><p>The Army once again boarded the warships, and they set off for the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>As for those from the mountain piercing sect who had surrendered, they had all been engraved with formations in their sea of consciousness. They would follow them to fight against the hundred beasts tribe, leaving only a few people behind to guard the main headquarters of the mountain piercing sect.</p><p>The warship broke through the air and flew toward the hundred beasts tribe at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in one of the rooms on the warship and continued to refine the concept runes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.</p><p>The warship was already approaching the hundred beasts tribe. At this moment, Lu Ming had finally refined all the intent runes that he had devoured.</p><p>the wind, fire, Thunder, and water concepts have all reached the upper tier of level four. The earth concept has also reached the peak of the lower tier of level four. It’s only one step away from the upper tier of level four!</p><p>my cultivation has also increased to the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. The increase this time is really huge. However, I’ve increased too quickly and am now filled with impurities. My Foundation is not stable and I can’t continue to devour and increase my cultivation in a short period of time. I need to Polish and stabilize my Foundation!</p><p>Lu Ming had a smile on his face.</p><p>At the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm, coupled with the great progress of the intent realm of heaven and earth, Lu Ming’s combat strength had also improved greatly.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and walked out of the room. He came to the deck of the warship and looked into the distance.</p><p>In front of him, tens of thousands of miles away, countless sharp towers appeared. These sharp towers were all made of stone and stood on the vast grassland like sharp spikes.</p><p>This was the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>It could be said that it was the strongest tribe in Northern Plains, an ancient tribe with a long history.</p><p>Every single Spire was glowing. The light from every Spire gathered together and formed a large formation that enveloped the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Countless figures appeared in the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Some rode on war beasts and floated in the air, while others stood on the ground and formed battle formations.</p><p>Regardless of whether they were male or female, they were all very strong, burly, and full of Valiance.</p><p>It was obvious that the hundred beasts tribe had already received the news of the battle at the mountain piercing sect and had made preparations in advance.</p><p>The warship stopped. Lu Ming and the rest flew out of the warship and stopped in front of the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Two terrifying auras burst forth. Qu Luo and Mo Ye stepped out, and their Emperor’s might spread out towards the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>At this time, an aura also rose up from the hundred beasts tribe. A burly middle-aged man stepped out and floated in the air. His body exuded a shocking aura.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was an Emperor, the leader of the hundred beasts tribe, the Barbarian Emperor!</p><p>qu Luo, it’s really you, but I don’t think you have such a big appetite. First, you destroyed the mountain-piercing sect, and now, you’ve come to my hundred beasts tribe. It seems that you’re a man of the chaotic heavens divine warrior!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor said.</p><p>Earlier, Xie Luan had also led his Army to attack the other forces. It was obvious that the Barbarian Emperor already knew of their origins.</p><p>“Barbarian Emperor, since you already know, I advise you to surrender. Otherwise, you will end up like the mountain piercing sect!”</p><p>Qu Luo said coldly.</p><p>haha, the hundred beasts tribe has existed for countless years. We have never surrendered before a battle. If you want to attack us, then let’s fight!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor laughed, his voice incomparably domineering.</p><p>With that, a glistening yellow staff appeared above the Barbarian Emperor’s head. It floated above the Barbarian Emperor’s head and grew rapidly, emitting shocking fluctuations.</p><p>“Emperor spiritual weapon, you also have an Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Qu Luo and Mo Ye exclaimed at the same time, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Back in the Saint mansion’s Secret realm, there were a total of four King spiritual weapons.</p><p>He had obtained one, while yang potian, Tuoba Shi, and Wuliang monk had each obtained one.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze around and indeed, he saw Tuoba Shi in front of the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Tuoba Shi came from the hundred beasts tribe, so he must have obtained this Emperor spiritual weapon from the secret realm of the Saint mansion.</p><p>let’s fight. Even if the hundred beasts tribe is defeated, you won’t have an easy time!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s eyes revealed a malevolent expression.</p><p>Qu Luo and Mo Ye’s expressions were grave.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s combat strength was already very strong, even slightly stronger than quluo’s. With the addition of the Emperor spiritual weapon, his combat strength was even stronger. Even if the two of them joined forces, they might not be able to win.</p><p>Even with the addition of Yan kuangtu, whose combat strength had barely reached the Emperor realm, it was still hard to say. Even if they could win, if the Barbarian Emperor risked his life, it was not impossible for him to drag them down with him.</p><p>Even if they could win this battle, it would be a Pyrrhic victory.</p><p>However, at this point, he had no choice but to fight.</p><p>“Barbarian Emperor, since you’re so stubborn, we can only fight and destroy your hundred beasts tribe!”</p><p>Qu Luo spoke and stepped forward, his fighting intent even stronger.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly spoke.</p><p>Qu Luo frowned and glanced at Lu Ming, a hint of displeasure in his eyes. But at the thought of Xie Luan’s words, he held back and stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped out and came to the front.</p><p>Most of the people from the hundred beasts tribe were looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>They were secretly surprised. They did not know Lu Ming’s background. He could actually make an Emperor listen to his orders.</p><p>A ‘wait a minute’ was heard, stopping one of the emperors.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s him!”</p><p>In the hundred beasts tribe, Tuoba Shi recognized Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
