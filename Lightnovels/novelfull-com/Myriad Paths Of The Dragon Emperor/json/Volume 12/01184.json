He soared into the sky and punched at the giant hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>There was a shocking boom, and then the Barbarian Emperor’s body trembled. He was actually no match for the Barbarian Emperor and was blasted down.</p><p>The huge hand did not stop and continued to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>Enveloped by this huge hand, Lu Ming felt as if the space around him had been locked down. Lu Ming’s body was pressed down by endless gravity, making it difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Di Yi!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He was very familiar with the aura of this big hand. It was Di Yi, a Martial Emperor.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that Martial Emperor Di Yi would make a move at this time.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had thought that Di Yi might take action. However, the demon God Valley had a sovereign. Lu Ming thought that Di Yi would be afraid.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Eight streams of dragon energy burst forth in Lu Ming’s body. At the same time, his third bloodline emerged, and a powerful force surged into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>“Break, break!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart and exploded with all his strength, trying to break open the surrounding space. However, the surrounding space was extremely firm. With Lu Ming’s current strength, he could not even move an inch.</p><p>“Who is it? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>A long roar was heard. From another direction in the demon God Valley, a demonic light shot up and a vast demonic blade slashed at the giant hand.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After the Barbarian Emperor’s punch and the saber, the huge hand finally collapsed and disappeared.</p><p>The pressure on Lu Ming’s body was also lifted. Lu Ming’s body felt lighter and he regained his freedom.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>With a flash of demonic light, quluo appeared beside Lu Ming. The Barbarian Emperor also came to Lu Ming’s side. An iron rod floated above the Barbarian Emperor’s head, emanating a terrifying aura. It was an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>The two of them looked at the sky with a grave expression.</p><p>A golden light flashed in the sky, and a figure stepped out of the spatial crack.</p><p>It was Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>“Di Yi of the East barren, what do you want to do by coming to the demon God Valley? Do you want to start a war with us?”</p><p>Qu Luo coldly shouted.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, there were only so many emperors, so they naturally knew each other.</p><p>“I’m only here to take Lu Ming away. This has nothing to do with you!”</p><p>Di Yi’s entire body bloomed with golden light. He stood high in the sky, like a high and mighty Emperor, looking down on the common people.</p><p>“Take away general Lu? What a joke. Di Yi, not only can you not take anyone away today, but you can’t even leave!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s eyes flickered with a malevolent light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, from all over the demon God Valley, there were sounds of people flying through the air. The commotion just now had alarmed the entire Demon God Valley.</p><p>“Stop! Don’t come over!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was heard and everyone stopped in their tracks.</p><p>When the Emperor took action, the others could not help at all.</p><p>Two people did not stop and directly flew over. They were Xie nianqing and Yan kuangtu.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing held Lu Ming’s hand and looked at Di Yi in the sky, looking worried.</p><p>“Di Yi!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu licked his lips. The Emperor spirit tower floated above his head, revealing a powerful fighting spirit.</p><p>“If you don’t hand it over, I’ll personally take it!”</p><p>Di Yi’s cold voice rang out. He clenched his fist in the air and a golden combat sword appeared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The Golden combat sword emitted an infinite amount of golden light. The sword light was as large as a mountain, and a vast pressure bloomed. It slashed down violently towards the Barbarian Emperor and the others.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor shouted and rose to the sky, holding the iron rod in his hand. The iron rod grew rapidly, turning into a giant rod tens of thousands of meters long, and swept toward Di Yi’s sword light.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic Qi on qu Luo’s body soared to the sky, and he slashed out a huge Saber Light toward the sword light.</p><p>Above Yan kuangtu’s head, the Emperor spirit tower expanded rapidly and crashed toward the sword radiance in the sky.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Three terrifying explosions sounded in succession.</p><p>First, it was the Barbarian Emperor. He held a huge rod and smashed it against the sword light. His whole body trembled as if he was facing an undefeatable force. His body fell down like a cannonball.</p><p>Then, qu Luo’s demonic blade was crushed by the sword radiance and finally collided with Yan kuangtu’s Emperor spirit tower.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor, qu Luo, and Yan kuangtu were sent flying one after another. They staggered in the sky and retreated hundreds of miles, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s condition was the most serious. His face was pale and bloodless.</p><p>In one move, Di Yi had injured two emperors and Yan kuangtu. He had displayed his terrifying combat power.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Qu Luo shouted in disbelief.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor and Yan kuangtu were both shocked.</p><p>The three of them had to work together to block Di Yi’s sword, but they were all injured. It was unbelievable.</p><p>They had all dealt with Di Yi before, but they had never expected that Di Yi’s combat power would be so strong.</p><p>“No one can stop me from taking Lu Ming away!”</p><p>Di Yi said coldly. He stretched out his hand and a big golden hand formed out of thin air. It exuded a vast pressure and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu, the Barbarian Emperor, and qu Luo shouted loudly. They used their strongest move to stop Di Yi.</p><p>However, Di Yi took a step and three golden sword lights condensed in the air. They hit the three of them and forced them back again.</p><p>The Golden hand did not stop and continued to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the space in front of Lu Ming cracked open and a black fist radiance shot out. It collided with the Golden hand and both of them disappeared.</p><p>Then, a tall figure stepped out.</p><p>“Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>Qu Luo was overjoyed to see this person.</p><p>“Thank you, chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed.</p><p>Xie Luan stood in front of Lu Ming, looked at Di Yi, and said, ” “It’s rare to have an expert like you among the younger generation. But with me here, you can’t take Lu Ming away!”</p><p>“Chaotic sky Emperor, you have been suppressed for 30000 years and are no longer the same as before. Do you really think you can fight me?”</p><p>Di Yi spoke. Even in the face of the chaotic sky divine warrior, he was still full of confidence.</p><p>we’ll know if we can fight him or not after we try. Let’s go up and fight him!</p><p>Xie Luan took a step forward and rushed up to the sky.</p><p>Di Yi glanced at Lu Ming. He took a step forward and, together with Xie Luan, rushed into the sky.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>An extremely terrifying rumble suddenly sounded from an unknown height. A bright light flashed out like a sun exploding in the sky. It could be seen even from millions of miles away.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, terrifying rumbles rang out continuously in the sky. Rings of light lit up one after another, as if many suns had exploded at the same time. The scene was extremely shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming and the others looked up into the sky, but they could only see a dazzling light. They could not see the figures of Di Yi, Martial Emperor, and Xie Lun.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows and was secretly shocked.</p><p>The fluctuations and auras caused by the battle between Xie Luan and Di Yi were obviously much stronger than that of an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>What realm had they reached?</p><p>“My eyes!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>Some people with low cultivation looked up at the battle in the sky. Their eyes were Blinded by the Light and they didn’t dare to watch anymore.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
