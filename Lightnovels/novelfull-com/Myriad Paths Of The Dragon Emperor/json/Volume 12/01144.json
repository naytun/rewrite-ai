Like me, it’s very difficult to get ten thousand points.”</p><p>...</p><p>Then, he looked at Lu Ming affectionately and said,”Lu Ming, why are you so silly? It’s all because of me that you’re in this place!”</p><p>“You fool, if I didn’t come here to find you myself, I wouldn’t be at ease. By the way, did you come here after you came back from ninedragons?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded and said, ” when I first came back, Xie Qitian sent someone to send me to the abyss demon territory. Unfortunately, although they knew that my bloodline was inclined to darkness, they didn’t know that my bloodline was the heavenly demon bloodline. In the abyss demon territory, I was like a fish in water. My cultivation speed was faster than the outside world. Moreover, I’ve awakened the third bloodline. Using the demon Qi and demon stones, my cultivation speed was even faster!</p><p>At this point, Xie nianqing’s voice turned cold. He seemed to be filled with hatred for the Xie family.</p><p>Lu Ming tightened his grip on Xie nianqing’s arm. One could imagine that Xie nianqing had been struggling and cultivating alone in the abyss demon territory for the past few years. He had been walking on the edge of life and death. Otherwise, he would not have such a high cultivation level.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart ached.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m so happy that you’re here!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice whispered in Lu Ming’s ear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s head turned slightly. He looked at the beautiful face that was right in front of him and felt Xie nianqing’s gentle breathing. He could only feel his heart beating rapidly. This unpolished face was peerless and alluring. The faint smile that was brimming on her face seemed to be Lu Ming’s everything.</p><p>The two of them had not seen each other for a long time, so they naturally had a moment of warmth.</p><p>it’s really painful to the eyes!</p><p>After an unknown period of time, a sudden cry interrupted the two of them.</p><p>The two of them opened their eyes at the same time and saw dandan not far away, staring at them with her eyes wide open.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red. Even his ears and neck were red.</p><p>“Continue, you guys continue, don’t worry about me!”</p><p>When he saw the two of them looking at him, dandan said leisurely.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming swung his palm, and a palm print condensed from quintessential essence blasted toward dandan. Dandan was sent flying like a rock by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>“Argh! Lu Ming, you’re a guy who values your lover over your friends. No, I mean, you’re a guy who values your seniors over your friends …”</p><p>Dandan’s voice came from far away. In the end, it turned into a black dot and disappeared in the air. No one knew how far it had flown.</p><p>After dandan’s ruckus, the two’s boiling blood also calmed down.</p><p>“You … Lecherous …”</p><p>Xie nianqing tidied up his messy clothes and said with a red face.</p><p>Lu Ming chuckled and held Xie nianqing’s hand. “Little Qing, why did those Mo Sha race attack you earlier?”</p><p>“Because of a Golem!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. Then, a demon statue appeared in her hand.</p><p>The demonic statue was very small, only the size of a fist, but it exuded a terrifying demonic will. This demonic will was arrogant and overbearing, as if it wanted to destroy the heavens and dominate the world.</p><p>“What a strong demonic intent!”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked. It was only a Golem and it was already so terrifying. This Golem was definitely a valuable treasure to cultivators of the demonic path or to The Fiend clan. No wonder so many powerful people from The Fiend clan wanted to surround Xie nianqing.</p><p>“I obtained this devil statue from the devil tablet mountain!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said. Then, he put away the golem and the pressure around him disappeared.</p><p>“Little Qing, did you really enter the Devil tablet mountain? I heard that it’s very dangerous there, and everyone who entered died!”</p><p>Although he knew that Xie nianqing was fine, Lu Ming could not help but worry.</p><p>“I’ve heard that the devil tablet mountain is indeed very dangerous. In the past, many devil clan and human warriors had died. However, I don’t know why, but when I get close to this place, I feel a strong throbbing in my heart, as if I’m being summoned by something. There seems to be something on the devil tablet mountain that is attracting me. That’s why I took the risk and entered the devil tablet mountain!”</p><p>but the strange thing is that I didn’t encounter any danger when I entered the devil tablet mountain. Instead, I obtained an opportunity and had a breakthrough in my cultivation. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have my current cultivation and I would still be able to bring out this devil statue!</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“You also have this feeling? What is it that is attracting you?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming in surprise. “Don’t tell me you have one too?”</p><p>“That’s right. Ever since I got close to the devil tablet mountain, my second bloodline has been burning and restless. It’s as if something is attracting it. If I didn’t control it, it would have appeared on its own.”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. He felt that this was very unbelievable.</p><p>“Little Qing, what’s in the devil tablet mountain?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I was just walking around the outer area and didn’t go in. The devil tablet mountain was covered in fog and I couldn’t see clearly. I was planning to study this devil statue before entering the devil tablet mountain!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>Then, the two of them discussed for a while more, but they still couldn’t come to a conclusion. In the end, they decided to go and explore the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>This was because there was no danger when Xie nianqing entered.</p><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before walking out of the mountain and river diagram and looking at the devil tablet mountain in the distance.</p><p>Even though they were very far apart, Lu Ming’s prison-suppressing stele bloodline still throbbed. As for Xie nianqing, the bloodline at her spine was also emitting a faint blood-red light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
