They looked ordinary, but they exuded a terrifying aura. Lu Ming had seen that aura more than once.</p><p>...</p><p>The aura of an Emperor!</p><p>The two old men beside Xie Qitian were also emperors. With Xie Qitian, the royal family had three emperors. It was truly terrifying.</p><p>This was only on the surface. Lu Ming did not believe that there were no hidden sovereigns in the royal family. There were rumors in the world that the old Sacred Emperor of the ancient sacred dynasty might not be dead.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty was indeed an ancient power that had been around for millions of years. Even though it was weak, it had a deep foundation that was not something that any other Overlord power could compare to.</p><p>Behind Xie Qitian and the two old men, there were more than ten men and women. All of them had the looks of Dragons and phoenixes, Dragons among men.</p><p>The older ones were already middle-aged, while the youngest looked to be in his twenties.</p><p>There were a total of 15 people, and they were the children of the current Sacred Emperor, the princes and princesses of the ancient sacred dynasty.</p><p>“Thank you, nianjun!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>Among the crowd, he saw a woman who looked very similar to Xie nianqing. However, she was colder and more Holy than Xie nianqing. She was like an inviolable goddess, high and mighty, looking down on all living beings.</p><p>Beside Xie nianjun, there was a woman in her twenties. She was in her Prime and was devastatingly beautiful.</p><p>Although this woman didn’t look like Xie nianjun or Xie nianqing, she was still a rare beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This woman must be the other princess, Xie nianlin.</p><p>However, he did not see Xie nianqing.</p><p>it’s such an important day, but he didn’t let little Qing appear. He really doesn’t treat little Qing as his own child!</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists.</p><p>Other than that, he also saw Xie Zhen and the tenth Prince, Xie Yan. Lu Ming had not seen the other princes before.</p><p>After the princes and princesses, there were a few concubines, nobles and officials, as well as some powerful cultivators of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>Thousands of people stepped into the air and landed on the platform.</p><p>“The sage Emperor has descended. Guests, please take your seats!”</p><p>It was the same voice again, spreading throughout the entire sacred city. The person who transmitted the voice was definitely a Supreme-being level figure.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a loud laugh was heard.</p><p>haha, is our yin-yang Palace the first one to arrive? ”</p><p>A burly, white-haired old man wearing a robe with a yin-yang fish pattern walked in the air with a group of people.</p><p>This old man’s aura was terrifying and his might suppressed the world.</p><p>Emperor, this was another Emperor.</p><p>the Yin Yang sovereign and his disciples of the yin-yang Palace have arrived!</p><p>The voice rang out and spread throughout the sacred city.</p><p>“I wonder how many big shots will be coming today!”</p><p>Beside Lu Ming, tie Xing and the rest were so excited that their eyes were shining.</p><p>The yin-yang Palace was also an Overlord force in the central continent. It was as powerful as the heavenly Sword sect.</p><p>“Brother Yin Yang, please sit!”</p><p>Xie Qitian raised his hand.</p><p>“Thank you, brother!”</p><p>The Yin Yang sovereign cupped his fists and led the experts of the yin-yang Palace to a nearby table.</p><p>“The demon Emperor of Mount tianyao has arrived!”</p><p>Soon, another big force arrived. It was the Overlord force of the central continent, the heavenly demon mountain. Similar to the myriad demon Valley of the eastern wilderness, they were both gathering places for demonic beasts, led by a demon Emperor.</p><p>“Martial Emperor Yuexin and her disciples from the floating mountain sect have arrived!”</p><p>“Cold-blood Hall …”</p><p>“Heavenly Sun Palace …”</p><p>……</p><p>Following that, many overlords of the central continent arrived one after another. Each Overlord force was personally led by an Emperor. Soon, more than a dozen emperors appeared on both sides of the platform in the sky.</p><p>In the sacred city, countless people’s eyes lit up as they looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>The gathering of over a dozen emperors was too shocking and terrifying.</p><p>How many years would it take for this to happen? it was too rare.</p><p>Perhaps many sovereigns had gathered in the ancient city of Providence during the last battle of Providence, but that had been in the ancient city of Providence, and ordinary people wouldn’t have been able to see them. But now, there were over a dozen sovereigns in front of everyone.</p><p>As for Supreme-beings, there were even more of them. However, they were completely overshadowed by the brilliance of the Emperor.</p><p>A dozen sovereigns! What kind of power was this? if they joined forces, they could really destroy the world.</p><p>“The heaven suppressing divine Army’s hundred battle Martial Emperor has arrived!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, and the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Everyone looked in the same direction.</p><p>There was a middle-aged man in Black armor walking over. Behind him was a group of people. Every one of them was wearing armor. Their aura was wild and their fighting spirit was soaring.</p><p>Each of them was filled with an incomparably strong battle intent, as if they were ready for a great battle at any moment.</p><p>“Hiss, the people of the heaven suppressing divine Army are here!”</p><p>Some people gasped and discussed in low voices.</p><p>In the central continent, the heaven suppressing divine Army was the only force that was as powerful as the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army was the force that hated the ancient Saint dynasty the most.</p><p>The heaven suppressing divine Army used to be the strongest army of the ancient Saint dynasty. There were many powerful cultivators in it and they were invincible. Back then, they had helped the ancient Saint dynasty suppress the world and everyone was afraid of them.</p><p>It was known as ‘heaven suppression’, so one could imagine how powerful it was.</p><p>However, the heaven suppressing divine Army chose to watch the battle 30000 years ago. In the end, the Royal Xie family suffered a great loss, and the heaven suppressing divine Army announced that they would leave the Xie family and dominate the world.</p><p>Some people said that if the heaven suppressing divine Legion had joined the battle, the royal family and the Xie family would not have suffered such heavy losses. They would not have lost control of the world, and the situation in the central continent would not have become like it was now.</p><p>Therefore, the Royal Xie family regarded the heaven suppressing divine Army as a traitor and an enemy. In the past 30000 years, the two sides had had many terrible Wars. However, the strength of the two sides was almost the same, and each side had suffered losses, so neither side could do anything to the other.</p><p>Yang potian, one of the top five young warriors, was from the heaven suppressing divine Army.</p><p>Some people had guessed that the heaven suppressing divine Army wouldn’t come today, but unexpectedly, they came, and the one leading them was a famous and unparalleled Martial Emperor.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s eyes glowed as he stared at the battle Martial Emperor. “Today, we are guests. Please sit!”</p><p>“You’re welcome!”</p><p>The hundred battles Martial Emperor said in a carefree manner and led his men to a seat at the side.</p><p>“The third underworld Emperor of the southern underworld has arrived!”</p><p>“The Western Desert’s indestructible Buddha Emperor has arrived!”</p><p>Northern Plains ‘expert has arrived!</p><p>the Supreme from the eastern barren territory’s Empyrean God Palace, the heavenly corpse sect, and the sky demon Valley have arrived!</p><p>Then, announcements were made.</p><p>In the South, an Emperor of the underworld of the southern underworld was approaching with a group of experts.</p><p>In the West, there was an old monk with a benevolent smile on his face. He was wearing a simple Kasaya and his body was covered in golden light. A wheel of Buddhist light appeared above his head.</p><p>This was a Buddha, also known as the Buddha Emperor. He was an Emperor.</p><p>As for Northern Plains and Eastern barren, there were no emperors.</p><p>Because Northern Plains was the same as the eastern barren territory, there were several large forces occupying it, they fought each other and the Emperor could not leave easily, otherwise, the enemy might take advantage of the situation.</p><p>“Wang Shengtian, the patriarch of the Wang family, and the patriarch of the Jiang family!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes moved.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
