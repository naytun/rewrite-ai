The demon God Valley of Northern Plains is the backup plan I left behind. But thirty thousand years have passed, and I do not know the exact situation. I will first rush to the demon God Valley alone and take control of it!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming will be in charge of this place. Wait for my news. After I control the demon God Valley, I will activate the inter-territory teleportation formation and connect it with cold-blood Hall. Then, they will take the teleportation formation to Northern Plains!</p><p>Xie Luan explained his plan.</p><p>It was obvious that this plan was the best one at the moment, so no one raised any objections.</p><p>“Alright, since that’s the case, I’ll cut to the chase. I’ll set off immediately. Lu Ming, I’ll leave this place to you!”</p><p>Xie Luan stood up and took a step forward. As he stepped forward, space naturally split open, and Xie Luan’s figure disappeared into a spatial Rift.</p><p>After Xie Luan left, Lu Ming made arrangements for the talisman Amulet sect.</p><p>big brother Yan, please keep this Emperor spirit tower!</p><p>In front of a courtyard, Lu Ming called out to Yan kuangtu and handed him a small fiery red Pagoda.</p><p>It was the Emperor spiritual weapon he had obtained from the secret realm of the Saint mansion. It was called the Emperor spirit tower.</p><p>Previously, he had lent it to Xie Luan for the time being. After Xie Luan recovered his Emperor cultivation, he returned it to Lu Ming.</p><p>The Emperor spirit tower was a fire-attribute treasure with a fire domain. Yan kuangtu’s bloodline was that of the three-legged golden Crow. His fire power was unparalleled in the world, so it was the most suitable for Yan kuangtu to use. It would be even more powerful.</p><p>“This is … An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s face suddenly changed as he used his telegnosis ability to scan the area, ” “Lu Ming, this is too valuable. I can’t accept it!”</p><p>“Big brother Yan, do you still need to be so polite with me? Besides, the Emperor spirit tower can only unleash its greatest power in your hands now that the war is imminent. It won’t be of much use in my hands!”</p><p>Lu Ming pushed the Emperor spirit tower and it flew towards Yan kuangtu.</p><p>Seeing how determined Lu Ming was, Yan kuangtu did not decline further and kept the Emperor spirit tower.</p><p>To be honest, the Emperor spirit tower was really useful to him. The fire domain on it was helpful to his cultivation and would help him break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, thank you!”</p><p>After Yan kuangtu kept it, he cupped his fists at Lu Ming solemnly. His expression was rare to see solemnity and seriousness.</p><p>“Haha, big brother Yan, I’m not used to seeing you like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed and strode away.</p><p>After returning to his residence, Lu Ming’s glabella lit up and the figure of his second body appeared.</p><p>An array disc appeared in Lu Ming’s hands and he flew to the second body. The second body caught it and started to inscribe inscriptions and arrays with both hands.</p><p>The second body’s Dao of inscription was much stronger than two years ago. In an instant, dense inscriptions flew into the array disc.</p><p>This array disc was the one the profound sky Saint had given him in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. As long as his second body controlled the array disc, he could enter the secret realm of the Saint mansion and obtain the inheritance of the profound sky Saint.</p><p>Very soon, the array disc was glowing brightly and formed a huge vortex. He nodded slightly at Lu Ming, then stepped into it and disappeared.</p><p>After the second body disappeared, the vortex also disappeared.</p><p>Everything was ready. Lu Ming waited with peace of mind.</p><p>What was surprising was that not long after, the floating mountain sect sent two Supremes, saying that they would assist Lu Ming in his battle in Northern Plains.</p><p>Lu Ming was naturally overjoyed.</p><p>With two more Supreme martial artists, their strength was naturally stronger.</p><p>Time passed quickly. Soon, two days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming received a message from Xie Luan. It was a success. Xie Luan had successfully taken control of the demon deity Valley. Everyone in the demon deity Valley, including the Emperor, had surrendered to him.</p><p>Obviously, like the myriad demons abyss, Xie Luan had a backup plan. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to subdue an Overlord so easily.</p><p>Next, the inter-territory teleportation formations were connected.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and the Army set off.</p><p>As for cold-blood Hall, only a few people were left to guard it.</p><p>More than 100000 soldiers were teleported to the demon God Valley through the teleportation formation.</p><p>Lu Ming was the last group to set off with Yan kuangtu and the others.</p><p>Demon God Valley was one of the five Overlord forces of Northern Plains, it was very powerful and had an Emperor overseeing it, it was located in the vast mountains.</p><p>There were countless valleys of various sizes inside, and demonic energy filled the air, making it suitable for those of the demonic Dao to cultivate.</p><p>On the second day of Lu Ming’s arrival at the demon God Valley, the Army gathered in a huge Valley, with Xie Luan and Lu Ming standing at the forefront.</p><p>Beside them, there were two other people. One was Mo Ye, and the other was a burly old man called qu Luo, the Emperor of the demon God Valley.</p><p>In the valley, the myriad demons abyss, the demon God Valley, and the talisman sect’s experts that Lu Ming had brought with him gathered.</p><p>Northern Plains has a total of five Overlord forces, each of them is very strong. If we want to take down the other four Overlord forces, we have to strike as fast as lightning. Right now, they still do not know about Demon God Valley, if we wait for them to make sufficient preparations, our battle will become much more difficult!</p><p>I have discussed with commander Lu. He and I will each lead an Army to attack two forces. I will lead the Army alone and be in charge of the Golden Wave cliff and the light Dragon Pagoda.</p><p>commander Lu, Mo Ye, qu Luo, you will lead a large Army and be in charge of mountain piercing sect and hundred beasts tribe. Take them down with lightning speed, that way, Northern Plains will be under our control!</p><p>Xie Luan announced.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Army received the order.</p><p>Although the people from the demon God Valley, qu Luo, and the others were puzzled as to why Xie Luan would form an alliance with Lu Ming, they did not ask much. They only had to follow Xie Luan’s orders.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>A huge warship appeared in the sky. Lu Ming and Xie Luan took one warship each and flew in two different directions.</p><p>The first target of Lu Ming’s Army was the mountain-piercing sect.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>As they neared the mountain piercing sect, a loud roar could be heard.</p><p>In the mountain piercing sect, countless rays of light shone as the sect’s protective formation rose.</p><p>Auras burst forth as figures flickered and appeared in front of the mountain Gate of the pangolin sect.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s warship stopped a few thousand miles away from the pangolin sect. Lu Ming was the first to step out of the ship, followed by the dense Army. They stepped out of the warship and appeared in front of the pangolin sect.</p><p>“Who has come?”</p><p>die! an angry roar came from within the pangolin sect. A terrifying aura soared into the sky and suppressed everything within tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>A tall figure, covered in a yellow glow, appeared at the front of the pangolin sect.</p><p>An Emperor!</p><p>Obviously, this was the Emperor of the mountain piercing sect.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Qu Luo and Mo Ye stepped forward and came to the front. The emperor’s might bloomed from their bodies and pressed forward.</p><p>“Emperors, two emperors!”</p><p>Countless people in the pangolin sect exclaimed in shock.</p><p>There were actually two emperors gathered outside the mountain piercing sect. It seemed that they had come with ill intentions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
