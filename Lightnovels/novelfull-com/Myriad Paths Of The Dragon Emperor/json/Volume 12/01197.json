His eyes glowed with a golden light as he stared at Lu Ming. A powerful aura bloomed from him.</p><p>who would have thought that the divine wilderness continent would have such a decent expert. Not bad!</p><p>The Golden-armored youth coldly spoke.</p><p>“If you want to make a move, then make a move, no need to talk nonsense!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Hahaha, you’re very arrogant, but …”</p><p>The Golden-armored youth laughed heartily at first, but his eyes were cold and indifferent. His gaze swept past Lu Ming and landed on a courtyard in the forest.</p><p>in front of the heaven’s favorite of the Shen ‘e continent, you are still pretending to cultivate and act calm. It really makes me uncomfortable. So, I will deal with this guy first, and then I will deal with you!</p><p>After saying that, the young man in golden armor reached out his hand and grabbed at the air. A huge Golden Claw formed above the courtyard and grabbed towards the courtyard.</p><p>“He’s attacking Long Chen!”</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows slightly and the corners of his lips curled up.</p><p>He had long since discovered that Long Chen was the one living in that courtyard.</p><p>Long Chen hadn’t appeared since the beginning. He had been cultivating in the courtyard.</p><p>It was obvious that the Golden-armored young man had also noticed Long Chen. He was displeased that Long Chen was cultivating right under their noses. He wanted to take down Long Chen first before dealing with Lu Ming.</p><p>“It seems like I don’t need to do anything!”</p><p>Lu Ming mumbled and retreated to Xie nianqing’s side. He was happy to be free.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>When the Golden hand was about to grab him, a cold shout came from the courtyard. A fist light flew out and shattered the Golden hand.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A figure stepped out of the courtyard and appeared in the air. It was long Chen.</p><p>“Were you the one who attacked just now?”</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes were fixed on the Golden-armored youth.</p><p>“Not bad. I didn’t expect your cultivation to be …”</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Before the Golden-armored young man could finish his words, Long Chen’s figure had already approached the Golden-armored young man at an extreme speed. He threw a punch at him.</p><p>The pressure of this punch made the Golden armored youth’s face change. In a hurry, he also threw out a punch.</p><p>As the two fists met, the young man in golden armor’s face turned red. His body was sent flying backward, and his arm trembled. He almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“You dare to sneak attack me, despicable!”</p><p>The young man in golden armor roared, and a giant crocodile appeared above his head. Unlike the previous one, this giant crocodile was golden all over, as if it was made of gold.</p><p>It was also a divine level rank 9 bloodline.</p><p>The burly man in golden armor used bloodline fusion, and his aura became violent.</p><p>This person was at the middle stage of the fifth level spiritual God Realm and was much stronger than the youth in the scaled armor.</p><p>The Golden-armored young man turned into a giant crocodile and pounced toward Long Chen.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen’s aura skyrocketed, and his two arms became twice as thick as usual.</p><p>“That’s a dragon scale?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. On Long Chen’s arms, which had become thicker, he saw scales that looked like dragon scales.</p><p>could it be that Long Chen’s bloodline is a true dragon? ”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen’s hands continued to punch.</p><p>The first punch sent the young man’s tail flying. The second punch landed on the head of the crocodile, and the crocodile was forced back.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Long Chen took a step forward and closed in on the giant crocodile. He raised his huge fist and kept punching.</p><p>The fist force broke through everything. The giant crocodile could not resist and was constantly hit by the fist. The Golden-armored young man screamed in pain.</p><p>f * ck, another monster has appeared in the divine wilderness continent. He’s so strong that even a fifth level spiritual God Realm expert is not his match? ”</p><p>it seems like this person is the strongest person in the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Long Chen’s battle prowess caused the surrounding spectators to tremble in shock.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Mu Feng’s expression was cold. He snorted, but his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Long Chen was also someone he had to deal with, but his combat strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>After a few consecutive punches, the Golden armored youth wailed in pain.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>On the Shen ‘e continent, a young man shouted, and a powerful aura burst out from his body.</p><p>nonsense! If you want to fight, then let’s fight together! Don’t disturb my cultivation!</p><p>Long Chen berated.</p><p>“Detestable, how arrogant!”</p><p>he’s simply too arrogant. I suggest that we attack together and suppress this person!</p><p>“That’s right, let’s attack together!”</p><p>Long Chen’s disdainful attitude made the young men from the Shen ‘e continent roar. Their eyes were red with anger.</p><p>Each of them was a peerless heaven’s favorite. On the vast Shen ‘e continent, they were the top experts. Even the Emperor realm experts would not dare to look down on them. When had they ever been looked down upon like this?</p><p>All of them roared and wanted to attack together.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At least seven or eight young men from the Shen ‘e continent had their bloodlines emerging from their heads.</p><p>All of them had divine level rank 9 bloodlines, and all of them were giant crocodiles.</p><p>Most of the people on the Shen ‘e continent had inherited the bloodlines of ancient crocodiles, crocodile emperors, and crocodiles.</p><p>A total of seven youths used bloodline fusion to transform into crocodiles.</p><p>Two of them had especially powerful auras.</p><p>a late-stage fifth level spiritual God Realm and a peak fifth level spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He could tell the cultivation of the young man from the Shen ‘e continent.</p><p>Other than them, the others were all at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. As for those with lower cultivation, they did not make a move.</p><p>The seven masters turned into crocodiles and pounced at Long Chen.</p><p>this should force Long Chen to use his full strength!</p><p>Including Lu Ming, all the other youths from the divine wilderness continent had a look of curiosity in their eyes. They wanted to see Long Chen’s true strength.</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes also revealed a rare trace of fighting spirit.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>An earth-shaking roar was heard, and a huge creature appeared above Long Chen’s head.</p><p>It was a giant elephant, even larger than a mountain.</p><p>However, the difference between this giant elephant and ordinary elephants was that it was covered in scales, which were like Dragon Armor.</p><p>There were also nine golden chakras around the huge elephant.</p><p>However, the pressure emitted by the giant elephant was much stronger than the pressure emitted by other ninth level divine level bloodlines.</p><p>“This … This was … The Archean dragonesque elephant, someone has awakened the bloodline of the Archean dragonesque elephant?”</p><p>A surprised voice rang in Lu Ming’s ears. It was dandan. She seemed to have sensed the aura of the Dragon Star bloodline and appeared from the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Archean dragonesque elephant? Could he be a mixed-blood of a true dragon and a divine elephant?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>no, the Archean dragonesque elephant is an independent race. It has nothing to do with the real Dragon. In fact, it’s much stronger than the real Dragon. This is because the Archean dragonesque elephant is as famous as the nine Dragons. It’s one of the top ten war beasts as I am!</p><p>Dandan explained.</p><p>the Archean dragonesque elephant is one of the top ten Battle Beasts!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>No wonder Dragon Star was so powerful. It turned out that the bloodline it had awakened was one of the top ten war beasts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
