Who was it?</p><p>Many people were curious.</p><p>this name is very similar to the two princesses. It’s said that there’s a little princess in the royal family who has a different bloodline from the royal family. Could it be that Lu Ming is talking about this little princess? ”</p><p>Someone guessed.</p><p>In the end, many people sighed. It was not worth it for Lu Ming to put forward this condition. He had wasted a great opportunity.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s gaze was firm. In his heart, this was the most important thing.</p><p>The Masters of the Wang and Jiang families, the divine Emperor, and the rest heaved a sigh of relief. They were really afraid that Lu Ming would ask Xie Qitian to protect him.</p><p>“Haha, how stupid!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan laughed in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming, don’t be delusional. Xie nianqing is a weirdo. You want to set her free? what a joke!</p><p>also, back in the nine Dragons city of the East continent, it was you who repeatedly obstructed us and even injured my royal family members. Today, you still dare to say such words. You’re really audacious!</p><p>Xie Zhen stood up and looked at Lu Ming coldly as he berated him loudly.</p><p>“What? How dare you hurt someone from the royal family? Lu Ming, you first sneaked into the law enforcement Army and deliberately destroyed the relationship between the royal family and the other Overlord forces. What are your intentions?”</p><p>A middle-aged man stood up and said coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming recognized him. He was the Imperial uncle who had appeared in the Hall of Justice when Lu Ming was confronting the elder of the heaven martial sword faction, Xie qiyu.</p><p>Because of Lu Ming, their relationship with the heaven’s martial sword faction had worsened, forcing Xie qiyu to show up. He was already unhappy with Lu Ming, and now, he naturally came out to berate him.</p><p>it’s indeed the little princess of the imperial family, that mutant!</p><p>Xie Zhen’s words made everyone’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>But how did Lu Ming get to know that little princess?</p><p>It seemed that in the East wilderness, the imperial family had suffered at the hands of Lu Ming. This Lu Ming was really a monster.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Xie Zhen and Xie qiyu, then ignored them and faced the sage Emperor. “Saint-Emperor, you said before that if you could place in the top three, you would be able to raise a condition. My condition is to set nianqing free. I don’t need anything else, nor do I have to enter the ancient Hall!”</p><p>Lu Ming stood straight, neither servile nor overbearing, and his gaze was firm.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s brows furrowed even more, and his face turned cold. “Lu Ming, this won’t do. You’d better change your condition!”</p><p>His tone was filled with an unquestionable tone.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s meaning was already very clear. That was impossible.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not give up just like that.</p><p>“Sage Emperor, why don’t you let him go? is it because nianqing’s bloodline is different from the rest of the imperial family? Could it be that only those with pure bloodlines were members of the Xie family? Wouldn’t the Xie family be inclined towards the dark bloodline? Please forgive this Junior’s foolish opinion, but this way of thinking is too pedantic!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice spread throughout the entire venue and everyone quieted down.</p><p>Almost everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>How bold of Lu Ming to speak to the sage Emperor in such a manner. Even a fool could tell that Lu Ming was implying that the sage Emperor was pedantic.</p><p>Audacious, he was truly audacious. Even the other Kings would not dare to speak to Xie Qitian in such a manner. Lu Ming’s words were simply too shocking.</p><p>“How dare you! How dare you! Lu Ming, you lowly ant! How dare you speak to my father like that? you’re courting death!”</p><p>Xie Zhen roared.</p><p>“He deserves to die ten thousand times and his entire clan should be exterminated!”</p><p>Xie Qi Yu shouted coldly. Although his words were short, his killing intent was soaring.</p><p>Xie Qitian did not say a word. He was still frowning, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ignore Xie Zhen and Xie Qitian. He did not even look at them and continued to face Xie Qitian.”Bloodline is just a tool for martial artists. It depends on how you use it. If you use it well, it’s good. If you don’t use it well, it’s not good. The key is still the person who uses it!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was loud and clear, neither servile nor overbearing. He had no fear and argued strongly.</p><p>ridiculous! That’s nonsense! Xie nianqing is of a foreign bloodline. She’s a rebel. If we let her go, she would have turned against us!</p><p>Xie Zhen continued to berate him.</p><p>“Haha, what a joke. What is a rebellious bloodline? Back then, wasn’t the chaotic heavens divine warrior forced out? if the entire imperial family treated him equally, without any humiliation or oppression, why would he have betrayed us?”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed heartily.</p><p>As soon as he said that, everyone was shocked.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the imperial family, a terrifying aura suddenly burst out. A cold killing intent enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Audacious fanatic, you’re courting death!”</p><p>“He should be killed!”</p><p>“Heinous crimes!”</p><p>One after another, howls sounded out as the powerful existences were enraged. Their terrifying auras filled the sky as if the world was about to be destroyed.</p><p>Endless pressure pressed down on Lu Ming. There were many Supreme-beings among them.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming used all his strength to resist, but he was still suppressed by the pressure. His body trembled and he retreated rapidly, a mouthful of blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The chaotic heavens divine warrior was a taboo of the royal family. Lu Ming had actually dared to mention it on such an occasion. He had touched the royal family’s sore spot.</p><p>“Sage Emperor, there’s an ancient saying that a sovereign can not be ridiculed. Moreover, you are the sage Emperor. Are you going to go back on your word?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted.</p><p>He had already come this far today and there was no way out. Lu Ming had nothing to fear. He could only move forward bravely.</p><p>“When I said I would agree to one condition, I meant that it was something I could do!” Said Xie Qitian.</p><p>“What’s so difficult about my conditions? Moreover, nianqing is your daughter, your biological daughter. Did you give birth to her just to lock her up for the rest of her life?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The vital essence in his body circulated crazily and the five-colored will enveloped his body to resist the pressure that was pressing on him.</p><p>“Impudent! Men, kill this person!”</p><p>Xie Zhen roared. His killing intent was boundless, and his face revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>Back in ninedragons, he had gone there as the Prince of the ancient Saint dynasty. He should have been high and mighty, but Lu Ming had defeated him in front of everyone, embarrassing him.</p><p>He had always harbored a grudge against Lu Ming. Even after such a long time, he had not forgotten about it. Now that he had such an opportunity, he naturally could not wait to cut Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Two guards in iron armor shouted. A terrifying aura burst out as they stepped forward to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone sighed and thought that Lu Ming was definitely going to die today. It was such a pity to lose such a prodigy.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, Xie Qitian spoke indifferently and waved his hand. The two guards immediately stopped, and the other members of the imperial family also retracted their auras.</p><p>Lu Ming felt his body relax and he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Lu Ming, I’m an Emperor, and I’m a man of my word. However, your condition is an important matter for the royal family, and I can’t agree to it so easily. How about this? nianqing is now in the abyss demon territory, fighting for the royal family and killing the Mosha clan. If you’re willing to enter the abyss demon territory and kill the Mosha clan, once you’ve killed enough Mosha clan members and accumulated enough achievements for the royal family, I’ll let you leave together!</p><p>Xie Qitian muttered to himself.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. Xie Qitian’s words meant that he had already given in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
