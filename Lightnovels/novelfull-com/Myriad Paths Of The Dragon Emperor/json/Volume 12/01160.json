If Lu Ming was here, he would be able to recognize that the ball was exactly the same as the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument floating above his head.</p><p>This was the heaven’s secrets instrument’s main body.</p><p>In the sky above the heaven’s secrets device, there was a huge array board that was emitting a mysterious light.</p><p>Around the heaven’s secrets instrument, there were a dozen people standing quietly and observing.</p><p>suddenly, the heaven’s secrets instrument began to shine, and a dot of light appeared on the disk array above it.</p><p>More than a dozen people at the scene were alarmed.</p><p>“The heaven’s secrets instrument has sensed something. The array disc has a light spot. Lu Ming has appeared. He’s within a million miles!”</p><p>An old man called out in disbelief.</p><p>Shouldn’t lu Ming be hiding somewhere far away? How could he still dare to appear within a million miles of the sacred city?</p><p>look, he’s quickly approaching the holy city!</p><p>“He’s approaching the holy city!”</p><p>The others all exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>The disk array showed that the dot of light was rapidly approaching the holy city. This meant that Lu Ming was heading toward the holy city.</p><p>“Quick, spread the news!”</p><p>The old man in the lead said. Then, they all took out their Jade voice transmission talismans and sent the news out.</p><p>In fact, there was no need for them to spread the news. In the holy city, some people had sensed the heaven’s secrets energy field array disc and discovered this at the same time. Lu Ming was actually approaching the holy city at a high speed.</p><p>Many experts in the sacred city were alarmed.</p><p>More powerful cultivators from the royal family and the Xie family were alarmed. They flew out from all directions toward the eastern city wall of the holy city. According to the array disc, Lu Ming was coming from the east and would be close to the eastern city wall.</p><p>For a moment, wind and clouds gathered on the eastern wall of the sacred city. Many experts arrived, and the city wall was filled with people.</p><p>“They’re coming, they’re almost there!”</p><p>Some people looked at the disk array and realized that the dot of light was getting closer and closer to the sacred city.</p><p>Not long after, a black-robed young man with long hair casually draped over his shoulders flew over from the distant sky.</p><p>Lu Ming, it was Lu Ming!</p><p>At this moment, the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument was suspended above Lu Ming’s head, shining brightly.</p><p>Earlier, Xie Luan had brought Lu Ming along and tore through space in the direction of the holy city. When they were within a million miles of the holy city, Xie Luan undid the seal on the door of seals and released the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument. Then, it entered Lu Ming’s spine and disappeared.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was stepping in the air and heading towards the holy city.</p><p>At that moment, everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>I didn’t expect Lu Ming to come to the holy city. Isn’t this like sending a sheep into a Tiger’s mouth? could it be that he knows that he can’t escape, so he came to turn himself in? ”</p><p>“It’s possible. It’s strange. I remember that during the million-year sacrifice, Lu Ming took the initiative to enter the abyss Demon Realm and wanted to take the sixteenth Princess away. Moreover, the royal family even tried to kill us, and they even offered us a heavenly treasure like the heavenly secrets instrument!”</p><p>everyone is curious about this, let alone you. However, many of the royal family’s higher-ups do not know the exact reason, let alone us. However, there is one thing that we can be sure of. Lu Ming must have done something extraordinary to cause the royal family and the Xie family to be in such a state!</p><p>Some of the powerhouses from the other forces were secretly discussing, but no one made a move.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in the air a hundred miles away from the city wall.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how dare you break out of the abyss demon territory without permission? you’ve committed a terrible crime and should be executed by a thousand cuts!”</p><p>A gloomy voice sounded.</p><p>Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. It was Xie Zhen.</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at Xie Zhen and sneered. it’s ridiculous. I entered the abyss demon territory of my own will, and I can leave and stay as I please. Besides, Xie Qitian is obviously trying to keep me in the abyss demon territory for the rest of my life by getting those points. He even made it sound so Grand. What a despicable man!</p><p>How dare you! How dare you slander my father! I’m going to kill your entire family! No one can save you today!</p><p>Xie Zhen berated loudly with an air of superiority.</p><p>“Oh? Alright, in terms of age, you’re older than me. Make your move, come and kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Xie Zhen was stunned.</p><p>“Hmph, a loser, a piece of trash, do you dare to make a move? I can suppress you with one finger!”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly, his voice full of disdain.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s face was completely red.</p><p>In terms of age, he was of the same generation as Lu Ming and he was even older than Lu Ming. However, he did not dare to fight Lu Ming. Lu Ming could probably suppress him with one finger.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this time, a cold voice sounded.</p><p>The voice was clear and pleasant to the ears, but it was filled with a faint sense of pride.</p><p>A peerless beauty in a snow-white dress with a milky-white Radiance emanating from her body stepped through the air.</p><p>She was incomparably Holy, like a fairy from the nine Heavens descending to the mortal world. Her body bloomed with holy light, and with every step she took, a milky white Lotus flower would appear in the sky, supporting her feet.</p><p>“Ninth Princess!”</p><p>“Thank you, nianjun!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were attracted by this figure.</p><p>She was Xie nianjun, one of the five beauties of the central continent and ranked second among the five young tycoons.</p><p>This proud daughter of the heavens, a proud daughter of the heavens who had gathered thousands of halos on her.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze also fell on her.</p><p>Her appearance was very similar to Xie nianqing’s, but her temperament was completely different.</p><p>Lu Ming had long known that Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun had the same father but not the same mother. It was amazing that they looked so similar.</p><p>Xie nianjun stepped into the air and stood in front of the crowd. He looked at Lu Ming and said in a cold and arrogant voice, ” “Lu Ming, you were the one who took Xie nianqing away, right? Hand her over, the variant of the Xie family with a lowly and dirty bloodline. She will guard the demon area of hell forever and hunt down the Mosha clan for the Xie family to compensate for what she owes the Xie family.”</p><p>“Hahaha, laughable, truly laughable!”</p><p>Xie nianjun’s words made Lu Ming burst out laughing uncontrollably.</p><p>“You’re saying that nianqing owes your Xie family? You really know how to distort the truth. In my opinion, it’s your Xie family that owes nianqing, and you won’t be able to pay it back in your lifetime!”</p><p>Lu Ming laughed out loud.</p><p>her bloodline has tarnished the reputation of the Royal Xie family. What else does she owe the Xie family? ”</p><p>Xie nianjun said with a frown.</p><p>“Dogshit! ‘All of you are f * cking Bullsh * t! A bunch of self-righteous people! What is your Xie family?’ What was the royal family? No wonder the ancient Saint dynasty has become so weak. To be controlled by such a group of short-sighted people, it would be strange if they aren’t weak. In my opinion, the ancient Saint dynasty should be destroyed!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice spreading throughout the entire venue.</p><p>Especially the last sentence,’the ancient Saint dynasty shall be destroyed’, which made many people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>He was too bold. He was simply too audacious. Lu Ming actually dared to say such words in public. This was an insult to the Royal Xie family and a slap to their face.</p><p>Sure enough, many people from the imperial family and the Xie family went crazy. Their faces turned red as they angrily rebuked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
