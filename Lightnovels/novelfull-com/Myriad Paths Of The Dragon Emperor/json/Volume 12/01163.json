The nine Dragons’ huge bodies were like lightning, unbelievably fast as they approached the white-haired old man.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Seeing that he was about to be caught up by the nine Dragons, the white-haired old man screamed in horror and became hoarse. He was as flustered as a stray dog, and he couldn’t care less about his demeanor as a powerful man. At this time, his life was more important.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and stretched out their claws. A powerful force blasted on the white-haired old man’s body, almost piercing through it. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his eyes were even more frightened.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The white-haired old man screamed with all his might, like a helpless girl facing a group of fierce bandits.</p><p>“Still not stopping, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>you’re courting death! a furious roar came from the walls of the sacred city. A tall figure rushed out, and a vast and unfathomable aura exploded.</p><p>Being enveloped by this aura, everyone felt that it was difficult to breathe. A huge rock was pressing down on their hearts, and they had a feeling that a great disaster was imminent.</p><p>Supreme martial artist!</p><p>A word emerged in everyone’s heart. This was a Supreme martial artist. The Supreme martial artist of the imperial family had made his move.</p><p>“Thank you, Qi Yu!”</p><p>Lu Ming could tell with a single glance that the person who had attacked was Xie Zhen’s Imperial uncle, the younger brother of the current Sacred Emperor, Xie qiyu.</p><p>He was a Supreme Being.</p><p>you dare to be impudent in the holy city? I’ll cripple you right now!</p><p>Xie qiyu’s cold voice rang out from his mouth as he sent out a palm strike. A huge palm print formed out of thin air and covered the sky as it flew towards Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of this palm print, Lu Ming was as small as an ant.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm and there was no fluctuation in his eyes.</p><p>This was because at this moment, there was a surge of powerful energy flowing into Lu Ming’s body. It was Xie Luan’s energy.</p><p>“So what if you’re a Supreme martial artist? Xie Qi Yu, you won’t be able to save him today!”</p><p>The nine Dragons howled as they clawed at Xie Tianyu’s palm.</p><p>“What? He dares to take an Autarch’s attack head on?”</p><p>“He’s looking for death, he’s looking for death!”</p><p>“He had no other choice but to die a heroic death. To die at the hands of a Paragon is a life worth living!”</p><p>Many people thought that Lu Ming was at his wit’s end and would rather be killed by a Supreme martial artist and die a heroic death.</p><p>Some people even sighed. Was this the end of such a rare genius of the divine wilderness continent?</p><p>But the next scene made them dumbfounded, their eyes almost popping out.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>When the nine Dragons ‘Dragon Claw landed on Xie qiyu’s palm print, the scene of Lu Ming being crushed into pieces that everyone had expected did not appear. On the contrary, when the Dragon Claw struck out, the heaven and earth shook. Xie qiyu’s palm print was actually pierced through by the nine Dragons’ Dragon Claw and collapsed with a loud bang.</p><p>“This … This …”</p><p>Everyone was stunned as they looked at the scene in disbelief.</p><p>Not only did Lu Ming block the Supreme-being’s attack, but he had also defeated it. How was this possible? What was going on?</p><p>Most of the people were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After destroying Xie qiyu’s palm print, the nine Dragons reached out with their claws again. A huge Dragon Claw appeared out of thin air above the white-haired old man’s head and clawed down.</p><p>The white-haired old man had almost reached the top of the city wall. He had just heaved a sigh of relief when his pupils suddenly widened. He let out a desperate roar, ” “No!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the next moment, he was crushed to death by the Dragon Claw.</p><p>“I’ve said it before, since you’ve entered the battle, you must die!”</p><p>The nine Dragons shrank and transformed into Lu Ming’s true form. Lu Ming said in a cold voice.</p><p>Many people gasped, especially Xie Zhen. He felt cold all over and his face was pale as he looked at Lu Ming in fear.</p><p>A peak eighth level spiritual God Realm expert was first severely injured and had to flee for his life in a sorry state. However, with the help of a Supreme-being, he was still killed by Lu Ming on the spot.</p><p>How arrogant, how arrogant, how overbearing.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>Xie qiyu bellowed in rage. His killing intent was incomparably cold and dense, as if it was about to materialize.</p><p>A terrifying aura filled the air, and the earth-shattering pressure of a Supreme-being spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and retreated quickly. Xie qiyu’s pressure could not stop him at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Xie qiyu shouted and was about to launch a lightning-like attack.</p><p>“Qi Yu, stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a majestic voice rang out.</p><p>Upon hearing this voice, Xie Qitian was slightly taken aback and stopped.</p><p>The sky suddenly split open, and three figures stepped out from the spatial crack.</p><p>The person in the lead was tall and burly, exuding boundless Majesty.</p><p>“Saint-Emperor!”</p><p>“We pay our respects to the sage Emperor!”</p><p>Many people quickly saluted.</p><p>This man was none other than the sage Emperor, Xie Qitian.</p><p>On the left and right of Xie Qitian stood two white-haired elders. Most people had seen them during the million-year sacrificial ceremony. They were also two emperors.</p><p>The Three Sovereigns moved out.</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled. At the same time, they were filled with endless doubts. Was there a need for the sage Emperor to personally appear just for Lu Ming? Moreover, there were two other emperors.</p><p>Xie Qitian and the two sovereigns stepped forward, stopping the battle between Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun.</p><p>“I’ll spare you today!”</p><p>Xie nianjun glared at Xie nianqing with killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>“We still don’t know who’ll let who off?” Xie nianqing responded strongly.</p><p>After that, the two of them left. Xie nianqing returned to Lu Ming’s side while Xie nianjun returned to Xie Qitian’s side.</p><p>Xie Qitian looked at Xie nianqing with a complicated expression. Then, his gaze fell on Lu Ming. With a serious look, he said,”Since you’re here, why don’t you come out? Why are you hiding?”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s words shocked many people. Could it be that Xie Qitian’s target was someone else?</p><p>Demonic Qi seeped out of Lu Ming’s body. In the end, the demonic Qi gathered around him and condensed into a human figure. It was Xie Luan.</p><p>“There’s really someone here!”</p><p>Some of them had an idea. They guessed that Lu Ming’s ability to withstand the Supreme-being’s attack earlier was related to this person.</p><p>However, some of them were stunned when they saw Xie Luan. Their eyes widened and their mouths opened wider and wider. In the end, their entire bodies trembled violently.</p><p>“Impossible, how is that possible?”</p><p>“Why are they so similar? How did this happen?”</p><p>These people mumbled to themselves, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>This was especially so for the royal family’s Xie family, such as Xie Zhen and Xie Qi Yu. It was as if they had seen a ghost, and their eyes widened in horror.</p><p>“Who is this person? Why do the people of the imperial family and the Xie clan seem to be so frightened?”</p><p>Those who had never seen Xie Lun’s portrait or statue were full of doubts.</p><p>However, they soon found out the answer.</p><p>“Thank you, chaos!”</p><p>Xie Qitian slowly and heavily spat out two words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
