It could refine all energy, even intent realms, to quickly improve cultivation and upgrade the bloodline.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline played a huge role in Lu Ming’s current achievements.</p><p>One could only imagine how terrifying the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline, which was on par with the nine Dragons, was.</p><p>the Archean dragonesque elephant is famous for its combat strength among the top ten Battle Beasts. It has infinite strength and can penetrate the world and suppress everything. It’s terrifyingly powerful. This man has awakened the bloodline of the Archean dragonesque elephant. He’s amazing!</p><p>Dandan sighed.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The Dragon and elephant let out a long roar, and its might spread out, causing the faces of the proud sons of heaven of the Shen ‘e continent to change.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen transformed into a Dragon elephant and stomped on the Golden-armored youth’s crocodile body.</p><p>The Golden crocodile exploded, and the Golden-armored young man appeared. He was bleeding all over, and blood was spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>It was obvious that Long Chen had been merciful. He had not killed him, but he had severely injured him.</p><p>OWW!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant let out a long hiss and swept with its trunk. The bloodlines of three fourth level spiritual God Realm geniuses crumbled one after another as their bodies were sent flying and they screamed in pain.</p><p>“Combine our strength!”</p><p>The strongest person on the Shen ‘e continent was an existence at the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. He shouted and whipped his tail at the Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant was surprisingly agile. It took two steps forward, and a terrifying energy burst forth, blocking its opponent. At the same time, its two tusks glowed, and two rays of light burst out like two heavenly blades.</p><p>A few more heaven’s favorites ‘bloodline forms were destroyed. They turned back into human form and flew out screaming.</p><p>In the sky, only two fifth level spiritual God Realm geniuses from the Shen ‘e continent remained.</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant stepped out, shaking the sky. Its combat strength was extremely powerful. Although the two heaven’s favorites from the Shen ‘e continent tried their best, they could not resist it and were completely crushed.</p><p>In just a few moves, the two of them cried out in pain. The power of their bloodlines dissipated, and they turned back into human form. They retreated madly, blood spurting from their mouths as they looked at the huge Dragon-elephant in the sky in fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Archean dragonesque elephant shrunk, and Long Chen reappeared. He glanced at the geniuses of the Shen ‘e continent and said coldly, ” “Get lost!”</p><p>The proud sons of heaven from the Shen ‘e continent had ugly expressions on their faces, but they did not dare to stay any longer. They took the injured and left, returning to soldier peak.</p><p>so powerful. Who is this person? he’s so powerful that even a peerless genius at the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm can’t withstand a single blow!</p><p>he’s indeed too strong. To think that a mere divine wilderness continent would have such a person. Only the top ten continents would have such combat power!</p><p>it’s really amazing. We have another strong opponent in the selection of disciples of the heavenly God sect this time!</p><p>In the distance, there were paragons from the other continents and the divine Ruins continent. They looked at Long Chen with grave expressions.</p><p>“Damn it, how can this person be so strong?”</p><p>Mu Feng gritted his teeth and his expression turned ugly. He had wanted the people from the Shen ‘e continent to give the divine wilderness continent a good beating. He did not expect the result to be the complete opposite.</p><p>Long Chen’s face was calm. Without saying a word, he returned to his courtyard and continued cultivating.</p><p>“What a strange person!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“How is it? Are you confident?”</p><p>Xie nianqing blinked his big eyes and looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Did he mean that Lu Ming was not confident in defeating Long Chen?</p><p>the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm and the Archean dragonesque elephant bloodline are indeed freakishly strong. However, when have I ever lost in a battle of the same level? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled confidently.</p><p>He had a rough idea of Long Chen’s strength.</p><p>“You’re so smug!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pouted, but he still had a smile on his face.</p><p>As the two of them conversed, they returned to the courtyard and continued cultivating.</p><p>There were less than three months before the selection of the disciples of the Tian Shen sect. Everyone wanted to seize the time to cultivate and improve their strength. The stronger they were, the higher the chance of being selected.</p><p>Time flew by, and half a month had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming cultivated diligently every day and made great progress. He had improved a lot in all kinds of concepts. However, his earth concept was still at the peak of the lower tier of level four and had not entered the upper tier.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had cultivated the nine Dragons heaven treading steps to the eighth step in one go.</p><p>The eighth step was already equivalent to the power of a high-grade divine level martial arts technique. With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, he could not unleash its full power. However, when he cast it, the power would undoubtedly be stronger, and Lu Ming’s combat strength would be enhanced again.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing left together.</p><p>It had been more than half a month since they came to the divine Ruins continent’s South deity Palace, and they had yet to walk around. The two of them planned on walking around and experiencing the local customs of the divine Ruins continent. They also wanted to see if there were any treasures, spiritual herbs, and materials that the divine wilderness continent did not have. They could buy some of them.</p><p>In particular, some of the ingredients for the Nirvana elixir were already very difficult to find in the divine wilderness continent. However, in the divine Ruins continent, it might not be the same. Perhaps, he could find some!</p><p>The two of them flew out of the general peak and headed towards a bustling Street.</p><p>“Brother Lu, miss Xie, what a coincidence!”</p><p>A voice came from the side.</p><p>“Brother ye!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a look. It was ye Chuan.</p><p>“Are the two of you planning to go shopping?”</p><p>Ye Chuan said.</p><p>“That’s right, I’ve been here for half a month and I haven’t even taken a look around!”</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Do the two of you have a place to go?” Ye Chuan asked.</p><p>no, I’m just looking around to see if I can buy some materials, spirit herbs, and the like!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>if it’s ordinary spiritual herbs and materials, ordinary markets will have them. If it’s rare materials and spiritual medicines, it’s hard to find them in ordinary markets. I do know a place where you can obtain some very precious materials and spiritual medicines.</p><p>Ye Chuan said.</p><p>“Oh? What place is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Treasure Exchange Tower!”</p><p>“Treasure Exchange Tower?” Lu Ming was puzzled.</p><p>as the name implies, the treasure Exchange Tower is a place to exchange treasures. As long as you enter, you can take out treasures you don’t need and Exchange them for treasures you need from others. If someone needs them, they will naturally take them out to exchange. In this way, you can obtain some rare treasures!</p><p>Ye Chuan explained.</p><p>“There’s such a place? let’s go take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>haha, I was also going to the treasure Exchange Tower. Let me lead the way!</p><p>Ye Chuan said generously.</p><p>Ye Chuan led the way, and the three of them landed on a Street. They walked along the street, took a detour, and came to a huge building.</p><p>It was a Pavilion, but it was extremely wide and occupied a large area. It had seven floors and reached straight into the sky. In front of many buildings, there were cranes and chickens.</p><p>The grid had red walls and green tiles. It was exquisitely carved and Grand. On the side, there was a plaque with three big words on it: Treasure Exchange Tower!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
