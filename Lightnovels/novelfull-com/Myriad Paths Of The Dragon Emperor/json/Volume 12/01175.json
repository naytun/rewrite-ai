Do you want a kiss?”</p><p>The second body suddenly laughed.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s consciousness entering the second body and speaking.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face turned red and he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>The second body pointed at Lu Ming and took a step forward. It shrunk rapidly and entered the space between Lu Ming’s eyebrows, sitting cross-legged in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>At that moment, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the rest were looking at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing in shock.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what’s your cultivation? What realm have you reached?”</p><p>Bai Shijin asked.</p><p>In fact, he had already seen through Lu Ming’s cultivation. He just found it hard to believe.</p><p>peak fourth level spiritual God Realm. Senior, what’s wrong? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others gasped.</p><p>It had only been two years or so. Back then, Lu Ming had set off from the East wilderness to the central continent, and his cultivation was only at the eighth level of the spirit embryo realm. However, in two years, not only had Lu Ming crossed the path of the spiritual God Realm, but he had also reached the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. This was truly too shocking.</p><p>They were well aware of how difficult it was to advance one level after reaching the spiritual God Realm. However, it seemed to be no difficulty for Lu Ming.</p><p>And …</p><p>They looked at Xie nianqing.</p><p>They could naturally see Xie nianqing’s cultivation. He was at the peak of the third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Strong, he was too strong.</p><p>Most importantly, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were still so young. They were only in their twenties. It was shocking that they had already reached this stage at such a young age.</p><p>In comparison, the paragons of the talisman Amulet sect paled in comparison to Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Perhaps, Lu Ming can really lead the talisman Amulet sect to rise!”</p><p>They thought to themselves.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the teleportation array shook slightly, and two more figures appeared.</p><p>It was Xie Lun and Mo Ye.</p><p>Subconsciously, Bai Shijin, du songjue, and the others used their spiritual senses to scan Xie Lun and Mo Ye. Their expressions changed drastically as they cried out in alarm.</p><p>“Emperor! It’s the Emperor!”</p><p>“Two emperors!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others exclaimed in shock. They were on high alert and their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Seniors, this is Xie Luan, senior Xie. This is Mo Ye demon Emperor!”</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly introduced.</p><p>“Chaotic heavens divine warrior, Xie Luan!”</p><p>Bai Shijin and the others were shocked.</p><p>The name of the chaotic heavens divine warrior was not only known to the powerhouses of the central continent, but also the East barren, the South underworld, and other territories. Naturally, Bai Shijin and the others knew about him.</p><p>After that, Bai Shijin and the others hurriedly paid their respects to Xie Luan and Mo Ye.</p><p>MMH!</p><p>Xie Luan nodded casually, and spread out his spiritual sense.</p><p>I didn’t expect the talisman sect to not be here either. Back then, it was a famous sect in the eastern barren territory!</p><p>Xie Luan spoke slowly, making Bai Shijin and the others feel a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Senior Xie, I’ll take you around!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He was in a good mood after returning to the talisman Amulet sect after two years.</p><p>This place was the force that truly belonged to Lu Ming. It was the force that he could control.</p><p>Xie Luan’s power was merely an Alliance.</p><p>Xie Luan nodded, and the group stepped on the air and flew into the distance.</p><p>On the way, Xie Luan glanced around and nodded to himself.</p><p>“It seems that I’ve underestimated Lu Ming. Other than not having an Emperor, he’s not considered weak. What a powerful junior! He’s trying to break through to the Emperor realm. Once he does, he’ll be extraordinary!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes flickered with light as he looked to the North.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Xie Luan had sensed the nine suns Paragon.</p><p>In the past two years, Supreme nine suns had been in seclusion, trying to break through to the position of Emperor.</p><p>“Father, mother!”</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the front.</p><p>In front of them, Yan kuangtu formed a cloud with his vital essence and brought Lu Yuntian, Li Ping, Hua Chi, Bai chixue, and the others toward them.</p><p>Obviously, they had received the news that Lu Ming had returned.</p><p>Initially, only a few people knew that Lu Ming had left for the central continent and stayed behind to guard the talisman Amulet sect. Other than Bai Shijing, Yan kuangtu and a few other Supreme martial artists, only Lu Ming’s parents knew.</p><p>However, ever since Lu Ming’s true identity was exposed during the million-year sacrificial battle in the sacred city, the news of Lu Ming’s appearance in the East barren had spread after the Masters of the Wang family, the Jiang family, and the divine Emperor had returned. The Empyrean divine Palace had publicly exposed that Lu Ming’s second body was fake outside the yin and yang mountain.</p><p>The rest of the talisman Amulet sect then knew that Lu Ming had left the yin and yang mountain and headed to the central continent.</p><p>Of course, no one would have thought that the Twin forbidden spell was such a wondrous secret technique. They all thought that the second body of Lu Ming in the talisman sect was a disguise by someone else.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had returned and they received the news, they naturally wanted to meet him.</p><p>Lu Ming pulled Xie nianqing and flew forward to greet Lu Yuntian and Li Ping.”Father, mother!”</p><p>“Ming ‘er, it’s good that you’re back!”</p><p>Although Lu Yuntian and Li Ping knew that Lu Ming had been safe and sound through his second body, they were still overjoyed to see his real body.</p><p>Then, the two of them looked at Xie nianqing. After a moment of surprise, they smiled.</p><p>Li Ping happily held Xie nianqing’s hand and said, ” “Miss nianqing, long time no see. Ming ‘er has finally brought you back! Good, good!”</p><p>“Uncle, Auntie!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s little face was slightly red as he bowed to Lu Yuntian and Li Ping. The two elders nodded repeatedly, extremely happy.</p><p>haha, this must be sister-in-law. She’s truly a national beauty and a rare one in the world!</p><p>Yan kuangtu laughed out loud, causing Xie nianqing’s face to turn even redder.</p><p>“Big brother Yan!”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted Yan kuangtu, Hua Chi, and the others.</p><p>In the crowd, Bai chixue looked at Xie nianqing with a lonely look in her eyes.</p><p>“Is this the woman Lu Ming likes? Back then, in a fit of anger, she caused a Great War in ninedragons. She is truly devastatingly beautiful. Only a woman like her is worthy of Lu Ming!”</p><p>Bai chixue sighed in her heart and forced a smile on her face. She stepped forward and greeted Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming then introduced Xie Luan and Mo Ye to Yan kuangtu and the others.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had only introduced them by name and not by their cultivation level. Only Yan kuangtu could sense Xie Luan and Mo Ye’s cultivation level, and his heart trembled.</p><p>father, mother, you should return to your residence first. I still have some matters to attend to with the seniors. I’ll come find you later!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, it’s fine. You can go ahead with your work!”</p><p>Lu Yuntian said.</p><p>Then, they went back.</p><p>Yan Kuang tu stayed behind.</p><p>“Senior Xie, the talisman Amulet sect is currently besieged by the Emperor heaven divine Palace. The palace Master of the Emperor God divine Palace is an Emperor. Do you have the confidence to deal with him?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
