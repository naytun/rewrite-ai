However, recently, the prodigies of the various continents have gathered. I heard that Ji hongchen has reserved the entire place for the prodigies of the younger generation to exchange for treasures!</p><p>...</p><p>Ye Chuan explained.</p><p>“Ji hongchen?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were slightly stunned.</p><p>haha, Ji hongchen is one of the three strongest heaven’s favorites in our South God Palace. He is a peerless beauty. Perhaps he is on the highest level today. If there is a chance, we might be able to meet him!</p><p>When Ji hongchen was mentioned, ye Chuan’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and the three of them walked towards the treasure Exchange Tower.</p><p>The treasure Exchange Tower had a total of seven floors. One had to pay a certain fee to enter. To enter the first floor, one had to pay 1000 raw stones per person. The higher the floor, the higher the number of raw stones needed to be paid.</p><p>The three of them paid the fee and stepped into a door of light.</p><p>That’s right, the doors of the treasure Exchange Tower were not ordinary doors. They were all teleportation doors. Entering meant being teleported in.</p><p>After the three of them stepped through the portal, they appeared on the side of a Hall.</p><p>The hall was extremely spacious and huge. Rows of tables and chairs were arranged in the surroundings of the hall. At this moment, many people were already seated on those tables and chairs.</p><p>In the middle of the tables and chairs, there was a large open space. At this moment, a young man was standing in the open space, holding a treasure in his hand.</p><p>a piece of [ Flint Star Iron ], a top-tier Lv 7 blacksmithing material. It can be exchanged for three wind god pills. Whoever has three wind god pills can have this piece of [ Flint Star Iron ]!</p><p>The young man looked around and his voice spread throughout the hall.</p><p>I happen to have three wind god pills. I’ll trade with you!</p><p>After a while, a young woman stood up, took out a Jade bottle, and handed it to the young man. The young man opened the Jade bottle and looked at it. He revealed a happy expression and said, it’s really the wind god pill. Thank you. This piece of [ sui star refined iron ] is for you!</p><p>The young man handed the [ sui star refined iron ] to the young woman. They both got what they wanted and sat down with joy.</p><p>the first level is for those whose cultivation is not high. There are rarely any high-quality items here. Let’s go up!</p><p>Ye Chuan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He used his spiritual senses to scan the area and realized that most of the youths on this level were below the spiritual god level.</p><p>The three of them walked towards another door of light.</p><p>The passage between each level required a teleportation gate.</p><p>There were also guards at the teleportation gate. The three of them handed over the orirocks and stepped into the teleportation gate.</p><p>The layout of the second floor was exactly the same as the first floor, but there were fewer people. However, their cultivation was stronger than the first floor.</p><p>In the first few levels, the three of them did not stop.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the fifth floor.</p><p>“Brother ye, do you still want to continue going up? I’ll stay on this floor and see if there’s anything I need.”</p><p>Ye Chuan said.</p><p>“Please go ahead, brother ye. We’ll go up and take a look again!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The materials required for the Nirvana elixir were extremely rare. The higher one went, the higher the cultivation level of the geniuses, and the higher the possibility of them appearing.</p><p>Lu Ming intended to continue to move upwards.</p><p>“Good, I wish you good luck. You can exchange for what you need!”</p><p>Ye Chuan cupped his fists and walked to the hall. He sat down on a chair.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing continued to walk towards a door of light and arrived at the sixth level.</p><p>On the sixth floor, there were even fewer people. At a glance, there were only about fifty people. Each one of them was a young man with a powerful aura. They all had the potential to become Dragons and phoenixes.</p><p>Obviously, they were all heaven’s favorites from different continents.</p><p>After reaching this floor, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing did not continue to go up. Instead, they walked towards the tables and chairs at the side of the hall.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming noticed a few cold gazes sweeping toward them.</p><p>“So you are from the Shen ‘e continent!”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled up slightly. He ignored the looks from the God’s alligator continent’s Paragon and sat down at a table by the side.</p><p>At this moment, in the middle of the hall, there was a young man holding a treasure, wanting to exchange it for the treasure he needed.</p><p>However, this young man asked several times, but no one answered. It was obvious that no one had the treasure he needed.</p><p>In the end, the young man sighed and left helplessly.</p><p>After this person retreated, another person stepped forward with a milky white horn in his hand.</p><p>this is the horn of a sacred light Tiger. It’s a top-grade eighth-grade material, and can be exchanged for a low-grade divine-grade movement technique. Whoever has it can take this sacred light Tiger’s horn!</p><p>The man introduced.</p><p>the treasures on the sixth floor are indeed of a much higher grade than the ones on the lower floors!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>However, the sacred light Tiger’s horn wasn’t something that he and Xie nianqing needed, so the two of them naturally didn’t say anything.</p><p>“I’ll use a movement technique to exchange with you!”</p><p>A young man stood up and took out a secret manual. The two of them exchanged and both of them were happy.</p><p>Following that, the young men and women stepped forward one by one, took out their treasures, and told them what they needed.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible for everyone to exchange for the treasures they needed. Some people would settle for second best, and if someone could afford a good price, they would sell it directly for a sum of raw gemstones.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at it for half an hour. Unfortunately, they did not find the treasure they needed.</p><p>it seems like we have to go to the seventh floor to take a look!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly at Xie nianqing.</p><p>I have a piece of sky Thunder wood with me. I want to exchange it for a purple smoke fruit!</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard, jolting Lu Ming.</p><p>“Sky Thunder wood!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The sky Thunder wood actually had a powerful Thunder Power. It was very effective to use it to comprehend the Thunder mentality.</p><p>One of Lu Ming’s concepts was the Thunder concept. If he used the sky Thunder wood to comprehend it, he could save a lot of time on comprehending the Thunder concept.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not have any purple smoke fruit. He frowned slightly.</p><p>Fortunately, some of the other people present were also tempted, but no one said anything for a while. Clearly, there were no more purple smoke fruits.</p><p>“Are there no purple smoke fruits?”</p><p>The young man who took out the sky Thunder wood asked with a disappointed expression.</p><p>brother, is it possible to purchase it with raw stones? ”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>The young man who took out the sky Thunder wood pondered for a moment and said, ” since there’s no purple smoke fruit, I’ll buy it with raw stones. You can bid, and the one with the highest price will get it!</p><p>“I’ll pay five hundred thousand raw stones!”</p><p>Someone immediately made a bid.</p><p>“I’ll pay six hundred thousand!”</p><p>“I bid six hundred and fifty thousand!”</p><p>Soon, the price rose steadily, and it was called to eight hundred thousand raw stones.</p><p>The Thunder mentality was one of the nine commonly seen mentalities. Naturally, there were many people who had comprehended it, and there were also many people who made bids. Therefore, Lu Ming was not in a hurry to make a bid.</p><p>Very quickly, the price rose to one million raw stones.</p><p>“I’ll pay two million raw stones!”</p><p>At this time, a voice rang out, directly doubling the price.</p><p>it’s him! He’s a heaven’s favorite from the Shen ‘e continent!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered as he recognized the young man who suddenly raised the bid. This person was the strongest expert on the Shen ‘e continent. He was at the peak of the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm, but he was easily defeated by Long Chen half a month ago.</p><p>At this moment, he was staring at the sky lightning wood with a burning gaze.</p><p>This person’s bloodline was that of a giant crocodile filled with lightning attribute. What he had comprehended was also the concept of lightning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
