His cultivation was completely sealed by Lu Ming and he could not exert any strength.</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>The commander of the law enforcement Army was too ruthless. He even dared to suppress Wu Cang. How overbearing.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed Wu Cang and threw him to the side of the other three disciples of the sky martial sword faction.</p><p>The three disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction looked at each other and then at Wu Cang, who was standing at the side. Their expressions were very interesting.</p><p>Initially, they were suppressed by Lu Ming and were lying on the ground like dogs eating shit. They felt extremely humiliated. However, when they saw Wu Cang lying on the ground, they felt much better.</p><p>Even a heaven’s pride expert like Wu Cang was suppressed and laid on the ground. It made sense that they were lying on the ground.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Wu Cang howled like a wild beast. He was so angry, especially when he saw the strange looks from the people around him. He wanted to kill himself.</p><p>Of course, he was only thinking about it. How could he bear to die? he had a great future ahead of him.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed on a person in the sky not far away.</p><p>That person was Shi Fang. When he saw that even Wu Cang was suppressed, he was so scared that he almost peed his pants. He was about to sneak away when Lu Ming saw him.</p><p>His face revealed a smile that was uglier than crying, and said, ” “Minglu, you … What are you trying to do?”</p><p>“What do you want? You’re an Imperial Dragon Guard, but you actually brought people from the heavenly martial sword sect to deal with the law enforcement Hall. You’re a traitor, and you’re colluding with foreign enemies. What do you think I’m doing?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. His essential core exploded and he grabbed at Shi Fang in the air.</p><p>what? ” Shi Fang was shocked. He wanted to retreat, but he felt a terrible force envelop him. He couldn’t move. The next moment, a force pulled him down and he fell to the ground.</p><p>“Ah, don’t!”</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and stomped on Shi Fang’s dantian. Shi Fang arched his body like a big shrimp and let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>“My cultivation, my cultivation, you’ve destroyed my cultivation!”</p><p>Shi Fang let out a desperate roar.</p><p>The spirit embryo in his dantian was crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>“I’ll cripple your cultivation as punishment. Get lost!”</p><p>With that, he kicked and Shi Fang flew out like a ball. He turned into a black dot and disappeared in the air. Lu Ming did not know how far he had flown. He could not be bothered to think about whether he would fall to his death.</p><p>“Alright, not a bad harvest. What are you guys doing? Bring them all back to the law enforcement Hall!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at tie Xing and the rest.</p><p>“Bring … Bring him back to the law enforcement Hall?”</p><p>Tie Xing and the others looked at each other, their expressions ugly.</p><p>of course! Only by bringing them back will we have the capital to negotiate with them. Do you think that the heavenly martial sword faction will let this matter rest if you let them go? don’t just stand there, take them away!</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and grabbed Wu Cang. He stepped into the air and headed toward the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>Tie Xing and the rest were helpless. They could only bring the other three disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction and follow Lu Ming.</p><p>there’s going to be a great show. This matter will definitely attract the elders of the heavenly martial Sword School. Let’s go and take a look!</p><p>this commander is indeed powerful. However, let’s see how he’s going to deal with the elder generation of the heavenly Sword faction.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>There were tens of thousands of people in the surrounding crowd. They followed Lu Ming from a distance and headed towards the law enforcement Hall. Furthermore, the number of people was increasing.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming and the rest left, Xie Zhen and Shi Zheng rushed over. When they heard that Wu Cang was suppressed by Lu Ming, the two of them were dumbfounded and in disbelief.</p><p>Initially, they were certain that Wu Cang would beat Lu Ming to a pulp or even kill him on the spot. They did not expect that the outcome would be the complete opposite of what they had expected.</p><p>“To the law enforcement Hall!”</p><p>Xie Zhen brought Shi Zheng and hurried to the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest brought Wu Cang and the rest back to the law enforcement Hall, the remaining law enforcement soldiers were stunned. Then, their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Lu Ming had actually suppressed the disciples of the heaven martial sword faction and even Wu Cang. This was a huge blow to the heavens. How were they going to deal with the elders of the heaven martial sword faction who would go crazy in the future?</p><p>“We’re the law enforcement Army, enforcing the law on behalf of the sage Emperor. What are we afraid of? Follow my arrangements and get to work!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and then instructed tie Xing and the rest.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he threw Wu Cang and the others on the ground in a row. He took out an armchair and sat there, closing his eyes to rest.</p><p>The onlookers looked at each other. This commander of the law enforcement Army was really bold. At this moment, he was actually so leisurely sitting on the armchair with his eyes closed.</p><p>The sky above the law enforcement Hall was filled with people, and as time passed, more and more people appeared.</p><p>This time, it was different from the previous time. This time, it was against the heavenly martial sword faction. Furthermore, a second-grade heaven’s favorite had been suppressed. This caused a huge commotion, and many people were shocked and rushed over to watch.</p><p>Xie Zhen and Shi Zheng had arrived.</p><p>There were even second-grade heaven’s favorites from other Overlord forces. Everyone saw Jing kongling, Kong Xin, and goddess Tan Xiang.</p><p>There were also Xue Luo Zi, Yin BUPO, and so on. There were at least seven to eight people.</p><p>The elites were shocked to see Lu Ming sitting on the armchair with his eyes closed.</p><p>Wu Cang was as famous as they were, but this unassuming commander of the law enforcement Army was so powerful that he could suppress Wu Cang. This shocked them.</p><p>the royal family of the ancient Saint dynasty is indeed powerful. Even a commander of the law enforcement Army is so powerful!</p><p>Some people thought to themselves.</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrifying pressure descended from the sky. Everyone felt as if a mountain was pressing down on their bodies. There was a Qi activity that let out a terrifying roar. Under the pressure, the crowd took the initiative to open up a path. Three old men stepped through the air with gloomy expressions.</p><p>These three elders were all dressed in white robes and carried ancient swords on their backs. Their bodies seemed to be filled with endless sword Qi, and just their auras were extremely shocking.</p><p>It’s here!</p><p>Everyone’s heart trembled.</p><p>The elders of the heavenly martial sword faction were on the move.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming also opened his eyes and looked at the sky.</p><p>The three powerhouses of the heavenly martial sword faction flew over and finally stopped in the sky above the law enforcement Hall.</p><p>“Bastard, you’re finished. You’re dead. Haha, you’re dead!”</p><p>Wu Cang saw the arrival of the three old men and cried out in joy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming got up and stomped on Wu Cang’s face, causing his face to smash heavily on the ground. He took a bite of the soil and struggled madly with his limbs. He was so aggrieved that he was about to explode.</p><p>The onlookers shuddered in their hearts. Lu Ming actually dared to do this in the face of three seniors from the heavenly martial sword faction. He was simply lawless.</p><p>The three elders ‘gazes were as sharp as swords as they landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>An old man shouted angrily, his eyes extremely gloomy as he rebuked, ” “Kid, do you know who you’ve captured?”</p><p>“Aren’t they just a few pieces of trash from the heavenly martial sword faction? Why? Do you think it’s a glorious thing to raise a few pieces of trash?”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips and said casually.</p><p>He appeared to be very calm, as if he didn’t care about the elders of the heavenly martial sword sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
