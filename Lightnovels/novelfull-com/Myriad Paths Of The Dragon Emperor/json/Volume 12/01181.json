He’s Lu Ming?”</p><p>...</p><p>so, this person is Lu Ming, the one who defeated the paragons in the central continent’s holy city!</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s words shocked everyone from the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>Back then, in the battle of the million-year sacrificial ceremony in the ancient Saint dynasty, Lu Ming had defeated the prodigies of the big shots in succession. His name had long shaken the divine wilderness continent, and he was regarded as a peerless genius, second only to Long Chen.</p><p>He did not expect to see Lu Ming here.</p><p>At this moment, not only qu Luo, Mo Ye and the rest, but even the people from the hundred beasts tribe were curious. They did not know why Lu Ming had stopped qu Luo.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the hundred beasts tribe and finally landed on the Barbarian Emperor. He said in a clear voice,”The hundred beasts tribe has a long history. Wouldn’t it be a pity if it was destroyed? Barbarian Emperor, why don’t I make a bet with you?”</p><p>Bet?</p><p>Many people were surprised.</p><p>Bet? How to bet?</p><p>“You want to bet with me? Bet on what? How do we bet?”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor asked.</p><p>“Let’s bet on the problem between us and the hundred beasts tribe. If I win, the hundred beasts tribe must surrender unconditionally. If I lose, I’ll take my men and leave, never stepping foot in the hundred beasts tribe’s territory again!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>These words made everyone’s heart tremble.</p><p>This was a huge gamble, a gamble on the fate of the hundred beasts tribe.</p><p>“How should we bet?”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor asked again.</p><p>it’s simple. Tuoba Shi is a peerless heaven’s pride expert with unparalleled combat strength. This bet is on me and Tuoba Shi’s battle …</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s not bet on this. I know your combat strength is high and I’m not your match!”</p><p>Before Lu Ming could finish, Tuoba Shi interrupted him.</p><p>that’s right, Lu Ming. I can tell that your cultivation has reached the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. Tuoba Shi is no match for you!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor said.</p><p>The hundred beasts tribe and Tuoba Shi were shocked by his words.</p><p>This was especially so for Tuoba Shi. He was very clear that back in the holy city, Lu Ming was only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. It had only been a short while, but Lu Ming had already entered the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. This was too terrifying and abnormal.</p><p>you two, let me finish. What I mean is that in my battle with Tuoba Shi, I will suppress my realm to the same level as him. Tuoba Shi’s current cultivation should be at the peak of the third level of the spiritual God Realm, so I will also suppress my realm to the third level of the spiritual God Realm. Moreover, the bet is only one move. I will defeat Tuoba Shi in one move. If I can’t defeat Tuoba Shi in one move, I will lose this battle!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by his words.</p><p>Defeating Tuoba Shi in one move at the same cultivation level? How was that possible?</p><p>“What? You suppressed your realm to the third level of the spiritual God Realm and defeated me with one move?”</p><p>Tuoba Shi widened his eyes and glared at Lu Ming with a look of Fury.</p><p>This was an insult, an insult to him.</p><p>“That’s right. Tuoba Shi, do you dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare? Lu Ming, I promise to fight you. No one at the same level as me can defeat me in one move!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi strode forward, his eyes filled with rage as he glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>That’s right. Tuo BA Shi did not believe that anyone in the world could defeat him in one move. It was impossible.</p><p>Long Chen was able to defeat him in one move during the battle of the holy city because Long Chen’s realm was higher than his. At that time, Tuoba Shi had just reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm, while long Chen was definitely at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, or even stronger.</p><p>He was also very clear about Lu Ming’s combat strength.</p><p>When Lu Ming fought with Dark Child back then, it was rather difficult. He had to fight many moves before he could defeat Dark Child.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s combat strength wasn’t any weaker than yang potian’S. Yang potian was ranked third among the five overlords of central continent. Even if he was weaker than Dark Child, he was only a little weaker.</p><p>And now, tuo BA Shi was even stronger. Furthermore, he had recently achieved a breakthrough in one of his secret skills, which was more towards defense.</p><p>Tuoba Shi had always been inclined towards defense. Even yang potian’s spatial intent couldn’t break through his defense. Now that his defense was even stronger, his confidence had increased greatly, and he thought that he could suppress yang potian.</p><p>Therefore, he was not afraid of Lu Ming when they were at the same level.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually said that he would defeat him in one move. This was an insult to him and it made him furious.</p><p>“Patriarch, let him fight me. We’ll bet on this. I’ll make them withdraw their troops!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi looked at the Barbarian Emperor.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor frowned slightly. He felt that Lu Ming was a mystery.</p><p>However, he had the same thoughts as Tuoba Shi.</p><p>In the history of the hundred beasts tribe, tuo BA Shi’s talent was extremely rare. He was much stronger than when he was young. He did not believe that Lu Ming could defeat tuo BA Shi in one move when they were at the same level.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll bet with you on this battle!”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor said after a moment of silence.</p><p>“Alright, barbarian Emperor, let’s make a blood oath. After all, this is a matter of great importance. It would be bad if one of us reneges later!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“But I want to know if you can make the decision. If you agree and they go back on their word, what then?”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor looked at qu Luo and Mo Ye.</p><p>“I am the Supreme Commander. I have full authority to make decisions now!” Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor and the others were shocked by his words.</p><p>Lu Ming was actually the Supreme Commander, leading a large Army, including the Emperor. It was somewhat unbelievable.</p><p>“Commander, please reconsider!”</p><p>Qu Luo, Mo Ye, and the others spoke to Lu Ming telepathically.</p><p>They had heard of Tuoba Shi’s name before. It was hard for them to believe that Lu Ming could defeat Tuoba Shi in one move when they were at the same level.</p><p>“No need to say anything, I have my own plans!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and interrupted qu Luo and the rest.</p><p>Seeing this, the Barbarian Emperor set his mind at ease and took a blood oath with Lu Ming.</p><p>If Lu Ming was defeated, they would retreat. If Lu Ming won, the hundred beasts tribe would surrender unconditionally.</p><p>“Patriarch, what if Lu Ming really wins?”</p><p>A Supreme-being from the hundred beasts tribe sent a worried message to the Barbarian Emperor.</p><p>I’ve also considered this matter. Now that the world is in chaos, all the major forces are at war with each other. No force can stay out of it and will be implicated. The war will come sooner or later. If it’s not handled well, there will be a disaster of extermination!</p><p>if Lu Ming can really defeat Tuoba Shi in one move, it will prove that he is extremely talented. His future will be limitless. If he doesn’t die, it’s very possible that he will dominate the divine wilderness in the future. It might not be a bad choice for us to join him!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor secretly transmitted his thoughts to the Supreme-being.</p><p>As the Barbarian Emperor, he had lived for a long time. Naturally, he would not agree to the bet with Lu Ming just because of a moment of rashness. He had considered it carefully.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming had already considered this. His current cultivation level was still weak. If he only relied on his cultivation level, it would be impossible for him to intimidate the others. Therefore, he had to show his advantage.</p><p>His advantage was his talent and his age. He was still young and was at the Golden stage of a martial artist. His future was limitless.</p><p>Only by displaying his amazing talent would these big shots be intimidated and be willing to join him.</p><p>Just like how Xie Luan had formed an alliance with him, it was also because of this that he valued him.</p><p>“Lu Ming, let’s fight!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi stepped forward and stood in front of Lu Ming. A huge Mace appeared in his hand, and his aura rose like an enraged savage beast. He glared at Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
