Wu chengkong screamed and smashed his body on the platform. His head hit the platform like an iron hammer.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s head was buzzing. He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, a heart-piercing pain came from his left leg, which woke him up.</p><p>“My leg!”</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on one of his legs, completely breaking the bones.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped on his right leg and broke it.</p><p>Wu chengkong screamed and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Didn’t you just say that you were going to break my limbs and all my bones? Since that’s the case, why don’t you try it yourself!”</p><p>break! Lu Ming shouted. A long spear was condensed in his hand. He swept it across Wu chengkong’s arms, breaking the bones in his arms.</p><p>This was not an ordinary breaking of bones. It contained Lu Ming’s terrifying vital essence. The vibration of the vital essence shattered the bones in Wu chengkong’s entire arm. Even with Wu chengkong’s powerful cultivation and physical strength, he would need at least a few months to recover.</p><p>In the stands, the higher-ups of the heavenly martial Sword School had unsightly expressions on their faces.</p><p>Some people could not wait to rush forward and cut Lu Ming into eight pieces. However, in such an occasion, they could only endure it.</p><p>that’s f * cking unpleasant to hear. It’s like a pig being slaughtered. Get lost!</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming gave Wu chengkong a kick, sending him flying off the platform.</p><p>Of course, the last kick had shattered Wu chengkong’s bones. It would take him at least half a year to recover.</p><p>Geniuses fought against each other. Wu chengkong would probably be caught up or even surpassed by other geniuses in the same realm within half a year.</p><p>A disciple of the sky martial sword faction flew out and caught Wu chengkong. He was carried to the stands, and an elder of the sky martial sword faction fed him a healing pill.</p><p>“That little thief is so ruthless!”</p><p>The elder of the heavenly martial sword faction gritted his teeth in hatred.</p><p>Lu Ming was too ruthless. He had really shattered Wu chengkong’s bones and armor. Not a single piece was intact.</p><p>It was really difficult to recover in a short time.</p><p>At this moment, the battle on the platform was even more intense.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated Wu chengkong, and Shi du and Kong Lin were about to win.</p><p>One of the six second-grade heaven’s favorites had already been knocked off the platform.</p><p>“That good-for-nothing!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Shi du shouted when he saw Wu chengkong being defeated. Then, he howled and his body glowed with golden light. The next moment, Shi du transformed into his true form.</p><p>It was a Golden Lion that was five meters tall and more than ten meters long. It was covered in golden fur, and there were even golden flames dancing on its fur.</p><p>The sun Divine Lion!</p><p>The lion Capital possessed 90% of the sun Divine lion’s bloodline and was on the verge of becoming a pure-blooded sun Divine Lion.</p><p>As long as he could break through to the Emperor realm and undergo a transformation, he would become a true sun Divine Lion.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Even the lion roared loudly. He was even more terrifying in his true form. His roar shook the world and the clouds in the sky were scattered.</p><p>The huge claw slapped out and a second-grade heaven’s favorite was sent flying off the platform, blood spurting out of his mouth.</p><p>The difference was too great, and he was seriously injured in one move.</p><p>The second-grade heaven’s pride experts who were able to enter the top 20 were the strongest among the second-grade heaven’s pride experts. However, they were still no match for Shi du.</p><p>Roar! Even the lion roared. Golden flames were boiling, and his combat strength was violent. He continued to burst out, and another two geniuses were sent flying.</p><p>The remaining two were sent flying by Kong Lin’s two slaps.</p><p>The six second-grade heaven’s favorites were all defeated. Including Wu chengkong, who was kicked away by Lu Ming, there were a total of seven people who were defeated. There were only 13 people left on the platform.</p><p>As long as he could take down three more people, the top ten would be born.</p><p>Even the lion’s cold gaze landed on Lu Ming first.</p><p>On the other side, Kong Lin’s gaze first swept across goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling, then landed on the Emperor God.</p><p>Lion Capital, I’ll take care of this Emperor God and you’ll take care of Ming Lu. How about one for each of us? ”</p><p>Kong Lin said.</p><p>“This is just what I want!”</p><p>Shi du said.</p><p>And at this time, Kong Lin’s gaze landed on fairy Tan Xiang and Jing kongling again, and he said with a smile, ” goddess Tan Xiang, after we take care of the divine Emperor and Ming Lu, there will only be eleven people left on the stage. At that time, miss Kong Ling will have to go down. In this way, you can also enter the top ten!</p><p>Kong Lin was a suitor of fairy Tan Xiang. At this time, he naturally had to seize the opportunity to court her favor.</p><p>“Oh, really? Was young master Kong that confident? Don’t be unable to do it, okay?”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang narrowed her eyes and smiled.</p><p>“Hahaha, you can’t do it? Other than the heaven’s favorites of the big shots, no one can escape from my hands!”</p><p>Kong Lin smiled and moved suddenly. With a flash of five-colored light, he pounced toward the Emperor God at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Kong Lin’s true form was a type of Peacock. He had 90% of the bloodline of the five elements Peacock, and his speed was unparalleled in the world.</p><p>However, he had encountered an Emperor God.</p><p>Spatial intent, the king of intents, was also skilled in speed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The Emperor God didn’t fight with Kong Lin. Instead, he used instant step to avoid Kong Lin’s attack.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and the other escaping, were both shockingly fast, constantly flashing on the platform.</p><p>For a moment, it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>second level of the spiritual God Realm! The Emperor God has also broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>Someone exclaimed as he saw the cultivation of the Emperor God.</p><p>there’s finally a decent heaven’s favorite in the East continent. Although he’s not as good as the big shots, he’s one of the best among the second-grade heaven’s favorites!</p><p>Someone commented.</p><p>The Emperor God had comprehended the space will and his cultivation had broken through the second level of the spiritual God Realm. He was already at the peak of the second-class heaven’s favorites. Wu chengkong might not be his match.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The lion roared and pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>The Golden Claw radiance was like a golden heavenly blade that tore the space apart.</p><p>“Dragon power!”</p><p>With a single thought, the seven dragon energies in his body instantly exploded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body glowed with purple light. However, there were no scales on his body. Therefore, the Masters of the Wang and Jiang families could not recognize him.</p><p>The Dragon power burst forth, and Lu Ming’s strength was even more shocking. At the same time, a five-colored will spread out as he threw a punch.</p><p>At this moment, everyone was shocked.</p><p>this Minglu actually wants to fight against Lion City head-on. He’s overestimating himself!</p><p>that’s right. His combat strength is indeed very strong, but there’s still a big gap between him and the heaven’s favorites. It’s not wise to fight him head-on!</p><p>Many people had thought that Lu Ming would learn from the Emperor God and use all his strength to Dodge and stall for time. As long as the Western Desert and Southern nether, or yang potian and Tuoba Shi had a winner, he would be able to enter the top ten.</p><p>He had never expected that Lu Ming would choose to fight against Lion City head-on.</p><p>Wasn’t it courting death to fight against a powerful heaven’s favorite head-on?</p><p>five-colored will! This person has comprehended five types of will!</p><p>In the stands, the Masters of the Wang and Jiang families were shocked.</p><p>Previously, they had seen Lu Ming comprehend four types of concepts. That was the highest number of concepts that they had ever seen someone comprehend. However, they were surprised to see that someone had comprehended five concepts.</p><p>They did not think of Lu Ming as the better option.</p><p>First, they had clearly seen Lu Ming outside the talisman Amulet sect. It was impossible for him to be in the central continent.</p><p>Secondly, Lu Ming had only comprehended four concepts during the battle of Providence. At such a high cultivation level, it was impossible for him to continue to comprehend new concepts. It was too difficult.</p><p>They could only sigh, central continent was indeed full of geniuses, there was actually someone who could comprehend five intents.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
