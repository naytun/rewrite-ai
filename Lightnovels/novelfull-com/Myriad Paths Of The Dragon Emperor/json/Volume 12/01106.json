Was this what a second-grade heaven’s favorite was? The power was too terrifying.</p><p>...</p><p>Many people retreated in a frenzy, afraid of being touched by Wu Cang’s sword. A heaven’s pride expert like him could kill experts of the same level with his sword’s sharpness alone.</p><p>“This commander is dead for sure!”</p><p>Seeing Wu Cang’s power, many people sighed.</p><p>Wu Cang was so powerful. What could Lu Ming use to block him?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>die! Wu Cang shouted coldly. His palm was like a sword. Light burst forth and formed a dazzling sword ray that slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>As the sword radiance slashed, even the space was torn apart, revealing a terrifying, pitch-black spatial Rift.</p><p>“This … Not good, quickly Dodge!”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, tie Xing and the rest were terrified. Faced with such a powerful sword, they felt that it was impossible to resist. If they resisted, they would only die.</p><p>They shouted and wanted to retreat, but they found that their bodies were covered by a terrifying sword power, and they couldn’t move.</p><p>it’s over, it’s over. I’ve finally been killed by this unreliable commander!</p><p>A thought flashed through the minds of tie Xing and the others.</p><p>However, at this moment, they saw a long spear condensed in Lu Ming’s hands. The long spear shook and hummed. Even the space trembled. At this moment, tie Xing and the others realized that the sword power that enveloped them had disappeared. They had regained their freedom.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, they saw Lu Ming holding a long spear and sweeping it out.</p><p>This spear was like a long spear sweeping across the surface of water. This was because wherever the long spear passed, layers of ripples would appear in the space. Moreover, these ripples would all gather on the long spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear and the sword radiance collided. Only a soft sound was heard before Wu Cang’s sword radiance was destroyed.</p><p>He blocked it?</p><p>Tie Xing and the others were stunned.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers were also stunned.</p><p>This awesome commander could actually block Wu Cang’s move?</p><p>When did a commander of the law enforcement Army become so powerful?</p><p>A bunch of questions flashed through everyone’s mind.</p><p>Wu Cang was also stunned. Apparently, he did not expect that a law enforcement soldier could block his attack. Although he did not use his full strength, he still felt embarrassed.</p><p>Who was he? A second-grade heaven’s favorite whose name shook the central continent, an existence second only to the top five young men, couldn’t take down a mere commander of the law enforcement Army with one move?</p><p>This made him burst out with even stronger and burning killing intent.</p><p>good, very good. You do have some ability. But today, your end is already decided!</p><p>die! Wu Cang shouted coldly. The sword Qi around his body became even hotter. Vital essence gushed out continuously and finally turned into a sword Qi that was several times more terrifying than before. It slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming still swept out his spear casually and destroyed Wu Cang’s sword aura, turning it into nothing.</p><p>“Show me your true ability, or it won’t be enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Wu Cang from the corner of his eyes.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wu Cang shouted and unsheathed his sword. The sword radiance was so bright that it seemed like it was going to split the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Wu Cang wielded his combat sword with terrifying might. As he slashed out with his combat sword, the space around him shattered.</p><p>heavens, he’s too strong. Wu Cang is furious. He’s too terrifying. Retreat! Retreat!</p><p>Many people shouted and retreated madly again.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear in one hand. The long spear in his hand slashed violently and turned into a thousand meters long. It swept out in a brutal manner.</p><p>With a bang, Wu Cang’s sword aura was shattered again. However, this time, Lu Ming did not stop. The terrifying giant spear continued to press down on Wu Cang.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>impossible! Wu Cang shouted in disbelief. He had already performed a divine level martial arts technique, but he was still defeated by Lu Ming’s spear. How was this possible? he could not believe it.</p><p>What he could not stand the most was that he felt a strong sense of danger when Lu Ming swept his spear at him.</p><p>How could a mere law enforcement Army, which was as insignificant as an ant, have such a powerful expert?</p><p>“Burst, burst!”</p><p>die! he roared in his heart and activated his divine bloodline. He merged his bloodline and turned it into a sword with shocking sword Qi.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped into the air. His long spear contained the power of the prison-suppressing heaven technique. He changed the momentum of the spear and smashed it down at Wu Cang.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The long spear hit the combat sword that Wu Cang had transformed into. The attack launched by the combat sword was instantly destroyed. The combat sword shook violently and finally exploded with a bang.</p><p>The combat sword exploded, revealing Wu Cang’s body. His face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p>Wu Cang was defeated. Wu Cang was actually defeated by Lu Ming’s spear. How was this possible? what was going on?</p><p>Was he still a commander of the law enforcement Army? How could he be so powerful?</p><p>Those who had thought that Lu Ming was dead for sure almost bit off their tongues and glared at him until their eyes burst. It was too unbelievable.</p><p>As for Shi Fang, he thought he was dreaming.</p><p>Wasn’t Minglu only at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm? Wasn’t he just a disciple of the black spear sect? How could he be so strong?</p><p>His body trembled in disbelief.</p><p>As for tie Xing and the others, they were completely petrified.</p><p>The three disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction were also petrified, staring at the sky in a daze.</p><p>how weak. I was wondering how strong a second-grade heaven’s favorite of the heavenly Sword faction would be.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips, his face full of disdain.</p><p>Wu Cang was furious. He was so furious that he wanted to roar at the sky.</p><p>In the past, he was terrifyingly talented and powerful. In the heavenly Sword faction, only Wu chengkong could beat him.</p><p>Even in the battle of karmic luck, he had not lost too badly.</p><p>But recently, he was first killed by Lu Shaoqing in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. If not for the life talisman, he would not have been able to keep his life.</p><p>Now, he was actually defeated by a mere commander of the law enforcement Army. This was a great humiliation. From now on, his name, Wu Cang, would become a laughing stock and his reputation would be greatly reduced.</p><p>How could he not be angry and hate her?</p><p>If he knew that Lu Shaoqing and the commander of the law enforcement Army were the same person, what would he think?</p><p>“Bastard, just you wait! You’re dead!”</p><p>Wu Cang roared and retreated.</p><p>“Since you’re here, where do you want to go? Have a good rest with your junior brothers!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His body was like a stream of light and he rushed in front of Wu Cang in a few moments.</p><p>“Don’t you dare!”</p><p>Wu Cang roared.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to suppress him and let him lie there like the other disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction? How dare he?</p><p>He was the second heaven’s pride expert of the heavenly Sword faction. He was completely different from the other heaven’s pride experts.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were cold as he stepped in the air. The power of the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps burst out. He took seven consecutive steps toward Wu Cang.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Wu Cang’s body trembled violently. He was injured and could not withstand the impact. His body shook violently and blood spurted out of his mouth. In the end, Lu Ming stepped on his face. He screamed and fell to the ground. He came into close contact with the ground and created a human-shaped pit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
