Everyone heard it, including the many emperors. Lu Ming had directly used the emperors to suppress the red-robed young man and then attacked him. It would not be good for cold-blood Hall to stand up for the red-robed young man.</p><p>...</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>it’s indeed interesting. You’re very bold!</p><p>Around the platform, some sovereigns spoke indifferently and looked at Lu Ming with interest.</p><p>what a good appetite. He doesn’t eat exotic food, but likes to eat dirt. This is the first time I’ve seen this!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself. He stepped into the air again and went to the main entrance.</p><p>His words almost made the cold-blood Hall people vomit blood.</p><p>Liu Yuxin gritted her teeth and glared at Lu Ming with an ugly expression.</p><p>The other young men beside Liu Yuxin looked at Lu Ming with fear.</p><p>The red-robed young man could not fight back at all in Lu Ming’s hands, which shocked them.</p><p>“Little girl, why are you staring at me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across Liu Yuxin’s body. Then, he laughed and walked through the door.</p><p>Liu Yuxin’s eyes were red.</p><p>She swore in her heart that if there was a chance, she would definitely make Lu Ming regret it.</p><p>Lu Ming walked past the main door and came to the front of the 18 roads. Some of the elites sized him up curiously.</p><p>They were all very curious. When did such a heaven’s favorite appear?</p><p>Slowly, more and more people crossed the gate and arrived in front of the 18 paths. In the end, there were no less than 500 people, all of whom were top heaven’s favorites.</p><p>alright, let’s begin. Remember, if you fly out or fall down this path, you’ll fail!</p><p>Xie Qitian’s voice was heard.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Immediately, there were people who rushed up. There was one person on each road.</p><p>When they rushed onto the path formed by the rainbow light, a figure appeared on the road and attacked the heaven’s favorites on the road.</p><p>The palm print blasted out, and on the 18 paths, the 18 young men all roared angrily and were sent flying out of the range of the rainbow light path.</p><p>Failed!</p><p>In an instant, all 18 young men had failed.</p><p>that’s the strength of the spiritual God! It’s actually the strength of the spiritual God!</p><p>there’s a spiritual God blocking the way. How can we rush over? this is too difficult!</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed and became very ugly.</p><p>There was actually a spirit God blocking the way. How could those youths in the spirit embryo realm possibly charge past?</p><p>it seems that the screening part will eliminate many people!</p><p>that’s true. With the spiritual God in the way, how many people can break through? ”</p><p>“That’s normal. The sage Emperor also said that only the top ten can enter the sage Emperor’s ancient palace. What can those spirit embryo realm prodigies do if they rush over? It’s just to make up the numbers, so it’s better to be eliminated earlier!”</p><p>Many people in the surroundings were in a heated discussion.</p><p>On every path of rainbow light, there was a figure standing with his hands behind his back. Although they weren’t real, they still gave off a powerful aura.</p><p>“As long as I rush over, I might have a chance!” He thought.</p><p>Someone’s eyes flickered as he began to plan.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, another 18 people rushed up.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The 18 of them struck out with their palms at the same time. The power of their palms was like a stormy sea, continuous and endless.</p><p>17 of them were directly sent flying by the palm force and were eliminated.</p><p>However, there was one person who was a third-class heaven’s favorite. Moreover, he was a powerful figure among third-class heaven’s favorites. His cultivation was infinitely close to that of a spiritual God. He took the palm strike head-on but was not sent flying. Instead, he seized the opportunity and aimed at an opening. He used a powerful movement technique and rushed over.</p><p>He rushed past the figure’s obstruction.</p><p>haha, I’ve made it! I’ve succeeded!</p><p>The young man was ecstatic and ran forward. However, before he could feel happy, three more figures formed in front of him. Each of the three figures was at the first level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Three powerful palm forces rushed toward the young man.</p><p>“You can’t play like this …”</p><p>The young man shouted and was sent flying by the powerful palm force.</p><p>three spiritual gods, three spiritual gods, how are we going to pass this!</p><p>Many people sighed. It was already very difficult to pass even one, and now, there were three more on the road ahead. How could they possibly pass?</p><p>“It’s almost impossible to pass without reaching the spiritual God stage!”</p><p>Someone shook his head.</p><p>However, there were still people who didn’t give up and wanted to try.</p><p>The facts proved that every path was the same. At the start, there was a first level spiritual God Realm figure, and behind it, there were three first level spiritual God Realm figures.</p><p>Of course, the strength of these figures was considered ordinary among the first level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Many people failed!</p><p>Lu Ming saw that Blood Sword one, corpse warrior, Dongfang Yu of the Ditian divine Palace, ao tu and Feng Xuan of the heavenly demon Valley had all failed one by one.</p><p>Although their talents were considered top notch in the eastern wilderness, they were considered ordinary in the vast divine wilderness.</p><p>The first few batches of people did not succeed.</p><p>In the sixth batch, a second-grade heaven’s favorite made his move. This person was Lu Ming’s old acquaintance, blood Luo Zi.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi sent the first spiritual God flying with a single strike. He then charged forward and faced the three spiritual gods. However, it did not cause much trouble for Xue Luo Zi. He struck three times with his palms and forced the three spiritual gods back. Then, he charged forward.</p><p>What was shocking was that before blood Luo Zi reached the finish line, more figures appeared on the road. This time, there were nine figures.</p><p>Nine first level spiritual God Realm experts!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine figures struck out with their palms at the same time. The nine palms were connected, one after another, and the power of the palms was like an avalanche.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s face turned serious. Blood light burst out and condensed into a blood-red saber. He struck out continuously, breaking the nine palm forces one by one. However, after one palm strike, the nine figures struck out another palm. Nine palm prints gathered together again, erupting with terrible power.</p><p>The nine figures seemed to be connected to each other, and their cooperation was flawless.</p><p>With a shrill cry, Xue Luozi performed the bloodline fusion and turned into a blood-winged bat. It made a terrible sound wave and broke the palm force. Then, its wings were like heavenly blades, cutting a figure in half. It rushed through the gap and flew forward.</p><p>After passing through the nine figures, there were no more obstacles behind him. His journey was smooth, and blood Luo Zi became the first person to reach the platform.</p><p>Even so, it still made many people feel dejected.</p><p>The difficulty was too great. With nine first level spiritual God Realm existences joining forces, their powers stacked together and were too powerful. Apart from those who had broken through to the spiritual God Realm, who else below the spiritual God Realm could charge through?</p><p>However, among the younger generation, other than the second-grade geniuses, no one had broken through to the third-grade.</p><p>sigh, forget it. I don’t have any hope. The difference is too big!</p><p>Some people shook their heads and sighed, planning to give up.</p><p>indeed, there’s no need to. There’s no hope at all. There’s no need to humiliate yourself!</p><p>that’s right. This time, I’ll just be a spectator!</p><p>Many people spoke up and gave up.</p><p>“Hmph, what a waste of time!”</p><p>Hmph! at this moment, a cold snort sounded, and a young man stepped out.</p><p>This person was dressed in a black robe, his eyes were sinister, and his entire body was covered in black mist. He was abnormally cold, and the people standing beside him could not help but shiver.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
