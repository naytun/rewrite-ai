From the simple conversation between the two of them, it was not difficult to guess what had happened.</p><p>...</p><p>It must be the young woman and the others talking about what had happened in the Tianxia Academy and the secret realm of the Saint mansion.</p><p>In the secret realm of the Saint mansion, the two strongest heaven’s favorites of the previous generation of the heavenly martial sword sect were killed by Lu Ming. The two strongest heaven’s favorites of this generation were also killed by Lu Ming. They were lucky to survive because of the life talisman.</p><p>This matter had already spread far and wide, and Lu Shaoqing’s name had shaken the entire central continent.</p><p>The young woman must have been talking about this matter, and if the disciples of the heavenly martial sword sect heard it, they would naturally take action.</p><p>shut up! How dare you bring this up again? who knows what kind of despicable methods Lu Shaoqing used to harm the senior brothers of the heavenly martial sword sect? how dare you all spout nonsense here? you’re courting death!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A few disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction shouted, and their attacks became even more violent.</p><p>“Stop! The law enforcement Army is here!”</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the air and shouted.</p><p>The three disciples of the sky martial sword faction turned to look at Lu Ming, their eyes full of contempt.</p><p>“The heavenly martial sword sect is handling matters. Unrelated people, get lost!”</p><p>A disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction shouted coldly. He was extremely domineering. They didn’t even care about the law enforcement Army.</p><p>it’s that awesome commander of the law enforcement Army. Does he dare to touch the disciples of the heavenly Sword faction? ”</p><p>that’s impossible. No matter how powerful he is, he might be able to deal with a small force like the Huang family. However, this is the heavenly martial sword faction, a top Overlord force. Unless he has a death wish, he would never dare to touch a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction!</p><p>that’s right. Didn’t you see that the disciples of the heavenly Sword faction didn’t even care about him? ”</p><p>At that moment, many people in the crowd recognized Lu Ming. However, no one thought that he would dare to touch the disciples of the heaven martial sword faction.</p><p>A small law enforcement Army dared to touch a disciple of the heavenly Sword faction? Wasn’t that looking for death?</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The three heaven martial sword faction disciples ignored Lu Ming and attacked more and more fiercely. Their sword Qi was like a rainbow, and the seventh level spirit embryo realm elder was at a complete disadvantage. He couldn’t resist at all, and his chest was slashed by a sword light. A deep sword mark appeared, almost splitting him in half, and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Young lady, young master, leave quickly!”</p><p>The old man roared and exploded with all his might, trying to get the young man and woman to leave.</p><p>“Leave? Today, none of you will be able to leave. If you dare to spread rumors about my Heavenly Sword sect, you will all be killed!”</p><p>A disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction shouted coldly. His figure flashed, and like a sword light, he bypassed the old man and attacked the young woman.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The old man roared, but he couldn’t even save himself, so how could he help?</p><p>The young woman’s face was as white as snow. She was only at the first level of the spirit embryo realm, while the other party was at the fifth level of the spirit embryo realm. In addition, he was a heaven’s favorite with powerful combat strength. She couldn’t block him at all.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction had a ferocious look in his eyes. His sword light was like lightning as it slashed towards the young woman.</p><p>However, the sword light stopped halfway.</p><p>Because the wrist of the person holding the sword was caught, the sword of the heavenly martial Sword School disciple could no longer cut down.</p><p>The person who grabbed his wrist was naturally Lu Ming.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lu Ming appeared in front of the young woman and blocked the sword of the disciple of the sky martial Sword School.</p><p>When he saw that it was Lu Ming, the disciple’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. He shouted, how dare you, a mere law enforcement soldier, interfere with my attack? I’ll kill you as well!</p><p>With a burst of vital essence, the sword Qi from the disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction whistled. He pointed his fingers at Lu Ming’s throat like a sword.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked the disciple’s stomach. The disciple screamed and his body flew dozens of meters away. He fell heavily on the ground.</p><p>“You … You dare to fight back?”</p><p>The disciple of the sky martial sword faction shouted in disbelief. Lu Ming actually dared to hit him? He was a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming said faintly. This person wanted to kill him just now. Wasn’t it normal for him to retaliate? Could it be that this disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction was so superior that no one would dare to fight back when he killed them?</p><p>Was his head kicked by a donkey?</p><p>At this moment, the other two disciples of the heaven martial sword faction stopped their attacks and looked at Lu Ming in a daze.</p><p>A mere law enforcement Army, an ant-like thing, actually dared to beat up a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction? They had yet to recover from their shock.</p><p>The surrounding onlookers were also dumbfounded. After a long time, someone finally reacted.</p><p>WOWO, this awesome commander is really awesome. He even dared to beat up the disciples of the heavenly Sword faction!</p><p>that’s right. This is beyond my expectations. He’s too bold.</p><p>“He’s bold, but he’s brainless. How should he deal with the aftermath?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s action caused a wave of discussion as it really shocked everyone.</p><p>Previously, no one had thought that Lu Ming would dare to make a move. However, the truth was beyond their expectations.</p><p>“Brat, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, the other two disciples of the sky martial sword faction finally reacted. One of them shouted and became one with his sword, turning into a sharp sword light and charging toward Lu Ming, trying to kill him with one strike.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>However, he was met with Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>This kick was the same as the previous one, it landed on his stomach. Fast, accurate and ruthless, the disciple let out a blood-curdling scream and was sent flying far away. He fell beside the previous disciple and also fell flat on his face.</p><p>The two of them were in the same position.</p><p>The crowd gasped. Lu Ming was really audacious. If he had accidentally hit the disciple of the heaven martial sword faction just now, it was completely intentional. He was not afraid of the disciple at all.</p><p>In the crowd, the law enforcement soldiers who came with Lu Ming broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>They had caused a huge mess. They sighed in their hearts.</p><p>The remaining disciple of the sky martial sword faction was shocked. Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. With just a simple move, he had killed a fellow disciple who had a similar combat strength to him. He did not dare to make a move at all.</p><p>kid, how dare you hit the heaven’s favorite of the heavenly Sword faction? you’re dead! Not only you, but the force behind you and your family are all dead! They’ll all be annihilated! Just you wait! You’re just a mere law enforcement Army, you lowly thing! Just you wait!</p><p>The remaining disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction shouted ferociously, then turned around and wanted to leave.</p><p>“Did I let you go?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>The disciple of the sky martial sword faction froze. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”You … What do you mean by that?”</p><p>He was about to leave and Lu Ming still wanted to pursue the matter?</p><p>“Nonsense, you want to just walk away after killing someone in my territory? who do you think I am? What’s the law enforcement Army?”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and stepped forward.</p><p>“You … Don’t come over, I … I’m telling you, you’re dead!”</p><p>The remaining disciples of the sky martial sword faction shouted. However, when they saw Lu Ming approaching them, they were so frightened that they trembled all over and could not even speak properly.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming kicked him directly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
