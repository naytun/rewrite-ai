This person was considered average among the seven levels of the spiritual God Realm. If he had awakened a sixth level divine level or even a seventh level divine level bloodline, or if his low-grade divine level martial technique was a bit stronger, he would not be so easy to kill.</p><p>As soon as the man was killed by Lu Ming, the demonic Qi that Xie Luan had turned into flew over and wrapped him up. In just a few breaths, not even a residue was left of him.</p><p>Lu Ming secretly felt that it was a pity. If he had devoured a few seventh level spiritual God Realm martial artists, his cultivation would also be able to improve quickly.</p><p>However, the most important thing now was for Xie Lun to recover his strength. If he fully recovered, no, he didn’t need to fully recover. As long as he recovered to the realm of an ordinary Emperor, their safety would be guaranteed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, another expert is here. This time, it’s a perfected spiritual God expert. We can’t deal with him. Let’s find a place to hide first. I’ll come out after I’ve cultivated the nine seals of the divine Gate!”</p><p>Xie Luan said after sensing for a moment.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He turned to the South and used the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps. He turned into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming left, an extremely powerful presence appeared at the place where the battle had taken place. The person sensed it carefully and frowned as he muttered, Junior Brother Wan and the others ‘auras are here. However, judging from the remnant auras, they should have died. Lu Ming actually has such powerful means to kill a seventh level spiritual God Realm existence? ”</p><p>The man mumbled to himself before looking to the South. A fiery light flashed in his eyes as he chased after them.</p><p>Lu Ming flew more than a hundred thousand miles and saw a huge Lake. He rushed down with a long spear in his hand. The long spear spun and pierced through the soil and rocks at the bottom of the lake, rushing underground.</p><p>At the same time, under the influence of Lu Ming’s will of the earth, Lu Ming’s speed of penetrating the underground rocks was very fast. In just a short while, he was a hundred miles below the ground. At the same time, the rocks that he had passed through behind him regrouped as if no one had passed through them.</p><p>this heaven’s secrets instrument projection is really amazing. It can still be condensed even in the depths of the earth!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and looked at the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument above his head. He continued to rush underground.</p><p>After a few breaths, he traveled another hundred miles. With a thought, Lu Ming appeared in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>As soon as he entered the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming looked up and finally heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument above his head was finally cut off and did not appear again.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram was indeed a legendary treasure. It seemed to be of a higher level than the heaven’s secrets instrument of the Royal Xie family, as it had successfully blocked the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument.</p><p>Deep underground, only the mountain and river diagram was among the rocks.</p><p>About ten breaths after Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram, the being with the great circle of the spirit embryo realm also arrived above the lake.</p><p>However, at this moment, the array disc in the person’s hand dimmed and he had completely lost contact with Lu Ming.</p><p>“What’s going on? Why did the formation plate lose its connection to the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection? That shouldn’t be the case, the heaven’s secrets device is the most mysterious treasure of the Royal Xie family. Even if it’s hidden deep underground, it should still be able to sense it. Could it be that the Royal Xie family suddenly stopped operating the heaven’s secrets device?”</p><p>This person frowned and various thoughts appeared in his mind as he began to search the surroundings.</p><p>……</p><p>In the mountain and river diagram, Xie nianqing sat cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree, cultivating quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming came to Xie nianqing’s side.</p><p>the path-understanding ancient tree. You even have the path-understanding ancient tree? ”</p><p>Xie Luan’s figure appeared. He was shocked to see the three-leafed path-understanding ancient tree.</p><p>The mountain and river diagram and the ancient tree of comprehension were both legendary treasures. The fact that Lu Ming had both of them shocked the chaotic heavenly demon Emperor.</p><p>Although Xie Luan had been extremely powerful and famous, he had not possessed such a treasure.</p><p>“I obtained them in the battle of Providence!”</p><p>Lu Ming randomly came up with a reason.</p><p>What he said was half true and half false. The mountain and river diagram had indeed been obtained in the battle of Providence, but the path-understanding ancient tree had not. It had spurted out from the Heaven’s Gate.</p><p>you’re really lucky, kid. Many people have participated in the battle of Providence, including me, but I’ve never heard of anyone obtaining such a treasure!</p><p>Xie Luan said, his eyes still filled with surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and did not explain further.</p><p>alright, I’ll start to comprehend the nine seals of the divine Gate now. With the help of your path-understanding ancient tree, I’ll definitely be able to cultivate faster!</p><p>After Xie Luan finished speaking, he also sat cross-legged under the path-understanding tree.</p><p>Lu Ming also sat cross-legged at the side, quietly comprehending the concept.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan ended his cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it too. He ended his cultivation and said, ” “Senior, have you finished cultivating?”</p><p>Xie Luan nodded and said, ” I’ve succeeded in the initial stage, but it’ll take some time for me to master it. The nine seals of the gate of God is indeed mysterious. Let’s go out now. I’ll help you try it out!</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. With a thought, he exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>As soon as he got out of the mountain and river diagram, the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument condensed again above his head.</p><p>“Nine seals of the gate of God, seal!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s hands kept forming seals. In the next moment, sealing gates appeared around Lu Ming.</p><p>There were a total of four sealing gates, and they spread out in four directions. They appeared around the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection, and they gave off a resplendent light that enveloped the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>seal! Xie Luan shouted again, and the power of the seal burst forth. The four doors of light pressed down, and finally gathered together to form a single door of light. The projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument also disappeared.</p><p>“Hidden!”</p><p>Xie Luan shouted again, and the remaining door of light trembled and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly amazed. Xie Luan was indeed Xie Luan. He was a top-notch expert among martial emperors. His comprehension was too strong.</p><p>Back then, Lu Ming spent three days before he managed to cultivate it successfully and form a sealing door.</p><p>Xie Luan, on the other hand, had only spent three days to condense four sealing gates, and he had used them more skillfully than Lu Ming.</p><p>The higher one’s realm was, the deeper one’s understanding of martial Dao would be, and the faster one could cultivate secret skills and martial techniques.</p><p>“Lu Ming, with my current cultivation level, I can only help you seal the door for three hours. After three hours, the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection will break through the seal. At that time, we will need to re-seal it!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“Three hours is enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. His appearance began to change. Even his aura changed. He then rushed to the ground.</p><p>…..</p><p>Within a certain range of Lu Ming, many experts were looking for him.</p><p>As there was news that Lu Ming had appeared here, it naturally attracted many experts.</p><p>Not only were there experts from the heavenly martial Sword School, but there were also experts from the royal family, the Xie family, and even experts from other forces such as cold-blood Hall and Sky Eagle Castle who had come from hundreds of millions of miles away.</p><p>In the past three days, many experts had ransacked the place but they did not find any traces of Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
