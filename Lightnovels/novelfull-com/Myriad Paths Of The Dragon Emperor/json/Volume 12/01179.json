He took a step forward and charged towards the pangolin sect powerhouse.</p><p>This person had a cultivation of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, he did not even last two moves before his defense was broken by Lu Ming and his heart was pierced.</p><p>A one-shot kill!</p><p>After killing this person, Lu Ming continued to look for a target to devour.</p><p>The battle was extremely intense. The experts of the mountain piercing sect fell like raindrops.</p><p>As Lu Ming devoured, he kept the storage ring.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming had devoured the essence of heaven and earth from dozens of spiritual God Realm powerhouses.</p><p>it’s enough, it’s enough. Spirit God experts all have very strong self-consciousness. If I absorb too much, even after refining it, it will be very impure and affect my Foundation. I need time to Polish it!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he retreated to the outside of the battlefield, back to the warship.</p><p>Xie nianqing wasn’t on the warship. He was fighting outside to train himself.</p><p>Lu Ming asked Meng Chong and jiang ke to protect Xie nianqing in secret in case anything happened to him.</p><p>Lu Ming stood on the warship, refining the concept runes that he had devoured while observing the situation of the battle.</p><p>In the sky, the myriad mountain Emperor was completely suppressed by qu Luo and Mo Ye. He was already injured and his defeat was set in stone.</p><p>It was the same for the battlefields below the Emperor level. The mountain piercing sect was powerless to turn the situation around.</p><p>“Wanshan, just surrender. Don’t make any pointless struggles!”</p><p>Qu Luo said coldly.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. Unless you kill me today, don’t even think about having a good time!”</p><p>Emperor of myriad mountains roared with a cold killing intent.</p><p>He began to charge, planning to escape.</p><p>As long as he escaped, he would definitely take revenge in the future. The revenge of an Emperor was terrifying. As long as the Emperor was not here, no one would be his opponent.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you today!”</p><p>Qu Luo revealed a strong killing intent, and so did Mo Ye. They used all their strength, determined to kill Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, a fiery red light bloomed from below, and the surrounding temperature rose sharply.</p><p>While Yan kuangtu was fighting the three great Supremes, the Emperor spirit tower emerged above his head. It trembled slightly and a Ring of Fire domain spread out.</p><p>The three Supreme-beings of the pangolin sect were hit by the Imperial spirit tower’s territory. Their faces turned pale as they spat out mouthfuls of blood and were sent flying.</p><p>“An Emperor spiritual weapon!”</p><p>One of the Supreme-beings shouted in shock.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yan kuangtu took out his Emperor spirit tower, and his combat strength was raised to a terrifying level. He stepped forward, and his Emperor spirit tower enlarged, suppressing one of the Supreme-beings.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Supreme-being was locked down by the power of the Emperor spirit tower and could not escape. He could only resist passively.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Supreme-being was completely defenseless under the suppression of the Emperor spirit tower. He was torn into pieces and died on the spot.</p><p>After killing one Supreme-being, Yan kuangtu moved on to kill another Supreme-being.</p><p>The remaining two Supreme-beings ‘expressions changed drastically. They didn’t dare to fight and retreated frantically.</p><p>Yan kuangtu stared at one of them and chased after him. Finally, he caught up and killed him.</p><p>“Blood essence of a Supreme Being!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved again. He rushed toward the Supreme-being’s corpse to collect the blood essence.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t going to let go of the Supreme Being’s storage ring either. He planned to give it to Yan kuangtu after he kept it.</p><p>Lu Ming had collected the blood essence of the two Supreme-beings killed by Yan kuangtu. He had also collected the blood essence of the other Supreme-being who had been killed by others.</p><p>As Lu Ming was the commander, the people on his side naturally would not stop him. As for the pangolin sect, they were busy with their own affairs. Naturally, no one stopped Lu Ming.</p><p>“Devouring a portion of true Yuan energy!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the devouring power and devoured the vital essence energy of a few eighth and ninth level spiritual God Realm experts. Then, he returned to the warship and continued to refine.</p><p>His intent realm was improving, so his cultivation base could naturally improve as well.</p><p>As the energy continued to be refined and transformed into essential core, Lu Ming began to break through to the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>His true Qi was boiling and surging, causing thousands of waves as it continuously attacked the bottleneck.</p><p>At this moment, the battle between the emperors in the sky was even more intense.</p><p>The myriad mountain sovereign tried his best to escape, but he was attacked with all his might by qu Luo and Mo Ye. At this moment, the myriad mountain sovereign was already severely injured. His body was almost split open, and he was covered in blood, making him look like a blood man.</p><p>“You can’t kill me! Explode!”</p><p>The Wanshan Emperor’s eyes were filled with madness. His Wanshan territory burst forth, and his spirit body glowed. With a loud roar, his body was really about to split apart. At the same time, his territory exploded crazily, and a terrifying power swept towards quluo and Mo Ye.</p><p>“This lunatic!”</p><p>Quluo and Mo Ye roared in anger. The myriad mountain Emperor was using a self-mutilating method to block them, trying to buy himself a chance to escape.</p><p>It was too difficult to kill an Emperor who was trying to escape.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After blocking qu Luo and Mo Ye, the Wanshan Emperor took this opportunity to escape.</p><p>However, at this moment, a fiery red giant Pagoda shot out from the sky and suppressed Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>It was Yan kuangtu. At the critical moment, he rushed over with the Emperor spirit tower and attacked Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s an Emperor weapon!”</p><p>die! Emperor Wanshan roared and struck out with both hands, hitting the Emperor spirit tower. The tower shook violently, and Yan kuangtu was forced to retreat.</p><p>But in the end, he still managed to block Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>Yan kuangtu’s cultivation was already extremely close to the martial Royal realm. With the addition of his King spiritual weapon, his combat strength could barely contend with a King.</p><p>With this short delay, qu Luo and Mo Ye had already arrived.</p><p>“Wanshan, your fate has already been decided!”</p><p>die! quluo shouted and joined hands with Mo Ye, unleashing a terrifying attack that enveloped Emperor Wanshan.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Yan kuangtu controlled the Emperor spirit tower and charged toward Emperor of mountains again.</p><p>The heavily injured Wanshan Emperor was surrounded by three experts and could no longer escape.</p><p>The emperor’s blood splattered across the firmament. In the end, the myriad mountain Emperor was killed by three powerful experts and fell in the sky above the mountain piercing sect.</p><p>The Emperor of a generation had fallen just like that.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Lu Ming was still shocked.</p><p>So what if he was an Emperor? So what if he dominated the divine wilderness continent? Didn’t he still fall?</p><p>And this was the divine wilderness mainland, the overseas mainland, the larger mainland, and even the center of the primordial realm. The yuan continent was more dangerous, with more powerful cultivators. Even with the cultivation of an Emperor, they could die if they moved, unable to protect themselves.</p><p>“Becoming an Emperor is not my end. I need to climb to a higher realm. Otherwise, I can’t even protect myself, let alone my family!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. His heart and his vision had become higher.</p><p>In the past, his goal had been to break through to the Emperor realm and kill Di Yi.</p><p>But now, his goal was not limited to the Emperor. His goal was to become a saint, or even a Saint.</p><p>Perhaps only by reaching a cultivation level that could dominate the primordial realm could one truly control their own fate and protect their family?</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p><p>“The Emperor is dead!”</p><p>“The old ancestor has fallen!”</p><p>The mountain piercing sect’s disciples and elders cried out when they saw this scene. Some of them were terrified, while others were sorrowful.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
