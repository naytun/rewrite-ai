They emitted a bright light and trembled continuously.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment, the shaking was getting more and more intense.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The huge stone tablet buzzed and the entire mountain shook. Huge rocks on the ground exploded and the stone tablet was rising slowly.</p><p>The stele rose up as if it was going to leave the mountain with the prison-suppressing stele bloodline.</p><p>Slowly, the stone tablet rose up inch by inch. It seemed that a section of the stone tablet was embedded in the mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, an extremely terrifying aura burst out from under the stone tablet.</p><p>This aura was extremely overbearing and dominated the world.</p><p>At the same time, a monstrous demonic Qi filled the air, as if a Supreme demon was about to be born.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing could vaguely see a tall figure under the stone tablet. It was a middle-aged man with a burly figure and long black hair. His demonic aura was overwhelming, like a demonic god.</p><p>the aura of an Emperor! This is an Emperor, a demon Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled. He could feel the mighty pressure of an Emperor from this figure. This was the pressure unique to an Emperor.</p><p>could it be that there’s an Emperor suppressed under the stone tablet? a demon Emperor!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind whirred and he thought of many things.</p><p>“Hahaha, after so many years, I can finally get away!”</p><p>The demonic figure let out an excited roar. Its terrifying aura surged and hit Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>Lu Ming’s five-colored concept surrounded his body. His essential core surged and his dragon power erupted to resist the pressure.</p><p>The heavenly demon bloodline appeared above Xie nianqing’s head and blocked the aura.</p><p>no, we can’t let this demon Emperor come out. Otherwise, little Qing and I won’t be able to withstand a single slap from him!</p><p>Lu Ming’s mind turned and his eyes focused. His mind was completely immersed in the prison-suppressing stele’s Blood Meridian.</p><p>“Come back here!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared in his heart. A bloody light spread out from his spine as he controlled the prison-suppressing stele bloodline with all his might, trying to retrieve it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The blood Meridian of the prison-suppressing stele trembled violently and was slowly pulled back by Lu Ming.</p><p>“Come back! Come back here!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept shouting in his heart. The blood-red light seemed to turn into a substance and his eyes were red.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the end, the prison-suppressing stele’s bloodline was pulled back by Lu Ming. It turned into a ray of blood light and flew into Lu Ming’s spine, disappearing.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele was taken back, and the light of the huge stele dimmed and fell down again.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>An unwilling roar came from under the stone tablet.</p><p>With a loud boom, the huge stone tablet came crashing down, and the entire mountain shook violently.</p><p>The monstrous demonic aura also disappeared in an instant. Lu Ming and Xie nianqing felt their bodies lighten, and they let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>The two of them did not expect that there would be a devil Emperor suppressed on the devil tablet mountain. No wonder all The Fiend clan members who entered this place had died. It must be the doing of this devil Emperor.</p><p>“Lu Ming, the reason why I feel my blood throbbing and a strong attraction is most likely because of this demon Emperor!”</p><p>Xie nianqing muttered.</p><p>“It should be so!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Xie nianqing was here because of the demon Emperor, while he was here because of the huge stone tablet, a broken one.</p><p>“What is this stone tablet? Why does it have a connection with my bloodline?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many questions in his heart.</p><p>“Kid, use your bloodline and let me out!”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice came from under the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>It was the demon Emperor!</p><p>senior, you’re the demon Emperor, while the two of us are only low-level spiritual gods. If we let you out and you kill us with a single slap, wouldn’t we be in deep trouble? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>“Haha, since you know that I’m the demon Emperor, why would you do such a thing? You saved this Emperor, so you are this Emperor’s benefactor. This Emperor will definitely repay you generously!”</p><p>The demon Empress continued to speak under the stele.</p><p>“That being said, I still don’t trust you!”</p><p>Lu Ming said bluntly.</p><p>Lu Ming did not dare to be careless in the face of an Emperor. Otherwise, he would be killed with a single slap.</p><p>There was silence under the stone tablet, as if they were thinking about what to say.</p><p>After a while, the voice spoke again,”kid, your bloodline should be the bloodline of the prison-suppressing stele, right?” I didn’t expect that someone in this world could really awaken such a bloodline.”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed but he did not say anything.</p><p>kid, let me tell you. The stele in front of you is the real prison-guarding stele, the original body of your bloodline!</p><p>The demon sovereign’s voice was heard, causing Lu Ming’s heart to tremble.</p><p>“What? Is this broken stele the real prison-guarding stele?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes widened suddenly. He was in shock and he looked at the huge stone tablet in front of him in disbelief.</p><p>“Otherwise, why do you think your bloodline can resonate with this stone tablet? Because they were originally one!”</p><p>The demon Empress continued.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing were shocked.</p><p>It was said that the bloodline awakened by all martial artists could be traced back to the world. It was real.</p><p>Some of them might have gone extinct in the immemorial era and had never appeared again. Some could be found in the modern era.</p><p>Lu Ming initially thought that the prison-suppressing stele might be an ancient item from a long time ago. He did not expect to see the real body in this world.</p><p>This made it difficult for him to calm down.</p><p>it is said that the prison-suppressing stele was a Supreme divine object in the distant past. It was broken into several pieces in a great battle. The one in front of you is a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele. The prison-suppressing stele can suppress all living things in the world. If not for this stele, how could it suppress me? ”</p><p>The demon sovereign explained Lu Ming’s doubts. His tone revealed his unrivaled confidence.</p><p>so, as long as you control your bloodline, you can take this prison-guarding stele away. If your bloodline is integrated with the real prison-guarding stele, you will obtain great benefits and a Supreme divine item. If you can collect all the other pieces of the prison-guarding stele in the future, you can use this treasure to dominate the world!</p><p>The demon Empress continued to speak. Her words were filled with temptation.</p><p>Lu Ming was indeed very tempted. There was a hint of passion in his eyes.</p><p>Bloodline was just a bloodline. It could be said to be illusionary and had a part of the power of a real object. It could also be said to be a kind of inheritance.</p><p>For example, Warriors with the true dragon bloodline could comprehend the true Dragon’s combat skills and borrow part of the true Dragon’s power. The stronger they were, the stronger the power they could exert. However, it was not the true body, so it could not be as powerful as the true body.</p><p>However, with the help of his main body, it was a different story.</p><p>Lu Ming did not expect that he would encounter the true form of the prison-suppressing stele bloodline. Now that he had encountered it, he really did not want to miss it.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows tightly, various thoughts running through his mind rapidly.</p><p>To release or not to release?</p><p>Lu Ming could not make a decision. If he let the demon sovereign out and the demon sovereign went back on his word, they would be in real danger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
