His appearance was ordinary, and his body was also ordinary. He had a medium build, and his face was very calm. He didn’t have an overbearing arrogance, nor did he have the noble and overbearing aura of a King. He was just like an ordinary young man.</p><p>However, the moment this young man walked out, he attracted everyone’s attention. Even the sovereigns turned their gazes over.</p><p>That was because the young man was long Chen.</p><p>Long Chen was a well-known name in the central continent. He was the Overlord of the central continent’s younger generation. No one could defeat him.</p><p>All along the way, he had never tasted defeat among his peers!</p><p>During the battle of Providence, he had already entered the spiritual God Realm, leading the other four magnates by a large margin.</p><p>He was known as a heaven’s favorite that only appeared once in a hundred thousand years in central continent.</p><p>No one said anything. Everyone’s eyes were on Long Chen, waiting to see how he would react.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Long Chen took a step forward.</p><p>That’s right, it was just an ordinary step, and then another.</p><p>Just like that, he took one step at a time, and walked forward step by step.</p><p>One step covered several miles!</p><p>His speed wasn’t fast. Let alone yang potian and the others, he wasn’t even as fast as a second-grade heaven’s favorite. He took a few steps forward and arrived in front of the first figure.</p><p>The figure struck out with his palm, and Long Chen did the same. With a bang, the figure exploded.</p><p>Then, Long Chen continued to move forward.</p><p>Very quickly, they arrived at the second stage. In front of the three figures, he also struck out with his palm, and the three figures exploded.</p><p>Then, he continued to step forward and came to the third stage. He waved his palm again and the nine figures exploded at the same time. It seemed very easy, like the clouds and the wind.</p><p>Then, he stepped onto the platform.</p><p>The speed of his stride wasn’t fast, but the speed at which he passed the level was very fast. Those figures couldn’t stop him at all. Therefore, in general, he had surpassed most of the second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>“This person is unfathomable!”</p><p>Lu Ming stared at Long Chen and realized that he could not see through him at all.</p><p>“I’ll go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped out. He randomly chose a path and rushed forward.</p><p>Lu Ming’s performance was not too amazing. Although he also cleared the level at an extremely fast speed, his speed was only average among the second-grade prodigies and he did not cause too much of a shock.</p><p>As Lu Ming could suppress Wu Cang previously, it was normal for him to have such a result. The others were not surprised.</p><p>After Lu Ming, a few other second-grade geniuses followed.</p><p>After the second-grade heaven’s favorites finished, no one else tried. The remaining third-grade heaven’s favorites, and even the weaker ones, all shook their heads. They didn’t need to try, because it was impossible for them to pass.</p><p>“Alright, the selection is over!”</p><p>let’s go! Xie Qitian said. With a wave of his hand, the 18 rainbow paths disappeared.</p><p>At the scene, everyone’s eyes fell on the platform.</p><p>On the platform, there were a total of 40 people.</p><p>In other words, there were only 40 people who passed the selection.</p><p>Nanming is really powerful. He has two people who are suspected to be on the same level as the five magnates and three second-grade heaven’s favorites!</p><p>Northern Plains is also very powerful, other than Tuoba Shi, there are also three second-grade heaven’s favorites!</p><p>I feel that the Western Desert is the most unfathomable. There are two people who are suspected to be big shots, but not a single second-grade heaven’s favorite. That’s not realistic. I think even the second-grade heaven’s favorites aren’t here, so I can’t see their depths at all!</p><p>indeed, the Western Desert has always been unfathomable and has a long history. No one knows how many years ago the Western Desert Saint monk appeared.</p><p>Speaking of which, the East continent is really embarrassed. Only one emperor God passed the handsome selection. Haha!</p><p>Many people were discussing it. Lu Ming looked around and it was true.</p><p>Without a doubt, the central continent had the most people. Apart from him, there were 27 people.</p><p>Five from Southern nether, four from Northern Plains, and two from Western Desert, but the two from Western Desert had unfathomable strength.</p><p>In the East barren, there was only the Emperor God.</p><p>“The eastern barren territory? Li Lai is the weakest in the forsaken land, so how can there be any prodigies? it’s already good enough that they have an Emperor God. I heard that there’s also a person called Lu Ming who’s above the Emperor God Realm, but he didn’t come.”</p><p>no, he didn’t. I’m afraid he has declined, so he doesn’t dare to come. He used to be stronger than an Emperor God, but now he’s probably even weaker than an Emperor God!</p><p>“You’re right, let’s not talk about the East continent!”</p><p>The crowd discussed and expressed their opinions, but when the eastern barren territory was mentioned, they all looked contemptuous.</p><p>In the crowd, Xue Jianyi, ao tu, Dongfang Yu, and the others gritted their teeth as they listened.</p><p>But in his heart, he felt helpless.</p><p>The eastern barren territory was indeed the weakest. This was an indisputable fact.</p><p>They used to be the top figures in the East continent. They were confident that they could make a name for themselves in the central continent.</p><p>But ever since he came to central continent, he had suffered a huge blow.</p><p>There were too many people in the central continent who were stronger than them. Even the Emperor God was only a second-grade heaven’s favorite. This made them feel dejected.</p><p>I wonder what kind of reputation Lu Ming will make if he comes to the central continent. I guess he’ll only be suppressed and won’t be able to cause much trouble!</p><p>At that moment, Blood Sword one, Dongfang Yu, ao tu, and the rest remembered Lu Ming.</p><p>However, they felt that even if Lu Ming were to come, he would not be as good as an Emperor God.</p><p>The Supreme Emperor had comprehended the will of space and was extremely powerful. In the battle of Providence, the Supreme Emperor’s will of space was still weak, but it would become stronger and stronger as time went on.</p><p>They believed that the current Emperor God had already surpassed Lu Ming.</p><p>alright, a total of 40 people. Let’s begin the first round of competition!</p><p>the rules of the first round are very simple. I’ve recorded the time you took to pass the selection. Now, I’ll divide you into two groups according to the time you took to clear the trial!</p><p>the shorter the time, the better the results. The top twenty will be in one batch, and the last twenty will be in another. The rule of the first round is that the last twenty will challenge the top twenty. If they succeed, they will advance directly. If they fail, they will be eliminated!</p><p>furthermore, everyone can only challenge once. The one being challenged can only accept one challenge!</p><p>Xie Qitian announced.</p><p>“What? The bottom twenty will challenge the top twenty?”</p><p>Many people’s expressions changed.</p><p>Without a doubt, yang potian, Shi du, and the others took the shortest amount of time. The challenged could only accept one challenge. This meant that there was definitely someone who wanted to challenge yang potian. In that case, wouldn’t shi du and the others lose for sure?</p><p>now, I’ll announce the names of the last twenty people. Wu Cang, blood Luo Zi …</p><p>Xie Qitian announced the names of the last 20, and the people who were called had rather unsightly expressions.</p><p>At the same time, they began to size up the twenty people who had not been named.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to enter the top 20!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Other than him, the second-grade geniuses that Lu Ming knew, such as the sandalwood fairy, Jing kongling, di Shen, and Wu chengkong, had all entered the top 20.</p><p>On the other hand, Kong Xin, Jun Yue, and the others were in the last 20. Liu Yuxin was also in the last 20, and her expression was rather unsightly.</p><p>The 20 at the back were sizing up the 20 at the front and choosing their opponents.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
