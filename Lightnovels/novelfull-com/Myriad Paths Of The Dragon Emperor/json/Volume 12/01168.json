I won’t go back on my word!”</p><p>...</p><p>With that, Xie Luan pointed his finger at Xie nianqing’s forehead. A black light flashed and he disappeared.</p><p>“I’ve already passed on my life’s cultivation experience and the demonic Arts I’ve cultivated to you. However, everyone’s path is different. You can learn from it, but you can’t copy it. Also, there’s a demonic Palace here. You can enter it and cultivate. It’ll be very beneficial to your cultivation!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Xie nianqing closed his eyes and sensed for a moment. Then, he nodded and cupped his fists.”Many thanks, senior!”</p><p>haha, although we’ve been separated for more than 30000 years, our fates are similar. No need to be polite!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This Xie Luan was a man of his word.</p><p>To be honest, although Lu Ming had the idea of borrowing Xie Luan’s power along the way, he had always been wary of Xie Luan. At this time, his wariness had slightly diminished.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan looked at Lu Ming. Demonic Qi gathered in his palm and condensed into a black token. He handed it to Lu Ming, then turned to Mo Ye and the others.”Brother Lu Ming is my benefactor. From now on, seeing him is the same as seeing me. He can go anywhere in the myriad demons abyss freely. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Your subordinate understands!”</p><p>Mo Ye and the rest bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>also, now that the outside world is in chaos, send people to keep an eye on the outside world. When I come out of the myriad Devil Pool, I will bring you out of the myriad Devil Pool and dominate the divine wilderness mainland!</p><p>Xie Luan loudly declared, brimming with confidence.</p><p>the devil ancestor is invincible. We will obey the devil ancestor’s orders!</p><p>Mo Ye and the rest bowed once more.</p><p>Xie Luan nodded, then turned to the center of the mountain and strode forward. The formations seemed to recognize him, and they didn’t react at all. Soon, he was gone.</p><p>Mo Ye and the others were secretly shocked. The formation of the myriad Devil Pool was extremely terrifying. Even an Emperor like Mo Ye couldn’t break through it. However, Xie Luan had entered it with ease.</p><p>It was obvious that this was a backup plan left behind by Xie Luan.</p><p>young master Lu, Lady Xie, the devil ancestor needs time to recover. You two can walk around freely. If you need anything, just look for me!</p><p>Mo Ye looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and smiled.</p><p>He could tell that Xie Luan regarded Lu Ming and Xie nianqing very highly. He had even passed on his skills to Xie nianqing in front of them. Naturally, he had to treat them with respect.</p><p>“The demon Emperor is too polite. Please go ahead. If there’s anything, I’ll go and disturb you!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>alright then. You guys go ahead and walk around. We won’t disturb you any further!</p><p>let’s go, ” Mo Ye said. He then left the place with the others and arranged for people to go out and gather information.</p><p>“Little Qing, let’s take a walk?”</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>The two of them held hands and walked in the air, casually strolling around.</p><p>Now that Xie Luan had recovered more and more, the prison-suppressing stele’s restraint on him was getting smaller and smaller. However, he was no longer affected by Lu Ming.</p><p>The two of them walked around casually and chatted.</p><p>During this period of time, they had been running around and did not get to know each other well.</p><p>On a mountain peak, the two of them leaned against each other, ignoring the clear wind and Buddha’s face. The two of them quietly enjoyed this peace and tranquility.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. In these three days, the two of them did not cultivate and just spent time together quietly.</p><p>Three days later, Xie nianqing went to the demonic Palace to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>They knew very well that the divine wilderness continent was about to fall into chaos. In such an environment, the only way was to raise their own cultivation level. That was the foundation, the root of all.</p><p>Otherwise, they would be drowned by the water sooner or later.</p><p>Compared to those Overlord forces, they were still too weak.</p><p>As for Xie Luan, they knew very well that it was only an exchange of interests.</p><p>They had saved Xie Luan, and Xie Luan might help them once or twice, but it wouldn’t last long. In the end, they still had to rely on themselves.</p><p>However, before Xie nianqing went into seclusion, Lu Ming had taught him the nine seals of the gate of God. After cultivating the nine seals of the gate of God, Xie nianqing’s combat power would be stronger.</p><p>Xie nianqing entered seclusion in the demonic Hall. Lu Ming was on a mountain peak not far from the myriad demon pool, preparing to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>However, there was still one more thing to do before he went into seclusion.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of storage rings appeared.</p><p>These storage rings were left behind by the enemies he had killed during this period of time. Many of them were left behind by high-level spiritual God powerhouses. Lu Ming had not counted them all this time. Now that he had the time, he could take a look.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram and began to sort and count the items in the storage rings.</p><p>After counting, even though Lu Ming was mentally prepared, he was still dumbfounded by the amount of wealth.</p><p>There were more than one billion raw stones.</p><p>One billion raw gemstones, what a terrifying amount of wealth was that?</p><p>“Haha, it’s enough for me to use for a long time!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>in addition, there were also many intent crystals of various grades, all of which were shockingly valuable.</p><p>Lu Ming had no use for some low-grade, middle-grade, and even high-grade profound meaning crystals, but he would leave them for the Lu clan, Hua Chi, and the others. They would be of great use to him.</p><p>In addition, there were all kinds of spiritual pills, spiritual medicines, spiritual herbs, spiritual weapons, and so on.</p><p>After all, there were dozens of high-level spiritual God powerhouses among them. The wealth they left behind was too shocking.</p><p>Lu Ming was grinning from ear to ear. He separated them into different categories and kept them.</p><p>During this period, dandan smelled the scent of spirit herbs and rushed over. Lu Ming gave him some spirit herbs to let him recover.</p><p>After counting, Lu Ming began to comprehend the intent realm of heaven and earth under the path-understanding ancient tree with the help of the profound meaning crystals.</p><p>Now that Lu Ming had enough raw gemstones, he could use them to improve his cultivation as long as he had a breakthrough in the heaven and earth essence realm.</p><p>Time quickly passed, and in the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p>One day, Lu Ming sensed something. He came out of the mountain and river diagram and looked in the direction of the myriad demon pool.</p><p>Demonic clouds gathered in the sky above the myriad Devil Pool, and demonic Qi filled the sky. An unparalleled pressure spread out.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that Xie Luan had come out of seclusion.</p><p>Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glowed. He could feel that the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele was shaking slightly.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming rose into the air and flew towards the myriad demons pool.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>The demonic Qi surged and finally gathered together, and Xie Luan’s figure appeared.</p><p>Three months later, Xie Luan’s aura was extremely terrifying, vast, and unfathomable.</p><p>Each of his muscles seemed to possess a destructive power that could destroy everything.</p><p>Lu Ming understood that Xie Luan had completely recovered to the Emperor realm. Lu Ming had no idea to what extent he had reached.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Ye and the others had also flown over. However, Xie Luan waved his hand, and they all stopped in the distance, not approaching.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the fragment of the prison-suppressing stele flew out of Lu Ming’s body. It grew rapidly to the size of a mountain, flying toward Xie Luan and floating above his head.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, Xie Luan struck the fragment of the prison-guarding stele with his palm. The fragment began to shake violently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
