The cultivation environment in the divine Ruins continent was indeed better than that in the divine wilderness continent. He felt that cultivating here was easier than in the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>...</p><p>Suddenly, there was a violent explosion outside.</p><p>Lu Ming opened his eyes, feeling a little surprised.</p><p>There were people fighting outside, but who would be fighting here?</p><p>Lu Ming got up and opened the door. When he saw Xie nianqing walking out of his room, the two of them were a little surprised. They walked out of the courtyard and saw that the sky was bright and powerful not far away.</p><p>In the air, some people were watching.</p><p>The unscrupulous monk, yang potian, Ming Zi, Tuoba Shi, and the others were all there.</p><p>On the other side, there were more than a dozen unfamiliar young men.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the battlefield. It was Shi du fighting with a young man in scale armor.</p><p>At this moment, the lion had already transformed into its original form. It was a mighty golden divine Lion. Its entire body was shining with golden light, and golden flames were dancing.</p><p>Compared to when he was in the holy city, Lion City was much stronger. His cultivation had also broken through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm. With a long roar, the heavens and earth shook, and even the mountains trembled.</p><p>However, at this moment, Shi du was at a complete disadvantage. The young man in the scale armor was obviously much stronger than Shi du. He punched out again and again, causing the lion to roll in the air.</p><p>“What a majestic Lion. Not bad, it’s quite mighty. How is it? In the future, be my Mount and follow this young master to eat and drink well!”</p><p>The youth’s mocking voice rang out, causing Shi du to be even more enraged. His roar shook the heavens.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>In the distance, a figure flickered and flew over.</p><p>Clearly, they were alarmed by the battle here.</p><p>Many of them were young people. Lu Ming guessed that they might be geniuses from other continents or the South God Palace.</p><p>“Hehe, they really started fighting!”</p><p>Mu Feng sneered in the crowd. He had not gone far when he heard the commotion and came back to watch the show.</p><p>“Which two continents are they from?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>it’s the divine wilderness continent and the Shen ‘e continent!</p><p>Mu Feng replied.</p><p>“Oh? So it’s these two continents. In ancient times, the divine Ruins ‘continent group used to have a ranking of continents. The divine alligator continent’s ranking has always been very high, even charging into the top ten when it was at its strongest, while the divine wilderness continent’s ranking has always been below average. I wonder how it’s doing now?”</p><p>I’ve heard that the Shen ‘e continent has always been very strong. Although they might not be in the top ten, they won’t be too bad either. Most of the divine wilderness continent’s heaven’s favorites are not their match.</p><p>“Eh? That male lion from the divine wilderness continent is about to lose!”</p><p>The surrounding spectators discussed animatedly.</p><p>“Tuoba Shi, what’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing came to Tuoba Shi’s side and asked.</p><p>general Lu is from the Shen ‘e continent. They were originally assigned to live on soldier peak. Now, they want to drive us to soldier peak and let them live on general peak!</p><p>Tuoba Shi explained.</p><p>Lu Ming understood it in one sentence.</p><p>The general’s peak was high and mighty, looking down on the soldier’s peak. The proud heaven’s pride experts of the Shen ‘e continent were proud and arrogant. How could they be looked down upon by heaven’s pride experts of other continents?</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>In the sky, even the Lions were howling madly, but it was useless. The difference in combat strength was too great, and they were completely suppressed.</p><p>Shi DU’s cultivation was at the third level of the spiritual God Realm, while the other party’s cultivation was at the peak of the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>Furthermore, there was no doubt that those who could participate in the Tian Shen sect’s selection had awakened a bloodline that was definitely of the ninth divine level.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a few more moves, Shi du was beaten to the point where he spat out a large mouthful of blood and fell heavily to the ground of the general peak.</p><p>with such strength, you want to participate in the selection of the major sects of the yuanlu continent? you’re overestimating yourself!</p><p>The scaled youth stood high in the sky and looked down at the lion Capital.</p><p>Even the lion roared in grievance, but its strength was inferior to the human.</p><p>The other people from the divine wilderness continent did not look too good either.</p><p>After all, they were all from the divine wilderness continent. No matter what kind of conflict they had in the divine wilderness continent, they were all together in the divine Ruins. If even the lion was suppressed, they would lose face.</p><p>The scaled youth’s eyes were cold and arrogant as he continued to stare at Lion Capital, ” “How is it? Be my Mount.”</p><p>“In your dreams!”</p><p>Even the lion roared.</p><p>then I’ll beat you up until you become my Mount. Haha, there’s also a Peacock with the bloodline of the five elements Peacock. It’s not bad either. I’ll take it as my Mount as well. This trip is quite rewarding!</p><p>Towards the end of his speech, the scaled youth’s gaze swept over Kong Lin’s body, and a strand of fierce light flashed past.</p><p>Then, he continued to attack Lion City.</p><p>“Lion Capital, I’m here to help you!”</p><p>Kong Lin’s expression was difficult. With a long hiss, he turned into a five-colored peacock and pounced towards the scaled youth.</p><p>Lion Capital saw this opportunity and cooperated with Kong Lin. The two of them joined forces to fight the other party.</p><p>“Hehe, what’s the point of joining hands?”</p><p>The scaled youth sneered, and a giant crocodile appeared above his head.</p><p>Nine golden chakras glowed around the crocodile.</p><p>Divine beast, crocodile Emperor!</p><p>the scaled youth used bloodline fusion and transformed into a massive crocodile Emperor.</p><p>“Lose!”</p><p>The Emperor crocodile roared and its tail swept out like a divine whip, hitting Kong Lin. The five elements divine light on Kong Lin’s body was broken at once. With a wail, the five-colored feathers flew and his body was sent flying.</p><p>At the same time, the crocodile Emperor hit Shi du with its palm, sending him flying.</p><p>Shi du and Kong Lin joined hands and were not the other party’s match.</p><p>you two pieces of trash. You can barely be used as a Mount. You still want to resist? ”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor looked around and said in disdain.</p><p>He then swept his gaze over Lu Ming, Ming Zi, yang potian, and the rest. I’ll say it again. General peak, our Shen ‘e continent is ours. If you know what’s good for you, get lost. Otherwise, we’ll fight you one by one!</p><p>“How arrogant!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi licked his lips. He really wanted to go up and fight, but his cultivation had yet to break through to the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. He knew that he would not be a match for the other party.</p><p>“My hair!”</p><p>The monk chanted the name of Buddha and squinted his eyes.</p><p>However, it was obvious that no one would leave this place easily.</p><p>“You’re not going to get lost? Then I’ll fight them one by one!”</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s eyes flashed with ferocity. It glanced at the crowd and finally landed on Ming Zi. you’re next. Just now, you showed me your killing intent. Don’t think I didn’t sense it. Kneel down!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor was very domineering. As soon as it finished speaking, a beam of light shot out of its eyes and headed for Ming Zi.</p><p>Dark child’s eyes turned cold as endless dark energy erupted. Within the dark energy, ghostly wails and wolf howls could be heard. It was extremely horrifying.</p><p>A blade appeared in his hand. It was a black scimitar with evil ghosts appearing on it. It was extremely realistic, as if they were going to climb out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ming Zi wielded his scimitar and smashed the light beam.</p><p>At the same time, Dark Child rose into the air and stood in front of the Emperor alligator. A powerful aura burst out.</p><p>Fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>It was obvious that Dark Child had also made a breakthrough during this period of time and stepped into the fourth level spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“If you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>A cold voice came out of Dark child’s mouth.</p><p>fourth level spiritual God Realm. The divine wilderness continent has finally produced a decent person. However, he has just broken through to the fourth level spiritual God Realm not long ago. He is still far from being able to fight me!</p><p>The crocodile Emperor’s disdainful voice was heard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
