His face and eyes were very cold.</p><p>At this moment, Xie nianqing’s body was filled with demonic Qi. He gently pressed his palms and a terrifying force field spread out in a radius of a hundred miles, destroying everything.</p><p>At the same time, there was a beautiful woman sitting on top of Xie nianqing’s head. She was surrounded by demonic power and demonic Qi. She sat cross-legged on a Black Lotus and kept striking out with her palms to block the attacks from all directions.</p><p>This was Xie nianqing’s bloodline, the third bloodline. It was very similar to his second bloodline, but there were nine golden Chakra Rings around his body.</p><p>Divine level ninth rank bloodline!</p><p>Moreover, Xie nianqing’s cultivation had also entered the third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>There were eleven people attacking Xie nianqing.</p><p>The eleven fiend clan members were all at the sixth level of the spiritual God Realm. Each of them held a bone spike in their hands and attacked Xie nianqing fiercely.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s fearsome force field covered an area of a hundred miles. The speed of the fiends was greatly affected. Even though Xie nianqing focused on defense, he was still at a disadvantage. If this continued, defeat was imminent.</p><p>“Little girl, hand over the demonic statue and I can leave your corpse intact. Otherwise, you will end up in a miserable state!”</p><p>this human girl is really a national beauty. Even I’m tempted by her. After I capture her, I’ll let her have a taste of my power!</p><p>A series of unpleasant and ear-piercing sounds rang out.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>At that moment, the killing intent in Lu Ming’s heart exploded.</p><p>In his body, the eight Dragon powers suddenly burst out, filling his body with an extremely powerful strength.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and charged into Xie nianqing’s force field like a black spear. He activated the prison suppressing heaven technique and threw a punch at one of the demons.</p><p>This devil Clansman had never thought that someone would attack him at this time. He reacted and wanted to Dodge, but it was too late.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed directly on the back of the Mosha Clansman. A terrifying force exploded, piercing a large hole in the Mosha Clansman’s body and killing him in one blow.</p><p>When Xie nianqing heard the commotion, he thought that more reinforcements from The Fiend clan had arrived, so he instinctively looked in their direction.</p><p>When she saw Lu Ming’s figure, her delicate body trembled and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>At this moment, her gaze was completely focused on Lu Ming. She could not move her eyes away.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A sharp sound was heard as it approached Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked and furious. He rushed towards Xie nianqing at top speed.</p><p>At this moment, one of the demons seized the opportunity to attack Xie nianqing.</p><p>After Lu Ming’s shout, Xie nianqing finally reacted. He activated his force field and retreated quickly. However, he was still a step too late. His shoulder was pierced by the sharp bone spur of The Fiend clan. A small wound appeared and blood flowed out.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl as his third bloodline emerged. A trace of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, causing his hair and eyes to turn blood red.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>His third bloodline turned into a combat sword. Lu Ming held the blood-colored combat sword in his hand and used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps to appear in front of the sneak-attacking fiend clan member. He slashed out with his sword, and a sword light burst forth, directly splitting the sixth level spiritual God Realm expert into two.</p><p>“Lu … Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing did not care about his injuries. His eyes were still fixed on Lu Ming. He did not want to look away.</p><p>She was afraid. She was afraid that all of this was just an illusion, a dream. Once she looked away, everything in front of her would disappear.</p><p>She had already lost count of how many times she had had such a dream.</p><p>“Little Qing, I’m here!”</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and held Xie nianqing’s small hand.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s hand was cold.</p><p>The heat from Lu Ming’s palm was transmitted to Xie nianqing’s small hand. Xie nianqing’s body trembled, and tears welled up in his big eyes.</p><p>“Lu Ming, really … Is it really you? I’m not dreaming?”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming in a daze. His little hand clutched Lu Ming’s big hand tightly, as if he was afraid that Lu Ming would disappear if he let go.</p><p>idiot, it’s really me. Let’s kill these fiend clan members first!</p><p>Lu Ming said gently, then scanned his surroundings.</p><p>Lu Ming’s sudden appearance and his lightning-fast killing of two of the Mosha clan’s experts shocked the other Mosha clan members. They retreated far away and did not attack for a while.</p><p>he’s also a human at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. Just now, he launched a surprise attack and killed the two of us. There’s nothing to be afraid of. If we join forces, it’s enough to kill them!</p><p>One of the mo Sha clansmen said, his eyes cold.</p><p>“That’s right, let’s attack together and kill!”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The remaining nine demons attacked at the same time. The bone spikes in their palms pierced through the air and shot toward Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>Xie nianqing finally collected his thoughts. With a shout, he pressed his palm and a terrifying force field exploded.</p><p>After three years, Xie nianqing had awakened his third bloodline and his cultivation had reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm. Her force field seemed to have made a breakthrough and become even more terrifying.</p><p>The demonic energy field enveloped the area. At the same time, there was a terrifying destructive power in the energy field, which greatly reduced the speed of the Mosha clan. However, Lu Ming was not affected at all.</p><p>“This intent?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. He realized that Xie nianqing’s intent realm was more powerful than before. It was a terrifying demonic intent realm.</p><p>Without much time to think, Lu Ming stepped forward. His killing intent was like a tide as he charged towards the Mosha clan.</p><p>He realized that the eighth dragon power was indeed powerful. Now that all eight Dragon powers were unleashed, his combat power was even stronger than before.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in front of one of the Mosha clansmen. His cold killing intent enveloped him, causing the Mosha Clansman to shudder.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The blood-red sword light slashed toward The Fiend Clansman. The terrifying power shocked The Fiend Clansman, and he hurriedly blocked it with his bone spur.</p><p>The bone spur was broken with a clang. With a flash of sword light, the arm of the demon Sha was cut off.</p><p>The Mosha Clansman was horrified. He wanted to escape, but Lu Ming’s second sword attack was launched.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood spurted out and a head flew high into the air.</p><p>A sixth level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha clan member was killed in an instant.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to deal with a sixth level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha clan alone, it would not be so easy to kill him without a sneak attack. It would most likely take some effort.</p><p>However, with Xie nianqing’s help, killing a sixth level spiritual God Realm Mo Sha was a piece of cake.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After killing the one from the Mosha clan, Lu Ming went on to kill another.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them seemed to have returned to the past, back to the time when they were adventuring and adventuring together in the East continent. At that time, the two of them had also cooperated like this.</p><p>The cooperation between the two of them was already very tacit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
