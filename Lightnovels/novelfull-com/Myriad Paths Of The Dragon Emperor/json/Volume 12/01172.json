At Lu Ming’s command, terrifying existences stepped out from behind him and charged at the cold-blood Hall people.</p><p>...</p><p>The experts of cold-blood Hall, including blood Luo Zi, were shocked because the experts coming at them were too powerful. There were no less than six or seven sovereigns and many advanced spiritual gods.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill them!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi shrieked, but he retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The experts from both sides collided, creating a shocking shockwave.</p><p>Black demonic qi and blood-red demonic Qi soared into the sky and filled the entire region.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stepped forward and walked toward blood Luo Zi.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi, you escaped with your life talisman in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. Today, I’ll take your life!</p><p>Lu Ming stared at blood Luo Zi and walked toward him step by step.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s face turned ugly. He retreated quickly and roared, ” “Kill him!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Beside Xue Luo Zi, a middle-aged man in a blood-red robe charged at Lu Ming. He was a perfected spiritual God. However, as soon as he appeared, another expert rushed out from behind Lu Ming and blocked him.</p><p>“Now, let’s see who can save you!”</p><p>Said Lu Ming. That perfected spiritual God was the last powerful person around blood Luo Zi. The rest were not worth mentioning.</p><p>“Kill, kill him!”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi continued to shout.</p><p>The two seventh level spiritual God Realm experts charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palms, and the two seventh level spiritual God Realm experts were torn to pieces.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s face turned pale with fear. An expert at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm was killed by Lu Ming with one palm. How could he be so powerful?</p><p>“No one can save you today!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a few steps forward and approached blood Luo Zi rapidly.</p><p>“Save me, forefather, save me!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi screamed in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming could even kill a seventh level spiritual God Realm expert with a flip of his hand, let alone him?</p><p>He was really afraid!</p><p>The other cold-blood Hall experts wanted to help, but they were all entangled by their opponents and could not get away.</p><p>Some experts were further away and could not make it in time.</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering roar came from the sky. Then, a ray of blood-red light broke through the sky and slashed toward Lu Ming with an aura that could destroy everything.</p><p>“Patriarch, haha, Lu Ming, die!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi was overjoyed and revealed a ferocious expression.</p><p>The attack was filled with the pressure of an Emperor. It was the Emperor of cold-blood Hall who wanted to kill Lu Ming in one blow.</p><p>However, at this moment, behind Lu Ming, a burly man in iron armor burst out with an earth-shattering aura. His demonic might was unparalleled. With a flash of demonic light, he destroyed the blood light.</p><p>“I didn’t want to gang up on you, but since you’re looking for death, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Mo Ye looked at the sky with a cold look. The next moment, he turned into a beam of demonic light and rushed into the sky, attacking the cold-blood Hall Emperor together with the suspended mountain’s Emperor.</p><p>“The Emperor, it’s the Emperor!”</p><p>Everyone else was dumbfounded.</p><p>Xie Luan did not come, but apart from him, there was actually an Emperor behind Lu Ming. This was too shocking.</p><p>Many people from cold-blood Hall were in despair. The consequences would be severe if two emperors attacked the Emperor of cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“Demon Emperor!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi screamed in fear, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming took another step forward and appeared in front of Xue Luo Zi. He struck his palm down.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi roared and used the bloodline fusion to transform into a blood-winged bat to resist.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s palm struck down and the blood-winged bat was crushed by the terrifying force. Not only the blood-winged bat, but Xue Luozi’s body was also shattered.</p><p>Xue Luo Zi was dead!</p><p>The people of cold-blood Hall were shocked. Master Xue Luo, a genius who had the potential to become an Emperor, was dead. It was a great loss for cold-blood Hall.</p><p>An angry roar came from the sky.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? you can’t even protect yourself today!”</p><p>Mo Ye’s voice rang out from the sky.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the bloodline of the nine Dragons to devour the blood essence and energy of the blood Luo Zi. However, Lu Ming frowned immediately.</p><p>This was because the blood Luo Zi cultivated the mentality of blood, which was not of much use to Lu Ming.</p><p>Only the blood essence had some use.</p><p>At this moment, on the floating mountain, an extremely beautiful woman was looking at the battlefield outside.</p><p>This woman was Jing kongling!</p><p>Beside her stood a few experts from the floating mountain sect.</p><p>open the formation and fight our way out. Work with Lu Ming and attack cold-blood Hall from both sides!</p><p>At this moment, Jing kongling opened his mouth and gave an order.</p><p>Now, the second-class geniuses had grown up and entered the spiritual God Realm one after another. As these second-class geniuses entered the spiritual God Realm, their status in their respective sects and forces also rose. They were comparable to some Supremes, or even higher, and they had an important right to speak.</p><p>This was because second-grade geniuses were bound to become Supreme-beings in the future. They even had a high chance of becoming emperors, and their potential was limitless. The various major factions had already begun to slowly transfer some power to them as a way to hone themselves.</p><p>Just like Xue Luo Zi, in the floating mountain, the pure Void Spirit also had an important right to speak.</p><p>“Kong Ling, it’s too dangerous. Who knows if Lu Ming will turn around and target us, the floating mountain sect!”</p><p>An elder beside the pristine Void Spirit asked with a slightly changed expression.</p><p>that’s right. In these troubled times, Lu Ming and Xie Luan are walking together, and there’s actually an Emperor following them. We have to be on guard!</p><p>The other person said.</p><p>don’t worry. Lu Ming and I are old friends. I trust him. Open the formation and work with Lu Ming. We must completely destroy cold-blood Hall in today’s battle. Otherwise, we won’t have such a good opportunity if we miss it!</p><p>Jing kongling said with a firm tone.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll listen to you!”</p><p>An old man said. Then, his voice spread throughout the floating mountain.”Open the formation and kill our way out!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The formation was activated, and the floating mountain gathered its power and charged toward cold-blood Hall.</p><p>They and Lu Ming’s men attacked cold-blood Hall from both sides. Cold-blood Hall was in chaos and at a disadvantage. One by one, the experts were killed.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, the battle was the most intense, and the sky kept shaking.</p><p>All of a sudden, a blood-red light appeared. An arm fell from the sky with a soaring blood Qi, emitting a strong Emperor’s pressure.</p><p>it’s the blood Emperor! The blood Emperor is injured!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall people were especially pale.</p><p>the blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall is about to be defeated. Kill him!</p><p>Lu Ming’s men and those from the floating mountain sect took the opportunity to shout. Their morale was greatly boosted, and they completely suppressed cold-blood Hall. Cold-blood Hall experts were killed one after another, and their bodies fell to the ground like rain.</p><p>Lu Ming controlled the nine Dragons ‘bloodline and walked on the battlefield, devouring energy and blood essence.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
