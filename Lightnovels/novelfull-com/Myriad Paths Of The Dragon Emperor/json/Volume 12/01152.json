These people will be my tonics. They can help me recover some vitality!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed and transformed into a ball of demonic Qi. He wrapped the blood and flesh of the heaven martial sword sect’s expert that Lu Ming had killed and absorbed them all.</p><p>It was unknown what kind of cultivation technique Xie Luan was cultivating, but it was extremely overbearing. It could directly absorb a warrior’s essence, Qi, and spirit and transform them into his own essence. It was comparable to the devouring power of the nine Dragons.</p><p>Of course, Xie Luan’s cultivation level was unfathomable, and he was considered an expert even among emperors. It was normal for him to have all sorts of tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>Then, Xie Luan did the same thing and absorbed the remaining four.</p><p>The demonic Qi on Xie Luan’s body wriggled, and his aura grew stronger.</p><p>those at the fifth and sixth level of the spiritual God Realm are too weak. They can only recover a little, but it’s better than nothing. Lu Ming, there are seventh level spiritual God Realm martial artists rushing over from the East. Hehe, they’re pretty good tonics!</p><p>Xie Luan sneered.</p><p>Although Xie Luan’s qi and blood were weak, and his combat strength was far worse than when he was at his peak, his spiritual sense was still very terrifying. It was the spiritual sense of a Martial Emperor, which could sense the situation over a long distance.</p><p>Therefore, he could sense the enemy in advance every time.</p><p>“Seventh level of the spiritual God Realm? Then kill!”</p><p>There was a sharp glint in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>He guessed that the Royal Xie family must have promised him a great reward. Otherwise, why would these non-members of the Royal Xie family want to kill him so badly?</p><p>However, if they wanted to kill him, they had to be prepared to be killed in return.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and headed east.</p><p>At this moment, two burly men in their fifties or sixties were flying in Lu Ming’s direction from the East.</p><p>Both of them were dressed in white robes and carried combat swords on their backs. One look and one could tell that they were experts from the heavenly martial Sword School.</p><p>One of them was holding an array board in his hand. On the array board, there was a light spot flashing not far from them.</p><p>“We’re almost there. Lu Ming is over there!”</p><p>“He’s not dead yet. Haha, it seems like we found him first.”</p><p>The two of them smiled at each other, their eyes burning with passion.</p><p>“Eh? Why is he approaching us?”</p><p>Suddenly, one of them spoke.</p><p>They discovered that the dot of light on the formation plate was rapidly approaching them.</p><p>haha, this kid is really courting death. He must not know we are here, so he chose a random direction and came to our side. Haha, it seems that even the heavens are helping us!</p><p>Another man laughed.</p><p>They naturally didn’t know of Xie Luan’s existence.</p><p>The matter of Xie Luan was too important. The Royal Xie family had not leaked it. In fact, only a few people in the Royal Xie family knew about it. The Royal Xie family had only mentioned Lu Ming to the public.</p><p>The two of them spoke as they flew.</p><p>Not long after, a black-robed young man stepped through the air.</p><p>The three of them looked at each other.</p><p>However, to the surprise of the two powerhouses from the sky martial sword faction, Lu Ming’s eyes did not seem to be surprised at all when he saw them. Instead, there was a hint of killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>This gave the two of them a bad feeling.</p><p>He shook his head and threw the bad premonition out of his mind.</p><p>He was only a junior at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. No matter how strong and heaven-defying he was, how could he cross four levels and fight with them, who were at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm?</p><p>They had lived for thousands of years, yet they had never heard of a heaven’s pride expert who could cross four levels in the spiritual God Realm and fight a seventh level spiritual God while being at the third level.</p><p>How could anyone who could reach the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm be weak? they were all extremely powerful existences. When they were young, they were all geniuses of a region.</p><p>They felt that they were overthinking things.</p><p>let’s attack together and kill this brat. We’ll split the rewards equally according to their value!</p><p>One of them said.</p><p>Although they felt that Lu Ming could not possibly be their match, they still decided to attack together and end the battle as soon as possible to avoid any complications.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The other man nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Whoosh!…</p><p>The Battle Sword buzzed, and the sword Qi broke through the air, stirring up the wind and clouds.</p><p>The two of them took a step forward at the same time and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll leave one to you and the other to me!”</p><p>Xie Luan appeared and transformed into a stream of demonic Qi, sweeping toward one of them.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Without saying anything else, Lu Ming charged at one of them. His palm was like a heavenly blade as he used the prison suppressing heaven technique to suppress the enemy.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The palm and his opponent’s sword clashed heavily, creating a terrifying boom.</p><p>At the point where the palm and the sword met, a ripple spread out at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, a mountain peak that reached into the clouds was swept by the ripples and was directly cut in half. Gravel broke through the air and smoke filled the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After the exchange of blows, a figure retreated three steps.</p><p>It was the expert from the heavenly martial sword faction. He retreated, but Lu Ming’s body only swayed a little.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>The expert from the heavenly martial Sword School widened his eyes in disbelief.</p><p>Facing the attack head-on, he was actually forced back by Lu Ming’s palm. How was this possible?</p><p>He clearly discovered that Lu Ming’s cultivation was indeed at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. A third level spiritual God actually forced him, a seventh level spiritual God, to take three steps back. This was too terrifying.</p><p>this kid is too monstrous. Kill him, we must kill him!</p><p>The sky martial Sword school’s expert roared in his heart as he circulated his Zhen Yuan to the extreme. At the same time, he performed bloodline fusion, turning it into a combat sword and exploding with his strongest combat power.</p><p>This person had a divine level rank 5 bloodline!</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar resounded and the nine Dragon bloodline emerged. Lu Ming also burst out the nine Dragon bloodline and performed the bloodline fusion to transform into Nine Dragons.</p><p>The nine Dragons roared as they stepped into the air and pounced toward the other party.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Dragon claws tore through the sky and collided with the combat sword continuously, but the combat sword was completely at a disadvantage and could not fight against the nine Dragons.</p><p>When Lu Ming first entered the abyss demon territory, he had to borrow the third bloodline’s power in excess to kill the seventh level spiritual God Realm expert from the Xie family.</p><p>But now, Lu Ming did not need to borrow the third bloodline’s power excessively to suppress the other party.</p><p>After more than ten moves, the combat sword was completely suppressed. It was constantly bombarded by the nine Dragons and kept shaking.</p><p>Every single move of the nine Dragons contained the prison suppressing heavenly art, and its power was simply too great.</p><p>Every move was like a divine monument pressing down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a blood-curdling screech came from nearby. It was from another expert of the heavenly martial Sword School. He had been killed by Xie Luan, and was now wrapped in a mass of demonic Qi.</p><p>This made the powerhouse who was fighting with Lu Ming tremble in his heart. Fear filled his heart.</p><p>His heart was in a mess, and his strength became weaker. Lu Ming seized the opportunity to hit the sword with a few consecutive moves.</p><p>With a bang, the sword exploded, revealing the man’s true body. His face was pale and he spat out blood. He retreated quickly, trying to escape.</p><p>The nine Dragons stomped on the air at a terrifying speed, chasing after the other party and launching a series of attacks.</p><p>After a few moves, the man let out a blood-curdling screech as his chest was pierced by the nine Dragons ‘claws. He was killed on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
