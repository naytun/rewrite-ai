There was actually a demon Emperor lying in wait here. He had never heard of it in the outside world.</p><p>...</p><p>A demon Emperor and so many Supreme-beings were enough to establish a dominant force in the outside world and compete with the heroes of the world.</p><p>hahaha, I didn’t expect the younger generation of the demon abyss to be so good. There’s actually an Emperor. However, his talent is not bad, and his ambition is not small!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed heartily. His words seemed to be hinting at something.</p><p>It was obvious that Xie Luan was referring to the other party’s great ambitions, and that they wanted to disown Xie Luan and dominate the world.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The other party was wearing black battle armor and had monstrous demonic Qi. He snorted coldly and said, ” “I don’t know who you are. However, he’s so audacious that he’s only a hair’s breadth away from becoming an Emperor, yet he still dares to impersonate the chaotic sky Emperor. It’s simply laughable.”</p><p>Indeed, Xie Luan’s cultivation hadn’t fully recovered to Emperor realm yet. He was still a sliver away, so his aura didn’t seem to be there yet.</p><p>This was also the reason why he was so bold.</p><p>“You guys, go up and test out just what kind of ability he has that he dares to impersonate the chaotic heavens divine warrior!”</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor looked at the ten-odd Supreme martial artists.</p><p>The dozen Supreme martial artists ‘expressions changed drastically. For a moment, no one dared to step forward, and they were hesitant.</p><p>They had all seen Xie Lun’s statues or portraits, all of which had been carved with inscriptions. Xie Lun’s divine presence and aura had been carved into them, making them almost identical to the person in front of them.</p><p>How would they dare to make a move?</p><p>“What a bunch of trash!”</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor shouted coldly when he saw that the Supreme martial artists did not dare to come forward.</p><p>“Don’t send them to their deaths. You’re very ambitious, but you don’t know your combat strength. Let me test your combat strength!”</p><p>Xie Luan strode forward, a terrifyingly powerful Qi rising from his body.</p><p>Endless demonic Qi gathered above Xie Luan’s head, like a demonic cloud.</p><p>Hmph, you’re not even an Emperor yet, and you want to fight me? you’re looking for death! Devil domain!</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor shouted. A dark domain visible to the naked eye appeared around him. With him as the center, it spread out toward Xie Lun.</p><p>It was similar to Xie nianqing’s sky demon power field, but it was much more powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A black domain also spread out from Xie Lun’s body. It was also a domain, and it spread outward with him as the center.</p><p>The two’s domains were like two air bubbles. When they met in the air, a deafening boom was produced. This was a confrontation between two domains. If an ordinary spirit God expert were to get close, they would be crushed into powder.</p><p>“Kill! Demonic sky ten strikes!”</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor shouted and strode forward, launching a powerful attack. He clenched his fist and changed his palm from time to time, attacking Xie Luan with his demonic domain.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Xie Luan’s attack was extremely direct. All the muscles in his body bulged like a demonic weapon as he threw a punch.</p><p>With one punch, his opponent’s domain trembled violently and was almost penetrated. Then, his fist collided with his opponent’s palm.</p><p>The sky exploded like thunder, and the two figures trembled and retreated.</p><p>“Undying mo physique, it’s the undying mo physique!”</p><p>“It’s really The Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>A few Supreme martial artists cried out in shock.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, there were many who cultivated the demonic path. There were also more than one or two who had become emperors as demons. However, in the past million years, there was only one person who had cultivated the immortal demonic body, and that person was Xie Luan.</p><p>The other demon sovereigns had broken through to the sovereign level and cultivated their spiritual bodies, but they were not as strong as the immortal demon body.</p><p>There were also strong and weak spirit bodies.</p><p>The immortal demon body was one of the stronger types of spirit bodies.</p><p>Even if Xie Luan was still a hair away from recovering to the Emperor realm, he could still fight an ordinary Emperor with his immortal demonic body and his battle experience.</p><p>Some people had some doubts before, but after the immortal demon body was revealed, no one had any more doubts.</p><p>“Chaotic art of the heavenly Devil, create chaos in the world!”</p><p>However, Zhan Jia demonic Emperor’s killing intent was even more intense. He performed an unparalleled demonic technique. Endless demonic Qi gathered and a terrible aura filled the world, as if it was going to turn the world upside down.</p><p>However, Xie Luan’s eyes were calm, and there was even a hint of a sneer in them. His body directly charged into the endless demonic Qi.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor’s face turned ferocious. He was about to attack Xie Luan, but suddenly, his face changed. Endless demonic Qi started to shake violently. His body also trembled violently. Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Xie Luan rushed out and struck Zhan Jia demonic Emperor with his sky-covering palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The armor of battle armor demonic Emperor was pierced through, and the sound of bones breaking was heard.</p><p>But Xie Luan didn’t stop. He threw another punch.</p><p>This punch had broken half of his body.</p><p>the chaotic Heavenly Devil technique was created by me. When I passed it on to the demon abyss, I left a flaw long ago. I was afraid that the demon abyss or its descendants would rebel one day.</p><p>Xie Luan’s voice was extremely cold.</p><p>When Zhan Jia demonic Emperor had used the chaotic art of the heavenly demon, Xie Luan had caught his weakness and severely injured him.</p><p>Xie Luan had already prepared a backup plan.</p><p>Xie Luan grabbed Zhan Jia demonic Emperor’s neck with his claws. He said with a cold killing intent, ” “Traitors should be killed!”</p><p>no, please spare me, ancestor devil! Please spare me! It’s all a misunderstanding! I thought someone was impersonating you, so I wanted to test you!</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor struggled with all his might and begged for mercy.</p><p>Half of his body had been destroyed, but as an Emperor, he had cultivated a spirit body and had a terrifying life force. Even if half of his body had been destroyed, he could quickly recover.</p><p>To an Emperor, regrowing a broken limb was a simple task.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes were still cold, and he had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>yes, yes. If I had known that it was you, ancestor devil, who had descended, I wouldn’t have dared to make a move even if you lent me 10000 guts. Don’t worry, ancestor devil. Since you have returned to this world, I will be loyal to you in the future!</p><p>Zhan Jia demon Emperor shouted.</p><p>“Oh, really? Originally, I would have killed a traitor, but now I need people, so I can spare your life. Make a blood oath and I’ll give you a chance to atone for your crimes in the future!”</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor had no choice but to swear a blood oath to be loyal to Xie Luan in order to save his life.</p><p>Only then did Xie Luan release Zhan Jia demon Emperor.</p><p>Zhan Jia demonic Emperor gasped for breath and started to recover with demonic Qi spreading all over his body.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>Xie Luan asked Zhan Jia devil Emperor.</p><p>“Your subordinate Mo Ye pays his respects to The Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>The battle-armored demon Emperor said respectfully.</p><p>“Your subordinate welcomes the return of The Fiend ancestor!”</p><p>The others also kowtowed.</p><p>yes, I’ve been trapped for 30000 years and need the myriad Devil Pool to recover. Take me to the myriad Devil Pool!</p><p>Xie Luan ordered.</p><p>Mo Ye, a dozen Supreme martial artists, and a few spiritual God experts hurriedly nodded.</p><p>“Lu Ming, little girl, come together. I have something to say!”</p><p>Xie Luan looked at Lu Ming and Xie nianqing.</p><p>The two of them nodded and followed Xie Luan, Mo Ye, and the others. They flew over the city and arrived at the top of a huge mountain.</p><p>This mountain was surrounded by inscription arrays and had been sealed off. This was the myriad fiend pool, one of the Trump cards Xie Lun had left behind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
