However, he had never fought with the people of the five big shots, so many people were skeptical.</p><p>Each of the five overlords of the central continent was an era-suppressing genius. Not everyone could reach that level. Who would believe it without seeing it with their own eyes?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, Dark child’s aura skyrocketed, and a terrifying pressure filled the air.</p><p>Then-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Dark Child turned into a beam of light and rushed forward at a terrifying speed.</p><p>In the first stage, the figure had just struck out with a palm force when Dark Child rushed past it. His body exploded immediately, not causing any hindrance to Dark Child.</p><p>In the second round, the three figures attacked at the same time. Their palm prints were mighty, but the result was the same as the previous figure. Dark Child rushed through them and the three figures exploded.</p><p>Dark child’s speed wasn’t affected at all. It was as if the three spirit God powerhouses were air.</p><p>Dark child’s figure was like a stream of light. In the third stage, the nine figures couldn’t stop Dark child’s figure at all. He was also rushed through, and all nine figures exploded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Dark child’s figure appeared on the platform.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps could be heard at the scene.</p><p>It was too powerful and terrifying. An ordinary first level spiritual God Realm expert was like an empty shell in front of Dark Child. He rushed past them. In the eyes of many people, Dark Child had just turned into a black stream of light. In a flash, he had arrived on the opposite side in a shockingly short time.</p><p>it’s too terrifying. This kind of strength far exceeds ordinary second-grade heaven’s favorites. He’s definitely at the level of the five magnates.</p><p>that’s right. We’ll watch this. The heaven’s favorites from the other territories will clash with the five magnates. It’ll be very exciting!</p><p>Dark child’s strength shocked everyone.</p><p>“Haha, then, I’ll also set off!”</p><p>With a loud laugh, a young man in a golden robe stepped out.</p><p>This person was dressed in gold, golden hair, golden clothes, and golden battle boots. His body emitted golden rays of light, like a small golden sun.</p><p>Lion City, one of the five Giants!</p><p>Someone recognized the young man.</p><p>The lion City came from the Overlord, the lion Tiger Hall. It was a demon race, and it was rumored that its true form was a Golden Lion. It had 90% of the bloodline of the divine beast, the divine Sun Lion, and was extremely powerful.</p><p>Almost 90% of his bloodline had become a pure-blood Sun Divine Lion.</p><p>However, in the divine wilderness continent, there were almost no connate pure-blooded divine beasts. Those demon sovereigns only became pure-blooded after they broke through to the sovereign realm and underwent a transformation. However, this was a postnatal cultivation. There was still a huge difference between them and connate pure-blooded divine beasts.</p><p>“Lion Capital, let’s go together!”</p><p>As soon as Shi du walked out, another young man in a five-colored feather coat also stepped out.</p><p>Everyone’s heart jolted as they recognized this young man.</p><p>Kong Lin, the Supreme talent of the Overlord force and the myriad demon mountain. It was said that he had 90% of the bloodline of the divine beast five elements Peacock and was extremely powerful.</p><p>They were also two of the five Giants of central continent.</p><p>Of the five Giants of central continent, three were humans and two were demons.</p><p>“Kong Lin!”</p><p>Shi du looked at Kong Lin and grinned.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other and moved almost at the same time.</p><p>A five-colored ray of light and a Golden ray of light each charged towards a path.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Without any pause, a light flashed past. Just like dark Child, the spirit God existences blocking their way were directly blasted apart. They didn’t stop them in the slightest.</p><p>In an instant, the two of them appeared on the opposite platform.</p><p>the five magnates are really amazing!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>This was the strength of the five magnates. Compared to them, ordinary heaven’s favorites were far too weak.</p><p>Even many of the second-grade heaven’s favorites felt powerless.</p><p>“I’m coming!”</p><p>A Buddhist name that Lu Ming was very familiar with rang out. A baby-faced monk, who had been smiling all along, stepped out.</p><p>“This unscrupulous monk!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>“Amitabha!”</p><p>A clear Buddhist chant sounded. A petite figure in white clothes stepped forward and came to the road beside the unscrupulous monk.</p><p>“A female Bodhisattva!”</p><p>“What a beautiful female Bodhisattva!”</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>It was actually a nun. She was petite and dainty, wearing a pure white Kasaya. Her body was filled with Holy Buddhist light, like a female Bodhisattva who had walked out of a painting.</p><p>She was very beautiful. Even without her long black hair, she was still unparalleled and Holy. People couldn’t move their eyes away from her after one look.</p><p>it’s a pity that such a beautiful woman, no less beautiful than the five great beauties, is actually a female Bodhisattva. Sigh!</p><p>Many people sighed with regret.</p><p>“Hehe, the two bald donkeys of the Western Desert are about to attack, let me accompany you!”</p><p>With a sneer, a black-robed young man covered in black flames stepped out and appeared on the other road.</p><p>Someone recognized him as one of the southern netherworld’s chosen.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>On the other side, two tall figures stepped out at the same time, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>Yang potian and Tuoba Shi of Northern Plains!</p><p>haha, it’s really lively. I’ll go then!</p><p>The monk laughed as Buddhist light emanated from his body. With a flash of light, he charged forward.</p><p>At the same time, the others also moved. They turned into rays of light and rushed forward. On the way, the figures of the spiritual gods were practically non-existent.</p><p>In the next moment, on the opposite platform, yang potian, Tuoba Shi, the unscrupulous monk, the female Bodhisattva, and the young man covered in black flames all arrived at the same time.</p><p>Almost everyone was shocked.</p><p>“This … How was this possible? There are so many heaven’s favorites from the five magnates?”</p><p>Many people gasped and stuttered in disbelief.</p><p>Yang potian had long been one of the five Giants of the central continent. No one was surprised by this.</p><p>As for Tuoba Shi, he had fought with yang potian several times and his name had long spread throughout the central continent. As for the unscrupulous monk, his performance in the secret realm of the sage mansion of the world College had also spread, and everyone also regarded him as a heaven’s pride on the level of the five Giants.</p><p>These three people were as expected.</p><p>However, the female Bodhisattva and the young man covered in black flames were also so powerful. It was shocking.</p><p>don’t tell me these two people also have the strength of the Big Five. How can we compete then? the top ten spots are almost taken up!</p><p>Many people sighed.</p><p>First, it was dark Child, then Lion Capital, Kong Lin, and this time, there were five people. With such unfathomable existences, there were a total of eight people. There were not many spots left.</p><p>Then, many second-grade heaven’s favorites started to step out.</p><p>Now, almost all of the second-grade geniuses had stepped into the spiritual God Realm. This test was naturally not difficult for them.</p><p>The second-grade heaven’s favorites all passed by.</p><p>Lu Ming saw goddess Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, Kong Xin, Jun Yue, divine Emperor, and some others that he did not recognize.</p><p>This time, most of the divine wilderness continent’s elites were here.</p><p>Other than a few heaven’s pride experts from the imperial family and the Xie family, most of the heaven’s pride experts had participated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
