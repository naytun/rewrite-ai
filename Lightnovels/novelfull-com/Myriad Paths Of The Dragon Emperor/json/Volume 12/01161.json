Let me kill him!”</p><p>“Let me cripple him and let him taste the most painful punishment in the world!”</p><p>The imperial family’s Xie clan’s people shouted in anger, releasing cold killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xie nianjun’s body exploded with a shocking aura. Her beautiful eyes were filled with killing intent. The powerful aura pressed down on Lu Ming as she said in a cold voice,”Lu Ming, saving your life back then was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. But it’s fine. It’s the same if I kill you today!”</p><p>“You? It might not be enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave a contemptuous smile.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s cultivation was very strong. He was at the peak of the third level of the spiritual God Realm. His aura was powerful and his body contained a terrifying amount of energy. Lu Ming felt that he was even stronger than Dark Child.</p><p>If Lu Ming were to fight her during the million-year sacrifice, he would not have the confidence to win.</p><p>But now, he didn’t care about Xie nianjun.</p><p>Hmph, Lu Ming, don’t think that you’re the best in the world just because you defeated Dark Child. If I had made a move back then, I would have been able to suppress you!</p><p>Xie nianjun took another step forward. His aura was powerful, and his body glowed with a milky white light, making him look even more Holy and Noble.</p><p>“Could it be that Xie nianjun is going to fight Lu Ming?”</p><p>Many people’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>In the million-year National sacrifice, Lu Ming had defeated many powerful figures in a row, showing his invincible attitude.</p><p>In the end, when he faced Long Chen, Lu Ming admitted defeat directly. Many people regretted that they did not see who was the strongest.</p><p>Xie nianjun did not take part in that battle. This caused many people to discuss in secret, comparing Xie nianqing and Lu Ming to guess who was stronger.</p><p>After all, Xie nianqing was ranked second among the five Giants of central continent, second only to Long Chen. He had never fought anyone before, so it was hard to tell who was stronger.</p><p>Was the battle finally about to begin?</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. Then, he waved his hand and a ray of light flashed. Xie nianqing appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>Just now, Xie nianqing had sent a message to Lu Ming through dandan, saying that he wanted to come out. Lu Ming had let Xie nianqing out.</p><p>“This is …”</p><p>Xie nianqing attracted everyone’s attention the moment he came out.</p><p>In the sacred city, almost everyone’s eyes fell on Xie nianqing, and then on Xie nianjun. They were shocked because the two were too similar.</p><p>why does this woman look so similar to Xie nianjun? they are both devastatingly beautiful. Who is she? ”</p><p>I know. It’s said that the current Sage Emperor has three princesses, all of whom are peerless in their generation. Among them, the sixteenth Princess has been hidden by the royal family because she was born with a foreign bloodline. This girl should be the sixteenth Princess!</p><p>it should be. The three princesses of the current Sage Emperor are truly devastatingly beautiful. This sixteenth princess’s beauty is not inferior to the five great beauties at all. I wonder how her martial arts talent is? ”</p><p>A wave of discussion came from the surroundings.</p><p>Many people had long heard of the name of the sixteenth Princess, but not many had actually seen her in person, so they were naturally surprised.</p><p>so, you really did leave the abyss demon territory with him. Now, surrender and go back to the abyss demon territory. Stay here and hunt The Fiend clan for the rest of your life. Don’t even think about wandering outside and embarrassing the royal family!</p><p>Xie nianjun looked at Xie nianqing coldly.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s face was cold as he stared at Xie nianjun. “Xie nianjun, you don’t have to put on that arrogant face. You’ve been loved by everyone since you were a child and you’ve been surrounded by halos. What a joke! Today, I’m going to stomp you under my feet and let the world see how weak your so-called holiness and so-called orthodoxy are!”</p><p>As Xie nianqing’s voice rang out, endless demonic Qi surged from her body and her powerful aura clashed with Xie nianjun’s.</p><p>“If you want to fight me, then I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Xie nianjun said coldly. A milky-white pillar of holy light rose from his body. At the same time, a black demonic Qi rose from Xie nianqing’s body.</p><p>One black and one white, the two beams of light collided in the air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The clouds in the sky were scattered, and a strong wind swept through.</p><p>“Let’s go up and fight!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said as he flew into the sky.</p><p>Xie nianjun’s eyes were cold as he too flew into the sky. One black and one white, the two light shadows collided and tore the space into pieces.</p><p>“Sky Devil force field!”</p><p>“Nine Heavens Holy domain!”</p><p>Two delicate yells rang out as the two of them displayed their unique skills and fought in the air. In the blink of an eye, they had exchanged more than a dozen blows.</p><p>The attacks of Xie nianqing and Xie nianjun were very similar, but one was of the demonic Dao, while the other was of the Holy Dao.</p><p>Black Lotus flowers appeared around Xie nianqing and turned into Lotus swords.</p><p>As for Xie nianjun, milky-white lotus flowers appeared around him. They also transformed into sword radiances and fought with Xie nianqing.</p><p>The sword Qi soared into the sky and the light was bright. For a moment, the two were locked in a fierce battle.</p><p>the spectators all took in a cold breath and were extremely shocked.</p><p>she’s so strong! The sixteenth Princess is so strong! She can actually fight with the ninth Princess!</p><p>that’s scary. It turns out that the princess sixteen, who has been hidden all this time, is also a peerless talent. She’s too strong. She’s definitely a heaven’s favorite at the level of a giant!</p><p>the royal family’s generation is really full of talents. It’s rare to see two giants in one sect!</p><p>“I really don’t get it. A heaven’s favorite with unparalleled talent like him is being suppressed by the imperial family and the Xie clan. If any other power had a heaven’s favorite like him, they would do everything they could to nurture him. He’d be an unrivaled Emperor in the future!”</p><p>The sound of discussion spread out, especially into the ears of the imperial family’s Xie family. It was exceptionally harsh.</p><p>“Hmph, what’s the use of a mutant’s talent? He should be suppressed, forever suppressed, or else he’ll be a traitor!”</p><p>Xie Zhen coldly snorted. He gritted his teeth in his heart, but there was a trace of fear in his eyes.</p><p>Xie nianqing was too talented. The more talented he was, the more afraid he was and the more he wanted Xie nianqing to die.</p><p>As he mulled over this, Xie Zhen’s gaze fell on Lu Ming. It was all because of Lu Ming. He had no idea what method Lu Ming had used to save Xie nianqing from the abyss Demon Realm.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I advise you to surrender. You won’t be able to escape today. Surrender and I’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>Xie Zhen said, killing intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>alright, you can make your move. If you can take one of my moves, I’ll surrender!</p><p>Lu Ming said contemptuously.</p><p>“You … Don’t be so arrogant!” Xie Zhen angrily rebuked.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll take you down. There’s no need for the eighth prince to do anything. I’ll kill you!”</p><p>A middle-aged brawny man stepped out. He had a powerful aura and his eyes were cold.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that this was an expert at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>“Alright, venerable Xu, capture Lu Ming for me and you’ll be heavily rewarded!”</p><p>Xie Zhen was overjoyed as he said.</p><p>The brawny man was the royal family’s venerable Guardian. He was powerful and had a cultivation of the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm. If he were to take action, Lu Ming would be taken down with a hundred percent certainty.</p><p>“You want to make a move? fine, get over here and accept your death!”</p><p>Lu Ming said contemptuously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
