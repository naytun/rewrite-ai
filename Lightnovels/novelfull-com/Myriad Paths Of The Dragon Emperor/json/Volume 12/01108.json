Their eyes were cold, and their bodies were filled with sword Qi and sword power.</p><p>haha, he really brought this upon himself. This lowly thing is dead for sure!</p><p>In the air, the eighth prince, Xie Zhen, sneered.</p><p>brat, you and everyone else in the law enforcement Hall should commit suicide. I’ll let this matter go. Otherwise, not only you, but your family and the forces behind you will not be able to escape punishment!</p><p>The old man who had spoken first continued to speak, his tone filled with superiority and unquestionable authority.</p><p>His gaze swept across tie Xing and the others, causing their hearts to turn cold and their faces to turn ashen.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming laughed and stomped his foot on Wu Cang’s face, causing him to scream in pain.</p><p>The corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he looked coldly at the old man from the heavenly Sword faction. “Guilty? Not pursue the matter? What a joke, what right do you have to pursue this? We’re the ones who should be held accountable.”</p><p>“A disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction killed someone in the sacred city for no reason. We, the law enforcement Army, enforce the law impartially and represent the current Saint Emperor in enforcing the law. Yet, your heavenly martial sword faction has come to the law enforcement Hall to kill. Not putting the current Sage Emperor in his eyes? Do you really think that there’s no one else in the royal family?”</p><p>The elder from the heavenly martial sword faction was shocked when he heard that. He looked at Wu Cang, who was still at Lu Ming’s feet, and his expression turned ugly.</p><p>Lu Ming had used the royal family and the sage Emperor to suppress them.</p><p>Even if they really did not care about the royal family, they could not say it out loud. After all, the ancient Saint dynasty was still in charge of the world.</p><p>Furthermore, they were still in the sacred city, within the core territory of the ancient Saint dynasty. No matter how arrogant the heavenly martial sword sect was, they had to be wary of them.</p><p>“Brat, what do I have to do for you to let them go?”</p><p>The old man who spoke first said coldly and glanced at Wu Cang and the others.</p><p>Wu Cang, a second-class heaven’s favorite, had the potential to become a Martial Emperor in the future. They could not afford to lose him. They planned to save Wu Cang first.</p><p>“Let them go? Fine, but since they have committed a crime, they should be punished. How about this, use raw stones to redeem them. Five hundred thousand raw stones for each of the three trash. Two million raw stones it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>As soon as he said that, the entire place burst into an uproar.</p><p>Extortion! This was blatant extortion! This puny commander of the law enforcement Army actually dared to extort an expert from the heavenly martial sword faction! He was simply blinded by wealth and audacious. He didn’t know what death was.</p><p>The three elders of the heavenly martial sword faction were also infuriated. Their eyes even turned red.</p><p>Even though they had lived for thousands of years, they had never met such a bold person. To think that he would try to extort them, the heavenly martial sword faction. He was simply courting death!</p><p>“Evil beast, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The elder who spoke first was so angry that he could not hold it in any longer. With a long howl, a terrifying sword Qi condensed and slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Fourth level of the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>The old man who attacked was a fourth level spiritual God Realm expert. His combat strength was several times stronger than Wu Cang’s.</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and a small fiery-red Pagoda appeared. Then, it rapidly grew in size.</p><p>This small Pagoda was the spirit weapon that Lu Ming had obtained from the Saint mansion’s Secret realm. After so many days of refinement, Lu Ming had already begun to refine it. The aura of the spirit weapon had also been completely concealed, and outsiders could not sense it at all.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to take this opportunity to test the power of the small Pagoda.</p><p>Anyway, there were countless tower-shaped spirit weapons in the world. Lu Ming was not afraid of being recognized. He just had to restrain his aura.</p><p>Lu Ming grabbed the tower and smashed it at the sword gleam.</p><p>With a loud boom, the sword gleam was destroyed. Lu Ming’s body did not even move.</p><p>“The Emperor spiritual weapon consumes too much true Yuan. I really can’t use much of its power!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He had consumed a large amount of essential core just now.</p><p>Even a Martial Emperor would be envious of an Emperor spiritual weapon, so it was normal for him to be unable to unleash its power.</p><p>He muttered as he put away the small Pagoda.</p><p>He was not satisfied, but the others were already shocked.</p><p>Lu Ming could even block the attack of a fourth level spiritual God Realm expert. He was too powerful.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was simply unfathomable in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Every time others thought that he had reached his limit, the strength he revealed was beyond everyone’s imagination.</p><p>you’re just a mere law enforcement Army. Your treasures are good, but let’s see how many moves you can block with just your treasures? ”</p><p>The elder from the heavenly martial Sword School shouted in anger, and his aura became even more astonishing. A sword light shot up ten thousand meters into the sky, and the sword power was vast and terrifying.</p><p>if the Tiger doesn’t show its might, it’ll think I’m a sick cat. Kill!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted as a long spear condensed in his hand. He pierced it through one of the disciples of the sky martial Sword School.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction screamed in pain as he was pinned to the ground by Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had told them in a thunderous manner that they should not think that he would not dare to kill.</p><p>“Give me the orirocks to redeem them. Otherwise, I’ll kill them all!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was very cold.</p><p>Lu Ming would not miss such a good opportunity to extort money.</p><p>Cultivating by purely absorbing the spiritual energy of the heavens and the earth was too slow. After such a long time, Lu Ming’s current cultivation was only at the middle stage of the second level of the spiritual God Realm. If he had a large number of origin stones to devour, his cultivation would improve rapidly. He was currently lacking resources.</p><p>In half a month’s time, the million-year National sacrifice would begin. The competition set by the sage Emperor would also begin. Lu Ming’s goal was to get into the top three.</p><p>The sage Emperor could agree to one condition for the top three.</p><p>However, it wasn’t that easy to get into the top three.</p><p>When yang potian and Tuoba Shi were in the Saint mansion’s Secret realm, their cultivation had already reached the peak of the second level of the spiritual God Realm. Now that a period of time had passed, it was very possible that they would make a breakthrough.</p><p>If a heaven’s favorite like yang potian had reached the third level of the spiritual God Realm, it would be more troublesome for him to defeat him.</p><p>Moreover, there were five such heaven’s favorites in the central continent and also the southern underworld. It would not be easy for the heaven’s favorites from the Western Desert to get into the top three.</p><p>However, if Lu Ming’s cultivation also broke through to the third level of the spiritual God Realm, he would have full confidence.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>“Evil creature, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing of a disciple from the heavenly martial sword faction had thoroughly enraged the three elders. A terrifying aura burst forth, and sword Qi soared into the sky. The murderous intent was extremely cold, as if winter had arrived.</p><p>The other two elders ‘auras were even more terrifying. They were stronger than the elder who had attacked earlier and definitely surpassed the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm. If such experts wanted to join forces, their auras would be too shocking.</p><p>“Law-enforcement flag, please!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly shouted.</p><p>“The law enforcement flag is here!”</p><p>In the law enforcement Hall, tie Xing carried a large flag and rushed out. Lu Ming took it and stuck it into the ground.</p><p>It was a ten-meter-long flag with a sword and a saber embroidered on it. They were extremely sharp, as if they were real swords.</p><p>However, the flag looked very old and was even covered in dust. One look and one could tell that it had not been used for a long time.</p><p>But as soon as this flag appeared, the Qi of the three elders from the heavenly martial sword sect in the sky suddenly stagnated. They didn’t attack, but looked at the flag with uncertain expressions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
