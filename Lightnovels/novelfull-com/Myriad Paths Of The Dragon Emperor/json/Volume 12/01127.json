It had three heads. Unless all three heads were chopped off or one head was pierced, it would only be heavily injured but not dead.</p><p>...</p><p>In the future, it would grow three more heads.</p><p>At this moment, the three-headed Hellhound looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, his killing intent surging like a tide. His blood-red hair fluttered in the wind, and even his eyes were bloodshot. He strode towards the three-headed Hellhound.</p><p>Although the slaughter intent in the third bloodline was only borrowed and couldn’t be combined with his own five intents, it could still work together to make it stronger.</p><p>The blood-red spear danced, forming a blood-red Storm of slaughter.</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound did its best to fight Lu Ming. However, after a few moves, its second head was pierced by Lu Ming’s spear and it was injured even more severely.</p><p>In the end, the Cerberus had no choice but to leave the platform and admit defeat.</p><p>The three-headed Hellhound had lost!</p><p>This commander, no, Lu Shaoqing, had defeated the lion Capital and the Cerberus, two powerful heaven’s favorites. This had shocked everyone.</p><p>At this time, the battle between Dark Child and moonless had also entered the final stage.</p><p>Although moonless was strong, compared to Dark Child, she was still one step behind. From the beginning, she was at a slight disadvantage, to the end, she was completely suppressed. After Lu Ming defeated the Cerberus, she had no choice but to admit defeat and leave the platform.</p><p>With the withdrawal of moonless, the top ten was born!</p><p>They were long Chen, yang potian, Tuoba Shi, the heartless monk, Ming Zi, Kong Lin, the divine Emperor, the sandalwood fairy, Jing kongling, and Lu Ming.</p><p>Entering the top ten meant that one could enter the ancient Sage emperor’s palace and study the insights of the past Sage emperors, laying down a Foundation for one’s journey to the emperor’s realm.</p><p>At this moment, apart from yang potian and Tuoba Shi, the others didn’t make a move and just watched each other.</p><p>“Brother Lu, thank you for your help!”</p><p>Fairy Tan Xiang and Jing kongling bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>“The two fairies are too polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming grinned and said forthrightly.</p><p>brother Lu, it’s all up to you now. Sister Kong Ling and I are already very lucky to be able to enter the top ten!</p><p>Goddess Tan Xiang said in a sweet voice. Then, she and Jing kongling floated back and left the platform.</p><p>The two of them admitted defeat just like that.</p><p>No one was surprised. It was all within their expectations.</p><p>It was already extremely lucky for goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling to be able to enter the top ten. With their true strength, it would be very difficult for them to enter the top ten.</p><p>It was already enough for him to enter the top ten and enter the ancient Hall. Retreating now was the wisest choice.</p><p>Only eight people remained on the platform.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a violent boom, yang potian and Tuoba Shi exchanged a blow and both retreated. They stood in two different directions and did not continue fighting.</p><p>The two of them had already exchanged hundreds of moves, and there was still no clear winner.</p><p>yang potian, I heard that you’re ranked third among the top five young warriors of the central continent. Xie nianjun is ranked second, and Long Chen is ranked first. Are they really stronger than you? ”</p><p>Said Tuoba Shi, his voice booming like a Bell.</p><p>“Why don’t you try it?”</p><p>Yang potian said.</p><p>“Hahaha, you don’t have to provoke me. But I really want to try!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi laughed before turning to look at long Chen.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Was Tuoba Shi going to make a move on Long Chen?</p><p>Everyone’s heart was filled with anticipation. Long Chen had not made a move just now. In fact, Long Chen had not made a move since the battle of Providence. Everyone was curious about how far Long Chen had progressed and how strong he was. Would they be surpassed by the other heaven’s favorites?</p><p>A look of anticipation flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. Long Chen gave him a strong sense of pressure. He also wanted to know how strong Long Chen was.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s steps caused the platform to buzz as he walked toward Long Chen. His aura was extremely powerful, and the mace in his hand buzzed along with Tuoba Shi’s emotions.</p><p>His muscles slowly bulged, as if they were filled with infinite strength.</p><p>In comparison, Long Chen was very ordinary. His temperament and appearance were ordinary, just like an ordinary youth in the crowd.</p><p>On the platform, everyone backed away and looked at Long Chen and Tuoba Shi.</p><p>Long Chen, everyone says that you are the number one in the central continent, or even the divine wilderness continent. I would like to give it a try!</p><p>Tuoba Shi stood in front of Long Chen and said in a low voice. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.</p><p>Northern Plains was a warlike place, and Tuoba Shi was even more so!</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have found yang potian and fought him as soon as he arrived in the central continent.</p><p>Moreover, because he had not defeated yang potian, he had repeatedly fought with yang potian. From this, it could be seen how warlike he was.</p><p>To him, there was no one who could match him in Northern Plains, he had never lost in the younger generation, he needed stronger experts to give him pressure, thus, he went to find long Chen.</p><p>“You can make your move!”</p><p>Long Chen spoke for the first time. His tone was calm, without any arrogance or arrogance.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could hear a kind of ‘Qi’ from it. It was an invincible and undefeatable Qi.</p><p>This was the kind of Qi that could only be obtained when one was extremely confident in themselves.</p><p>“Receive my attack!”</p><p>Tuoba Shi let out a long roar and his already burly body became even more burly. A terrifying beast’s roar came out of his body as the mace in his hand shone with a brilliant light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>die! Tuoba Shi took a step forward and charged at Long Chen, smashing his Mace down with the force of ten thousand catties.</p><p>Facing Long Chen, Tuoba Shi did not dare to be careless. He used all his strength.</p><p>Everyone’s expression turned grave. Tuoba Shi’s move was too terrifying, and no one could ignore it.</p><p>However, Long Chen’s expression was still calm. When Tuoba Shi’s Mace was about to hit him, a terrifying aura spread out from his body. His arm swelled rapidly and his muscles bulged. It was twice as thick as usual.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Long Chen threw out a punch. The punch pierced through the space, creating a long dark tunnel. The entire area shook. On the platform, Lu Ming and the others could feel a powerful force spreading toward them. They had to channel their cultivation to resist it.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Long Chen’s fist collided heavily with Tuoba Shi’s Mace, creating a terrifying boom. It was like a thunderclap in the sky.</p><p>This was a collision of power.</p><p>Then, everyone saw a figure retreating rapidly and continuously like a huge Cannonball, until he was out of the platform.</p><p>It was Tuoba Shi. He was sent flying out of the platform by Long Chen’s punch. His face was pale and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p>Si si …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>Tuoba Shi had been defeated by Long Chen with a single punch.</p><p>Tuoba Shi’s strength could be seen from his battle with yang potian just now. His strength was absolutely terrifying, and his strength was shocking. He suppressed the world, and his combat strength was no weaker than yang potian’s.</p><p>But now, he was sent flying by Long Chen’s punch and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>This kind of scene was seriously too shocking.</p><p>Central continent’s people were still fine, but Northern Plains, Southern nether, Western Desert, and Eastern barren’s people were even more shocked when they saw this.</p><p>He was too strong!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
