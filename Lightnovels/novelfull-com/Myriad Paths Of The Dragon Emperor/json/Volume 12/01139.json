They wanted to lock Lu Ming up in the abyss demon territory for the rest of his life.</p><p>...</p><p>What a ruthless and brilliant method.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body exuded a cold killing intent, causing the thin elder to shiver.</p><p>“We’ll talk about everything after we find little Qing!”</p><p>Lu Ming heaved a long sigh of relief and retracted his murderous intent.</p><p>“Senior, do you know the whereabouts of the sixteenth Princess, Xie nianqing?”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming asked the question that he wanted to ask the most.</p><p>The demon Realm of Tartarus was too big, and it was no different from looking for a needle in a haystack. This old man had been here for many years, so he might know something.</p><p>“The sixteenth Princess? Are you talking about the princess with the Royal bloodline?”</p><p>The skinny old man said.</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>I have some impression of her. The sixteenth Princess was exiled to the abyss demon territory three years ago. When she first came here, her cultivation was still weak, so she stayed in the periphery of the abyss demon territory for a while. Later, she stayed in this city for a whole year. I’m quite familiar with her!</p><p>sigh, it’s a pity that the royal family treated such a rare and proud daughter of heaven like that. What do you want from her? ”</p><p>The skinny old man said. He let out a long sigh as if he was feeling sorry for Xie nianqing.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.”I’m her friend. Senior, do you know where she is now?”</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>The skinny elder shook his head. the royal family asked the sixteenth Princess to have the same amount of points as you. She asked for 10000 points. That’s why she left this place and went deep into the abyss Demon Realm after her cultivation improved!</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>The old man’s words made Lu Ming clench his fists tightly. The killing intent in his heart could no longer be suppressed and burst out.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was very uncomfortable!</p><p>His killing intent towards the royal family, Xie Zhen, and Xie Qitian was extremely strong.</p><p>They were going to lock Xie nianqing up in the abyss demon territory for the rest of his life.</p><p>Especially three years ago, when Xie nianqing’s cultivation base was only at the spiritual ocean tier, they had locked him up in the abyss demon domain. One could imagine how much he had suffered and encountered danger in the past few years.</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming’s heart was in pain.</p><p>But now, Xie nianqing had already entered the depths of the demon Realm. Where was he?</p><p>Lu Ming’s thoughts drifted and he only calmed down after a long time.</p><p>“Senior, you can take these raw gemstones!”</p><p>Lu Ming gave the skinny old man a storage ring, which contained tens of thousands of raw stones. Then, he soared into the sky and left the city, heading toward the depths of abyss demon territory.</p><p>There were also days and nights in the demon Realm of Tartarus.</p><p>During the day, there was a Dark Sun hanging in the sky. At night, there was a Blood Moon in the sky.</p><p>Moreover, when the Blood Moon was in the sky, the demonic Qi between heaven and earth would be extremely dense. At that time, The Fiend clan and demonic beasts would be stronger, while the human clan would be suppressed.</p><p>The Blood Moon hung high in the sky, and the demonic Qi was vast and mighty. However, it did not affect Lu Ming much. The nine Dragon bloodline burst out, and the rolling demonic Qi was devoured and refined into essential core in a flash.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at high speed, deep into the abyss demon territory.</p><p>There would definitely be more human warriors in the abyss demon territory. There must be other places where humans gathered in the depths of the abyss demon territory. Lu Ming planned to find out more about the human gathering place.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A sharp sound pierced through the air. A few black figures whizzed over and charged toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The three fiend clan members were all extremely ferocious. They held bone spikes in their hands and charged at Lu Ming at a terrifying speed. Their auras were also very powerful.</p><p>These were three first level spiritual God Realm demons.</p><p>The Blood Moon hung high in the sky. It was extremely dangerous to walk in the abyss demon territory, because many of the Mosha clan would move out, and demons would dance in chaos.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared, and the devouring power enveloped the three fiends. They couldn’t move at all, and their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Then, the nine Dragons devoured the energy and blood essence of the three demons, turning them into three dried corpses.</p><p>The nine Dragons had advanced to the eighth level of the divine level, and their devouring power had undoubtedly become even stronger.</p><p>After killing the three first level spiritual God Realm demons, the Jade token finally changed. A number appeared on it: Three!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered coldly. Killing a first level spiritual God Realm demonic Sha clan member would only earn him one point.</p><p>Compared to the terrifying 10000 points, what was the use?</p><p>Lu Ming continued to move toward the depths of the abyss demon territory. In a short while, the blood essence of the three first level spiritual gods was completely refined by Lu Ming.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s current cultivation, the energy and blood essence of the first level spiritual God Realm were naturally of no use to him.</p><p>In this way, Lu Ming advanced for three consecutive days.</p><p>Along the way, he encountered more than a dozen attacks. There were attacks from the devil clan and the demonic beasts here, but there weren’t many that were above the spirit God Realm. Most of the attacks he encountered were from the spirit embryo realm.</p><p>In three days, Lu Ming had crossed thousands of mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Die! The human race!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>A sharp voice rang out in front of him. Lu Ming could tell that it was the voice of the Mosha clan.</p><p>Following that, a series of rumbling sounds came from ahead. It was clear that an intense battle had taken place.</p><p>Lu Ming did not hesitate and flew toward the source of the sound.</p><p>It had been three days, and they were finally going to meet humans again.</p><p>On a mountain range, seven or eight Mo Sha clansmen were attacking a middle-aged man.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s cultivation was extremely profound. He was at the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, and he was fighting against seven or eight of The Fiend clan.</p><p>However, the seven or eight demons were all experts. The weakest among them was at the second level of the spiritual God Realm. The others were at the third level of the spiritual God Realm, and one was at the fourth level.</p><p>The large man was at a disadvantage with so many of The Fiend clan members joining forces. He could only block and not fight back.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The burly man fought back with all his might, killing a second level spiritual God Realm Mosha Clansman with a single blow of his axe. However, his back was also slashed by a fourth level spiritual God Realm Mosha Clansman’s bone spur, causing blood to flow out.</p><p>He mustered up all his strength and broke out of the encirclement, fleeing forward. Behind him, the other Mo Sha clan members were chasing after him.</p><p>The direction that the middle-aged burly man was running in was Lu Ming’s direction.</p><p>The middle-aged man saw Lu Ming after flying for a distance.</p><p>“Little brother, let’s go!”</p><p>The middle-aged man shouted.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stood in the air, motionless.</p><p>little brother, let’s go! There are experts from the devil clan behind us!</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming did not move, the middle-aged man shouted again anxiously.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a faint smile. This middle-aged man was kind enough to remind him to leave. If it were an ordinary person, he would have used Lu Ming as a shield to buy himself some time.</p><p>“It’s just a few Mo Sha clansmen, there’s no need to escape!”</p><p>With a smile, Lu Ming’s Nine Dragons bloodline emerged and the devouring power erupted with a loud bang, enveloping the entire Mosha clan. Then, under the middle-aged man’s horrified gaze, the bodies of the rest of the Mosha clan quickly withered, except for the fourth level spiritual God Realm. In the end, they lost their vitality and turned into mummies.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a snap of Lu Ming’s fingers, a ray of spear radiance flew out and killed the fourth level spiritual God Realm Mosha clan member. His blood essence and energy were also devoured by the nine Dragons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
