When such a terrifying amount was added together, the value was also very huge.</p><p>The royal family and the Xie clan had also put in a lot of effort and capital for this sacrificial ceremony.</p><p>Obviously, the royal family had been preparing for this for a long time. Otherwise, it was impossible for them to take out such a large amount of spirit wine and spirit pills at once.</p><p>In the air, the people of the major forces watched with faint smiles.</p><p>Not long after, the pills in the gourds were all poured out. The strong men and women carried the cauldrons and gourds and flew back to the palace.</p><p>After that, young girls carrying all kinds of delicacies and wine flew out of the palace and placed them in front of the people of the major forces.</p><p>hahaha, today marks the 100000th year since the establishment of the Holy dynasty. Thank you all for coming here and spending this day with me. Come, let me toast you all!</p><p>Xie Qitian picked up his wine cup and drank with the various major forces.</p><p>Following that, Xie Qitian continued, ” I believe everyone has heard of it. I have the intention to choose a young man to be my daughter’s husband. Furthermore, all the talents from the divine wilderness continent’s five territories have gathered here. Let’s have a competition.</p><p>no matter if it’s a woman or not, she can participate. The first place winner will become nianlin’s husband. Of course, if the woman wins first place, nianlin’s husband will be pushed back by one place!</p><p>“At the same time, I promise to fulfill one of the conditions of the second and third place winners. As long as it’s within my means, I’ll do anything I can. In addition, I’ll be allowed to enter the Saint-Emperor’s ancient Hall to meditate and cultivate!”</p><p>“Those ranked fourth to tenth will also be able to enter the ancient Saint Emperor Hall!”</p><p>“They’re here!”</p><p>As soon as Xie Qitian said that, many people’s eyes lit up. The most anticipated segment of the day had finally arrived.</p><p>Xie Qitian’s offer was too tempting, and not many people could resist it.</p><p>Today, all of the divine wilderness continent’s elites were gathered together. There would definitely be an exciting battle.</p><p>The battle of Providence had taken place in the ancient city of Providence, and not many people had seen it. As such, not many people knew how exciting it was.</p><p>But today, he could see it.</p><p>Moreover, not only were the heaven’s favorites from central continent here today, the heaven’s favorites from Southern nether, Western Desert, Northern Plains and Eastern barren were all gathered here and there would be an even more brilliant spark.</p><p>Most importantly, many of the top geniuses had entered the spiritual God Realm and were about to fight for the most powerful position in the spiritual God Realm. This was undoubtedly something that everyone looked forward to.</p><p>Especially many Young heaven’s favorites, they were all rubbing their fists, ready to show off their skills.</p><p>“Brother Xie, how should we compete?”</p><p>The Yin Yang Emperor of the yin-yang Palace asked.</p><p>there are too many heaven’s favorites here today. We can’t compete with them one by one. First of all, they have to be below 30 years old. Then, they have to pass a round of selection. Only those who pass the selection can enter the official competition!</p><p>let’s go, ” Xie Qitian said. With a wave of his hand, 18 paths formed by rainbow light appeared in the South of the platform. They spread out in a fan shape and were hundreds of miles long.</p><p>To the North of the platform, there were tables and chairs on the East and West sides, and they were all filled with people. Only the south side of the platform had always been empty. Xie Qitian must have had his plans in mind.</p><p>“The selection is very simple. Everyone who passes this path will be considered to have passed!”</p><p>Xie Qitian said.</p><p>“Passing through this path is considered a pass?”</p><p>The hearts of many moved as they looked at the 18 paths with grave expressions.</p><p>Since it was a selection, it definitely wouldn’t be that simple. There would definitely be obstacles on the way.</p><p>“Those who want to participate, enter through that door!”</p><p>With a wave of Xie Qitian’s hand, a huge door appeared at the end of the 18 paths. From the imperial family’s side, experts flew towards the door and stood guard on both sides.</p><p>Only by entering that door could one participate in the selection.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“I’m going!”</p><p>Instantly, young figures flew out from the major forces.</p><p>There were also young figures flying out of the sacred city towards the door.</p><p>“Haha, this commander is leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled at tie Xing and the rest.</p><p>“You … You’re going too? Commander, the sage Emperor said that only those below thirty years old can participate. How old are you?”</p><p>Tie Xing and the rest looked at Lu Ming with suspicion.</p><p>Lu Ming had a full beard. No matter how one looked at him, he did not look like he was below thirty years old. He was at least close to forty years old. Furthermore, martial artists aged very slowly. Lu Ming’s actual age could be hundreds of years old.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to participate. If he was caught making up the numbers, he would not be able to bear the consequences.</p><p>hey, what’s with your expressions? I’m not even thirty years old!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at tie Xing and the rest in disdain. Then, he strode towards the big door.</p><p>“No… No… Not even thirty years old?”</p><p>Tie Xing and the dozens of law enforcement soldiers all had their eyes wide open and their mouths wide open. Their jaws were almost dislocated, and it was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Lu Ming swaggered to the main entrance.</p><p>At this moment, there was already a long line at the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming stood in line at the back.</p><p>“Then … Who was that? That big-bearded man, he’s already so old, but he’s still going to line up?”</p><p>“Isn’t that the overpowered commander? What was he doing? Didn’t you hear the sage Emperor say that only those under thirty can participate?”</p><p>this weird commander is really audacious. Just wait and see. He’ll definitely be chased away later.</p><p>Some people noticed Lu Ming and immediately started to discuss.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with the gazes from the surroundings. He lined up leisurely.</p><p>Very soon, it was Lu Ming’s turn.</p><p>“Stop, what are you doing here? Hurry up and run!”</p><p>A burly man who was guarding the door stopped Lu Ming.</p><p>“What are you doing? I’m here to take part in the competition!”</p><p>Lu Ming glared at him.</p><p>“A competition? The sage Emperor has ordered that no one above thirty is allowed to participate. How old are you? How dare you ignore the sage Emperor’s orders! You’re courting death!”</p><p>The burly man shouted angrily, his aura overbearing.</p><p>“Haha, this weird commander is finished. He dares to ignore the sage Emperor’s order!”</p><p>The commotion here naturally attracted the attention of everyone present.</p><p>nonsense! Which eye of yours saw that I’m over 30 years old? let me tell you, I’m not even 30 yet. I’m just a little older. Don’t judge a book by its cover!</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>This stunned many people, and then they burst into laughter.</p><p>Lu Ming did not look like he was under thirty years old. He was definitely over thirty years old.</p><p>This guy was clearly trying to sneak in.</p><p>Many people thought so.</p><p>“You, get out of my way! Don’t block the way!”</p><p>A cold voice came from behind Lu Ming. It was a woman’s voice. It was pleasant to the ears, but it was cold and arrogant.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw a devastatingly beautiful woman. She was tall and slender, and her beauty was unparalleled. She was not inferior to deity Tan Xiang, Jing kongling, and the others.</p><p>that’s Liu Yuxin, one of the five great beauties of central continent!</p><p>Some people were discussing and looking at Liu Yuxin excitedly.</p><p>“So it’s Liu Yuxin, one of the five great beauties of central continent!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he could not help but take a few more glances.</p><p>Liu Yuxin was indeed very beautiful. She was devastatingly beautiful, like a dream. Just from her appearance, she was not inferior to the likes of goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
