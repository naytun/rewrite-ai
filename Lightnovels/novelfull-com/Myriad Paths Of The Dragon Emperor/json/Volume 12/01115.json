They were clearly Liu Yuxin’s flower guardians.</p><p>...</p><p>Standing in the middle of the three flower guardians, Liu Yuxin was like a myriad of stars surrounding the moon. She was extremely cold and arrogant. She glanced at Lu Ming indifferently, her eyes revealing a slight disdain, like a proud White Swan.</p><p>“Big beard, What are you looking at? Are you even looking at Yuxin?”</p><p>why don’t you take a piss and look into the mirror? you’re already so old, yet you still want to sneak in and compete. Don’t tell me you still want to marry Princess nianlin? you’re really a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. Hurry up and get lost!</p><p>Beside Liu Yuxin, a few young men chided her one after another, acting all high and mighty.</p><p>These few people had obviously come to the holy city later and did not know about Lu Ming’s impressive achievements.</p><p>“Where did these wild dogs come from? don’t they know the rules and keep barking? I’m here first, so I haven’t entered yet. You guys line up for me, understand?”</p><p>Lu Ming glanced at the few of them indifferently, his eyes filled with contempt.</p><p>“You … What did you just say? You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>The young men’s faces were ghastly pale. They berated him one after another. If not for the fact that they could not fight here, they would have killed Lu Ming long ago.</p><p>Liu Yuxin’s expression was very ugly and gloomy. Clearly, Lu Ming’s words just now had included her in his scolding.</p><p>“This piece of trash doesn’t respect the sage Emperor’s orders. He’s clearly older than the Emperor, but he still wants to sneak in. I suggest that we kill him immediately as a warning to others!”</p><p>A red-robed young man was the most arrogant.</p><p>“What if I’m not older than him?” Lu Ming gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p>“If you’re not over 30 years old, I’ll immediately kneel down and eat dirt!”</p><p>The red-robed young man shouted. He took a closer look at Lu Ming and was even more certain that Lu Ming’s age could not be lower than thirty.</p><p>“Alright, I request to test my bone age!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted loudly, his voice spreading far and wide.</p><p>“Approved, let him take the test!”</p><p>A dignified voice was heard. It was Xie Qitian.</p><p>The sovereigns had naturally seen everything that had happened here.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>An old man flew out from beside Xie Qitian. With a wave of his hand, a mirror appeared.</p><p>“This is the bone measuring mirror. It can measure the age of your bones!”</p><p>The old man explained. Then, a beam of light shot out from the bone-measuring mirror and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, almost all eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming was really not even thirty years old? That’s impossible. He looks almost forty, but his actual age must be even older.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the bone measuring mirror trembled and 25 round wheels appeared. They shone with a golden light and filled the sky.</p><p>This was a bone wheel, and one wheel represented one year.</p><p>On the bone-measuring mirror, a round wheel of twenty-five appeared, representing Lu Ming’s age. He was only twenty-five.</p><p>Moreover, the twenty-fifth wheel was not very bright. This meant that Lu Ming was still a little away from turning twenty-five.</p><p>The scene quieted down at once. Everyone looked at Lu Ming in bewilderment, their jaws almost dropping to the ground.</p><p>nest, he’s not even 25 years old. This awesome commander is actually not even 25 years old. How is this possible? ”</p><p>he looks like he’s almost 40. He’s growing too fast!</p><p>“It’s really painful to the eyes!”</p><p>“He’s not even twenty-five years old. Doesn’t that mean he belongs to the younger generation? He suppressed Wu Cang before!”</p><p>The scene was in an uproar, but after the last sentence, the scene suddenly fell silent.</p><p>That’s right, he was less than 25 years old and belonged to the younger generation. The key was that he had suppressed Wu Cang.</p><p>If Lu Ming was in his thirties or forties, or even older, and he had suppressed Wu Cang, it would not be a big deal. After all, he had been cultivating for many years. However, Lu Ming was in his twenties and was younger than Wu Cang. It was a different story.</p><p>This meant that this overpowered commander was a rare heaven’s favorite, one that was even stronger than Wu Cang.</p><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. This awesome commander was too awesome and really exceeded everyone’s expectations.</p><p>It was not that no one had thought that Lu Ming was someone else in disguise. However, if he wanted to join the law enforcement Army, he had to go through an identity check. He could change his appearance, but could his aura be changed too?</p><p>“This damned guy!”</p><p>Inside the door, Wu Cang naturally saw this scene. He immediately gritted his teeth and wanted to bite Lu Ming.</p><p>Some people from the heavenly martial sword faction also had ugly expressions on their faces. They had suffered a great loss at the hands of this commander.</p><p>Some of the sovereigns ‘eyes sparkled as they sized Lu Ming up curiously.</p><p>“Nest, the commander … He’s only twenty-five years old?”</p><p>Tie Xing and the others were completely stunned.</p><p>If the bone measuring mirror had not measured Lu Ming’s bone age, they would still find it hard to believe.</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, Liu Yuxin and the other young men’s eyes almost popped out. The red-robed young man in particular almost bit his tongue off.</p><p>“Can I go in now?”</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the burly man who was guarding the door.</p><p>“Can … You can enter, haha!”</p><p>The burly man guarding the door smiled awkwardly.</p><p>“And you, what did you say just now? If I’m not even thirty years old, you’ll have to kneel and eat dirt. Let’s start now!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze fell on the red-robed young man as he said coldly.</p><p>“This … That … I was just casually saying it, casually saying it!”</p><p>The red-robed young man’s face turned red in embarrassment.</p><p>“Your mother’s fart!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared and glared at the young man. The beard on his face stood up and a powerful aura burst out, enveloping the young man in red. He scolded,”What do you think this place is? All the emperors are here, and the sage Emperor is on your seat. You actually dare to speak so casually in front of all the sage emperors? what do you take all the emperors for? Is this the person you’re joking with? I think you want to die!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s every word was like a huge hammer pounding on the red-robed young man’s heart, causing his face to turn pale and bloodless.</p><p>“No, I didn’t. You’re talking nonsense. I didn’t disrespect the emperors!”</p><p>The red-robed young man shook his head repeatedly, cold sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>you’re still denying it? then do as you say. If you don’t do it, I’ll teach you!</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. He moved and appeared in front of the red-robed young man all of a sudden. He pressed his big hand on the red-robed young man’s shoulder.</p><p>This red-robed youth was a third-grade heaven’s favorite with a cultivation of great circle spirit embryo. He was worlds apart from Lu Ming and had no power to resist at all. Lu Ming pressed him down and he fell to the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After landing on the ground, the red-robed young man knelt down.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming pressed his head down on the ground. With a bang, the red-robed man’s face smashed into the ground, causing it to shatter and his mouth to be full of dirt.</p><p>Gulu!</p><p>Many people in the surroundings suddenly swallowed their saliva and stared at Lu Ming with wide eyes.</p><p>This awesome commander was really too overbearing. He really made the red-robed young man eat dirt. He really meant what he said.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>On the west side of the platform, an old man from a large force slammed the table and shouted angrily.</p><p>This force was cold-blood Hall, and the young man in red was one of its elites.</p><p>Many cold-blood Hall members glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Don’t be impatient!”</p><p>Standing at the front of cold-blood Hall was the hall Master, blood Emperor. He spoke indifferently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
