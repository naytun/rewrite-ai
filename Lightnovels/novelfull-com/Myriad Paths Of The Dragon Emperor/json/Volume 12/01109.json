The flag of law enforcement!</p><p>...</p><p>“The law enforcement flag created by the ancient Saint Emperor in the ancient times!”</p><p>The crowd began to discuss, and many people’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>The flag of law enforcement was created in the ancient era when the ancient Saint Emperor established the law enforcement Army. It was used to enforce the law in the world.</p><p>30,000 years ago, wherever the law enforcement flag passed, no one wasn’t terrified. Its deterrent force was monstrous.</p><p>However, after the war 30000 years ago, the ancient Saint dynasty was weakened and the law enforcement Army was useless. The law enforcement flag lost its power and it had been many years since anyone used the law enforcement flag.</p><p>However, at this moment, the appearance of the law enforcement flag still made people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>“Do you think you can stop us by taking out the law enforcement flag? You’re really naive. You’ll die today!”</p><p>An elder shouted and stepped forward. With every step, sword Qi filled the air and cut open the space.</p><p>This was an existence that surpassed the fourth level of the spiritual God Realm, or even beyond the fifth level of the spiritual God Realm. He was too powerful.</p><p>How dare you! The flag of law enforcement is here. We are the law enforcement Army. By setting up the flag of law enforcement, we represent the ancient Saint dynasty, the royal family, and the Saint Emperor. The heavenly martial sword sect is completely disrespecting the royal family and the Saint Emperor. Is the heavenly martial sword sect trying to rebel? are you trying to destroy the royal family and replace the Xie clan? ”</p><p>Lu Ming stood up straight and pointed the long spear in his palm at Wu Cang’s back. He shouted loudly.</p><p>His words swept through the entire area like a storm, causing the three elders of the heavenly martial Sword School to look extremely grim.</p><p>Lu Ming had made a big mistake.</p><p>He directly accused them of wanting to rebel and destroy the imperial family and the Xie family.</p><p>Although the heavenly martial sword faction really had such thoughts, could they say such things out loud? Moreover, the heavenly martial sword sect didn’t have the strength to do so.</p><p>“Tianwu sword faction, you have the ambition of a Wolf. You look down on the imperial family and the Imperial power. Today, the eighth prince is here, and you want to rebel in front of him, look down on the Imperial power and the Xie family? How could the eighth prince tolerate you?”</p><p>At the end of his sentence, Lu Ming cast his gaze at Xie Zhen.</p><p>Lu Ming had long discovered Xie Zhen.</p><p>The other people also looked at the eighth prince.</p><p>Xie Zhen’s face fell and he cursed Lu Ming a thousand times in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming was using him as a shield.</p><p>But what could he do in this situation?</p><p>Lu Ming took out the flag of law enforcement. The flag of law enforcement was created by the ancient Sacred Emperor back then. His ancestor was equivalent to the face of the Royal Xie family.</p><p>Lu Ming was a member of the law enforcement Army, and he enforced the law on behalf of the sage Emperor. If the heavenly martial sword sect were to make a move on Lu Ming, or even kill him, it would be a slap to the face of the imperial family and the Xie family. To put it more seriously, it would be a rebellion.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Lu Ming had dragged him down with him again. If Xie Zhen ignored him in front of everyone, he would not be able to bear the consequences if this news spread to the royal family, the Xie family, and even the sage Emperor.</p><p>Moreover, there were more than a dozen princes, and they were not very harmonious. They fought openly and secretly. If he did not handle it well today and embarrassed the royal family, the other princes might use this to attack him.</p><p>At the thought of this, Xie Zhen gritted his teeth. He could not wait to cut Lu Ming.</p><p>“Eighth prince, am I wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming continued to ask.</p><p>“Well said!”</p><p>In the end, Xie Zhen gritted his teeth and descended from the sky. He stood beside Lu Ming and faced the three elders from the heaven martial sword sect. He said unwillingly, this time, commander Ming Lu is right. This time, it was the disciples of the heavenly martial sword sect who committed the crime first. The law enforcement Army will handle it impartially and protect the face of our imperial family!</p><p>After he finished speaking, Xie Zhen’s heart felt even more disgusted than if he had eaten a dead rat.</p><p>He was aggrieved. He was simply too aggrieved.</p><p>What was his purpose in transferring Lu Ming to the law enforcement Army? wasn’t it to let Lu Ming offend the people from the big forces and be killed by the powerful people from the big forces with one slap?</p><p>But now? He had achieved the initial effect, but the later stage was completely different from what he had expected.</p><p>Not only was Lu Ming not killed, but he even had to step in personally to protect Lu Ming.</p><p>What the hell is this?</p><p>He was aggrieved. He hated Lu Ming so much that he gritted his teeth and almost broke them.</p><p>“The eighth prince is right. He is indeed an outstanding talent of the royal family. If you three old fogeys want to kill me today, you will have to step over the eighth Prince’s dead body first. Come on, come at me if you have the ability!”</p><p>Lu Ming clamored.</p><p>Xie Zhen almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>What did he mean by “if you want to kill him, you have to step over the eighth Prince’s dead body”? Xie Zhen was so angry that he almost vomited blood. However, he could not back down at this moment.</p><p>He could only grit his teeth and stare at the three elders from the heavenly Sword faction.</p><p>In the eyes of others, Xie Zhen had a kind of righteous and fearless spirit. They did not know that it was all because he was angered by Lu Ming.</p><p>The three elders from the heavenly martial sword faction looked gloomy and unsightly.</p><p>The eighth prince, Xie Zhen, was not like Lu Ming, who could be killed easily.</p><p>Xie Zhen was the current Saint Emperor’s son, and they were in the holy city. If they really dared to kill Xie Zhen in front of everyone, it would definitely cause the imperial family’s Xie clan to take revenge, and they could forget about leaving the holy city.</p><p>In the crowd, there were also many law enforcement soldiers who had come from other law enforcement halls to watch the show. At this time, their blood was boiling, and their hearts were extremely comfortable.</p><p>All these years, the people of the law enforcement Army had been too cowardly and aggrieved.</p><p>He lived worse than a dog.</p><p>When those people from the major forces committed a crime, they still had to take raw stones and treasures out to ask the other party to admit their mistakes. How were they going to live their days?</p><p>Now, when they saw this scene, they really had a feeling of exaltation.</p><p>It was really too good!</p><p>“Law enforcement Army, law enforcement flag, the current Saint Emperor will enforce the law!”</p><p>One of the burly men roared as he stepped into the air. A large flag suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p>Law-enforcement flag!</p><p>At this moment, another law enforcement soldier from the law enforcement Hall held a law enforcement flag and stuck it beside Lu Ming’s flag. He stood beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“The law-enforcing Army is the law-enforcing Army on behalf of the sage Emperor, the law-enforcing Army!”</p><p>Another group of people shouted and rushed out, standing behind the burly man.</p><p>They were all from another law enforcement Hall, and there were more than a hundred of them.</p><p>“Haha, that’s right, the law enforcement Army. The current Saint Emperor will enforce the law!”</p><p>Another person laughed and rushed out. Another law enforcement flag appeared and was placed in a row with the first two.</p><p>“Haha, I’m here too!”</p><p>“Law enforcement!”</p><p>With loud roars, law enforcement troops appeared one after another. Law enforcement flags appeared and were planted in a row.</p><p>In the end, there were a total of nine law enforcement flags, which were inserted in a row, fluttering in the wind.</p><p>The law enforcement Hall from all directions in the holy city had come. They took out their law enforcement flags and wanted to advance and retreat with Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Nearly a thousand people stood behind Lu Ming and Xie Zhen, glaring at the three elders from the heavenly martial sword faction in the air.</p><p>Usually, they would swallow their grievances, but today, they would risk it all.</p><p>The surrounding crowd looked at this scene in shock.</p><p>It had been many years since the nine law enforcement flags were raised. Today, it was happening again because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Now, let’s see what the heavenly martial sword faction will do.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Xie Zhen roared in his heart. However, in this situation, he could only hold on.</p><p>The three elders from the heavenly martial sword faction had gloomy expressions. They had not expected that things would develop to this stage. Right now, they were in a dilemma.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
