The sacred city was even more lively, and there were more and more people.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s days did not change. Other than cultivating, he would bring his people to stroll around the holy city.</p><p>“Eh? This mansion is so strange. It’s covered in dust, but it’s sealed by a large array of inscriptions!”</p><p>In the northeast of the holy city, Lu Ming led his group for a stroll and came to a huge mansion.</p><p>This mansion was very old and majestic. It occupied a large area, but it was obviously uninhabited and sealed by a large formation. This was rare in the holy city.</p><p>“Lord, lower your voice. This mansion is a taboo!”</p><p>On the side, Sun Lin’s face was solemn as he whispered, as if it was a taboo.</p><p>“Forbidden? I’m curious, tell me about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Sun Lin hesitated and stammered.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face darkened.</p><p>alright, commander, I’ll tell you through voice transmission. This is because this mansion is the mansion of the chaotic heavens divine warrior, Xie Luan.</p><p>Sun Lin sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Xie Luan, the divine warrior of the chaotic heavens? The chaotic heavens divine warrior who caused the chaos in the ancient Saint dynasty 30000 years ago?”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the chaotic heavens divine warrior’s mansion!”</p><p>Sun Lin said.</p><p>“Oh, Sun Lin, you seem to know a lot about the chaotic heavens divine Emperor. Then do you know why he betrayed the imperial family and the Xie clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“This … Lord Commander, I’ve also read about it in an ancient book by chance.”</p><p>it’s said that Xie Luan, the chaotic heavens divine warrior, is an anomaly in the Xie family. The Royal Xie family has a noble bloodline, and the bloodline that they awaken is pure and holy. However, there is a very small chance that someone will awaken a bloodline that is completely different from others. It’s the complete opposite, an extremely dark bloodline. Such a person is called an anomaly by the Royal Xie family, and will be looked down upon and ridiculed!</p><p>when the chaotic sky sovereign was young, he grew up in all kinds of mockery and bullying, so he was filled with hatred towards the Royal Xie family. However, the chaotic sky sovereign’s talent was terrifyingly strong. The more bloodlines he awakened, the more terrifying his talent became. He was simply unparalleled in the world, so he was later valued by the Royal Xie family and entrusted with an important task.</p><p>after that, the chaotic heavens divine warrior even broke through to the divine realm. His combat strength was extremely terrifying, and he was able to suppress the other divine warriors. At that time, the chaotic heavens divine warrior finally erupted. He led his subordinates and started a rebellion. They fought the royal family and the Xie family until the heavens and earth fell. Although the chaotic heavens divine warrior was suppressed in the end, the ancient Saint dynasty suffered great losses in that battle. Countless spirit gods and Supreme-beings died, and even many divine warriors died. From then on, their strength was greatly weakened, and the other forces took the opportunity to split up. To form the current situation!”</p><p>Sun Lin told Lu Ming about the records he had read.</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>The experience of the chaotic heavens divine warrior was so similar to that of Xie nianqing. The bloodline that he awakened was called an anomaly by the Royal Xie family.</p><p>It was just a bloodline, yet he treated it like this. It was simply ridiculous.</p><p>Xie Luan, the sovereign of the chaotic heavens, had unparalleled talent. If no one had laughed at him or humiliated him when he was young, why would he have rebelled after he had become powerful?</p><p>If not for the betrayal, the Xie family of the ancient Saint dynasty would not have ended up where they were today.</p><p>I’ve heard that the current sixteenth Princess has also awakened a mutated bloodline. Sigh, what a pity. The other members of the royal family have always looked down on mutated bloodlines. After the incident with the chaotic sky Emperor, the fate of those with mutated bloodlines has become even worse.</p><p>before the appearance of the chaotic heavens divine warrior, if any of the royal family’s variant bloodlines revealed their Supreme talent, the royal family would still nurture them, just like the chaotic heavens divine warrior. However, after the chaotic heavens divine warrior appeared, any of the variant bloodlines would be directly suppressed. The stronger the talent, the more they would have to suppress it. It’s simply a taboo, because they’re afraid that another figure like the chaotic heavens divine warrior would appear!</p><p>Sun Lin continued.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but clench his fists.</p><p>No matter what, he had to save Xie nianqing. No matter how difficult it was, he had to go through it.</p><p>Thereafter, Lu Ming left the place and did not ask further.</p><p>Time passed, and soon, there was still half a month to go before the million-year National sacrifice.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s cultivation had also progressed and he had reached the middle stage of the second level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>it’s too slow. It’s too slow to rely on absorbing spiritual energy to improve cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>However, he had no choice. He did not have many raw gemstones on him. The amount of raw gemstones he needed to increase his cultivation in the spiritual God Realm was simply terrifying.</p><p>However, the will of heaven and earth and the will of water had broken through and reached the fourth level lower tier. Now, only the will of earth had not broken through to the fourth level lower tier.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming had just ended his cultivation and was about to go out for a walk when someone came to inform him that something had happened. Someone had killed someone on the street and the battle was still ongoing.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I heard that he’s a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction!”</p><p>Tie Xing replied with an ugly expression.</p><p>The heavenly martial sword faction was an Overlord force, and an extremely powerful one at that.</p><p>What should he do now?</p><p>They knew that as the various overlords gathered in the sacred city, something would happen.</p><p>“What do we do? Of course, we’ll handle it fairly!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Fair and just? Commander, the other party is the heavenly martial Sword School!”</p><p>Tie Xing called out worriedly.</p><p>“What’s wrong with the heavenly martial sword sect? Don’t forget, this is the holy city, not the heavenly martial sword faction. You guys, follow me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and strode out. The others had no choice but to follow.</p><p>They stepped on the air and flew, and soon arrived at the scene of the incident, outside a restaurant.</p><p>At this moment, the restaurant was already surrounded by people.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the sky and looked down.</p><p>On the street, there were two people lying on the ground, blood flowing all over the ground. Their throats had been slit by a sword, and they had long since stopped breathing.</p><p>On the other side of the two corpses, the battle was still going on.</p><p>Three white-robed disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction were attacking three people.</p><p>An old man and two young men and women.</p><p>However, these three people were no match for the three disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction.</p><p>The three sky martial sword faction disciples were all fifth level spirit embryo realm experts. They were very young and belonged to the younger generation.</p><p>To have such a cultivation at this age, he was obviously one of the top geniuses of the heavenly martial sword sect.</p><p>As for the old man and the two young ones, the old man’s cultivation was at the seventh level of the spirit embryo realm, but the young man and woman’s cultivation was only at the first or second level of the spirit embryo realm. The difference was too great.</p><p>Although the old man’s cultivation was profound, the three disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction were all top-notch heaven’s pride experts. It was common for them to fight above their level. They completely suppressed the old man and didn’t have the power to fight back.</p><p>hehe, you’re really looking for death. How dare you talk about the heavenly martial sword sect behind our backs!</p><p>One of the disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction sneered.</p><p>“Your heavenly martial sword sect is too overbearing. You don’t even allow others to chat? Wu chengkong and the others were killed by Lu Shaoqing in the secret realm of the Saint mansion of the Tianxia Academy. It’s a fact that the whole world knows. Are you going to kill everyone in the world?”</p><p>The young woman said stubbornly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
