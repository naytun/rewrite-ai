He didn’t look like anything special, but since everyone had taken the initiative to keep a distance from him, no one would go up and attack him.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites of the Big Shot level were still Lion Capital and Kong Lin.</p><p>The two of them scanned the second-grade heaven’s favorites with cold eyes.</p><p>This was especially so for Shi du. His cold eyes were filled with killing intent as he swept his gaze across Lu Ming from time to time.</p><p>The remaining second-grade heaven’s favorites were all on guard against each other, pulling apart the distance.</p><p>brother Lion, brother Kong, I have a suggestion. Why don’t we join forces and take down all these people? then, there will only be ten of us left on the field!</p><p>Wu chengkong suggested as he walked toward the lion City.</p><p>Then, he swept his gaze across all the second-grade geniuses, including Lu Ming.</p><p>The second-grade heaven’s favorites ‘expressions changed.</p><p>There were nine heaven’s favorites at the top level. Including Wu chengkong, there were ten of them.</p><p>Wu chengkong’s intention was obvious. He would sweep everyone off the platform and secure a spot in the top ten.</p><p>Shi DU’s and Kong Lin’s gazes flickered, and they also swept across everyone.</p><p>“Alright, we’ll do as you say!”</p><p>Shi du said.</p><p>The lion Tiger Hall had a good relationship with the heavenly Sword faction, and the lion City had a good relationship with Wu chengkong. That was why he agreed to Wu chengkong’s suggestion.</p><p>There was also another reason. It was also beneficial for them to have ten people left on the field earlier.</p><p>The heaven’s favorites of the big shots would definitely start a competition. However, if they fought now and one of them was defeated, wouldn’t they fall out of the top ten and be taken advantage of by the second-grade heaven’s favorites?</p><p>If they were able to secure a spot in the top ten, they would be able to fight to their heart’s content. Even if they were defeated, they could still enter the ancient Hall to comprehend.</p><p>Kong Lin clearly thought of this point too. His gaze flickered, and he said, ” “I also agree!”</p><p>alright, Kong Lin, then let’s join forces first and clear up these trash!</p><p>Shi du sneered, his eyes cold.</p><p>The second-grade heaven’s favorites all had ugly expressions.</p><p>“Wu chengkong, you’re despicable!”</p><p>damn it! Everyone, I suggest that we join forces. Otherwise, we will all be defeated!</p><p>alright, I agree. Let’s join forces!</p><p>A few second-class heaven’s favorites spoke one after another. With a flash, six second-class heaven’s favorites gathered together. They planned to fight Shi du, Kong Lin, and Wu chengkong together.</p><p>However, goddess Tan Xiang and Jing kongling didn’t go with them. The two peerless goddesses gathered together and retreated to the side.</p><p>In addition, the Emperor God didn’t join them. He moved back in a flash.</p><p>Of course, it was impossible for Lu Ming to gather with them.</p><p>“You guys, why aren’t you coming over? do you want to be defeated by them one by one?”</p><p>A young man glanced at di Shen and Lu Ming and shouted coldly.</p><p>“I don’t need you to worry about me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Hmph, you’re so stubborn. You think you have some strength and you’re so proud. Let’s see how you lose!</p><p>The young man berated Lu Ming. He was rather unhappy that Lu Ming did not join them.</p><p>“Do it!”</p><p>Shi du spoke and stared at Lu Ming first.</p><p>“Brother Lion, you don’t need to attack this guy. I’ll take him down!”</p><p>Wu chengkong said, his eyes fixed on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good. The sage Emperor just said that we can’t kill him, but that’s only what we can’t do. You know what to do, right?”</p><p>Shi du pondered for a moment and nodded.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll break all his limbs and bones. I’ll make sure he won’t be able to get out of bed for half a year!”</p><p>Wu chengkong smiled hideously.</p><p>Now that he had broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm, his combat strength had greatly increased. He was full of confidence and did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>He took a few steps forward and the sword Qi around him whistled as he approached Lu Ming.</p><p>how dare you hurt the hero of my Heavenly Sword faction! I’ll let you know the consequences!</p><p>Wu chengkong’s voice was cold. His eyes were sharp like swords.</p><p>scumbag of the heavenly Sword faction, it seems that you have not learned your lesson. This time, I will make sure you learn your lesson!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes glinted coldly. He took a step forward and threw a palm at Wu chengkong.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The sword Qi let out a long cry. Wu chengkong unsheathed his sword and the sharp sword Qi slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>His cultivation had broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm, and his combat strength was much stronger than when he was in the Saint mansion’s Secret realm. The sword Qi cut through the void and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck Wu chengkong’s sword Qi and destroyed it. At the same time, he continued to attack.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The palm landed on the sword, and a loud boom was heard. The sword kept shaking. Wu chengkong felt as if he had been hit by an ancient mountain. He felt a terrible force surging toward him, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>Wu chengkong roared. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>He was actually forced back by Lu Ming’s palm.</p><p>He was already at the top among the second-grade prodigies. Now, he was ahead of the other second-grade prodigies and was the first to enter the second level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was so strong that he was almost unrivaled under the big shots. However, he was forced back by Lu Ming’s palm. This was unacceptable to him.</p><p>The surrounding spectators were also shocked.</p><p>The bearded commander’s combat power was beyond expectations. Could he really rival or even defeat Wu chengkong?</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this time, Shi du and Kong Lin had already made their move. The two of them displayed terrifying combat power and launched a storm of attacks on those six second-grade heaven’s favorites.</p><p>Although the six second-grade heaven’s favorites tried their best to defend, they were still at a disadvantage. This showed how powerful a heaven’s favorite is.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and the entire platform rumbled. His essential core surged and he used the prison suppressing heaven technique. His every move contained terrifying power.</p><p>He appeared in front of Wu chengkong in an instant. He turned his palm into a fist and threw a few punches.</p><p>The punch carried boundless power. The sky shook and groaned as if it could not withstand Lu Ming’s punch.</p><p>“How can he be so strong?”</p><p>Wu chengkong was terrified. He exerted all his strength and slashed out shocking sword Qi continuously. However, all of them were suppressed and crushed by Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>Lu Ming’s momentum was unstoppable. Wu chengkong kept retreating. His body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Burst! Burst!”</p><p>As Wu chengkong retreated, he activated his bloodline power and transformed into a sword.</p><p>However, it was useless. Lu Ming’s fist was too brutal and suppressed everything.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>After seven punches, Wu chengkong’s sword exploded. His body reappeared, spitting blood and looking pale.</p><p>He had lost. Wu chengkong had lost!</p><p>This result was beyond the expectations of many people.</p><p>Although Lu Ming had defeated Wu Cang previously, Wu Cang was considered weak among the second-grade geniuses. Wu chengkong, on the other hand, was a top second-grade genius and had already broken through to the second level of the spiritual God Realm. His combat strength was much stronger than Wu Cang’s.</p><p>In the beginning, no one thought that Lu Ming could be a match for Wu chengkong.</p><p>“This commander of the law enforcement Army is really unexpected!”</p><p>Some of the older generation sighed.</p><p>As for tie Xing and the others, the corners of their mouths twitched, and they were already numb.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
