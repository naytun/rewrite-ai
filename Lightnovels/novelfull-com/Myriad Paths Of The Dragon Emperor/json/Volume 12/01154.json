The heaven’s secrets instrument was still operating but it could not sense Lu Ming’s projection? What kind of treasure does this guy have that can isolate the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument?”</p><p>...</p><p>generally, treasures with internal spaces can’t isolate the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument. Could it be that Lu Ming has a treasure of a higher grade than the heaven’s secrets instrument? ”</p><p>Some people guessed, and the flames of greed in their eyes burned even more.</p><p>If they killed Lu Ming, not only would they be rewarded with a priceless tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure from the royal family, but they would also be able to obtain the treasures on Lu Ming. This made everyone’s hearts burn with a fiery flame.</p><p>“There’s a reaction, the array board is reacting!”</p><p>Suddenly, someone shouted.</p><p>there’s really a reaction. The projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument has reappeared. Lu Ming has appeared. He’s still in this area!</p><p>“Tens of thousands of miles to the South. Let’s go!”</p><p>One figure after another felt the reaction of the array board in their hands and rushed to the South.</p><p>However, after a few breaths, these people stopped again.</p><p>“What’s going on? The formation plate’s reaction has disappeared again!”</p><p>“What the hell? You should die!”</p><p>At this moment, these people’s disk arrays had lost their connection to the projection of the heaven’s secrets instrument.</p><p>I don’t care. He’s in the South!</p><p>Many experts flew in the direction that they had sensed earlier. Very soon, many people appeared near the lake where Lu Ming had transmitted into the underground and began to search.</p><p>there are so many people here. The Royal Xie family, heavenly martial Sword School, cold-blood Hall, Ji family …</p><p>In the crowd, a dark-skinned burly man looked around with a cold light in his eyes.</p><p>This person was Lu Ming.</p><p>Previously, he had changed his appearance and rushed out of the ground. Not long after, he discovered a large number of experts approaching. He took the opportunity to mix in with these experts and inquire some information.</p><p>Lu Ming had changed his aura using the illusionary breath technique. These people could not recognize him at all. Lu Ming had successfully obtained a lot of important information.</p><p>the Royal Xie family is really willing to take out a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure. However, it’s understandable. The chaotic sky Emperor has reappeared. The Royal Xie family is probably already panicking!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>“Senior, since there are so many tonics here, why don’t we find an opportunity to get rid of some?”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Xie Luan.</p><p>haha, that’s just what I want. Let’s leave this place first and look for those who are alone!</p><p>Xie Luan laughed heartily, his voice ringing in Lu Ming’s ears.</p><p>The experts here searched the surroundings. After not finding Lu Ming, they scattered.</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the crowd and followed behind the few powerhouses from the heavenly Sword sect.</p><p>Of the three experts from the heavenly martial sword faction, two were at the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, and one was at the sixth level.</p><p>After flying for a distance, the three of them stopped and turned to look at Lu Ming.</p><p>“This brother, what are you trying to do by following the three of us?”</p><p>One of the seventh level spiritual God Realm experts asked, his gaze somewhat cold.</p><p>They had long sensed that Lu Ming was following them. However, the aura that Lu Ming revealed was only at the third level of the spiritual God Realm. They did not care at all. However, after being followed for such a long distance, they also revealed killing intent in their hearts.</p><p>“Haven’t you been looking for me?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and his voice became younger.</p><p>The three of them were stunned for a moment, then their eyes lit up.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming?”</p><p>One of them coldly shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Three sword hums resounded and three sword lights shot into the sky.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on them. He charged forward.</p><p>At the same time, Xie Luan also appeared and pounced at his opponent.</p><p>After Xie Luan absorbed two experts in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm, his strength had recovered a little. It was even easier for him to deal with martial artists in the seventh level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>Four sealing gates appeared, instantly freezing the three experts of the heavenly martial Sword School.</p><p>Lu Ming killed one of them with a single palm strike. The other two were killed by Xie Luan before they were enveloped by the rolling demonic Qi.</p><p>Three storage rings flew out toward Lu Ming, who grabbed them and kept them.</p><p>After a few breaths, the three experts from the heavenly Sword faction had disappeared. The demonic Qi on Xie Luan’s body grew even more powerful and churned.</p><p>The muscles all over Xie Lun’s body squirmed and were filled with demonic radiance. He was like a Supreme demonic god, exuding a terrifying aura.</p><p>it’s so comfortable. My Immortal demonic body has recovered a little, but it’s still far from it. Let’s continue!</p><p>A demonic light flickered in Xie Luan’s eyes, as if an unparalleled demonic god was about to awaken.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded without any hesitation.</p><p>Now, he was in the same boat as Xie Luan. The stronger Xie Luan was, the more advantageous it would be for him.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming left the place and set his eyes on two cold-blood Hall experts.</p><p>The two seventh level spiritual God Realm experts were easily killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>The hunt continued. No one would notice Lu Ming’s disguise.</p><p>Lu Ming specifically chose those who were alone or in groups of two or three to attack, but they were all easily killed by Xie Luan and became his nourishment.</p><p>Many experts had come to this region. They came from various Overlord forces and even some of the forces that were one level lower.</p><p>Of course, not all the forces had come. For example, the heaven suppressing divine Army, the biggest enemy of the royal family and the Xie family, had no one come.</p><p>Also, xuankong mountain and Tianxia Academy didn’t send anyone.</p><p>Apart from a few Overlord forces that had not sent anyone, Lu Ming discovered people from ten Overlord forces.</p><p>Lu Ming did not show any mercy. He led Xie Luan and hunted them down one by one.</p><p>Slowly, Xie Luan’s strength grew stronger and stronger. From being able to kill a seventh level spiritual God in the beginning, he was able to easily kill an eighth level spiritual God later on, and then to a ninth level spiritual God.</p><p>Three hours later, the effect of the sealing door was over. Lu Ming found a secret place and asked Xie Luan to help him seal it again.</p><p>hu hu …</p><p>Demonic Qi churned. After Xie Luan absorbed a ninth level spiritual God Realm expert, the demonic Qi in his body reached a terrifying level, especially his demonic body. It was like a demonic weapon, revealing a terrifying aura.</p><p>Immortal demon body!</p><p>The sovereign realm was completely different from the spiritual God Realm!</p><p>An Emperor’s intent would transform into a domain, and their bloodline would condense into a spiritual body. Both of these were terrifyingly powerful.</p><p>A spirit body had already transcended the mortal body and had the power to destroy the world.</p><p>An Emperor could easily kill anyone below the Emperor level with just his spirit body, even without his territory.</p><p>Xie Luan’s immortal demon body was a kind of spirit body, a kind of overbearing and extremely powerful spirit body. Because Xie Luan had been suppressed by the fragment of the prison suppressing stele for 30000 years, his spirit body had almost collapsed, and he was now slowly condensing it back.</p><p>“Lu Ming, how about we do something big?”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes were filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>“A big one? How do we do it?”</p><p>Lu Ming was very tempted.</p><p>Although Xie Luan had killed many powerhouses and turned their flesh, vital essence, and blood essence into Xie Luan’s tonics, Lu Ming did not get a single piece of them. However, Xie Luan did not take the storage rings and gave them all to Lu Ming. Lu Ming was rich now, so he was naturally tempted.</p><p>“Using a formation to kill a group of people!”</p><p>Xie Luan slowly explained his plan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
