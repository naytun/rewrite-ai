A fierce battle was still going on.</p><p>Blood stained the entire divine mountain.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall was already stronger than the floating mountain sect. Plus, they had taken action quickly and occupied a large amount of Sky Eagle Castle territory. Many powerful existences in Sky Eagle Castle had surrendered to cold-blood Hall, so cold-blood Hall had completely suppressed the floating mountain sect.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A terrible roar came from the high sky. It was the battle between the two emperors of cold-blood Hall and the floating mountain. It was so intense that it was difficult to determine the winner.</p><p>The battle was even more intense in various parts of the floating mountain.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall and some experts from the sky Eagle Castle had more Supreme-beings than the floating mountain.</p><p>In terms of the number of sovereigns and advanced-stage spiritual gods, cold-blood Hall was superior to the floating mountain.</p><p>Gah! Gah!</p><p>In some parts of the floating mountain, the great formation had collapsed. Giant eagles were circling around and launching terrifying attacks. They were all experts from the sky Eagle Castle.</p><p>The sky Eagle Castle experts had just surrendered, so they were naturally eager to be put in an important position in cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“Ha ha, floating mountain martial school, let’s see how long you can last. Pure spatial spirit, after we break the floating mountain martial school, I will make you beg for mercy under my crotch!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi stood in the air, looking at the floating mountain and sneering.</p><p>Beside him, there were many experts.</p><p>This time, the blood Emperor of cold-blood Hall had given him a lot of power and a powerful Army to command. It was obvious that he wanted to train him and train him as his successor.</p><p>The blood-covered disciple was the future hope of the cold-blood Hall.</p><p>“Give me more strength and break the floating mountain. At that time, I will reward you according to your merits!”</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s voice came from afar.</p><p>His face was like a spring breeze, high-spirited, and full of pride.</p><p>The sky Eagle Castle, the Overlord force that had been fighting with cold-blood Hall, had still been destroyed by cold-blood Hall.</p><p>Yin BUPO, a powerful second-grade heaven’s favorite, was killed by master Xue Luo in the end.</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s strength had skyrocketed. Now, the floating mountain sect was about to be taken down. Blood Luo Zi could already see the scene of him becoming the Emperor and leading the experts of cold-blood Hall to conquer the central continent.</p><p>Jing kongling, Tan Xiang, Liu Yuxin, Xie nianjun, you are all mine. Sooner or later, I will take you all!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi continued to dream and imagine.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Deafening rumbles suddenly sounded between heaven and earth. It was as if thousands of savage beasts were stepping on the void.</p><p>The loud explosion interrupted Xue Luo Zi’s beautiful dream. His eyes turned gloomy and he shouted coldly, ” “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Young master Xue, there seems to be a large Army coming this way!”</p><p>An old man in a blood-red robe looked behind him with a serious expression.</p><p>“An Army? Which army is it?”</p><p>Cold-blood Hall’s heart sank as they asked.</p><p>“Demonic Qi soaring up to the sky, could it be the Army of the devil Mountain? that shouldn’t be the case, the devil Mountain can’t even take care of themselves right now, how would they have the strength to come here?”</p><p>The blood-robed elder frowned.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, the shaking sound became more and more intense, and the entire sky was shaking slightly.</p><p>The cold-blood Hall experts gathered a portion of their experts and set up a defense, watching from afar.</p><p>Gradually, demonic Qi filled the sky. In the endless demonic Qi, countless experts in black iron armor rode demonic beasts and rushed over. Finally, they stopped a thousand miles away from cold-blood Hall.</p><p>which force are you from? we’re from cold-blood Hall. Why have you come here? ”</p><p>Cold-blood Hall stepped out of the crowd and spoke first.</p><p>“I’m here to destroy your cold-blood Hall!”</p><p>let’s go! a voice said. Two figures stepped out and appeared in front of them.</p><p>“It’s you, Lu Shaoqing. No, Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s pupils contracted as he exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>It was Lu Ming and Xie nianqing who had stepped into the air.</p><p>The other cold-blood Hall experts also widened their eyes in shock.</p><p>A few months ago, in order to capture Lu Ming, the Xie family of the royal family activated the heaven’s secrets instrument, which shocked the entire central continent.</p><p>However, in the end, not only did they fail to capture Lu Ming, but a series of major events also happened.</p><p>It could be said that everything had started because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ming had appeared in the holy city, he had disappeared along with Xie Luan. He did not expect that he would appear again.</p><p>Lu Ming had appeared. Then, what about Xie Luan?</p><p>The cold-blood Hall members ‘eyes flickered with fear as they looked at Lu Ming’s group with a serious expression.</p><p>Xie Luan’s name was too great, and it frightened them.</p><p>“There’s no need to look, the chaotic heavens divine warrior isn’t here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you mean by that?”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi asked.</p><p>“Didn’t I just tell you? I’m going to destroy your cold-blood Hall. It seems that your ears are not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Destroy cold-blood Hall? Even if Xie Luan came here personally, he wouldn’t dare to say such a thing. The imperial family has long since spread the news that Xie Luan has been suppressed for thirty thousand years and has been injured to the point where he no longer has the might of an Emperor. Don’t think that we’re afraid of him, and besides, he hasn’t come yet!”</p><p>“Elder Yuan, go and cripple Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>A blood-robed elder released a terrifying aura and charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>A Paragon! This was a Paragon!</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Behind Lu Ming, a burly man with a giant axe in his hand stepped forward and slashed at the blood-robed elder.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, and their bodies trembled as they retreated.</p><p>“Paragon!”</p><p>Xue Luo Zi’s face darkened.</p><p>senior, I don’t know why you’ve been bewitched by Lu Ming, but it’s not good for anyone to go against cold-blood Hall because of this kid. Can you give cold-blood Hall some face and hand over Lu Ming? then, leave, and cold-blood Hall will reward you handsomely!</p><p>Xue Luo Zi cupped his fists at the burly man and said.</p><p>In his heart, he could negotiate terms for anything.</p><p>He speculated that these experts might be Xie Luan’s subordinates, but even if Xie Luan came personally, he could still negotiate the conditions.</p><p>He speculated that the reason why these demonic experts came with Lu Ming to attack cold-blood Hall was because Lu Ming had promised them something.</p><p>But could Lu Ming’s offer be compared to cold-blood Hall’s? Could Lu Ming’s value be compared to cold-blood Hall?</p><p>As long as he persuaded these demonic experts, it would be a matter of minutes for them to take down Lu Ming.</p><p>what an idiot! Young master Lu Ming is the Supreme Commander of our Army. He’s on the same level as the chaotic heavens demonic ancestor, and you’re asking us to hand him over? ”</p><p>The burly man waved the battleaxe in his hand and revealed a mocking smile.</p><p>“What? What? Supreme Commander? On an equal footing with the chaotic heavens divine Emperor?”</p><p>Blood Luo Zi and the others from cold-blood Hall were dumbfounded.</p><p>Lu Ming was the highest-ranking commander of these people and he was on the same level as Xie Luan. How was this possible? Lu Ming, what right did he have?</p><p>kill! Wipe out cold-blood Hall!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming waved his hand and gave the order.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
