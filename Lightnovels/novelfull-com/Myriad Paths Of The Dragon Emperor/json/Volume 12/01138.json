It’s not the time for the royal family to send people to hunt down the mo Sha clan yet. It seems that this person has offended the royal family and was exiled here.</p><p>he’s so young. Hehe, I’m afraid he’s a heaven’s favorite from some force. He must have a lot of money on him!</p><p>“Leave this person to me. I need raw gemstones!” He said.</p><p>“Bullsh * t, who doesn’t need raw gemstones? This kid is mine!”</p><p>Voices rang out all around as they stared at Lu Ming with burning eyes.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming heard these voices as well. He furrowed his brows and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>A burly figure rushed out with an angry roar. He raised his hand and slammed it down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The space trembled continuously and a powerful force surged toward Lu Ming. This was a first level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold as he struck out with his palm. His palm was like a heavenly blade, cutting into the man’s palm.</p><p>With a cracking sound, the man’s palm bone was broken by Lu Ming. He screamed and retreated frantically, looking at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>“This person has some skill. Let’s attack together!”</p><p>kill! someone shouted and seven to eight figures pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>These seven to eight figures were actually all spiritual God Realm experts.</p><p>Some were at the first level of the spiritual God Realm, while others were at the second level. The highest one was at the third level of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>The eight of them attacked at the same time, and the momentum was extremely shocking. All kinds of attacks covered Lu Ming’s entire body. If it were an ordinary third level spiritual God Realm martial artist, he would have been injured or even suppressed under the siege of so many experts.</p><p>However, how could Lu Ming be compared to an ordinary third level spiritual God?</p><p>Activating the prison suppression heaven art, he struck out Eight Palms in a row.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were eight explosions, followed by the sound of bones breaking and a series of screams.</p><p>The eight figures spat out blood and fell back, heavily crashing into the surrounding buildings.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was the first level, second level, or even the third level spiritual God Realm expert, they would all end up the same.</p><p>Lu Ming had shown mercy. Otherwise, they would have all died in one move.</p><p>Everyone in the surroundings gasped and looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>It was too terrifying. With just one move, he had severely injured all eight experts, including the third level spiritual God Realm. What kind of combat strength was this?</p><p>Moreover, he looked so young, which was even more unbelievable.</p><p>could it be a heaven’s favorite of the big shots outside? ”</p><p>Someone said with a trembling voice, causing everyone to shiver.</p><p>At this moment, no one dared to make a move.</p><p>Although there were several hundred people in this city, it was impossible for all of them to be at the spirit God Realm. In fact, most of them were at the spirit embryo realm, and there were only a dozen or so people at the spirit God Realm.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold gaze swept across the surroundings. When those people met Lu Ming’s gaze, their hearts trembled and they did not dare to look directly into his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared above the third level spiritual God Realm expert.</p><p>It was an old man with white hair and a thin body. He looked at Lu Ming in horror.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm contained a terrifying power, but it did not explode. He had a feeling that if it had, he would have been dead.</p><p>“Young hero, please spare my life! This old man was momentarily confused!”</p><p>The old man begged for mercy.</p><p>“Tell me, why did you attack me the moment I entered?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked coldly.</p><p>well, we were forced to do this. Young hero, you must have just entered the demon Realm of Tartarus, right? let me explain it to you in detail!</p><p>The thin old man sighed and began to explain in detail.</p><p>As it turned out, these people had offended the royal family, or they were people who belonged to the ancient Saint dynasty. Because of their mistakes, they had been exiled to the abyss Demon Realm and were forced to kill the Mosha clan to atone for their sins.</p><p>However, there were countless members of the Mosha clan in the demon Realm of Tartarus, and they were everywhere. It was very dangerous.</p><p>As for human warriors, they absorbed and refined the demonic Qi very slowly in the abyss demon territory. As time went by, the raw stones they brought would be used up. If they refined the demonic Qi too slowly, it would be very disadvantageous for them when they fought the devil clan.</p><p>Sometimes, it wasn’t them who hunted the devil clan, but the devil clan who hunted them instead. They had no choice but to gather together and build a city to resist the devil clan.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ming could see this small city.</p><p>And what was the most precious thing to The People of the Abyss Demon Realm? Of course, the raw gemstones were the most precious. Therefore, when they saw that Lu Ming had just entered the abyss Demon Realm, they were naturally greedy and wanted to take his raw gemstones.</p><p>To put it bluntly, they were just a group of pitiful people.</p><p>“All of you can leave now, I won’t make things difficult for you!”</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and dismissed the few people who had attacked, leaving only the old man behind.</p><p>The skinny old man had the highest cultivation level among them, so he should be the leader.</p><p>“Young hero, do you have any other orders?”</p><p>The skinny old man looked at Lu Ming, feeling a little uneasy.</p><p>To be honest, he had lived for so many years, but he had never seen such a terrifying young expert.</p><p>let me ask you, the reason why the royal family banished you here and ordered you to hunt down the mo Sha clan was to obtain points, right? once you have enough points, they will let you go, right? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right, that’s indeed the case. However, the points are just a scam!</p><p>The skinny old man gritted his teeth.</p><p>“A scam? What was going on? Why didn’t I get any points from killing the devil clan?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“Young hero, the royal family told you, how many points do you need to get out?”</p><p>The skinny old man asked.</p><p>“Ten thousand!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Ten thousand?”</p><p>The skinny old man’s eyes suddenly widened. He gasped and his face was full of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned, waiting for the elder to continue.</p><p>“Haha, young hero, in my opinion, the imperial family has no intention of letting you out. They want to lock you up here for the rest of your life,”</p><p>The old man said with a bitter smile.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>young hero, you still don’t know how to get points, right? let me tell you, killing a demon clan below the spiritual God Realm doesn’t give you any points. You can only get points by killing a spiritual God powerhouse or above.</p><p>killing a first level spiritual God will earn you one point. Killing a second level spiritual God will earn you two points. Killing a third level spiritual God will earn you three points, and so on. Killing a ninth level spiritual God will earn you nine points. Killing a perfected spiritual God will earn you ten points!</p><p>killing a Supreme-being from the Mosha clan will earn you 100 points, and killing an Emperor-level Mosha will earn you 10000 points!</p><p>The skinny old man explained.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Lu Ming clenched his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>He understood that he had been tricked. Xie Qitian, a dignified Sage Emperor, had actually lied to him.</p><p>According to this point conversion, how could he possibly obtain 10000 points?</p><p>Killing a first level spiritual God from the Mosha clan was only worth one point, while killing a perfected spiritual God was only worth ten points.</p><p>Even a Supreme-being from the Mosha clan only had 100 points. This meant that he would have to kill 100 Supreme-beings in order to accumulate 10000 points.</p><p>Also, an Emperor-level Mosha would give ten thousand points, but killing an Emperor-level Mosha?</p><p>Let’s not even talk about whether there was an Emperor realm Mosha clan in the abyss demon territory. Even if there was one, Xie Qitian might not be able to do it himself, so how could Lu Ming?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
