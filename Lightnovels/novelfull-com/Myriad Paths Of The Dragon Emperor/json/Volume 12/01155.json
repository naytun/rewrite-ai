It had reached the peak of the eighth rank, which was also the great circle of the spiritual God Realm.</p><p>He needed to find a place to set up a peerless formation and kill a group of experts.</p><p>This was especially true for great circle spirit God stage experts.</p><p>Lu Ming was in full support of the idea.</p><p>The two of them chose a hidden great canyon. This great canyon had a wide and magnificent view.</p><p>When Lu Ming arrived, Xie Luan began to inscribe the array.</p><p>In the beginning, an illusory formation was inscribed to conceal their figures and other formations.</p><p>After the illusory formation, it was the killing formation.</p><p>Xie Luan’s hands kept moving, and one inscription after another sank into the ground around the valley.</p><p>no, no, your formation is not powerful enough. It won’t be that easy to kill a great circle spiritual God expert!</p><p>On his shoulder, dandan stood on her two legs and watched Xie Luan carve the formation, looking like she was in charge of everything.</p><p>Xie Luan was a little curious. He looked at dandan, pondered for a moment, and said, ” this array of mine should be able to kill three great circle spiritual gods without any problems!</p><p>“Bullshit!”</p><p>Dandan put her hands on her hips and scolded him directly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This guy was berating Xie Luan like this. He was probably looking for a beating.</p><p>Xie Luan raised an eyebrow, and a powerful aura began to emanate from him. But a moment later, he retracted his aura.</p><p>Dandan was also shocked at first. She grabbed Lu Ming with her claws and waited for Xie Luan’s aura to subside before she secretly heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>let me tell you, although your formation can kill up to three people in the great circle of the spiritual God Realm, it will definitely take some time. If it doesn’t succeed in a short time and attracts the attention of Supreme-level experts, we can only run away!</p><p>Dandan continued to put on a smug look.</p><p>Xie Luan’s brows twitched. Dandan was right. His formation could indeed kill three great circle spirit God experts, but it would take some time.</p><p>kid, you’re still too young to play with formations in front of me. Let me teach you!</p><p>She arrogantly rushed out and began to wave her hands above Xie Luan’s formation. Runes began to appear, but they didn’t merge with Xie Luan’s runes, only marked them.</p><p>you can inscribe the inscriptions according to what I’ve inscribed. This way, the power of your array will double!</p><p>Dandan continued to inscribe as she muttered.</p><p>Xie Luan looked carefully and was surprised when he saw the back.</p><p>He found that the inscriptions that dandan pointed out and engraved were very wonderful. If they were supplemented into his array, it could indeed increase the power of his array by a large margin. It was more than enough to double the power.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this little turtle of yours is extraordinary. It has an unusual background!”</p><p>Xie Luan looked at Lu Ming, the surprise in his eyes deepening.</p><p>After a short period of interaction, he realized that he could not see through Lu Ming anymore. He had a big secret. Although his current cultivation was still weak, he had a bright future and it was difficult to predict.</p><p>“What little turtle? Little brat, I’m one of the top ten warbeasts!”</p><p>Dandan’s ears were very sharp, and she heard it from afar. She became even more proud and spoke to Xie Lian in a tone as if she was lecturing a junior.</p><p>“What? Top ten Battle Beasts? You’re one of the top ten Battle Beasts?”</p><p>Xie Luan’s eyes suddenly widened, a look of shock on his face.</p><p>“Senior, don’t listen to his nonsense. This guy just likes to brag!”</p><p>Lu Ming said hurriedly. He then pretended to be nonchalant and asked, ” “Senior, you know about the top ten warbeasts? What are the top ten warbeasts?”</p><p>I’m not too sure either. It’s just that when I left the divine wilderness continent and headed overseas, I heard of it once. It’s said that the top ten Battle Beasts are the ten most powerful living creatures in this world. Each one of them has the power to destroy the world. Emperors are like ants in front of them, and they can even easily kill Saints. It’s extremely terrifying!</p><p>there are even legends that some of the top ten Battle Beasts don’t come from our world, but from another world. It’s said that the original body of your nine Dragon bloodline is one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the nine Dragons!</p><p>“It can easily kill a Saint?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Also, some of them came from another realm. Lu Ming thought of heaven.</p><p>As dandan came from the heaven Gate, Lu Ming speculated that the other side of the heaven Gate was the heaven realm.</p><p>alright, I’ve added the necessary inscriptions. Kid, inscribe it according to the trajectory I’ve carved. The power of the formation will definitely increase by a large margin!</p><p>Dandan flew back and landed on Lu Ming again.</p><p>Xie Luan sized up dandan seriously, but didn’t say anything. He flew out and began to inscribe inscriptions according to the trajectory dandan had carved.</p><p>“Dandan, in the future, don’t mention that you are one of the top ten warbeasts in front of others!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan to remind her.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, it seemed that people did not know much about the top ten warbeasts. Even Xie Luan, the sovereign of the chaotic heavens, had only heard of them from overseas. This was still fine, as no one would pay much attention to him if he were to clamor all day long.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s cultivation level became stronger in the future and he broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, he would be targeted by others if he went overseas and made such a big fuss.</p><p>According to Xie Luan, the top ten Battle Beasts were existences that could easily obliterate Saints. That in itself was a Supreme treasure, and if others knew about it, how could they not be tempted and covet it?</p><p>“Alright, alright, I’ll stop talking!”</p><p>Dandan was very smart and had obviously thought of this as she muttered.</p><p>Xie Luan spent an entire day inscribing the formation. During this time, he would point out any shortcomings and Xie Luan would do as he was told.</p><p>A day later, the formation was completed.</p><p>After that, it was time to attract people over. However, first, they had to check if there were any Supreme-being level figures. If they attracted a Supreme-being level figure, not to mention killing others, even they would be in danger.</p><p>Lu Ming changed his appearance and strolled around the area, checking and asking around to see if there were any Supreme-being level figures.</p><p>After confirming that there were no Supreme-beings around, Lu Ming returned to the place where he had set up the array and waited quietly.</p><p>Soon, the energy of the sealing gate was exhausted, and the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection reappeared.</p><p>At that moment, everyone with a formation disk in a radius of a million miles reacted at the same time.</p><p>Light spots reappeared on the formation plate.</p><p>it’s Lu Ming. Lu Ming has appeared!</p><p>damn it, he has been appearing and disappearing from time to time during this period of time. Now he’s using this move again!</p><p>“He’s playing with us. If I catch him, I’ll skin him alive!”</p><p>Those powerhouses couldn’t hold back their anger and started to curse.</p><p>However, he still obediently charged in the direction indicated by the formation plate.</p><p>hey, this time, Lu Ming did not disappear. The array disc has been showing him!</p><p>if that’s the case, it would have disappeared a while ago, but it hasn’t disappeared yet!</p><p>I guess Lu Ming has used some method to hide the aura of the heaven’s secrets instrument’s projection. Now, he can’t hide it anymore!</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up as they rushed in the direction shown on the array disc.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
