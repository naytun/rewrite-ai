The Reaper’s harvest!</p><p>...</p><p>A cold and unpleasant voice was heard. The Grim Reaper’s scythes in the hands of the twelve Grim Reapers drew a mysterious and strange arc, slashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Twelve death God’s scythes were placed in all directions.</p><p>Dark Child, you are the one who is defeated today!</p><p>Lu Ming let out a long howl.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The next moment, a deafening Dragon’s Roar was heard. Nine Dragons appeared above Lu Ming’s head, and a vast Dragon’s might filled the air.</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a ray of light and entered the nine Dragons.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragon’s nine claws stepped forward seven times in a row, each step stronger than the last. The vast power directly forced the 12 death gods back.</p><p>“Nine Dragons! Lu Ming! It’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>“He’s Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a few shouts of disbelief were heard.</p><p>The Emperor God, the Masters of the Wang family, and the Jiang family shouted in unison. Their eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>They were all too familiar with the bloodline of the nine Dragons. Once the bloodline of the nine Dragons appeared, there was only one person, and that was Lu Ming.</p><p>“How is that possible? How can Lu Ming be here?”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang clan murmured, still in disbelief.</p><p>“Before we arrived at the central continent, we clearly saw Lu Ming at the talisman Amulet sect. Could it be that Lu Ming also took the teleportation formation and came to the central continent? but how is that possible? didn’t the talisman Amulet sect not have any contact with the central continent’s Overlord forces?”</p><p>The master of the Jiang family also muttered to himself.</p><p>Even though they did not believe it, the nine Dragon bloodline in front of them told them that the person in front of them was Lu Ming. There was no mistake!</p><p>Lu Ming, that’s him. No wonder I feel that this person’s aura is so familiar. It’s as if we’ve met before!</p><p>The Emperor God growled. His eyes were cold and murderous.</p><p>He found it hard to accept that this person was Lu Ming. The one who had defeated him so easily was Lu Ming.</p><p>At first, he was full of confidence. His spatial will had reached level four a long time ago and was becoming more and more terrifying. His cultivation had also broken through to the spiritual God Realm. He was completely confident that he could easily defeat Lu Ming when he faced him again and avenge the humiliation he had suffered in the battle of Providence.</p><p>However, the reality was cruel. Lu Ming had become more powerful and had far surpassed him. He could defeat him easily.</p><p>The current Lu Ming was like a huge mountain in front of him.</p><p>At the scene, there was another person who was equally shocked. That person was Xie Zhen.</p><p>“Lu Ming? Lu Shaoqing is Lu Ming?”</p><p>He roared in disbelief, and a terrifying killing intent burst out from his eyes.</p><p>As he looked at the bloodline of the nine Dragons in front of him, the scenes of his past in ninedragons appeared in his mind.</p><p>“What? Lu Ming? What Lu Ming?”</p><p>I heard that the number one genius of the eastern barren territory is called Lu Ming. Could it be him? ”</p><p>“No way? Is he a heaven’s favorite from the East barren?”</p><p>The surrounding people were in an uproar. They discussed animatedly and found it unbelievable.</p><p>Just how many identities did he have?</p><p>In the beginning, he was the commander of the ancient Saint dynasty’s royal law enforcement Army. Then, people recognized him as the famous Lu Shaoqing. Now, he was Lu Ming.</p><p>Many people were confused.</p><p>“I don’t care who you are. Kill!”</p><p>The twelve death gods roared and charged at Lu Ming again.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragons roared and a terrifying devouring power burst out of their mouths, enveloping the twelve death gods.</p><p>“Borrowing power!”</p><p>With a thought, a trace of blood-red power from the third bloodline flowed into the nine Dragons ‘bodies, causing a layer of blood-red fluorescence to appear on the bodies of the nine Dragons.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The nine Dragon steps were aimed at one of the Grim Reapers. With seven steps, the Grim Reapers exploded.</p><p>The divine Dragon wagged its tail and unleashed the might of the prison suppressing heavenly art. The other death god was also crushed.</p><p>The nine Dragons slithered up and pounced toward the other two Grim Reapers.</p><p>Enveloped by the devouring power of the nine Dragons, Dark Child felt his blood essence, vital essence, and bloodline power all become unstable. His strength was greatly affected.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming had used all his strength and performed the blood Meridian fusion. He was stronger than before. The situation was reversed and Lu Ming had the upper hand.</p><p>However, Dark Child was not willing to lose just like that. He did his best to fight Lu Ming.</p><p>However, after a few moves, another death god was defeated, and as time passed, more and more death gods were defeated.</p><p>After dozens of moves, only the Grim Reaper was left on the platform.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After being struck by the nine Dragons ‘claw, the death God’s body retreated frantically.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>After Lu Ming’s Blood Meridian erupted, his combat strength had increased by a notch and he had completely surpassed Dark Child.</p><p>bloodline of the nine Dragons, one of the top ten Battle Beasts. Interesting!</p><p>On the side of the platform, Long Chen, who had been unmoved all this time, suddenly had a shocking light in his eyes. He muttered something to himself, but no one heard him.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>The nine Dragons stepped on the air and pounced toward the last death god.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Although the death god tried its best to resist, it was already an arrow at the end of its flight. How could it stop Lu Ming? His body exploded, revealing Dark child’s true body. His face was pale as his figure flashed backward rapidly.</p><p>The nine Dragons pursued. Dark child’s expression changed. Finally, he sighed and retreated from the platform.</p><p>Leaving the platform could be considered as admitting defeat.</p><p>He knew that there was no need to continue fighting. He could only admit defeat.</p><p>Seeing that Dark Child had admitted defeat, the nine Dragons ‘body shrank rapidly. The next moment, a handsome young man appeared on the platform.</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s original appearance. It was also the appearance he had used when he was using the name Lu Shaoqing.</p><p>At this moment, almost everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s you!”</p><p>The patriarch of the Wang family roared in anger. His killing intent was extremely strong, and his body emitted a powerful aura.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>shut up! a cold shout rang in the ears of the master of the Wang family, causing him to tremble and his aura to weaken rapidly.</p><p>This was the voice of an Emperor.</p><p>All the emperors had gathered here, and the Emperor had yet to speak. Was it his turn to unleash his killing intent?</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>The Emperor God clenched his fists so tightly that his veins were bulging.</p><p>The people of the Empyrean divine Palace were truly shocked and surprised. They did not understand why Lu Ming would appear here.</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s really him. I didn’t expect him to be so powerful!”</p><p>Xue Jian Yi, Shi Zhan, ao tu, and Feng Xuan of the heavenly corpse sect all sighed in disbelief. Their gazes were complicated.</p><p>It had been almost two years since the battle of Providence.</p><p>In the past two years, they had been improving, but Lu Ming’s improvement was even more shocking. He had already left them far behind. Even the top paragons of the divine wilderness continent had been defeated by Lu Ming.</p><p>He was already standing at the peak of the divine wilderness continent’s younger generation. As for them, they were still far from it.</p><p>“Is he really Lu Ming? I can’t believe there’s such a terrifying heaven’s favorite in the East continent!”</p><p>Someone in the crowd said with a complicated voice.</p><p>The eastern barren territory had always been the weakest. Previously, everyone had said that only the Emperor God was decent and that the other geniuses of the eastern barren territory were not worth mentioning. However, Lu Ming had emerged and suppressed everyone. He was destined to enter the top three.</p><p>“So, he is Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, those who had been defeated by Lu Ming previously, such as Liu Yuxin, Shi du, and the three-headed hell hound, were mumbling in low voices. No one knew what thoughts flashed in their minds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
