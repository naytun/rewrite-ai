They were the clan heads of the Wang clan and the Jiang clan respectively.</p><p>...</p><p>The heavenly corpse sect and the heavenly demon Valley each had two Supreme martial artists leading them.</p><p>Everyone took their seats, and then some smaller forces, such as the valley of the medicine Masters, who did not have a sovereign, also came and took their seats on both sides.</p><p>Of course, those who could sit on the seats were all forces with a reputation. At the very least, they had Supreme martial artists sitting on the seats. The forces that were smaller were not qualified to sit on the seats.</p><p>After half an hour, all of them arrived.</p><p>“Let the sacrifice begin!”</p><p>As the voice fell, the huge altar began to glow. Endless light bloomed, covering the entire holy city.</p><p>Xie Qitian stepped out and climbed the ninety-nine stone steps to the altar.</p><p>The royal family and the Xie family, as well as the nobles and ministers, all had solemn expressions as they faced the altar. As for all the powerful figures of the divine wilderness continent, they all stood up.</p><p>“The first offering is to offer sacrifice to the first Saint-Emperor since ancient times!”</p><p>Xie Qitian spoke and bowed towards the altar.</p><p>Sacrifice, not to the heavens, only to the ancestors.</p><p>Martial artists were originally going against the heavens and taking lives from the heavens. Naturally, they would not offer sacrifices to the heavens.</p><p>“The first Saint-Emperor since ancient times!”</p><p>In the royal family, all the nobles and ministers followed Xie Qitian and bowed.</p><p>As for the people from the other forces, they only looked on and did not bow.</p><p>If it had been 30000 years ago, they would naturally have to pay their respects. However, at this point, the major forces no longer had any reverence in their hearts. It was already good enough that they could come. Naturally, no one would pay their respects with the royal family.</p><p>Just as Xie Qitian and the others bowed, a beam of light shot up into the sky from the altar. Then, a statue emerged.</p><p>This statue was the first Saint Emperor of the ancient Saint dynasty a million years ago. He was also the one who had founded the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>After that, Xie Qitian paid his respects to the second Saint Emperor in history.</p><p>At the same time, another statue appeared. This was the second Saint Emperor of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>Following that, the ritual continued. On the altar, statues appeared one after another. They were all statues of the Saint emperors of the ancient Saint dynasty.</p><p>A terrifying aura emanated from the altar. It was as if all the previous Saint emperors had been revived.</p><p>In the end, there were a total of 108 statues on the altar, representing the 108 Saint emperors who had passed away.</p><p>The ancient Saint dynasty had been around for a million years, and there had been more than a hundred of them.</p><p>“There’s no statue of the previous Sage Emperor.”</p><p>“Is the previous Sage Emperor really still alive?”</p><p>Someone saw through the trick.</p><p>Indeed, there was no statue of the previous Sacred Emperor. If the previous Sacred Emperor had already passed away, then his statue would definitely appear here. However, the fact that it didn’t appear now meant that the previous Sacred Emperor was still alive.</p><p>Many emperors of the Overlord forces had a serious look in their eyes.</p><p>Although the Royal Xie family had weakened and could not be compared to 30000 years ago, they were still not to be underestimated. Their strength was astonishing.</p><p>“Hehe, that old man is still here!”</p><p>The hundred-battle Martial Emperor of the heaven suppressing divine Army sneered.</p><p>the sacrifice is over. Now, give me the wine and the pills!</p><p>let’s go! Xie Qitian’s voice rang out. With a wave of his hand, the space cracked open, and the huge altar disappeared into the crack.</p><p>Then, tables and chairs appeared where the altar had been. The royal family, the Xie family, and the ministers all sat down.</p><p>“Give me wine and pills!”</p><p>A voice reverberated through the entire area.</p><p>Heavenly music began to play again, and at the same time, large cauldrons appeared in the palace.</p><p>These cauldrons were as large as mountains, and beneath them were burly, naked men. Each of them was carrying a cauldron as they strolled through the air.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>These cauldrons seemed to be extremely heavy. With every step the burly men took, the space trembled, creating circles of space ripples.</p><p>At a glance, there were a total of 108 burly men carrying 108 cauldrons that were as large as mountains. They stepped on the air and appeared in the sky above the sacred city.</p><p>After the 108 burly men, there were 108 young women. They wore light veils and had graceful curves. Each of them was a beautiful woman with peerless beauty.</p><p>Each of the 108 beautiful women was holding a purple gold gourd.</p><p>you’ve been bestowed with spirit wine and spirit pills. Hurry up and snatch more!</p><p>The eyes of tie Xing and the others lit up as they stared at the sky.</p><p>“Pour!”</p><p>A voice was heard.</p><p>He!</p><p>let’s go! the brawny men shouted. They turned the cauldron and poured the wine down. Instantly, spiritual wine poured out of the cauldron.</p><p>Each of the cauldrons was as big as a mountain, and it was unknown how much spirit wine they contained. At this moment, 108 cauldrons fell at the same time, as if 108 waterfalls were falling from the sky. It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>Moreover, these were all spiritual wines, not ordinary wines. They were refined from spiritual herbs and were very useful for the cultivation of martial artists.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The spirit wine fell from the sky, and the rich aroma of the wine filled the entire sacred city. One could be intoxicated by it with just a sniff.</p><p>“Haha, it’s mine!”</p><p>“I also want one!”</p><p>In the sacred city, countless martial artists rushed into the sky and used their means to draw the spiritual wine to their side.</p><p>During this process, one could obtain the spirit wine through various means, but one could not attack or kill others. Otherwise, one would be killed without mercy.</p><p>This was the rule!</p><p>No one made a move on others. No one killed each other. They only used their own methods to obtain the spiritual wine.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>Lu Ming opened his mouth and took a deep breath. There seemed to be a vortex in his mouth. The spiritual wine in the sky gathered into a stream and he swallowed it.</p><p>As the wine entered his mouth, it immediately turned into a warm current that circulated through his body, making him feel very comfortable.</p><p>“This spirit wine’s medicinal effects are not of much use to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stopped snatching.</p><p>Although this spirit wine was not of much use to spirit God martial artists, it was definitely very useful to those below the spirit God Realm. Moreover, the lower the cultivation, the greater the effect.</p><p>Those in the spiritual ocean and King’s realm would definitely be able to increase their cultivation and condense true Yuan.</p><p>One hundred and eight cauldrons as large as mountains were filled with an unknown amount of spiritual wine. They filled the sky as if there was an endless supply.</p><p>A heavy rain of spirit wine poured down on the entire sacred city.</p><p>However, not a single drop fell to the ground. All of them had been collected by someone using true Qi.</p><p>Very quickly, not a single drop of spirit wine was left in the sky.</p><p>“Bestow the pill!”</p><p>Then, the voice sounded again.</p><p>The 108 beautiful women pulled out the lids of their gourds and poured them down.</p><p>Suddenly, pills poured out of the gourd and scattered all over the sacred city.</p><p>While the gourds didn’t seem large, their storage space was like a storage ring. Countless pills were stored in them, and they poured down to the ground in an endless stream.</p><p>Countless people’s eyes lit up, and they used all their strength to collect the medicinal pills.</p><p>Lu Ming waved his hand and more than ten pills were caught in his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming took a glance and realized that these pills were not of much use to him. However, they were quite useful to those below the spiritual god level.</p><p>There were all kinds of pills, including those for healing, true essence recovery, detoxification, and cultivation.</p><p>The number of such spiritual pills was terrifying.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
