Before the other party could react, Lu Ming had already kicked him in the stomach. He flew out screaming and lined up with the other two people before him. He lay there, looking like a dog eating shit.</p><p>...</p><p>ah, you bastard! You’re dead! The elder of the heavenly Sword faction and Wu chengkong and Wu Cang are here! They’re not far away! The news will spread soon! You’re dead!</p><p>One of the disciples of the sky martial sword faction shouted and threatened Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming strode over and left a footprint on his face, causing his face to rub against the ground.</p><p>“Wu chengkong and Wu Cang? They were killed by Lu Shaoqing in the secret realm of the Saint mansion. If not for the destiny talisman, they would have died long ago. I’ll wait here for these two pieces of trash to come. If Lu Shaoqing can kill them, I can kill them too!”</p><p>Lu Ming lowered his head and looked down at the three disciples of the sky martial sword faction. His cold voice spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Everyone was stunned. This commander was too awesome. He was actually waiting for Wu chengkong and Wu Cang to kill the elites like Lu Shaoqing?</p><p>Lu Shaoqing was a peerless heaven’s favorite, an existence comparable to the five magnates. How could you, the law-enforcement Army, compare to him?</p><p>However, he had to admire Lu Ming’s courage. Lu Ming stepped on the face of the disciple of the sky martial sword faction and waited.</p><p>The other two disciples of the sky martial sword faction lay there, not daring to say a word for fear of being trampled on. However, they hated Lu Ming to the core and wished they could tear him into pieces.</p><p>Tie Xing and the others broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>Tie Xing quietly walked to Lu Ming’s side and said, ” “Commander, this … Wasn’t this too much? What if the experts from the sky martial sword faction come …”</p><p>“What are you afraid of? We’re from the law enforcement Hall, and we enforce the law on behalf of the sage Emperor. What’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>Lu Ming said casually.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Tie Xing and the rest were speechless. They could only brace themselves and wait with Lu Ming.</p><p>What happened here also spread like a whirlwind.</p><p>“What? There was such a thing? There’s such an awesome commander, let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>When many people heard the news, they didn’t believe it at first. Then, they were extremely curious and wanted to go and see.</p><p>Many disciples and geniuses of the Overlord forces were shocked when they heard the news.</p><p>In the past few years, the power of the royal family had been deteriorating, and the law enforcement Army was like an empty name. The geniuses and disciples of the Overlord forces could do whatever they wanted in the holy city. The law enforcement Army did not dare to control them and tried to curry favor with them.</p><p>Now, someone actually dared to beat up the heaven’s martial Sword school’s prodigy. This piqued the curiosity of many people, and they all rushed over to watch.</p><p>In the eighth Prince’s residence, Xie Zhen was drinking tea in the courtyard when Shi Zheng rushed in.</p><p>“Guard Shi, what’s the rush?”</p><p>Xie Zhen asked.</p><p>“Eighth prince, it’s about that Ming Lu!”</p><p>Shi Zheng said.</p><p>“Oh? That blind guy, Is He Dead? Even if he didn’t die, he wouldn’t be able to live on. Hmph, you dare to injure this Prince, you really don’t have eyes, you dog!”</p><p>Xie Zhen took a sip of tea and slowly said.</p><p>he’s not dead. That guy is really audacious. Huang Ke from the Huang family killed someone some time ago, and he actually crippled Huang Ke’s cultivation!</p><p>Shi Zheng answered.</p><p>“Eh? He destroyed Huang Ke’s cultivation? The Huang family didn’t come to kill that Ming Lu?”</p><p>Xie Zhen asked curiously.</p><p>of course they went. A spirit God expert, an old monster with a perfect spirit embryo, and even the commander of the law enforcement Army.</p><p>Shi Zheng said.</p><p>“Oh? In that case, is Minglu still alive?” Xie Zhen was a little curious. In his opinion, in such a situation, Ming Lu should have been killed by the Huang family’s spiritual God.</p><p>no, that Minglu’s combat strength is astonishing. He was actually able to block the spiritual God’s attack and even used the carelessness of a Saint Emperor …</p><p>Shi Zheng briefly explained what happened last time.</p><p>damn it, this Ming Lu actually has such a cultivation, and he even used the name of my imperial family. Hmph, he’s lucky to have escaped this disaster!</p><p>After Xie Zhen heard this, his expression turned ugly and he was very unhappy.</p><p>“You just rushed here and said it was because of Minglu. What happened to him?”</p><p>hehe, he’s dead for sure this time. He actually beat up a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction …</p><p>Shi Zheng told him about how Lu Ming had injured the disciples of the heavenly Sword faction and how he was now waiting for the experts of the faction.</p><p>“This Minglu is really bold. Haha, let’s see how he dies this time. Let’s go, we can’t miss such a good show. Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Xie Zhen got up excitedly and rushed over with Shi Zheng.</p><p>In the northeast of the sacred city, in front of the restaurant, Lu Ming was stepping on the face of a disciple of the heavenly martial sword faction, waiting quietly.</p><p>In the sky, more and more people came, filling the sky.</p><p>“Wu Cang is here!”</p><p>A loud cry rang out, shaking the entire place.</p><p>In one direction, many people opened up a path. In the sky over there, two figures stepped through the air.</p><p>One of them was the second-grade heaven’s favorite of the heavenly Sword faction, Wu Cang.</p><p>Shi Fang was following behind Wu Cang. Lu Ming was slightly stunned. Then, he realized that Shi Fang must have informed Wu Cang.</p><p>In fact, it was true.</p><p>The moment Shi Fang heard that Lu Ming had injured a disciple of the heavenly Sword faction, he knew that his chance had come.</p><p>He had always wanted to befriend a heaven’s favorite like Wu Cang, but he never had the chance. Now, the chance to please him had come. Without hesitation, he rushed to Wu Cang’s residence and passed on the news to him. As expected, Wu Cang was furious and came to kill him.</p><p>Wu Cang walked very slowly, one step at a time. With every step he took, the sky buzzed and shook as if it couldn’t withstand Wu Cang’s anger.</p><p>Wu Cang’s eyes were filled with killing intent and his voice was cold, ” B * stards of the law enforcement Hall, how dare you injure the disciples of the heavenly martial sword faction? good, very good!</p><p>“You’re alone? What about Wu chengkong? I heard that you and your senior brother were beaten up by Lu Shaoqing. I’m going to learn from Lu Shaoqing and beat you up. It’s a pity that you’re the only one!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a casual glance at Wu Cang and said indifferently.</p><p>The crowd was stunned. This commander was too awesome, right? Was Wu Cang not enough? he wanted to learn from Lu Shaoqing and beat up Wu chengkong and Wu Cang? Who did he think he was?</p><p>Wu Cang was a second-class world and was famous all over the world. His cultivation had already reached the spiritual God Realm. Such a heaven’s pride expert’s combat strength was not something that ordinary spiritual God Realm powerhouses could compare to. Back then, Lu Ming was able to block a move from the Huang family’s spiritual God. Did he really think that he could compete with such a heaven’s pride expert?</p><p>He was too naive.</p><p>Many people shook their heads, thinking that this overpowered commander would die today.</p><p>Tie Xing and the rest had ugly expressions on their faces. They did not dare to say a word and could only stand behind Lu Ming with gritted teeth.</p><p>He had no choice. In such a situation, he could only hold on.</p><p>“Hehe, then I’ll see how you’re going to beat him up?”</p><p>Wu Cang laughed out of anger and stepped forward.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled, and the sword power was vast. The sword Qi stirred the wind and clouds. A terrible light was emitted from Wu Cang’s body. Every light was like a sword Qi.</p><p>The sword Qi was endless!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
