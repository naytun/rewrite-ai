His status was very awkward, which was why he applied to come to the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>...</p><p>He had originally thought that he could show off in the divine wilderness continent, suppressing all the so-called elites of the divine wilderness continent beneath his feet.</p><p>In his imagination, wouldn’t these country bumpkins of the divine wilderness continent try to curry favor with him, and even have beautiful women throw themselves into his arms?</p><p>However, the reality was far from what he had imagined.</p><p>From the beginning, he had been beaten up badly by Lu Ming. However, the elder seemed to value Lu Ming’s talent and wanted him to apologize.</p><p>And now, Xie nianjun and Long Chen were still the same.</p><p>He was going to make a move. He was going to cripple Long Chen with a thunderous method and make an example of him. He was going to make the rest of the divine wilderness continent fear him and make Xie nianjun obediently throw herself into his arms.</p><p>He strode toward Long Chen.</p><p>At the side, Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, the unscrupulous monk, Shi du, and the others watched with interest.</p><p>Long Chen was now engaged to Xie nianlin, and Xie nianjun was her sister. If something happened to Xie nianjun, Long Chen naturally wouldn’t sit by and do nothing.</p><p>Mu Feng was about to fight Long Chen. They were curious if Mu Feng could test Long Chen’s strength.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Mu Feng was very direct. He directly attacked Long Chen with his palm. The wind from his palm whistled, and the force of his attack surged in the restaurant.</p><p>However, this was inside the ship. The ship was made of an extremely hard metal, and its entire body was engraved with runes. Even an Emperor would not be able to destroy it easily, so it could naturally block the force.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Long Chen sat still and struck out with his palm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two palms collided, and Mu Feng was forced back seven or eight steps. Long Chen, on the other hand, was still sitting there, motionless.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Mu Feng roared. His face turned red, and his aura became even more violent. The blood vessels appeared above his head. He shouted and attacked Long Chen again.</p><p>Apart from the bloodline fusion, this was his strongest move.</p><p>He did not believe it. He did not believe that the people of the divine wilderness continent were so strong.</p><p>Long Chen stood up. One of his arms suddenly became twice as thick as usual, and he threw a punch.</p><p>This punch was extremely destructive. It destroyed all of Mu Feng’s attacks and landed on Mu Feng’s palm.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Mu Feng’s palm was completely deformed. He let out a scream and his body flew far away like a kite with a broken string. He hit the wall heavily and blood spurted out of his mouth.</p><p>On the side, the unscrupulous monk, Shi du, and the others focused their eyes on Long Chen, their eyes filled with solemnity.</p><p>“Long Chen’s combat strength has become stronger again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He had used the same move to defeat Tuoba Shi in the holy city. Now, he had defeated Mu Feng with the same move. He still gave off an unfathomable feeling.</p><p>Other than the people from the divine wilderness continent, the people from the divine Ruins continent were even more shocked.</p><p>it seems like the divine wilderness continent has produced a few impressive elites!</p><p>Some people from the continent of the divine Ruins sighed.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Long Chen’s eyes fell on Mu Feng.</p><p>Mu Feng struggled to get up. His eyes were about to spit fire. He was so aggrieved.</p><p>He had originally thought that he could show off in the divine wilderness continent, but he had never expected to be beaten up.</p><p>“You guys, just you wait!”</p><p>Mu Feng left with his tail between his legs.</p><p>Long Chen sat down and continued to drink, and the scene returned to peace.</p><p>“Lu Ming, are you confident in going up against Long Chen?”</p><p>Xie nianqing sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>“I don’t know!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sent a voice transmission,’I know too little about Long Chen. I don’t know what his bloodline is. We don’t even know his exact cultivation level, so it’s hard to measure it!”</p><p>“It seems that you have an opponent!”</p><p>Xie nianqing smiled.</p><p>don’t worry. In the future, I’ll suppress all enemies. The man you like will be invincible!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, full of confidence.</p><p>How could he be so confident? when his nine Dragon bloodline and the prison-suppressing stele bloodline both advanced to divine level nine, his combat power would be greatly improved. He would be invincible in a battle of the same level.</p><p>“You’re so smug!”</p><p>Xie nianqing blushed and rolled his eyes at Lu Ming. However, his eyes were filled with a happy smile.</p><p>After eating and drinking for a while, Lu Ming and Xie nianqing paid the bill and left. They strolled around the ship for a while before coming to the deck. Outside, the wind was howling.</p><p>With the speed of the cross-sea flying ship, the wind formed by breaking through the space was terrifyingly powerful. As long as anyone below the spiritual god level came to the deck, they would be crushed into pieces by the storm.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing released their vital essence to block the storm and looked around.</p><p>What came into view was an ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see. On the ocean, the wind howled, and under the ocean, there were thousands of waves that were ten thousand meters high. It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing held hands and looked at the spectacular scene together.</p><p>…….</p><p>A month’s time was very short to cultivators. It passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A month later, they had already arrived at the continent of the divine Ruins and entered its boundary.</p><p>The divine wilderness continent’s paragons gathered on the deck and looked down at the magnificent rivers and mountains.</p><p>what a dense heaven and earth spiritual Qi! There’s a dense origin Qi mixed in the spiritual Qi!</p><p>Tuoba Shi took in a deep breath and revealed an intoxicated expression.</p><p>that’s right, this kind of cultivation environment is much better than the divine wilderness continent. Even if an Emperor were to cultivate here, it would be much easier to break through. The conditions are much better than the divine wilderness continent!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed carefully.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent was not only rich in spirit Qi and origin Qi, but it also seemed to be easier to comprehend the essence realm of heaven and earth.</p><p>Cultivating in such an environment would naturally be faster, and there would be more experts.</p><p>it is said that the divine Ruins and the yuan continent are still thousands of miles apart. I really don’t know what the cultivation environment of the yuan continent is like!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>The warship flew quickly in the sky, and endless majestic mountains and rivers passed below. Two days later, a vast ancient city appeared in front of them.</p><p>everyone, that ancient city is where the southern deity Palace of the divine Gate is located. You will be staying there for nearly three months!</p><p>The black-robed man said.</p><p>I’ll roughly tell you the process of the Tian Shen sect’s selection of disciples this time, as well as the situation of the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>in the divine Ruins continent, the gate of God is the most respected. The gate of God is also divided into four divine palaces, North, South, East, and West. However, the four divine palaces each govern a region and have been governed separately for countless years. Therefore, although the four divine palaces now all belong to the gate of God, they can actually be considered four forces. They compete with each other and even fight!</p><p>and in the four directions of the divine Ruins continent, there are a total of forty-two continents, called the divine Ruins continent cluster. The four great divine palaces are each in charge of one direction. The divine wilderness continent is in the South of the divine Ruins continent and belongs to my South deity Palace. There are a total of Nine Continents, and we have to wait for the elites of the nine Continents to gather together and head to the ancient city of the divine Ruins three months later!</p><p>The black-robed man explained in detail.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
