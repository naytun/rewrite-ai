All the fluctuations seemed to have suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“How is it?”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a figure flickered, and Xie Luan appeared.</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan’s breathing was a little shallow. A trace of blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth. He had actually been injured.</p><p>Qu Luo, the Barbarian Emperor, and the others found it unbelievable that Xie Luan had been injured in the battle with Martial Emperor Di Yi.</p><p>Ancestor devil, how is Di Yi? ”</p><p>Qu Luo asked.</p><p>Di Yi has retreated!</p><p>Xie Luan spoke, his eyes grave. I didn’t expect the East continent to have such a powerful cultivator. I can’t defeat him with my current combat strength!</p><p>Senior Xie, what realm has Di Yi reached? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>To be honest, Di Yi’s combat power was beyond his imagination.</p><p>He had thought that Di Yi was just an ordinary Emperor. Now, it seemed that he was not. He was much stronger than an ordinary Emperor.</p><p>After this period of time, Xie Lun had recovered and was stronger than he had been a few months ago. However, he was still injured in the battle with Di Yi.</p><p>Lu Ming, the Martial Emperor realm is the same as the other realms. It is divided into nine levels, but the difference between each level is huge!</p><p>as for the divine wilderness continent, the conditions are too poor. It’s not suitable for emperors to cultivate at all. To be able to break through to the Emperor realm is already the limit. It’s too difficult to go further. Hence, most of the emperors in the divine wilderness continent are at the first level Martial Emperor realm. For example, barbarian Emperor, qu Luo and the rest, as well as most of the emperors from the Overlord forces in central continent, are all at the first level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Xie Luan introduced.</p><p>Qu Luo and the Barbarian Emperor nodded.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. It seemed that the sovereigns he had met were only at the lowest level of martial emperors.</p><p>Xie Luan continued to explain, ” once someone breaks through to Lv 2 martial Royal realm, his combat strength will be greatly improved. He will be able to suppress and even kill other martial Royal realm experts. The gap between Lv 1 martial Royal realm experts is very obvious. I guess there are some martial Royal realm experts in the royal family and the heaven suppressing divine Army!</p><p>and my cultivation back then was at the third level of the martial Royal realm. Now, I have recovered to the peak of the second level. However, it will be extremely difficult for me to recover to the third level. Firstly, the conditions of the divine wilderness continent are too poor. Secondly, after being suppressed for so many years, my source has been injured. It will be very difficult for me to recover to the peak without a few years!</p><p>is Di Yi’s cultivation also at the peak of the second level of the martial Royal realm? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>that’s right. Di Yi’s cultivation is indeed at the peak of the LV 2 martial Royal realm. He’s not far from the LV 3 martial Royal realm. I feel that Di Yi can break into the LV 3 martial Royal realm at any time. By then, he will be unrivaled in the world and no one in the divine wilderness mainland can defeat him!</p><p>Xie Luan said, his eyes grave.</p><p>Di Yi is so strong? ”</p><p>Yan kuangtu clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were solemn. He and Di Yi had to fight a long time ago, but now it seemed that this battle would be more difficult than he had imagined.</p><p>I have to improve my strength as soon as possible. Now, the second body has obtained the inheritance of the mysterious sky Saint and is improving rapidly. My martial cultivation can’t fall behind. If my martial cultivation and the second body both break into the Emperor realm, I can suppress Di Yi even if he breaks through to the third level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with confidence and fighting spirit.</p><p>If the main body and the secondary body both broke through to the Emperor realm and joined forces, their power would definitely be beyond imagination.</p><p>“All of you can leave!”</p><p>With a wave of Xie Luan’s hand, everyone below the Emperor level dispersed.</p><p>Xie Luan then looked at Lu Ming and said, ” Lu Ming, you don’t have to worry too much. The conditions in the divine wilderness continent are really bad. It’s extremely difficult for a martial artist in the Emperor realm to make a breakthrough. It’s not that easy for Di Yi to break through to the third level of the martial Royal realm. He might not be able to break through for a few years, or he might not be able to break through in his entire life. It’s possible. Back then, I was stuck at the peak of the third level of the martial Royal realm and was unable to break through to the fourth level!</p><p>he can’t do anything to you if he can’t break through to Lv 3 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Xie Luan smiled and consoled him.</p><p>thank you, senior, I’m fine. The stronger Di Yi is, the stronger my motivation will be. I will kill Di Yi with my own hands this time. This day will not be too long!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><p>“Good, haha!”</p><p>Xie Luan patted Lu Ming’s shoulder and laughed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>At this moment, Xie Luan suddenly turned his gaze to the northern sky.</p><p>The others were stunned. What did Xie Luan discover? Could it be that Di Yi had returned?</p><p>However, they soon realized.</p><p>In the sky to the North, a huge warship broke through the void and was flying at high speed.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As the warship sailed past, it let out a deafening roar. It was like a divine sword that split the space in half.</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed. Could it be that they were coming for them? who in the divine wilderness continent had the guts to do that?</p><p>Moreover, they came from the North.</p><p>Very quickly, they realized that they had been overthinking. The warship was not heading towards them, but was flying past the demon God Valley.</p><p>From a distance, the warship was carved with beautiful patterns, and there was a misty light flowing on it.</p><p>“Look, there are people on the warship!”</p><p>Qu Luo shouted.</p><p>As expected, they saw a middle-aged man at the bow of the warship. He was wearing a black robe and stood with his hands behind his back. He was just standing there casually, but he seemed to have a domineering temperament.</p><p>At that moment, the black-robed middle-aged man seemed to have sensed Lu Ming’s gaze and looked over.</p><p>With just a glance, Lu Ming could feel his heart thumping. It was like the vast starry sky, and he felt extremely small.</p><p>At the side, Xie nianqing’s grip on Lu Ming’s hand tightened and his face turned pale.</p><p>However, this person only glanced at them and didn’t look at them again. He turned his head.</p><p>so strong! This person is so strong! It’s hard to estimate!</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor’s voice rang out.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and was shocked. At that moment, the Barbarian Emperor’s forehead was covered in cold sweat. His eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>third level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Xie Luan muttered to himself, his brows tightly furrowed.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>“How is that possible? Third level Martial Emperor? how can there be a third level Martial Emperor in the divine wilderness continent?”</p><p>Quluo exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>who said they are from the divine wilderness continent? I have seen the patterns on that warship overseas 30000 years ago. If I am not wrong, they are from the divine Ruins continent!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>“The divine Ruins continent? Why would the people from the divine Ruins continent suddenly come to our divine wilderness continent?”</p><p>The Barbarian Emperor asked in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xie nianqing, and Yan kuangtu, on the other hand, looked puzzled.</p><p>The divine Ruins continent? Where was it?</p><p>From the name, it must be from a mainland overseas. Why would someone from a mainland overseas suddenly descend into the divine wilderness?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
