His eyes widened in shock, and he momentarily forgot to attack.</p><p>...</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Xie Luan led Lu Ming and Xie nianqing and dashed toward the exit.</p><p>A few experts tried to stop him, but Xie Luan sent them flying with a single slap.</p><p>Xie Luan, along with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, dashed into the door of light and disappeared.</p><p>The white-haired Supreme Being only came to his senses after he watched Xie Luan, Lu Ming, and the others disappear.</p><p>“Autarch, who is that person? How could he be so powerful?”</p><p>An expert flew over to the white-haired sovereign and asked.</p><p>They were very curious. The white-haired Supreme martial artist had clearly been able to stop the other party, but he had stopped at the critical moment.</p><p>“I have seen this person’s portrait before. This person … This person is the sovereign of chaos, Xie Luan!”</p><p>The white-haired sovereign said in a heavy voice.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>The white-haired sovereign shouted and chased after the exit.</p><p>The surroundings blurred and Lu Ming and the rest appeared from another door of light. This door of light was the entrance to the holy city.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>As soon as Xie Luan appeared, he immediately charged upward.</p><p>The demonic Qi surged as it broke through all the barriers. Xie Luan broke through all the barriers at the entrance, and finally broke through the earth and into the sky.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Xie Luan tore open the space and stepped into the crack with Lu Ming and Xie nianqing, disappearing.</p><p>At this moment, in the center of the sacred city, deep within the palace, Xie Qitian, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes. There was a look of shock and doubt in his eyes.</p><p>“What a powerful demonic Qi and demonic power! This is the entrance to the abyss Demon Realm. Did something happen there?”</p><p>Xie Qitian mumbled. He then stood up and took a step forward. The space around him split open and he disappeared. In the next moment, he reappeared in the sky above the entrance of the abyss demon territory.</p><p>At this moment, the white-haired Supreme martial artist was rushing out in a hurry and happened to bump into Xie Qitian.</p><p>“Sage Emperor, bad news!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said in a panic.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Xie Qitian furrowed his brows. He had a bad feeling about this. What could possibly cause a Supreme martial artist to be in such a panic?</p><p>“Sage Emperor, it’s Xie Luan! I saw Xie Luan!”</p><p>The white-haired sovereign said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xie Qitian’s eyes widened in shock, ” “What did you just say? You’re saying that the person who just charged out of the demon Realm of Tartarus is Xie Luan, the sovereign of chaos?”</p><p>Xie Qitian asked this question a few times, showing how shocked he was.</p><p>“They look exactly the same. I don’t know if it’s real or not!”</p><p>The white-haired sovereign said.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Even though Xie Qitian was a Saint Emperor and his expression remained unchanged, he lost his sense of propriety and became extremely anxious after hearing that it was Xie Luan.</p><p>Xie Luan was a taboo of the Royal Xie family.</p><p>Back then, the Royal Xie family dominated the central continent and even the divine wilderness continent. They were extremely prosperous and had many experts. However, because of Xie Luan, their strength had plummeted and declined by an unknown amount.</p><p>Now, if it really was Xie Lun, how could the imperial family resist him with their current strength?</p><p>Xie Qitian hurriedly entered the abyss demon territory and tore through space. Soon, he arrived at the devil tablet mountain.</p><p>Xie Qitian stood in the sky above the devil tablet mountain and looked at the empty mountain. A terrifying aura emanated from his body.</p><p>“Thirty thousand years, thirty thousand years, how could he still be alive?”</p><p>Xie Qitian mumbled to himself.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The space rippled, and two old men appeared beside Xie Qitian, exuding a vast Emperor’s might.</p><p>Near the devil tablet mountain, there were still some scattered powerful beings from the Mosha clan. When they felt the terrifying aura in the sky, they all fled for their lives.</p><p>“The devil tablet that suppressed Xie Luan has disappeared. Could it be that Xie Luan is still alive? how is it possible that he hasn’t died in thirty thousand years?”</p><p>An old Emperor said in a trembling voice, revealing a trace of shock.</p><p>In the past, they had heard about the strange phenomena of the devil tablet mountain, but they didn’t pay much attention to it. They thought that it was just a trace of Xie Luan’s demonic will. After all, how could an Emperor live for thirty thousand years without dying? this seemed to go against the rules of heaven and earth.</p><p>They had no idea that the stele that suppressed Xie Lun was the prison-guarding stele, nor did they know that the prison-guarding stele had actually slowed down the rate at which Xie Lun’s life was flowing away.</p><p>Xie Luan is simply heaven-defying and can’t be measured with common sense. Moreover, the guard said that he brought Lu Ming and nianqing with him. This must be related to them!</p><p>Said Xie Qitian. His voice was filled with coldness.</p><p>“Your Majesty, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>An old Emperor asked.</p><p>even if Xie Luan is still alive, he can’t be completely fine after being suppressed for thirty thousand years. His vitality must have been greatly damaged, and his strength must have been greatly reduced. Otherwise, with Xie Luan’s character, he wouldn’t have fled in such a hurry!</p><p>use the heaven’s secrets instrument and lock onto Xie Luan ‘s-no, Lu Ming ‘s-location. At the same time, spread the word to all the overlords and forces to kill Lu Ming. Those who succeed will be rewarded with a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure!</p><p>At this moment, Xie Qitian had already regained his calm, reenacting the bearing of a generation’s Saint Emperor.</p><p>At first, he wanted to say ‘Xie Luan’, but he changed his tone and said’ Lu Ming’.</p><p>He had a vague feeling that this matter had something to do with Lu Ming. In the past, Xie nianqing had been in the abyss demon territory for so long, but there had been no trouble. However, Lu Ming had only been in there for a short time, and now there was such a big mess. He did not believe that this was a coincidence.</p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty!”</p><p>The two old emperors bowed.</p><p>……</p><p>Xie Luan brought Lu Ming and Xie nianqing along as they tore through space. After seven or eight consecutive times, Xie Luan stopped, his breathing weak.</p><p>“I’ve been suppressed for 30000 years, and my vitality has been greatly damaged. My demonic body has almost collapsed, and I don’t have much strength left. The ‘supplements’ I absorbed before were too weak, and I’ve almost used them up. I can’t help you anymore!”</p><p>Xie Luan sighed.</p><p>“How can senior recover?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>I need supplements. I’ll naturally recover by hunting experts. If I can kill an Emperor, I might be able to recover my Emperor’s strength.</p><p>Xie Luan smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. Kill the Emperor? Forget it, he didn’t want to die.</p><p>of course, there are other ways. Although I was suppressed back then, I still have a backup plan. Take me to the border between the central continent and the East continent. I have a backup plan there. If I go there, I can recover some of my strength and I can protect myself!</p><p>Xie Luan said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. It was normal for a person like Xie Luan to have a backup plan.</p><p>Then, Xie Luan gave Lu Ming an address. He turned into a beam of light and disappeared from Lu Ming’s spine, entering the fragment of the prison suppressing stele.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming and Xie nianqing looked at each other and flew toward the east.</p><p>However, the two of them suddenly stopped after flying for a short while.</p><p>This was because there was suddenly an endless flash of light above Lu Ming’s head. These lights then gathered together and formed a spherical object. There were waves of mysterious fluctuations that spread into the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
