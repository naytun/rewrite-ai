I suspect that he has obtained Emperor Cang’s treasures or inheritance!</p><p>At the side, he Yu added fuel to the fire.</p><p>...</p><p>“What? Emperor Cang’s inheritance!”</p><p>These words were like a heavy bomb, causing the scene to explode.</p><p>Countless people looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Even the master of Silver Dragon Valley had a burning light in his eyes.</p><p>If the Saint breakthrough pill only tempted many experts at the peak of the martial Royal realm, then Emperor Cang’s treasures and inheritance would tempt even the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>I’ve already said that I didn’t receive Emperor Cang’s inheritance. This point has been proven several days ago in front of the experts from the various sects. Elder Hong is here to prove my words!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“That’s right, Lu Ming did not receive Emperor Cang’s legacy!”</p><p>Elder Hong said.</p><p>the inheritance of Emperor Cang is of great importance. I suggest that Lu Ming hand over everything for us to check. We will also search his soul. This way, we will be absolutely safe!</p><p>Yin Feng said loudly as his eyes flashed with ruthlessness.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming threw his head back and laughed. I’ve already said that I didn’t get the inheritance. Elder Hong has also proven it. Moreover, it’s also stated in advance that those who enter the great Emperor’s Secret realm are free to hand over any treasures they obtain. Now, you’re forcing me like this. Is this how Dragon God Valley treats its disciples? it’s really chilling!</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley shouted and his eyes turned cold. you’re just a little reserve disciple. How dare you talk about Dragon God Valley? you’re so audacious. Feng ‘er is right. I’m going to search your soul to confirm …</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley took a step forward and locked onto Lu Ming. Lu Ming realized that he could not move at all, as if he had been fixed in place.</p><p>Yin Zheng, you’re already so old, and you’re the master of a Valley. Don’t you find it embarrassing to treat a junior like this? ”</p><p>At this moment, a gentle voice rang out between heaven and earth.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly felt his body relax and he regained his freedom.</p><p>Many people were shocked. Who dared to speak to the master of Silver Dragon Valley in such a way?</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley frowned as he looked at the sky.</p><p>In the sky, two figures stepped through the air.</p><p>An old man with a gentle smile on his face followed by a middle-aged man.</p><p>“Senior Longyuan mountain!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The middle-aged man behind the old man was Longyuan mountain.</p><p>“Greetings, Cloud Dragon Valley master!”</p><p>Many people saluted the old man when they saw him.</p><p>“Cloud Dragon Valley master!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Another Valley master had arrived.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley stared at the master of Cloud Dragon Valley and said, ” “What’s wrong? Are you trying to meddle in my business?”</p><p>“What do you mean by being a busybody? This little guy was right. How could the Dragon God Valley treat their disciples like this? To be honest, not to mention the fact that this little guy didn’t get Emperor Cang’s inheritance, even if he did, it’s up to him whether he wants to hand it over or not. My Dragon God Valley only needs to ensure his growth!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said indifferently.</p><p>“What if I forcibly soulscour you?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said.</p><p>“You can try!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes flashed as a mysterious aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley looked at the master of Cloud Dragon Valley with a serious expression. After a while, he turned to elder Hong and asked, ” elder Hong, are you sure that this brat did not obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance? ”</p><p>it’s impossible for him to obtain it, because Emperor Cang is still alive!</p><p>Elder Hong said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was shocked.</p><p>Not only him, everyone present was shocked.</p><p>Emperor Cang was not dead. These four words were too shocking and could explain everything.</p><p>After a while, the scene slowly quieted down.</p><p>“Let’s continue!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley waved his hand and sat down on a chair.</p><p>“You guys continue!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master also sat down.</p><p>“Little guy, please register!”</p><p>The white-haired elder said to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He registered his information and walked off the stage.</p><p>Then, one by one, they went up and handed over their treasures.</p><p>Just like that, two days and two nights passed before the treasure submission segment finally came to an end.</p><p>Next up was the second option, which was to join one of the seven great dragon valleys.</p><p>An elder came from each Dragon Valley and set up a counter in the square.</p><p>here, each elder represents a Dragon Valley. If you want to join any Dragon Valley, you can come forward and register!</p><p>Elder Hong pointed at the seven counters and said.</p><p>Each of the seven counters had a symbol that indicated different Dragon valleys.</p><p>However, the silver Dragon Valley and the cloud Dragon Valley were special.</p><p>The elders of the other Dragon valleys had come. Only the valley Masters of these two Dragon valleys had come in person.</p><p>“I’ll join ICE Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Someone stepped forward and walked towards Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Let me see your spirit body!”</p><p>The elder of Ice Dragon Valley said.</p><p>This young man exuded a cold aura and a faint dragon roar could be heard.</p><p>yes, it’s the Ice Dragon combat body. I can join!</p><p>The elder of Ice Dragon Valley nodded and registered the young man’s information.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll join the purple dragon Valley!”</p><p>“I’ll join the Black Dragon Valley!”</p><p>One by one, the young men stepped forward and chose the Dragon Valley they wanted to join.</p><p>Naturally, Yin Feng joined Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>He Yu, on the other hand, had joined the blood Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Senior, I want to join cloud Dragon Valley!”</p><p>A young man walked up to the cloud Dragon Valley master and said respectfully.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the cloud Dragon Valley master shook his head and said, ” “You’re not suitable for Cloud Dragon Valley. Go!”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>This stunned many people. Cloud Dragon Valley wouldn’t accept them!</p><p>As long as the spirit body was suitable, the other Dragon valleys would accept it.</p><p>It was because these young men’s talents had been tested long ago. They were all very good and were fully qualified to join Dragon God Valley. However, Cloud Dragon Valley did not accept them!</p><p>hehe, you don’t know this, do you? Cloud Dragon Valley only has a hundred people. They’re the weakest among the seven Dragon valleys, so naturally, the number of people who join is the least. There’s one more thing. The cloud Dragon Valley master is very strange when it comes to accepting people. He doesn’t accept ordinary people at all. He only accepts people according to his mood!</p><p>A local disciple explained.</p><p>“Accept people according to your mood?”</p><p>Many people were speechless.</p><p>As expected, a few more people wanted to join cloud Dragon Valley, but they were all rejected by the valley master.</p><p>“Lu Ming, which Dragon Valley do you want to join?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying asked.</p><p>“I don’t know yet!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He had not thought about it yet.</p><p>His spiritual body was the Dragon God combat body. To be honest, he could join any Dragon Valley.</p><p>Moreover, his domain was the chaos Domain, so he could join any Dragon Valley without any problem.</p><p>However, he had already ruled out the silver Dragon Valley and the blood Dragon Valley, so he would not join them.</p><p>The rest of the Dragon Valley would do.</p><p>“You don’t know? Lu Ming, I’ll go and register first. I’ll join ICE Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
