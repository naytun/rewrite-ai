I’ve already brought people there, but they found out that the Feng family has been massacred. Not even a chicken or dog was left.</p><p>...</p><p>At this point, Yin Feng’s cold eyes looked at Lu Ming.”Lu Ming, you’re so ruthless and decisive. You didn’t leave any evidence behind!”</p><p>The unspoken meaning was obvious!</p><p>Yin Feng was referring to the fact that Lu Ming had annihilated the Feng family.</p><p>The Feng family had been exterminated.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at Yin Feng, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Needless to say, the Feng family’s destruction was definitely yinfeng’s doing. He was afraid that Lu Ming would find the Feng family to testify for Lu Ming.</p><p>What a ruthless method. In order to deal with Lu Ming, he directly exterminated the Feng family. Now, he was slandering Lu Ming for exterminating the Feng family.</p><p>The corners of Yin Feng’s mouth curled into a cold smile as he looked at Lu Ming mockingly.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see how you’re going to prove yourself!”</p><p>Yin Feng sneered in his heart.</p><p>Yin Feng, you’ve really put in a lot of effort to deal with me. You’ve annihilated the Feng family, destroyed the evidence, and framed me!</p><p>I know you hate me. Back then, I stepped on your face nine times in front of everyone. In the Emperor Cang Mystic realm, I beat you until you knelt in front of me. It is understandable that you hate me and want to take revenge on me!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He pushed all the blame back to yinfeng in a casual manner. Yinfeng had framed him in order to take revenge on him.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>nonsense! Many people saw it. How am I talking nonsense? if you have the ability, kill all these people!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace’s elder also frowned.</p><p>Lu Ming and Yin Feng both had their own reasons. He did not know who to listen to.</p><p>elder, yinfeng hired his fellow disciples and tampered with the mission. He wanted Xu long, Duan Yan, and the others to kill me during the mission. After that, he massacred the entire Feng family and framed me. This person is insane and must be severely punished!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the elder of the Dragon Punishment Hall, turning the tables on Yin Feng.</p><p>“You … You’re talking nonsense, this is slander, slander!”</p><p>Yin Feng roared.</p><p>“Slander? If you want to know the truth, it’s very simple. As long as I capture you and search your soul, the truth will naturally be revealed!”</p><p>Lu Ming said as he strode toward yinfeng.</p><p>“What do you want to do? You want to kill me!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A figure stepped forward and stood in front of Lu Ming. It was the seventh level martial Royal realm youth from the Dragon Punishment Hall.</p><p>“Your opponent is me!”</p><p>Xue ningxin appeared and threw a punch at the young man from the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>The seventh level martial Royal realm youth had no choice but to fight Xue ningxin.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he continued to step toward yinfeng.</p><p>“Attack, attack, kill this person!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>One by one, the young men who had followed Yin Feng pounced on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming roared and his black wings appeared. With one flap, five to six young men spat out blood and were sent flying.</p><p>In the air, the elder of the Dragon Punishment Hall raised his eyebrows. He was about to stop them, but at this moment, a voice entered his ears, making him stop.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element art. He took a step forward and his speed increased dramatically as he rushed toward Yin Feng.</p><p>“Go back!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>There were at least a dozen young men charging toward Lu Ming. Some of them were even at the peak of the fifth level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>&Nbsp; the third-level Primal Chaos Domain spread out, enshrouding the youths within. These youths immediately felt a terrifying pressure press down on them, and their bones threatened to break.</p><p>Some of the weaker ones sprawled on the ground and vomited blood.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming threw a punch. A terrifying fist force burst out and sent a few martial artists at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm flying.</p><p>Many people gasped.</p><p>Lu Ming was only at the second level of the martial Royal realm, but even an expert at the peak of the fifth level was no match for him and was sent flying.</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure was as fast as lightning as he approached Yin Feng.</p><p>Yin Feng’s face turned pale as he frantically retreated.</p><p>He did not expect Lu Ming to be so bold as to capture him and search his soul.</p><p>If he searched her soul, the truth would be revealed.</p><p>He must not let Lu Ming take him down.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was too fast. He was approaching him at an extreme speed. The young man who came with him could not stop Lu Ming at all.</p><p>“Evil creature, you dare?”</p><p>At this moment, an angry roar came from the depths of the sky. The voice rumbled like a god. Then, a huge hand reached down from the clouds and grabbed Lu Ming.</p><p>The terrifying pressure froze Lu Ming in place, rendering him unable to move.</p><p>“Master of Silver Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared angrily.</p><p>Lu Ming could tell from the voice that it was the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>The dignified Valley master had actually attacked a junior like Lu Ming.</p><p>Yin Zheng, you’re really getting worse and worse. You attacked my disciple in front of Cloud Dragon Valley. Do you think I don’t exist? ”</p><p>A gentle voice came from the depths of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Then, a sword light burst out and slashed at the big hand. The big hand was directly split into two and then cracked.</p><p>“Yun ruoxu!”</p><p>In the sky, a rumbling sound was heard. Then, with a flash of silver light, an old man in silver bubbles appeared.</p><p>It was the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley appeared and looked into the depths of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>In Cloud Dragon Valley, an old man stepped on a cloud. It was the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, do what you should be doing!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master appeared and said indifferently.</p><p>The meaning was obvious. He wanted Lu Ming to continue taking down yinfeng.</p><p>“Junior, you dare?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley looked at Lu Ming with a cold gaze.</p><p>“I’m so scared!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. He flapped his black wings, bringing with him a gust of strong wind as he rushed towards Yin Feng.</p><p>“Grandpa, save me!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>“How audacious!”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! the master of Silver Dragon roared, and a terrifying dragon roar came from his body as a silver-white light shot ten thousand meters into the air with terrifying energy.</p><p>“Yin Zheng, if you want to fight, I’ll accompany you!”</p><p>&Nbsp; the valley master of Cloud Dragon took a step forward and suddenly appeared in front of the valley master of Silver Dragon, slashing at him with his sword.</p><p>The strike was plain, but the valley master’s expression changed. Silver light burst out as he fought with the valley master.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow, and the entire sky seemed to be split open by the sword light and silver light. The vast pressure almost made everyone breathless.</p><p>“Is this the valley master’s strength? It’s so strong!”</p><p>Many people were extremely shocked.</p><p>“Let’s go up and fight!”</p><p>let’s go! the cloud Dragon Valley Master’s Voice rang out. He and the silver Dragon Valley master rushed into the void and began their battle.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming continued to attack Yin Feng.</p><p>The few young men who were protecting Yin Feng were sent flying. No matter how frantically Yin Feng retreated, his speed was still far from Lu Ming’s.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in front of Yin Feng. The chaos Domain crushed down and Yin Feng spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming grabbed Yin Feng’s neck and flapped his black wings. He carried Yin Feng back to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
