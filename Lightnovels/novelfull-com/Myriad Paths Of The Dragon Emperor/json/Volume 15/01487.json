What a joke, my Junior Brother just killed a good-for-nothing, what’s the big deal? it’s just a waste of resources to keep such a good-for-nothing in Dragon God Valley. It’s better to kill him earlier!”</p><p>Xue ningxin said coldly.</p><p>Many people were dumbfounded.</p><p>What kind of logic was this? This was really too overbearing, too arrogant.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The LV 7 martial Royal realm expert and Yin Feng were both stunned. They did not know what to say to Xue ningxin.</p><p>It was completely unreasonable!</p><p>now, get lost. Otherwise, I’ll throw them out one by one!</p><p>Xue ningxin scolded.</p><p>Xue ningxin, it seems that you must interfere today. Then, I will take you down as well!</p><p>The seventh level martial Royal realm expert said coldly. A powerful and terrifying aura burst out and pressed toward Xue ningxin.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xue ningxin’s body also exploded with a powerful aura.</p><p>The fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Everyone could see that Xue ningxin’s cultivation was at the LV 5 martial Royal realm. However, her powerful aura was extremely shocking. She could actually contend with a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>“Thousand mountain fist, kill!”</p><p>die! the LV 7 martial Royal realm expert suddenly shouted and stepped forward, throwing a punch at Xue ningxin.</p><p>With a punch, it was as if a heavy mountain had appeared in the sky, pressing down on Xue ningxin.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a Dragon’s Roar came from Xue ningxin’s body, which made her aura even stronger.</p><p>Xue ningxin also threw out a punch.</p><p>With a punch, Xue ningxin’s fist seemed to have turned into ice, emitting a terrifying cold air.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Xue ningxin’s fist clashed with the heavy mountain.</p><p>A terrifying explosion sounded at the scene. Then, the mountain was directly frozen and exploded. Waves of terrifying cold currents spread in all directions.</p><p>The temperature at the scene dropped sharply. Some of the people with low cultivation levels shivered and were covered in a layer of frost.</p><p>The LV 7 martial Royal realm expert and Xue ningxin’s bodies trembled at the same time and they retreated.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>“What a freak!”</p><p>A thought flashed through many people’s minds, and they looked at Xue ningxin in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>Xue ningxin’s combat power was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Xue ningxin, who was only at the fifth level of the martial Royal realm, was able to fight against a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert. It should be known that a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert was already a high-level martial Royal realm expert. Her combat strength was absolutely shocking and had stepped into another level.</p><p>In a sect like Dragon God Valley, a high-level martial Royal realm expert was considered a middle-rank power.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Xue ningxin stepped back, her eyes filled with excitement. A Dragon’s Roar came from her body, and above her head, a white snow Dragon’s Shadow could be seen.</p><p>“This Senior Sister really likes to fight!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think this way.</p><p>He recalled the first time he met Xue ningxin, when Xue ningxin threw a punch without saying anything.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Right at this moment, an elder suddenly appeared in the sky. His powerful aura filled the entire area, causing everyone to feel a terrifying pressure.</p><p>A Sage!</p><p>Without a doubt, the elder in the sky was a Saint.</p><p>This old man was wearing a long Golden Dragon robe, which was almost the same as the ones worn by the people of the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>An elder of the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the elder!”</p><p>As expected, the youths of the Dragon Punishment Hall saluted the old man.</p><p>The others followed suit.</p><p>When the Dragon punishment Palace’s elder arrived, Xue ningxin and the LV 7 martial Royal realm expert naturally stopped fighting at the same time.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace’s elder asked with a frown.</p><p>Previously, he had been informed that many experts of the Dragon punishment Palace had gathered in Cloud Dragon Valley. He had immediately rushed over and just happened to see the scene of Xue ningxin fighting with the experts of the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>elder, I’m yin Feng, the grandson of the master of Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>Yin Feng reported his name first and then said, ” it’s like this. Lu Ming killed his fellow disciples and plotted to seize their treasures. He’s guilty of the most heinous crimes. The senior brothers of the Dragon Punishment Hall and I are about to arrest him.</p><p>“Killing fellow disciples?”</p><p>A cold glint flickered in the Dragon Punishment Hall’s elder’s eyes. He looked at Lu Ming and said,”Is there such a thing?”</p><p>“Yinfeng’s mouth is like a dog’s. He’s just randomly biting people!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what did you just say?”</p><p>Yin Feng glared at Lu Ming. Lu Ming actually dared to call him a dog.</p><p>“Dog, silver dog!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Yin Feng’s face turned green with anger. He cupped his fists at the Dragon punishment Palace’s elder and said, ” elder, there is irrefutable evidence that this man has killed his fellow disciples. I have already sent someone to collect the evidence. I hope that elder will handle this matter impartially. Otherwise, I’m afraid that the others in Dragon God Valley will be disappointed!</p><p>“Lu Ming, what do you have to say?”</p><p>The elder of the Dragon Punishment Hall looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>of course I have something to say, because Xu long is being controlled by someone …</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming explained the mission of this trip.</p><p>This time, it was more clear than the previous time. Of course, Lu Ming had skipped over some important points or modified them slightly.</p><p>For example, when elder mo hun chased after Lu Ming, Lu Ming used the prison-suppressing stele to destroy his physical body. Lu Ming did not mention this. He only said that the other party was seriously injured and could not catch up with him.</p><p>“What did you just say? Evil spirit?”</p><p>When Lu Ming finished speaking, a terrifying aura emanated from the Dragon Punishment Hall’s elder, and a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p>“Yes, elder!”</p><p>Lu Ming bowed, but he was shocked.</p><p>When Lu Ming mentioned the evil spirit cult, the elder’s eyes were filled with fear. This fear was similar to Xu Long’s back then, it was from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>He looked around and saw that many of the Dragon God Valley disciples had a look of fear in their eyes after hearing about evil spirit.</p><p>“An elder of evil spirit, an elder of evil spirit is still alive? Could it be that evil spirit is going to rise from the ashes?”</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace’s elder muttered to himself as the fear in his eyes grew.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re talking nonsense. The evil spirit cult was annihilated by the combined forces of countless forces on the mainland eighty thousand years ago. What elder of the evil spirit cult? he’s been alive for eighty thousand years. That’s all Bullsh * t. The dead can’t prove anything now. You can deny it however you want!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted as his eyes flashed with ruthlessness.</p><p>Today, he had to take this opportunity to kill Lu Ming, or at least cripple his cultivation.</p><p>“Lu Ming, do you have any witnesses for everything you’ve said? Do you have any evidence to prove that everything you said is true? Can you prove your innocence?”</p><p>The Dragon Punishment Hall elder took a deep breath to calm himself down and looked at Lu Ming again.</p><p>the evidence is very simple. There are still many people alive in the Feng family, so there must be someone who knows the inside story. Find the Feng family and ask them. Then, you will know whether what I said is true or not!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
