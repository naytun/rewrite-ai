Now, Lu Ming saw him with his own eyes.</p><p>That huge figure was obviously a great emperor.</p><p>“Shakyamuni annihilating soul, even if I die, I will drag you down with me!”</p><p>The goshawk said.</p><p>hahaha, dragging me down with you? in your dreams. So many people have entered this secret realm. They are competing and killing each other. How many vengeful spirits, evil Qi, and soul Qi have they produced? I have absorbed these soul Qi and have recovered a little. Even if it’s only a little, it’s enough to suppress you. In addition, there are some Young heaven’s pride experts who are about to reach this place. As long as I devour and refine their flesh and blood, my Yuan Qi will recover a little. Emperor Cang, that will be the day of your death!</p><p>Emperor Cang, I’ve prepared a huge tomb for you sixty thousand years ago. Even if you put up a stubborn resistance and fought against me for sixty thousand years, what’s the use? the outcome is already decided, even the heavens are on my side!</p><p>The huge figure laughed.</p><p>At this moment, countless thoughts emerged in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Through the conversation between Emperor Cang and that figure, many doubts in Lu Ming’s heart were resolved.</p><p>It was said that Emperor Cang had disappeared 60000 years ago and there was no news of him since.</p><p>From the looks of it, Emperor Cang met with a strong enemy and fought with him for 60000 years.</p><p>As for Emperor Cang’s subordinates, many of the skeletons that Lu Ming had found previously were most likely killed by powerful enemies.</p><p>This opponent was also a great emperor. He was extremely powerful and engaged in an earth-shattering battle with Emperor Cang. In the end, both of them were injured.</p><p>However, what shocked Lu Ming was that Emperor Cang and the huge figure were still fighting even though both of them were injured. They had been fighting for sixty thousand years.</p><p>The power of a great emperor was truly unimaginable.</p><p>Now, the barging of Lu Ming and the rest seemed to have broken the deadlock.</p><p>“Before this …”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Previously, in the stone room where he obtained the black feather wings, there was an Eagle that was formed to stop him from moving forward. That should be Emperor Cang’s Eagle.</p><p>The black shadow behind him, who was fighting with Emperor Cang, should be the giant figure in front of him, Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>Emperor Cang did not want Lu Ming and the others to continue, but Shakyamuni annihilating soul wanted them to continue because he wanted to refine their flesh and blood.</p><p>Many thoughts appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>At that moment, the huge black shadow looked at Lu Ming again and said in a loud voice, ” “Why are you alone? Alright, I’ll refine you first and wait for the others …”</p><p>Then, a huge hand grabbed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Without thinking, Lu Ming turned and ran.</p><p>However, the huge hand was so huge that it covered the sky and the sun. Moreover, the aura that it exuded was extremely terrifying. In an instant, Lu Ming felt as if his body was about to explode.</p><p>The chaos realm covered his entire body and trembled continuously. Dragon roars could be heard from within his body. It was as if Nine Dragons had emerged from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Chaos Domain! It’s actually the chaos Domain!</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul’s voice was filled with shock.</p><p>the primal Chaos Domain. A prodigy like this should be exterminated!</p><p>Dharma King annihilating soul’s voice was filled with killing intent.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>With a long cry, a huge wing swept out, as if it wanted to split the entire starry sky. It struck the huge palm and destroyed it.</p><p>“Emperor Cang, you are courting death!”</p><p>The light on Shakyamuni annihilating soul’s body shone brightly. Like a god, he charged towards Emperor Cang.</p><p>Emperor Cang let out a long cry and fought with Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>The scene of the two of them fighting in the starry sky was too terrifying. The stars would be destroyed and the starry sky would shatter.</p><p>Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul were still extremely far away from Lu Ming. However, the aura of the battle made it hard for Lu Ming to breathe. He felt extremely oppressed.</p><p>great emperor, this is the great emperor. He’s too powerful. Emperors are like ants in front of him. No, even Saints are ants!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered to himself and retreated rapidly.</p><p>There was no way out in this starry sky. He couldn’t see the tunnel he had come from.</p><p>Lu Ming could only retreat and try to stay away from the two great emperors.</p><p>little guy, since you’ve come here, your fate has already been decided. You’ll become my nourishment!</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul’s voice rang out. A jet-black ray of light shot across the boundless starry sky and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming seemed to be fixed in place. He could not move at all.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At this moment, the bubble appeared. It chirped and waved its claws rapidly. The space around Lu Ming was filled with cracking sounds. Lu Ming felt his body relax and he could move again. He flapped his black wings and at the same time, the energy of the air-frozen bead between his brows surged into Lu Ming’s body. Lu Ming’s figure retreated frantically.</p><p>Even if he was facing a great emperor, Lu Ming would not wait helplessly for his death. Even if the chances of survival were small, he would fight for it.</p><p>the space-time spirit rat, one of the top ten, is still alive. He should be killed!</p><p>The killing intent of Shakyamuni annihilating soul was extremely strong.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Emperor Cang roared and spat out a ray of light. It blocked the ray of light that Dharma King annihilating Soul Shot at Lu Ming.</p><p>Emperor Cang, you can’t stop him. Even if I don’t kill you today, I’ll kill the brat who comprehended the chaos Domain and the space-time spirit rat!</p><p>The voice of the soul destroying Royal technique contained boundless killing intent.</p><p>At this moment, there were at least a dozen black rays of light that shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“So many?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted rapidly.</p><p>Although Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul were severely injured and had been fighting against each other for sixty thousand years, they were still extremely terrifying existences to Lu Ming. They could easily kill him.</p><p>Emperor Cang let out a long howl and flapped his wings. A dozen feathers flew out like a dozen divine swords and blocked the rays of black light.</p><p>But in the end, Shakyamuni annihilating soul had the upper hand. There was still a ray of black light that dodged Emperor Cang’s attack and shot towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubble shouted loudly. He opened his mouth and spat out a transparent bubble that suddenly appeared in front of him. It enveloped the jet-black Radiance, hoping to block it.</p><p>However, as the black light flew past, the transparent bubble shattered.</p><p>Although bubbles was a space-time spirit mouse and could control space-time, his cultivation base was far too inferior to the other party’s, so he was completely useless.</p><p>The black light did not stop and shot toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt as if all the blood in his body had frozen. He could not move his body at all.</p><p>“Am I going to die Here?”</p><p>A thought emerged in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>The great emperor was too powerful. He was the pinnacle expert of the world and the master of the world. Lu Ming stood no chance against such an expert.</p><p>No matter how unwilling he was, the difference was too big, too big!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
