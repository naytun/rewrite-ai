They were not the leaders of the younger generation of their sects.</p><p>In the younger generation of each sect, many people had already broken through to the martial Royal realm. Many geniuses were in the martial Royal realm, and some people were even more talented than them.</p><p>This time, the great emperor secret realm was their opportunity. If they could obtain an inheritance, they would be able to win the competition among the younger generation.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao were flying aimlessly.</p><p>They did not have any clues to find the inheritance, so they could only rely on luck.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In front of him, there were a few beams of light that were heading in one direction.</p><p>The three of them didn’t pay much attention to it. However, after that, they saw rainbow lights flying by from time to time. Moreover, they were all flying in the same direction.</p><p>The three of them were very curious.</p><p>At this moment, another figure flew past. Lu Ming stopped the other party.</p><p>What a coincidence, this person was also a disciple of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>the land of inheritance might appear ahead!</p><p>The disciple of the Dragon God Valley only left a few words before he left in a hurry.</p><p>“The land of inheritance?”</p><p>The eyes of the three people lit up.</p><p>It seemed that someone had found the land of inheritance.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The three of them flew in that direction at high speed.</p><p>After flying for more than an hour, the terrain gradually became desolate. Although the terrain was flat, there was no vegetation.</p><p>The three of them continued flying.</p><p>“There’s someone in front!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying pointed to the front.</p><p>In front of him, there was a person lying there, motionless.</p><p>The three of them flew over and found that the man was already dead. The air was filled with the faint smell of blood.</p><p>how did this person die? there’s no wound at all!</p><p>Qiu Hao said after checking.</p><p>“It’s in the dantian!”</p><p>Lu Ming found an extremely tiny hole on the person’s clothes in his dantian. When he undid the person’s clothes, he discovered that there was also an extremely tiny hole in his dantian. It seemed to have been pierced by some sharp weapon. It was a fatal blow, and even the spiritual God could not escape.</p><p>The three of them looked around and continued to move forward. However, not long after, the three of them stopped.</p><p>This time, they saw a few corpses. After checking, they found that the cause of death of each corpse was the same. Their dantian had been pierced by a sharp weapon, and they were all killed in one blow.</p><p>Judging from the auras left behind, these people should all be at the Supreme-being realm.</p><p>The three of them continued on their way, but not long after, they were shocked.</p><p>Corpses. The path was covered with corpses.</p><p>There were thousands of corpses in a certain area. Each of them had died in the same way. Their dantians had been pierced through. Some of them were even Emperor level figures.</p><p>As they moved forward, they saw more corpses. There were at least five thousand of them.</p><p>There were so many people here, and they were all geniuses. Any one of them would be a top existence in the continent of the divine Ruins, but now, they had died here without a sound.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed inwardly. The yuan continent was indeed many times more dangerous than the continent group of the divine Ruins.</p><p>“What is this place? Why is he so evil?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s little face turned pale, and she was a little frightened.</p><p>what kind of existence could kill so many people with the same kind of wound? this is unbelievable!</p><p>Qiu Hao’s heart was pounding.</p><p>Such a scene was too evil, anyone would be scared.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud explosion in front of them. A figure charged into the sky and then dove down.</p><p>“Get lost, get lost!”</p><p>The figure let out an angry roar. The saber in his hand slashed out in all directions with shocking power.</p><p>so strong! This person is not weaker than Yin Feng!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying exclaimed.</p><p>Such a powerful figure seemed to be in a fatal crisis at this moment. He was killing and slashing out bright Saber Light.</p><p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p><p>His Saber Light slashed out, and there was actually a ding ding sound in the air.</p><p>“That is … It’s a type of butterfly!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying suddenly pointed to the front and exclaimed.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming and Qiu Hao also saw it.</p><p>There was a type of butterfly that was almost transparent. It was astonishingly fast as it shuttled through the air. If one didn’t look closely, one wouldn’t be able to see it.</p><p>Furthermore, this type of butterfly had two spikes on its tail that were like two extremely small swords.</p><p>Sword tail plate!</p><p>Three words appeared in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>The swordtail plate was an extremely terrifying insect.</p><p>This kind of vicious insect was almost transparent and its speed was shocking. It moved without a shadow and there were two sword-like spikes on its tail. The attack and penetration power of these spikes were terrifying and they were extremely fast. Ordinary people would be pierced by the spikes and die on the spot before they could even notice.</p><p>That was how the sword tail plate got its name.</p><p>Lu Ming finally knew how those people had died. They were killed by the sword-tail disc.</p><p>At that moment, the person in front was being attacked by hundreds of swordtail plates.</p><p>He tried his best to resist. When he saw Lu Ming and the rest, his eyes lit up and he rushed toward them.</p><p>“This guy wants to drag us into this!”</p><p>Qiu Hao said. A Golden Bell appeared above his head, and a curtain of light enveloped him.</p><p>On Qiu Ying Ying’s body, a feather robe emitted a light that also covered her.</p><p>“Go back!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and threw a punch at the other party.</p><p>The terrifying fist force flooded towards the young man.</p><p>“You dare to …”</p><p>The young man shouted angrily.</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips. This person was going to drag them down and Lu Ming did not dare to retaliate?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The young man had no choice but to slash at Lu Ming’s fist force. With a loud bang, the young man was sent flying.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At the same time, the sharp spikes on the tail of the sword-tail dish stabbed toward the young man, leaving a few small holes in his body. Fortunately, they did not hit any vital parts.</p><p>The young man rushed into the sky and flew into the distance. His voice came from afar, ” “Just you wait!”</p><p>Then, he disappeared into the horizon. A group of swordtail plates chased after him.</p><p>However, the young man had indeed successfully dragged Lu Ming and the rest into the water.</p><p>At least half of the swordtail disc that was originally attacking the young man was now heading toward Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Sharp air-piercing sounds were heard. Hundreds of sharp spikes were aimed at Lu Ming and the other two.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming activated his chaos realm. The chaos realm spread out and enveloped all the swordtail plates.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming pressed down with one hand, and the terrifying power of the chaos realm crushed toward the swordtail plates.</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain weighed hundreds of millions of catties, and the pressure it exerted was astonishing.</p><p>The spikes exploded in the air, and so did the swordtail plates, crushed to death by the chaos Domain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
