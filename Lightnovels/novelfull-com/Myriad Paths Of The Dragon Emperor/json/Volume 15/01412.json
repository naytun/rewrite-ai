Therefore, it was the most terrifying when undergoing tribulation.</p><p>...</p><p>However, the area of Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud had already exceeded that of an ordinary connate spirit body.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud’s range had reached two hundred miles.</p><p>Thick dark clouds filled the air above their heads, covering the sky and the sun. This kind of aura made people feel that a great disaster was coming.</p><p>In the dark clouds, bolts of lightning were swimming. Some of them were as large as mountains and were extremely huge. In front of them, Lu Ming seemed very small.</p><p>In the distance, more and more people were alarmed by the Tribulation clouds.</p><p>In the crowd, there was a person who looked at Lu Ming under the Tribulation cloud with a cold gaze.</p><p>He was Liu Yan of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Senior brother liuyan, is this the person you were talking about?”</p><p>Beside Liu Yan, a few disciples of the heavenly God sect asked.</p><p>that’s right, it’s this person. So he’s here to pass the Tribulation and become a sovereign. Then let his beautiful dream come true!</p><p>Liu Yan coldly said.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother liuyan, are you planning to kill him while he is undergoing his tribulation? It’s too dangerous!”</p><p>A disciple of the heavenly God sect said with a grave expression.</p><p>If he was dragged into the other party’s tribulation, he would also suffer.</p><p>it doesn’t matter. I’ve just become an Emperor, and I’ve also gone through a major tribulation. A tribulation can’t do anything to me. Besides, I still have a tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure with me. I’ll kill him when he’s going through the Tribulation and make his dream of becoming an Emperor vanish!</p><p>Liu Yan said.</p><p>that’s right. Senior apprentice brother liuyan has already transcended the innate spirit body tribulation, which is an extremely terrifying Heavenly Tribulation. Coupled with the Tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure, there’s indeed no harm in it!</p><p>“This brat is dead for sure!”</p><p>A few of the heavenly God sect’s disciples began to flatter him.</p><p>Liu Yan’s eyes flashed with ferocity.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The sky and earth rumbled. More and more lightning appeared in the dark clouds, constantly cutting through the sky and illuminating the world.</p><p>Si la!</p><p>Suddenly, a bolt of lightning streaked across the void and struck down on Lu Ming.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation had begun!</p><p>Lu Ming looked up at the sky and stood still, allowing the lightning to strike him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning landed on Lu Ming’s body, causing his body to go numb. A numbing sensation spread throughout his body.</p><p>“It feels good, let’s do it again!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a look of anticipation.</p><p>He wanted to use lightning to form a spirit body.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, a bolt of lightning struck down from the sky one after another, striking towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of the lightning bolts were as thick as mountains and completely drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>The people around them watched quietly.</p><p>They all knew that the heavenly Tribulation wasn’t very strong at the beginning, but it would get stronger and more terrifying later on.</p><p>Endless lightning drowned Lu Ming. He did not know how many lightning bolts had struck down.</p><p>“It feels so good!”</p><p>Lu Ming did not use the early stage of the chaos Domain. He did not even use his essential core to resist. He only used his physical body to resist the lightning tribulation. As the lightning struck down, Lu Ming’s body felt numb and itchy.</p><p>His spirit body continued to strengthen and condense under the tempering of the lightning tribulation.</p><p>After a few minutes.</p><p>The lightning in the sky suddenly stopped and did not strike down.</p><p>However, this did not mean that it was over. Everyone knew that the truly powerful and terrifying lightning was about to descend.</p><p>The aura in the sky became even more oppressive, and dark clouds rolled as if they were brewing.</p><p>After a long while.</p><p>Si la, si la …</p><p>Another bolt of lightning struck down.</p><p>However, the lightning this time was very different from the previous ones.</p><p>This time, the color of the lightning was deeper and it looked more terrifying.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Bolts of lightning drowned Lu Ming. From the outside, Lu Ming’s figure could not be seen at all. All they could see was a ball of white light.</p><p>This kind of lightning was very dangerous for geniuses who were breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm. They had to do their best to resist it, and there was a risk of death if they were not careful.</p><p>An ordinary person could become an Emperor after passing this level of lightning tribulation.</p><p>this kid’s combat strength is very strong. There’s still one more level of tribulation lightning, the purple flame tribulation lightning. That’s the time for me to attack!</p><p>In the crowd, Liu Yan’s mind was spinning with thoughts, but he did not start attacking.</p><p>This time, Lu Ming did not resist. He simply blocked it with his spirit body and circulated the Dragon God combat body to condense his physical body.</p><p>this power is more like it. The one just now was too weak!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself,’let the lightning tribulation strike me.’</p><p>If this was heard by others, they would probably spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>To others, it was a fatal threat. However, to Lu Ming, it was just an ordinary threat. He did not need to resist at all. He could block it with his body.</p><p>After a while, the wave of lightning tribulation ended.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky, and lightning flashed. A purple light spread out.</p><p>as expected, there’s more. The next wave is the purple fire lightning tribulation. This guy is so strong. He’s going to undergo three lightning tribulations!</p><p>it’s said that an innate spirit body needs to go through four lightning tribulations. I wonder if this guy will have four lightning tribulations!</p><p>I don’t know. This guy’s dark clouds cover 200 miles, which is even larger than the dark clouds of the innate spirit body. There should be four layers, right? ”</p><p>Discussions could be heard all around.</p><p>This time, the Tribulation clouds took even longer to brew.</p><p>Half an hour passed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A bolt of purple lightning streaked across the sky and struck Lu Ming.</p><p>The lightning looked purple because it was covered with a layer of purple fire. It was a tribulation fire, which was as powerful as the lightning tribulation.</p><p>The power of the two combined was even more shocking.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The lightning struck Lu Ming’s body. His body trembled slightly and he blocked the lightning. The lightning tribulation disappeared, but a layer of purple flames burned on Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>This was the terrifying power of the Tribulation fire.</p><p>The Thunder tribulation could be extinguished, but the Tribulation fire was difficult to extinguish. It would stick to the body of the person undergoing the Tribulation until the person was burned to ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body lit up with vital essence and began to resist the invasion of the Tribulation fire.</p><p>BOOM! Boom …</p><p>Following that, bolts of purple lightning tribulation struck down continuously and drowned Lu Ming.</p><p>At that moment, a figure dashed towards the place where Lu Ming was undergoing his tribulation like a bolt of lightning. Many people were shocked.</p><p>“Who is that? What do you want to do?”</p><p>“That’s Liu Yan from the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>“He’s going to charge into the other party’s tribulation transcendence?”</p><p>Flowing flame’s breakthrough caused many people to be shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Flowing flame directly charged into the Tribulation cloud’s area of effect.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>As soon as he charged in, a bolt of purple lightning struck towards Liu Yan. However, Liu Yan casually waved his hand and the purple lightning was destroyed.</p><p>He had just gone through a lightning tribulation, so this purple flame lightning tribulation couldn’t do anything to him.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Immediately after, even more purple lightning bolts struck toward Liu Yan.</p><p>A layer of terrifying flames appeared on Liu Yan’s body to block the lightning.</p><p>He was breaking through the lightning tribulation and approaching Lu Ming.</p><p>“Flowing flame!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Liu Yan actually wanted to kill him while he was undergoing his tribulation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
