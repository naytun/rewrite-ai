It could help one break through a bottleneck.</p><p>In the Martial Emperor realm, if one wanted to improve their cultivation, they first needed to improve their territory, then cultivate their vital essence, and form a spirit body.</p><p>However, the Royal fruit could directly raise one’s cultivation by one level.</p><p>The most amazing thing was that no matter what field a warrior cultivated in, it would be useful when consumed.</p><p>Such a treasure was simply heaven-defying.</p><p>It was no wonder that these people were so busy fighting over it.</p><p>“The three Royal fruits are mine!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and pounced toward the Royal fruit.</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain he cultivated was dozens or even hundreds of times more difficult to level up than ordinary domains. However, if he had the Royal domain fruit, how much time and energy could he save?</p><p>Such a rare treasure was hard to come by. Since he had encountered it, how could Lu Ming give it up?</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“You want to take the Royal fruit? die!”</p><p>The four people who were in the midst of a chaotic battle had also discovered Lu Ming. They roared angrily and attacked Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>The combat strength of these four people was very shocking and had surpassed people like Yin Feng. Even Lu Ming could not ignore the four of them when they attacked in anger.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw four consecutive punches, crushing the attacks of the four people.</p><p>“What powerful strength!”</p><p>The four of them were shocked when they saw that Lu Ming had destroyed their attack with just a wave of his fist.</p><p>we’re no match for this man’s combat strength alone. If he gets the Royal fruit, we’ll have no hope at all!</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>that’s right. Why don’t we join forces and kill this man first before we fight for the Royal fruit? ”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing!”</p><p>The four young men moved in a flash and surrounded Lu Ming in the middle. Powerful steam engines were released and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming bellowed, forming a terrifying sound wave that attacked a young man in front of him.</p><p>At the same time, he threw a punch at the young man in front of him.</p><p>If he wanted to fight, he had to focus on one person!</p><p>The young man’s expression changed. He did not expect that Lu Ming would dare to make the first move against the four of them. Sword Qi bloomed in his hand. A sharp sword Qi burst out and broke the air wave that Lu Ming spat out.</p><p>However, when his sword gleam slashed at Lu Ming’s fist, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>As the primal Chaos Domain crushed down, his sword-light was like a willow leaf in the wind, rapidly swaying as if it would collapse at any moment.</p><p>At this moment, the other three people also made their moves.</p><p>The saber beam, the palm print, and the Spear’s gleam were all aimed at Lu Ming at the same time.</p><p>However, Lu Ming pretended not to see it.</p><p>The chaos realm covered his entire body, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three attacks landed on the chaos Domain. The chaos Domain shook violently but did not break.</p><p>The expressions of the three people changed drastically.</p><p>what kind of domain is this? how can it be so terrifying? ”</p><p>The same thought flashed through the minds of the three.</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain was a legendary domain. Not many people could recognize it. Furthermore, they had never imagined that someone in the world could cultivate the primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>The trio’s attacks did not break the chaos Domain, but Lu Ming’s attack continued to crush it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword light of the youth in front of him finally couldn’t hold on any longer and collapsed.</p><p>&Nbsp; the primal Chaos Domain exploded with terrifying fist energy.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The young man’s body shook violently and he spat out a large mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying like a cannonball.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming dodged the other three’s attacks in a flash. His cold killing intent enveloped the other three.</p><p>At this moment, the sword Pagoda not far away let out a buzzing sound. The door at the bottom level of the pagoda opened with a loud bang.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>At this moment, two sword lights flew toward the sword Pagoda from another direction at an extreme speed and rushed into the gate.</p><p>The sword Pagoda opened and two experts rushed in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s third Blood Meridian emerged and turned into a blood-red spear. Lu Ming grabbed it.</p><p>Army obliteration!</p><p>The blood-red spear swept out, containing the terrifying power of the prison suppressing heavenly art and the primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The three young men were sent flying like sandbags. They flew thousands of meters away and spat out blood as they looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. He was almost invincible among those of the same level.</p><p>After sending the three young men flying, Lu Ming dashed toward the Royal fruit. This time, the young men did not dare to stop him. They watched as Lu Ming picked the Royal fruit and put it away.</p><p>After picking the Royal fruit, Lu Ming did not stop. He rushed to the sword Pagoda and entered through the door on the ground floor.</p><p>“Who is this person? What a terrifying combat strength! I’m afraid it’s comparable to the leaders of the thirteen factions!”</p><p>it’s indeed shocking. However, those two sword lights were the two leaders of the sect, Luo Xiang from the life-and-death Sword sect and Wang Xiao from the jiuxiao sword sect!</p><p>this is going to be interesting. Three leaders are fighting for an inheritance. This is going to be interesting. Let’s go and watch!</p><p>Following that, the young men also flew toward the sword Pagoda.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming flew into the sword Pagoda, he realized that the sword Pagoda was filled with sharp sword Qi. There were beams of sword Qi that were slashing at him.</p><p>It was the aftermath of the sword Qi!</p><p>In the sword Pagoda, two people were fighting fiercely. Sword Qi filled the sword Pagoda.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p>One of the two young men was wearing an ordinary black robe and had a handsome face. There was a sword mark between his eyebrows, as if a divine sword would fly out at any time.</p><p>The other person was wearing a cloud robe. He was tall and had a wild aura.</p><p>The two of them were both swordsmen and they both used long swords.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In an instant, the two of them had exchanged dozens of blows. Their long swords collided, and sword Qi raged.</p><p>The cultivation of these two people was actually at the LV 2 martial Royal realm. They were not weaker than he Yu, the leader of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Luo Xiang, this inheritance is mine!”</p><p>The young man in the cloud robe shouted coldly.</p><p>“Wang Xiao, inheritances can’t be obtained with words!”</p><p>Luo Xiang coldly replied.</p><p>At this moment, the two of them saw Lu Ming but their eyes were cold and indifferent. They did not take Lu Ming seriously at all.</p><p>“You guys continue!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. His figure soared into the sky and he rushed to the top of the sword Pagoda.</p><p>There were no staircases in this sword Pagoda. The center of the pagoda was empty, and it led all the way to the top. If one wanted to go up, they would have to rush up from the middle.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>As Lu Ming charged forward, Wang Xiao’s eyes turned cold and a sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming struck out with his palm and dispersed the sword gleam. He did not stop and continued to move upward.</p><p>“You have some ability!”</p><p>Wang Xiao’s eyes turned cold. He gave up on Luo Xiang and became one with his sword. He turned into a beam of sword light and shot up into the sky, stabbing towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly and took nine consecutive steps with the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps.</p><p>The nine steps merged into one, and the sound of a Dragon’s Roar could be heard. It was as if there were Nine Dragons flying out from Lu Ming’s feet, pouncing towards Wang Xiao’s sword light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
