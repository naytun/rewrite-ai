A scorching aura kept surging.</p><p>In the sky, more and more spatial cracks appeared, covering the sky like a spider web.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Some of the spaces actually shattered like glass.</p><p>The sky had collapsed!</p><p>This secret realm was about to be destroyed!</p><p>At this moment, the others had long since rushed out of the secret realm, leaving only Wang Xiao and Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared, his voice filled with despair.</p><p>Now, even if he wanted to rush out, it would be very difficult.</p><p>“Lu Ming, since you’re going to die, let’s die together!”</p><p>Wang Xiao roared madly as he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His divine weapon sword slashed at Lu Ming’s Black wings. His body trembled and he was sent flying backward by the power of the chaos Domain.</p><p>“Who wants to die with you!”</p><p>let’s go, ” Lu Ming said indifferently. He spread his black wings and soared into the sky, flying thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p>However, in front of him were dense spatial cracks, and there was no way out.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At this moment, Paopao cried out and a milky white glow emanated from its body. It waved its claws and a passageway appeared in front of Lu Ming. It was a space-time passageway.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step in and disappeared.</p><p>“No, no, bring me …”</p><p>Upon seeing this, Wang Xiao’s mind completely collapsed as he madly flew towards the spacetime tunnel. However, in the next instant, the spacetime tunnel disappeared, leaving only Wang Xiao’s indignant roar.</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in the sky thousands of miles above. But then, the bubbles repeated the same trick and opened a space-time Tunnel.</p><p>In the yuan continent, with bubbles ‘cultivation, she could not open the spacetime tunnel for too long. It was only a few thousand miles at a time, but it was enough.</p><p>After a few times, Lu Ming saw the light screen again and rushed in.</p><p>……</p><p>Outside the tomb, at the place where Lu Ming and the rest had entered, there was a Saint from each of the thirteen sects and forces. They were waiting quietly with some deacons.</p><p>The huge tomb was also quietly floating in the air.</p><p>Suddenly …</p><p>Behind the tomb, there was a violent rumble in the void.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Then, they heard the long cry of an Eagle. The space started to shake and some places even cracked.</p><p>“What’s that? A Goshawk!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>They saw a huge Goshawk soaring into the sky, breaking through the void.</p><p>that’s not a real Goshawk. It’s a fortress. Could it be Emperor Cang’s bedroom? ”</p><p>“Emperor Cang’s chamber? no way? Could it be that Emperor Cang is not dead?”</p><p>A series of voices sounded.</p><p>The thirteen sages were in disbelief.</p><p>If Emperor Cang had not died and returned, the skies of the Azure continent would have changed.</p><p>However, the huge Goshawk did not break out of the void. Instead, it shattered the void and disappeared in the depths of the void.</p><p>“What happened in the Emperor Cang secret realm?”</p><p>They were filled with doubt, but they could only wait quietly.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Not long after, the gravestone of the tomb suddenly opened, and figures rushed out from it.</p><p>……</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming rushed into the light screen, his surroundings changed. Lu Ming realized that there was a platform in front of him. Many people were standing there and looking in his direction.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>On the platform, Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao, ruan Tian, and the rest were craning their necks to look over. When they saw Lu Ming, they were overjoyed.</p><p>It was obvious that they were worried and had been waiting here.</p><p>Lu Ming flew over and nodded to everyone.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A series of rumbling sounds came from that secret realm.</p><p>Looking at the secret realm from here, one could see a huge ball with mountains and lakes inside. However, at this time, the mountains and lakes had already exploded, and the whole ball was covered with cracks.</p><p>In the end, the entire round ball exploded, and the entire area was in chaos.</p><p>One of the secret realms exploded and returned to chaos, disappearing into the endless void.</p><p>If Wang Xiao hadn’t rushed out, he definitely wouldn’t be alive.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. They randomly chose a passage and went back the way they came.</p><p>Not long after, they returned to the interior of the tomb and found that the door of the tomb had already been opened. They rushed out one after another.</p><p>As soon as he rushed out of the light barrier, he discovered that there were many people moving in the air. As long as they weren’t dead, most of them had already come out.</p><p>The people at the scene took the initiative to divide themselves into thirteen areas. Lu Ming and the others flew towards the Dragon God Valley area.</p><p>“What happened in the Emperor Cang’s Secret realm? Why did it collapse?”</p><p>An old voice was heard, and a Saint couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Many people looked at each other. They did not know why the Emperor Cang Mystic realm collapsed.</p><p>One of Us Must Know that Lu Ming from Dragon God Valley had entered the core of Emperor Cang’s chamber. Then, the changes that happened later on occurred. I speculate that he must have obtained Emperor Cang’s inheritance!</p><p>In the area of the heavenly God sect, Shi Tian was the first to speak.</p><p>“What? Emperor Cang’s inheritance?”</p><p>Many people heard this and looked in the direction of Dragon God Valley with burning eyes, including some of the Saints.</p><p>The inheritance of a great emperor, how tempting was that?</p><p>“Who is Lu Ming?”</p><p>An expert stepped out from the tianshen sect. A terrifying aura emanated from his body. This person was the sage expert of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Shi Tian pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Is this true?”</p><p>Said a Saint from another sect.</p><p>“I can testify that everything Shi Tian said is true!”</p><p>Mo Jie of the Tian Yu demonic sect stepped forward and looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.</p><p>“I can also testify! I personally saw him enter the core of Emperor Cang’s bedroom!”</p><p>Another leading genius of the sect walked out.</p><p>“In that case, hand over the inheritance of the great emperor!”</p><p>The eyes of the sage realm expert of the tianshen sect flickered as he stared at Lu Ming. He took a step forward and was about to approach Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>On the side of Dragon God Valley, elder Hong took a step forward and stood in front of Lu Ming. Like a tall mountain, he blocked the aura of the sage of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“What’s wrong? If you want to protect him, how can Dragon God Valley monopolize the inheritance of the great emperor?”</p><p>The sage realm expert of the heavenly God sect spoke.</p><p>The other sects also sent their Saint realm experts over.</p><p>I didn’t obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming opened his mouth and his voice spread throughout the entire venue.</p><p>“You didn’t get it?”</p><p>The eyes of all the Saint realm experts narrowed.</p><p>nonsense. Many of us saw you enter the core of Emperor Cang’s Palace. You still want to deny it? ”</p><p>Shi Tian shouted.</p><p>I can also vouch for this. Junior Brother Lu Ming has indeed entered the core of Emperor Cang’s bedroom!</p><p>A cold voice came from the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>It was he Yu!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
