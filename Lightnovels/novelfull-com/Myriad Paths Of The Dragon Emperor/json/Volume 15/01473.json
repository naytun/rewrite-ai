His combat strength far exceeded that of a Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert. Moreover, Jin Yu’s spiritual body was definitely not simple. This could be seen from the expressions of the other disciples of the sky demon sect.</p><p>“Mo Yu!”</p><p>Jin Yu extended a hand and pressed in the air. His domain spread out.</p><p>The demonic Qi domain continued to expand and spread toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The domains were layered and contained endless demonic Qi. There were even feathers that looked like swords flying in the air.</p><p>it’s senior brother Jin Yu’s devil feather domain!</p><p>it’s said that senior Jin Yu’s territory has already reached level five!</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>demonic feather domain, what a wonderful domain!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered.</p><p>There were tens of millions of domains in the world, and one could see it in any domain.</p><p>Some heaven’s pride experts who had comprehended many kinds of intent realms before they reached the Martial Emperor realm might be able to form some wonderful domains after they broke through.</p><p>For example, some people who had comprehended the Wind and Fire concepts before reaching the Martial Emperor realm could condense the Wind and Fire domain after breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm. The power of the domain would be more powerful than a single domain.</p><p>Jin Yu’s demonic feather territory was obviously a mixed territory. Moreover, it was a level five territory, which was beyond his cultivation level. Its power was absolutely shocking.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He pressed his palm against the void and the chaos Domain spread out, expanding rapidly.</p><p>He was going to use the chaos Domain to resist the other party’s devil feather domain.</p><p>haha, this kid is overestimating himself. He wants to use his domain to fight against senior Jin Yu’s domain!</p><p>“Just watch, he’s about to be defeated. Senior Jin Yu’s demonic feather territory is at level five, while he’s only at level two. I can’t even hold on for a breath!”</p><p>At the side, some young men sneered.</p><p>A second rank domain against a fifth rank domain, was that even possible?</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two domains collided, causing the void to shake. Then, their domains intertwined and clashed fiercely.</p><p>One, two, three …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten breaths had passed!</p><p>Their domains were still entangled in an intense battle.</p><p>Some of the young men from the sky demon sect stiffened. Their eyes were wide open as they glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>A second rank territory could actually resist a fifth rank devil feather territory. From the looks of it, it was difficult to determine the winner in a short time. How was this possible?</p><p>What kind of domain was this? how could it be so terrifying?</p><p>“Is a fifth ranked domain really that great? Break!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly said coldly and pressed down with one hand again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain trembled as it weighed hundreds of millions of catties, suppressing everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Jin Yu’s expression changed drastically. His devil feather domain collapsed with a loud bang. His body trembled and he could not help but take three steps back.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The others were dumbfounded.</p><p>Jin Yu’s face was extremely gloomy!</p><p>In the confrontation of domains, he was actually defeated. He was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>A fifth-level territory was no match for Lu Ming’s second-level territory. This made his killing intent surge.</p><p>Initially, he wanted to perform well in front of Xie nianqing and trample on Lu Ming so that Xie nianqing would see how vulnerable Lu Ming was. He wanted Xie nianqing to see that he was the real genius and would have a whole new level of respect for him.</p><p>But now, his fifth-level territory was no match for Lu Ming’s second-level territory. It could be said that he had lost all his face.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Demonic Qi surged from Jin Yu’s body, and terrifying demonic true essence spread out of his body.</p><p>kid, a domain is only one of a martial artist’s combat powers. It doesn’t represent all of a martial artist’s combat power. Now, I’ll let you see what true combat power is!</p><p>Jin Yu let out a long cry. His spirit body glowed and demonic Qi surged. A demonic blade flew out from between Jin Yu’s eyebrows and was held in his hand.</p><p>what a joke. Territory doesn’t represent all combat power. If you have the ability, suppress your cultivation to the LV 2 martial Royal realm and I’ll defeat you with one move!</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was filled with mockery.</p><p>In the beginning, Jin Yu wanted to suppress him with his domain. After his domain was no match for Lu Ming, he said that the domain did not represent his full combat power. How ridiculous was that?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Hmph! Jin Yu snorted coldly. His face turned even colder as he slashed down with the demonic blade in his hand.</p><p>A ray of saber radiance pierced through the sky. It was unknown how long it was, but it came down on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated his essential core to the maximum and his muscles bulged. There were wisps of chaotic Qi shuttling through his muscles, increasing the power of his spirit body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard from Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming charged forward. His Chaos Domain burst forth and he threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The punch landed on Jin Yu’s saber radiance. With a deafening boom, Lu Ming’s body trembled and his Chaos Domain trembled violently. With a Swoosh, his body was sent flying.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming retreated a thousand meters away. He felt a burning pain on his fist. At the same time, the qi and blood in his body were boiling.</p><p>Jin Yu’s spiritual body was definitely a medium-grade earth spiritual body, the same as mo Jie’s. His cultivation had reached the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm, and his combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>A heaven’s favorite like Jin Yu could easily fight above his level. He could easily kill a Lv 5 martial Royal realm or even stronger.</p><p>“Haha, that brat is no match!”</p><p>Many people laughed.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming was no match for them. They heaved a long sigh of relief. Previously, they were suppressed by Lu Ming and they felt very aggrieved.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Behind them, Xie nianqing looked worried.</p><p>“Thousand splitting demon saber!”</p><p>The Golden feather pushed Lu Ming back with one strike and took advantage of the situation to slash at Lu Ming again.</p><p>As the energy of the air-frozen bead gushed in, Lu Ming cast the wind element technique. His figure flashed like a floating light and passing shadow, leaving no trace behind as he dodged Jin Yu’s blade gleam.</p><p>Jin Yu frowned and slashed with the demonic blade again. This time, there were three blade auras, blocking Lu Ming’s three escape routes.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s speed was so fast that those with weaker cultivation could barely see his shadow. With a few flashes, he dodged the three blade gleams one by one.</p><p>slash, slash!…</p><p>Jin Yu roared. This time, he slashed out seven vast blade lights in one breath.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was useless. Lu Ming dodged them one by one.</p><p>damn it, kid, you’re just hiding here and there. What kind of skill is that? if you have the ability, then fight with senior brother Jin Yu!</p><p>not bad. You only know how to dodge. What’s the point of that? ”</p><p>Some of the young men shouted unhappily.</p><p>what a joke. When did you guys hear that a martial artist’s movement technique isn’t a part of their combat strength? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in response.</p><p>Those people’s faces turned red.</p><p>Indeed, movement techniques had always been an important part of combat strength.</p><p>Attack, movement, and defense were all part of one’s strength.</p><p>What was the use of brute force if it couldn’t hit anyone?</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>die! Jin Yu roared. The demonic blade was mighty. This time, he slashed out eighteen blade gleams at once. The entire world was shrouded in blade gleams as they slashed toward Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
