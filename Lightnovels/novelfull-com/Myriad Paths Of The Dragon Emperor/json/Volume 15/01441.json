The Saint breakthrough pill pierced through the large hand that Lu Ming had condensed and rushed past.</p><p>Even the huge hand formed by the chaos Domain could not stop the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>...</p><p>the level of my Chaos Domain is still too low!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>He knew that it wasn’t that the chaos realm was useless, but that the level of his chaos realm was too low. It was only a level one realm, so it couldn’t stop the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>Then, the others all made their moves, but none of them managed to get the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming had an idea. Bubbles and dandan appeared on his shoulders.</p><p>The two fellows were still burping, and the smell of medicine was coming out of their mouths.</p><p>“Another spirit herb?”</p><p>As soon as dandan appeared, her eyes were rolling around.</p><p>dandan, bubble, help me get that lousy Saint pill!</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan and bubbles.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Lu Ming had just finished speaking when bubbles waved its pair of small claws.</p><p>The space churned like waves as the bubble danced.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill was flying, but it suddenly seemed to hit a hard wall with a thud.</p><p>The space had been frozen by the bubble.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. As expected of a space-time spirit mouse, bubbles could control time and space. Even in the yuan continent, where space was extremely stable, bubbles could still control space.</p><p>With a wave of her claws, the space around her was controlled and turned into a spatial box, sealing the Saint breakthrough pill within.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he moved his body and rushed over.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Wang Xiao shouted, and a sword light slashed towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. With a wave of his hand, he destroyed the sword ray. The mountain and river diagram appeared between his eyebrows. He was going to put the Saint breakthrough pill into the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Saint breakthrough pill shone brightly. The light was like a sharp sword, breaking the frozen space formed by the bubble in one fell swoop. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it rushed to the side of the stone room.</p><p>On the side of the stone room, there was a passage. The Saint breakthrough pill rushed into the passage directly.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique. With a flap of his black wings, he flew toward the tunnel like lightning.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Behind him, the others were also chasing after him.</p><p>“Dandan, stop them!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan.</p><p>“Leave it to me!”</p><p>Dandan grinned.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed into the passage, dandan opened its mouth. In a flash of light, a shield condensed and blocked the passage.</p><p>Shi Tian was the first to arrive. He punched the shield, but the shield didn’t move at all.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared.</p><p>Following that, the others also rushed over and launched their attacks. However, when their attacks landed on the tortoise shell Shield, they were unable to break it in a short time.</p><p>Dandan had consumed too many spiritual herbs during this period of time, as well as a few half-Saint herbs from before. Her injuries had already recovered, and she had even advanced. The turtle shell Shield that he had condensed with all his strength was not so easy to break.</p><p>damn it, that’s the core. Quickly break the turtle shell!</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Anxious voices rang out as Shi Tian, Wang Xiao, and the others joined forces to attack. The tortoise shield trembled, and it would be broken soon.</p><p>However, to Lu Ming, it was enough that he could block it for a while.</p><p>After Lu Ming rushed into the passage, he did not stop and chased after the Saint breakthrough pill at top speed.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>The bubble shrieked and suddenly flew off Lu Ming’s shoulder. It opened its mouth and a transparent bubble suddenly appeared, enveloping the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill glowed and tried to break through, but it couldn’t break through at all.</p><p>This transparent bubble not only contained the space domain, but also the time domain.</p><p>Next, bubbles flew over and swallowed the transparent bubbles in one gulp. Its furry body flashed and it returned to Lu Ming’s shoulder.</p><p>Then, it obediently opened its mouth, and the broken divine pill flew out.</p><p>Lu Ming reached out and grabbed the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll seal it!”</p><p>Dandan spoke and then waved her claws. Dense inscriptions appeared and wrapped around the Saint breakthrough pill, forming a sealing formation. Not only could it prevent the Saint breakthrough pill from flying around, but it could also prevent the loss of medicinal strength.</p><p>“Saint breakthrough pill!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. He took out a Jade box and put the Saint breakthrough pill in it, putting it away in a storage ring.</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill was priceless. For those who were stuck at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm and could not break through, it was more precious than any holy weapon. Those people would be willing to buy a Saint breakthrough pill even if they had to go bankrupt.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not plan to sell it. Such an item would be of great use if he kept it with him.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the Saint breakthrough pill and looked ahead.</p><p>In front of the passage, there seemed to be traces of light.</p><p>we should be approaching the core of the emperor’s bedroom!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he stepped forward. As for dandan and bubbles, they returned to the mountain and river diagram to continue digesting the medicinal effects.</p><p>It didn’t take long for them to reach the passageway. However, the amazing thing was that when they looked out from the passageway, it was like a starry sky.</p><p>And that light came from the starry sky.</p><p>“Is it really the starry sky outside the passage?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart. He muttered to himself for a moment before he stepped out and walked out.</p><p>The moment Lu Ming stepped out of the passageway, he felt the space around him change. The next moment, he found himself in a starry sky.</p><p>It was a real starry sky. Up, down, left, right, there were stars all around, and he was floating in the starry sky.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>In the starry sky ahead, there were two huge objects.</p><p>One of them was a huge Goshawk.</p><p>This Goshawk was too huge and majestic. It covered the sky and seemed to be even bigger than the stars.</p><p>A pair of huge eyes were looking at Lu Ming.</p><p>It was alive!</p><p>The huge Goshawk was actually alive.</p><p>In front of the goshawk was a human figure. The figure was also extremely huge, like a giant that could support the sky.</p><p>However, this figure’s appearance could not be seen clearly. It was shrouded in a layer of black light and twisted in the starry sky, looking extremely evil.</p><p>The huge figure seemed to be sizing Lu Ming up.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that both the goshawk and the huge human figure seemed to be severely injured.</p><p>One of the goshawk’s wings was missing, and it was covered in wounds. Some of the wounds were even bleeding.</p><p>The huge eyes were very bright, but they seemed a little listless. It was a very strange feeling.</p><p>The giant figure was not any better. It was missing a leg, had claw marks on its body, and even had a large hole in its chest.</p><p>hahaha, Emperor Cang, it seems like you have lost in the end. You have fought against me for 60000 years, struggling to catch your breath, but in the end, I am still slightly stronger. You will eventually be buried here!</p><p>At this moment, the huge figure laughed.</p><p>His laughter was like a thunderclap, rumbling between heaven and earth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
