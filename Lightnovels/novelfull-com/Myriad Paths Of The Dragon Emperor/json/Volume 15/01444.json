These clowns can’t do anything to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his voice was heard.</p><p>...</p><p>presumptuous! Kid, hand over the inheritance of Emperor Cang. Otherwise, I will make sure you die without an intact corpse!</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>All around, the young men were staring at Lu Ming with greedy eyes.</p><p>I’ve already said that I didn’t receive Emperor Cang’s inheritance. Also, let me remind you that if you want to make a move, then you must be prepared to be killed!</p><p>Lu Ming said, a cold murderous intent flashing in his eyes.</p><p>what a joke. There are so many of us here. Let’s see who you can kill.</p><p>Wang Xiao laughed coldly as he stepped forward. Above his head, a battle sword hovered, emitting a terrifying aura. It was a Saint weapon.</p><p>On the other side, Shi Tian stepped out with a Saint weapon above his head.</p><p>Then, demonic Jie did the same, appearing in another direction.</p><p>Other than the three of them, there were three other leaders. They took out their holy weapons and surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>“Three breaths. Lu Ming, I’ll give you three breaths. If you don’t hand over the Thearch’s legacy, you’ll be stuck here forever!”</p><p>Wang Xiao said coldly.</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Then, Shi Tian started counting.</p><p>At the side, the other young men looked at Lu Ming coldly. They were filled with killing intent and were ready to attack at any time.</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>Then, Shi Tian spoke again.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At that moment, black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. With a flap, Lu Ming soared into the sky.</p><p>“He’s trying to escape!”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>Wang Xiao, Shi Tian, and the other six leaders reacted the fastest. They all chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s body, which was in mid-air, suddenly stopped. Then, he changed his direction, passed Shi Tian and the other six, and rushed down.</p><p>“Who said I wanted to escape? Since you want to kill me, then, kill me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and rushed into the crowd below.</p><p>The black wings were like two heavenly blades. With a single slash, more than ten young men were cut in half.</p><p>He killed more than a dozen people in one move.</p><p>attack! Attack together and kill him!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Instantly, countless attacks were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain spread and the black wings covered the chaos Domain. Its power was even more terrifying. With a sweep, some of the attacks were shattered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming charged into the crowd as if he was in a deserted place. He swept his black wings and another dozen people were killed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, the black feathers on the black wings flew out like divine swords and stabbed in all directions.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>One by one, the young men’s foreheads or dantian were pierced through.</p><p>“Ah, ah, No…”</p><p>Shrill screams filled the air. In an instant, more than a hundred people died at Lu Ming’s hands. The smell of blood filled the air.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re an evil demon! You’re killing innocent people! I’ll get rid of you today!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared. His eyes were red. Almost half of the people that Lu Ming had killed were disciples of the tianshen sect.</p><p>“Evil spirit? It’s ridiculous that you’re killing innocents. You’re the ones who started it first. I’ve told you that if you want to kill me, you should be prepared to be killed. Do you naively think that I can’t resist if you want to kill me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s cold voice was heard. He flapped his black wings and dodged Shi Tian and the other leaders, killing the others.</p><p>The rest of the young men, even those with innate spirit bodies, were no match for Lu Ming. One by one, they screamed in pain as they were killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>Their attacks could not cause any damage to Lu Ming.</p><p>The ground was covered with corpses. Soon, hundreds of people had died at Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>Outside the crowd, Yin Feng and the others gasped.</p><p>this guy is getting more and more terrifying. I must find a chance to kill him!</p><p>Yin Feng thought to himself.</p><p>“Retreat! All of you, retreat!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared.</p><p>The young men fled in all directions, trying to get as far away from Lu Ming as possible.</p><p>Shi Tian and the other five were pursuing Lu Ming with all their might.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure suddenly stopped.</p><p>Shi Tian’s group of six surrounded Lu Ming again. This time, they focused their attention and locked their auras on Lu Ming, afraid that he would escape.</p><p>“Lu Ming, a demon like you must not be allowed to live in this world!”</p><p>Shi Tian roared.</p><p>“Hurry up and hand over Emperor Cang’s inheritance, and I’ll leave your corpse intact!”</p><p>Wang Xiao said coldly.</p><p>“Hehe, do you really think that I’m afraid of you?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled into a cold smile.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and walked towards Wang Xiao.</p><p>“Let’s attack together!”</p><p>Wang Xiao’s eyes flashed with a hint of fear.</p><p>He did not dare to face Lu Ming alone.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Shi Tian and the others activated their holy weapons one after another. The power of their holy weapons burst out, and they were about to attack Lu Ming.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At this moment, bubbles started chirping on Lu Ming’s shoulder. Suddenly, six transparent bubbles emerged and enveloped Shi Tian and the other six.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared as he charged towards Wang Xiao.</p><p>space-time domain!</p><p>Wang Xiao roared, his heart trembling as he pushed his Saint weapon to its limits.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A shocking sword Qi was slashed out. The transparent bubble trembled and was cut open by the sword Qi.</p><p>The power of a holy weapon was unparalleled. The bubble wouldn’t be able to hold all six of them for long.</p><p>The others also used their Saint weapons to break the bubble.</p><p>However, this short moment was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nine seals of the gate of God, seal!”</p><p>seal! Lu Ming shouted. Five gates of sealing suddenly appeared around Wang Xiao, emitting a brilliant light and sealing him.</p><p>As Lu Ming broke through to the martial Royal realm, he had also achieved a breakthrough in the nine seals of the gate of God and cultivated five gates of sealing.</p><p>The nine seals of the gate of God was a secret technique used by emperors, and it was extremely powerful. With five gates of sealing, Wang Xiao was instantly sealed.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming appeared in front of Wang Xiao, and threw a punch at him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The power of that punch caused Wang Xiao’s heart to tremble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>However, right at this moment, a suit of armour suddenly appeared on Wang Xiao’s body, enveloping him within.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the armor, causing it to tremble. Wang Xiao was sent flying dozens of miles away, slamming into a mountain and coughing up blood.</p><p>“Holy weapon armor!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>This Saint weapon was most likely the one Wang Xiao had been wearing before he entered.</p><p>Lu Ming sighed. These people were really rich. They even had holy weapons and armors.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered as he charged towards Wang Xiao.</p><p>“Catch up to him!”</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>Shi Tian and the rest roared as they charged towards Lu Ming. However, their speed was still slower than Lu Ming’s. As soon as they moved, Lu Ming appeared in front of Wang Xiao.</p><p>“Don’t think that I can’t do anything to you just because you’re hiding in your turtle shell!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly and stepped on it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a single stomp, Wang Xiao’s foot landed on the armour on his body, causing the rocks on the mountain to explode. Wang Xiao’s entire body was embedded within the rocks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
