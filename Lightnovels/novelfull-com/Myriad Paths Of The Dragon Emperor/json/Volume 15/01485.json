At a glance, the sky was covered in snow. The world was white.</p><p>Lu Ming flew toward the outer Valley. With his current status, he naturally would not stop him.</p><p>However, he did not notice that when he had just flown into the outer Valley, there were a few pairs of eyes that were staring at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming is back. He’s not dead. Report to young master!”</p><p>A voice rang out. Someone took out a Jade transmission talisman and sent a message.</p><p>Lu Ming flew towards Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>However, he was stopped by a few young men before he could fly halfway.</p><p>The three young men stood in front of Lu Ming and glared at him with hostility.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you still dare to come back!”</p><p>The young man in the middle looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare to come back? But why are you blocking my way?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>“What is it? “Lu Ming, let me ask you. You went out to complete a mission with my elder brother, Xu long, and the rest. Why are you the only one who came back? my elder brother and the rest did not. Tell me, did you collude with outsiders and kill my elder brother and the rest at the sight of money?”</p><p>A young man in the middle shouted.</p><p>“Xu Long’s younger brother?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered. No wonder he looked similar to Xu long.</p><p>regarding Xu long and the others, I will report to the elders of the hall of mission and explain it clearly!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Explain what? My big brother and the rest must have been killed by you. Now, come with me to the Dragon Punishment Hall and accept your punishment!”</p><p>Xu Long’s brother shouted.</p><p>The commotion here naturally alerted the others. At this time, many passersby came over to watch and discuss.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flashed with a ray of light.</p><p>These people seemed to have planned this long ago.</p><p>Lu Ming had just returned, but these people immediately knew about it and blocked his way. Clearly, someone in the outer Valley had been waiting for his return.</p><p>The purpose was to wait for Lu Ming to come back and launch an attack.</p><p>The first person that Lu Ming thought of was yinfeng!</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing had been sent by Yin Feng.</p><p>The Dragon Punishment Hall was the place of law enforcement in the Dragon God Valley. It was possible that there were people from Yin Feng. If Lu Ming went to the Dragon Punishment Hall, his life would not be in his own hands.</p><p>Why would Lu Ming go to the Dragon Punishment Hall?</p><p>“Get out of the way. I’ve said that there’s something else about Xu long and the others. It has nothing to do with me!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>don’t even think about it. You have to go to the Dragon Punishment Hall with me today!</p><p>Xu Long’s younger brother’s eyes gleamed sharply. He stepped forward and stretched out his hand to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted and took a step forward. Nine Dragons rushed out from under his feet and crashed into Xu Long’s younger brother. Xu long screamed in pain as his body was sent flying and he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward. His body was like a fleeting light and a fleeting shadow. He rushed past and flew towards Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that the death of Xu long and the rest was most likely known to Yin Feng and the rest. They were waiting for Lu Ming to come back, slander him, and deal with him.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming arrived at Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Senior brother Lu!”</p><p>At the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, two ordinary disciples bowed to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded at the two of them and continued to move forward, walking into the depths of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>He wanted to find the cloud Dragon Valley master or Longyuan mountain to explain the mission.</p><p>However, before they could go far, they heard a commotion coming from the entrance of the valley.</p><p>“Get Lu Ming to come out!”</p><p>A furious roar was heard.</p><p>“He’s really fast!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He turned around and walked toward the entrance of the valley.</p><p>At the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, a group of people were blocking the way. Xu Long’s brother was among them.</p><p>Yin Feng was also among them. Behind him was a large group of people. Some of them were wearing Golden Dragon robes and had an imposing aura. They were obviously from the Dragon punishment Palace.</p><p>At this moment, two Cloud Dragon Valley disciples stood in front of the crowd.</p><p>everyone, this is Cloud Dragon Valley. Those who are not from Cloud Dragon Valley are not allowed to enter!</p><p>A disciple said.</p><p>get Lu Ming out here. He colluded with outsiders and took advantage of the mission to murder his fellow disciples. He has committed a heinous crime and must be arrested and brought to the Dragon Punishment Hall for interrogation!</p><p>Yin Feng coldly said.</p><p>everyone, senior brother Lu Ming is the valley master’s direct disciple. Even if something were to happen, the Dragon Punishment Hall’s elders would have to inform the valley master first, and the valley master would then come forward to investigate the matter!</p><p>A Cloud Dragon Valley disciple said.</p><p>“There’s irrefutable evidence of Lu Ming killing his fellow disciples. There’s no need to trouble Cloud Dragon Valley master. Just bring him to the Dragon Punishment Hall. Get lost. Let us go in and capture Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yin Feng berated.</p><p>“No, you can’t barge into Cloud Dragon Valley!”</p><p>Two Cloud Dragon Valley disciples tried to stop him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Behind Yin Feng, a burly young man shouted angrily and struck out with his palm. The two Cloud Dragon Valley disciples groaned and fell back. A trace of blood seeped out of the corner of their mouths.</p><p>“Today, Lu Ming must go to the Dragon Punishment Hall and accept his punishment!”</p><p>Yin Feng berated.</p><p>“You guys are looking for me?”</p><p>A cold voice was heard and Lu Ming’s figure appeared in a flash.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes focused.</p><p>Yin Feng, you’re getting bolder and bolder. You brought people to break into Cloud Dragon Valley and even injured our disciples. It seems that you really don’t respect Cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>“Lu Ming, we’re here to capture you. You were hiding in the cloud Dragon Valley. We had no choice but to barge in!”</p><p>“Lu Ming, it’s good that you’ve appeared. Did you collude with outsiders to kill Xu long, Duan Yan, and the other two?”</p><p>Yin Feng started to quibble and then asked Lu Ming directly.</p><p>“Duan Yan, I didn’t kill Fu Xing and the others!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>“You’re still trying to deny it? Lu Ming, let me tell you, I’ve personally led my men to the Feng residence and found the corpses of Duan Yan, Fu Xing, and Xu long in a cave. Xu long was clearly killed by you, and that was clearly the cultivation technique you used. Also, your aura still remains on Xu Long’s corpse. Are you still going to say that you didn’t kill him?”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted coldly.</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. It seemed that Yin Feng really hated him to the core and wanted him dead. He had actually sent someone to the Feng family to investigate.</p><p>Xu long had indeed been killed by Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain and the prison suppressing heavenly technique.</p><p>But at that time, Xu long wanted to kill him, so he naturally had to kill him.</p><p>Now, Yin Feng had caught on to this point.</p><p>“Yes, I did kill Xu long!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>This made many people’s hearts tremble.</p><p>Yin Feng revealed a look of ecstasy and shouted, ” “Everyone, you heard it, right? Lu Ming himself admitted that he killed Xu long. How can such a vicious person who harmed his fellow disciples be allowed to live in this world? today, the Dragon Punishment Hall must kill this person and avenge Xu long and his fellow disciples!”</p><p>“The Dragon punishment Palace will not let him off for killing his fellow disciples!”</p><p>Behind Yin Feng, a young man from the Dragon punishment Palace Hall coldly said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
