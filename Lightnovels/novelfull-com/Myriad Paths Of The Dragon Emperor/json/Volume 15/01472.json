Once he broke through to the Martial Emperor realm, his cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>However, at the peak of the LV 3 martial Royal realm, his previous accumulation was almost exhausted. His future progress would slow down.</p><p>...</p><p>However, this was enough to make mojie very confident. His cultivation was more than one level higher than Lu Ming’s, almost two levels higher.</p><p>With every step mo Jie took, the aura on his body became stronger. His demonic body was glowing, and demonic Qi was circulating.</p><p>mojie has a rare medium-grade earth spiritual body, and his cultivation has reached the peak of the third level Martial Emperor realm. He’s more than enough to suppress this kid!</p><p>“En, I just don’t know how many moves this kid can block from demonic Jie!”</p><p>Some of the young men from the Tian Yu demonic sect started to discuss.</p><p>“Mojie, you are very confident, but I hope that you won’t be like the previous two!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>The previous two were also full of confidence, but the result was a crushing defeat!</p><p>“Dark Demon fist!”</p><p>Mojie suddenly roared and pounced at Lu Ming like a bolt of lightning. He threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>Wherever the fist force passed, the void trembled, bringing with it a terrifying storm.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly and threw a punch as well.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Their fists collided heavily, like two giant hammers colliding in the air.</p><p>Demonic Qi surged. The moment the two fists collided, mo Jie’s expression changed. With a muffled groan, his body trembled and he flew far away.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The other youths from the Tian Yu demonic sect widened their eyes.</p><p>In a head-on confrontation, demonic Jie was actually forced back.</p><p>Demonic Jie was a medium-grade earth spiritual body. His physical body was extremely strong, but he was knocked back by Lu Ming’s punch. Could Lu Ming also be a medium-grade earth spiritual body?</p><p>A mid-grade earth spiritual body was considered a rare spiritual body in the thirteen top sects of the Azure region.</p><p>“Devil seal of darkness!”</p><p>Mo Jie retreated a hundred meters. His face was dark as he roared into the sky. Demonic Qi exploded from his body like flames. Everything within a hundred meters was covered in demonic Qi.</p><p>A huge palm print formed in the sky, blocking out the sun and bombarding Lu Ming.</p><p>The power was terrifying!</p><p>Mojie’s combat strength was indeed very strong. He was much stronger than the third level Martial Emperor realm martial artist from before.</p><p>Whether it was the strength of his spirit body or the use of his domain martial technique, they were both very shocking. An ordinary peak third level Martial Emperor realm expert would probably not be able to withstand a single move from mo Jie and would be killed.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s expression remained calm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky, his chaos realm enveloping him. He cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art and threw a punch.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body appeared very small in the face of mo Jie’s demonic palm print. However, when Lu Ming’s fist landed on the demonic palm print, the demonic palm print immediately collapsed.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped on the demonic Qi and walked towards mo Jie. His cold voice was heard, ” “Mojie, is this all your combat power? What a disappointment!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Mojie bellowed. The move just now was the combination of his spirit body and his domain technique. It could be said that he had unleashed his combat strength to the peak. However, in Lu Ming’s hands, it could not even withstand a single blow.</p><p>“Nine Dragons trampling the heavens!”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on top of mo Jie’s head. He took nine steps in a row and nine Dragons flew out, roaring and dancing, flying towards mo Jie.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Mo Jie bellowed. His demonic body glowed and his domain covered his entire body. He struck out with his palm and a palm print landed on the nine Dragons, sending them flying. However, Lu Ming had already appeared in front of mo Jie and punched out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mojie was sent flying, spitting out a large mouthful of blood. His chest caved in.</p><p>He lost, mo Jie lost!</p><p>Everyone could tell that if Lu Ming had not shown mercy, mo Jie would have been dead.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too terrifying. Mo Jie, who had a medium-grade earth spiritual body, was actually no match for Lu Ming and was easily defeated even though his cultivation level was in the lead.</p><p>Could it be that Lu Ming had a superior-grade spiritual body?</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled as they thought of this possibility!</p><p>That was impossible!</p><p>Then, they all shook their heads in their hearts.</p><p>There weren’t many upper-class earth spiritual bodies in the entire Azure region. Every one of them was a genius with unparalleled combat strength and was an invincible figure among the younger generation.</p><p>How could Lu Ming have a superior-grade earth spiritual body?</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming did not have a superior-grade earthly spiritual body, but a medium-grade one. However, because Lu Ming had survived the world refining tribulation Bell, there was a faint trace of chaos Qi in his body, which made his physical body far stronger than those of the same grade.</p><p>Although his current spiritual body was a medium-grade earth spiritual body, its power and strength were probably not inferior to that of a high-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming had broken through to the second level of the martial Royal realm and his Chaos Domain had broken through to the second level. His combat strength had increased greatly and he was much stronger than he was in the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>Although the chaos realm was difficult to cultivate and improve, the increase in power with each breakthrough was terrifying.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Demonic Jie roared in his heart and looked at Lu Ming with an extremely gloomy gaze.</p><p>However, Lu Ming ignored him. He swept his gaze across the entire place and said,”Who else wants to come up and fight?”</p><p>The remaining young men from the Tian Yu demonic sect looked at each other with ugly expressions.</p><p>Even demonic Jie was defeated, who could fight him?</p><p>As a medium-grade earth spiritual body, mojie’s combat strength was extremely powerful. It was not easy for a fourth level martial Royal realm genius with an inferior earth spiritual body to defeat mojie. However, Lu Ming had won.</p><p>Therefore, even if an ordinary Lv 4 martial Royal realm with an inferior earthly spiritual body were to attack, it would be difficult for them to defeat Lu Ming.</p><p>Only a fourth level martial Royal realm intermediate earth spiritual body would have the confidence.</p><p>However, there weren’t many Medium Earth spiritual bodies and they didn’t have any here.</p><p>In addition, many of the people here had reached Lv 5 and Lv 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>If the news of him bullying Lu Ming, a Lv 2 martial Royal realm martial artist, with such a low cultivation spread, the younger generation of the sky demon sect would become a laughing stock.</p><p>For a moment, no one made a sound.</p><p>“I’ll test you!”</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard. In the distance, a ray of light flashed and a young figure appeared.</p><p>senior brother Jin Yu! It’s senior brother Jin Yu!</p><p>that’s great! With senior brother Jin Yu’s help, victory is in our hands!</p><p>“Look at that brat, how arrogant he can be!”</p><p>Many people from the Tian Yu demon sect were overjoyed to see this young man.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. This young man was the one who had attacked Lu Ming when he had just arrived at the sky demon sect’s front gate. However, he was interrupted by Liu Yu halfway.</p><p>This person’s cultivation was at the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Jin Yu looked at Lu Ming coldly and said,”Brat, you managed to escape before, but I’ll deal with you now!”</p><p>His voice was cold and arrogant, and he had an arrogant expression on his face.</p><p>The powerful cultivation of the peak of the fourth level martial Royal realm bloomed from his body. A terrifying pressure pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed slightly. The essential core in his body circulated crazily to resist the other party’s aura.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Between the two of them, due to the clash of auras, a loud rumbling sound was produced.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
