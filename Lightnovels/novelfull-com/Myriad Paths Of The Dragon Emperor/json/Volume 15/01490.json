In fact, Yin Feng was the one who killed the Feng family and he pushed the blame to Lu Ming.</p><p>...</p><p>From the beginning to the end, it was yinfeng who wanted to frame Lu Ming and harm him.</p><p>what a vicious junior. He’s acting like this just because he has a good grandfather. Hehe!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sneered. With a wave of his hand, he put away the memory crystal, and the image disappeared.</p><p>As for Yin Feng, he sat on the ground limply as if he had been drained of all his strength.</p><p>After a long time, he finally woke up.</p><p>“Grandpa, save me!”</p><p>After he woke up, Yin Feng shouted loudly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Shut up!” The master of Silver Dragon Valley shouted coldly. I’ve been in closed-door cultivation all these years. I’ve neglected to discipline this grandson of mine. Now, hand him over to me. I’ll definitely discipline him strictly when I return!</p><p>“Strict discipline? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s mocking voice was heard and he continued, ” “Do you think you can offset yinfeng’s crime with a sentence of strict discipline?”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley looked at Lu Ming with cold eyes.”Then what do you want?”</p><p>what Yin Feng has done concerns the entire Dragon God Valley. He must be dealt with according to the sect rules!</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists at the Dragon Punishment Hall elder and said, elder, everyone has seen what yinfeng has done. He’s simply insane and infuriating. According to Dragon God Valley’s rules, how should he be dealt with? ”</p><p>“This …”</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace’s elder started to hesitate and mumble.</p><p>Yin Feng was the grandson of the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley, but Lu Ming was also the legacy disciple of the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley. In addition, there were so many people present. For a moment, he did not know what to do.</p><p>the Dragon punishment Palace should handle this fairly. Otherwise, what’s the use of the Dragon punishment Palace? ”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said coldly.</p><p>At the scene, many pairs of eyes looked at the Dragon punishment Palace’s elder.</p><p>In the end, the Dragon punishment Palace’s elder gritted his teeth and said, ” what yinfeng has done is truly chilling. He has committed a terrible crime and should be executed as a warning to others!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley’s aura went berserk, and a beam of silver light soared into the sky.</p><p>On the other hand, Yin Feng’s expression changed drastically and he shouted, ” “No, no, Grandpa, save me!”</p><p>“If I have to, then I’ll do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. His essential core burst forth and condensed into a combat sword.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you dare?”</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! the master of Silver Dragon Valley bellowed.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I dare?”</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and his combat sword cut through the void, slashing horizontally.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Yin Feng’s head flew far away and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>A spiritual God appeared from Yin Feng’s body in fear. However, with another slash of the combat sword, Yin Feng’s spiritual God let out a miserable shriek and turned into ashes.</p><p>“Feng ‘er!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was furious. A violent killing intent burst out from his body. He stretched out a large hand, trying to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A terrifying sword light bloomed from the cloud Dragon Valley master’s hand. The giant hand collapsed, and the silver Dragon Valley master retreated frantically. However, the sword light did not stop. Instead, it grew in the wind and turned into a sword light the size of a mountain, crushing toward the silver Dragon Valley master.</p><p>&Nbsp; ” die! the master of Silver Dragon Valley bellowed in rage. His entire body was enshrouded in silver light as he kept punching.</p><p>After at least a hundred punches, he finally managed to block the sword light. However, there were a few more hideous sword wounds on his body.</p><p>Pfft …</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley spat out a mouthful of blood, his face pale.</p><p>“So strong! He’s really strong!”</p><p>Many people’s hearts trembled.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was too powerful. The silver Dragon Valley master and the cloud Dragon Valley master were both Masters of the Dragon God Valley’s seven dragons, but they were not his match.</p><p>Yin Zheng, next time, if you dare to attack my disciple again, I, Yun ruoxu, will definitely kill you no matter what! Yun ruoxu said.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s long hair fluttered in the wind, and his eyes were like two divine swords that stabbed at the silver Dragon Valley master.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley had an extremely ugly face. Although he had endless killing intent, he didn’t dare to continue.</p><p>He had no doubt that if he really attacked Lu Ming again, Yun ruoxu, that lunatic, would really kill him.</p><p>“I’m taking Yin Feng’s body with me!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said after a while.</p><p>“Take him away and get lost immediately!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his sleeve.</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley waved his hand and swept Yin Feng’s body away. Then, without a word, he took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, many people at the scene had complicated feelings.</p><p>In the beginning, Yin Feng came menacingly and brought his men to kill Lu Ming. However, he did not expect to lose his life here.</p><p>The world changed so quickly that no one could predict.</p><p>“Good kill!”</p><p>Some people roared in their hearts, only feeling very satisfied.</p><p>Many people knew that Yin Feng used his power to bully others and did many evil things. However, Yin Feng’s grandfather was the master of Silver Dragon Valley, the Overlord of Dragon God Valley. Who would dare to say anything?</p><p>He was angry but didn’t dare to say anything. Now that he was killed, it was really satisfying.</p><p>There were a few people who knew from the images in the memory crystal that their loved ones were also killed by Yin Feng. They were so excited that they were trembling.</p><p>your Dragon Punishment Hall should be properly reorganized. You’ve been used by Yin Feng!</p><p>At that moment, the cloud Dragon Valley master glanced at the Dragon Punishment Hall elder.</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace Hall’s elder immediately trembled with fear. He hurriedly said, Valley master Yun is right. The Dragon Punishment Hall must be reorganized!</p><p>Then, he turned his sharp eyes to the young men of the dragon punishment Palace and scolded, ” “You guys, apologize to Lu Ming!”</p><p>The young men were all trembling in fear as they hurriedly apologized to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He did not care about these people at all and could not be bothered with them.</p><p>there’s also the hall of missions. Hehe, very good. Now, they even dare to tamper with the sect’s missions. It seems that many people don’t take me seriously because I haven’t unsheathed my sword for many years!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master sneered. He took a step forward and disappeared.</p><p>sorry to trouble you. Let’s go back to the Dragon punishment Palace!</p><p>The Dragon punishment Palace Hall’s elder shouted loudly. Then, he led the Dragon punishment Palace Hall’s people and left the place.</p><p>Soon, a shocking piece of news spread in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had stormed into the mission Hall in a fit of anger because of his disciple, Lu Ming. He had killed several deacons who had participated in Lu Ming’s matter on the spot. If the Dragon God Valley master had not arrived in time, the elder of the mission Hall would have been killed by the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>In the end, it was the Dragon God Valley master who smoothed things over, and the cloud Dragon Valley master finally gave up and left.</p><p>After this incident, Cloud Dragon Valley had a new meaning in many people’s hearts.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master was too domineering and overbearing.</p><p>He had injured the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley with a sword, killed several deacons in the mission Hall, and even needed the valley master of Dragon God Valley to come forward to solve the problem.</p><p>Many people now knew that the cloud Dragon Valley master was so powerful.</p><p>Many of the older generation shook their heads and smiled bitterly.</p><p>It would be a wonder if that lunatic wasn’t strong!</p><p>However, the madman’s sword had not been unsheathed for many years, so many people had forgotten about the cloud Dragon Valley master. The silver Dragon Valley master deserved it for provoking the madman.</p><p>It turned out that the madman’s sword was not dull at all. Instead, it was sharper.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
