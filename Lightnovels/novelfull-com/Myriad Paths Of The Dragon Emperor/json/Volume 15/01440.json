This sound was, of course, made by the vibration of energy.</p><p>“Release him!”</p><p>A loud roar was heard, and demonic might surged. A small tower filled with demonic Qi flew out from the top of the young man’s head. It expanded rapidly and pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>A holy weapon! Without a doubt, this small Pagoda was also a holy weapon.</p><p>These people were the leaders of their respective sects. Being able to make it here, they naturally had great gains. Each of them had obtained a Saint weapon.</p><p>The demonic youth was called mo Jie, from the Tian Yu demonic sect. This Pagoda was the Saint weapon he had obtained when he entered the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>Although he couldn’t use much of a holy weapon’s power with his cultivation, it was still stronger than an Emperor weapon.</p><p>The small Pagoda turned into the size of a small mountain and pressed down on Lu Ming. There was a terrifying suction force at the bottom of the pagoda that seemed to be trying to suck Lu Ming in.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>On Lu Ming’s back, one of the black wings flapped out and expanded rapidly. Like a blade, it slashed at the pagoda.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The small tower trembled, and demonic Qi churned as it was sent flying. However, the black wings were suppressed by the small tower, and they also flew back.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a powerful aura burst out from he Yu, Wang Xiao, Shi Tian, and the burly young man. A combat weapon emerged from each of their bodies.</p><p>They were all holy weapons!</p><p>They all used their holy weapons to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression turned grave.</p><p>Without his holy weapon, Lu Ming would not be afraid even if he were to be besieged by six masters. He might even win.</p><p>However, since all of the opponents had used their holy weapons, the effect of their own combat strength was reduced. It became a collision between holy weapons, which was not good for Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s glabella glowed and the lightning cauldron floated out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At this moment, a sword light flashed across the sky, and a Jade box was shattered.</p><p>A jade talisman flew out of the jade box.</p><p>He Yu and the rest surrounded Lu Ming, but the others were not just watching the show. They were chasing after the only two Jade boxes left in the sky.</p><p>The jade box from before contained a Jade armor. It was clear that the treasure in the jade box was definitely more precious.</p><p>As soon as the Jade talismans appeared, the remaining few people began to fight for them.</p><p>The faces of he Yu, Shi Tian and the others changed.</p><p>“Hmph, I’ll spare him this time!”</p><p>Shi Tian said. He was the first to rush into the sky and participate in the fight for the Jade talismans. When the others saw this, they also went to fight for the Jade talismans.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was calm. He did not join in the fun. Instead, he looked at the last Jade box.</p><p>This Jade box was the fastest of the three, and it danced in the air like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly made a move. He stretched out his palm and a huge hand formed, grabbing the jade box.</p><p>However, the jade box was extremely agile. It dodged Lu Ming’s palm in a flash.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming cast the wind element technique in a flash and chased after the jade box like lightning. However, the jade box glowed and its speed suddenly increased, leaving Lu Ming in the dust.</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but curse in his heart. A Jade box was actually faster than him. Was there any justice in this world?</p><p>Lu Ming chased after the jade box. On the other side, the outcome of the battle for the Jade talismans had already been decided.</p><p>In the end, the Jade talisman was obtained by a peerless woman.</p><p>Shi Tian and the others “eyes flickered, but they did not continue to snatch it. Obviously, they were quite afraid of this woman.</p><p>At this time, everyone’s eyes were on the last Jade box.</p><p>Immediately, everyone moved. Their figures moved horizontally and horizontally as they pounced towards the jade box. However, the jade box was extremely agile. It flashed in the air and dodged everyone’s pounce.</p><p>Even when someone used their Saint weapon, it was useless.</p><p>I suggest that we spread out in all directions of the stone room and release our domains to cover this stone room. This way, the jade box will have nowhere to escape!</p><p>Someone suggested.</p><p>“Good! I don’t have any objections. After we get this Jade box, we’ll fight for it with our own abilities!”</p><p>Someone else said.</p><p>No one had any objections, and their figures flickered, scattering in all directions.</p><p>A total of 13 people!</p><p>Originally, there were fourteen people in total, including Lu Ming. However, the green-robed young man was killed by Lu Ming, so there were thirteen people left.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A domain bloomed out from each of the thirteen people. It expanded rapidly and slowly covered the entire stone room.</p><p>The area that the jade box could move in became smaller and smaller. In the end, it had no choice but to be enveloped by the domain.</p><p>“Haha, it’s mine!”</p><p>A young man was overjoyed. It was Shi Tian. The jade box was finally covered by his domain.</p><p>“Get over here!”</p><p>Shi Tian shouted as his territory rapidly contracted.</p><p>The jade box glowed and wanted to escape. Then, with a bang, the jade box exploded, revealing the true appearance of the item inside.</p><p>It was actually a medicinal pill. On it, there was a dense fluorescent light, and a strange phenomenon appeared. The aura of the great Dao lingered.</p><p>Upon seeing this pill, everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>the Saint breakthrough pill, it’s the Saint breakthrough pill. This Saint breakthrough pill is mine!</p><p>Demonic Jie was the first to roar.</p><p>The others also revealed a blazing light.</p><p>It was actually a Saint breakthrough pill!</p><p>Even Lu Ming’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill could help one break through to the martial Saint realm.</p><p>It was extremely difficult for a Martial Emperor to defeat a martial Saint!</p><p>In the yuan continent, there were as many peak-stage martial emperors as there were hairs on an ox. For example, in the 13 top sects of the Azure continent, there were also many peak-stage martial emperors. However, martial Saints were indeed very, very few.</p><p>Only martial Saints could be considered experts in the yuan continent.</p><p>However, even top talents like Shi Tian and he Yu did not have the confidence to break through to the martial Saint realm.</p><p>In history, there had been many outstanding geniuses who had reached the peak of the Martial Emperor realm a long time ago, but had been unable to break through to the martial Saint realm. They had been stuck at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm for their entire lives, and had died at the end of their lifespans. How could they be unwilling?</p><p>The Saint breakthrough pill could increase the chances of breaking through to the martial Saint realm by 30%.</p><p>The probability of 30% was already very terrifying. It would make countless powerhouses at the peak of the Martial Emperor realm fight for it.</p><p>This was especially so for the geniuses. If the probability increased by 30%, they would have a great chance of becoming a martial Saint in the future.</p><p>don’t even think about it. The Saint breakthrough pill just so happens to be in my domain. It’s fated with me!</p><p>Shi Tian roared, and his realm shrank, trying to get the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>However, the Saint breakthrough pill seemed to have a mind of its own. With a shake, it actually broke through Shi Tian’s domain and escaped from his control.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>The others all flew up and pounced towards the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>All kinds of light condensed into large hands that grabbed at the Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>However, the Saint breakthrough pill glowed and flew past them, piercing through the hands and making them miss.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind element technique. The black wings on his back flapped and he pounced at the Saint breakthrough pill as fast as lightning. He appeared a few meters away from the pill in an instant.</p><p>He stretched out his hand, and the chaos Domain condensed into a palm, which grabbed at the Saint breakthrough pill.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
