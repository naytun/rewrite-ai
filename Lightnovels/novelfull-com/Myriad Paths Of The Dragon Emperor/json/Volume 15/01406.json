Hence, she had asked a few heaven’s favorites from the tianshen sect to enter the great Emperor’s Secret realm and help her deal with a few strong enemies.</p><p>...</p><p>How could they refuse to serve the Holy maiden?</p><p>“Bing Kong, Eden, Zi Wuji, you all came from the same continent as the saintess. Who was the person the saintess asked to kill?”</p><p>The young man with the flame mark on his forehead looked at Bing Kong, Eden, Zi Wuji, and Ji hongchen.</p><p>The expressions of the four people changed slightly.</p><p>Eden and Ji hongchen both remained silent.</p><p>“Senior brother Liu, it’s that one!”</p><p>Bing Kong pointed at Lu Ming’s position.</p><p>“Oh, it’s that kid!”</p><p>The young man with the flame mark between his brows and some other young men all looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>Ji hongchen’s face revealed a trace of worry.</p><p>“This kid is mine!”</p><p>The young man with the flame mark on his forehead said casually.</p><p>liuyan, that might not be the case. It’s not that easy to win the saintess’s favor. That kid can be killed at any time. It’ll all depend on our luck. Whoever meets him in the great emperor secret realm is lucky!</p><p>The other young man sneered.</p><p>“Hmph, let’s see who’s lucky!”</p><p>The young man with the flame mark on his forehead snorted.</p><p>In the crowd of Dragon God Valley, Lu Ming naturally saw the scene where Bing Kong pointed at him.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not care. It was fine if these people did not provoke him. If they were courting death, he did not mind sending them on their way.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the distance, another large sect had arrived.</p><p>As time passed, more and more powerful forces and sects arrived. The number of people at the scene grew.</p><p>A few hours later, a total of 13 sects and powers arrived.</p><p>These thirteen sects were the thirteen most powerful forces in the Azure continent.</p><p>Each force had more than 20000 people. In total, they had more than 300000 people.</p><p>In other words, there would be more than 300000 people entering the great emperor secret realm this time. It was a huge number.</p><p>These people were all top heaven’s favorites from the various continents.</p><p>Every force had a Saint realm expert leading them.</p><p>The thirteen Saints stood in the air and waited silently.</p><p>Soon, night fell, and a moon appeared in the sky.</p><p>Blood Moon, this moon was actually blood red.</p><p>A ray of blood-red moonlight scattered from the Blood Moon.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a wave-like ripple appeared in the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the thirteen Saints lit up, and they released a shocking aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The thirteen Saints stepped forward and appeared where the ripples were.</p><p>attention! We are now opening the entrance to the great Emperor’s Secret realm!</p><p>One of the sages said.</p><p>The thirteen Saints ‘auras were so powerful that it was as if thirteen worlds had appeared there.</p><p>At the same time, the thirteen of them made their moves. Thirteen rainbow lights of different colors flew forward and gathered together.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The 13 Saints shouted. BOOM! BOOM! A muffled boom resounded between heaven and earth. The void cracked open, and a huge object appeared.</p><p>At first, it was blurry, but slowly, it became clearer and clearer.</p><p>“That’s …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted.</p><p>What appeared in the void was actually a tomb, a huge tomb. It was incomparably huge, even bigger than a mountain range, and its energy was a million feet high.</p><p>Countless people were shocked. Was this the great Emperor’s Secret realm, or was this the great emperor’s tomb?</p><p>The great Emperor’s Secret realm was the great emperor’s tomb?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a final boom, the huge tomb completely appeared in the sky. It was as high as the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming had never seen such a majestic and huge grave.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>When the tomb appeared, the huge gravestone in front of it moved.</p><p>As he slowly moved towards the first rank, some of the more timid people took a deep breath and couldn’t help but take a few steps back.</p><p>The gravestone moved and finally opened completely, revealing the pitch-black darkness inside.</p><p>“This … Could this be the entrance to the great emperor secret realm?”</p><p>Someone said, his voice trembling.</p><p>If it was a normal tomb, no one would be afraid, but this involved a great emperor, so it was a little creepy.</p><p>that’s right. This is the entrance. Hurry up and enter. If you’re too late, the gravestone will close!</p><p>One of the sages said.</p><p>It really was!</p><p>Some people’s hearts tightened.</p><p>“Hahaha, isn’t it just a tomb? What a cowards!”</p><p>Someone laughed and flew over first.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Then, more people flew in.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>More than 20000 people from Dragon God Valley flew toward the entrance of the tomb in unison. Lu Ming followed the crowd and flew in.</p><p>The entrance to the tomb was huge, and it could accommodate many people at the same time. Soon, everyone flew into the tomb.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>After everyone flew into the tomb, the gravestone rumbled and automatically closed.</p><p>It was pitch-black inside the tomb. One couldn’t even see one’s fingers.</p><p>Even if everyone’s cultivation was high, they could still see in the night. But here, they couldn’t see anything at all, and they were plunged into darkness.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>The next moment, someone condensed a flame, and only then did the tomb have a trace of dim light.</p><p>A ball of flame appeared in Lu Ming’s hand as well. He could barely see the area within a radius of tens of meters.</p><p>“Brother Lu!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s voice was heard as she walked towards Lu Ming. Beside Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao was also there.</p><p>“Young lady Qiu, brother Qiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming greeted the two people.</p><p>“Heaven seat King’s people, gather here!”</p><p>“People of the heavenly God sect, gather here!”</p><p>“People of Dragon God Valley, come here!”</p><p>……</p><p>In the darkness, a series of voices sounded as the disciples of the 13 forces began to gather.</p><p>In such an environment, they would only feel safe when they gathered together.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two also headed in the direction of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“There seem to be many forks in the road!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s eyes swept around.</p><p>At this time, many people condensed flames, holy light, and the like. Countless bright lights, like stars in the night sky, illuminated this space.</p><p>They found that they were now in a huge stone room.</p><p>This stone room was extremely huge and was more than enough to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>Around the stone room, there were many huge passages.</p><p>There were no markings at the entrance of the passage, so no one knew where these passages led to.</p><p>“Heaven seat King’s disciples, we’re going this way!”</p><p>“Disciples of the heavenly God sect, over here.”</p><p>……</p><p>In the end, the thirteen forces each chose a passage.</p><p>The people of Dragon God Valley chose the passage on the left and moved forward carefully.</p><p>The passageway was wide and spacious. It was not crowded at all even when tens of thousands of people walked together.</p><p>However, everyone was very careful. In this strange environment, no one dared to be careless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
