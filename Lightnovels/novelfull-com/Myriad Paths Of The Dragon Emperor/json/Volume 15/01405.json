With a single thought, he could overturn rivers and seas.</p><p>He was much more powerful than a Martial Emperor. They were on a completely different level.</p><p>Furthermore, the martial Saint realm was completely different from the other realms.</p><p>In the cultivation of martial arts, from the martial warrior realm to the Martial Emperor realm, there were nine major realms. Each realm was divided into Nine Heavens.</p><p>However, a martial Saint was completely different.</p><p>The martial Saint realm was further divided into three stages, which were the bright Saint stage, the great saint stage, and the absolute Saint stage!</p><p>Each realm was divided into four levels-initial, upper, peak, and perfection!</p><p>The span between each realm was extremely large.</p><p>The Three Realms were collectively called the martial sage realm. Above it was the martial sovereign realm, also known as the great sovereign realm.</p><p>It was said that the Martial Emperor realm was different from the martial Saint realm.</p><p>He just didn’t know what realm the old man in front of him was at.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the old man appeared, long Yuanchuan and the others flew up into the sky. There were twenty of them, and they all greeted the old man, ” “This subordinate pays his respects to elder Hong!”</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The tall and sturdy old man nodded and waved his hand. Long Yuanchuan and the others stood behind him respectfully.</p><p>Then, elder Hong’s gaze swept across the entire place.</p><p>Everyone felt an invisible pressure pressing down on their bodies. They immediately stood up straight and looked solemn. Even those local young men who were extremely arrogant, they still stood obediently and respectfully in the eyes of elder Hong.</p><p>I believe everyone already knows our goal this time!</p><p>Elder Hong said, his voice loud and clear, ringing in everyone’s ears.</p><p>here, I would like to emphasize a few points. First, we are entering the great Emperor’s Secret realm, and the great emperor is Emperor Cang!</p><p>Elder Hong announced.</p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p>“What? It’s actually Emperor Cang?”</p><p>I thought it was a secret realm left behind by a great emperor from a long time ago. I didn’t expect it to be Emperor Cang!</p><p>There were many discussions at the scene, and the loudest were the local young men.</p><p>Because, Emperor Cang’s reputation was too great.</p><p>Whether it was Dragon God Valley or the tianshen sect, they were all located in the Cang region. As the name suggested, the name of the Cang region came from Emperor Cang.</p><p>60,000 years ago, Emperor Cang was the ruler of the Azure continent. He was the only great emperor of the Azure continent.</p><p>However, 60,000 years ago, Emperor Cang suddenly disappeared without a trace. It was said that Emperor Cang had already fallen.</p><p>As for how he had died, no one knew.</p><p>Emperor Cang disappeared, and the Azure continent no longer had any emperors. Now, it had created a situation where heroes fought for supremacy.</p><p>And this time, the great emperor secret realm was actually Emperor Cang’s. This was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>this time, you will be entering the Emperor Cang’s Mystic realm. It is not only a test, but also a training experience. It is also your chance. When you come out of the mystic realm, you will become official disciples of Dragon God Valley. Also, you can use the treasures you have obtained in the mystic realm. If you need them, you can keep them for yourself. The sect will not force you to hand them over!</p><p>if you feel that you can’t use it, you can hand over some high-grade treasures or secret techniques to the sect. The sect will definitely compensate you with orirocks or treasures of equivalent value!</p><p>Elder Hong’s words made everyone’s hearts burn.</p><p>Dragon God Valley would not force anyone to hand over the treasures in the great emperor secret realm. It was a voluntary matter. If they were willing to hand over the treasures, they would do so. The sect would compensate them accordingly.</p><p>This condition was too generous and shocking.</p><p>What he got was his own.</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly impressed. This was also one of the strategies of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>In this way, everyone would try their best to find the treasure, because what they obtained would be their own.</p><p>If the Dragon God Valley sect had given the order to hand over all the treasures they had obtained, no one would risk their lives to search for treasures. At most, they would find a place to hide and pass the assessment when they came out.</p><p>In any case, these young men would be disciples of Dragon God Valley in the future. The more fortuitous encounters they had, the more Dragon God Valley would benefit in the future.</p><p>“The second point!”</p><p>Elder Hong’s voice rang out again, and the entire place fell silent.</p><p>secondly, this time, the thirteen top sects of the Azure continent will send a large number of disciples in. The competition will be intense. Therefore, the disciples of Dragon God Valley must unite against the outsiders. Do you understand? ”</p><p>“Yes, elder!”</p><p>Everyone responded loudly.</p><p>“Alright, then follow me!”</p><p>Elder Hong waved his hand and a battleship appeared in the sky. The moment it appeared, it grew rapidly, becoming a hundred miles long.</p><p>Everyone flew onto the warship.</p><p>Although there were more than 20000 people, it was still very spacious on the hundred-mile-long warship.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>let’s go! elder Hong shouted, and the warship broke through the sky and disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>In the yuan continent, due to the stability of the space, it was much more difficult to use a transfer array. It was not that there was no transfer array, but the price to use it was extremely high.</p><p>Therefore, they usually used external objects, such as warships of various sizes and puppets, to travel.</p><p>Elder Hong’s warship was a large one.</p><p>The battleship tore through the air at an astonishing speed. Furthermore, it only needed to be activated by rough stones to keep flying without any need to rest.</p><p>A few days later, the warship stopped above a barbaric mountain range. Everyone got out of the warship and stood in the air.</p><p>Elder Hong waved his hand and kept the battleship.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The crowd looked around and found that there was someone else besides Dragon God Valley.</p><p>People from the other sects had already arrived.</p><p>“It’s the heaven God sect!”</p><p>“And the jiuxiao sword sect!”</p><p>“There’s also the heaven seat King!”</p><p>……</p><p>The local youths could tell with a single glance which force these people belonged to.</p><p>Of the thirteen top powers of the Azure continent, five or six had already arrived.</p><p>“The heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze shifted to the East.</p><p>The tianshen sect was located in the East. It was densely packed with tens of thousands of people. The number was double that of the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The Dragon God Valley had a higher requirement for bloodline. One needed to awaken the bloodline of the true dragon or the flood Dragon. However, the cultivation of the tianshen sect was more complex, so many bloodlines could join.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s eyesight was very good. He saw a few familiar faces among the tens of thousands of people in the deity sect.</p><p>Eden, Zi Wuji, Bing Kong, and Ji hongchen.</p><p>However, she didn’t see Xie nianjun.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the people of the heavenly God sect. Many people from the heavenly God sect were also looking in their direction.</p><p>this time, the Holy maiden nianjun told us that she has enemies in Dragon God Valley and the Tianyu demonic sect. She asked us to help her deal with them!</p><p>In the Tian Shen sect, a young man with a flame mark between his eyebrows said.</p><p>“Of course, since the Holy maiden has spoken, those few ants will naturally be dealt with!”</p><p>Another young man sneered.</p><p>At the mention of the Holy maiden, their eyes could not help but reveal adoration and deep respect.</p><p>Xie nianjun, the Holy Virgin of the tianshen sect, was definitely a legendary figure.</p><p>He was just from a wild island. After entering the deity sect, he was chosen by the great elder of the deity sect and was accepted as a personal disciple. Furthermore, he revealed his outstanding talent, which shocked the entire deity sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
