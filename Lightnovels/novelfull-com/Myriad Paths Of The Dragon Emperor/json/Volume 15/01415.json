However, in the end, Lu Ming was fine, but Liu Yan himself had been killed by the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>...</p><p>“Liuyan is really unlucky to have met a monster!”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Many people nodded in agreement.</p><p>Liu Yan was just unlucky.</p><p>If Lu Ming was just an ordinary martial artist, or even if he had an innate spirit body, he would probably be killed by flowing flame in the lightning tribulation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was not one of them. He was a monster who could attract the sixth heaven’s test.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother liuyan is dead. We have to report this matter to the other senior apprentices!”</p><p>“This person can’t be left alive!”</p><p>Some of the heavenly God sect disciples at the scene conversed with each other before leaving the place.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming swung his fist and collided with the combat weapon formed by the lightning tribulation. The terrifying sound of the collision resounded through the sky.</p><p>All sorts of weapons rained down from the sky, but no matter how many Thunder weapons there were, they could not stop Lu Ming.</p><p>“Good, this kind of power is right!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>&Nbsp; he discovered that only the power of the seventh lightning tribulation could truly temper his Primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>Every time he punched out, there would be bolts of lightning around his body, helping him train his spirit body.</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar came from his body, as if a true dragon was about to awaken.</p><p>Every time he clashed with the Tribulation lightning weapon, it was a form of training for his Primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>He could feel that his Chaos Domain was transforming into a complete Chaos Domain.</p><p>The seventh lightning punishment lasted for a long time, at least half an hour.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s embryonic chaos realm contracted and retracted back into the spiritual God.</p><p>But immediately after, it spread out again.</p><p>However, this time, the chaos Domain was no longer in its embryonic form, but a complete Chaos Domain.</p><p>The primal Chaos Domain had finally broken through under the tempering of the sixth lightning tribulation, becoming a complete Primal Chaos Domain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The complete Chaos Domain covered Lu Ming’s entire body. Lu Ming threw a punch, and a blurry light of chaos burst out. The Thunder tribulation weapons exploded with a bang.</p><p>“What a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The complete Chaos Domain was too powerful. It was much, much stronger than the embryonic form of the chaos Domain.</p><p>At the same time, the other lightning tribulation warriors in the Sky also scattered and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Have you transcended the heavenly Tribulation?”</p><p>Many people had the same question in their minds.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, the Tribulation clouds in the sky started to become smaller and started to gather towards the center.</p><p>it seems that he has passed the Thunder tribulation. This person is amazing. He has actually passed the sixth round of Thunder tribulation!</p><p>it’s indeed amazing and terrifying. However, he’s only at Lv 1 martial Royal realm now. He’s far from those real heaven’s pride experts. Unless he can grow up, it’s useless no matter how strong he is if he dies halfway!</p><p>The surrounding spectators began to discuss, thinking that Lu Ming had finally passed the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not think so.</p><p>He looked at the sky, his eyes shining.</p><p>This was because he felt a powerful pressure that was several times stronger than the sixth heaven test.</p><p>“There’s more!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>The Tribulation clouds within a radius of several hundred miles continued to gather, and finally turned into a tribulation cloud with a radius of only thirty miles.</p><p>Crackling …</p><p>In the Tribulation cloud, lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled, shaking the sky.</p><p>At this time, those surrounding spectators also discovered that the situation was not right.</p><p>“What’s going on? The Tribulation clouds didn’t dissipate, but instead gathered together!”</p><p>“That kind of fluctuation makes one’s heart palpitate!”</p><p>it can’t be. There’s also the seventh heaven’s test? ”</p><p>When those people guessed the final answer, they were all stunned.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation was not over yet. There was still the seventh lightning tribulation.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>In the Azure region, it had been tens of thousands of years since anyone had passed the seventh lightning tribulation.</p><p>There was a legend in the world that those who could pass the seventh Heavenly Tribulation had the potential to become a great emperor.</p><p>Although it only had the potential, it was already shocking enough.</p><p>In the vast Azure continent, ever since Emperor Cang disappeared, no other great emperor was born.</p><p>Each great emperor was a legend in the world. They ruled an area and moved unhindered across the world.</p><p>This kind of person’s lifespan was unknown, and he almost lived forever.</p><p>The ultimate goal of all cultivators was to become a great emperor.</p><p>Oh my God, there’s such a monster in Dragon God Valley. I wonder if he can survive this tribulation!</p><p>just watch. Look, the world refining tribulation Bell. It’s the world refining tribulation Bell!</p><p>it’s said that the world refining tribulation Bell only appears in the seventh lightning tribulation of the martial Royal tribulation!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were wide open as they stared ahead.</p><p>Above Lu Ming’s head, the Tribulation cloud rolled. Countless lightning bolts gathered to form a Bell.</p><p>It was a huge Bell of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The bell trembled and descended from the sky, shrouding Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could not avoid the bell of Heavenly Tribulation. He was enveloped by the world refinement tribulation Bell.</p><p>There was a terrifying energy within the bell that enveloped Lu Ming. It was a kind of refining power that could refine Lu Ming’s entire body.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged and circulated his quintessential essence. The chaos Domain covered his entire body to resist the refining force.</p><p>However, this power of refinement was extremely mysterious. Although a portion of it was blocked by the chaos Domain, a small portion of it still seeped into the chaos Domain and even into the spiritual God.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>The spiritual God was the weakest and most crucial part of the human body.</p><p>If the spiritual God was destroyed, it was equivalent to death.</p><p>The refining power surged into his spiritual God, and a tearing pain instantly came from his spiritual God.</p><p>The pain came from the soul, and it was tens or even hundreds of times stronger than the physical body.</p><p>The power of refinement could even refine the soul.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming growled and gritted his teeth.</p><p>He knew that if he couldn’t hold on any longer, his spiritual God would break apart and he would be completely refined by the world refining tribulation Bell.</p><p>Lu Ming had finally encountered a crisis since he transcended the Tribulation.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in the big bell, resisting with all his might.</p><p>Outside, there were at least a few hundred people watching.</p><p>They were curious if Lu Ming could survive the seventh lightning punishment.</p><p>the seventh lightning tribulation, the world refinement tribulation Bell. It’s extremely terrifying and can refine everything. For tens of thousands of years, there have been geniuses in the Azure continent who faced such a tribulation, but they were all refined by the world refinement tribulation Bell.</p><p>that’s right. It’s too difficult to pass the seventh heaven test!</p><p>Some people sighed.</p><p>Time passed by slowly.</p><p>One hour, two hours, three hours …</p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten hours had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was still persevering in the world refinement tribulation Bell.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s appearance was extremely terrifying. All the muscles in his body seemed to have been corroded away, leaving only a skeleton.</p><p>In fact, the power of refinement had already begun to refine the bone banner.</p><p>Inside the spiritual God, the spiritual God was dim and had no light. Lu Ming’s soul was like a candle Flame in the Wind that could be extinguished at any time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
