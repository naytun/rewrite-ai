We three Ruan brothers will never be manipulated by others!</p><p>One of the three brothers said.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>“It seems that if I don’t cripple a few people today, you’ll really think that I won’t dare to be ruthless!” Yin feizhang sneered.</p><p>After saying that, silver flying badge emitted a green light and a wisp of cold killing intent.</p><p>The three brothers gathered together and looked at the silver flying badge cautiously.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Silver flying badge made his move. A blue palm print was sent toward one of their dantian.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The triplets shouted at the same time. The auras on their bodies actually connected with each other. Their auras merged seamlessly and their auras rose sharply.</p><p>One of them threw out a punch and it collided with the palm of the silver flying badge.</p><p>With a loud explosion, silver flying badge’s body trembled and he was sent flying backward.</p><p>The triplets also took a few steps back at the same time.</p><p>“You have some skills!”</p><p>Yin feizhang’s face turned cold.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the triplets ‘auras would be able to combine and resist his domain martial skill.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Silver flying badge shouted and attacked the triplets again. However, the triplets stood together and exchanged a few moves with silver flying badge, but the result was the same.</p><p>They were evenly matched, and the silver flying badge could not defeat the triplets at all.</p><p>Many people’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The heaven’s pride experts of the yuan continent were powerful and had cultivated domain martial arts techniques.</p><p>However, there were too many of them in the continents outside of the yuan continent. There would always be some outrageous heaven’s favorites who could compete with the local heaven’s favorites.</p><p>As long as they could resist the other party, they could skip the blood oath.</p><p>After more than ten moves, silver flying badge still couldn’t take down the triplets. His face turned completely cold.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A silver hook appeared in silver flying badge’s hand. The silver hook was covered with spikes and looked extremely dangerous.</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon!</p><p>Silver flying badge finally used his Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>The triplets ‘expressions changed slightly. A shield appeared in their hands at the same time.</p><p>Three shields, three identical ones, and all of them were King spiritual weapons.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The silver hook in Yin feizhang’s hand swept toward the triplets, but one of them blocked it with a shield.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The silver hook swept against the shield, but the shield did not move at all.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The silver hook in Yin feizhang’s hand swept out like lightning, instantly sweeping out hundreds of ripples. Even the space had a slight ripple.</p><p>One must know that this was the yuan continent, where the space was extremely stable. It was extremely difficult to break open the space. To be able to cause a ripple in the space, one could see how terrifying the power was.</p><p>However, the silver hooks kept hitting the shields, and the triplets were as steady as Mount Tai.</p><p>In the end, even Yin feizhang’s bloodline fusion couldn’t break through the defense of the triplets.</p><p>“These three brothers are interesting!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, I’m done!”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded, which made Yin feizhang’s heart tremble. He withdrew his bloodline and turned into a human with an ugly expression.</p><p>The one who spoke was Yin Feng.</p><p>what a piece of trash! You can’t even deal with the ants of a few Savage Islands!</p><p>shut up! Yin Feng stepped forward with his hands behind his back and scolded coldly.</p><p>Yin feizhang’s expression changed drastically. He glared at the triplets and stepped aside with his head lowered, not even daring to make a sound.</p><p>“Are you going to surrender and obediently sign the blood oath contract, or do you want me to do it myself?”</p><p>Yin Feng’s gaze swept over the triplets.</p><p>the three of us will never sign a contract. We won’t be manipulated by others. At worst, we’ll just die!</p><p>One of the triplets said while the other two nodded.</p><p>“If you want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s face turned cold.</p><p>A layer of silver light emanated from his body. His muscles bulged slightly, and a silver domain spread out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Yin Feng suddenly attacked. His fist glowed with a silver light as he threw a punch at the triplets. A muffled explosion sounded in the air.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The triplets roared.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yin Feng’s Silver fist landed on the shield, causing it to shake violently. The triplets ‘faces changed and they were forced to retreat.</p><p>The three of them retreated more than a dozen steps before they could stabilize themselves.</p><p>“So strong?”</p><p>Everyone looked at Yin Feng with shock and disbelief.</p><p>The strength displayed by the silver flying badge was already strong enough. Ordinary heaven’s favorites of the same level couldn’t even take one move from the silver flying badge.</p><p>However, the triplets were able to withstand Yin feizhang’s attack.</p><p>But now, the triplets were forced back a dozen steps by Yin Feng’s punch.</p><p>“This is … Spirit body? An innate spirit body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Yin Feng’s physical body was actually a spirit body.</p><p>Yin Feng had yet to break through to the Emperor level and was only at the Supreme martial artist level. As such, his spirit body was only an innate spirit body.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of di Xian of the DI family, who also had an innate spirit body and amazing combat strength.</p><p>Moreover, once an innate spirit body entered the martial Royal realm, it could transform and become stronger and more amazing.</p><p>No wonder this Yin Feng was so arrogant. He had an innate spirit body.</p><p>not bad. To be able to take one of my punches without being defeated, it is something to be proud of for someone from a mere Savage Island to have such an achievement. But just now, I only used 50% of my strength. Let’s see how many punches you can take from me!</p><p>Yin Feng said coldly and threw another punch.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>One of the triplets roared as a true dragon appeared above their heads. The three of them used bloodline fusion and their shields expanded rapidly, covering the bodies of the true dragons.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yin Feng’s punch once again landed on the shield, causing it to shake madly. Rings of terrifying sound waves spread out, causing some people’s faces to change drastically. They were so shocked that they almost spat out blood.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The triplets backed away as their dragon claws moved on the ground, blasting huge holes in the ice.</p><p>If this was the divine Ruins ‘continent cluster, the ground within a radius of ten thousand miles would probably have exploded.</p><p>The true dragon that the triplets had transformed into trembled and almost exploded.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yin Feng’s face turned cold when he failed to take down the triplets with two consecutive punches. He felt that his dignity was being challenged.</p><p>“It should be my turn to break!”</p><p>He suddenly roared, and a pair of Silver Gloves appeared on his hands.</p><p>Without a doubt, the Silver Glove was an Emperor spiritual weapon.</p><p>With his Emperor spiritual weapon, Yin Feng punched out again.</p><p>This time, the triplets were no longer able to withstand the impact. Their shields were sent flying, and their blood vessels collapsed. They returned to their original forms and were sent flying. They crashed into the wall of the valley and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>you can be proud of yourself for being able to take three of my punches. I’ll give you a chance to sign the contract last!</p><p>Yin Feng said indifferently with his hands behind his back. He then looked at Yin feizhang and chided, ” “Continue signing!”</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>Yin feizhang bowed and walked forward with the blood oath contract in his hand. He stared at one of the men and scolded, ” “Hurry up and sign!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
