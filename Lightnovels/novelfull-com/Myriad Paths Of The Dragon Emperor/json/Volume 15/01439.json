On the market, it was a treasure that couldn’t be bought with money, and its value was immeasurable.</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>“It’s mine!”</p><p>More than a dozen young men moved at the same time and rushed toward the Jade armor.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“You’re the one who should get lost!”</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>More than a dozen people were engaged in an intense battle.</p><p>Sword Qi and saber radiance were everywhere. Everyone wanted to get the Jade armor.</p><p>For a time, no one could succeed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. At the same time, he activated the wind element technique. With a flap of his wings, his figure suddenly disappeared. In the next moment, he broke through the layers of obstacles and appeared near the Jade armor.</p><p>“It’s you?”</p><p>A young man shouted. The Holy Light surged towards Lu Ming like a tide.</p><p>The leader of the heavenly God sect, Shi Tian!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted and took a step forward. He used the nine Dragons heaven stomping steps and his Chaos Domain burst out.</p><p>The divine power on Shi Tian’s body fluctuated and trembled violently. His body trembled and he was sent flying by Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his hand and condensed a large hand, grabbing at the Jade armor.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it!”</p><p>The others were in a chaotic battle. However, when they saw Lu Ming approaching the Jade armor and was about to get it, they all attacked Lu Ming.</p><p>All at once, there were at least five to six attacks that were aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>These people were the leaders of their respective sects. Their cultivation had reached Lv 2 martial Royal realm, and their attack power was extremely terrifying. When five or six of them joined forces, it was even more terrifying.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>The black wings on Lu Ming’s back closed together and enveloped him. At the same time, the chaos Domain spread out and covered his entire body.</p><p>Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>There was a violent boom, and the chaos Domain and black wings shook violently.</p><p>However, Lu Ming managed to block it. At the same time, he grabbed the Jade armor and kept it in his storage ring.</p><p>“Hand over the treasure!”</p><p>“Otherwise, die!”</p><p>A series of cold voices rang out. There were at least six auras that were firmly locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the room. Six young men had surrounded him.</p><p>Shi Tian, he Yu, Wang Xiao, the demonic-looking youth, the green-robed youth, and a tall and sturdy youth.</p><p>The others, like Luo Xiang, stood on the side and didn’t make a move.</p><p>“With just the six of you, I’m afraid you’re still a little lacking if you want to take my life!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently.</p><p>“Also …”</p><p>Lu Ming turned his gaze to he Yu and said,”We’re from the same sect, and you’re going to attack?”</p><p>you can’t afford such a treasure. Leave it to me. I’ll report it to the sect and give you a reward!</p><p>He Yu said coldly.</p><p>“Leave it to you? Hehe, what a hypocrite. If you want it, just say it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“Hmph, then I’ll test you and see how much you’re worth!”</p><p>He Yu said coldly. His body was suffused with a blood-red light and a Dragon’s Roar could be heard. A layer of fine blood-red Dragon scales appeared on the surface of his skin.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He Yu took a step forward and pounced toward Lu Ming like a human-shaped T-Rex. His hand turned into a dragon’s claw as he tried to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>Blood Dragon combat body. I’d like to see how strong it is!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The fist and the Dragon Claw collided with a dull boom. Then, he Yu’s body trembled and he was forced to retreat.</p><p>this person is so powerful. He can actually force he Yu to retreat in a head-on battle!</p><p>&Nbsp; the gazes of the other youths around him focused.</p><p>Among them, he Yu’s close combat ability was the strongest, and no one was his match in close combat.</p><p>However, Lu Ming managed to force he Yu to retreat.</p><p>It was simply shocking.</p><p>we’d better attack together. This man is demonic and not easy to deal with!</p><p>Shi Tian said with cold killing intent.</p><p>Lu Ming was someone he had to kill.</p><p>I think so too. Let’s join forces and kill this person. He Yu, you don’t have any objections, right? ”</p><p>Wang Xiao said, his gaze turning to he Yu.</p><p>don’t worry. This person is lawless. He even dared to hurt my fellow disciples of Dragon God Valley. He is lawless and deserves to be killed!</p><p>He Yu coldly said.</p><p>hehe, so many people against one person, and you still speak so eloquently. How despicable!</p><p>A disdainful voice was heard. It was not Lu Ming but Luo Xiang.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Shi Tian and the others “eyes turned cold, but they didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Shi Tian spoke and made the first move.</p><p>Holy light surged around him and condensed into a Holy Spear, which flew toward Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, Wang Xiao’s palm released a burst of sword Qi, and an extremely sharp sword light cut through the air towards Lu Ming.</p><p>Then, the youth in the green robe and the demonic Qi attacked.</p><p>Together with he Yu, the six of them could fight both at close range and at long range. Moreover, they were all peerless geniuses, and their combat strength far exceeded ordinary emperors. Even a Lv 4 martial Royal realm expert would be killed in an instant if the six of them joined forces.</p><p>Even those at the fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm had to retreat.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted. He flapped his black wings and charged at one of them.</p><p>Lu Ming would not stand in the middle like a fool and be a live target. If he wanted to fight, he would defeat them one by one.</p><p>Lu Ming chose the green-robed young man.</p><p>Among the six of them, the green-robed young man was the least threatening to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming dodged three attacks at top speed and took two of them head-on. He rushed to the front of the young man in green. His third bloodline emerged and waves of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body, increasing his strength once again.</p><p>He stretched out his left hand and the devouring power burst out, covering the young man in green. At the same time, he threw a punch with his right hand.</p><p>The prison suppressing heavenly art combined with the chaos Domain and crushed out.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The air trembled, forming a terrifying fist force that struck toward the green-robed youth.</p><p>The poisonous gas surrounding the green-robed young man was devoured by the devouring power. Then, Lu Ming’s fist force landed with a loud bang.</p><p>The green-robed young man screamed in pain. His body was blown apart by Lu Ming’s fist force and turned into a cloud of green mist.</p><p>The next moment, the mist condensed and tried to reform its body.</p><p>The green-robed young man’s spiritual body was a medium-grade earth spiritual body, a highly toxic spiritual body. Like a fire spiritual body, it had a strong life force and could turn into poisonous gas to reduce typhoid fever.</p><p>&Nbsp; however, the youth had still suffered unimaginable damage from the primal Chaos Domain. His green mist began to twist and convulse as he tried to recover, but it was difficult to do so in such a short time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
