A ball of silver light and a sword light crisscrossed, and a Dragon’s Roar pierced through the sky.</p><p>All of a sudden, the sword light brightened. With a slash, the silver light was extinguished. Then, a figure retreated madly and appeared above everyone.</p><p>It was the master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>At this moment, a deep sword wound appeared on the master’s chest. The wound went straight to his heart, and he could even see his beating heart.</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley was suffused with silver light as his muscles wriggled. He wanted to heal the wound, but countless tiny wisps of sword Qi were destroying his muscles, making it difficult for him to heal in a short time.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley paled, and he couldn’t help but spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The crowd couldn’t help but gasp with their eyes widened.</p><p>The valley master of Silver Dragon Valley had been defeated and injured by the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley. If the sword had been a little deeper, it would have pierced through the heart of the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>The key was that the valley master of Silver Dragon Valley had been defeated in just a short while. It was obvious that there was a huge difference in their fighting strength.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master descended from the sky, his sword Qi soaring into the sky. His entire body exuded a terrifying and sharp steam engine as his dignified voice rang out. “You barged into Cloud Dragon Valley without permission. Do you think I’m easy to talk to? Yin Zheng, I’ll spare your life this time, but if there’s a next time, I’ll behead you!”</p><p>“You …”</p><p>&Nbsp; the valley master’s face was extremely ugly, but he looked at the valley master with fear and disbelief.</p><p>The others couldn’t help but swallow their saliva.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master had always given people a gentle impression. No one had expected him to have such terrifying combat strength. When he was angry, his aura was so terrifying and overbearing. He had even said that if there was a next time, he would kill the silver Dragon Valley master.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was the master of a Valley.</p><p>The point was that the master of Silver Dragon Valley didn’t dare to argue.</p><p>Everyone couldn’t help but re-examine Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley was a newly established Dragon Valley in the Dragon God Valley. It had the smallest population and had always been regarded as the weakest.</p><p>But was that really the case? The cloud Dragon Valley master was simply unfathomable!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master continued, ” if my disciple is innocent, no one can frame him. Today, I will personally search his soul and see the truth!</p><p>With that, the cloud Dragon Valley master took a step forward and appeared beside Lu Ming.</p><p>“Grandpa!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted in shock.</p><p>Yun ruoxu, don’t go too far. Don’t overdo it!</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley said.</p><p>“Laughable!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes were cold as he said, ” enough? You’ve brought people to my Cloud Dragon Valley. Even you, the valley master, have to deal with me, a new disciple. Now, you’re telling me to stop?”</p><p>&Nbsp; the master of Silver Dragon Valley had a gloomy expression and was speechless.</p><p>The others also shook their heads.</p><p>That’s right. Previously, it was Yin Feng who had led his men to attack Cloud Dragon Valley. He insisted that Lu Ming had killed his fellow disciples and wanted to take Lu Ming away. In the end, when he was no match for the master, the master of Silver Dragon Valley took the initiative to attack first. They had been the ones who kept pressing.</p><p>To put it bluntly, Cloud Dragon Valley was just a counterattack.</p><p>“Soul search!”</p><p>Yin Feng! the cloud Dragon Valley master shouted as his palm emitted a ray of light. He then extended a finger and pointed it at Yin Feng’s forehead. Yin Feng cried out as his body immediately stiffened and his eyes became unfocused.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master personally began to search his soul.</p><p>After a moment, a sharp glint flashed in the eyes of Valley master void cloud as he said, ” “Today, I’ll let the truth be revealed!”</p><p>With that, the cloud Dragon Valley master’s other hand glowed, and a translucent crystal appeared.</p><p>memory crystal!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>A memory crystal was a rare treasure. When one searched the soul, it could project the memories of the person being searched into a picture so that others could see it.</p><p>The memory crystal glowed, and an image appeared in the sky.</p><p>In a courtyard, a young man stood with his hands behind his back. It was Yin Feng himself.</p><p>&Nbsp; there were three more people in front of Yin Feng who respectfully bowed.</p><p>“That’s Xu long!”</p><p>“That’s right. The other two are Duan Yan and Fu Xing!”</p><p>Someone cried out in surprise, recognizing the person in the image.</p><p>At this moment, on the screen, Yin Feng said indifferently, ” I’ve already arranged for this mission through a few deacons of the hall of missions. All of you will work together with Lu Ming and look for an opportunity to kill him during the mission, no matter what method you use!</p><p>“Yes, young master Yingfeng, don’t worry. I’ll make sure that Lu Ming dies without anyone knowing. When the time comes, we just have to push it to the point where he died in a dangerous battle while carrying out a mission. No one will suspect anything!”</p><p>Xu long sneered, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>don’t worry, young master. They’re just Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm ants. I can kill them as easily as crushing an ant!</p><p>“This matter is definitely in the bag!”</p><p>Duan Yan and Fu Xing spoke separately and then discussed the specific details.</p><p>At this point, the master of Silver Dragon Valley looked gloomy.</p><p>As for the others, they were enlightened.</p><p>It seemed that Lu Ming was telling the truth.</p><p>It was all because Yin Feng wanted to kill him. He actually arranged for someone to kill Lu Ming during the mission. Therefore, Lu Ming retaliated and killed Xu long.</p><p>At this moment, the scene suddenly changed to another scene.</p><p>This time, it was not about Lu Ming. Yinfeng was planning something else to deal with someone else.</p><p>damn it, so my little sister was killed by Yin Feng. To think I still believed him!</p><p>A young man in the crowd suddenly shouted, his eyes red.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley glanced at the young man with cold killing intent, which made the young man’s face turn ugly. He gritted his teeth, but he didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>Yin Zheng, what a strong wind. Let’s continue watching!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master smiled faintly as the image projected by the memory crystal changed again.</p><p>It was another conspiracy of yinfeng.</p><p>After watching it, the scene changed again.</p><p>Following that, at least a dozen scenes changed. They were all about how Yin Feng harmed other Dragon God Valley disciples and even used his power to humiliate the other female disciples.</p><p>“Ah, my family, it’s all yinfeng!”</p><p>“My little sister!”</p><p>At the scene, there were a few angry roars coming from the family members of the people who had been harmed by yinfeng. In the past, no one knew about it, but now, it was all exposed.</p><p>Finally, the scene changed to a mansion.</p><p>Yin Feng was leading his men and massacring the people in the mansion.</p><p>“The Feng clan!”</p><p>Lu Ming spoke. He recognized that this was the Feng family mansion.</p><p>One by one, the Feng family members fell in front of Yin Feng.</p><p>Some of them were still old people and children. Some of them did not even cultivate martial arts, but they were all killed by Yin Feng.</p><p>In the end, not even a chicken or dog was left alive. He burned the Feng family to the ground.</p><p>“Lu Ming, this time, let’s see how you can quibble. Let’s see who can testify for you!”</p><p>Standing high above the Feng family, Yin Feng’s cold voice came out of his mouth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
