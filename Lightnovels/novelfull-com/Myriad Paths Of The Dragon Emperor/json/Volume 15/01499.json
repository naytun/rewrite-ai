The chaos Domain formed a huge palm print that pressed down on Blizzard Silver City.</p><p>...</p><p>Blizzard Silver City knelt down in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Earlier, he wanted Lu Ming to kneel down. But now, he knelt down himself.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming threw two consecutive punches. The terrifying force of the punches sent the other two youths flying and they spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>In an instant, two of the silver Dragon Valley’s fifth level martial Royal realm youths were sent flying, and the last one knelt in front of Lu Ming. He was completely vulnerable.</p><p>At the side, the others revealed shocked expressions.</p><p>Lu Ming had become stronger.</p><p>He was even stronger than when he killed Yin Feng. It was shocking.</p><p>Was this still a person from a desolate Island? It was unbelievably strong.</p><p>They finally knew why the cloud Dragon Valley master had accepted Lu Ming as his disciple. It was because the cloud Dragon Valley master had a discerning eye and recognized Lu Ming’s talent.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Ding Mao’s body was exuding a terrifying aura, and the pressure was pressing down on Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if there was a huge mountain pressing down on him.</p><p>seventh level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming was slightly shocked.</p><p>Ding Mao was a Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert, an advanced martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>Lu Ming, How dare you! You injured three disciples of the silver Dragon Valley and now you’re attacking us. You must be punished for your behavior. I’ll cripple your cultivation and hand you over to the Dragon Punishment Hall!</p><p>Ding Mao said coldly. He took a step forward, and a Dragon’s Roar came from his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, Ding Mao clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>As he reached out, Ding Mao’s palm and arm glowed with a bright silver light, and a layer of Silver Dragon scales appeared.</p><p>“Thirteen charged attacks!”</p><p>An Emperor spiritual weapon spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. The spear shook and turned into a spear ray that pierced through the air.</p><p>Ding! Ding!</p><p>Lu Ming could feel a surge of energy rushing towards his spear, bending it slightly as it struck Ding Mao’s palm.</p><p>Ten bursts of power erupted from the spear, forming an incredibly sharp Qi that was about to pierce through Ding Mao’s palm.</p><p>Ding Mao’s face changed, and he roared as a terrifying power exploded forth.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s body was sent flying by the force and he crashed heavily into the wall of a Snow Mountain at the edge, causing the snow Mountain to explode with a loud rumble.</p><p>But at the same time, Ding Mao took a step back.</p><p>seventh level martial Royal realm. As expected of a high-level martial Royal realm expert. Such powerful strength!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He felt the qi and blood in his body churning and he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“This kid …”</p><p>Ding Mao’s body was filled with killing intent.</p><p>His palm trembled slightly. The Dragon scales on his palm were shattered, revealing a trace of blood.</p><p>His palm was almost pierced by Lu Ming’s long spear.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar was heard, and the silver light on Ding Mao’s body grew brighter. It was as if a Silver Dragon was pouncing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>But right at this moment, a huge iron hammer flew over from the entrance, and with a loud boom, it flew towards Ding Mao.</p><p>Ding Mao’s face fell, and he threw Lu Ming aside as he raised his hands to meet the hammer.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>Ding Mao’s palms landed on the iron hammer, and the sound waves made many weaker cultivators retreat with pale faces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The hammer was knocked away, but Ding Mao himself was also sent flying back a hundred meters, his hands shaking.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>From the entrance, a burly figure rushed over, caught the iron hammer, and stepped forward. Every step he took caused the ground to rumble.</p><p>the silver Dragon Valley is so powerful. A Lv 7 Martial Emperor realm expert dares to attack my Junior Brother, who is only at Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm. How embarrassing!</p><p>The burly figure spoke, his voice like a great Bell.</p><p>The person was a young man with a burly figure. He was two heads taller than Lu Ming and his muscles were bulging like a wild dragon.</p><p>He was holding a huge hammer in his hand. However, this hammer was extremely special. Its handle was longer than a person, and the head of the hammer was the size of a water tank. It looked extremely shocking.</p><p>“Tian Chui, it’s you!”</p><p>Ding Mao looked at the young man coldly.</p><p>“Tian Chui, seventh senior brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>In the past ten years, the cloud Dragon Valley master had only accepted three true disciples. One was him, the other was Xue ningxin, and the last one was Tian Chui, Lu Ming’s seventh senior brother.</p><p>“That’s your Grandpa Tian Chui!”</p><p>Tian Chui grinned, then looked at Lu Ming and said,”You are my ninth Junior Brother, Lu Ming? It’s indeed powerful!”</p><p>“Thank you for your help, seventh senior brother!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>haha, you’re welcome. Let me beat up those sons of b * tches from Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>Tian Chui’s lips curled into a smile as he looked at Ding Mao with a ferocious expression,”Come, come, is the seventh level Martial Emperor very impressive? Let Grandpa Tian Chui play with you!”</p><p>“Tian Chui, if you interfere, I’ll take you down as well!”</p><p>Mao said coldly.</p><p>“Let’s see how you’re going to deal with me.”</p><p>Tian Chui’s face revealed a malevolent expression as the muscles on his entire body swelled up. He stomped heavily on the ground.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Tian Chui’s entire body was like a dragon as he charged towards Ding Mao with his giant hammer in hand.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The giant hammer seemed to smash through the void, bringing with it a terrifying storm. Its power was shocking.</p><p>A silver light erupted from Ding Mao’s body, and silver Dragon scales appeared all over his body. A pair of Silver Gloves appeared on his hands.</p><p>It was a pair of Emperor-level gloves.</p><p>“Silver Dragon battle fist!”</p><p>Ding Mao shouted as he punched out with both fists.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Ding Mao’s fist collided with the hammer, and the sky shook.</p><p>Tian Chui and Ding Mao’s bodies trembled as they both retreated. With a furious roar, they once again clashed.</p><p>“Peak of the fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm, sixth level domain. Senior brother Tian Chui, such powerful combat strength!”</p><p>Lu Ming watched from the side, secretly shocked by the combat strength of the heavenly hammer.</p><p>He was at the peak of the fifth level of the Martial Emperor realm and had a sixth level domain, but he was able to fight with Ding Mao, who was at the seventh level of the Martial Emperor realm. His combat strength was shocking.</p><p>“It seems that none of my senior brothers and sisters are simple!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Tian Chui roared, and the more he fought, the more excited he became. It was as if he had transformed into a Dragon of slaughter, and the giant hammer that was as big as a water tank poured down on Ding Mao like a storm.</p><p>Gradually, Ding Mao was actually at a disadvantage, and was being suppressed by Tian Chui.</p><p>“Tian Chui has become even stronger. The people of Cloud Dragon Valley are indeed all lunatics!”</p><p>indeed. It’s too terrifying. There’s also that Xue ningxin, and recently, Lu Ming and cloud Dragon Valley. They’re all lunatics. Their combat strength is too shocking.</p><p>I heard that none of the nine disciples of the cloud Dragon Valley master are simple!</p><p>The other members of the Dragon Valley were all discussing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Tian Chui and Ding Mao had exchanged over a hundred moves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
