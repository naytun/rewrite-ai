He had reached the peak of the LV 1 martial Royal realm.</p><p>The great emperor secret realm had only been open for a dozen days, but Yin Feng’s cultivation had already reached the peak of Lv 1 martial Royal realm. This was truly shocking.</p><p>...</p><p>However, it wasn’t hard to understand. A genius like Yin Feng, who had lived in the yuan continent since he was young, had already reached the limit of the Supreme-being realm. The reason why he hadn’t broken through to the Martial Emperor realm was because he had been suppressing it. His goal was to enter the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>They had been suppressed for too long and had accumulated too much. Once they broke through to the Emperor realm, their cultivation would advance by leaps and bounds. It was normal for them to reach the peak of the first level Martial Emperor realm in a dozen days.</p><p>In fact, it wouldn’t be long before he could break through to the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Yin Feng exploded with all his strength to fight against Lu Ming.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two fists collided, and the sound was like the ringing of a Bell.</p><p>However, the result was the same. Despite Yin Feng’s peak Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm cultivation, he was still no match for Lu Ming. He was completely suppressed by Lu Ming and was forced to retreat.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ming did not even use the chaos realm. He simply used the Dragon God combat body and the prison suppressing heavenly technique to fight.</p><p>Although Lu Ming’s astral body was of the same level as Yin Feng, a low-grade astral body, he had been tempered by the world refinement tribulation Bell. There was a trace of chaos Qi in his body, which made his astral body stronger than the average low-grade astral body.</p><p>It was close to a medium-grade earth spiritual body!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming continued to punch like an invincible God of War, completely suppressing Yin Feng.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Yin Feng’s body trembled and he kept retreating. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>At the side, the others were greatly shocked.</p><p>Yin Feng was an innate spiritual body and had even evolved into a low-grade earth spiritual body, but he was still not Lu Ming’s match. Lu Ming, this young man from the savage Island, had a combat strength that was beyond their imagination.</p><p>“What’s wrong? This is your combat power? Is this the source of your confidence? Didn’t you want me to see the difference between you and me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Yin Feng let out a beast-like roar. He was so aggrieved.</p><p>At the Supreme level, he was suppressed by Lu Ming. Even now, he was still suppressed.</p><p>“End!”</p><p>A blood-red light flashed on Lu Ming’s spine. A wisp of energy from his third Blood Meridian gushed into Lu Ming’s body. A layer of blood-red light emerged on Lu Ming’s body, and endless killing intent enveloped Yin Feng.</p><p>Yin Feng shivered as he was enveloped by the endless killing intent.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>After borrowing the power of his third bloodline, Lu Ming’s strength increased greatly. When his fist collided with Yin Feng’s fist again, a cracking sound was heard from Yin Feng’s arm. His arm was completely twisted.</p><p>arghh! Yin Feng screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lu Ming pressed his hand down and The Phantom of the prison-suppressing stele appeared on his arm, pressing down on Yin Feng.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yin Feng raised his arms and tried his best to resist. However, he was pressed down by Lu Ming’s palm and he immediately knelt down.</p><p>With a loud bang, he knelt on the ground in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Even if you want to beg for mercy, there’s no need for such a big gift, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Ah, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes were red. He roared in anger and struggled madly.</p><p>Last time, Lu Ming had stepped on his face nine times and he had become the laughingstock of Dragon God Valley. He was also ridiculed by his competitors. Now, he was kneeling in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>This was a great humiliation that he would never be able to wash away in his life.</p><p>Even if he were to rise up against the heavens and rule the world in the future, this incident would still be a stain on his life.</p><p>He was furious. He roared. He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into pieces.</p><p>However, what welcomed him was Lu Ming’s kick.</p><p>Lu Ming lifted his leg and kicked him.</p><p>The sole of his foot landed on Yin Feng’s face again. Yin Feng screamed and his body slid down the floor.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and chased after yinfeng, about to stomp on him again.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>A voice was heard from the crowd of Dragon God Valley. Then, a figure rushed out at an amazing speed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The figure instantly stretched out nine blood-red Dragon claws and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The wind from the claw howled with a mournful sound, and its power was astonishing.</p><p>Lu Ming had a feeling that if he was scratched by the Dragon Claw, he would be crushed to pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming identified the position by listening to the sound and struck out nine palms in a row. His palms were covered by the chaos Domain and collided with the nine blood-red Dragon claws.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>There were nine consecutive explosions. Lu Ming’s figure was blocked, and the figure used the force to drift back dozens of meters.</p><p>second level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart trembled slightly and he looked at the other party.</p><p>It was a very young man in his twenties. He looked even younger than Lu Ming and was very handsome. Furthermore, he had striking blood-red long hair that was tied up casually.</p><p>“He Yu!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat as he recognized this person.</p><p>There were many geniuses and experts from the thirteen top sects and forces who entered the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>This was especially so for the local talents. They had received the best training since young and had many innate spirit bodies. Their combat power was extremely strong.</p><p>However, there were still leaders among these people who suppressed the others.</p><p>The leader of Dragon God Valley was he Yu.</p><p>Lu Ming had heard people talking about this on their way to the great emperor secret realm. That was why Lu Ming recognized this person.</p><p>This person was indeed powerful. He had only entered the great emperor secret realm for a short time, but his cultivation had already broken through to Lv 2 martial Royal realm. It was truly shocking.</p><p>“Ah, he Yu, help me kill him, help me kill this bastard!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted hysterically. He was about to go crazy.</p><p>“Lu Ming, your combat strength is impressive. Let’s fight another day. Let’s go!”</p><p>To everyone’s surprise, he Yu didn’t continue fighting, but retreated instead.</p><p>“He Yu, what are you doing? Help me kill this bastard.”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>He Yu looked at Yin Feng coldly. He grabbed Yin Feng and walked into a passage. The other geniuses of Dragon God Valley looked at each other for a while before following he Yu and leaving.</p><p>After walking for a while.</p><p>“He Yu, why didn’t you kill that bastard and take the treasure?”</p><p>Yin Feng still asked.</p><p>that’s because even if I take action, I don’t have absolute confidence that I can take down this Lu Ming!</p><p>He Yu stopped and said solemnly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others from Dragon God Valley, including Yin Feng, were all stunned.</p><p>“How is that possible?” Yin Feng asked after a while. Your cultivation has already broken through to the LV 2 martial Royal realm, and your spiritual body is a medium-grade earth spiritual body. How could you not defeat that kid?”</p><p>He Yu frowned and seemed to be thinking. After a long while, he let out a long breath and said, ” “This Lu Ming gives me a very dangerous feeling. We exchanged a few moves in a hurry just now. He did not use his full strength at all. I have a feeling that if we were to fight to the death now, I might be the one who dies!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yin Feng and the others were stunned once again. They found it hard to believe.</p><p>He Yu, the unparalleled genius of Dragon God Valley, actually thought that he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>There were not many people in the younger generation of the Dragon God Valley who could cultivate a medium-grade earth spiritual body. He Yu would definitely become a top figure in the Dragon God Valley in the future. How could such a figure be no match for a young man from a deserted island?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
