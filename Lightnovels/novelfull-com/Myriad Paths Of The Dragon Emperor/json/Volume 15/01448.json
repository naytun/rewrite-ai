His eyes were filled with ferocity and his long hair danced in the wind as he stared at the Saint from the Yu Du sect. the great emperor secret realm doesn’t prohibit killing. When you see a treasure, you’ll naturally fight for it. Your desire poison sect is skilled in using poison, and I reckon that every sect here has people who died at your hands. Should we also seek your desire poison sect for revenge? ”</p><p>if the juniors fight and die in battle, they can only blame their incompetence. You, as an elder, want to deal with a junior. Do you have any face? ”</p><p>Elder Hong’s voice was like a great Bell.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The Saint stage expert from the Yu Du sect had an ugly expression on his face.</p><p>However, it was also true that the younger generation of disciples would fight each other and die in battle. They could only be said to be incompetent.</p><p>If the elders, especially the experts of the Saint realm, interfered because of this, it would be a mess. If you killed my Junior Disciples and I killed your Junior Disciples, then these sects would never be able to develop.</p><p>Hmph, there are many heaven’s favorites in Dragon God Valley. My Yu Du sect is not bad either. Let’s wait and see!</p><p>The Yu Du sect’s Saint glared at Lu Ming coldly before he waved his sleeves and strode away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, not a single person from the desire poison sect was left.</p><p>“Damn it, he still managed to escape this time!”</p><p>In the crowd, Yin Feng gritted his teeth.</p><p>he’s lucky. There are many ways to kill him in Dragon God Valley!</p><p>He Yu coldly said.</p><p>Initially, they had wanted to use the Yu Du sect’s powerhouse to get rid of Lu Ming. They did not expect elder Hong to be so strong and protect Lu Ming, allowing him to escape. This made them feel a little indignant.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and looked at he Yu and Yin Feng coldly as if he was looking at two dead men.</p><p>These two people had tried to kill him time and time again. He must kill these two!</p><p>“Alright, let’s go back to Dragon God Valley First!” He said.</p><p>Elder Hong said. Then, he took out the warship and everyone boarded it. The warship broke through the sky and flew towards Dragon God Valley.</p><p>After a few days, they returned to Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Outside the Dragon God Valley, everyone got out of the warship. Elder Hong led them into the dragon God Valley. They flew over the outer Valley and into the big snow Mountain inside. They came to a huge Palace.</p><p>The palace seemed to be made of white jade. In front of the palace was a huge square. Lu Ming and the rest landed on the square.</p><p>When Lu Ming and the rest arrived, there were already many people gathered around the square. It was obvious that they had heard the news of their return in advance and had come to watch.</p><p>This time, they were entering the great emperor secret realm, so it naturally attracted many people because they were all very curious.</p><p>alright, you’ve passed the test of Dragon God Valley. Now, there are two things to do!</p><p>Elder Hong stood at the top and shouted.</p><p>The scene quieted down.</p><p>the first thing is to hand over the treasures and secret manuals you’ve obtained from the great emperor secret realm. Of course, these are all voluntary. If you think they’re useful to you, you can keep them. If you don’t have any use for them, you can hand them over to the sect. The sect will compensate you with raw stones or sect contribution points. You can do it!</p><p>one sect contribution point is equivalent to one hundred mid-grade raw gemstones. Sect contribution points can be exchanged for any other treasures in the sect’s Treasure Dragon Hall. As long as it’s available in Dragon God Valley, you can exchange for it!</p><p>Elder Hong announced loudly.</p><p>“Sect contribution points can be exchanged for any treasure?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up and he was somewhat tempted.</p><p>The Dragon God combat body that he cultivated was a low-grade earthly spiritual body, but it could be upgraded continuously. The treasures needed for the upgrade were related to true dragons.</p><p>The Dragon Bone, blood, and marrow of a true dragon could all enhance Lu Ming’s Dragon God combat body.</p><p>Of course, such a treasure of the true dragon could only be obtained by a true dragon who was above the Martial Emperor realm. Such a treasure was hard to come by in the outside world. However, in Dragon God Valley, all the Warriors had awakened the bloodline of the true dragon, and the bloodline of the living flood Dragon. There should be treasures of the true dragon!</p><p>As long as he had it, he could use his contribution points to exchange for it. Lu Ming had already started to think about what treasures he should hand over later.</p><p>the second thing is to join Dragon God Valley and become an official disciple. However, Dragon God Valley is divided into Seven Valleys, namely Ice Dragon Valley, Silver Dragon Valley, Blood Dragon Valley, Red Dragon Valley, purple dragon Valley, Black Dragon Valley, and cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>“Next, I will briefly talk about the characteristics of the seven great dragon valleys. You can choose from the seven great dragon valleys!”</p><p>Following that, elder Hong briefly explained the characteristics of the seven great dragon valleys.</p><p>The Ice Dragon Valley was the head of the seven Dragon valleys. The master of the Dragon God Valley was also the master of the Ice Dragon Valley. Among the seven Dragon valleys, the Ice Dragon Valley was the most powerful. Many people in the Ice Dragon Valley had awakened the Ice Dragon bloodline and cultivated the Ice Dragon combat body.</p><p>The blood Dragon Valley was bloodthirsty and good at fighting. They cultivated the blood Dragon combat body.</p><p>……</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley was the weakest among the seven Dragon valleys. It also had the least number of people. The entire Cloud Dragon Valley only had about a hundred people. There were no rules on which dragon body to cultivate. Any dragon body could join the cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Cloud Dragon Valley had a special characteristic-it was free. It was as free as the clouds.</p><p>freedom, like the rolling clouds, Cloud Dragon Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He found it interesting.</p><p>alright, let’s start handing over the treasures!</p><p>Elder Hong announced loudly.</p><p>There was a huge counter at the top of the square, and a few white-haired old men were in charge of inspecting the treasures and recording their information.</p><p>On the side, many people looked on curiously to see what kind of treasures they would get in the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>“I’ll go first!”</p><p>A brawny young man walked up and took out a few spiritual herbs and a spiritual weapon. That spiritual weapon was an Emperor’s spiritual weapon.</p><p>“Hmm, not bad. An Emperor spiritual weapon is worth a million medium grade raw gemstones or ten thousand sect contribution points. Do you need sect contribution points or raw gemstones?”</p><p>A white-haired old man asked.</p><p>“I need sect contribution points!”</p><p>The robust young man said.</p><p>alright, I’ll register you first. When you join a Dragon Valley, I’ll give you an identity token and give it to you!</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>The burly young man nodded and registered his information.</p><p>“Alright, next!”</p><p>The white-haired old man said.</p><p>Following that, another young man stepped forward and handed over treasures he didn’t need.</p><p>Of course, some had more people, some had less, and there were all kinds of people.</p><p>No matter if it was spirit herbs, blacksmithing materials, cultivation technique manuals, spirit weapons, or combat weapons, they could all be handed over. A few white-haired elders would appraise the price and compensate accordingly.</p><p>Soon, over a thousand people had submitted their Saint weapons, but none of them had taken out any.</p><p>After all, holy weapons were extremely precious and rare.</p><p>Even in the great emperor secret realm, not many people had obtained it.</p><p>Moreover, even if they obtained it, most people would not be willing to take it out.</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and stepped forward to the counter.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a pile of spirit weapons appeared on the counter with a clang, emitting all kinds of treasure light.</p><p>“Emperor spiritual weapons, they’re all Emperor spiritual weapons. Why are there so many of them?”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
