He opened his eyes and casually glanced at the silver Blizzard city that had already appeared under the floating platform. The corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile. Then, he began to refine the heavenly Dao imprint.</p><p>A few hours later, the heavenly Dao mark was refined. Lu Ming stood up and stepped onto the sixth floating platform.</p><p>Below the floating platform, Blizzard Silver city’s face was extremely gloomy.</p><p>“Even if Lu Ming is lucky enough to step onto the sixth floating platform, what can he do? The senior from the blizzard Silver City killed sixty-eight beasts. Lu Ming definitely can’t kill sixty-eight of them!”</p><p>It was the young man again, who gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>Blizzard Silver city’s face was cold and he did not say a word. He only stared at Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged on the sixth floating platform. He could not wait for Lu Ming to be blown off the floating platform.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was disappointed. Lu Ming’s figure did not move.</p><p>On the sixth floating platform in the heaven path battlefield, Lu Ming was fighting with all his might.</p><p>The beasts of the heavenly path here were even more powerful. Each of them was equivalent to a level-six domain expert, while Lu Ming was only level three. There was a difference of three whole levels.</p><p>Moreover, there were 108 mutated beasts surrounding Lu Ming. The pressure on him was really increasing.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long spear swept across and landed on a mutated beast. The beast was only sent flying, but it was not seriously injured. It roared, got up, and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain spear stabbed into a heavenly way strange beast. It was stuck halfway through.</p><p>a level six alien beast is indeed very strong!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes revealed a trace of surprise.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and charged at the beast like a bolt of lightning. His leg wrapped in the chaos Domain stomped heavily on the beast’s head.</p><p>Lu Ming stomped the beast down and thrust the spear down, piercing through the beast’s body. The spear trembled and the Beast collapsed.</p><p>The first level six alien beast was killed.</p><p>Roar! Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Their roars were like thunder, and more mutated beasts pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The chaos realm’s spear swept through the Army and sent a group of exotic beasts flying. Then, it stared at one of the exotic beasts and killed it with the same method as before.</p><p>this way of killing is too slow. Even though I should be able to clear the sixth floating platform eventually, it will take a long time!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>He was thinking of ways to strengthen the power of the chaos realm.</p><p>Weapons couldn’t be brought in here, and there was no true Yuan. Many battle techniques couldn’t be used here, so one could only use the power of territory.</p><p>“Wait, thirteen charged strikes!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming had an idea.</p><p>Although the [ thirteen storing power strikes ] was a domain martial technique, the domain of spear, it was more about the technique of exerting force.</p><p>The spear technique and the spear domain technique could release two, five, or even ten bursts of power at the same time, greatly increasing the power.</p><p>Then, could he use this technique in the chaos Domain?</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He did as he thought.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s spear shook and hit a beast of the heavenly path, sending it flying.</p><p>“Wrong, wrong!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The attack just now did not have much explosive power.</p><p>the primal Chaos Domain is different from the spear domain after all. However, the primal Chaos Domain contains the spear domain. It’ll definitely work. Let’s try again!</p><p>Lu Ming kept pondering in his heart. The long spear in his hand did not stop and he kept blasting out.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The chaos domain’s spear continued to bombard the beasts, sending them flying.</p><p>Lu Ming was constantly experimenting.</p><p>Time passed quickly. Soon, two hours had gone by, but Lu Ming was still fighting the heavenly way strange beast.</p><p>Below the floating platform, a group of people were waiting, incomparably astonished.</p><p>“What’s going on? Lu Ming is on the sixth floating platform, and there’s no golden light on his body. He should still be fighting the strange beasts on the heavenly Dao battlefield. Why is it still not over after more than two hours?”</p><p>that’s right, what’s going on? if he had failed, he would have been blasted down!</p><p>it’s very likely that he’s struggling to hold on. He bet 500000 contribution points with the silver Blizzard Silver City and doesn’t want to lose, so he’s gritting his teeth and holding on, trying to kill more Ultra Beasts!</p><p>“It should be like this!”</p><p>Many people were guessing.</p><p>Blizzard Silver city’s fists were tightly clenched. They were nervous.</p><p>This was related to his 500000 contribution points.</p><p>On the heavenly Dao battlefield, Lu Ming was still fighting with the exotic beasts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and struck a beast. A violent force exploded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The strange beast suddenly exploded and disappeared.</p><p>“I’ve succeeded!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. The shot just now was a success. In an instant, four levels of power exploded with a shocking power and defeated the beast of the heavenly way in one fell swoop.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The spear pierced out, and the fourfold force passed through the tip of the spear and stabbed into the body of the beast. The beast was immediately pierced through and killed.</p><p>fourfold strength, that’s enough!</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He swept his long spear horizontally and horizontally. As long as the exotic beast was swept, smashed, or stabbed, it would be killed in one blow.</p><p>In just a few minutes, the 108 mutated beasts were all killed by Lu Ming.</p><p>On the sixth floating platform, Lu Ming’s body suddenly emitted a golden radiance.</p><p>Lu Ming had passed the sixth floating platform.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City clenched his fists tightly, his eyes extremely gloomy.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The other members of the silver Blizzard city also let out a roar of disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was only a third-level territory master, but he could pass the sixth floating platform. This was unbelievable. There had never been such a case in the history of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>“Senior brother Blizzard Silver City, what should we do? Do I really have to give Lu Ming five hundred thousand contribution points?”</p><p>A young man asked the silver Blizzard city.</p><p>500000 contribution points? he’s dreaming!</p><p>Blizzard silver muttered through gritted teeth.</p><p>500,000 contribution points were equivalent to the price of half a holy weapon. Now, he only had slightly more than 500000 contribution points in total. How could he give them to Lu Ming?</p><p>“But …”</p><p>A young man hesitated.</p><p>“Hmph, junior brothers, did Lu Ming injure you earlier? Then I’ll have to trouble you again!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City looked at the three young men who were injured by Lu Ming’s shout and said coldly.</p><p>After saying that, three forces silently hit the bodies of the three young men. The three young men groaned and blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.</p><p>I’ve injured your internal organs, so you must maintain this injury, understand? ”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City ordered.</p><p>“Yes, yes!”</p><p>The three young men quickly nodded. Although they were angry, they did not dare to disobey.</p><p>Hmph, do you think it’s that easy to get my contribution points? ”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City looked at Lu Ming on the floating platform and sneered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
