Each of them had cultivated a domain-level martial arts technique. Their combat strength was much stronger than those of the overseas continent. However, these people were unable to fight back at all in the hands of Lu Ming. He crushed them like dried weeds.</p><p>Most of the local young people were also dumbfounded.</p><p>A small number of people had serious expressions.</p><p>“Yinfeng!”</p><p>After taking care of more than ten people, Lu Ming looked at Yin Feng.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming moved and strode toward Yin Feng.</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>A cold shout rang out.</p><p>A young man with a cold expression appeared beside Yin Feng and looked at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“Enough? Who Do You Think You Are, get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly.</p><p>The other party’s eyes darkened. you’ve dealt such a heavy blow to your fellow sect members. I don’t think there’s a need for you to stay in Dragon God Valley. Now, you have no share of this secret realm. Go back!</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s answer was even simpler this time. It was only one word.</p><p>you’re courting death. Don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you have some strength. I’ll let you know what true strength is!</p><p>The other party spoke coldly, and a Dragon’s Roar sounded from his body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Then, the young man exhaled. His voice was like a Dragon’s Roar. He bent his fingers like claws and clawed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming felt as if he had seen a real Dragon that was trying to grab him.</p><p>“Innate spirit body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. As soon as this young man attacked, Lu Ming could sense that this person was the same as Yin Feng. He also had an innate spirit body. Moreover, it was a special kind of dragon body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>When the young man made his move, a terrifying force was emitted from Lu Ming’s back.</p><p>It was Yin Feng. He actually took the opportunity to launch a sneak attack on Lu Ming.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>He did not panic at all in the face of the attacks. With a sway of his body, he dodged the claw in front of him and twisted his body to strike at Yin Feng.</p><p>Yin Feng’s expression changed. He did not expect Lu Ming to react so quickly. He wanted to retreat but it was too late.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm landed on his fist, causing him to tremble and stagger backward.</p><p>Lu Ming activated the embryonic form of the chaos Domain and cast the prison-suppressing heavenly art, attacking Yin Feng like a storm.</p><p>let’s attack together and kill this man! This man is lawless!</p><p>Yin Feng roared.</p><p>However, other than the young man from before, the others did not make a move.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, the competition was very fierce. Many local disciples were competitors with yinfeng, and they were happy to see yinfeng suffer.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming’s fist force was like a mountain as he threw a few consecutive punches. Yin Feng barely managed to block a few moves. When Lu Ming’s fist landed on his stomach, Yin Feng’s eyes almost popped out as he spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Lu Ming slapped Yin Feng’s face. The terrifying force almost blew Yin Feng’s head apart. His head rumbled and he fell to the ground.</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>The pupils of the young man who had attacked Lu Ming earlier contracted rapidly.</p><p>Yin Feng’s combat strength was similar to his but he was defeated by Lu Ming in a few moves. This shocked him and he retreated rapidly.</p><p>“Now, if you want to retreat, can you?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He activated the wind element technique and rushed towards the other party.</p><p>The result was without a doubt. After a few moves, the other party ended up like Yin Feng. He was beaten into a dead dog and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Now, someone can Scout the way!”</p><p>Lu Ming said softly. He picked up Yin Feng and the young man and walked towards the edge of the abyss.</p><p>“Little brat, what do you want to do? The elder warned us to stay united. You injured a fellow disciple, and now you’re killing one of us. You’re disobeying the elder’s orders. I’ll report this to the sect when we get out!”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>He was clearly the one who wanted to deal with Lu Ming. Previously, he had activated the inscription in the passage to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Later on, he wanted Lu Ming to be the Pathfinder but he was the one who started everything. Now, he was slandering Lu Ming for killing his fellow disciples.</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He grabbed the two of them and walked to the side of the abyss.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t …”</p><p>“I’m warning you …”</p><p>Yin Feng and the other young man were so frightened that they almost peed their pants. They roared madly and struggled with all their might. However, Lu Ming had already used his essential core to seal their cultivation. No matter how they struggled, it was of no use.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming swung his arm and threw the two people out.</p><p>They each flew towards a bridge.</p><p>Didn’t the two of them want someone to test the waters? Then let the two of them probe.</p><p>The two of them shrieked madly in the air. One of them was exhausted, and the other was miserable. It was worse than killing pigs.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The two of them flew along the bridge and landed on the other side.</p><p>After falling, the two of them were still screaming.</p><p>“You’re fine?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>The two of them were actually fine.</p><p>Wasn’t it a narrow escape? Logically speaking, there should only be one way out. How could there be two?</p><p>“Let’s try again!”</p><p>Lu Ming moved and grabbed a few of the young men he had just knocked down. While they were shouting, he threw them over the other bridges.</p><p>The few of them flew over one by one, and nothing happened.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming tried crossing the ten bridges one by one and nothing happened.</p><p>so he was just cursing to scare people. He’s completely fine!</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The young man from Dragon God Valley cursed as he rushed along the bridge. Sure enough, nothing happened.</p><p>These ten bridges were purely scary.</p><p>Lu Ming touched his nose. Why did this look like a prank?</p><p>“Damn it, damn it!”</p><p>Yin Feng and the young man with the innate spirit body roared in their hearts. They were furious.</p><p>This time, it was really embarrassing.</p><p>Just now, when the two of them were faced with the threat of death, they had cried out in pain. They were in such a sorry state that they would not be able to raise their heads in the future.</p><p>They blamed Lu Ming for everything.</p><p>Seeing that Lu Ming had stepped onto the bridge, the two of them were shocked. They hurriedly rushed toward the passage in front and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“These guys are lucky!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>He was indeed lucky to not die even after this.</p><p>Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying and the rest crossed the bridge and continued to move forward.</p><p>This time, not long after they walked, they saw a large door. They walked out of the door and came to a huge platform.</p><p>“People from other forces!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the area and realized that the platform was huge and long. There were also many doors on both sides of Lu Ming and the others. Disciples from other forces had appeared.</p><p>It turned out that there were many passages in the tomb that led to this place.</p><p>In front of the platform, there was a huge bubble-like object that was floating.</p><p>In the bubbles, the shadows of mountains and rivers could be seen.</p><p>There was actually a world inside.</p><p>is that the true secret realm of the great emperor? ”</p><p>it must be. This is a plane. It’s normal for a great Emperor’s Secret realm to be in a plane!</p><p>“Let’s go, charge in!”</p><p>Some people flew up and rushed toward the bubble.</p><p>The earlier he entered, the earlier he could break through to the martial Royal realm and take the initiative.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
