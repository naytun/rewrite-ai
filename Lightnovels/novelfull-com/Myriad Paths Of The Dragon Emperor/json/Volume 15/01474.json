Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure flickered rapidly and dodged the blade gleams. Then, he charged at the Golden feather at top speed.</p><p>...</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Jin Yu’s eyes were filled with cold killing intent. The demonic feather territory spread out, and in the territory, there were rays of saber radiance that slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Seal!”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly spat out a word.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Five light doors suddenly appeared above Jin Yu’s head.</p><p>The five gates of sealing shone with a brilliant light and pressed down on the Golden feather.</p><p>At this moment, Jin Yu’s movements froze. He was enveloped by the sealing power of the gate of sealing and was greatly affected.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>die! Jin Yu shouted in anger. Five rays of blade light shot out and hit the five gates of sealing. The five gates of sealing started to shake violently.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Then, the five gates of sealing exploded.</p><p>However, the seal at this moment was enough for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Godly sword technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming appeared not far away from the Golden feather. Two beams of black light shot out from his eyes like two divine swords, piercing toward the Golden feather.</p><p>This was a soul attack technique. Jin Yu’s domain was unable to block it at all. The black divine sword directly pierced through the domain at an astonishing speed and entered Jin Yu’s body, directly breaking through Jin Yu’s spiritual God.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, Jin Yu felt a tearing pain in his soul. His spiritual God trembled and his aura weakened.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming used all his strength. His third bloodline appeared and a wisp of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body. Then, he threw a punch.</p><p>Other than the chaos sky-turning seal, this punch was Lu Ming’s strongest attack.</p><p>He threw a punch, which directly penetrated Jin Yu’s domain and went straight for him.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Jin Yu roared angrily. He endured the pain in his soul and exploded.</p><p>However, how much power could he unleash in such a hurry?</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The force of Lu Ming’s fist was as destructive as a dead branch, crushing the power of the Golden feather.</p><p>Jin Yu’s body trembled and he spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying like a cannonball by Lu Ming’s attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming stomped heavily in the air. His figure was like lightning, catching up to the Golden feather and throwing another punch.</p><p>Jin Yu let out a blood-curdling screech as his entire body was blasted towards the ground, heavily smashing onto a towering Devil Mountain. Debris flew everywhere as Jin Yu’s entire body sank into the devil Mountain.</p><p>“How did this happen?”</p><p>The other disciples of the sky demon sect were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Just now, Jin Yu clearly had the upper hand. How did he get defeated by Lu Ming in the blink of an eye?</p><p>Some people did not even see how Jin Yu was defeated.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had suddenly retaliated by casting the nine seals of the divine Gate and bombarding Jin Yu’s soul with the divine sword technique, causing Jin Yu to reveal an opening. Then, he exploded with all his strength and severely injured Jin Yu in one fell swoop.</p><p>All of this had happened too quickly, in the time it took for a spark to fly off a piece of Flint.</p><p>“Brat, what kind of despicable means did you use to injure senior brother Jin Yu?”</p><p>that’s right, he must have used some despicable means. Otherwise, senior brother Jin Yu clearly had the upper hand. How could he lose so quickly? you’re shameless!</p><p>The few young men glared at Lu Ming and berated him.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Xie nianqing stepped forward and glared at the disciples of the Tianyu demonic sect. as a disciple of the Tian Yu demon sect, you were defeated by someone who was two levels higher than you. Instead of reflecting on your own shortcomings, you only know how to slander others. Don’t you feel ashamed? ”</p><p>“But he just …”</p><p>One of the young men wanted to retort.</p><p>“What just now? In the battle just now, anyone with a discerning eye could see that Jin Yu had used his King spiritual weapon, while Lu Ming had been unarmed the entire time. He had not even used his King spiritual weapon. The only reason he had won was his true combat strength. How could he have used any despicable means? If it was really a despicable trick, there are so many people here, including my senior brother who is a high-level Martial Emperor. How could I have hidden it?”</p><p>Xie nianqing scolded again.</p><p>In the crowd, there were some youths with unfathomable cultivation. At this moment, their expressions were somewhat unsightly.</p><p>They knew that Xie nianqing was right. Lu Ming had won because of the secret skill and his own combat strength.</p><p>The young men’s faces turned red, and they didn’t dare to say anything.</p><p>who else wants to fight? anyone at or below the fourth level martial Royal realm can come and fight!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>At the scene, the disciples of the sky demon sect had extremely gloomy expressions.</p><p>Who could still fight?</p><p>Even Jin Yu was defeated. Jin Yu was an invincible figure at the LV 4 Martial Emperor realm. Not many people could defeat him. If he was defeated, others would only be humiliating themselves.</p><p>The crowd looked at each other, but no one stepped forward.</p><p>“I was wondering how strong the fighting power of the disciples of the major sects in the yuanlu continent was. But in the end, you can’t even beat me, a man from a Savage Island. How disappointing!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Ah, damn it!”</p><p>Many of the young men from the sky demon sect clenched their fists and gritted their teeth. Lu Ming’s words were like a slap to their faces.</p><p>Previously, they had called Lu Ming an ant from the savage Island. How could he be compared to them?</p><p>One by one, they belittled Lu Ming and placed themselves in a high position, saying that Lu Ming was not worthy of Xie nianqing. Only geniuses like them were worthy of Xie nianqing.</p><p>But now?</p><p>They had sent out a Paragon whose cultivation level was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s, but they were still no match for him. If Lu Ming was an ant and a piece of trash from the savage Island, what were they then?</p><p>All of their faces were burning, as if there was a flame burning.</p><p>I almost forgot. I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first!</p><p>A young man suddenly spoke and turned to leave.</p><p>“Ah, I also have something to do!”</p><p>“Me too, my master is looking for me!”</p><p>Following which, the young men randomly found someone to deal with and quickly left. They really had no face to stay here.</p><p>Especially in front of Xie nianqing.</p><p>brat, there are stronger heaven’s favorites in the Tianyu demonic sect. They’re just training outside. Let’s fight again next time!</p><p>A few young men who were the most unwilling to give up also left after leaving these words. Even Jin Yu was carried away.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, not a single person was left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry!”</p><p>Xie nianqing went forward and held Lu Ming’s hand.</p><p>“Don’t be embarrassed. You’re my woman. These toads want to eat swan meat. I’ll beat them up one by one!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>Xie nianqing’s little face blushed slightly, and he smiled happily.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, the space nearby suddenly rippled, and a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>It was a beautiful middle-aged woman in a black demonic robe. She also had an indescribable aura.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Xie nianqing exclaimed in shock when he saw the middle-aged beauty.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. This beautiful middle-aged woman was actually Xie nianqing’s master, the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
