They didn’t dare to fly in the sky, so they could only run on the ground.</p><p>The ground here was extremely strange. It was full of potholes, as if it had been corroded by something. It was extremely strange. Those black ancient trees were rooted in this kind of ground.</p><p>...</p><p>Behind them, the remaining four seventh level martial Royal realm experts were shuttling through the forest at an astonishing speed, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming could only escape.</p><p>With his current combat strength, even if he were to face a seventh level martial Royal realm expert, he would not have any chance of winning. He might even be killed, let alone four of them.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a scream from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming instinctively looked over and saw a seventh level martial Royal realm expert stepping on a pile of black mud. The mud immediately emitted a black gas. The expert was hit by the black gas and let out a shrill scream. Then, under the shocked gazes of the others, he was directly corroded and turned into a pile of mud.</p><p>“Nest, what the hell is this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming screamed in his heart and cold sweat seeped out of his face.</p><p>A Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert had just stepped on a piece of black mud and died.</p><p>Just now, Lu Ming had also passed by that piece of mud. Fortunately, he did not step on it.</p><p>This place was filled with danger at every step.</p><p>The remaining three seventh-level martial emperors looked terrified, but they still chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>these people … Something’s wrong. Why are they so desperate? why are they chasing after me so reluctantly? ”</p><p>Lu Ming had a flash of doubt.</p><p>If mo he was just jealous of Xie nianqing and wanted to get rid of him, he didn’t have to risk his life like this. He should have stopped in such a dangerous place.</p><p>Could it be that he was ordered by some Big Shot in the Tian Yu demon sect to chase after them?</p><p>Many thoughts emerged in Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>Not long after, they had covered a distance of more than a thousand miles. In front of them, the terrain had become even more complicated. There were many mountain peaks and ravines.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>All of a sudden, a violent rumble came from a huge Canyon.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming saw a herd of majestic black bulls charging out of the canyon and charging at them.</p><p>These black bulls were muscular, and most of them were three meters tall and more than five meters long. Their bodies were completely black as if they were made of iron, and their eyes were blood red, similar to the giant Eagle from before.</p><p>Some of them were even bigger, four meters tall, and some even five meters tall.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>As soon as the black bulls appeared, they roared and spread out, charging toward Lu Ming and the others.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A three-meter-tall black Bull appeared on Lu Ming’s right. Its two horns were like two blades as it charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body swayed and he dodged the Black Bull’s charge. He then threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This punch landed on the Black Bull and sent it flying.</p><p>The Black Bull was equivalent to a first level Martial Emperor. It could not stop Lu Ming at all and was sent flying hundreds of meters away by Lu Ming’s punch, crashing into the wall of a mountain.</p><p>Crushed stones flew everywhere. Then, the Black Bull shook its head and stood up again.</p><p>“It’s so hard?”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>Although he had not used his full strength in that punch, an ordinary Lv 1 martial Royal realm expert would have exploded and died if they were hit. However, the Black Bull seemed to be fine.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>After Lu Ming blasted one away, two more black bulls charged at him.</p><p>The strength of the two black bulls was even more shocking. They had reached the second level of the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming threw two consecutive punches, sending the two black bulls flying. However, just like the previous one, it only shook its head and stood up as if nothing had happened.</p><p>His bones were as strong as steel.</p><p>Furthermore, more black bulls kept charging out of the valley. At a glance, there were at least a thousand of them, but they still didn’t stop.</p><p>Among these black bulls, the weakest one was at the LV 1 Martial Emperor realm. The stronger ones were at the LV 2 and Lv 3 Martial Emperor realm …</p><p>Lu Ming even saw a sixth level Martial Emperor.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Black Bull leaped and stomped on the ground, causing the earth to rumble as if an earthquake had occurred.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The three experts of the sky demon sect were also fighting the Black Bull.</p><p>A black blade light exploded, and a large group of black bulls was sent flying. Some of the weakest Bulls ‘defenses were finally broken, and they were cut in two, bleeding black blood.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>The black bulls seemed to have been provoked by the blood and became even more furious. Most of them rushed toward the three powerhouses of the sky demon sect, many of whom were at the LV 6 martial Royal realm.</p><p>The three powerhouses from the Tian Yu demonic sect killed their way through. The three of them worked together and slowly approached Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming was also surrounded by a group of black bulls. The strongest one was at the fifth level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the head of the black Ox. His body trembled and he took a few steps back. He felt his fist go numb.</p><p>What astonishing strength!</p><p>Every single one of these black bulls had astonishing strength.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast the wind elemental technique and tapped on the head of a Black Bull, then he charged forward.</p><p>However, the black bulls did not give up and continued to pursue Lu Ming.</p><p>Some of the black bulls even shot out beams of black light from their horns at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming spread his black wings and shielded his back from the black light.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, an earth-shattering bull’s roar came from a Canyon. Then, the earth trembled as a giant bull with an astonishing physique charged out.</p><p>This Black Bull was at least ten meters tall and more than ten meters long. It was like a small hill, and it emitted an astonishing aura.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Black Bull charged at the three sky demon sect experts.</p><p>The three experts from the sky demon sect were powerful and full of demonic energy. Naturally, they were more attractive than Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The huge black Bull stomped on the ground with its four limbs and instantly crossed a distance of a few thousand meters. Like a small mountain, it charged towards one of the people.</p><p>Not good!</p><p>The man’s expression changed drastically as he slashed at the Black Bull with a demonic blade.</p><p>However, the huge black Bull didn’t seem to see it and directly rammed into it. The demonic blade collapsed and the huge bull crashed into the expert of the sky demon sect. The expert screamed and was sent flying. He broke dozens of black ancient trees and stopped breathing.</p><p>He was knocked to death.</p><p>The strength of this Black Bull was shocking.</p><p>The other two fled in all directions in fear.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The giant black Bull roared, and its horns glowed. Two black beams of light flew out like two demonic blades, slashing at the two sky demon sect experts.</p><p>The two of them blocked with their demonic blades, but they both grunted as their bodies were sent flying. Blood spurted out of their mouths and they were drowned by the countless black bulls. Only a few flashes of blade light could be seen, and then they became weaker and weaker.</p><p>At this moment, the giant black bull’s gaze turned to Lu Ming. Then, it roared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Nest!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted angrily and quickly got bubbles to open a space-time Tunnel, rushing forward for thousands of miles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
