They split open the ground and threw large amounts of rocks and soil into the distance.</p><p>Soon, a huge Palace revealed its true appearance in front of everyone.</p><p>Rather than a Palace, it was more like a fortress.</p><p>This fortress was extremely huge and Grand. It could be seen that the people living in this fortress were also extraordinary.</p><p>“Could it be the great emperor’s palace?”</p><p>Some people guessed.</p><p>In front of the fortress, there was a stone door that was tightly closed.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Someone slashed out a sword light at the wall of the fortress, but the fortress didn’t move at all. Not even a mark was left.</p><p>It seemed that the only way to enter the fortress was through the gate.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Someone sent out a palm print and hit the door from a distance. The door shook violently, but it did not open.</p><p>“Everyone, let’s work together to break this door!”</p><p>Someone suggested, and everyone nodded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Instantly, beams of light flew out from the crowd and headed for the gate of the fortress.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The door shook violently and began to shake.</p><p>“It’s effective, continue!”</p><p>“Bombard!”</p><p>More rainbow lights and all sorts of attacks were launched at the door.</p><p>The door shook even more violently.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>Finally, the door creaked and slowly opened.</p><p>A moment later, the door was completely opened. Behind the door was a dark area.</p><p>At this moment, many people stopped and looked around.</p><p>Now that the door had been opened, the people who had been working together just now would immediately become enemies and competitors, because everyone wanted the treasure.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming did not know why but he suddenly felt his heart palpitate. He had a feeling that a great disaster was imminent.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!”</p><p>At this moment, a terrifying sound rang out from within the fortress. A wave of fluctuations that made one’s heart palpitate was emitted from the gate.</p><p>Some of the young men standing in front didn’t even have time to react before their bodies exploded.</p><p>“Not good, retreat!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He pulled Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao and retreated frantically.</p><p>“Kill! Kill! Kill!”</p><p>In the fortress, the roars were endless and contained endless killing intent. There was a strong sense of unwillingness in the voice.</p><p>An invisible wave swept out from the door.</p><p>One by one, the bodies of the young men exploded into pieces.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>The rest of the people were scared out of their wits and frantically fled.</p><p>However, the invisible fluctuation was spreading rapidly.</p><p>One by one, the young men screamed miserably as they were crushed into pieces.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A wave of fluctuation spread towards Lu Ming, making his heart palpitate.</p><p>“Block it!”</p><p>Lu Ming set up a Chaos Domain in front of him, enveloping Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao. At the same time, his glabella glowed and a lightning cauldron appeared in front of him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The lightning cauldron was the first to be hit by an invisible force. It trembled violently and was sent flying.</p><p>Then, the chaos realm shook violently as well. A terrifying force passed through the chaos realm and acted on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s body trembled and blood trickled down the corner of his mouth.</p><p>On the side, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao both spat out mouthfuls of blood, their faces pale.</p><p>However, with the help of this force, Lu Ming retreated thousands of miles with the Qiu siblings and finally avoided the invisible attack.</p><p>It could be seen how terrifying these fluctuations were.</p><p>First, it sent the lightning cauldron flying. Then, it passed through the chaos Domain and injured Lu Ming.</p><p>The others were in a worse state. There had been thousands of them, but almost all of them had died from that attack.</p><p>Only a few people had managed to survive by relying on powerful secret techniques and powerful artifacts. They all looked at the fortress with fear.</p><p>That fortress was simply a fortress that demanded death.</p><p>Could it be that a Supreme expert was living inside? What was that loud roar just now?</p><p>After a few roars, the roar stopped and did not continue.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest stood in the distance, sizing up the fortress with fear on their faces.</p><p>This fortress was too strange.</p><p>Just like that, they waited for a moment, but now, the fortress was completely silent, without any movement.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a jade talisman suddenly appeared on Qiu Ying Ying’s body. This jade talisman gave off a slight vibration, and then a light barrier enveloped Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying was shocked.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the next moment, the Jade talisman carried Qiu Ying Ying and flew towards the fortress in front of them. They flew through the gate of the fortress and disappeared. Their speed was astonishing.</p><p>“Yingying!”</p><p>Qiu Hao’s face turned pale with shock as he hurriedly chased after her and disappeared from the main entrance.</p><p>There was no other abnormality.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming was a little confused.</p><p>Why did a jade talisman suddenly fly out of Qiu Ying Ying’s body and bring her into the fortress?</p><p>Everything changed so quickly that Lu Ming could not react in time.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming gritted his teeth. The lightning cauldron floated above his head and he enveloped his body with the chaos Domain. He flew toward the gate of the fortress. There was nothing unusual all the way to the gate.</p><p>Lu Ming did not stop. He flew directly into the door.</p><p>Some people in the outside world were bewildered when they saw this.</p><p>“What’s going on? Those few people who flew in were fine!”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s fine now.”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>However, no one dared to enter.</p><p>After a long time, someone finally gritted his teeth and flew towards the gate. He flew into the gate and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Seeing this, more people flew in.</p><p>Furthermore, there were still people flying over from the distance.</p><p>The inside of the fortress was very wide and huge.</p><p>After Lu Ming flew through the door, a long passageway appeared in front of him. After flying past the passageway, he saw some forked corridors and passageways.</p><p>“Where did Yingying and the others fly to?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. He then randomly chose a passage and walked forward.</p><p>There were stone houses on both sides of the passage.</p><p>Lu Zhou walked into the first stone house but found nothing.</p><p>When he entered the second stone house, he finally made a discovery.</p><p>A skeleton. Lu Ming had discovered a skeleton.</p><p>The skeleton was as white as Jade, and it sat cross-legged on the bed. It gave off the feeling that it had suddenly died while cultivating.</p><p>Lu Ming deduced that he should be an Emperor.</p><p>However, after searching for a while, Lu Ming realized that the person’s storage ring was also missing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
