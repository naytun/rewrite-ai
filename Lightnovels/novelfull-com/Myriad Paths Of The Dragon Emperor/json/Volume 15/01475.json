He was someone who could shake the entire Azure continent with a single stomp of his foot.</p><p>He was as famous as the Dragon God Valley master.</p><p>...</p><p>“Senior, I’m lu Ming!” Lu Ming stepped forward and cupped his fists.</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect smiled faintly and said, ” kid, you’re quite strong. You’ve actually cultivated a Chaos Domain. That’s even rarer!</p><p>“Many thanks for senior’s praise!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect nodded and looked at Xie nianqing with a doting expression. “I won’t object to young people falling in love and dating each other …”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect suddenly changed his tone and said, ” however, you are still at the golden age for cultivation. You should prioritize cultivation. Although your talent is not bad, your cultivation is too low. In the vast Yuan continent, it is nothing. Without cultivation, you can’t truly have freedom. Little guy, do you understand? ”</p><p>“I understand!” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>also, nianqing has a heaven-defying appearance and an innate demonic body. But because of this, there are many people who covet her. With your current cultivation, you’re too weak. Can you protect nianqing? ”</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect continued.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly. The sect master of the sky demon sect’s meaning was clear. His cultivation level was too weak.</p><p>“Master, I’ve been through life and death with Lu Ming all this while. I believe in him. He’ll definitely rise to power and won’t let anyone hurt me …”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>silly child, you are too naive. How can the divine wilderness continent be compared to the yuan continent!</p><p>The sect master of the sky demon sect said.</p><p>“But, master …”</p><p>Xie nianqing wanted to continue.</p><p>“Nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming interrupted Xie nianqing and said, ” nianqing, senior is right. The yuan continent is countless times bigger than the divine wilderness continent. In the yuan continent, my cultivation is indeed too low and I can’t give you much assurance. However, I will definitely work hard to cultivate. When I rise to the top in the future, I will truly be free and unfettered in the world!</p><p>so, nianqing, you should cultivate in the Tian Yu demon sect. One day, I will accompany you to conquer the world!</p><p>This was Lu Ming’s true feeling. Ever since he came to the yuan continent, he understood how small he was.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, a Martial Emperor was high and mighty, an Overlord of a region. But in the yuan continent, they were the most common existence. They could even be said to be ants.</p><p>In the yuan continent, true experts were as common as clouds.</p><p>Lu Ming had even seen a true great emperor. That was the real horror.</p><p>Only by stepping onto the peak of this world could one truly be free and unfettered in this world, not being controlled by others.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s spirit soared. His goal was not the Saint realm or even the great emperor realm, but the peak of the world.</p><p>An indescribable confidence exuded from Lu Ming.</p><p>“What an unruly young man. I’ll wait for you to rise to the top. Go!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect waved his hand.</p><p>“Master, I would like to give Lu Ming a paragraph!”</p><p>Xie nianqing said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>The Grandmaster of the sky demon sect nodded and took a step forward before disappearing.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xie nianqing looked at Lu Ming, a hint of reluctance in his eyes.</p><p>silly girl, I’m here to see you. I’m going to leave after I’m done. I can’t stay in the Tian Yu demon sect forever!</p><p>Lu Ming held Xie nianqing’s hand and laughed.</p><p>besides, the Tianyu demonic sect is not far from Dragon God Valley. I can come and visit you again when I have time!</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded gently. Holding Lu Ming’s hand, they walked out of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Soon, they were out of the Tianyu demonic sect. Xie nianqing was still reluctant to see Lu Ming off and wanted to send him off for a while. The two of them strolled through the air, neither too fast nor too slow.</p><p>Half a day passed just like that.</p><p>little Qing, you should go back. If you continue, you’ll have to send me to Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming said with a smile.</p><p>“Lu Ming, don’t blame master. She …”</p><p>Xie nianqing said softly. But before she could finish her sentence, Lu Ming had already kissed her on her red lips.</p><p>The two of them hugged each other tightly, as if they were going to merge together.</p><p>After more than ten minutes, the two of them separated.</p><p>you don’t have to say much. I know. Believe me, one day, I’ll definitely become Ling Yun. When that time comes, no one will be able to stop us!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then took out a black bangle and helped Xie nianqing put it on.</p><p>It was the bracelet that Lu Ming had obtained from the Emperor’s secret realm.</p><p>“A holy weapon?”</p><p>Xie nianqing murmured, his eyes slightly red.</p><p>“Silly girl, go back. I’m leaving!”</p><p>Lu Ming kissed Xie nianqing’s forehead lightly, then turned around and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll work hard to cultivate too. I’ll be with you when you’re on the top of the cloud!”</p><p>Xie nianqing turned around and walked towards the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming spread out his body and flew through the air, letting the strong wind hit his face.</p><p>“One day, I’ll definitely rule the world!”</p><p>Lu Ming roared, his voice reverberating for thousands of miles.</p><p>It would be a lie to say that he felt comfortable during the trip to the Tian Yu demonic sect.</p><p>It was fine if it was the younger generation, but in the end, even Xie nianqing’s master appeared. Although his words were not sharp, his attitude was clear. Lu Ming was too weak now and was not worthy of Xie nianqing. He should try to stay away from Xie nianqing.</p><p>This was the intention of the sect master of the sky demon sect.</p><p>Before he came to the yuan continent, Lu Ming had not expected that Xie nianqing would be chosen by the sect master of the Tian Yu demon sect as a direct disciple and even become the Holy Virgin of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>As such, there was some interference between them.</p><p>Lu Ming was angry.</p><p>However, he knew that the Grandmaster of the sky demon sect was right. His cultivation was still too weak.</p><p>Now that he was with Xie nianqing, he couldn’t be free at all. What could he do if a peak Martial Emperor coveted Xie nianqing?</p><p>Strength, everything was still strength!</p><p>He needed powerful strength!</p><p>Ever since he had formed the Dragon Alliance, dominated the divine wilderness continent, and killed Di Yi, Lu Ming had actually relaxed a little.</p><p>Although his heart to pursue martial arts had not changed, he did not feel as much pressure as before. Without pressure, he would lose the courage to move forward.</p><p>Now, he felt a strong pressure on his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming streaked across the void and moved forward at top speed. The vast land flashed past in the direction of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart tightened. He felt a strong sense of danger approaching.</p><p>Without any hesitation, black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back, surrounding him in the middle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the sky, a demonic blade seemed to cut through the entire world and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The demonic blade slashed at the black-feathered wings. Lu Ming was sent flying as if he had been hit by a mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming only managed to stabilize himself after flying for tens of thousands of meters. He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“The Tian Yu demon sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were sharp.</p><p>In the sky, six figures descended and blocked Lu Ming’s path from all directions, surrounding him in the middle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
