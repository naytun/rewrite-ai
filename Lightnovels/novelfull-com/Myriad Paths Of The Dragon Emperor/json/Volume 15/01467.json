Lu Ming shouted in a low voice. The prison-suppressing stele enlarged rapidly and pressed down on the skeletal elder.</p><p>the prison-guarding stele, it’s the prison-guarding stele. Impossible, wasn’t the prison-guarding stele broken? ”</p><p>The skeletal old man screamed hysterically as soon as he saw the prison-suppressing stele. His voice was filled with endless fear.</p><p>Then, he turned around and ran.</p><p>The skeletal old man saw the prison-suppressing stele, but he didn’t even dare to attack. He just ran away.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele shook, and the word on the stele gave off a bright light. The prison-suppressing stele became as high as the sky, and suddenly appeared above the skeletal elder’s head, pressing down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The skeletal old man screamed in horror. His body was covered with a terrible black light. At this moment, the skeletal old man’s Qi was extremely powerful. He waved his hand and a terrifying blade light slashed towards the prison-suppressing stele.</p><p>This slash was many times more powerful than the one that was aimed at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression was grave. The skeletal elder’s attack was a real desperate one.</p><p>However, the prison-suppressing stele emitted a terrifying aura that had the power to suppress everything in the world. Under its suppression, the blade light of the skeletal elder collapsed instantly.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, the prison-suppressing stele pressed down on the skeletal elder’s body. The skeletal elder screamed and his skinny body exploded into ashes.</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>That was because he did not activate the prison-guarding stele at all. It was killing the enemies automatically and its power was shocking. It was many times stronger than when Lu Ming activated it himself.</p><p>Lu Ming found it unbelievable that the prison-suppressing stele could kill its enemies on its own and burst out with shocking power.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, a ray of black light shot out from where the skeletal elder’s body had exploded. It was shockingly fast, as if it had shattered the void, and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Brat, just wait for the evil spirit cult’s revenge!”</p><p>The skeleton elder’s unpleasant voice came from afar.</p><p>“He’s not dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The skeletal elder’s body had been destroyed, but a wisp of his soul had escaped.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele trembled as if it was angry. Then, it quickly shrank and flew back to Lu Ming’s head, floating quietly.</p><p>Lu Ming sized up the prison-suppressing stele curiously.</p><p>It seemed that the prison-suppressing stele was not to be underestimated. Its origin was shocking. Lu Ming did not unleash the true function of the prison-suppressing stele. What he had unleashed was most likely just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>the prison-suppressing stele can attack the enemy by itself. This has never happened before. Strange, could it be that the other party has practiced an evil cultivation method? but I’ve met evil, demonic, and even ghost cultivators before, but none of them have shown such a strange phenomenon!</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and pondered.</p><p>He felt that it was not as simple as the other party cultivating an evil way of cultivation technique that caused the prison-suppressing stele to attack the enemy. There must be another reason, but Lu Ming did not know the reason yet.</p><p>back in the divine Ruins ‘continents, the burly man from the deity sect said that the deity sect had a fragment of the prison-suppressing stele. It should be true. I must find a way to get that fragment!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>However, the tianshen sect was extremely powerful. Some people even said that the tianshen sect’s overall strength might be the strongest among the thirteen top sects in the Cang region. It would be very difficult to get the fragment of the prison suppressing stele.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze suddenly shifted to the spot where the skeletal elder’s body was destroyed.</p><p>The skeletal elder had left almost nothing behind, and he did not have a storage ring either. However, Lu Ming found a piece of black paper floating down.</p><p>Lu Ming put away the prison-suppressing stele bloodline and appeared beside the paper in a flash. He grabbed the paper.</p><p>“A secret technique!”</p><p>Lu Ming swept his gaze across the paper and realized that it was a secret skill.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place!”</p><p>Lu Ming kept the paper. With a flap of his black wings, he tore through the void and left this place.</p><p>The battle just now had probably attracted the attention of the nearby experts.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of miles away, Lu Ming found a secret cave abode and walked in.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the cave abode, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of raw gemstones appeared. The devouring power burst out and devoured the raw gemstones ‘original Qi. He began to refine them and recover.</p><p>A few hours later, Lu Ming’s essential core had fully recovered and the circulation of his essential core was extremely smooth. It was condensed and smooth, reaching a peak.</p><p>“I’m about to break through!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face revealed a hint of joy.</p><p>When he was in Dragon God Valley, he had refined three Royal fruits. Both his realm and cultivation had reached the peak of the first level martial Royal realm, only one step away from the second level.</p><p>After this period of time and the battle with the skeletal elder, his potential had been suppressed. Now, he was finally going to break through.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm glowed and a heavenly Dao stone appeared. It then flew above Lu Ming’s head and floated above him, scattering wisps of heavenly Dao aura.</p><p>Lu Ming started cultivating quietly.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ming’s body emitted a powerful devouring force. The origin Qi between heaven and earth surged towards Lu Ming and was devoured by him.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming also took out a pile of mid-grade raw stones to aid his cultivation.</p><p>As the rough stone was continuously devoured, Lu Ming’s aura skyrocketed.</p><p>Second level Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Lu Ming had finally made another breakthrough. His Chaos Domain had been upgraded to level two, and his cultivation had also broken through to the second level of the martial Royal realm. His combat strength had improved greatly.</p><p>However, Lu Ming did not end his cultivation. He continued to stabilize his cultivation.</p><p>After three days, Lu Ming finally ended his cultivation. His cultivation at the second level of the martial Royal realm had completely stabilized.</p><p>let’s see what secret technique that skeleton old man left behind!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming took out the piece of paper left behind by the skeletal elder and started reading.</p><p>The black paper was made of an unknown material. It was very flexible and hard. It felt light in his hands. Lu Ming injected his essential core and lines of small, dense words appeared on the paper.</p><p>“Soul attack secret skill, godly sword technique!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming put down the paper, a hint of excitement in his eyes.</p><p>A soul attack technique was recorded on the paper. According to the records, one’s soul would be tempered and strengthened by practicing this secret technique. At the same time, one could use a special method to condense his soul power into a divine sword and launch an attack that could attack the soul of others.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but think of the attack of the skeletal elder. The skeletal elder’s eyes would emit a black light that attacked his soul like a divine sword. It was very powerful.</p><p>This was a priceless treasure that could not be bought in the outside world.</p><p>It could temper the soul, increase the strength of the soul, and even launch soul attacks.</p><p>This was very suitable for Lu Ming. His soul had been refined by the world refinement tribulation Bell. It was broken and then rebuilt. The strength of his soul was dozens of times stronger than that of ordinary people.</p><p>If he cultivated the godly sword technique, his soul attack would be extremely powerful.</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lu Ming began to study it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
