However, he did not discover anything after entering.</p><p>In some places, traces of fighting were found. It was clear that some people had arrived earlier and taken away the things inside the palace.</p><p>...</p><p>the great Emperor’s Secret realm naturally can’t only have the great emperor living in it. It’s said that there are many Saint realm experts under the great emperor. As for the emperors, they’re just servants!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t get the treasures left by the great emperor, he would make a big profit as long as he could get the treasures left by the Saint realm.</p><p>It was obvious that the buildings that Lu Ming had encountered were the residences of the great Emperor’s subordinates.</p><p>Not long after, Lu Ming saw a cave abode in a Valley.</p><p>At a glance, it was a cave abode where Warriors cultivated in seclusion.</p><p>Lu Ming walked toward the cave abode.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was approaching the cave abode, a ray of sword light shot out from the cave abode and went straight for Lu Ming’s throat.</p><p>The sharpness of the sword was definitely that of an Emperor.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out a finger and flicked it at the long sword. The long sword buzzed and trembled before it was sent flying.</p><p>“It’s you, Lu Ming!”</p><p>A delicate voice was heard. Lu Ming focused his eyes and was stunned.</p><p>“Young lady Qiu!”</p><p>The person who attacked Lu Ming just now was Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’m sorry. I thought it was someone else just now!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying looked at Lu Ming apologetically.</p><p>“It’s fine. Where’s your brother?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>my brother is cultivating in there. An expert left a heavenly Dao mark in this cave abode!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Heavenly Dao engraving?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That’s right, you’ll know when you come in!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and entered the cave abode with Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>The cave abode was very wide. On one of the walls of the cave abode, there was a mark that seemed to have been carved by someone with finger force.</p><p>Lu Ming took a look and was deeply attracted.</p><p>This mark was like the incarnation of the great Dao. From this mark, one could comprehend the mysteries of the great Dao.</p><p>It was very difficult for a martial monarch to improve.</p><p>First of all, he had to comprehend his domain.</p><p>Domains were divided into nine levels.</p><p>It corresponded to the ninth level of the martial Royal realm. One’s cultivation could only be improved after the territory was improved.</p><p>In order to increase his cultivation, he not only needed to refine his Zhen Yuan, but also his spirit body.</p><p>Therefore, every step forward in the Martial Emperor realm was not easy.</p><p>These great Dao marks were carved on the stone wall when experts comprehended the heavenly Dao. Later generations could comprehend the heavenly Dao according to the marks and comprehend their own domain from the heavenly Dao, thus achieving the goal of improving their domain.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming took a deep breath and calmed himself down.</p><p>Under the stone wall, a figure was sitting cross-legged, quietly comprehending.</p><p>Obviously, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao had also passed the martial Royal ordeal and reached the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Just now, Qiu Hao must have been comprehending the heaven Dao carvings here, and Qiu Ying Ying was guarding Qiu Hao. When she saw someone approaching, she attacked.</p><p>“Young lady Qiu, brother Qiu is currently in the process of comprehending. We’ll be standing guard outside the cave. I’m afraid we’ll disturb him if we stay here!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying nodded and walked out of the cave abode with Lu Ming. They waited quietly outside.</p><p>About three hours later, Qiu Hao walked out of the cave abode. He was overjoyed to see Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brother, you’ve finished comprehending?”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying asked.</p><p>yes, that heavenly Dao mark is not too profound. Furthermore, with my comprehension, I can only comprehend up to this point!</p><p>Qiu Hao nodded and sighed.</p><p>brother Lu, you’ll have to comprehend it now. I’ve already comprehended it before. Big brother and I will guard you!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said.</p><p>“Alright!” Lu Ming nodded and walked into the cave abode. He sat cross-legged under the mark and stared at it.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The mark began to change in Lu Ming’s eyes. It turned into wisps of the great Dao’s aura, which was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and verified it with his Chaos Domain.</p><p>The chaos realm was the king of all realms. It was all-encompassing, but no matter how mysterious it was, it was also a part of the great Dao of heaven and earth. It also needed to be comprehended from the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p>Gradually, Lu Ming fell into an ethereal state.</p><p>chaos is everything. It is the beginning and the end of everything …</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ming’s body emitted a layer of chaotic radiance.</p><p>The Qiu family siblings sat cross-legged outside the cave abode, protecting Lu Ming.</p><p>Suddenly, the siblings opened their eyes at the same time and looked into the distance.</p><p>Two beams of light streaked across the sky and flew towards them. Then, the light faded and two young men appeared in the sky.</p><p>there’s an ancient cave mansion here. I’m quite lucky!</p><p>A young man laughed.</p><p>The two of them descended from the sky and their eyes fell on Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>“We want this place, you guys can get lost!”</p><p>A young man waved his hand and said.</p><p>gentlemen, we found this place first. Besides, we have a friend who is cultivating inside!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained.</p><p>nonsense, so what if we found it first? with your friends, we’ll get lost together!</p><p>The young man from before berated.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>The other party was too overbearing. The moment they arrived, they immediately wanted to occupy this place and make Qiu Ying Ying and the others scram.</p><p>my friend is cultivating. We’ll leave when he’s done!</p><p>Qiu Hao said.</p><p>nonsense, we don’t have time to wait with you. If you don’t leave, then stay here forever!</p><p>The young man’s face turned cold as a domain spread out from his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In a flash, he charged towards Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao. The other young man did not make a move, but just watched from the side with a cold smile.</p><p>“Autumn water dense mist!”</p><p>“Falling flowers and flowing water!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao had no choice but to resist.</p><p>The two of them both cultivated water domains. When their domains spread out, they formed water dragons that wrapped around each other.</p><p>people from Dragon God Valley. Hmph, Dragon God Valley has been going against my tianshen sect all this time. They’re really looking for death!</p><p>The young man from before shouted coldly. With a wave of his hand, countless sharp lights slashed out, cutting the water dragons apart and then towards Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>domain martial technique!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying’s expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly released her domain. Her true Qi burst forth, and two water shields were set up in front of her.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>One after another, the sharp radiances struck the water shield, causing it to shake violently and on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The young man from before, who was also the young man from the tianshen sect, pressed his palm down again. An even stronger sharp light burst out and pressed toward the Qiu family siblings.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>This time, the water shield could no longer hold on and exploded. The siblings groaned as their bodies were sent flying. They crashed into the wall and spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>“You dare to stop me? you’re really looking for death!”</p><p>The young man from the heaven God sect strode towards the Qiu sisters with a cold expression.</p><p>“I’ll go in and take a look!”</p><p>The other youth from the heavenly God sect dashed into the ancient cave and saw Lu Ming sitting cross-legged.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
