If the other party is really seeking revenge, then their next target will definitely be young master Feng. As long as the other party appears, they will be unable to escape even if they have wings!</p><p>Xu long announced.</p><p>Since that night, everyone took turns to guard Feng Yi’s bedroom. On the first day, it was Lu Ming and Zhang Kong. On the second day, it was Fu Xing and Duan Yan. On the third day, it was Xu long.</p><p>That night, everything was calm and peaceful.</p><p>It was the same on the second and third days.</p><p>Six days passed in the blink of an eye. On the seventh day, it was Lu Ming and Zhang Kong’s turn again.</p><p>The night sky was quiet and the cold wind was howling.</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged in a hidden corner. He concealed his aura and spread out his spiritual sense, covering the entire Feng family mansion.</p><p>On the other side, it was Zhang Kong.</p><p>Very soon, it was late at night.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadow flashed across the night sky.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes and dashed out. He was as fast as lightning and pounced on the shadow.</p><p>On the other side, Zhang Kong had obviously sensed it too. He pounced at the same time as Lu Ming.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The shadow seemed to know that it had been discovered and quickly rushed out at an amazing speed.</p><p>Three figures rushed out of the Feng family mansion one after the other and rushed toward the six void mountain.</p><p>The six Sky Mountain was extremely huge. There were countless dangerous peaks and the terrain was extremely complicated.</p><p>As soon as the shadow rushed out of the Feng family mansion, it rushed into the six Kong mountain.</p><p>He couldn’t see his opponent’s figure at all from high up in the sky. He could only chase after his opponent by rushing into the six Sky Mountain.</p><p>Lu Ming and Zhang Kong rushed into the six Kong mountain one after another. They locked onto each other with their auras and chased after each other.</p><p>However, the other party’s speed was astonishing, and he seemed to be very familiar with the six Kong mountain’s terrain. He turned left and right in the six Kong mountain, and the two of them could not catch up with him at all.</p><p>“I’ll go to the front and block them, you chase after them!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to Zhang Kong. He then took to the air and flew high up into the sky. The black wings on his back stretched out. With a flap, Lu Ming flew forward at an extreme speed, his speed suddenly increasing by a few times.</p><p>Lu Ming had to rush to the front to block the other party and leave them no way out.</p><p>However, at this moment, a shrill scream came from the vast mountains below. It was Zhang Kong.</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed. He swooped down and rushed toward the source of the sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming landed in a Valley. The sound had come from here, but there was no one there.</p><p>“There’s blood!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw fresh blood.</p><p>Based on the smell of the blood, it was Zhang Kong’s.</p><p>But there was only blood, no one.</p><p>Lu Ming spread out his spiritual consciousness but he could not sense anything. Not only did the person from before disappear, even Zhang Kong’s aura had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. It had only been a short while and both the other party and Zhang Kong had disappeared without a trace. It was too strange.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the other party was definitely very familiar with the six Kong mountain. He might even have a secret hideout nearby.</p><p>Lu Ming started to search the vicinity. However, after searching for a while, he still found nothing.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that Zhang Kong was most likely dead.</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to return to the Feng family.</p><p>As soon as he returned to the Feng residence, he saw a group of people waiting at the main entrance.</p><p>Feng Yi and the other experts of the Feng clan.</p><p>Xu long, Fu Xing, and Duan Yan were all there, protecting Feng Yi in the middle.</p><p>At the sight of Lu Ming’s return, everyone’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, how is it? Did you catch the murderer?”</p><p>Xu long asked.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. No. The other party is very familiar with the six Kong mountain area. They didn’t catch up!</p><p>“Eh? Did he not catch up? Where is Junior Brother Zhang Kong?”</p><p>Duan Yan asked, frowning.</p><p>“Zhang Kong is probably dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming said and told him about how they had chased after the shadow.</p><p>“That can’t be right!”</p><p>After Lu Ming finished speaking, Duan Yan spoke coldly and stared at Lu Ming with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>you said that he was severely injured and even killed Junior Brother Zhang Kong in an instant, but when you went to search for him, you couldn’t find any trace of him. This place is wrong. How could he have disappeared so quickly? ”</p><p>second, you said that you have searched around but did not find Junior Brother Zhang Kong or the other party. Junior Brother Zhang Kong is at the peak of the second level Martial Emperor realm, but the other party could severely injure or even kill him. You are only at the first level Martial Emperor realm. Why didn’t the other party continue to attack you? instead, he let you check around and let you come back. Why didn’t he kill you as well? ”</p><p>Duan Yan asked indifferently.</p><p>At the side, the others also revealed doubtful expressions.</p><p>“You’re suspecting me?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>that’s right. You went out with Zhang Kong. Zhang Kong, who had a higher cultivation, died, but you didn’t. I suspect that you’re afraid of death. When you saw Zhang Kong in danger, you didn’t help him and ran back alone.</p><p>you even killed Zhang Kong. You wanted to take his treasures, didn’t you? ”</p><p>Duan Yan scolded loudly, her eyes flashing with a cunning look.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is this the case?”</p><p>Fu Xing was also staring at Lu Ming with an unfriendly expression.</p><p>“Are they going to launch an attack?”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered in his heart. Duan Yan and Fu Xing indeed had a purpose. They were deliberately going against him.</p><p>These two people were most likely from yinfeng.</p><p>“This is ridiculous. You want to punish someone, but you can’t find any excuse. Just say it!”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>Hmph, now that I’ve hit the nail on the head, you have nothing to say. You’re a suspect now. You’d better seal your cultivation and let us guard you. When the mission is over, we’ll take you back to Dragon God Valley to accept your punishment!</p><p>Duan Yan said.</p><p>“Hehe, sealing your own cultivation? Alright, come over here, I’ll see if you can seal me off!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. A cold murderous intent flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>If he sealed his cultivation, the other party would be able to deal with him however they wanted. How could Lu Ming seal his cultivation? It was simply laughable.</p><p>“You want to resist?”</p><p>Duan Yan said coldly.</p><p>Previously, she had heard that although Lu Ming had just broken through to the martial Royal realm, his combat strength was shocking. In the great emperor secret realm, even geniuses like he Yu were not his match.</p><p>Although her cultivation level was two levels higher than Lu Ming’s, she was not confident that she could defeat him.</p><p>nonsense. If I say you’re guilty and kneel down, will you? ”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Hmph, you’re the most suspicious of Zhang Kong’s death today. You have to give us an explanation.</p><p>Duan Yan berated.</p><p>“Explanation? Who Do You Think You Are? Why do I need to give you an explanation?”</p><p>Lu Ming said in disdain.</p><p>This made Duan Yan and Fu Xing’s faces turn ugly.</p><p>alright, today’s incident might not be Junior Brother Lu Ming’s fault. Duan Yan, stop making wild guesses. Our top priority now is to find the murderer and complete this mission!</p><p>Xu long said, trying to smooth things over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
