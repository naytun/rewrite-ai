It’s an ordinary bright Saint weapon, worth one million contribution points. Five King weapons are worth fifty thousand contribution points, so the total is one million and fifty thousand contribution points. Little guy, give me your identity token!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming passed his identity token to the elder. In the next moment, 1.05 million contribution points appeared in his identity token. In addition to the 50000 contribution points he had left, he had a total of 1.1 million contribution points.</p><p>“Little guy, what kind of treasure do you want to exchange?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>“Senior, are there any glove-type Saint weapons here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>He’d always wanted to buy a holy weapon in the glove category. This would be a great boost for his close combat skills.</p><p>in Dragon God Valley, due to the bloodline, there are many people who practice fist, palm, and finger techniques. They need many glove-type weapons, so there are no glove-type Saint weapons in Treasure Dragon Palace for the time being!</p><p>furthermore, the forging process for glove-type Saint weapons is much more complicated and difficult, so they’re two to three times more expensive than ordinary Saint weapons!</p><p>The old man shook his head and explained.</p><p>“So expensive?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly.</p><p>It was two to three times more expensive than a normal Saint weapon. Even if the treasure Dragon Palace had one, they wouldn’t be able to afford it.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head. He could only think of a way to obtain a holy weapon like a glove in the future. He would exchange for something else first.</p><p>“Senior, I would like to exchange for some mystical materials, such as purple flame crystal, Dragon Carp, fire spiritual root …” Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Lu Ming listed out the seven main ingredients needed to refine the Nirvana elixir.</p><p>This was the yuan continent, so he might be able to collect those materials. In the future, when he had the chance to return to the divine wilderness continent, he could refine the Nirvana elixir, which would be of great use.</p><p>“Little fellow, are you trying to refine the Nirvana pill?”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. This old man also knew about the Nirvana pill. Furthermore, he knew about the Nirvana pill the moment Lu Ming mentioned a few mystical materials. Could it be that he also had the pill formula of the Nirvana pill?</p><p>“Little fellow, you might as well directly exchange for Nirvana pills instead of these materials!”</p><p>The old man continued.</p><p>“Directly exchange for Nirvana pills? There’s Nirvana pills to exchange here?”</p><p>Lu Ming could not help asking.</p><p>haha, of course. Nirvana pills are not precious. Almost every sect in the yuanlu continent has them. Even many small families and small forces have them. They can be used to improve the bloodline level of some juniors and enhance their talent!</p><p>The old man laughed.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. The Nirvana elixir, which he regarded as a treasure, was actually a common item in the yuan continent.</p><p>It made sense. There were too many geniuses in the yuan continent. For a big sect like Dragon God Valley, the minimum standard for recruiting disciples was to awaken ninth level divine bloodline. Many who had awakened ninth level divine bloodline could not even join a big sect like Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Therefore, Nirvana pills were not a rare pill in the yuan continent.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the formula for the Nirvana elixir that he obtained in the divine wilderness continent was most likely brought back from the yuan continent by some Emperor.</p><p>It was common in the yuan continent, but in the divine wilderness continent, it was priceless.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll exchange for the Nirvana elixir then. I wonder how many contribution points it costs?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>10000 medium-grade raw stones for one, which is 100 contribution points for one!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“So cheap!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he smiled bitterly in his heart.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, Nirvana elixirs that all the factions would go crazy for were really cheap here. An Emperor weapon could be exchanged for a hundred of them.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll exchange for 1000 pills. Do you have any?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>If he brought a thousand of them back to the divine wilderness continent, how many geniuses would the Dragon Alliance produce?</p><p>“Yes, I have a lot of Nirvana pills!”</p><p>The old man smiled, took out a storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>With a thought, a Jade bottle appeared in Lu Ming’s hand. It contained Nirvana pills. Judging from the quality, it was much better than the ones he had refined in the past.</p><p>this kind of Nirvana pill can raise a person’s bloodline by three to four levels, or even more!</p><p>The old man explained.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning with passion.</p><p>He really hoped that he could immediately fly back to the divine wilderness continent and give these Nirvana pills to his family and friends.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh. The cultivation level of the divine wilderness continent was far inferior to that of the yuan continent.</p><p>In the divine wilderness continent, it was a Supreme treasure. In the yuan continent, it was very likely to be a common item.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the Nirvana elixir. The contribution points on his identity token were reduced by 100000 contribution points, leaving him with one million contribution points.</p><p>“Senior, I would like to exchange for 50 kilograms of myriad spirit liquid!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought for a moment and decided to exchange his remaining contribution points for the myriad spirit liquid.</p><p>He had wanted to exchange for a space-breaking flying shuttle, but after asking around, he found out that the price of a space-breaking flying shuttle was even more shocking. He couldn’t afford it at all. He might as well buy all the myriad spirit liquid to water the ancient tree of comprehension and let it grow.</p><p>During his trip to the wasteland of death, he saw the Titan longhorn beetle sitting cross-legged under the path-understanding ancient tree. The path-understanding ancient tree had left a deep impression on Lu Ming.</p><p>It was as high as the sky, covering the sky and covering the sun. On the branches, the great Dao curled up. If one sat down and cultivated, comprehending the great Dao of heaven and earth, the effect would definitely be amazing.</p><p>That was the true path-understanding ancient tree. Lu Ming’s current path-understanding ancient tree could not be compared to it.</p><p>Lu Ming was looking forward to it. He hoped that one day, he would be able to cultivate the path-understanding ancient tree to such a scale.</p><p>“So much myriad spirit liquid?”</p><p>The old man was surprised.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t have any?”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>yes, I’m just a little surprised. Wait for me for a moment!</p><p>The old man left the counter and returned not long later. He gave Lu Ming a storage ring with ten bottles of myriad spirit liquid in it. In total, they weighed exactly 50 kilograms.</p><p>Lu Ming received it in joy. The contribution points on the identity token had become zero.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled bitterly. He was really poor.</p><p>Since he had exchanged the treasures he needed, Lu Ming returned to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming entered the mountain and river diagram after he returned to the cave abode.</p><p>On the peak of a mountain, the path-understanding ancient tree swayed and released waves of heavenly Dao aura. Paopao lay under the path-understanding ancient tree, her body emitting a milky-white Radiance. The space around her body rippled like water.</p><p>Ever since bubbles had obtained the time and space spinel from the Titan longhorn beetle, her cultivation base had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><p>He had already broken through to the third level of the martial Royal realm a few days ago, and now he was trying to break through to the fourth level.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and his gaze fell on the path-understanding ancient tree again.</p><p>After this period of time, the path-understanding ancient tree had grown a lot. It had already grown two side branches. On it, there were more than ten tender green leaves. Although it couldn’t be compared to the path-understanding ancient tree of the Titan Deva, it had grown many times more than when it had first arrived in the yuan continent.</p><p>Lu Ming took out a Jade bottle and poured five kilograms of myriad spirit liquid on the root of the ancient path-understanding tree.</p><p>Lu Ming then exited the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>After exiting the mountain and river diagram, Lu Ming left his cave abode and headed deep into the cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming’s target was the cloud Dragon Valley master’s library, where he could find his cultivation experience.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming arrived at the cloud Dragon Valley master’s library.</p><p>There were many books in the library. Lu Ming picked some important books and started reading.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
