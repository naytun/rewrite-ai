When the mark of the heavenly path was completely refined, Lu Ming opened his eyes and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Peak rank 3!”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>His Chaos Domain had finally reached the peak of level three. The two hundred thousand raw stones were worth it.</p><p>However, it was not that easy to break through to level four.</p><p>A fourth-level territory was equivalent to a middle-stage Martial Emperor’s territory. There was a barrier that was not easy to cross.</p><p>Lu Ming got up and looked at the seventh floating platform. He then turned back and looked at the Silver City.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming did not continue to move upwards. Instead, he took a step forward and landed under the floating platform.</p><p>Floating platform. He could continue to climb the platform as long as he paid the raw stones. He had to get the 500000 contribution points from the Silver City first.</p><p>I’ve passed the sixth floating platform while you’ve failed. I’ve won the bet this time. Hand over 500000 contribution points!</p><p>Lu Ming looked at the silver Blizzard city.</p><p>“Five hundred thousand contribution points? What 500,000 contribution points?”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City feigned ignorance as a cold smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. The silver Blizzard city was playing dumb. They were obviously trying to renege on their debt.</p><p>you want to play dumb and not pay up? hehe, there are many people here who can be witnesses!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Witness? why didn’t I hear that?”</p><p>“I didn’t hear it either!”</p><p>A few of the silver Blizzard city’s companions coldly spoke.</p><p>“Did you guys hear that?”</p><p>Blizzard Silver’s cold eyes looked at the others.</p><p>Many people’s faces changed, revealing a look of fear.</p><p>Yincheng was a cousin of Yin Feng. His grandfather was the younger brother of the master of Silver Dragon Valley. He had a strong background in Silver Dragon Valley, and many people didn’t dare to offend him.</p><p>Although some people disdained the silver Blizzard city’s conduct, they all looked away and didn’t speak.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered, a sharp glint in his eyes.</p><p>“I … I can be a witness, just now … Just now, the two of you did indeed have a bet. The bet is five hundred thousand contribution points!”</p><p>At this moment, a timid voice sounded.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His words made Blizzard Silver City and his companions look towards the source of the voice.</p><p>Lu Ming also looked over.</p><p>It was a young woman. She was petite, but her skin was fair. She had a delicate appearance and was extremely cute.</p><p>At this moment, when the silver Blizzard city’s gaze swept over him, his face paled, his body trembled, and he couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>“Little girl, what did you say?”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City coldly spoke.</p><p>“I … I don’t want to lie, you two did have a bet!”</p><p>Although the young woman was very scared, she still spoke.</p><p>“Good, very good!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver’s eyes became even sharper, and even murderous intent filled them.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You want to kill people when they tell the truth. This is the style of the silver Dragon Valley, just like Yin Feng. It seems that I have to report it to the Dragon punishment Palace!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. He took a step forward and stood in front of the young woman.</p><p>also, hand over the 500000 contribution points!</p><p>Lu Ming continued.</p><p>“Hehe, Lu Ming, you’re really naive. I was just making a casual remark about the bet previously and you took it seriously. We didn’t sign any written agreement!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City quibbled.</p><p>it turns out that people in Silver Dragon Valley are all like this. From top to bottom, they’re all villains. They’re such a disgrace to the Dragon God Valley. In my opinion, Silver Dragon Valley is purely a cancer of the Dragon God Valley. It must be removed sooner or later!</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sneered.</p><p>How dare you! Who Do You Think You Are? how dare you comment on the affairs of Silver Dragon Valley!</p><p>A young man shouted from the edge of the Silver City.</p><p>Lu Ming, you’re the one who’s lawless and lawless. You hurt your fellow disciples. Previously, you injured three of my junior brothers for no reason. I’m going to settle this with you!</p><p>Blizzard Silver City shouted, pointing at the three young men beside him.</p><p>The three young men were pale and weak.</p><p>The cold light in Lu Ming’s eyes intensified.</p><p>His loud shout had injured the three of them, but it was only a light injury. With the strength of their spirit bodies, those minor injuries had already healed.</p><p>But now, he looked like he was seriously injured. It was clearly intentional.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you severely injured a disciple of the silver Dragon Valley for no reason. Now, hand over 500000 contribution points as the medical fee!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City shouted, his aura overbearing.</p><p>“Who’s there? How dare you hurt the disciples of Silver Dragon Valley?”</p><p>At this moment, a cold voice sounded from a floating platform. A figure floated down. It was a cold-looking young man.</p><p>“Senior brother Ding Mao!”</p><p>Seeing this young man, Blizzard Silver City and the others were overjoyed and quickly packed their bags.</p><p>“Senior brother Ding Mao, it’s Lu Ming. He injured three of my disciples for no reason. I’m going to ask him for compensation!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City said.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>Ding Mao’s eyes glinted coldly at the mention of Lu Ming’s name.”Hmph, just because he’s the cloud Dragon Valley master’s direct disciple, can he really be lawless? Let him pay for the treatment, and then take him to the Dragon Punishment Hall!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City responded, his courage growing. He stared at Lu Ming and said, Lu Ming, hurry up. Hand over five hundred thousand contribution points and follow us to the Dragon Punishment Hall!</p><p>At the side, some people sighed.</p><p>The silver Dragon Valley had gone too far.</p><p>Initially, the silver Blizzard city had made a bet with Lu Ming, betting 500000 contribution points. In the end, Lu Ming had won. Not only did the silver Blizzard city not pay up, but they had also accused Lu Ming of being guilty. They wanted Lu Ming to hand over 500000 contribution points and take him to the Dragon Punishment Hall.</p><p>How despicable!</p><p>However, they could only think about it in their hearts. So what if he was despicable? Who asked the silver Blizzard city to be so strong?</p><p>What would Lu Ming do? To hand it over or not?</p><p>Many people looked at Lu Ming, guessing what his choice would be.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression remained calm, but the glint in his eyes was sharper.</p><p>if you don’t hand over 500000 contribution points today, don’t you ever leave this place!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>Many people were shocked. How arrogant.</p><p>Lu Ming had completely ignored the silver Blizzard city’s earlier nonsense. He just wanted the silver Blizzard city to hand over five hundred thousand contribution points.</p><p>Ding Mao’s body glowed with a cold light. this person is stubborn. You guys take him down first!</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Blizzard Silver City and the others exploded with powerful auras.</p><p>“Lu Ming, How dare you! Kneel down!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City shouted. He unleashed all his cultivation and threw a palm at Lu Ming.</p><p>Blizzard Silver city’s cultivation had reached the peak of the fifth level martial Royal realm, and his territory had reached the sixth level. His combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>The other two young men were at the LV 5 martial Royal realm and had strong combat strength.</p><p>“You’re the one kneeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold. Two rays of black light pierced through Blizzard Silver city’s body like divine swords, bombarding his soul.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, Lu Ming’s divine sword technique was already very amazing.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City let out a shrill scream. He felt that his soul was almost cut in half. The pain of his soul being torn apart made him lose his will to fight. The palm print collapsed on its own halfway.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
