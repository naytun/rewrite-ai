It could still block the stronger ones.</p><p>...</p><p>The three of them advanced another thousand miles or so before finally reaching the end.</p><p>The passage disappeared. In front of them was a flat piece of land, but it was filled with gray fog.</p><p>The mist greatly affected one’s vision.</p><p>Some of the young men rushed into the mist and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other two did not hesitate and rushed into the fog.</p><p>It was completely silent in the mist, as if there were no living beings. Only the heartbeats of the three could be heard.</p><p>However, after walking for a while, only one of the three had their hearts beating.</p><p>Lu Ming turned around and saw that Qiu Yingying and Qiu Hao were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Just a moment ago, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao had been following behind him. How did they suddenly disappear?</p><p>“Ying Ying, brother Qiu!”</p><p>Lu Ming called out. His voice could be heard from afar but there was no response.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around but did not see anyone.</p><p>Earlier, there were clearly many young men who had rushed in, but now, there was not a single person.</p><p>“Could it be. formation? no, it’s not. formation …”</p><p>Lu Ming observed carefully. There was no array at all.</p><p>this area is very strange. It can affect one’s senses. Perhaps they are not far from me, but we can’t see each other!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>In this world, there were many wondrous places that had even more mysterious functions than formations that no one had laid down.</p><p>“It seems like we can only meet up after we leave this area!”</p><p>At the thought of this, Lu Ming identified the direction and walked straight ahead.</p><p>However, Lu Ming stopped after a short while.</p><p>He discovered that there was an invisible energy in the surroundings that was seeping into his body and slowly attacking his soul.</p><p>Yes, there was an invisible energy here that could attack the soul.</p><p>Even his Chaos Domain found it difficult to defend against it.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming’s soul had been tempered in the world refining tribulation Bell when he was going through the martial Royal realm Great Tribulation. It was dozens of times stronger than before. This attack did not matter to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and continued to move forward.</p><p>Along the way, he found many pits on the ground, some of which looked like palm prints.</p><p>“Could it be that in the distant past, there was a great battle here?”</p><p>Lu Ming made a guess.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on the ground. However, the ground did not move at all. There was not a single mark.</p><p>“It’s so hard!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>The ground here was made of a strange metal that was strong and indestructible. Even with Lu Ming’s power, he could not leave a single mark on it.</p><p>The thing that had left so many potholes on the ground was definitely a terrifying existence.</p><p>As Lu Ming advanced, he realized that the energy that attacked the soul was getting stronger.</p><p>Although it was nothing to Lu Ming’s current soul strength, it was definitely a great test for some of the other prodigies.</p><p>“What a powerful fluctuation ahead …”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He discovered that there were waves of fluctuations coming over. They were very strong, as if there was an expert cultivating in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming hesitated for a moment. He concealed his aura and decided to go and take a look.</p><p>Soon, a huge object appeared in front of them.</p><p>It was an Eagle, a Giant Eagle, with golden feathers and the size of a mountain.</p><p>The fluctuations were coming from this Giant Eagle.</p><p>However, this Golden Eagle was obviously dead. There was no sign of life on its body.</p><p>However, the fluctuation was indeed extremely terrifying. The closer he got, the more Lu Ming felt that it was terrifying.</p><p>it’s the aura of a Saint realm expert. Moreover, this fluctuation is even more profound than that of an ordinary Saint realm expert!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Lu Ming had sensed the auras of the mysterious sky Saint and elder Hong of the Dragon God Valley, but they were not as good as the Golden Eagle.</p><p>This giant Golden Eagle was definitely not just a bright Saint. It was even an eminent Saint or an absolute Saint.</p><p>“There are words!”</p><p>All of a sudden, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He noticed that under one of the Golden eagle’s wings, there was a word,’evil’!</p><p>Evil!</p><p>What did it mean? Lu Ming did not know.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming did not see any wounds around the Eagle’s body. He had no idea how the Eagle had died.</p><p>I wonder if I can keep this Giant Eagle. Its entire body is full of treasures!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts.</p><p>He took out a storage ring of higher quality and circulated his Zhen Yuan, causing the ring to fly above the Eagle. A gravitational force was generated from the ring.</p><p>To Lu Ming’s surprise, he easily put away the giant Eagle’s corpse.</p><p>“Haha, I’ve earned it!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He kept the storage ring and continued on his way.</p><p>This area was deathly silent, as if Lu Ming was the only one in this vast world. This feeling would drive one crazy if they stayed too long.</p><p>Moreover, there was an invisible energy that continuously seeped into Lu Ming’s body and attacked his soul.</p><p>He did not know how long he had been walking. When Lu Ming took a step forward, the surrounding environment suddenly changed drastically.</p><p>The fog disappeared and Lu Ming came to a platform.</p><p>A step away, so close yet so far.</p><p>He walked out of the fog just like that.</p><p>Voices could be heard from the front. Lu Ming looked over and realized that there were many people gathered there.</p><p>“Qiu Ying Ying, Qiu Hao!”</p><p>Lu Ming saw two people at a glance.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>When the two of them saw Lu Ming, they walked over in joy.</p><p>“When did you guys pass through the misty area?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>“I’ve only just arrived …”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained.</p><p>Their encounter was exactly the same as Lu Ming’s. After entering the misty area, they were separated from the rest. It was as if they were the only one left in the world.</p><p>There was also that kind of energy that attacked the soul. They gritted their teeth and continued forward. They didn’t expect to successfully pass through the foggy area.</p><p>However, they were different from Lu Ming. Lu Ming had touched the giant Eagle’s corpse, while they had not touched anything.</p><p>“Lu Ming!”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice was heard. Three young men walked over and greeted Lu Ming.</p><p>It was the three Ruan brothers.</p><p>The three brothers of the ruan clan were connected by heart. When they worked together, they were not weak. After entering the great emperor secret realm, they had successfully broken through to the martial Royal realm. It was not strange that they had come here.</p><p>“What’s going on in front?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was fixed ahead.</p><p>In front of him, many people stopped, as if they were blocked.</p><p>there’s an abyss in front of us. It’s blocking our way!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying explained.</p><p>Lu Ming walked closer to take a look. It was indeed an abyss that was a hundred miles wide. At the bottom of the abyss, there was a terrifying devouring power. Once people flew into the abyss, they would be devoured and fall into the abyss. No one could escape.</p><p>He couldn’t fly over this abyss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
