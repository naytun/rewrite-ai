Charge!</p><p>As soon as someone moved, the others could no longer hold back and rushed toward the goshawk’s mouth.</p><p>...</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The crowd swarmed towards the goshawk’s mouth. Lu Ming, Qiu Yingying, and Qiu Hao followed the crowd.</p><p>The person at the front had already rushed into the fly’s mouth, and there was no danger.</p><p>The moment they saw that everything was fine, the people behind them charged forward even more frantically.</p><p>Who knew if they would obtain some Supreme treasure if they entered earlier? everyone naturally went crazy.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>As Lu Ming was flying, a terrifying palm print shot out from behind him.</p><p>Lu Ming raised his eyebrows. He did not even look at it. He turned his hand and struck out with his palm, clashing with the palm print behind him.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The force was unrestrained. Lu Ming twisted his body and looked behind him.</p><p>A young man in a white robe glanced at Lu Ming with a cold gaze, then sped forward.</p><p>“The people of the heavenly God sect!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>Obviously, this white-robed young man from the heavenly God sect wanted to kill him. He had sneaked an attack on him from behind when he was not paying attention.</p><p>“Tian Shen sect, thank you nianjun!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a low voice, his voice cold.</p><p>They continued to fly and soon, Lu Ming and the rest flew into the passage.</p><p>The goshawk was huge, so the passage was also huge. It did not seem crowded at all when a large group of people flew in.</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, a shrill scream came from the front.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“There’s danger ahead!”</p><p>Someone exclaimed.</p><p>&Nbsp; whoosh …</p><p>At this moment, an ear-piercing sound came from the front, and it was getting closer.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, beams of black light shot out from the walls on both sides of the passage.</p><p>Immediately, someone screamed as the black light pierced through his body and he died.</p><p>“Defend!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw a few consecutive punches and destroyed dozens of black rays of light.</p><p>Lu Ming saw it clearly. This black light was not a physical entity, but it was very powerful and had a terrifying penetrative power. Many people circulated their vital essence to defend but it was useless. They were penetrated by the black light.</p><p>those below the Emperor realm withdraw! Those below the Emperor realm withdraw!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Those below the Emperor level couldn’t block the light at all and would be shot to death.</p><p>Screams rang out continuously as people were shot to death.</p><p>In the passage, domains spread out.</p><p>Those who had broken through to the Emperor realm had to use their domain and true essence to protect themselves. They could barely block the attack of the black light.</p><p>On Qiu Ying Ying’s body, the feather clothing emitted a light that covered her entire body, blocking the surrounding light.</p><p>Qiu Hao, on the other hand, had a Golden Bell floating above his head, casting down a light screen that easily blocked the light.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was enveloped by the chaos Domain and the light could not touch him at all.</p><p>The group didn’t retreat and continued to fly forward.</p><p>Along the way, they saw many corpses.</p><p>However, most of them were Supremes, and only a few emperors were killed by them if they were not careful.</p><p>However, as he continued to advance, the power of the black light also slowly became stronger.</p><p>In the beginning, it shot out from the left and right sides, but behind it, left, right, up, down, there was endless black light shooting out with astonishing power.</p><p>Slowly, some of the sovereigns were unable to resist.</p><p>This passage was extremely long.</p><p>Everyone flew for a thousand miles and still had not reached the end.</p><p>“Damn it, I’m not willing to accept this!”</p><p>Someone roared because they couldn’t hold on much longer. If they went any further, they would die.</p><p>He could only leave unwillingly.</p><p>As he continued forward, it became more and more difficult to walk.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying, and Qiu Hao had it easy.</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao’s treasures were Saint weapons with amazing defensive power.</p><p>Naturally, this attracted the attention of others.</p><p>what a profound treasure. If I can obtain it, I will be able to enter Emperor Cang’s bedroom!</p><p>Some people’s eyes flashed with greed.</p><p>Many people surrounded the three of them.</p><p>“How can you enjoy such a treasure? give it to me!”</p><p>A young man with a cold look in his eyes threw a palm toward Qiu Hao.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The Golden Bell above Qiu Hao’s head trembled, and an invisible ripple spread out, rushing towards the young man. The young man’s face changed, and he retreated.</p><p>what a wondrous treasure. It must be a Saint weapon. Hand it over!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The other young man also stepped out and charged at Qiu Hao.</p><p>There were also a few people who charged towards Qiu Ying Ying.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted coldly. He strode forward and extended his hand to attack the few young men.</p><p>“Brat, it’s good that I didn’t come looking for you. You’re such a busybody, go to hell!”</p><p>One of the young men snorted coldly and struck Lu Ming with his palm.</p><p>However, Lu Ming threw a punch and the violent fist force crushed over. The young man screamed and flew backward. His protective true energy and territory were shattered by Lu Ming’s punch. His body was instantly pierced by the dense black light and he died on the spot.</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming threw a few consecutive punches, sending a few more young men flying. His vital essence and territory were penetrated by Lu Ming, and they all died under the black light.</p><p>The remaining young men’s expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Lu Ming’s combat strength was too strong. He completely crushed them.</p><p>At that moment, an extremely sharp force attacked Lu Ming from behind.</p><p>Lu Ming knew that it was sword Qi the moment he heard it. It was extremely sharp and the person who attacked must be shockingly powerful.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>He activated the wind elemental technique. At the critical moment, Lu Ming’s figure shifted one meter to the side and avoided the sword.</p><p>“You again!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s killing intent burst forth when he saw the person who had launched the sneak attack.</p><p>This person was the white-robed young man from the heavenly God sect who had sneaked an attack on Lu Ming outside the passage.</p><p>“You’re lucky!”</p><p>The white-robed young man’s attack had failed, so he retreated and wanted to retreat.</p><p>“You’ve attacked me time and time again, and now you want to leave? have you asked for my permission?”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. The aura on his body surged. He took a step forward and rushed toward the white-robed young man at top speed.</p><p>The black light did not pose much of a threat to Lu Ming.</p><p>The young man in white’s expression changed when he saw Lu Ming charging at him. He dashed forward at top speed, but his speed was no match for Lu Ming’s.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Lu Ming was already close to him.</p><p>“Brat, you dare to attack me? I’m an elder of the heavenly God sect’s …”</p><p>Seeing that he could not escape, the white-robed young man turned around and shouted at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming charged at the other party.</p><p>This person was really naive. He had tried to ambush Lu Ming time and time again, trying to kill Lu Ming. Now, he actually brought up his backer to threaten Lu Ming. Wasn’t he stupid?</p><p>The white-robed young man’s words were swallowed back by Lu Ming’s punch. He could only try his best to resist.</p><p>Sword lights bloomed from his hands with astonishing power.</p><p>This person should have an innate spirit body and his cultivation had reached the peak of the LV 1 martial Royal realm. His combat strength was not bad, but he was no match for Lu Ming.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch shattered all the sword gleams. The remaining force of the punch landed on the white-robed young man’s protective true energy and territory. The white-robed young man was sent flying and crashed into the wall. He was almost killed by the black light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
