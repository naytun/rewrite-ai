It was shockingly long, and they had yet to reach the end.</p><p>...</p><p>“The walls here seem to be covered with inscriptions!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying said softly.</p><p>Lu Ming scanned the room. Indeed, the walls here were covered with inscriptions. These inscriptions had a strange structure and were combined in a very strange way. It looked very strange.</p><p>Furthermore, the inscriptions didn’t seem to have any abnormalities at all. It was as if too much time had passed and they had lost their spirituality.</p><p>“Brother Lu, be careful.”</p><p>Suddenly, Qiu Ying Ying exclaimed.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. Without thinking, he moved a few meters to the side.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>A wisp of strange Black Thorn pierced the place where Lu Ming had been standing just now.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Following that, more black stingers were aimed at Lu Ming, Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s body flashed and dodged the black spikes. Qiu Ying Ying and Qiu Hao also dodged the attacks, but they seemed to be in a sorry state.</p><p>“Despicable! It’s yin Feng!”</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying glared at the front.</p><p>Lu Ming naturally saw it too. In front of him, Yin Feng stood under the wall with his palm pressed against the wall. There was a fluorescent flash. The Black Thorn just now was shot out from the wall that Yin Feng’s palm was pressed against.</p><p>Yin Feng had used a special method to activate the inscriptions on the wall to attack them.</p><p>“Hehe, you guys are lucky!”</p><p>Yin Feng sneered. His figure flashed and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>despicable! Before the sage realm elder came in, he warned us to unite, but Yin Feng tried to kill us in secret!</p><p>Qiu Ying Ying gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Despicable!”</p><p>Qiu Hao also said hatefully.</p><p>It had been very dangerous just now. They felt that those strange black thorns were extremely terrifying. If they had been stabbed, they would have been in grave danger.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He did not say much.</p><p>After that, the group became more careful and continued forward.</p><p>After traveling for about a hundred miles, there was gradually light in front, and it was no longer pitch black.</p><p>The pressure in everyone’s heart finally eased a little.</p><p>After walking for a while, everyone stopped.</p><p>That was because a deep abyss had appeared in front of them.</p><p>The abyss blocked the way.</p><p>On the abyss, there were ten bridges that led to the other side.</p><p>However, in front of the abyss, there was a stone tablet with four words written on it: Nine deaths and one life!</p><p>Ten bridges corresponded to nine deaths and one life!</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Did this mean that out of the ten bridges, nine were dead ends and one was a way out?</p><p>But how was he going to get through this?</p><p>Which way was the way out?</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>Someone said.</p><p>isn’t this simple? find ten people and we’ll know once we try!</p><p>A cold voice rang out from the crowd. It was Yin Feng.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Finding 10 people to try this method was very simple, but nine of them would die. Those who tried it would only have a slim chance of survival.</p><p>Who would be willing to try?</p><p>Going there would mean death!</p><p>“Isn’t that simple? you, you, and you, get up there!”</p><p>Yin Feng pointed at ten people.</p><p>Among them were Lu Ming, Qiu Yingying, Qiu Hao, and the ruan triplets.</p><p>“Why should I go up and try? Impossible, you can go if you want to!”</p><p>One of the people who was called out shouted.</p><p>“What are you shouting for? Lowly ants from a Savage Island, our Dragon God Valley crossed an endless distance to summon you here and let you enter the great emperor secret realm, giving you the chance to obtain Supreme opportunities. Are you not going to do anything? Now, it’s time for you to contribute!”</p><p>Yin Feng coldly laughed.</p><p>“That’s right. Hurry up and go up. With your strength, this is all you can do. Otherwise, what are you doing here? Are you just freeloading?”</p><p>Another young man beside Yin Feng sneered.</p><p>“No, I’m not going!”</p><p>The young man shouted and shook his head in refusal.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes turned cold. His figure suddenly appeared beside the young man and he threw a punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The young man’s body was sent flying far away. He spat out a large mouthful of blood and his aura was extremely weak.</p><p>“No, I’ll kill you now!”</p><p>Yin Feng’s eyes were as cold as lightning as he swept his gaze over Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Lu Ming pursed his lips.</p><p>Lu Ming did not lower his voice and his voice could be heard from afar.</p><p>“What did you just say?”</p><p>Yin Feng glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Not only are they stupid, but they also have bad ears!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a disdainful glance at yinfeng.</p><p>“Kid, it’s time for you to contribute to Dragon God Valley. Do you want to make so many people wait for you? If you let the other sects get the first move, can you bear the responsibility?”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted.</p><p>The other local young men sneered as they watched.</p><p>The other young men from the overseas continent looked on coldly.</p><p>To them, it was the best for Lu Ming to go up. At least they did not have to take the risk. If Lu Ming did not go, what if Yin Feng found them?</p><p>“Since you want to contribute so much to Dragon God Valley, why don’t you do it yourself? Wouldn’t it be more efficient?”</p><p>Lu Ming said calmly.</p><p>“Who Do You Think You Are? Can your life be compared to mine?”</p><p>Yin Feng shouted coldly.</p><p>yinfeng, why are you wasting time with him? if you’re not going up, just throw him up!</p><p>The young man who had spoken to Yin Feng earlier said coldly. At the same time, he strode toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, I’m too lazy to talk nonsense with you. Do you want to go on your own, or do you want me to throw you over?”</p><p>The young man was dressed in a purple robe. He had a cold expression on his face as he tried to grab Lu Ming.</p><p>“Throw it over, I think that’s a good idea!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered. The early stage of the chaos realm enveloped his body and he threw a punch at the purple-robed young man.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The purple-robed young man’s body trembled violently and blood spurted out of his mouth. Just as he was about to be sent flying by Lu Ming, Lu Ming took a step forward and slapped the purple-robed young man across the face.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp sound of a slap was heard, and the purple-robed young man’s body fell heavily to the ground. The sound of bones breaking could be heard.</p><p>It was unknown what the ground was made of, but it was unbelievably hard and indestructible.</p><p>The purple-robed young man lay on the ground, wailing like a dead dog.</p><p>“Brat, you’re bold!”</p><p>impudent! How dare you hurt people? ants from the wilderness! You’re courting death!</p><p>Lu Ming had beaten the purple-robed young man half to death with one move, shocking everyone. Then, the dozen local young men shouted one by one, their bodies emitting cold killing intent. Their figures flashed and they surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>In their eyes, a mere ant from a desolate Island dared to attack them. He was really courting death.</p><p>“It seems that we have enough people to try ten bridges!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>“What did you just say? Big words, die!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>The next moment …</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch landed on his dantian. He let out a shrill scream and lay on the ground, unable to move.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>“Ah!” “Ah!” “Ah!”</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming cast the wind element technique and his body flashed. The scene was filled with screams. Then, the dozen or so young men who wanted to besiege Lu Ming all lay on the ground, wailing in pain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
