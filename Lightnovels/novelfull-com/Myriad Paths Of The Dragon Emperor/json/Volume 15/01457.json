It was a subsidiary family of the Dragon God Valley, which was quite far away from the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The five of them traveled day and night, and it took them ten days to reach the Feng family.</p><p>...</p><p>“What a cold and sinister aura!”</p><p>Duan Yan shuddered as she approached the Feng family.</p><p>Everyone’s brows furrowed slightly. They felt that the air here was particularly cold.</p><p>In front of them, there was a continuous stretch of palace buildings, and a group of people came out to welcome them.</p><p>The leader of the group was a young man with a pale face. When he saw Lu Ming and the rest, the young man quickly saluted them.”Feng Yi of the Feng family greets the Dragon God Valley’s high ambassadors!”</p><p>“No need to be so polite!”</p><p>Xu long waved his hand and said.</p><p>After the introduction, everyone knew that Feng Yi was the only son of the Feng family’s master. Those who followed Feng Yi to welcome them were all high-level figures of the Feng family.</p><p>“Everyone, please come in to talk!”</p><p>Feng Yi welcomed Lu Ming and the rest into the Feng family mansion.</p><p>“A very cold feeling!”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows as he entered the Feng family mansion. He felt that the atmosphere was even colder.</p><p>“Did anything happen to the Feng family during this time?”</p><p>In the hall of the Feng family, everyone took their seats and Xu long was the first to speak.</p><p>“Three days ago, my third uncle also died!”</p><p>Feng Yi said with a sorrowful expression.</p><p>The other members of the Feng family all looked terrified.</p><p>It was unknown who the Feng family had offended. The higher-ups of the Feng family had died mysteriously one after another. During this period, the Feng family had fallen into a state of panic.</p><p>No one knew who would be the next one.</p><p>“Do you know how he died?”</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>I don’t know. We’ve checked it carefully. There’s no wound, not a single wound!</p><p>Feng Yi said, shaking his head.</p><p>“No wound? How is that possible?”</p><p>Fu Xing said, clearly in disbelief.</p><p>it’s true. We’ve checked carefully. My father, my second uncle, and my third uncle are all the same. There’s no wound at all. They seemed to have died suddenly. But they were all martial Royal realm experts, so it’s impossible for them to die suddenly. Someone must have done this in secret!</p><p>Feng Yi said through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Does your Feng family have any enemies?”</p><p>Xu long asked.</p><p>the Feng family is considered weak in the six Kong mountain area. We usually do things with fear and trepidation. We don’t dare to offend other forces. Therefore, the Feng family has always been on good terms with other families and forces. We have almost no enemies!</p><p>Feng Yi said.</p><p>Xu long, Lu Ming, and the others frowned.</p><p>No enemies, no wounds, no clues, how could they investigate?</p><p>Could it be that he had to wait for an opportunity?</p><p>Wait for the other party to attack again?</p><p>The hall suddenly quieted down, and the atmosphere became heavy.</p><p>“I suggest we open the coffin and do an autopsy!”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice broke the silence.</p><p>The person who spoke was Lu Ming.</p><p>“Open the coffin and perform an autopsy?”</p><p>Everyone’s gaze turned to Lu Ming.</p><p>“This … That’s not good. My father and the others have just been buried not long ago. It’s a little disrespectful to open a school now!”</p><p>Feng Yi said.</p><p>“I also agree to open the coffin and perform an autopsy. Otherwise, how can we investigate without any clues? If the other party doesn’t make a move after this, wouldn’t this matter be left unsettled?”</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>Then, Fu Xing, Duan Yan, and Zhang Kong all agreed to open the coffin and perform an autopsy.</p><p>Feng Yi’s expression changed. In the end, he gritted his teeth and nodded, agreeing to this matter.</p><p>They acted immediately. Under the lead of Feng Yi and a few higher-ups of the Feng family, they went to the back mountain.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the burial place of the Feng family head and the others.</p><p>Feng Yi arranged for the Feng family to take action. Soon, three purple-gold coffins were placed in front of Xu long and the others. The lids of the coffins were already opened.</p><p>Three middle-aged men were lying quietly in the purple-gold coffins.</p><p>The three of them were all emperors, and their corpses would not rot unless they were more than a hundred years old. Even now, they were still alive.</p><p>Lu Ming, Xu long, and the rest took a closer look.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming raised his eyebrows as if he had discovered something. There was a puzzled look in his eyes, but he remained silent and did not say anything.</p><p>Then, they carefully examined the three bodies. As expected, there were no wounds, not a single wound.</p><p>“No wound?”</p><p>Lu Ming furrowed his brows. He recalled the Emperor Cang’s subordinates in the Emperor secret realm. They died in the Emperor secret realm without any injuries.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that those people must have been killed by Shakyamuni annihilating soul. However, Lu Ming did not think that Shakyamuni annihilating soul had already escaped and came here to kill a low-level Martial Emperor every few days.</p><p>This was impossible!</p><p>“Dharma King annihilating soul? annihilate soul? That’s right, could it be that these few people’s souls were directly destroyed by someone and died?”</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly had an idea. He thought of this.</p><p>His eyes revealed a strange light. He felt that this matter was not simple.</p><p>After a thorough check, the Feng family buried the three Feng family heads and returned to the hall.</p><p>Xu long, Fu Xing, and the others frowned, but they did not find any clues either.</p><p>strange, there’s no wound at all. Could it be that the soul was directly destroyed? ”</p><p>Xu long said solemnly.</p><p>The others didn’t say anything. It was a very big deal.</p><p>“If the other party has a grudge against the Feng family and is here to seek revenge, then the next target is likely to be you, young master Feng!”</p><p>Fu Xing’s words made Feng Yi’s face turn even paler.</p><p>“What should we do? Esteemed envoys, please save me. Whatever you want, even if the Feng family has to go bankrupt, I will do my best to satisfy you!”</p><p>Feng Yi begged.</p><p>yes, don’t worry. Since I’ve accepted this mission, I’ll definitely complete it and ensure your safety!</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>“How about we take turns to protect young master Feng? Junior Brother Lu Ming and Junior Brother Zhang Kong will form a team, I will form a team with Fu Xing, and senior brother Xu long will form a team alone. What do you think?”</p><p>Duan Yan’s eyes turned as she spoke.</p><p>“I have no objections!”</p><p>Fu Xing smiled.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyebrows moved slightly. This grouping was interesting.</p><p>Among the five of them, he and Zhang Kong had the lowest cultivation, but they were placed together.</p><p>This didn’t make sense.</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth gradually curled into a smile.</p><p>The mission this time was very strange to begin with.</p><p>Among the five of them, Xu long, Fu Xing, and Duan Yan were all at the third level of the martial Royal realm, while he was only at the first level.</p><p>Such an arrangement was unreasonable to begin with.</p><p>Logically speaking, since there were third level martial emperors like Xu long, Fu Xing, and Duan Yan in the team, it meant that this mission could only be completed with a cultivation at the third level of the Martial Emperor realm. So, what was the meaning of putting him, a first level Martial Emperor, in there?</p><p>Could it be that someone was controlling this mission?</p><p>Or perhaps someone had deliberately arranged for Xu long, Fu Xing, and Duan Yan to come in?</p><p>Lu Ming thought of yinfeng and he Yu.</p><p>With Yin Feng’s status, it was still possible for him to deal with him in a mission.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
