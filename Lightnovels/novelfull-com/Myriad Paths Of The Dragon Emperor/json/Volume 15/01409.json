When they got close to the bubble, they became as small as dust and then disappeared into the bubble.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>...</p><p>Many people saw that it was fine to enter, so even more people rushed towards the bubble.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>A dense crowd of figures charged into the bubble and then disappeared inside.</p><p>“Let’s go too!”</p><p>Lu Ming said. Together with Qiu Ying Ying and the rest, they flew toward the bubble.</p><p>As soon as they flew towards the bubble, a strong force of attraction was produced on the bubble, pulling them in.</p><p>The closer they got to the bubble, they felt that the bubble was getting bigger.</p><p>Then, their figures also entered the bubble and disappeared.</p><p>On the platform, Yin Feng and a few other people looked at Lu Ming’s disappearing figure. Cold killing intent burst out from their bodies.</p><p>“Just you wait, I’ll definitely kill this person!”</p><p>The young man with the innate spirit body roared in anger.</p><p>although Lu Ming’s combat strength is strong now, when we reach the great emperor secret realm, we’ll break through to the martial Royal realm and our combat strength will increase greatly. Moreover, our innate spiritual bodies will also undergo a transformation. By then, we’ll let him die without a burial place!</p><p>Yin Feng gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>“That’s right. What’s the use of having a Supreme-level battle prowess? When he breaks through to the Emperor realm, I’ll make sure he dies an ugly death!”</p><p>The first person gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>Their cultivation had reached the limit of the Supreme-being realm, and they could start to break through to the martial Royal realm at any time.</p><p>Furthermore, their identities were not ordinary. They had powerful experts backing them. They had long been prepared to break through to the Martial Emperor realm. They were 100% confident that they could break through to the Dao Emperor realm.</p><p>Moreover, when an innate spirit body broke through to the Emperor level, it would also transform and reach the level of an inferior Earth Spirit body. Its combat strength would increase greatly and be much stronger than ordinary spirit bodies.</p><p>At that time, they had full confidence that they would make Lu Ming die an ugly death.</p><p>Then, the few of them also flew towards the bubble and disappeared.</p><p>As soon as Lu Ming flew into the bubble, he felt the world spinning. The next moment, he was high up in the sky.</p><p>He quickly circulated his true essence to stabilize his body.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Waves of ripples appeared in the sky.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the area and realized that there were many people in the void. There were more than a hundred people in his line of sight, but he did not see Qiu Ying Ying and the others.</p><p>It seemed that after entering this secret realm, they would appear at random.</p><p>In the void, more than a hundred people sized each other up.</p><p>There were people from all thirteen sects and powers among the hundred people.</p><p>it’s that kid from Dragon God Valley!</p><p>One of them looked at Lu Ming, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>This person was the young man with the flame mark between his eyebrows from the Tian Shen sect. His name was Liu Yan.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother liuyan, we’re so lucky!”</p><p>A figure appeared beside Liu Yan. It was Bing Kong.</p><p>haha, my luck is indeed good. Those guys still want to compete with me. After I kill this person, the Saint will definitely have a whole new level of respect for me!</p><p>Liu Yan was overjoyed. He took a step forward and walked toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Bing Kong followed!</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ming had also noticed Bing Kong and Liu Yan. He stood quietly in the void, his expression calm.</p><p>“Boy, you must be Lu Ming. You’re unlucky to have met me!”</p><p>Liu Yan sneered, his body exuding an ice-cold killing intent.</p><p>“You want to kill me? Is it because of him?”</p><p>Lu Ming said, his eyes fixed on the ice.</p><p>Lu Ming guessed that Bing Kong was trying to kill him.</p><p>After all, back in the continent of the divine Ruins, when the major sects of the yuan continent were selecting their disciples, Bing Kong had been badly beaten by him.</p><p>“Him? You’re wrong, it’s the Holy maiden who wants your life. Haha, no one can save you today!”</p><p>Liu Yan sneered, a powerful aura exuding from his body.</p><p>“Holy maiden?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned.</p><p>The Holy Virgin of the heavenly God sect wanted to kill him? However, he had just arrived and did not know any Holy Virgin of the heavenly God sect.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I bet you didn’t expect that Xie nianjun has become the Holy maiden of the deity sect. He’s been accepted as the personal disciple of the first elder of the deity sect!”</p><p>Bing Kong said.</p><p>“Xie nianjun, the Holy Virgin of the tianshen sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming was astonished. He had never expected that Xie nianjun would become the Holy maiden of the deity sect.</p><p>No wonder he didn’t see Xie nianjun among the disciples of the Tian Shen sect.</p><p>At the mention of Xie nianjun, Lu Ming could not help but think of Xie nianqing.</p><p>He didn’t see Xie nianqing among the disciples of the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Lu Ming was a little worried. He decided that after this matter was over, he would take some time to go to the Tian Yu demon sect and ask about the situation.</p><p>that’s right. Lu Ming, do you regret offending the saintess nianjun? ”</p><p>Bing Kong’s body exuded a cold aura.</p><p>“Regret? What’s there to regret? if she comes, I’ll step on her too!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>arrogant! You’re simply courting death!</p><p>Liu Yan’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“Senior brother liuyan, this person has a grudge with this little brother. Why don’t you let this little brother deal with him?”</p><p>Bing Kong said to Liu Yan.</p><p>“You want to steal my credit?”</p><p>Liu Yan’s face darkened.</p><p>“Senior brother, you’ve misunderstood. How dare I? As long as I cripple him, I’ll hand him over to Shixiong to deal with whether I kill him or not. The credit will naturally go to Shixiong.”</p><p>“I have a grudge against Lu Ming in the past. If I don’t take revenge, I won’t be able to calm my heart!”</p><p>Bing Kong hurriedly explained.</p><p>“Oh? So that’s how it is. Then, make your move!”</p><p>Liu Yan nodded, his hands behind his back as he stood by the side and watched.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>His combat sword was unsheathed and an icy long sword appeared in Bing Kong’s hand. The embryonic form of the ice domain spread out from his body and he charged towards Lu Ming.</p><p>“You think you’re my match?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>haha, Lu Ming, times are different now. You’re so ignorant. Two years ago, you actually stayed in the continent group of the divine Ruins. How can the cultivation environment of the continent group of the divine Ruins be compared to that of the primordial land? I came here two years earlier than you, and my cultivation has already reached the limit of the Supreme realm. How much progress can you make by staying in the continent group of the divine Ruins? ”</p><p>Bing Kong laughed coldly.</p><p>“Oh? Is this why you’re so confident? How lamentable!”</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head, and an aura emanated from his body.</p><p>The aura of a Supreme martial artist!</p><p>Bing Kong’s expression changed. He did not expect Lu Ming’s cultivation to have reached the Supreme-being level.</p><p>“It seems that you have made great progress in the few months you have been in the yuan continent!”</p><p>Bing Kong said.</p><p>He believed that Lu Ming had broken through to the Supreme-being realm in the few months that he had been in the yuan continent.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and could not be bothered to explain.</p><p>“But even if we’re both Supreme martial artists, you’re still no match for me. Ice jade technique, kill!”</p><p>The ice suddenly moved. He became one with the sword. A terrifying sword mark made of ice jade flew towards Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>so he cultivated a domain martial technique!</p><p>Lu Ming could tell at a glance that Bing Kong had cast a domain martial art technique.</p><p>No wonder Bing Kong was so confident!</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the icy air.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ming’s fist force passed, the sword Qi in the icy air instantly collapsed.</p><p>The fist force didn’t stop and continued to crush the ice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
