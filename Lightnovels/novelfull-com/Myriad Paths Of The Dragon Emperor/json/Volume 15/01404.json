I wanted to report to you as soon as I came back, but master has been in seclusion, so I waited until now to report!</p><p>Longyuan Shan said respectfully.</p><p>well, it’s really good to get a mixed energy token in such a remote place. He has endless potential. Only one person in Dragon God Valley has a mixed energy token!</p><p>The old man smiled warmly.</p><p>master, not only that, the bloodline that little guy awakened is the bloodline of the nine Dragons!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The old man’s brows rose in surprise.</p><p>master, that little guy is called Lu Ming. I’ve heard about him in the divine Ruins continent group. He’s a man who values relationships. He’s such a good man with a good character. Master, do you want to take him in as your disciple? ”</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>hehe, there’s no rush. It still depends on fate to acknowledge a master. It can’t be forced. Everything is up to fate!</p><p>The old man smiled.</p><p>“Yes, master!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan bowed.</p><p>“Yes, Yuanshan. You didn’t tell anyone about Lu Ming obtaining the mixed element token, did you?”</p><p>The old man asked.</p><p>no, only my master knows about it in Dragon God Valley! Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>well, then don’t tell anyone about it yet. His cultivation level is still low. If this gets out, he’ll be in trouble!</p><p>The old man instructed.</p><p>Longyuan Shan naturally nodded his head.</p><p>Longshan, you have to cultivate well too. Try to break through to the Saint realm. If you don’t enter the Saint realm, you won’t be able to achieve great things!</p><p>The old man’s tone changed.</p><p>thank you for your advice, master. I will work harder and break through to the Saint realm!</p><p>Longyuan Shan nodded.</p><p>“Mm, go!”</p><p>The old man waved his hand.</p><p>……</p><p>The following days were very peaceful. Yinfeng did not come to find trouble. Lu Ming was happy to be idle and cultivated in peace.</p><p>A few months passed by in a flash.</p><p>The day to enter the great Emperor’s Secret realm had arrived.</p><p>After a few months of cultivation, Lu Ming’s embryonic form of the chaos Domain had been cultivated to its limit two months ago.</p><p>During this period of time, he had been polishing his Foundation, allowing his cultivation to reach a state of perfect harmony.</p><p>As for the other heaven’s favorites, they had all made great progress.</p><p>Here, the cultivation environment was too good, and one’s cultivation progress was very fast. Most of the people had already stepped into the Supreme level.</p><p>Only a small number of them remained at the great circle of the spiritual God stage.</p><p>Thump! Thump! “BOOM!”</p><p>On this day, the summoning drum sounded again.</p><p>When they walked out of the cave, long Yuanchuan was waiting for them.</p><p>alright, the great Emperor’s Secret realm is about to open. Your test and your opportunity have arrived. Now, follow me!</p><p>After saying that, long Yuanchuan stepped into the air and left.</p><p>Everyone followed.</p><p>They flew out of the huge Valley and came to a huge square.</p><p>There were already many people waiting in the square.</p><p>There were more than a thousand people gathered together. At a glance, they were all young people, and most of them had the cultivation of Supreme martial artists.</p><p>they are the same as you. They are the disciples recruited by the Dragon God Valley from various continents. They will also enter the great emperor secret realm together!</p><p>Long Yuanchuan said as they landed on the square.</p><p>“So many people?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>At a glance, there were no less than ten thousand people.</p><p>Furthermore, people were still coming in.</p><p>These were the top talents of the continents. Dragon God Valley had recruited so many people.</p><p>However, when Lu Ming thought of the map of the entire primordial realm, he felt at ease.</p><p>Outside the yuan continent, in the vast ocean, there were too many continents like the divine wilderness continent.</p><p>Recruiting tens of thousands of top heaven’s favorites is nothing. It’s just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>People kept flying over.</p><p>In the end, there were about 20000 people.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>Suddenly, a large number of figures flew over from the vast Snow Mountain.</p><p>There were a few thousand of them, and they were all young men. Furthermore, they were all Supreme martial artists.</p><p>However, these people did not land together with Lu Ming and the rest. Instead, they landed above the square.</p><p>As soon as they landed, they looked at Lu Ming and the rest with all kinds of eyes.</p><p>Some were curious, some were disdainful, some were cold, and some were disdainful …</p><p>There were all kinds of gazes.</p><p>“Yinfeng!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze swept across the crowd and he saw Yin Feng.</p><p>Lu Ming finally understood. The thousands of people who came out later were the local talents of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Yin Feng, I heard that a few months ago, you were defeated by a country bumpkin from a Savage Island. He even stepped on your face nine times. Is that true? ”</p><p>A red-robed young man walked towards Yin Feng and asked with a cold smile.</p><p>“Hmph, Chi ke, I don’t need you to care about my matters!”</p><p>Yin Feng said with a cold face.</p><p>“Don’t need me to care? Hahaha, Yin Feng, you’re really a piece of trash. You can’t even defeat a country bumpkin from a Savage Island and got stomped on nine times in a row. How embarrassing!”</p><p>besides, it’s fine if you’re embarrassing yourself, but you’re embarrassing the people of Dragon God Valley as well. Why don’t I care? ”</p><p>The red-robed youth Chi ke mocked.</p><p>On the side, the others also revealed mocking smiles.</p><p>“Detestable!”</p><p>Yin Feng gritted his teeth, and his face revealed a ferocious killing intent.</p><p>It was all that Lu Ming’s fault, that country bumpkin.</p><p>If it wasn’t for him, how would he be ridiculed by Chi ke?</p><p>In the past few months, he had been ridiculed a lot.</p><p>He could not wait to tear Lu Ming into a thousand pieces.</p><p>“That bastard, I must kill him!”</p><p>Yin Feng roared in his heart. His gaze swept through the crowd and landed on Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming seemed to sense Yin Feng’s gaze and looked back at him, revealing a disdainful smile.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, an old man suddenly appeared in the sky above the square.</p><p>Lu Ming did not know how the elder appeared.</p><p>It was as if he had been standing there before.</p><p>The old man had a tall and sturdy figure, and his long beard fluttered in the wind. However, he looked very ordinary, just like an ordinary person.</p><p>However, he casually stood in the air and attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>It was as if the old man was the entire world.</p><p>“This aura …”</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils contracted sharply. This elder’s temperament gave him a very familiar feeling.</p><p>He thought of the profound sky Saint!</p><p>The temperament of the two was very similar!</p><p>A Saint!</p><p>Lu Ming was certain that this was a martial Saint.</p><p>A martial Saint. This was the first time Lu Ming had seen a living martial Saint. He could not help but release his spiritual sense. However, the next moment, his body trembled and he quickly retracted his spiritual sense.</p><p>When he used his spiritual sense to scan, he seemed to see a world appearing in front of him. A terrifying pressure was acting on his heart. If he didn’t withdraw his spiritual sense quickly and the other party didn’t have any hostility, his soul spirit would have been injured just now.</p><p>He was too strong!</p><p>“Is this the power of a Sage? I’m afraid that if you want to kill me, you can kill me with just a breath, right?”</p><p>Lu Ming sighed in his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
