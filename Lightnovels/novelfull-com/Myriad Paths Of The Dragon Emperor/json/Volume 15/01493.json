He carefully read through the cultivation insights left behind by the cloud Dragon Valley master, which gave Lu Ming a lot of inspiration.</p><p>After that, Lu Ming returned to the cave abode.</p><p>...</p><p>A piece of heavenly Dao stone floated above Lu Ming’s head. He was immersed in a Deep State of enlightenment.</p><p>The heavenly Dao stone would slowly become smaller and smaller as the martial artist comprehended it, and finally disappear.</p><p>After a few days, when a heavenly Dao stone had disappeared, Lu Ming changed to another heavenly Dao stone.</p><p>Lu Ming was immersed in cultivation.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ming did not blindly comprehend the chaos realm.</p><p>Every day, he would spend time cultivating the godly sword technique.</p><p>The divine sword technique could strengthen one’s soul and increase the power of soul attacks. Lu Ming would not miss out on this secret skill. It would be of great help to him if he cultivated it to a high level.</p><p>In addition, Lu Ming did not forget about the thirteen accumulated power strikes and the chaos sky-turning seal. He would cultivate them every day.</p><p>Time flew by, and three months passed in a flash.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ming stopped cultivating.</p><p>the chaos Domain is indeed very difficult to cultivate. It’s too slow to improve!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>After three months of non-stop cultivation using the heavenly Dao stone, his Primal Chaos Domain had not even reached the peak of the third-grade, much less the fourth-grade.</p><p>One should know that this was aided by the heavenly Dao stone. The heavenly Dao stone was so precious that even sage realm experts would yearn for it. Other martial emperors and martial artists could not have a treasure like the heavenly Dao stone to assist in their cultivation at all, unless they were the top geniuses of a certain sect.</p><p>However, they could also be like Lu Ming, using the heavenly Dao stone to cultivate all the time.</p><p>In three months, he had used up nearly thirty heavenly Dao stones, but his Chaos Domain had yet to reach the peak of the third level. It was clear how difficult it was to cultivate the chaos Domain.</p><p>As the level of the chaos Domain increased, the difficulty of cultivation would also increase.</p><p>Previously, he had been able to improve so quickly because he had refined three Royal fruits and watched the battle between the Titan devouring bull and the three-eyed creature. Now that he was cultivating normally, his progress was slower.</p><p>Other than the chaos realm, he had made rapid progress in other areas.</p><p>Lu Ming had cultivated the thirteen accumulated power strikes to the fifth level. When he struck out with the spear, there were ten layers of explosive power. The power was shocking and it had become Lu Ming’s strongest attack besides the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>It was even stronger than when he used the prison suppressing heavenly art.</p><p>It also changed Lu Ming’s attack methods.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal had also improved. It had been cultivated to the third level. Other than being more powerful, Lu Ming was also more comfortable with using it.</p><p>The godly sword technique was also progressing very quickly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s soul had been condensed by the world refinement Bell of tribulation and was dozens of times stronger than ordinary people. It was very suitable for him to cultivate the soul attack technique.</p><p>After this period of cultivation, not only did Lu Ming’s soul force become stronger, but the attack power of the divine sword technique was also rapidly increasing. Its power was shocking.</p><p>Lu du was very satisfied with the improvements in these aspects. It was just that the improvement of the chaos Domain was too slow.</p><p>I can’t cultivate like this. I have to speed up my cultivation. I heard that the sacred cultivation ground in Dragon God Valley, the sky-connecting floating platform, can help people comprehend the heavenly Dao and cultivate their domain. Let’s go and have a look!</p><p>Lu Ming ended his cultivation and planned to make a trip to the sky-connecting floating platform.</p><p>For a big sect like Dragon God Valley, there were many wonderful places that could help people cultivate.</p><p>The sky-reaching floating platform was such a Holy Land for cultivation. It was extremely famous in Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The disciples of Dragon God Valley only needed to pay the raw stones to enter.</p><p>Lu Ming left the cloud Dragon Valley and flew towards the depths of the snow Mountain.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming landed in front of a Canyon.</p><p>The sky-connecting floating platform was in the middle of a few big snow mountains. Two of the snow mountains formed a Canyon Passage. If one wanted to enter the sky-connecting floating platform, they had to go through this passage.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Just as Lu Ming was about to enter the passageway, he was blocked by a few young men.</p><p>“What is the meaning of this?”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned slightly and asked.</p><p>As far as he knew, the passage in front of the sky-connecting floating platform was unguarded. Only after entering the passage would there be people guarding and paying raw stones.</p><p>the sky-reaching floating platform has been reserved by people from my Silver Dragon Valley and blood Dragon Valley. You can come back after a while!</p><p>One of the young men sneered.</p><p>“Reserved by Silver Dragon Valley and blood Dragon Valley? The sky-reaching floating platform is the cultivation Holy Land of the Dragon God Valley. It is open to all disciples of the Seven Valleys of the Dragon God Valley. I have never heard that it belongs to any of the Dragon valleys. Move!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? If I say it’s all reserved, then it’s all reserved!”</p><p>A young man blocked Lu Ming’s way and said.</p><p>“You know me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>The few young men had cold expressions on their faces as they sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this moment, two young men appeared. They were wearing long white robes with an Ice Dragon embroidered on it.</p><p>They were the disciples of Ice Dragon Valley.</p><p>The two Ice Dragon Valley disciples didn’t have anyone to stop them. They directly entered the passage and disappeared.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said,”didn’t you say that the sky-reaching floating platform has been reserved by the silver Dragon Valley and the blood Dragon Valley?” How can the people of Ice Dragon Valley enter?”</p><p>A few young men blocked Lu Ming’s way. They had mocking smiles in their eyes but did not say a word.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>The other party was probably deliberately making things difficult for him.</p><p>Judging from their clothes, these people were obviously disciples of Silver Dragon Valley. He had killed Yin Feng in front of the master of Silver Dragon Valley, which made him an enemy of Silver Dragon Valley.</p><p>However, he had never seen these people before, but they could recognize him at a glance. Lu Ming could not help but think of many things.</p><p>Could it be that the master of Silver Dragon Valley was controlling the situation and had sent someone to guard the place so that Lu Ming could not enter the sky-connecting floating platform to cultivate?</p><p>At the thought of this, a sharp glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. He then took a step forward.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The three silver Dragon Valley young men burst out with a powerful aura. All of them were at the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p><p>“Stop right there!”</p><p>One of the young men shouted coldly and three waves of pressure pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, a few more people came over. Seeing this situation, they couldn’t help but stop to watch.</p><p>“That’s Lu Ming. Those people are disciples of Silver Dragon Valley!”</p><p>“This is going to be a good show. A few months ago, Lu Ming killed Yin Feng in front of the master of Silver Dragon Valley, which infuriated him. I heard that after the master returned to Silver Dragon Valley, he gathered all the young disciples of Silver Dragon Valley and sent out a message to ask them to ‘take good care’ of Lu Ming when they meet him outside!”</p><p>The few people who were watching were discussing in low voices. Although their voices were soft, Lu Ming could still hear them clearly.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze turned colder.</p><p>The master of Silver Dragon Valley was the master of a Valley. His grandson had committed heinous crimes. Not only was he not disciplined, but he had also tried to slander Lu Ming and was killed by him.</p><p>Now, he actually incited a disciple of Silver Dragon Valley to deal with Lu Ming behind his back. He was despicable, shameless, and extremely shameless.</p><p>He was afraid of the master of Cloud Dragon Valley and didn’t dare to make a move, but he let the younger generation of Silver Dragon Valley do it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
