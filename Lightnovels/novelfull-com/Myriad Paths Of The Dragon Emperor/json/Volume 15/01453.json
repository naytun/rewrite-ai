Lu Ming refined the shield and the spiritual God defensive armor at the same time.</p><p>The shield flew into Lu Ming’s glabella and disappeared, floating in his sea of consciousness.</p><p>...</p><p>As for the spiritual God defensive armor, it entered his dantian and covered the entire body of the spiritual God. The spiritual God was wearing a Jade armor.</p><p>After refining the treasures, Lu Ming took out three Royal fruits. He planned to refine them to improve his cultivation.</p><p>A low-level martial Royal could increase one’s cultivation by one level after refining one Royal fruit. It was extremely precious.</p><p>However, Lu Ming cultivated the chaos realm and he was not confident.</p><p>He opened his mouth and swallowed the Royal fruit. Then, he began to refine it.</p><p>A day later, when the effects of the Royal fruit had been fully refined, Lu Ming shook his head and smiled bitterly. As expected, it was impossible for others to advance one level after refining the Royal fruit. His cultivation was still at the LV 1 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Continue!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took out another Royal fruit and began to refine it.</p><p>Two days passed by in a flash. Lu Ming had refined all three Royal fruits. However, his cultivation had only reached the peak of the first level martial Royal realm. He had not even broken through to the second level.</p><p>it’s indeed difficult to improve the chaotic domain. Three royal domain fruits can only help me reach the peak of Lv 1 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming gave a bitter smile.</p><p>However, it was not bad to be able to reach the peak of the first level Martial Emperor realm. Once the opportunity came, Lu Ming could break through to the second level Martial Emperor realm at any time.</p><p>now that I’ve reached the martial Royal realm, it’s time for me to practice a domain martial technique!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>After his trip to the great emperor secret realm, he realized that his current attack methods were too simple.</p><p>Most of the time, he relied on the prison suppressing heavenly art and the primal Chaos Domain to suppress them.</p><p>With the help of the prison suppressing stele’s bloodline, the prison suppressing heavenly art was extremely powerful. At the Martial Emperor realm, it was enough to unleash a terrifying power.</p><p>However, it was too one-dimensional for just one technique.</p><p>As for the chaos sky-turning seal, although it was extremely powerful, it also consumed a great deal of energy. It could be used as a trump card and could not be used normally.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming needed to cultivate an offensive domain martial art technique.</p><p>As for movement techniques, he didn’t need them for the time being.</p><p>First, although the wind elemental technique was only a martial technique of creation, it was enough for the time being with the help of the air-frozen bead and the black wings.</p><p>Secondly, although the nine Dragons heaven-treading steps was not a domain-level martial art technique, Lu Ming’s power was still shocking after he had cultivated the ninth step. It was especially so when it was combined with the Dragon God combat body. Its power could be further enhanced.</p><p>Thus, he didn’t need to cultivate movement techniques for the time being.</p><p>It was mainly an attack-type skill. Moreover, Lu Ming wanted to cultivate a skill that could unleash the power of a spirit weapon or even a holy weapon.</p><p>When Lu Ming used the prison destructive Divine Art, he would usually use his physical body to fight his opponent. Even if he had an Emperor spiritual weapon or a holy weapon, it would be useless. For example, if his opponent was a swordsman who was holding a holy weapon and fighting him, he would be at a disadvantage if his opponent had the power of a holy weapon while he did not.</p><p>“Which domain martial skill should I practice?”</p><p>Lu Ming was deep in thought.</p><p>The nine Dragons ‘memory fragments contained many domain martial techniques.</p><p>Apart from some very special domains that could not be transformed, the primal Chaos Domain could be transformed into any other domain. For example, the domain of spear, the domain of sword …</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ming could cultivate all these types of domain-level martial arts techniques.</p><p>“Thirteen charged attacks!”</p><p>After a long while, Lu Ming chose a martial arts technique.</p><p>[ storing power thirteen strikes ] was a spear art!</p><p>When Lu Ming’s cultivation level was still low, he had always been using a spear. Therefore, he still had a special liking for Spears.</p><p>However, after his cultivation level increased, he did not have a suitable execution. Moreover, the prison suppressing heaven technique was very powerful. Therefore, Lu Ming gradually stopped using the execution.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming was quite satisfied with the power of the thirteen accumulated strikes.</p><p>Thirteen charged attacks, with the spear domain as the foundation, using the spear, the attacks were like a storm, one after another.</p><p>When trained to the highest level, the spear could unleash thirteen bursts of power in a row, and its destructive power was shocking.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The next moment, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hands.</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear!</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The infinite Dragon Spear shook and let out a loud buzzing sound.</p><p>Lu Ming shook his head and sighed. no way. Infinite Dragon Spear. My level is not high enough!</p><p>Although he had refined the infinite Dragon Spear in the past and made it a ninth-level spiritual weapon, given Lu Ming’s current cultivation, an ordinary ninth-level spiritual weapon would not be able to unleash Lu Ming’s power. On the contrary, it would shatter due to the excessive force.</p><p>“I’ll wait for my second body to fully recover and then slowly refine and improve it!”</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself and put away the infinite Dragon Spear. Then, another spear appeared in his hands.</p><p>This was an Emperor spiritual weapon that Lu Ming had obtained in the Emperor’s secret realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The long spear shook and buzzed. Lu Ming was very satisfied.</p><p>if I have the chance, I must get a Saint weapon spear and a pair of Saint weapon gloves!</p><p>Lu Ming thought to himself.</p><p>With the Saint weapon grade gloves, he wouldn’t be at a disadvantage when using the prison suppressing heavenly art against his enemies.</p><p>Immediately, Lu Ming carefully comprehended the profoundness of the thirteen charged strikes.</p><p>However, Lu Ming soon received a voice transmission from Longyuan mountain. Longyuan mountain was looking for him.</p><p>When he opened the door, he saw Longyuan mountain standing outside the door.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, master is looking for you!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had been in seclusion for seven days. It was time for the cloud Dragon Valley master to look for him.</p><p>Lu Ming followed Longyuan mountain and walked towards the depths of Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived at the end of Cloud Dragon Valley. There was a cave residence there. After entering the cave residence, they saw the cloud Dragon Valley master sitting cross-legged on an ice platform.</p><p>“Master, ninth Junior Brother has arrived. I’ll take my leave!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan bowed and left.</p><p>“Disciple greets master!”</p><p>Lu Ming, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley, bowed.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>The valley master smiled and nodded. He sized Lu Ming up and smiled. not bad, your cultivation has reached the peak of the LV 1 martial Royal realm. You have a strong foundation and will soon break through to the LV 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>Lu Ming did not make a sound. He just listened quietly.</p><p>“Ming ‘er, show me your domain!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. Without any hesitation, he released his Chaos Domain.</p><p>There was nothing to hide about the chaos Domain. Once he encountered a strong enemy, he would use it. Those with good eyesight would naturally be able to recognize it.</p><p>As expected, the chaos Domain spread out. The cloud Dragon Valley master’s eyes widened as he exclaimed, ” Chaos Domain!</p><p>Clearly, the cloud Dragon Valley master was also extremely shocked.</p><p>After a long while, the cloud Dragon Valley master regained his calm and frowned in thought.</p><p>After more than ten minutes, the cloud Dragon Valley master spoke again, ” “Ming ‘er, I didn’t expect you to be so talented that you could actually cultivate the legendary Chaos Domain!”</p><p>the chaos realm is a legendary realm, the Emperor of thousands of realms. This is the first time I’ve seen someone successfully cultivate it, so I’m afraid I have nothing to teach you!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
