He took such a long time to get to the first floating platform and he still dares to bet with the senior brother from the silver Blizzard city. He’s basically giving away his contribution points to the senior brother!</p><p>500000 contribution points! I’m so envious! The senior brother of the silver Blizzard city has just earned a huge sum of money!</p><p>Below, some people looked at Lu Ming and sneered.</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly. He could not be bothered.</p><p>He had made a bet with the silver-robed young man on who would be able to reach the higher floating platform, not on who would take the shorter time.</p><p>It was his first time here, and he had spent a lot of time refining the heavenly Dao marks.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming took a step forward and stepped onto the second floating platform. He then sat down cross-legged and the second floating platform glowed. The inscriptions enveloped Lu Ming again and he was back in the vast land of chaos in the next moment.</p><p>Roar! “Roar!”</p><p>Just like the last time, beasts of the heavenly path began to form, but this time, they all had two golden marks of the heavenly path between their brows.</p><p>The two golden marks indicated that the heavenly path mutant beast here had the power of a second-grade domain.</p><p>The heavenly path mutant beasts roared and pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>The chaos realm condensed a long spear once again. Lu Ming held the long spear and rushed forward.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The spear radiance swept across and killed the beasts one after another.</p><p>Not long after, all 108 mutated beasts were killed by Lu Ming. He reappeared on the sky-connecting floating platform.</p><p>With a glance, he saw that the silver-robed youth was already on the third floating platform.</p><p>Lu Ming ignored him and closed his eyes to refine the heavenly Dao mark.</p><p>The second floating platform had double the number of heavenly Dao marks compared to the first floating platform.</p><p>An hour later, after Lu Ming had refined all the heavenly Dao marks, he felt that the chaos realm had improved again.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared on the third floating platform.</p><p>On the third floating platform, after entering the vast land of chaos, the heavenly way strange beasts that appeared had three golden marks between their brows. They were equivalent to third-level territory and were on par with Lu Ming’s territory.</p><p>However, Lu Ming’s territory was the chaos Territory. It was the king of thousands of territories. There were very few in the world that could be compared with the chaos Territory.</p><p>Although they were at the same level, he would definitely crush them.</p><p>Not long after, the 108 beasts of the heavenly path were killed. Lu Ming began to refine the mark of the heavenly path.</p><p>Below, some people continued to discuss.</p><p>this Lu Ming is quite talented. He can fight above his level. I estimate that he can make it to the fourth floating platform, but it’s definitely his limit!</p><p>not bad. The third floating platform has 108 beasts of the heavenly way that are equivalent to fourth-level domain beasts. Lu Ming would be considered pretty good if he could kill ten of them.</p><p>brother Blizzard Silver city’s domain has already broken through to the sixth level. Last time, he killed fifty heavenly path beasts on the sixth platform. There’s no suspense in this bet!</p><p>A few of the young men from the silver Blizzard city said.</p><p>look! The silver Blizzard city’s senior brother is about to step onto the fifth floating platform!</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>As expected, Blizzard Silver City stood up and took a step forward, appearing on the fifth floating platform. He turned to look at Lu Ming, who was still on the third floating platform, and a cold smile appeared on his face. Then, he sat down cross-legged.</p><p>This time, it took a full two hours before Lu Ming refined the heavenly Dao mark. He felt that the chaos Domain was approaching the peak of the third-level domain.</p><p>Lu Ming stood up and took a step forward. He stepped onto the fourth floating platform and sat cross-legged.</p><p>this kid is on the fourth floating platform. Just watch. In less than half a minute, he’ll be blasted off the floating platform!</p><p>One of the blizzard Silver city’s friends said in disdain.</p><p>Very quickly, half a minute had passed. Lu Ming’s figure was as steady as a rock.</p><p>Hmph, even if you hold on a little longer, you’ll just be struggling on your last breath. In three minutes at most, you’ll be blasted down!</p><p>The young man who had spoken earlier blushed and said awkwardly.</p><p>Very quickly, three minutes had passed. Lu Ming’s figure was still as steady as a rock.</p><p>“He definitely won’t last ten minutes!”</p><p>The young man said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Lu Ming’s body glowed with a golden light. It was obvious that he had killed all the beasts of the heavenly path and was beginning to refine the heavenly path mark.</p><p>so fast! He killed all the exotic beasts on the fourth floating platform in ten minutes!</p><p>it’s really fast. It took 15 minutes in the Silver City!</p><p>who was the one who kept saying that Lu Ming would be blasted down just now?!</p><p>The other young men were discussing among themselves. They were extremely surprised, and some of them even looked at the young man who had spoken earlier.</p><p>The young man’s face turned into the color of a pig’s liver, and he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Hmph, I was just lucky enough to pass the fourth floating platform. I definitely can’t pass the fifth!</p><p>The young man said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Everyone watched as time slowly passed.</p><p>After a while, Silver City on the fifth platform suddenly stood up.</p><p>“That brat should have been blasted down!”</p><p>A sneer appeared on Blizzard Silver’s face as he looked behind him.</p><p>With one look, his expression changed.</p><p>“You actually passed the fourth floating platform. Hmph, consider yourself lucky. However, the fifth floating platform is your limit!”</p><p>Blizzard silver snorted and stepped onto the sixth floating platform. He entered the battlefield of the heavenly law and fought with the beast of the heavenly law.</p><p>Below the sky-connecting floating platform, the crowd watched quietly.</p><p>After about 20 minutes, Blizzard silver, who was sitting cross-legged on the sixth floating platform, suddenly trembled. With a flash of inscription light, Blizzard Silver’s body flew out of the floating platform and landed at the bottom.</p><p>senior Blizzard Silver City, how many level six heavenly path mutant beasts did you kill this time? ”</p><p>The young man who had been saying that Lu Ming was going to be blasted down quickly asked.</p><p>“Sixty-eight!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City said.</p><p>“Sixty-eight, eighteen more than last time. Congratulations, senior brother, it won’t be long before you can pass the sixth floating platform!”</p><p>The young man quickly flattered.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Blizzard Silver City smiled faintly and revealed a look of satisfaction. He then looked at Lu Ming who was on the fourth floating platform.</p><p>However, at this moment, Lu Ming stood up and stepped onto the fifth floating platform. He sat cross-legged and immediately started to engrave inscriptions.</p><p>Hmph, third rank territory. To be able to step onto the fifth floating platform is his limit!</p><p>Blizzard Silver City said coldly.</p><p>that’s right. He won’t be able to kill ten level-five beasts of the heavenly path before he’s blasted down!</p><p>The young man from before said.</p><p>However, time passed. One minute, two minutes, five minutes had passed. Lu Ming was still sitting cross-legged on the floating platform. The young man had completely shut up. Blizzard Silver city’s face had also turned cold.</p><p>Lu Ming was engaged in a great battle on the heaven Dao battlefield.</p><p>On the fifth platform of the heavenly path battlefield, the heavenly path strange beast that had been condensed was equivalent to a level-five domain.</p><p>The heavenly way mutant beast with a level five domain was extremely powerful. It pounced everywhere with shocking power.</p><p>However, the chaos Domain could still suppress these exotic beasts.</p><p>Back in the Tian Yu demonic sect, Lu Ming had used his level two chaos realm to fight against Jin Yu’s level five demonic feather realm. He had defeated Jin Yu’s realm in one fell swoop, which showed the power of the chaos realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
