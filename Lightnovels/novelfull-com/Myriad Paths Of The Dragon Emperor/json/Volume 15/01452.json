In the blink of an eye, he had disappeared without a trace. This made Lu Ming speechless.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, master is always like this. He has a casual personality, but he is extremely good to his disciples!</p><p>...</p><p>Long Yuanchuan smiled at Lu Ming and explained.</p><p>second senior brother, I heard that our Cloud Dragon Valley only has a hundred disciples. Is that true? ”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>that’s right. Cloud Dragon Valley, including master, has a total of more than 120 people. The other valleys have disciples, deacons, and elders. But in our Cloud Dragon Valley, there are no elders. The only senior figure is master and his nine core disciples. The rest are all ordinary disciples!</p><p>Long Yuanchuan said.</p><p>“No elders? Master is the only one of the older generation?”</p><p>Lu Ming was even more curious.</p><p>yes, because in the past, Dragon God Valley only had six valleys, and each of them had a long history. There was no cloud Dragon Valley. Cloud Dragon Valley was founded by master!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“It was founded by my master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. He was very curious about this cheap master that he had just acknowledged.</p><p>Lu Ming knew how difficult it was to create a Valley in a big sect like Dragon God Valley. It was equivalent to being independent. He was afraid that countless people would object. However, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley was able to do it. It was definitely not simple.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, let’s go. I’ll take you to your place!” He said.</p><p>Longyuan mountain said before stepping forward.</p><p>Lu Ming followed.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley was huge and wide, but there were only a hundred people inside. It was obvious how few people there were. After flying for a long time, they only met two young men.</p><p>“Greetings, senior brother!”</p><p>When the two young men saw Longyuan mountain, they bowed.</p><p>you’re welcome. Let me introduce you to master’s new direct disciple!</p><p>Longyuan Shan pointed at Lu Ming and introduced.</p><p>“Valley master’s new disciple?”</p><p>The two young men looked at Lu Ming curiously, then bowed and said, ” “Greetings, senior brother!”</p><p>“Ah? Senior brother?”</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, they’re just ordinary disciples of Cloud Dragon Valley. They call us Core disciples and senior brothers!</p><p>Longyuan mountain sent a voice transmission to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. So that was the case.</p><p>“The two of you don’t need to be so polite!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>“You guys can go!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan waved his hand and continued to lead Lu Ming deeper into the canyon.</p><p>The deeper he went, the thicker the heaven Earth Yuan Qi became.</p><p>“Of master’s nine disciples, other than you and me, some are in closed door cultivation, some are cultivating outside, and some are on missions. If there’s a chance in the future, I’ll introduce them to you one by one!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain explained the situation of Cloud Dragon Valley as they walked.</p><p>Soon, they arrived in front of a huge ice cave. The door of this ice cave was tightly shut.</p><p>Junior Brother, this immortal’s cave is yours from now on. There’s a formation at the entrance. I’ll teach you how to control it!</p><p>Longyuan Shan took out a jade talisman and passed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>“Thank you, second senior!”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists.</p><p>ninth Junior Brother, you should get to know him. I think master will summon you in a few days!</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed and then left.</p><p>Lu Ming picked up the Jade talisman and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He memorized the method in the Jade talisman.</p><p>There was a simple formation at the entrance that could be controlled with only true essence.</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward, his quintessential essence suffused. The door of the ice cave opened with a crack.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in.</p><p>Then, he controlled the formation and closed the door.</p><p>Lu Ming carefully sized up the cave abode.</p><p>The cave abode was huge. It had an ice bed, an ICE table, an ice chair, and everything. Lu Ming took a closer look and realized that something was not right. This was not ordinary ice, but ice jade. It was crystal clear and emitted a slight chill. Cultivating here would help in tempering one’s spirit body.</p><p>In addition, there was more than one bedroom in the ice cave. There were other ice rooms that were connected by passages. Lu Ming walked around and found that there were more than a dozen ice rooms. There was actually spring water flowing out of one of the ice rooms, but it did not freeze.</p><p>Lu Ming was very satisfied with the cave abode.</p><p>The origin Qi of heaven and earth here was several times denser than that in the outer Valley.</p><p>“Let’s check our harvest first!”</p><p>Lu Ming sat cross-legged on the ice jade bed. With a wave of his hand, he took out all the storage rings he had obtained this time.</p><p>On the way back, Lu Ming just casually counted.</p><p>He sorted out the mid-grade raw gemstones, spiritual herbs, spiritual weapons, and so on.</p><p>As for the spiritual herbs, Lu Ming kept all of them into the mountain and river diagram for dandan and Paopao to eat.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ming kept the most valuable items in a storage ring.</p><p>Lu Ming had gained a lot from this trip to the great emperor secret realm.</p><p>Not to mention some spiritual herbs and blacksmithing materials.</p><p>The divine medicine was a heavenly liquid ancient tree.</p><p>The heavenly Dao stone, over two hundred pieces.</p><p>Lu Ming took out two Saint weapons to exchange for contribution points. He had three more, the black wings, the shield given to him by Qiu Hao, and a jade bangle for Xie nianqing.</p><p>In addition, three Royal fruits and one Saint breakthrough pill.</p><p>Most importantly, Emperor Cang had given him a storage ring. This was the great Emperor’s storage ring. The thought of it made Lu Ming’s heart race.</p><p>However, it was a pity that his lightning cauldron was an absolute Saint weapon.</p><p>In Emperor Cang’s bedroom, Emperor Cang seemed to have suppressed Shakyamuni annihilating soul with the help of the Thunder cauldron. However, it was obvious that Shakyamuni annihilating soul had recovered more than Emperor Cang. The two of them entered the depths of the void. The outcome of this battle was still unknown. Perhaps, Emperor Cang would never appear again. Therefore, Lu Ming’s Thunder cauldron would most likely not be returned.</p><p>Fortunately, with Emperor Cang’s storage ring as compensation, Lu Ming felt more at ease.</p><p>“Open it and see what’s inside Emperor Cang’s storage ring? Are there any monarch weapons? Emperor pill?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. He picked up the storage ring and channeled his essential core into it.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Lu Ming was stunned. He could not open it!</p><p>“Continue!”</p><p>He gritted his teeth and continued to increase his true Qi, but he still couldn’t open it.</p><p>“I’ll continue, continue …”</p><p>Lu Ming gave up after a while.</p><p>this is a scam! There’s Emperor Cang’s seal on this storage ring. With my cultivation level, I can’t break this seal at all!</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to look up and roar.</p><p>He was so depressed that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>He couldn’t eat the fat meat that was in his mouth.</p><p>This reminded Lu Ming of the king’s storage ring that he had obtained not long after he started cultivating. He could not open it as he was not powerful enough.</p><p>The situation was similar, but this time, Lu Ming was even more depressed. This was the great Emperor’s storage ring, which he had exchanged for with the Thunder cauldron.</p><p>Lu Ming was indignant. He tried a few more times but had no choice but to give up.</p><p>His cultivation wasn’t high enough to break through Emperor Cang’s imprint. If he wanted to break through slowly, he had to be in the Saint realm.</p><p>Lu Ming despised Emperor Cang for a long time. Since he gave him the storage ring, why didn’t he rub off the brand on it?</p><p>Lu Ming had no choice but to keep Emperor Cang’s storage ring.</p><p>Then, with a flash, black wings appeared on his back.</p><p>Lu Ming was prepared to refine the black wings again.</p><p>In the future, Lu Ming would need to refine the black wings more often. This way, the power of the Holy weapon could be slowly unleashed.</p><p>A day later, Lu Ming refined the black wings again and put them away.</p><p>Then, he took out the shield and started to refine it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
