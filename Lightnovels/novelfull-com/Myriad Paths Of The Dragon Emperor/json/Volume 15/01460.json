It’s impossible!”</p><p>The one who spoke was not the Feng family head, but Feng Yi.</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing also looked puzzled. They opened the coffins and examined them carefully, but found nothing. There were no wounds on the three people, so they could not find any clues.</p><p>“What’s the flaw? Lu Ming, you’d better not talk nonsense!”</p><p>Duan Yan sneered.</p><p>“Shut up. If you’re stupid, then listen to me!”</p><p>Lu Ming cast a cold glance at Duan Yan and berated her.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Duan Yan’s beautiful face was flushed red. Lu Ming actually called her stupid.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll listen to Junior Brother Lu Ming!”</p><p>Xu long tried to smooth things over.</p><p>according to my deduction, the three people who died in the Feng family, the second master and the third master, were all killed. Moreover, the one who killed them was you, right, Feng family head? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>The Feng family head smiled coldly and did not answer directly.</p><p>but they were your family after all. You felt guilty for killing them and using them for your scheme. So, when you buried them, you dressed them up carefully. So, after they were buried, they were neatly and meticulously dressed!</p><p>however, although the body of the Feng family’s head seemed to be neatly dressed, it was not meticulous. Some parts seemed to be casual, which explains a lot of problems.</p><p>“If that person was really the Feng family head, then why didn’t he bury him meticulously like the second master and third master? That’s impossible. It can only mean that the Feng family head is a fake. That’s why Feng Yi wasn’t as careful when he was buried!”</p><p>Lu Ming explained slowly.</p><p>“You … You …”</p><p>Feng Yi’s eyes widened.</p><p>Lu Ming said that in his heart. In fact, this was indeed the case.</p><p>Master Feng’s eyes also revealed a look of surprise. at such a young age, your observation skills are so meticulous. It’s really admirable. Even I didn’t expect this!</p><p>“This fellow …”</p><p>On the side, Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing had to admit that they had not thought of this either.</p><p>there’s one more thing. Three days ago, a black shadow lured Zhang Kong and I out. I guess you wanted to take us down one by one, but you’re too familiar with the terrain of the liukong mountain. After you attacked Zhang Kong, you disappeared in a few breaths. I guess there must be a secret passage or something nearby.</p><p>this makes me wonder if this person is from the Feng family. Otherwise, how could he be so familiar with the nearby area? ”</p><p>the third point is what happened just now. We clearly set up a formation in Feng Yi’s bedroom, but you were able to easily take Feng Yi away from the formation. It’s obvious that Feng Yi is in cahoots with you. He’s in cahoots with you!</p><p>“Then your identity is obvious. Who else could it be other than the Feng family head? You’ve been planning this step by step to lure us here, or rather, you’ve only wanted to kill us. But I’m very curious, why do you want to kill us? We are disciples of Dragon God Valley.”</p><p>Lu Ming explained in detail and then asked his question.</p><p>“You want to kill us? The Feng family is really bold. In my opinion, the Feng family should cease to exist in the future!”</p><p>Duan Yan said coldly.</p><p>“Hahaha, what can you do even if you know? So what if he didn’t step into the formation? Today, you will all die!”</p><p>The Feng family head laughed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura rose from the Feng family head.</p><p>The aura of a peak Lv 4 martial Royal realm!</p><p>“You … How come your cultivation is at the peak of the fourth level martial Royal realm?”</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing were all shocked.</p><p>According to the information, the Feng family master’s cultivation was only at the LV 3 Martial Emperor realm. Moreover, he was only a Lv 3 Martial Emperor from a small family. His combat strength could not be compared with the disciples of a big sect like Dragon God Valley. Therefore, they had not taken it seriously at first.</p><p>But now, the Feng family head’s aura was actually at the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>At this moment, eight figures appeared in the forest and surrounded Lu Ming and the rest.</p><p>These eight elders had extremely shocking auras. They were all at the LV 3 martial Royal realm.</p><p>there are so many Lv 3 martial Royal realm experts. How is this possible? ”</p><p>Duan Yan exclaimed.</p><p>According to the records, the Feng clan’s clan head had the highest cultivation at the LV 3 martial Royal realm. The other elders were usually at Lv 2 martial Royal realm.</p><p>The Feng family was not a top sect in the Cang region like the Dragon God Valley. The Feng family was just a small family in the six Kong mountain. Naturally, the number of Masters could not be compared with the Dragon God Valley.</p><p>In Dragon God Valley, there were plenty of martial emperors. Even those at Lv 4 Martial Emperor realm and above could be found in large numbers. However, a small clan like the Feng clan naturally did not have so many martial emperors.</p><p>But now, eight Lv 3 martial Royal realm elders had appeared all of a sudden, which was not in line with the records.</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing’s faces turned ugly.</p><p>“Today, all of you will die!”</p><p>The Feng family head’s face was extremely cold. He exuded a cold killing intent and his powerful aura enveloped Lu Ming and the other three.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>The Feng family head suddenly shouted and his figure pounced towards the four people.</p><p>“I’ll deal with him!”</p><p>die! Xu long roared, and the aura of a peak Lv 3 martial Royal realm expert burst out from his body. He unleashed his territory and charged toward the Feng family head.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two of them exchanged a blow. Xu Long’s figure retreated continuously, but he managed to block it in the end.</p><p>At this moment, the eight elders of the Feng family also made their move and charged toward Fu Xing and Duan Yan.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, he was only a first level Martial Emperor. They did not take him seriously.</p><p>The scene was in a chaotic battle.</p><p>Xu long and the Feng family master were fighting.</p><p>There was no doubt that the disciples of Dragon God Valley were better than the small families in all aspects. Their combat power was stronger.</p><p>Duan Yan and Fu Xing joined hands and actually managed to temporarily resist the eight old men, although they were at a disadvantage.</p><p>Xu long, on the other hand, was at a complete disadvantage against the Feng family master.</p><p>After all, Xu Long’s cultivation was one level lower than his opponent’S. Xu long was not a peerless genius who could fight above his level. Therefore, although his combat strength was strong, he was suppressed by the Feng family master.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Feng family’s master was surrounded by a black light, and he kept pressing toward Xu long.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Xu long spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>hehe, brat, you’re dead this time. You’re just a Lv 1 Martial Emperor. Let me deal with you!</p><p>Feng Yi appeared behind Lu Ming, his aura locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>Peak Lv 2 martial Royal realm!</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>At this moment, Xu long suddenly roared, and the aura on his body suddenly soared.</p><p>The fourth level of the Martial Emperor realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
