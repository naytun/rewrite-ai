The power of the fifth stage had already exceeded his imagination.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>...</p><p>Although flowing flame had sent the three Thunder tribulation goshawks flying, he had also left a few bloody marks on his body. The power of the Thunder tribulation was desperately drilling into his body, causing him to spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>But to his despair, more lightning tribulation creatures appeared in the sky. This time, it was two giant pythons, and they pounced toward him.</p><p>At the same time, the three goshawks also pounced towards Liu Yan.</p><p>Now, he could only protect himself. He had no strength to chase after Lu Ming.</p><p>After a few explosions, Liu Yan’s body was in tatters, his hair was disheveled, and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood.</p><p>Many wounds appeared on his body, making him look extremely ferocious.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that his fire spiritual body was extremely powerful, and that it was a low-tier earth spiritual body with extremely tenacious vitality, he would have been in danger.</p><p>However, a few more living beings appeared in the sky and charged toward Liu Yan.</p><p>In the end, a total of nine lightning tribulation creatures surrounded flowing flame and began to fight.</p><p>Flowing flame used all of his strength to fight the nine tribulation lightning creatures.</p><p>hold on, I must hold on. As long as I can survive this wave of lightning tribulation, I can escape. Not only that, I can also use the fifth wave of lightning tribulation to temper my spiritual body and make it stronger!</p><p>Flowing flame warned himself like this. He would use all of his strength to battle with the lightning tribulation creatures.</p><p>Lu Ming was also facing the attacks of six lightning tribulation creatures, but he was much more relaxed than Liu Yan.</p><p>The third bloodline was suspended in the air, and wisps of energy surged into Lu Ming’s body. He activated his vital essence and used the prison suppressing heavenly art to fight the nine lightning tribulation creatures.</p><p>Every time Lu Ming threw a punch, a lightning tribulation creature would be sent flying.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ming could also deliberately release some of the power of the lightning tribulation and let it surge into his body to temper his spirit body.</p><p>it’s not enough. This level of lightning tribulation is more or less enough to train my spirit body. However, it’s still not enough to train my Primal Chaos Domain to become a complete Primal Chaos Domain. I need a stronger lightning tribulation.</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>If other people knew Lu Ming’s thoughts, they would probably be angered to death.</p><p>Other people hoped that the power of the lightning tribulation would be as weak as possible. However, Lu Ming felt that the power of the lightning tribulation was not enough and wanted a stronger lightning tribulation.</p><p>This was already the fifth lightning punishment.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>let’s go! Lu Ming shouted. A layer of chaotic color suddenly spread out from his body.</p><p>The embryonic form of the chaos Domain was activated and Lu Ming’s combat strength increased greatly.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw nine punches in a row.</p><p>The nine living beings formed by the lightning bolts exploded and disappeared into wisps of lightning.</p><p>“The heavens …”</p><p>In the distance, the people who saw this scene were dumbfounded.</p><p>All of a sudden, the nine creatures formed by the lightning tribulation were scattered. This was too shocking.</p><p>Didn’t he see that on the other side, Liu Yan was trying his best to defend?</p><p>he’s done it! He’s passed the Martial Emperor tribulation, the fifth lightning tribulation! What a monster! When he grows up, he’ll be able to compete with the top monsters in the Azure continent!</p><p>that’s right. This man has such potential. He seems to be a disciple of the Dragon God Valley. Another monstrous figure has appeared in the Dragon God Valley!</p><p>Lu Ming’s performance caused many people to discuss.</p><p>Some people’s eyes flickered as they pondered about how to get rid of Lu Ming and eliminate this great enemy.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Liu Yan was panting heavily.</p><p>Lu Ming had defeated nine lightning creatures in one go. The nine lightning creatures that had besieged Liu Yan had also disappeared.</p><p>Liu Yan was in an extremely miserable state. He was covered in injuries, and even now, there were still lightning bolts running around his body, causing his aura to be extremely weak.</p><p>But he finally heaved a sigh of relief. He had passed the lightning tribulation.</p><p>However-</p><p>Liu Yan suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>After the lightning tribulation, the Tribulation clouds in the sky should have dissipated, right? why were they still there? Furthermore, he had become stronger …</p><p>Liu Yan’s eyes widened.</p><p>That’s right, the Tribulation cloud was rolling as if there was a savage beast roaring inside. The Tribulation cloud’s coverage had expanded again, covering a radius of four hundred miles.</p><p>Endless lightning bolts swam in the Tribulation clouds, and the terrifying aura made people who were watching from thousands of miles away gasp.</p><p>“The … The sixth lightning tribulation … No, no… ”</p><p>Liu Yan roared hysterically.</p><p>the sixth round of lightning tribulation, it’s good that it’s coming. Hahaha!</p><p>Lu Ming burst out laughing.</p><p>In the distance, the people who were watching widened their eyes in disbelief.</p><p>It was actually the sixth round of Thunder tribulation. There was still a sixth round of Thunder tribulation.</p><p>They had thought that Lu Ming had survived this ordeal and it was over.</p><p>However, he did not expect that Lu Ming’s lightning tribulation would be beyond his imagination. There was actually a sixth lightning tribulation.</p><p>The sixth lightning tribulation was a legendary lightning tribulation. It had not appeared in the Azure region for a long time.</p><p>“Escape, escape, escape!”</p><p>Liu Yan had gone completely mad, and he frantically tried to escape.</p><p>However-</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>High up in the sky, a sword-light slashed down towards flowing flame.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>One of Liu Yan’s arms was cut off, and the endless power of lightning turned the arm into ashes. The remaining power of lightning madly drilled into Liu Yan’s wound, making it difficult for it to heal.</p><p>Originally, with his fire spirit body, even if he were to lose an arm, he would be able to regrow it in an instant. At most, it would only cost him some vital Qi.</p><p>But now, under the destructive power of lightning, it was impossible.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Then, two more weapons flew down from the sky.</p><p>A saber and a spear.</p><p>They were all made of lightning.</p><p>The sixth Heavenly Tribulation, the lightning tribulation transforming into weapons.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Liu Yan tried his best to block it, but the power of the sixth level was completely beyond the scope of his strength.</p><p>The Tribulation lightning war saber slashed down, breaking through Liu Yan’s layers of defense.</p><p>In the end, the lightning Spear pierced through Liu Yan’s forehead. Liu Yan let out a blood-curdling screech as his entire body exploded into flames and reappeared several kilometers away.</p><p>At this moment, Liu Yan’s face was deathly pale, and his aura was extremely weak.</p><p>If he didn’t have a low-tier earth spiritual body and a fire spiritual body, he would have died.</p><p>However, even if he had managed to escape, the result was already set in stone.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the sky, another combat sword slashed down.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Liu Yan let out a long howl of unwillingness and took one last look at Lu Ming. He hoped to see Lu Ming die under the lightning tribulation.</p><p>However, he was disappointed.</p><p>Lu Ming was like an invincible God of War. His entire body was covered in chaotic light as he fought against the Thunder weapon. With a punch, one of the Thunder weapons was sent flying.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The combat sword slashed through Liu Yan’s forehead. This time, Liu Yan could no longer recover. The destructive power of the lightning had destroyed his body and soul.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>That was Liu Yan’s last thought.</p><p>Why? He had wanted to take the opportunity to kill Lu Ming. Why did he die under the lightning tribulation in the end?</p><p>How ironic was this?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
