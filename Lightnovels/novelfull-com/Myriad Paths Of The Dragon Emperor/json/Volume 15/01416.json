He was still resisting and persevering.</p><p>Time passed by quickly.</p><p>...</p><p>Ten hours passed, and another ten hours passed.</p><p>Lu Ming’s entire skeleton armor was about to be refined. Only the chaos Domain was still covering him.</p><p>The soul fluctuations within the spiritual God were extremely weak, and as time passed, it became weaker and weaker.</p><p>If Lu Ming’s original soul force was equivalent to a moon, then his current soul force was equivalent to a Firefly.</p><p>Another ten hours had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming had been trapped in the world refining tribulation Bell for thirty hours. At this time, Lu Ming’s physical body had completely disappeared. He had been refined by the world refining tribulation Bell.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>At this moment, the dark clouds in the sky slowly dispersed and disappeared. The world refining tribulation Bell below also disappeared with a ‘bang’.</p><p>As for Lu Ming, there was no trace of him at all. There was no one in the air. He had vanished into thin air.</p><p>“The heavenly Tribulation has passed, but where are the people?”</p><p>there’s no one here. It seems that this person didn’t pass the seventh Heavenly Tribulation and was refined by the world refining tribulation Bell!</p><p>it’s a pity that a monster of his generation died under the heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>“I just said that no matter how monstrous he is, he’s useless if he doesn’t grow up!”</p><p>Sighs could be heard from all around. Some people felt pity for Lu Ming, who was a monstrous talent of his generation. He had fallen under the heavenly Tribulation. However, there were also people who mocked him and even gloated.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>we’ve already wasted too much time searching for the treasures left behind by the great emperor!</p><p>Some people spoke, and soon, not a single person was left in this area.</p><p>The sky was completely silent, as if everything that had happened earlier was an illusion.</p><p>Two hours later, a spot of light suddenly lit up at the place where Lu Ming had just transcended the Tribulation.</p><p>At first, the spot of light was a little dim, but slowly, it became brighter and brighter.</p><p>At first, it was like a Firefly, but slowly, it became like a candle. Then, it became like the stars, the sun, and the moon …</p><p>A terrifying suction force was born from the light spot. The original Qi within a radius of tens of thousands of miles was frantically gathering towards the light spot. The light spot was like a black hole, devouring the original Qi.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>Endless origin Qi gathered, and the outline of the light spot slowly appeared.</p><p>It was a human form. It was the spiritual God, Lu Ming’s spiritual God.</p><p>Lu Ming did not die. He was not refined.</p><p>Previously, the Tribulation clouds and the world refinement tribulation Bell disappeared not because Lu Ming was refined and died, but because Lu Ming had successfully passed the Tribulation.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming was recovering.</p><p>The suction force grew stronger and stronger. The origin Energy of heaven and earth in a radius of tens of thousands of miles was extremely dense. Slowly, the origin Energy around Lu Ming’s spirit God turned into liquid. The liquid squirmed and began to condense into a physical body.</p><p>Lu Ming’s physical body.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A Dragon’s Roar shook the nine Heavens.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, the shadow of Nine Dragons emerged and entered Lu Ming’s body, disappearing.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ming’s body was completely in the air. At this time, Lu Ming suddenly opened his eyes. With a thought, a set of clothes appeared and he put them on.</p><p>I’ve finally made it through. What a terrifying world refining tribulation Bell!</p><p>Lu Ming secretly sighed.</p><p>Even Lu Ming had a narrow escape when he faced the refining corpse calamity Bell. In the end, he managed to survive with his strong willpower.</p><p>The world refining tribulation Bell was said to be able to refine the world. Its refining power was too terrifying. Not only could it refine the physical body, but it could also refine the spirit and soul.</p><p>However, there were great benefits to surviving.</p><p>Lu Ming’s current realm had completely surpassed the spiritual God Realm. He had entered the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>He was currently in the early stage of the first level martial monarch realm.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming got up and threw a punch. A loud rumble was heard in the sky. A fist force flew out and pierced a huge hole in a mountain, making it bright from the front and back.</p><p>This was the yuan continent, the great Emperor’s Secret realm, not the divine Ruins ‘continents. Everything in the world was extremely frozen. Lu Ming could punch through a mountain with one punch, so how terrifying was his power?</p><p>Moreover, it was just pure physical strength.</p><p>there’s actually chaos Qi permeating my body!</p><p>Lu Ming sensed it carefully and there was a look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>His muscles and bones seemed to be filled with chaotic Qi. Although it was very faint, it was indeed chaotic Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body had also reached the level of a low-grade Earth Spirit body.</p><p>It was the same as what was recorded in the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>However, due to the chaotic Qi in his body, Lu Ming’s spirit body was stronger than the average inferior Earth Spirit body.</p><p>my soul has also been greatly improved and tempered!</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed to see the soul.</p><p>He could feel that his soul was many times stronger than before, be it in terms of toughness, strength, or soul power.</p><p>It was at least a few dozen times stronger.</p><p>One was heaven and the other was earth.</p><p>From what Lu Ming knew, it was extremely difficult to improve one’s soul. It was more than a hundred times more difficult than improving one’s martial arts cultivation.</p><p>The stronger the soul, the stronger the life force of the spiritual God. Even if the spiritual God was injured, it would not die easily.</p><p>In short, Lu Ming had successfully broken through to the martial Royal realm this time. He had improved greatly in all aspects, and his strength had skyrocketed.</p><p>“I wonder how strong I am now?”</p><p>Lu Ming was filled with anticipation.</p><p>He did not dare to say anything else, but Lu Ming was confident that if he returned to the continent group of the divine Ruins now, it would definitely be easy to kill the fourth level martial emperors.</p><p>Of course, the yuan continent’s Emperor’s combat strength far exceeded the divine Ruins ‘continent. Lu Ming had never fought him before, so it was not easy to measure.</p><p>“Also …”</p><p>Lu Ming stretched out his palm and pointed it at the void.</p><p>Hu …</p><p>Instantly, a terrifying devouring force erupted from Lu Ming’s palm. The origin Qi in the world gathered toward Lu Ming in a frenzy.</p><p>The devouring power, the devouring power of the nine Dragons.</p><p>According to the records of the Dragon God combat body, the Dragon God combat body condensed from Nine Dragons retained the skill of devouring power.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ming’s body could now burst out with devouring power at any time. It was more convenient than before.</p><p>“This way, my cultivation will be faster!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled. With a thought, the devouring power disappeared.</p><p>it’s been more than ten days since I entered the great Emperor’s Secret realm. It’s time to take action. I can’t come to the great Emperor’s Secret realm in vain!</p><p>Lu Ming smiled, then stepped into the air and disappeared.</p><p>The great Emperor’s Secret realm was a plane. It was extremely vast and there were vast mountains everywhere.</p><p>Lu Ming’s speed was very fast. He passed by the mountain below in a flash.</p><p>“There are buildings!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming saw a building halfway up a mountain below him. He flew down.</p><p>This was a Palace. It looked very old, but it was intact. It was obvious that someone had lived here in the past.</p><p>Lu Ming stepped in. The hall was quiet and empty. Lu Ming walked around but found nothing.</p><p>“Even if there’s something here, it would have been taken away by others!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled and left the place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
