Its vitality was much stronger than others. If it were anyone else, they would have been destroyed in body and spirit after a few punches from Lu Ming. However, Liu Yan was only seriously injured but he was able to escape.</p><p>“What powerful battle strength!”</p><p>...</p><p>The surrounding people all took in a cold breath.</p><p>Liu Yan had an innate flame spiritual body. Without a doubt, he was a peerless genius and had cultivated a domain martial technique.</p><p>A Paragon like him could kill other paragons of the same level as if he was chopping melons and vegetables. However, he was completely crushed by Lu Ming.</p><p>let’s go and find a place to break through to the Martial Emperor realm! su mo said.</p><p>being strong now doesn’t necessarily mean that I’ll be strong after breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm!</p><p>Then, in a flash, these people left the place one after another to find a place to break through to the Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>The heaven Earth Yuan Qi here was unbelievably dense. It was much denser than the sects outside. It was indeed worthy of being the secret realm of a great emperor, the cave residence of a great emperor.</p><p>After Liu Yan escaped, Lu Ming took a step forward and appeared in front of Bing Kong.</p><p>“Lu Ming, please spare me …”</p><p>Bing Kong was extremely shocked. When he saw Lu Ming’s arrival, he immediately screamed in fear.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to waste his breath on him. With a flick of his finger, a ray of spear radiance flew out and nailed the ice space to death.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this moment, a violent boom sounded in the distance. Bolts of lightning crossed thousands of miles, as if they were going to tear the world apart.</p><p>Lu Ming looked into the distance and saw dark clouds gathering in the distance. A figure was resisting the lightning under the dark clouds.</p><p>“Someone’s already trying to break through to the Emperor realm so quickly!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>It was obvious that someone was trying to break through to the Martial Emperor realm and was going through the emperor’s great Tribulation.</p><p>Usually, no one would dare to disturb a tribulation. Otherwise, they would be implicated as well.</p><p>Therefore, when ordinary people transcended tribulations, they had no scruples. Others did not dare to disturb them and instead had to leave far away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Dark clouds gathered, and thousands of lightning cauldrons descended from the sky, bombarding the figure and drowning him. The great calamity of an Emperor was extremely terrifying.</p><p>That figure faced the sky and howled, resisting the heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Lu Ming looked around for a while and left the place.</p><p>He also needed to find a place to cultivate in peace and start to break through to the martial Royal realm.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>He had not flown far when another loud noise sounded in front of him.</p><p>Tens of thousands of lightning bolts scattered. Another person was undergoing tribulation and charging towards the Emperor realm.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Following that, Lu Ming heard the sound of thunder exploding in many directions.</p><p>They were both undergoing tribulations and trying to break through to the Emperor realm.</p><p>This time, hundreds of thousands of people had entered, many of whom had reached the limit of the zhizun realm.</p><p>This was especially true for the local young men. They were all suppressing their cultivation. Otherwise, they would have broken through to the Emperor realm a long time ago.</p><p>They had suppressed their cultivation in order to enter the great emperor secret realm. Now that they had entered the great emperor secret realm, they no longer needed to suppress their cultivation and began to break through to the martial Royal realm. Once they entered the martial Royal realm, they would have the upper hand.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lu Ming turned into a beam of light and left the area.</p><p>After flying for more than two hours, Lu Ming arrived at a desolate mountain. He dug out a cave in one of the mountains and flew in. He blocked the cave and sat down cross-legged to begin cultivating.</p><p>First of all, Lu Ming had to adjust his state to the extreme and look for an opportunity to start condensing a spirit body and break through to the realm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p>Lu Ming was like a rock, sitting there cross-legged, motionless.</p><p>The aura on his body became more and more condensed and rounded.</p><p>However, Lu Ming could not find the feeling, the opportunity to break through.</p><p>according to the chaos Scripture, every breakthrough in the cultivation of the chaos will is ten times, a hundred times more difficult than others. There’s no rush. Take it slow!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind. His initially anxious heart slowly calmed down and he entered an ethereal state.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another seven days had passed.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming opened his eyes.</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s face showed a smile.</p><p>He immediately activated the Dragon God combat body technique of the extraordinary chapter of the true war Dragon technique.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodlines emerged and wrapped around Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>A layer of blood-red light emanated from the nine Dragon bloodline and seeped into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>Lu Ming wanted to condense the bloodline of the nine Dragons into his body and merge it with his physical body to cultivate the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>He activated the Dragon God combat body and the power of the nine Dragons ‘bloodline continuously fused into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The stronger one’s bloodline was, the harder it was to refine it.</p><p>Furthermore, there was still a certain level of danger. At this stage of bloodline cultivation, the power was already very strong, and it was very easy to burst the body.</p><p>This was also a step that many people found difficult to take.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ming had long cultivated the pure spirit body and had cultivated it to 100% completion. With the pure spirit body as the foundation, this step was not difficult for Lu Ming.</p><p>The nine Dragon bloodline constantly turned into a bloody light and integrated into Lu Ming’s body at an extremely fast speed. In less than an hour, the nine Dragon bloodline had completely faded. Then, with a bang, the nine Dragon bloodline collapsed and turned into a ball of bloody light, drilling into Lu Ming’s body.</p><p>The nine streams of dragon energy in the nine Dragon bloodline naturally fused into Lu Ming’s body along with the nine Dragon bloodline and became a part of his strength.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming’s body was emitting a Dragon’s Roar.</p><p>However, he had yet to successfully cultivate the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>He still needed to be tempered by the heavenly Tribulation. Only through the tempering of the heavenly Tribulation could he be considered to have truly succeeded in his cultivation.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed out of the cave, releasing his aura.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were bright as he stared at the sky.</p><p>&Nbsp; hu hu …</p><p>In the sky, dark clouds suddenly appeared. These dark clouds seemed to have appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Si la …</p><p>Lightning flashed and Thunder rumbled in the dark clouds. Countless bolts of lightning slithered in the dark clouds like silver Snakes. A powerful pressure spread down, filling the world with an oppressive aura.</p><p>It made people feel as if a great disaster was coming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In the sky, more and more dark clouds gathered, covering an area of a hundred miles.</p><p>“Such a wide range?”</p><p>Lu Ming was secretly shocked.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ming had seen more than ten people crossing the Tribulation. Their Emperor’s great Tribulation was covered in dark clouds and usually spanned about ten miles. The larger ones were only about twenty miles.</p><p>However, the area covered by Lu Ming’s major tribulation was a hundred miles and it was still growing.</p><p>“Then what’s going on?”</p><p>“Someone has become an Emperor and is about to undergo tribulation, but what’s with these tribulation clouds? It’s this big?”</p><p>it’s actually more than a hundred miles away. Who’s going through the Tribulation? could it be an innate spirit body? ”</p><p>The aura of Lu Ming’s tribulation cloud was too shocking. It covered an area of more than a hundred miles, but the pressure spread out to a hundred thousand miles away.</p><p>Many people felt it and flew over in shock.</p><p>maybe it’s really an innate spirit body, but why is it still growing? even the Tribulation clouds of an innate spirit body aren’t this terrifying, right? ”</p><p>Some people stood in the distance and watched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
