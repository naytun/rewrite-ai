Cultivation knew no time. In the blink of an eye, another ten days had passed.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes. Two black rays of light burst out from his eyes. Like two black divine swords, they pierced forward and flew a few hundred meters before disappearing into the cave wall.</p><p>the godly sword technique is so mysterious. I haven’t mastered it yet. According to the records, when I reach a high level, I can become invisible. With a shout, I can destroy the soul of my opponent and kill them without leaving a trace!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered. The more he cultivated, the more he felt that the divine sword technique was unfathomable.</p><p>He recalled the time when the Feng family head had brought them to see the skeletal old man. Duan Yan and Fu Xing had died with a shout from the skeletal old man. It must have been this ability that had destroyed their souls with a shout.</p><p>As for the Feng family’s second master and third master, their souls must have been destroyed, so there was no wound on their bodies.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation. The divine sword technique would definitely become one of his trump cards in the future.</p><p>I’ve been in seclusion for more than half a month. It’s time to go back!</p><p>Lu Ming walked out of the cave and looked into the distance.</p><p>What entered his eyes was a vast mountain.</p><p>He found that he was lost and didn’t know where he was. When the skeletal elder was chasing him, he had randomly chosen a direction to escape in and didn’t pay attention to where he was going.</p><p>“I found a place with people and inquired about it!”</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and disappeared.</p><p>Half an hour later, a city appeared in front of them. Lu Ming flew into the city, and not long after, he flew out again.</p><p>I didn’t expect that I would actually come to the territory of the Tian Yu demon sect!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>The Tianyu demonic sect. He thought of Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Since I’m here, I’ll go see little Qing and see how she’s doing. Why didn’t you enter the great emperor secret realm?”</p><p>Lu Ming had many questions in his heart. He then moved and flew in the direction of the sky demon sect according to the information he had just obtained.</p><p>Lu Ming flew at full speed. After more than a day, mountains came into view ahead.</p><p>They were all demon mountains!</p><p>Demonic mountains that were tens of thousands of feet tall broke into the sky, and this territory was filled with rolling demonic Qi.</p><p>This was the main gate of the Tian Yu demon sect.</p><p>When Lu Ming flew closer, he saw a shocking scene.</p><p>In the depths of the vast demon mountain, there was a pillar of demonic Qi that shot up into the sky. It was incomparably huge, even bigger than many demon mountains.</p><p>“Could it be that the demonic Qi here is all because of that pillar of demonic Qi?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart and continued flying.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud shout and two figures appeared in front of Lu Ming, blocking his way.</p><p>The two young men were in their twenties. They wore black robes and carried demonic sabers on their backs. There was a demonic pattern between their eyebrows.</p><p>A disciple of the Tian Yu demonic sect.</p><p>halt, the Tian Yu demon sect is just ahead. What are you here for? ”</p><p>One of the young men asked.</p><p>“The two of you are too polite!”</p><p>“I’m here to look for someone!” Lu Ming cupped his fists and said.</p><p>“Oh? Looking for someone? Are you looking for a disciple of my Tian Yu demon sect? Tell me, what’s your name? maybe I can help you ask!”</p><p>A young man said.</p><p>her name is Xie nianqing. I wonder if you’ve heard of her? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What? You’re looking for the Holy maiden?”</p><p>The two young men’s expressions suddenly changed and they shouted in a low voice.</p><p>“Holy maiden?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>How did Xie nianqing become the saintess of the Tianyu demonic sect?</p><p>He remembered that Xie nianjun had become the Holy Virgin of the Tian Shen sect after joining it. Could it be that Xie nianqing had also become the Holy Virgin of the Tian Yu demon sect?</p><p>At this moment, countless thoughts were running through Lu Ming’s mind.</p><p>“Brat, you should leave, quickly leave this place!”</p><p>The young man on the left said in a cold voice.</p><p>“Why is that? I’m really looking for nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>How dare you! How dare you call the saintess by her name? you should take a good look at yourself. You’re just a Lv 2 martial Royal realm martial artist and you want to get close to the saintess? dream on!</p><p>The young man on the left berated.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned and said,”I’m …” Your saintess “old friend came from the same place!”</p><p>“From the same place?”</p><p>The two young men were stunned. The young man on the right said, ” you are from the divine wilderness continent? ”</p><p>“Not bad!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>The two young men looked at each other and one of them said, ” boy, you’d better not lie to us, or else you’ll end up in a miserable state. Also, you and the saintess come from the same place, so what’s your relationship with her? the saintess is very busy and needs to cultivate in seclusion. We can report this to the higher-ups, but if we find out that you’re lying, you know the consequences, boy!</p><p>“I’m nianqing’s boyfriend!”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How dare you, kid, you’re looking for death!”</p><p>The two young men bellowed when they heard that. They glared at Lu Ming with murderous intent.</p><p>“Brat, how dare you profane the Holy maiden! You deserve to die!”</p><p>Who Do You Think You Are? you’re just an ant. How dare you say that you’re the saint’s boyfriend? don’t you leave today!</p><p>The two young men shouted coldly. They unsheathed their demonic blades and a cold aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Both of them were at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. everything I’ve said is true. You can upload it to your saintess. Just say that Lu Ming is here to see her. She’ll naturally know!</p><p>“You’re looking for death. You still dare to talk nonsense. Kill!”</p><p>The young man on the left bellowed. The demonic blade in his hand slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic blade of the young man on the right also slashed out violently, aiming for Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>It was as if he wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes. A long spear appeared in his hand and he swept it across the two demonic blades.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The demonic blade trembled, and a terrifying power gushed in. The bodies of the two young men trembled, and they were forced to retreat.</p><p>He only managed to stabilize himself after taking dozens of steps back, causing the air to rumble.</p><p>“How dare you fight back! You’re looking for death!”</p><p>“Don’t you dare leave this place today!”</p><p>The two young men shouted.</p><p>“You two, Lu Ming asked nicely and told you the truth, but you want to kill me. How preposterous!”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>If not for the fact that they were in the Tianyu demonic sect, the two of them would have been dead by now.</p><p>what truth? Bullsh * t! You’re insulting the Holy maiden!</p><p>One of them shouted.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>At this time, a ray of demonic light flashed, and another young man appeared.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>This young man had his hands behind his back, and his eyes were like lightning. His aura was many times stronger than the two young guards.</p><p>senior brother Jin Yu, you’re here just in time. There’s a lecherous man here who actually said he’s the boyfriend of saintess Xie nianqing …</p><p>One of the young men shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The young man named Jin Yu’s eyes suddenly turned cold. His cold killing intent burst out and enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>you’re just an ant. How dare you say that you’re the saint’s boyfriend? you’ll die for what you’ve said!</p><p>The Golden feather stepped forward, and its powerful aura pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>Peak Lv 4 martial Royal realm!</p><p>This person’s cultivation had reached the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
