I don’t mind. Besides, eighth Senior sister’s abilities are profound. I’m very impressed!</p><p>...</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, I have something to tell you!”</p><p>Longyuan Shan smiled mysteriously and said,”actually, eighth Junior Sister is not human!.”</p><p>“Inhuman? A demon?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and he muttered.</p><p>eighth Junior Sister, your true form is a Dragon, a true dragon, a pure-blooded true dragon!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“What? A pure-blooded true dragon!”</p><p>Lu Ming was greatly shocked.</p><p>In the continent group of the divine Ruins, Lu Ming had never met a pure-blooded divine beast. The one with the highest concentration of blood was only 90% of the divine beast’s blood.</p><p>However, although 90% and pure-blood didn’t seem to be much different, it was actually a world of difference.</p><p>Pure-blooded divine beasts were born with an advantage and were extremely powerful. Even the innate spirit body of humans was slightly inferior to the body of pure-blooded divine beasts.</p><p>This was especially true for terrifying existences like true dragons.</p><p>It was said that once a true dragon was born, it would have the strength of the spiritual ocean realm. Without cultivating, it would naturally reach the Martial Emperor realm when it reached adulthood.</p><p>Once he started cultivating, his achievements would be even higher.</p><p>Furthermore, after a pure-blooded divine beast entered the Emperor realm, its body would undergo another transformation, becoming even more terrifying.</p><p>Of course, there were also differences in the true Dragon’s talent. After becoming a Martial Emperor, there were also differences in the strength of their physiques.</p><p>Lu Ming felt that Xue ningxin’s physique was definitely not at the level of a low-grade earth spiritual body. It had even surpassed a medium-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>It was a true dragon. No wonder it was so powerful.</p><p>the yuan continent is indeed the yuan continent. We have just arrived and we have already met a pure-blooded true dragon. Then, there must be many other pure-blooded divine beasts in the yuan continent, such as the Qilin and the Phoenix.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was filled with infinite expectations.</p><p>The yuan continent was bound to be more exciting and brilliant than the continents of the divine Ruins.</p><p>The rise of the paragons and the competition between the divine beasts made Lu Ming’s blood boil.</p><p>“Ninth Junior Brother, where are you going?”</p><p>Longyuan mountain asked.</p><p>“I’m planning to go to Treasure Dragon Palace to exchange for some useful items!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Oh, I’m also going to the treasure Dragon Palace. I’ll Take You There!”</p><p>Longyuan mountain laughed.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded and followed Longyuan mountain to Treasure Dragon Palace.</p><p>The treasure Dragon Palace was located on a huge Snow Mountain. Disciples of the Dragon God Valley could exchange contribution points for treasures here. Of course, they could also exchange treasures for contribution points.</p><p>Soon, Lu Ming and Longyuan mountain arrived at the treasure Dragon Palace.</p><p>Outside the treasure Dragon Palace, there were many people coming and going. Fortunately, the treasure Dragon Palace was huge enough to accommodate so many people.</p><p>“So many experts!”</p><p>Lu Ming used his spiritual senses to scan the area and found that everyone here was an Emperor. As for those below the Emperor realm, he did not see a single one.</p><p>There were many counters around the treasure Dragon Palace.</p><p>Junior Brother, you can walk around freely. I still have things to do here!</p><p>Longyuan mountain said.</p><p>“Senior brother, you can go!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Longyuan Shan nodded and walked towards one of the houses while Lu Ming casually sized it up.</p><p>After looking around for a while, Lu Ming walked to a counter. A white-haired old man was sitting in front of the counter.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask if there’s any spiritual liquid here?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>of course there is. There are all kinds of spiritual liquids recorded in this jade talisman. You can choose whatever you want!</p><p>The old man took out a jade talisman and handed it to Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming took it and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He realized that there were hundreds of types of spiritual liquid recorded in it. The function and effect of each spiritual liquid were recorded very clearly.</p><p>Lu Ming looked at them one by one. After a while, he returned the Jade card to the old man.</p><p>“Senior, I need myriad Spirit Night. How do I exchange for it?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked.</p><p>myriad Spirit Night can promote the growth of spiritual medicine. It’s an item that alchemists need. It’s extremely precious. One tael is one thousand contribution points!</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>1000 contribution points? that’s really expensive!</p><p>Lu Ming muttered in his heart.</p><p>One contribution point was equivalent to 100 mid-grade raw stones. 1000 contribution points were equivalent to 100000 mid-grade raw stones, which was only 50 grams. The price was almost the same as the ultra-quality life potion.</p><p>However, for the growth of the path-understanding ancient tree, everything was worth it.</p><p>“Senior, I’ll exchange for five kilograms of myriad spirit liquid!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Alright, give me your identity token!”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>Lu Ming passed the identity token to the old man. The old man took out an array disc and scanned the identity token before returning it to Lu Ming. Lu Ming realized that the contribution points in the identity token had been reduced by one hundred thousand to two million and fifty thousand.</p><p>Then, the old man took out a Jade bottle and handed it to Lu Ming. The Jade bottle was filled with ten thousand spirit liquid, weighing five kilograms.</p><p>Lu Ming kept it, satisfied.</p><p>senior, I wonder if you can exchange for the materials of a true dragon here. You need a true dragon above the Martial Emperor realm, such as Dragon bones, dragon blood, Dragon marrow, and so on. They need to be full of spirituality.</p><p>Lu Ming whispered to the old man.</p><p>Lu Ming had obtained dragon bones that were not full of spirituality in the divine wilderness continent before. However, the cultivation level of those dragon bones was not very high when they were alive. Furthermore, too much time had passed and most of the spirituality had been lost. Those dragon bones were not of much use to Lu Ming now.</p><p>I do have materials of a true dragon that are at the rank of a Martial Emperor and above, but not many of them. Furthermore, the price is very high!</p><p>The old man muttered.</p><p>“Senior, I’m willing to exchange!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Hmm, I’ll help you ask!”</p><p>The old man took out a Jade voice transmission talisman and sent a message. Not long after, the old man received the news.</p><p>according to your request, there’s a piece of Dragon Bone that weighs 15 kilograms. After testing, it’s suspected that the cultivation of this true dragon was at the Saint realm when it was alive. It’s full of spirituality, but the price is two million contribution points. Do you want it? ”</p><p>The old man said.</p><p>“Two million contribution points?”</p><p>Lu Ming was dumbfounded.</p><p>A twenty kilogram piece of Dragon Bone was actually worth two million contribution points.</p><p>This was the price of two Saint weapons!</p><p>However, the other party said that this true dragon seemed to have reached the Saint realm when it was alive. No wonder it was so expensive.</p><p>“I’m changing!”</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming gritted his teeth.</p><p>The old man looked at Lu Ming in surprise.</p><p>Lu Ming’s cultivation seemed to be only at the first level Martial Emperor realm, but he actually had two million contribution points. He was really not simple.</p><p>“Alright, wait a moment!”</p><p>The old man left the counter after he finished speaking. Lu Ming knew that the other party had gone to get the Dragon bones.</p><p>After a while, the elder returned with a storage ring and handed it to Lu Ming.”You can check it first!”</p><p>Lu Ming took the storage ring and scanned it with his spiritual senses. He found a snow-white Dragon Bone lying quietly in the storage ring, emitting a powerful spiritual essence.</p><p>One could even vaguely see small dragons swimming on the Dragon bones.</p><p>This was definitely not the Dragon Bone of an ordinary Emperor-level true dragon. It should be the Dragon Bone left behind by a Saint realm true dragon.</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed. He passed his identity Jade card to the elder.</p><p>The old man swiped the array disc again and Lu Ming’s contribution points became fifty thousand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
