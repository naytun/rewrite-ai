The cloud Dragon Valley master had said that there was nothing else he could teach Lu Ming in the future. It seemed that he was destined to figure it out on his own.</p><p>Ming ‘er, you have to be careful. The more powerful the domain is, the more difficult it is to cultivate it. Especially when it comes to breaking through, the difficulty will be greater. The chaos Domain is even more so. So, in the future, you have to spend more effort on the chaos Domain!</p><p>...</p><p>After a moment of silence, the cloud Dragon Valley master warned him seriously.</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. He had already noticed this.</p><p>also, from now on, you’re free to enter any place in Cloud Dragon Valley, including my library. There’s my cultivation experience in there. You can go and study it. It might be helpful to you!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“Many thanks, master!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed and bowed to express his gratitude.</p><p>He could enter any place in the cloud Dragon Valley as he wished. He also had the cloud Dragon Valley master’s cultivation insights.</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master’s cultivation was unfathomable. Lu Ming estimated that he was definitely not at the bright Saint realm. It was very likely that he had surpassed the bright Saint realm. The cultivation experience of such an existence was definitely precious.</p><p>If Lu Ming could comprehend it, it would definitely be of great help to his cultivation.</p><p>At that moment, a Jade token appeared in the hands of the cloud Dragon Valley master. this is your identity token. It contains your information and your contribution points. Take a look and see if it’s correct!</p><p>Lu Ming took the identity token and inserted his essential core. A row of information appeared in his mind.</p><p>It was all his basic information. In the column of contribution points, the number was 2.15 million contribution points.</p><p>These were the contribution points he had exchanged for with the sect’s treasures.</p><p>Lu Ming kept the identity token.</p><p>Ming ‘er, there’s one thing you have to take note of. Although I’ve accepted you as a true disciple and joined the cloud Dragon Valley, the cloud Dragon Valley is a part of the Dragon God Valley. Therefore, for the first two years, you’ll still have to listen to the arrangements of the Dragon God Valley and complete some basic tasks. Two years later, you won’t need to be assigned any tasks by the sect. You can choose on your own!</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master said.</p><p>“En!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded. This was very easy to understand. Lu Ming was not too surprised.</p><p>It was normal for new disciples to make some contributions to the sect.</p><p>also, you’ve offended the people of Silver Dragon Valley. Those guys are narrow-minded. You must be careful of them during this period. Their elders don’t dare to interfere, but I won’t interfere with the competition between the young generation. You have to rely on yourself!</p><p>Finally, the cloud Dragon Valley master warned him again.</p><p>“Thank you, master. I will be careful!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“Mm, go!”</p><p>The cloud Dragon Valley master waved his hand.</p><p>Lu Ming bowed and left the place.</p><p>I can’t waste my 2.15 million contribution points. Let’s go and see if there are any true dragon materials to exchange for them!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>If he had the materials from a true dragon, he would be able to upgrade the Dragon God combat body.</p><p>Lu Ming flew all the way out, planning to go to the treasure Dragon Palace to ask.</p><p>He had not flown far when a figure blocked in front of him.</p><p>It was a young woman in a snow-white dress. She looked like she was only 18 or 19 years old. She had a lithe figure and was extremely beautiful, like a fairy that had descended from the nine Heavens.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The young woman spread her arms and stood in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“And you are?”</p><p>Lu Ming stopped and asked.</p><p>“Are you master’s new direct disciple?”</p><p>The young woman blinked her big eyes curiously, staring at Lu Ming and sizing him up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. From the other party’s tone, he should be another legacy disciple of the cloud Dragon Valley master.</p><p>“That’s right. I’m master’s ninth new disciple, Lu Ming!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Hahaha! It’s really you! Quick, quickly call me Senior Sister. I’m your eighth Senior Sister Xue ningxin, I’m finally not Little Junior Sister!”</p><p>The young woman almost jumped up and laughed out loud in excitement.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Lu Ming was rather speechless. It turned out that the other party was his Senior Sister. But she was so young …</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming was helpless. He cupped his fists and said,”Greetings, eighth Senior Sister!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, okay, cough cough!”</p><p>Xue ningxin was overjoyed, but she still had to put on a mature look. She glanced at Lu Ming, coughed a few times, and said,”Little Junior Brother, in the future, just follow Senior Sister. Senior Sister will guarantee you a good life!”</p><p>As he said that, he even patted himself and continued, ” Junior Brother, I heard that you’re quite strong and have shown your power in the great Emperor’s Secret realm. Come, come, come, let’s have a few moves!</p><p>Having said that, he looked at Lu Ming in anticipation.</p><p>“A few moves?”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless.</p><p>that’s right. Sigh, there are too few people in our Cloud Dragon Valley. It’s so boring. Those ordinary disciples don’t even dare to fight with me. In the past ten years, master has only accepted three true disciples. The other senior brothers are so old and have profound cultivation. I’m no match for them at all. There’s also that massacring maniac. He’s out there every day to train and kill. No one has fought with me …</p><p>Xue ningxin kept on talking.</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. He quickly interrupted Xue ningxin and said, ” “Senior Sister, I still have something to do. Maybe next time!”</p><p>With that, he was about to leave.</p><p>no, now. Today. Are you looking down on me? ”</p><p>Xue ningxin’s eyes widened and she threw a punch at Lu Ming.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>This punch was shockingly powerful, and the space around it began to rumble.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat. He did not dare to be careless. He spread out his Chaos Domain and threw a punch at Xue ningxin.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The two fists collided. Lu Ming’s body trembled as he felt a terrifying force surging towards him. His body trembled and he could not help but take nine steps back before he could stabilize himself.</p><p>But Xue ningxin did not move.</p><p>“What a terrifying power!”</p><p>Lu Ming gasped in shock.</p><p>The other’s strength was beyond his imagination. The most shocking thing was that he felt that Xue ningxin had used most of her physical strength, not much of her true essence.</p><p>Just the strength of his body alone was enough to force him back nine steps.</p><p>not bad. You’re only at the LV 1 Martial Emperor realm, yet you’re only forced to take nine steps back after receiving my punch. Hmm, not bad, not bad. Unfortunately, your cultivation is too low!</p><p>Xue ningxin mumbled and sized Lu Ming up curiously. Little Junior Brother, you have to cultivate well. When your cultivation improves, you can practice with me!</p><p>Without waiting for Lu Ming to reply, he jogged away.</p><p>“I …”</p><p>Lu Ming was speechless. This Senior Sister was too weird.</p><p>Most importantly, the other party looked young but his strength was shocking. Lu Ming was shocked.</p><p>it seems that there are countless geniuses in the yuanlu. Moreover, my cultivation is indeed too low!</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>haha, ninth Junior Brother, don’t mind her. That’s just how she is!</p><p>A hearty laugh came over as Longyuan mountain stepped through the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
