They cast a cold glance at Lu Ming and walked to the side, not asking further.</p><p>we can basically confirm that the other party is here for revenge. Their next target is young master Feng!</p><p>...</p><p>Xu long spoke again, causing Feng Yi’s face to turn pale.</p><p>“My esteemed envoys, you must save me!”</p><p>Feng Yi cried out, his face filled with fear.</p><p>don’t worry. Judging from the previous situation, the other party only wants to launch a sneak attack at night, which means that they aren’t very strong and are afraid of us. This will make things easier. Right now, we need to lure them over!</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>“Attract? How do we attract them?”</p><p>Feng Yi said.</p><p>we’ll set up a formation around young master Feng’s bedroom. Once the other party steps into the formation, they’ll be caught in the wind!</p><p>Xu long said with confidence.</p><p>Feng Yi’s eyes lit up. that’s right. Why didn’t I think of that? the Feng family also has a few ninth-grade alchemists. They can set up the array together!</p><p>“I also cultivate the Dao of inscription, so I can help you!”</p><p>Duan Yan stepped out and said.</p><p>Lu Ming only listened. There was a faint glint in the depths of his eyes. He did not say anything, nor did he say that he would help set up the array.</p><p>Now, he was almost done with his second body and was cultivating in the mountain and river diagram.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get started!”</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>Immediately, the Feng family’s inscription Masters and Duan Yan set up a large array in Feng Yi’s bedroom. They used various concealment arrays to hide the aura of the large array. If one did not observe carefully, one would not be able to see the array.</p><p>He was busy all the way until the next night before he finally finished setting up the formation.</p><p>That night, Lu Ming and the rest did not stay near Feng Yi’s bedroom. Instead, they went back to their rooms to rest. If they stayed near Feng Yi, they would only alert the enemy.</p><p>After two days, there was still no movement.</p><p>Until late at night on the third day.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cry for help broke the silence of the night.</p><p>It was Feng Yi.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes and rushed out.</p><p>As soon as he rushed out, he saw a figure rising up from Feng Yi’s bedroom. This figure was still holding Feng Yi in his hand as he flew toward the six void mountain.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>At that moment, Xu long, Fu Xing, and Duan Yan appeared and chased after the figure at top speed. Lu Ming did the same.</p><p>One was chasing, and the other was escaping. In the blink of an eye, they had rushed into the six void mountain.</p><p>As soon as they rushed into the range of the six Kong mountain, the other party swooped down and rushed into the forest.</p><p>Lu Ming and the other three followed closely behind and rushed into the forest.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>Feng Yi shouted.</p><p>In the night sky, Lu Ming and the rest could clearly see that the figure in front of them was wearing a loose black robe. He grabbed Feng Yi and continued to move forward at an extremely fast speed. In the dark forest, he was like a ghost.</p><p>“You can’t escape today. Surrender!”</p><p>Xu long shouted. The genuine vitality in his body surged, and his speed became faster and faster.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the group of them had traveled thousands of miles in the six Kong mountain. Lu Ming and the rest were getting closer and closer to the black-robed man.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming shouted loudly.</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing were startled and could not help but stop.</p><p>“Lu Ming, what are you doing? What’s the meaning of this?”</p><p>Duan Yan berated Lu Ming.</p><p>“What is it called? You’ll know when you see that person!”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently.</p><p>Duan Yan and the others looked forward and were stunned.</p><p>That was because the black-robed man had stopped running.</p><p>That was strange. Why did the black-robed man stop when Lu Ming stopped instead of seizing the opportunity to escape?</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing were all confused.</p><p>because there’s a killing formation in front of us. Once we step in, we’ll die for sure!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Absolute-kill formation?”</p><p>Xu long and the other two’s faces changed dramatically.</p><p>Duan Yan observed carefully and said, ” that’s impossible. There’s no trace of an array in front of us. It’s impossible for there to be a big array. If there really is a big array, how can I not see it? Lu Ming, don’t talk nonsense here!</p><p>“Oh? If you don’t believe me, you can try!”</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>Duan Yan’s expression changed. Seeing that Lu Ming was so certain, she was skeptical and did not dare to go forward.</p><p>She would not joke around with her life.</p><p>Xu long and Fu Xing were both suspicious.</p><p>hehe, I didn’t expect that the array would be so well-hidden that you could find it. You are indeed the disciples of Dragon God Valley!</p><p>The black-robed man in front of him sneered, his voice hoarse and unpleasant.</p><p>“Who are you? The Feng family is a subsidiary family of the Dragon God Valley. If you dare to kill the Feng family’s people, you’re going against the Dragon God Valley. I’ll give you a chance now, let Feng Yi go!”</p><p>Xu long said coldly.</p><p>hehe, Dragon God Valley disciple, how impressive!</p><p>The black-robed man sneered.</p><p>“Hehe, stop pretending!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming sneered. you’ve been setting this up since the moment we stepped into the Feng family. No, from the moment you asked for help from Dragon God Valley, you’ve been setting this up. Your purpose was to lure us here and into the formation. Am I right, Feng family head? ”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s words left Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing dumbfounded.</p><p>Feng family head? How was that possible?</p><p>“Lu Ming, what nonsense are you talking about? The Feng family, the Feng family, we saw it with our own eyes, they are dead!”</p><p>Duan Yan berated.</p><p>who said that the one we saw was the real Feng family head? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“This …”</p><p>Xu long, Duan Yan, and the others fell silent.</p><p>Indeed, who said that the person they saw was the Feng family head?</p><p>If the person they saw was not the Feng family head, then wasn’t Feng Yi?</p><p>The few of them looked coldly at Feng Yi.</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed man had already put Feng Yi down, and Feng Yi was not injured at all.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you would be able to see through it, even though it was so well-hidden!”</p><p>The black-robed man suddenly sighed and took off the hood on his head.</p><p>The pupils of Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing shrank.</p><p>It was indeed the Feng family head. He looked exactly the same as the Feng family head they saw when they opened the coffin and examined the corpse.</p><p>In that case, the one they saw when they opened the coffin and examined the corpse was really fake.</p><p>In the world of martial Dao, it was very easy to change a person’s muscles, bones, and appearance through special means.</p><p>The world of martial Dao recognized people mainly by their aura and appearance. They could change, but their aura would never change.</p><p>However, they had never seen the Feng family head before, so they naturally did not know his aura. Therefore, it was easy for the Feng family to find a fake person to impersonate the Feng family head.</p><p>young man, my plan was flawless. I really want to know how you found out.</p><p>The Feng family master looked at Lu Ming with a curious look but he did not panic.</p><p>“Flawless? Hehe, in my opinion, it’s full of flaws!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
