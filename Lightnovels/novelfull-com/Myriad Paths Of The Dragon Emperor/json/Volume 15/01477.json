With their powerful cultivation, they chased closely behind Lu Ming.</p><p>Not long after, they had flown a long distance, but the distance between the two sides had not widened, nor had they come closer.</p><p>“Bubble!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to bubbles.</p><p>Bubbles cried and opened a space-time Tunnel. Lu Ming flew in and the next moment, he appeared thousands of miles away. The distance between them widened in an instant.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s not that easy to escape!”</p><p>Mo he bellowed and waved his hand. A treasure flew out.</p><p>It was a flying shuttle. As soon as it flew out, it grew in the wind and quickly became a hundred meters long.</p><p>“Get on!”</p><p>Mo he shouted.</p><p>The other five experts of the 7th rank all flew onto the space-breaking shuttle.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The space-breaking shuttle glowed and flew out at an astonishing speed. It was much faster than their flying speed and was approaching Lu Ming quickly.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed.</p><p>The speed of the space-breaking shuttle was too fast. It was a special tool used by the martial experts of the yuan continent to travel.</p><p>Lu Ming’s face was gloomy. He used all his strength and flew at full speed, but the space-breaking shuttle behind him was still approaching.</p><p>After a while, Lu Ming had no choice but to ask bubbles to open the space-time Tunnel again to increase the distance between them.</p><p>“Kid, let’s see how long you can run.”</p><p>Inside the space-breaking shuttle, mo he’s eyes were very cold.</p><p>Half a day passed just like that.</p><p>“We can’t continue like this!”</p><p>Lu Ming frowned. If this went on, bubbles would not be able to take it and her energy would be depleted. If he was caught up to, he would not have a second chance to escape.</p><p>A large river appeared in front of them.</p><p>The strange thing was that the water of the river was black, as black as ink. It was extremely strange.</p><p>The other side of the river was also a black world.</p><p>Black soil, black rocks, and even black flowers and trees.</p><p>Separated by a River, it was like two different worlds. It was extremely strange.</p><p>However, Lu Ming was only surprised for a moment. He did not stop at all. He flew over the river and headed toward the strange black world.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Not long after Lu Ming flew over the river, the space-piercing shuttle appeared. However, it did not continue flying. Instead, it stopped in front of the river.</p><p>Mo he and the other five Lv 7 martial Royal realm experts flew out of the space-breaking shuttle. Mo he then put it away.</p><p>“This brat actually escaped into the desolate land of death, the head of the six great Forbidden Lands of the Azure continent!”</p><p>Mo he frowned and looked at the world on the other side of the river. His eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>The other five people looked across the river with the same fear.</p><p>The six forbidden grounds of the Azure continent were filled with danger, and even Saints would die if they entered.</p><p>The desolate land of death in front of them was even more terrifying. It was the head of the six great Forbidden Lands. No one knew when it had existed. It was only known that it had existed for a long time. According to legend, in the distant past, great emperors had entered it, but in the end, they retreated in fear.</p><p>No one knew what the great emperor had encountered inside.</p><p>He only knew that it was dangerous, extremely dangerous.</p><p>“Young master mo he, what should we do now?”</p><p>One of the black-robed men asked.</p><p>“Chase him, chase him in and kill him. I want to see him alive, and I want to see his corpse dead!”</p><p>Mo he’s voice was cold.</p><p>He was full of confidence. Bringing five seventh level martial emperors to kill Lu Ming was supposed to be a surefire plan. With Lu Ming’s cultivation, he could not possibly escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ming had escaped from him. How was he going to explain it to him when he returned?</p><p>Therefore, he hated Lu Ming to the core and had to kill him.</p><p>“Chase after them?”</p><p>The five Lv 7 martial Royal realm experts ‘expressions changed drastically.</p><p>yes, and it’s you guys. Hurry up, or else we won’t be able to see that kid’s figure. You should know who gave the order this time. If that kid escapes, I’ll definitely be fine when I go back. But you guys, you should know the consequences!</p><p>Mo he said coldly.</p><p>The five seventh level martial Royal realm experts ‘faces turned even uglier. They looked at each other and gritted their teeth. They turned into five demonic lights and rushed across the opposite bank of the river, chasing after Lu Ming.</p><p>kid, you’re just like an ant. You should listen to your fate and be a good ant, but you came to the Tian Yu demonic sect. You’re a Toad lusting after a Swan’s meat. I can only make you disappear!</p><p>Mo he looked at The Dark World as his cold voice rang out.</p><p>After Lu Ming flew across the river, he continued to fly at high speed.</p><p>Below, the terrain was very complicated. There were pits and strange rocks. Moreover, these strange rocks were all black.</p><p>On the ground, there were many huge ancient trees.</p><p>However, these ancient trees were black in color. Their trunks and branches were twisted together, making them look very strange.</p><p>Moreover, the more they flew, the more ancient trees appeared, and they were larger and taller.</p><p>Ancient black trees that were hundreds of meters tall were everywhere, covering the land.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that there were five people chasing after him.</p><p>“These guys are really persistent!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Lu Ming’s eyes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had flown tens of thousands of miles, but they were still in this dark world. It seemed that this dark world was boundless.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming felt a large shadow cast over his head. He could not help but look up.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils shrank at a glance.</p><p>A gargantuan bird had appeared in the sky.</p><p>The giant bird had a very strange appearance. It had two heads and its entire body was pitch black. Its eyes were red like burning red flames. Most importantly, it was too big. When it spread its wings, it covered the sky and the sun. Like a dark cloud, it cast a shadow over Lu Ming and the five Lv 7 martial Royal realm experts behind him.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>Suddenly, the giant Eagle screeched. A shocking gravitational force seemed to burst out from its mouth and enveloped the LV 7 Martial Emperor realm expert.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The LV 7 martial Royal realm expert screamed in horror. He lost control of his body and flew into the giant bird’s mouth. Then, he was swallowed by the giant bird like an ant.</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked. A Lv 7 martial Royal realm expert was completely helpless against the giant bird and was swallowed.</p><p>The strength of this giant bird was extremely terrifying.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>The giant bird chirped and its eyes were like lightning as it scanned Lu Ming and the remaining four seventh level martial emperors.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s expression changed drastically. He immediately bent down and rushed to the ground.</p><p>The ground was covered with black ancient trees that were hundreds of meters tall. They could block the giant bird’s vision and help it escape.</p><p>At the same time, the four seventh level martial Royal realm experts also swooped down and rushed into the ancient black tree, one thousand and one hundred feet behind Lu Ming.</p><p>As expected, as soon as they rushed to the ground, the giant bird cried out and looked around. It didn’t continue to attack, but instead soared in the sky.</p><p>“These guys are really not giving up!”</p><p>Lu Ming realized that the four seventh level martial emperors were still chasing after him. They were running at top speed in the dark forest.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Ming took a step forward and cast the wind elemental technique, rushing out as well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
