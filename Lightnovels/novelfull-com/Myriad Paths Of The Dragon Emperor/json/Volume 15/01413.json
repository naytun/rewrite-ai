Boom! Boom!</p><p>The purple lightning tribulation was getting more and more terrifying. Lightning bolts as thick as mountains kept striking down on the two of them.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming exploded. He punched out continuously with both fists. Streams of fist force rushed into the sky and destroyed the purple fire lightning tribulation.</p><p>The Tribulation clouds in the sky seemed to be enraged by Lu Ming’s outburst and the rush of the flowing flames. They churned violently and more purple flame lightning tribulation fell.</p><p>“So many lightning tribulations? But you can’t stop me!”</p><p>Liu Yan shouted coldly. He swung his palm and a blade-light burst out, breaking the lightning tribulation one by one. He was rapidly approaching Lu Ming.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming’s figure moved and he retreated rapidly, pulling apart the distance between him and Liu Yan.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>The flowing flame continued to break through the lightning and chased after Lu Ming.</p><p>The Tribulation cloud covered a radius of two hundred miles. Lu Ming was in the center of the Tribulation cloud. Liu Yan was only eighty to ninety miles away from Lu Ming. However, this distance was difficult to cross due to the lightning tribulation.</p><p>As long as Liu Yan came close, Lu Ming would retreat.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>you’re courting death! Liu Yan shouted angrily as his aura exploded. The aura of a martial Royal realm expert filled the air, and flames covered his body. His innate flame spiritual body had broken through the martial Royal realm and completed a transformation. It had become even more terrifying, reaching the level of a low-grade spiritual body.</p><p>The flames condensed into a long blade, and with a slash, it destroyed the lightning tribulation.</p><p>His speed increased.</p><p>However, the purple lightning tribulation suddenly disappeared.</p><p>However, the Tribulation cloud seemed to be really angry. This time, it didn’t even prepare. In the sky, dense lightning bolts struck down.</p><p>This time, the lightning had four colors.</p><p>There were four different colors of lightning, and the surface of each lightning was covered with different things.</p><p>Some were covered in flames, some were covered in wind, some were covered in water, and some were golden in color.</p><p>The fourth lightning punishment had arrived.</p><p>This lightning tribulation was several times more terrifying than the pure purple flame lightning tribulation.</p><p>This kind of lightning tribulation was the terrifying lightning tribulation that an innate spirit body had to face.</p><p>damn it! The fourth lightning punishment is coming so quickly!</p><p>Liu Yan roared in his heart.</p><p>The time it took for the third and fourth lightning punishment to pass was faster than he had expected.</p><p>The fourth lightning punishment was something that even he had to be careful about.</p><p>“A tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure!”</p><p>With a thought, a purple bead flew out and hovered above Liu Yan’s head, emitting a light barrier that enveloped Liu Yan.</p><p>&Nbsp; the Tribulation lightning struck the purple light barrier, causing it to shake violently, but it was still blocked.</p><p>what a powerful tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure! It can even block the fourth Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>In the distance, many people revealed envious expressions.</p><p>An ordinary tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure would be considered pretty good if it could withstand the second lightning tribulation. However, Liu Yan’s tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure was actually able to withstand the fourth lightning tribulation. Its power was astonishing, and it was definitely a top-tier tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure.</p><p>Flowing flame’s speed increased greatly, and he approached Lu Ming rapidly.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Then, he rapidly retreated.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Liu Yan bellowed as he swung his palm down. A vast flaming Saber Light slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>But as soon as the blade light appeared, it was dispersed by the lightning tribulation.</p><p>“Damn it, I have to get close to that guy to kill him!”</p><p>A cold glint flashed in Liu Yan’s eyes. He broke through the lightning tribulation and approached Lu Ming at top speed. However, Lu Ming used the wind element technique and retreated at top speed, maintaining a distance of several dozen miles from Liu Yan.</p><p>“What’s wrong with this guy? How can he be so fast in the face of the fourth lightning tribulation?”</p><p>After chasing for a while, the distance between the two was still unable to be closed, causing Liu Yan to become a little anxious.</p><p>He could not kill Lu Ming if he did not pull him closer.</p><p>Of course, he did not know that the fourth wave of lightning punishment was a fatal threat to others. However, to Lu Ming, it was just fine. He did not have to go all out to resist it.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and one escaping, circled around in this area.</p><p>“Damn it, brat, I’ll spare your life today!”</p><p>After chasing for a while, seeing that he could not catch up to Lu Ming, Liu Yan wanted to retreat.</p><p>you can’t come and go as you please. Accompany me to continue the Tribulation!</p><p>Lu Ming sneered.</p><p>As soon as Liu Yan retreated, Lu Ming advanced and closed the distance between him and Liu Yan, allowing the Tribulation cloud to envelop Liu Yan.</p><p>“You’re looking for death!”</p><p>Liu Yan flew into a rage and stopped retreating. He wanted to rush forward and kill Lu Ming, but as soon as he advanced, Lu Ming retreated, and as soon as he retreated, Lu Ming advanced.</p><p>This infuriated Liu Yan, and he was unable to get away.</p><p>This stalemate continued for a while before the lightning tribulation suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“The heavenly Tribulation has passed. This guy needs to stabilize his realm. Let’s see how you can catch me.”</p><p>The disappearance of the heavenly Tribulation caused Liu Yan to be overjoyed.</p><p>With the heavenly Tribulation gone, he could easily escape and find an opportunity to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>However, the next moment, Liu Yan’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>That was because the Tribulation clouds in the sky had not dissipated at all. Instead, they had become even thicker.</p><p>The Tribulation cloud that had originally covered a radius of 200 li suddenly expanded to cover a radius of 300 li. The oppressive pressure it gave off made it difficult for Liu Yan to breathe.</p><p>“How is that possible? Could this be the fifth lightning tribulation?”</p><p>Liu Yan roared, revealing a look of fear.</p><p>“Run, run, run!”</p><p>Liu Yan almost wanted to cry. He turned around and ran, trying to escape the range of the lightning tribulation.</p><p>Gah!</p><p>At this moment, a screech resounded through the sky as a huge Goshawk descended from the sky at an incredible speed. In an instant, it had arrived above Liu Yan’s head and was swooping down towards him.</p><p>“Fifth Heavenly Tribulation, Thunder tribulation transformation!”</p><p>Liu Yan roared in horror, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming was still going through the heavenly Tribulation. Moreover, it was the legendary fifth Heavenly Tribulation, the Thunder tribulation manifestation.</p><p>An ordinary innate spirit body would only have four lightning punishments when they went through the martial Royal ordeal.</p><p>Unless it was some extremely abnormal guy, there would be a fifth lightning punishment.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation-transcending treasure, the goshawk formed by the lightning tribulation, crashed into Liu Yan’s Heavenly Tribulation-transcending treasure, and the light screen formed by the heavenly Tribulation-transcending treasure trembled violently, almost collapsing.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Liu Yan’s only thought right now was to escape, the further the better.</p><p>However, Lu Ming would not let him have his way. He was rapidly approaching him.</p><p>“The lightning tribulation is taking form?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s lips curled into a faint smile.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time he had encountered such a lightning tribulation. It had appeared when he was undergoing the spiritual God tribulation.</p><p>Roar! Roar!</p><p>Two loud roars were heard as the two giant tigers formed by the lightning tribulation pounced toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Prison suppressing heaven art!”</p><p>Lu Ming threw two punches and the two giant tigers were sent flying.</p><p>On the other side, two more lightning tribulation goshawks appeared, and a total of three of them pounced toward Liu Yan.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The light screen formed by the flowing flame tribulation-transcending heavenly treasure finally couldn’t hold on any longer and exploded.</p><p>The bead also exploded.</p><p>The heavenly Tribulation-transcending treasure exploded, and a few goshawks pounced toward Liu Yan.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Liu Yan roared. His domain covered his entire body and he charged toward the three goshawks.</p><p>However, he had already passed the martial Royal ordeal and entered the martial Royal realm. Now that he was enveloped by the clouds of ordeal, the power of the lightning tribulation that struck him was greater than that of Lu Ming. It was his own ordeal.</p><p>He had to face his own five great tribulations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
