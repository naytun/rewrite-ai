This force was not something he could resist at all.</p><p>He turned pale with fright. How could Lu Ming be so powerful?</p><p>...</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The terrifying power slammed into his body. He screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body flew far away and hit a mountain peak in the distance.</p><p>“How is that possible?”</p><p>He widened his eyes and glared at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming had been staying in the divine Ruins ‘continent group. It was impossible for the divine Ruins’ continent group to have domain martial arts techniques. How could Lu Ming’s combat strength be so powerful?</p><p>Originally, he was full of confidence. He had come to the yuan continent two years earlier than Lu Ming, and his cultivation had greatly increased. He had reached the limit of the refined state. Moreover, he was good at socializing and had gotten to know Liu Yan and the others. He had obtained a domain martial art technique that was suitable for him. After successfully cultivating it, his combat power had increased greatly and had already far surpassed Eden and Zi Wuji.</p><p>Initially, he had wanted to suppress Lu Ming after meeting him this time to take revenge for what happened back then.</p><p>However, after he met Lu Ming, everything was beyond his expectations.</p><p>Not only had Lu Ming’s cultivation reached the Supreme-being level, but his combat strength was also so powerful that he completely crushed him. He had severely injured him with one move.</p><p>this is your combat power, this is what you rely on. Trash will always be trash. Even if you came to the yuanlu two years earlier, you still can’t withstand a single blow!</p><p>Lu Ming berated coldly.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>Bing Kong was so furious that he spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>hehe, you do have some combat power. However, with this bit of combat power, you dare to be so arrogant in front of my tianshen sect’s disciples. I think you’ve found the wrong person!</p><p>A cold voice was heard and a scorching aura enveloped Lu Ming.</p><p>Flowing flame appeared in front of Lu Ming. A golden flame leaped from his body, and a terrifying temperature spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>what a high temperature! This person also has an innate spirit body!</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>The flames on Liu Yan’s body were not condensed through intent or domain, but directly emitted from his body.</p><p>Only a spirit body could directly emit flames and have an astonishing temperature.</p><p>In the surroundings, there were originally some onlookers, but at this time, they couldn’t help but retreat.</p><p>A few of them were disciples of the Dragon God Valley, but they all retreated coldly and had no intention of attacking.</p><p>“Liu Yan’s fire spirit body is extremely powerful. That kid is dead for sure!”</p><p>ordinary people can only be killed in seconds when they encounter an innate spirit body!</p><p>A few people spoke, gloating.</p><p>nonsense, just make your move. I don’t have time to waste on you!</p><p>Lu Ming berated.</p><p>“Since you’re in a hurry to reincarnate, I’ll fulfill your wish! Fire God’s slash!”</p><p>Liu Yan roared. His palm was like a blade as he slashed it down at Lu Ming.</p><p>The flames condensed and formed a flaming saber, slashing toward Lu Ming’s head.</p><p>It was like the war blade of the fire god, with terrifying power.</p><p>The embryonic form of the chaos Domain surrounded his body and Lu Ming threw a punch.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The prison-suppressing stele appeared in the void, making Lu Ming’s punch indestructible. It collided with the flaming saber.</p><p>Shockwaves spread out, and the air shook. The flaming saber collapsed.</p><p>As for Liu Yan, he was also forced to retreat by the backlash.</p><p>“This is your strength?”</p><p>Lu Ming said indifferently, revealing a hint of mockery.</p><p>Liu Yan’s expression darkened. Lu Ming’s combat strength had exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Fire god technique, eight desolations!”</p><p>Liu Yan let out a long roar, and his entire body seemed to have transformed into a fire god. He was over a thousand meters tall, and with a single slash of his saber, he could annihilate everything.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming rushed up. There was no shocking phenomenon. He only threw a punch.</p><p>It was a simple punch, but its power was enough to suppress mountains and rivers.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The fist force and the saber clashed for the second time.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The sky and earth rumbled as endless flames spread out in all directions. The flaming saber was once again shattered.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming stepped in the air and threw a punch. A terrifying fist force crossed the void and hit the thousand-meter-tall fire god.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge hole was pierced through Vulcan’s huge body.</p><p>The flames that filled the sky disappeared, and Liu Yan frantically retreated. A large hole had appeared in his chest, and it was bright from the front and back.</p><p>However, he was fine. It was as if his entire body was made of flames. At this moment, the flames were wriggling in the Big Hole, and the Big Hole was quickly repairing itself.</p><p>“I have a fire spiritual body, you can’t hurt me!”</p><p>Liu Yan’s furious voice rang out.</p><p>“A fire spirit body is indeed amazing!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>After breaking through to the Martial Emperor realm, the spirit body was condensed from the bloodline, so it naturally had some characteristics of the bloodline.</p><p>For example, natural-type bloodlines, fire, ice, water, lightning, and so on.</p><p>Before reaching the Emperor realm, it was already difficult to destroy these bloodlines. For example, flames could be destroyed, but the body could reform.</p><p>Of course, that was when he was performing the bloodline fusion.</p><p>However, after condensing a spirit body, it was even more amazing.</p><p>For example, the spiritual body of fire made one’s entire body seem to be made of flames. Even if one’s entire body was destroyed, it could reform and greatly increase one’s vitality.</p><p>However, there was a limit to everything.</p><p>If he encountered someone with a high cultivation level, he could directly use his powerful strength to obliterate the spirit body.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s mouth curled into a cold smile. He continued to step forward and charged toward Liu Yan.</p><p>“Flame cage!”</p><p>Liu Yan roared, his entire body turning into flames.</p><p>The flames that filled the sky formed a huge cage that enveloped Lu Ming. It wanted to use the power of the flames to refine Lu Ming.</p><p>“Chaos!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm was filled with chaotic light. The embryonic form of the chaos Domain was like a chaotic ball that wrapped around Lu Ming’s fist.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw a punch at the fire cage.</p><p>This time, the fire cage collapsed and turned into flames.</p><p>At the same time, the flames that filled the sky flew into the distance and began to gather. Liu Yan’s body reappeared, but this time, his face was unusually pale and blood was flowing out of his mouth.</p><p>“You can extinguish my flames.”</p><p>Liu Yan roared in fear.</p><p>Lu Ming’s punch just now had started to obliterate his spirit body, causing him to be seriously injured.</p><p>If a few more punches came, he would probably die.</p><p>what flame spirit body? trash!</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly. He stepped into the air and headed toward Liu Yan.</p><p>His Primal Chaos Domain was formed by the emperors of countless domains. It was not uncommon for him to be able to wear down the spiritual body of fire.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Liu Yan didn’t dare to stay any longer and turned to run.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A fist force filled with chaotic light shot toward him.</p><p>Liu Yan’s body was pierced through by the fist force, leaving a hole in it. This time, no matter how he tried to use the flames to recover, the hole could not be healed in a short time.</p><p>He spat out a few mouthfuls of blood, but he didn’t dare to stop. He turned into a streak of fire and fled.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming threw another punch across the air.</p><p>The fist radiance destroyed Liu Yan’s body, turning him into balls of flames that flew into the distance and disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
