They broke through Lu Ming’s lightning and fire domain and slashed at him.</p><p>...</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out. As it waved its claws, it set up a space-time defense around Lu Ming.</p><p>&Nbsp; although the skeletal elder’s attack was profound, it was still blocked by the spacetime domain and weakened by a portion.</p><p>Then, it passed through the defense of the black wings and struck the spiritual God heavily.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Jade armor shook violently. A powerful force passed through the Jade armor and bombarded his soul. Lu Ming’s expression changed and he could not help but retreat.</p><p>The other party’s attack was indeed terrifying. Even though Lu Ming had the Jade armor and his soul spirit was dozens of times stronger than ordinary people, he still felt a tearing pain.</p><p>If it was an ordinary person, even with the protection of the Jade armor, their soul would have been destroyed.</p><p>“Still not dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming was shocked, but he did not know that the skeletal elder was even more shocked.</p><p>The soul attack he launched could even destroy the soul of a seventh level Martial Emperor. However, Lu Ming, who was only at the first level Martial Emperor realm, managed to block it.</p><p>This was an attack that he had launched without caring about his injuries. It was extremely harmful to his heavily injured body.</p><p>“Kill! I must kill him. Otherwise, if he spread the news that I’m still alive, I’ll be in big trouble!”</p><p>The skeletal old man roared in his heart. He launched another attack without caring about his injuries.</p><p>The Grim Reaper’s scythe slashed down again. The skeletal elder in front of him struck out with his palm, and a huge palm print came crashing toward Lu Ming.</p><p>This time, he didn’t just launch a soul attack, he also launched an ordinary attack.</p><p>“Leave this to me!”</p><p>Dandan flew out and opened its mouth. A ball of world shadow flew out and hit the huge palm print.</p><p>At the same time, bubbles attacked, and terrifying blades of spacetime slashed at the other party.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then fight to the death!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered with ferocity. Ignoring the Reaper’s Scythe behind him, he flapped his wings and charged forward.</p><p>He was going to launch a counterattack.</p><p>His glabella glowed, and a shield appeared in front of him. It was as large as a mountain.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The illusory world that dandan spat out was the first to bear the brunt. It collided with the huge palm print and the illusory world collapsed. Then, it faced the huge shield that Lu Ming had conjured.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>This shield was a holy weapon, and it was indestructible!</p><p>The palm print landed on the shield. The shield trembled and was sent flying, but the palm print also disappeared.</p><p>The palm print was offset.</p><p>Bubbles ‘blade of spacetime continued to slash at his opponent.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up. It seemed that the other party was really extremely weak. Other than the soul attack, which was more powerful, ordinary attacks were not strong at all.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>die! Lu Ming shouted angrily and punched continuously with both fists. More than ten fist forces, together with bubbles ‘space-time blade, were blasted toward the skeletal elder.</p><p>The skeletal old man’s expression changed. His body was covered in black light as he continuously struck out palm prints.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>A violent explosion sounded. After the terrifying collision, the skeletal elder’s body floated backward.</p><p>At the same time, the Reaper’s Scythe hit Lu Ming, causing his soul to feel a tearing pain.</p><p>However, Lu Ming gritted his teeth and endured it.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>With a flap of his black wings, Lu Ming charged towards the skeletal elder.</p><p>He just stared at the skeletal elder, completely ignoring the attack of the death God’s scythe behind him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The black wings were like two heavenly blades, slashing at the skeletal elder. At the same time, a long spear appeared in Lu Ming’s hand and he swept it out.</p><p>[ thirteen charged strikes ]!</p><p>The Emperor spiritual weapon spear shook four times and four terrifying forces exploded at the skeletal elder.</p><p>At the same time, dandan and bubble’s attacks also arrived and crushed each other.</p><p>The skeletal old man roared as he extended his bony claws and struck out.</p><p>A terrifying collision erupted, and the force swept in all directions. In the end, the skeletal elder was at a disadvantage and was sent flying. The black light on his body trembled.</p><p>“Damn it, damn it, kid, I want you dead!”</p><p>The skeletal old man roared madly, and the black light on his body burned like a flame.</p><p>The giant god of death turned into a beam of light and merged into the skeletal elder’s body.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Then, a terrifying aura emanated from the skeletal elder’s body. Like an ancient divine mountain, it pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>This was the terrifying aura of a Saint.</p><p>“Not good, this old man is going to risk his life!”</p><p>Dandan exclaimed.</p><p>“Devil Soul Blade kill!”</p><p>The skeletal elder roared. Black light gathered around his body and formed a huge blade that slashed at Lu Ming.</p><p>The giant blade slashed, and the clouds in the sky were cut in half.</p><p>This huge saber made Lu Ming feel a terrible sense of danger.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The shield was the first to fly out and block in front of him.</p><p>After that, dandan and bubbles set up their defenses.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The giant blade slashed down and the shield was sent flying. Then, dandan and bubble’s defense were also destroyed.</p><p>The huge saber then slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>The black wings folded in front of him, and a chaotic domain enveloped them.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The huge blade slashed at the black wings, causing them to shake violently. Lu Ming’s body trembled violently and he spat out a mouthful of blood. Then, he fell to the ground like a meteorite.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Lu Ming landed heavily on the ground, creating a huge pit.</p><p>“WOWO, what a powerful force!”</p><p>Lu Ming spat out a mouthful of blood. He felt his qi and blood surging in his body. Several bones in his body were broken.</p><p>The skeletal elder flew toward Lu Ming with an illusionary blade in his hand. His powerful aura enveloped Lu Ming, and the flames in his eyes burned.</p><p>Lu Ming was more difficult to deal with than he had imagined. The cultivation technique he cultivated was shocking, and he had many treasures on him. He even had several holy weapons. He did not look like a first level Martial Emperor at all.</p><p>At the same time, he also brought a space-time spirit mouse and a little turtle with him. He couldn’t recognize them, but they were definitely amazing.</p><p>All in all, Lu Ming’s vitality was too tenacious.</p><p>An ordinary first-tier martial Royal realm expert could easily kill the skeletal elder even if he was severely injured. However, Lu Ming was still alive.</p><p>He had used some forbidden techniques without caring about his injuries, but Lu Ming was still alive.</p><p>The skeletal elder was shocked, but at the same time, he was even more determined to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>“What do we do? This won’t do. I’ll be exhausted to death by this old man!”</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“Right, the prison-guarding stele!”</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This skeletal old man was obviously cultivating an evil way of martial arts. The prison-suppressing stele had a strong ability to restrain the evil way and the demonic way.</p><p>Lu Ming had almost forgotten about this.</p><p>This was also related to the fact that Lu Ming had cultivated a spirit body after he had entered the martial Royal realm. After he had cultivated a spirit body, he had subconsciously ignored the remaining two bloodlines.</p><p>He rarely used it.</p><p>Lu Ming suddenly recalled it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
