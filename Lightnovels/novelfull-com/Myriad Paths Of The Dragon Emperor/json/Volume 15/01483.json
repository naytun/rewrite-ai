In the depths of the valley, the Ming Lian body’s forehead glowed with golden light. Golden sword energy formed within the formation.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>...</p><p>The golden sword radiance swept across and attacked mo he from all directions.</p><p>“Break, Break, Break!”</p><p>Mo he looked up to the sky and let out a long roar. His entire body was filled with demonic light, and his pitch-black demonic blade swept in all directions. Like an unrivaled demonic god, he had a kind of Bini’s spirit!</p><p>Wherever the demonic blade passed, the golden sword Qi collapsed.</p><p>Not far away, Lu Ming’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Mo he had such a strong combat strength. When he fought with mo he a few days ago, mo he didn’t even use his full strength.</p><p>The combat strength that he was displaying now was extremely shocking.</p><p>Although there were only two days, the formation set up by the secondary body of inscription would not have too terrifying a power, but it should not be too much of a problem to kill a Lv 8 martial Royal realm expert.</p><p>But now, it was blocked by mo he.</p><p>“A superior earth spiritual body!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Mo he’s spiritual body should be a superior earth spiritual body. With such a body, his combat strength was extremely shocking.</p><p>In the entire Azure region, there were countless forces of various sizes, but there weren’t many upper-class earth spiritual bodies. Every one of them was a top-tier heaven’s favorite, invincible among those of the same level, and fighting against those of a higher level was as easy as eating and drinking.</p><p>“What’s the use of a formation? I’ll break your great formation!”</p><p>Mo he let out a long roar. His momentum was like a rainbow, and his demonic blade was shocking. With one slash, countless golden sword lights collapsed.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A demonic blade slashed at a Valley on the side. The valley trembled and crumbled. The power was shocking.</p><p>He wanted to break through the canyon and destroy Lu Ming’s array.</p><p>“Hehe, then I’ll give you another big gift!”</p><p>At this moment, dandan had already moved from Ming Lian’s secondary body to Lu Ming’s main body’s shoulder. She grinned and inscriptions flashed on her claws.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>In the valley, another large array appeared.</p><p>This was the great formation set up by dandan.</p><p>The formation appeared and formed a huge hammer, which smashed at mo he’s face.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>As the hammer fell, mo he’s demonic blade trembled. His body also trembled and he took a few steps back.</p><p>Then, the endless sword Qi stabbed down, and the huge hammers smashed down.</p><p>Mo he’s expression was grave as he slashed out a saber radiance. However, it was cut off by the huge hammer. Under the continuous attacks, it collapsed.</p><p>“Haha, smash, smash, smash, smash this bastard to death …” No, I’ll smash this piece of sh * t to death!”</p><p>Dandan shouted arrogantly and kept waving her claws.</p><p>Mo he was finally completely suppressed. He could not fight back and could only defend passively.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sword Qi was everywhere. Some of them almost chopped off mo he’s head, leaving a bloody mark on his face.</p><p>A look of fear flashed across mo he’s face.</p><p>“Magical night mirror, appear!”</p><p>Mo he shouted in a low voice. A beam of light shot out from between his brows. Then, a pitch-black ancient mirror flew out and suspended above mo he’s head. It sprinkled down a beam of light and enveloped mo he.</p><p>The surrounding sword Qi and the giant hammer struck the light screen scattered by the ancient mirror. The light screen trembled, but it didn’t break.</p><p>“Holy weapon!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze flickered.</p><p>The ancient mirror that mo he used was a Saint weapon.</p><p>It was normal to think about it. It was normal for a genius like mo he to have a Saint weapon to protect himself.</p><p>Mo he used his Saint weapon to protect himself, giving up his own defense and focusing on exploding.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>The demonic blade swept in all directions and collided with the golden sword radiance and the hammer. The two large arrays began to shake.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Mo he slowly charged in one direction, breaking through the sword Qi and the hammer, and slowly approached the exit of the canyon.</p><p>If this continued, mo he would most likely escape.</p><p>it seems like I’ve underestimated the strength of a heaven’s favorite!</p><p>A thought flashed across Lu Ming’s mind, but the murderous intent in his eyes grew stronger.</p><p>“Dandan, bubble, do it!”</p><p>Lu Ming sent a voice transmission to dandan and bubbles. Then, he spread the black wings on his back and rushed towards mo he with a Swoosh.</p><p>In the process of rushing out, Lu Ming’s hands were rapidly forming seals.</p><p>“Primal Chaos sky-turning seal!”</p><p>A low roar came from Lu Ming’s mouth. A Great Seal of chaos condensed above mo he’s head. With terrifying fluctuations, it pressed down on mo he.</p><p>At the same time, dandan flew out and expanded rapidly. Just like last time, she stepped on the chaos sky-turning seal with both feet, making the power of the chaos sky-turning seal even more terrifying.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal pressed down on mo he with an earth-shattering force.</p><p>Mo he’s eyes narrowed. He knew the power of the chaos sky-turning seal very well. At this time, he let out an angry roar, and the pitch-black ancient mirror emitted ten thousand Zhang of demonic light, welcoming the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a terrifying boom, the chaos sky-turning stamp struck the pitch-black ancient mirror, causing a terrifying blast.</p><p>At this time, Lu Ming had already rushed to a place not far from mo he. His eyes suddenly shot out two black rays of light at mo he.</p><p>Godly sword technique!</p><p>The jet-black light was like a divine sword, shooting into mo he’s body and attacking his spiritual God. Mo he felt a tearing pain in his spiritual God, which made his Qi and the circulation of his true Yuan slow down.</p><p>At this moment, bubbles launched an attack. A few space-time blades slashed towards mo he.</p><p>At the same time, the two great formations, endless golden sword Qi and the huge hammer, also bombarded mo he.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>Mo he’s body trembled violently. Although he tried his best to resist, his defense was finally broken by so many attacks.</p><p>The scattered light from the black ancient mirror collapsed with a bang.</p><p>“Slash!”</p><p>The black wings on Lu Ming’s back were like heavenly blades. They slashed at mo he, trying to cut him in half.</p><p>Mo he’s pupils contracted sharply. At the critical moment, he moved sideways.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Although mo he had avoided the fatal disaster, he still couldn’t completely avoid it. One of his arms was cut off by the black wing.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>arghh! mo he screamed with madness in his eyes. With a furious roar, the blood from his broken arm flew toward the pitch-black ancient mirror. At this moment, the mirror shone with a bright light, emitting a dark red demonic light and a terrifying power.</p><p>Lu Ming hurriedly used the black wings to shield his body. His body trembled as he was hit by the force and he was sent flying, crashing into the wall.</p><p>Similarly, the power of the chaos sky-turning seal was finally exhausted and it collapsed. It was screaming and shouting as it was sent flying.</p><p>The golden sword radiance and giant hammer that the formation had condensed were also destroyed.</p><p>“Lu Ming, I’ll remember this. The next time we meet, I’ll definitely kill you!”</p><p>A furious roar came from mo he’s mouth.</p><p>The pitch-black ancient mirror exuded a blood-red light, wrapped around mo he, and suddenly rushed out of the scope of the formation, out of the canyon, turned into a blood-red light, and fled away at an extreme speed.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the time is too short, and the power of the formation is not enough!”</p><p>Lu Ming looked in the direction where mo he had left, feeling a little regretful.</p><p>If he was given two more days to refine the second body, the power of the formation would be even stronger, and he would definitely be able to kill mo he.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
