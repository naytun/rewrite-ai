With one flap, Lu Ming turned into a black lightning bolt and streaked across the void, traveling a hundred miles in an instant.</p><p>This was the yuan continent. This speed was already extremely shocking.</p><p>...</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that the black light behind him was moving faster and was slowly approaching him.</p><p>“Air-frozen bead!”</p><p>Lu Ming increased the influx of energy into the air-frozen bead and the speed suddenly increased. He could barely keep up with the speed of the old man behind him.</p><p>The two of them, one chasing and the other escaping, left the range of the six Kong mountain in the blink of an eye and went far away.</p><p>This chase and escape took half a day.</p><p>this kid’s speed is actually so fast. But to maintain this speed, let’s see how long you can last.</p><p>Behind him, the skeletal old man sneered.</p><p>As expected, Lu Ming’s speed gradually slowed down.</p><p>To maintain such a speed and fly at full speed, the consumption was too great.</p><p>The continuous use of the wind elemental technique and the control of the black wings consumed a lot of essential core. Now, Lu Ming’s essential core was running out.</p><p>The distance between the skeletal elder and Lu Ming was getting closer.</p><p>kid, even though I was severely injured 80000 years ago and have yet to recover, it’s still a piece of cake for me to deal with you, a mere Lv 1 Martial Emperor realm martial artist!</p><p>The skeletal old man’s voice was unusually cold.</p><p>“Old man, do you really think you can catch me?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s voice was still calm.</p><p>“Oh, really? I’d like to see what other tricks you have up your sleeve!”</p><p>The skeletal old man sneered.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>All of a sudden, a passageway appeared in front of Lu Ming. He stepped into it and in the next moment, he was thousands of miles away.</p><p>space-time domain! This is the space-time domain!</p><p>The skeletal old man cried out in alarm.</p><p>That’s right. Lu Ming had asked bubbles to help him open the space-time domain and appear thousands of miles away in an instant, putting some distance between him and the skeletal old man.</p><p>After putting some distance between them, Lu Ming waved his hand and a large pile of raw gemstones appeared in the air. A powerful devouring force erupted from Lu Ming’s palm and devoured the raw gemstones. He then continued flying, refining the raw gemstones as he flew, replenishing his essential core.</p><p>“Don’t even think about escaping!”</p><p>The skeletal old man bellowed in rage, his sunken eye sockets flickered with raging flames.</p><p>The two of them continued their pursuit. When the skeletal elder closed the distance between them, Lu Ming called for bubbles to help him open a space-time Tunnel. The distance between the two of them widened again.</p><p>After a few times, the skeletal elder flew into a rage and could not catch up to Lu Ming.</p><p>“No, I can’t go on like this. I’m seriously injured, and it’s not good for my recovery. I have to take this person down as soon as possible. Besides, he has the help of the space-time spirit rat. Why did it appear again? now, kill it while it’s still not strong!”</p><p>The skeletal old man’s eyes flickered as he finally gritted his teeth, as if he had made up his mind.</p><p>“Split!”</p><p>The skeletal old man growled. Then, a beam of light split off from his body and entered the space. It disappeared in a flash.</p><p>However, the skeletal elder’s aura had weakened a little.</p><p>Lu Ming was flying in front of him. Suddenly, there was a fluctuation in the space in front of him. A dark light flashed and a figure appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted and he stopped in his tracks. It was the skeletal elder.</p><p>The skeletal old man actually appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A powerful aura emanated from the skeletal elder and locked onto Lu Ming.</p><p>“Brat, let’s see where you’re going to run to now!”</p><p>The skeletal old man sneered.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Behind him, there was the sound of air being torn. A black light flashed and another skeletal elder appeared behind Lu Ming.</p><p>The two men in Black surrounded Lu Ming.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming realized that the skeletal elder did not have a lower body at all, only his upper body. The skeletal elder was wearing a loose black robe, which he had not noticed in the cave.</p><p>boy, you’re not simple. You’ve comprehended the chaos realm and have a space-time spirit rat as your companion. I can’t let a person like you grow up. Today, you’ll die!</p><p>The skeletal old man sneered as a jet-black light shot out from his glabella.</p><p>The pitch-black light was like a divine sword that shot toward Lu Ming at an unbelievable speed.</p><p>With a thought, Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain spread out and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The jet-black ray of light shot into the chaos realm and emitted a sizzling sound. However, in the end, the chaos realm weakened a part of its power. The remaining part shot into Lu Ming’s body and charged directly at the spiritual God.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The black light struck the spiritual God’s Jade armor, causing it to shake.</p><p>In the end, the Jade armor blocked the black light, but a small part of the power still passed through the black armor and struck the soul.</p><p>Lu Ming felt a vibration in his soul and a numbing itch.</p><p>what a strange attack. It directly attacks the soul. Fortunately, I have the Jade armor and my soul power is extremely strong, so I was able to block it!</p><p>Lu Ming had many thoughts in his mind.</p><p>“Brat, not only do you have a spiritual God defensive treasure, but your soul power is also extremely powerful. Then you should die even more!”</p><p>The killing intent in the skeletal elder’s eyes intensified when he saw that his attack could not do anything to Lu Ming.</p><p>old man, you were seriously injured tens of thousands of years ago and have been struggling at death’s door for tens of thousands of years. You don’t have much strength left. Why don’t you find a place to recuperate? you’re courting death!</p><p>On Lu Ming’s other shoulder, he shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, even if I’m seriously injured and my strength is reduced to less than one percent, it’s more than enough to kill you all!”</p><p>The old man behind sneered. A layer of black light spread out from his body. His body began to turn illusionary, and the black light became more and more intense.</p><p>Lu Ming’s gaze was solemn and he was on high alert.</p><p>Although he had been severely injured in the past, he was still a true Saint stage powerhouse. He could not underestimate any Saint stage powerhouse.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The elder’s body became more and more illusory, and in the end, he turned into a huge black god of death. He held the god of death’s Scythe, and his killing intent was cold.</p><p>Lu Ming’s pupils constricted. He thought of The Dark Child of the southern netherworld in the divine wilderness continent. The Dark Child’s bloodline was a death god that could hurt people’s souls.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Grim Reaper held a sickle and slashed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>In front of him, the skeleton sneered. His eyes were burning with fire. Two black divine swords shot out from his eyes and went for Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lightning, fire!”</p><p>Lu Ming shouted. The chaos realm turned into a lightning realm that filled the sky. At the same time, the lightning realm was burning with raging flames.</p><p>Apart from some equally terrifying domains, the chaos Domain could transform into thousands of domains.</p><p>According to the cultivation technique that the other party was cultivating, Lu Ming guessed that lightning and fire should be able to restrain the other party.</p><p>Zzzzzzz …</p><p>The Reaper’s Scythe and the two black divine swords struck the lightning and fire domain, producing sizzling sounds and black smoke.</p><p>It was indeed useful!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The skeletal old man shouted, his aura vast and mighty.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
