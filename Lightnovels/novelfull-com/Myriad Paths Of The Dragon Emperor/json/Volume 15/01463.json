Lu Ming and the rest rose into the air and flew in the direction pointed out by the Feng family head.</p><p>They flew all the way to the depths of the six void mountain. After flying for more than 100000 miles, they finally landed in a remote Canyon.</p><p>They came to a cave in the depths of the canyon.</p><p>This cave was indeed very well hidden. If one were to search slowly, it would not be easy to find.</p><p>this ancient ruin is an ancient cave mansion. It’s very big inside. I guess it’s a place where a peerless expert secludes himself!</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>Xu Long’s eyes flashed with greed as he said, ” “You better be telling the truth. Otherwise, you know the consequences!”</p><p>“I’m telling the truth. I got my Bell from this cave abode!”</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>His words made Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing more convinced.</p><p>That Bell was indeed extremely wondrous and could harm one’s soul. Such a treasure was very difficult to buy in the outside world.</p><p>On the way, Xu long kept it without any hesitation. He did not even bother to ask Lu Ming, the person who had defeated the Feng family head.</p><p>Lu Ming did not say a word along the way. He just followed the crowd.</p><p>“If you’re worried, I can lead the way. My cultivation has been sealed anyway, so I can’t escape!”</p><p>The Feng family head said.</p><p>“Alright, you lead the way!”</p><p>Xu long put the Feng family master down.</p><p>The Feng family master immediately stepped into the cave. Xu long, Duan Yan, and Fu Xing quickly followed, as if they were afraid that the treasure inside would be taken by others.</p><p>Lu Ming was the last to enter.</p><p>After entering the cave, there was a narrow passage. After going in for about a few hundred meters, they saw a faint light.</p><p>After walking through the passage, the front suddenly opened up. It was a huge underground cave. There were gemstones on the surrounding walls, which emitted a faint radiance.</p><p>The Feng family head revealed a sinister smile on his face as he suddenly strode forward and knelt down.</p><p>“Your subordinate greets elder mo hun!”</p><p>The Feng family head repeatedly kowtowed to a figure.</p><p>A figure!</p><p>Lu Ming and the few of them were shocked.</p><p>&Nbsp; only now did they notice that there was a figure sitting cross-legged in the middle of the cave.</p><p>It was an old man who looked extremely old. There were only a few strands of white hair left on his head. The skin on his face was shriveled and wrinkles piled up like mountains. There seemed to be no flesh or blood on his body. He was like a skeleton sitting there.</p><p>However, his eyes were strangely dark. He stared at Lu Ming and the rest, revealing a deep desire.</p><p>There was actually someone else in this ancient cave mansion. It was a skeleton-like old man.</p><p>“Hehehe, you’ve done well!”</p><p>The skeletal old man let out an ear-piercing and unpleasant smile.</p><p>“Many thanks for elder’s praise. This is what this subordinate should do!”</p><p>The Feng family head said in a flattering manner.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest retreated slowly while Duan Yan berated them loudly.</p><p>“We’ve been tricked!”</p><p>Lu Ming said in a deep voice.</p><p>“Tricked?”</p><p>Duan Yan was stunned.</p><p>Feng family head, his purpose is probably to bring us here. He told us to go around him before, so he brought us here. It was all an act!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>hahaha, boy, you’re really smart. That’s right, I was pretending. My purpose was to bring you here and offer you to elder mo hun as a sacrifice. It would be better if I could capture you and bring you here. If I couldn’t, I could trick you into coming here!</p><p>The Feng family head laughed.</p><p>Fake. The ancient ruins were all fake.</p><p>The Feng family head’s goal was to bring them here.</p><p>“Guys, look over there!”</p><p>Duan Yan suddenly pointed behind the skeletal old man, her voice trembling.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest looked over and were shocked.</p><p>There was a pile of bones there. No, to be precise, it was a pile of dried corpses.</p><p>It was the same after he was devoured by Lu Ming’s devouring power.</p><p>“This person wants to use us to recover!”</p><p>Duan Yan said in a trembling voice.</p><p>At this point, how could they not guess the other party’s goal? that would be really stupid.</p><p>It was obvious that the old man was injured and wanted to use them to recover.</p><p>“Who are you? We are the disciples of Dragon God Valley. If you kill us, the powerhouses of Dragon God Valley will not let you go!”</p><p>Duan Yan shouted.</p><p>“Hehe, Dragon God Valley? I don’t know how many I killed 80000 years ago.”</p><p>The skeletal old man sneered.</p><p>His words made Xu long feel like he had fallen into an ice cellar.</p><p>80,000 years ago, this old man had lived for at least 80000 years.</p><p>It was impossible for a Martial Emperor to live that long. This meant that the old man was a Saint stage powerhouse.</p><p>They had actually encountered a Saint realm expert.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Duan Yan and Fu Xing turned around and ran.</p><p>“Die! Die!”</p><p>The skeletal old man suddenly shouted. Then, a shocking scene appeared.</p><p>Duan Yan’s and Fu Xing’s bodies suddenly stiffened and stopped in the air. Then, they fell down softly, without the slightest trace of vitality.</p><p>The two of them were killed by the old man’s shouts. They did not even see how the old man had attacked. Duan Yan and Fu Xing did not even have any injuries on them.</p><p>Xu Long’s body trembled violently, and he broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, a vast aura rose from the skeletal elder’s body. This aura was as deep as the ocean, as if it was a world, as if it was the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p>It was the aura of a Sage!</p><p>Plop!</p><p>Xu long immediately knelt down and kowtowed like garlic. He begged, ” “Senior, senior, please spare me! As long as senior can spare this Junior’s dog life, this junior will repay senior’s kindness even if I have to go through fire and water, even if I have to work like a cow or a horse!”</p><p>Even Lu Ming was a little speechless. Xu long was so scared of the skeleton elder’s aura that he knelt down and begged for mercy. He did not have the dignity of a warrior at all.</p><p>“Hehe, if you want me to spare you, that’s fine. But relax your mind, I’ll engrave a restriction on your soul. If you obey me completely in the future, I can spare you!”</p><p>The skeletal elder’s aura quickly receded, and his shriveled voice continued.</p><p>Xu Long’s face turned completely pale, and his eyes were filled with unwillingness.</p><p>If the other party were to inscribe a restriction on their soul, then they would have to completely obey the other party for the rest of their lives, becoming their slave.</p><p>However, if he did not agree, the other party was a Sage. Did he not see how Duan Yan and Fu Xing died with a loud shout just now?</p><p>“What’s wrong? I’m telling you, I’m an elder of the evil spirit Holy Church. It’s a great fortune for you to join my cult!”</p><p>The skeletal old man sneered.</p><p>“What? You … You’re an elder of evil spirit?”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Long’s face changed dramatically. His face was filled with endless fear, as if he had heard something extremely terrible.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
