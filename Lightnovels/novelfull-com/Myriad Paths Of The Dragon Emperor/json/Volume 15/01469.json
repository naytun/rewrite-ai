Nianqing and I are already a couple. We’ve been together for so many years. What nonsense are you talking about? ”</p><p>Lu Ming said coldly.</p><p>In the face of such a question, how could Lu Ming avoid it?</p><p>He could tell that these young men had a different opinion of Xie nianqing. Therefore, he would not avoid them. He wanted everyone to know that Xie nianqing was his girlfriend.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Jin Yu shouted and pressed his palm down.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>A huge demonic palm print pressed down on Lu Ming with shocking power.</p><p>Back then, the Feng clan master was also at the peak of the LV 4 martial Royal realm, but his power was much weaker than Jin Yu’s.</p><p>This person was obviously a heaven’s favorite.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered and thrust the long spear in his hand.</p><p>[ thirteen charged strikes ]!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A spear light pierced through the air and stabbed the demonic palm print.</p><p>The four forces at the tip of the spear suddenly burst out with amazing penetrating power. It pierced through the demonic palm print, turning it into demonic Qi and dissipating.</p><p>you’re only at the second level of the martial Royal realm. You have some strength, but you still have to die!</p><p>Jin Yu’s eyes were cold as his aura became stronger and stronger. Demonic Qi started to burn like flames.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>At this moment, a crisp sound was heard.</p><p>Jin Yu was stunned. He turned around and his expression changed. He bowed and said, ” “Jin Yu greets the Holy maiden!”</p><p>“This subordinate pays his respects to the Holy maiden!”</p><p>The two young men from before also bowed.</p><p>“Holy maiden?”</p><p>Lu Ming cast his gaze over.</p><p>A woman stepped through the air.</p><p>She was wearing a long black robe, had a graceful figure, and fair skin. She was very beautiful.</p><p>However, it wasn’t Xie nianqing. It was an unfamiliar woman.</p><p>It was obvious that there was more than one saintess in the Tianyu demonic sect.</p><p>It was normal. Many sects had titles such as Holy maiden, Holy Son, and zongzi. These people were the most talented geniuses of a sect and had the potential to inherit the position of sect leader in the future. However, there would usually be more than one person.</p><p>Some sects had two, three, or even more.</p><p>Each of them was extremely talented and competed with each other. The strongest person would inherit the position of sect master.</p><p>The woman stepped in the air and came to Lu Ming.”What’s going on?”</p><p>Holy Virgin Liu Yu, there’s a lecherous man here who claims to be Holy Virgin nianqing’s boyfriend. I’m going to kill him!</p><p>Jin Yu said respectfully.</p><p>Although his cultivation was not bad, he was still very respectful and fearful in front of Liu Yu.</p><p>“Nianqing’s boyfriend? Interesting!”</p><p>Liu Yu’s eyes flickered and the corners of her mouth curled into an inexplicable smile. She looked at Lu Ming and said,”Are you really nianqing’s boyfriend?”</p><p>that’s right. Whether it’s true or not, you’ll know once you see nianqing!</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>alright, I’ll believe you this time. But you have to know that if you lie, the Tian Yu demon sect will be your burial ground!</p><p>Liu Yu’s eyes revealed a hint of killing intent.</p><p>I’m just a mere second level Martial Emperor. How could I have such courage? ”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll take you to nianqing!”</p><p>Liu Yu said.</p><p>“Holy maiden …”</p><p>Jin Yu’s expression changed.</p><p>“Shut up. Do you have any objections to my decision?”</p><p>Liu Yu coldly glanced at Jin Yu, causing him to break out in a cold sweat. He quickly lowered his head and did not dare to speak.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Liu Yu took light steps and stepped into the air as she headed toward the depths of the Tian Yu demon sect. Lu Ming followed behind her.</p><p>Along the way, some people looked at Lu Ming in surprise. However, when they saw that the person leading the way was Liu Yu, no one said anything.</p><p>After crossing one demon mountain after another, the demonic Qi in front of them was getting thicker and thicker.</p><p>Very quickly, they arrived at an incomparably huge demonic mountain and landed in front of a huge Palace.</p><p>“This place is nianqing’s residence!”</p><p>Liu Yu said.</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>He had not seen Xie nianqing for more than half a year.</p><p>He wondered how she was doing after they parted ways in the divine Ruins continent.</p><p>“Holy Virgin Liu Yu, may I know why you’ve come?”</p><p>A middle-aged woman appeared in front of Liu Yu and bowed slightly.</p><p>“Please pass on a message that an old friend is here to see nianqing!”</p><p>Liu Yu said in a tender voice.</p><p>“An old friend?”</p><p>“Is this the person?” the middle-aged woman looked at Lu Ming.</p><p>that’s right. This is young master Lu Ming. He said that he is nianqing’s boyfriend!</p><p>Liu Yu said with a smile.</p><p>“The saint’s boyfriend?”</p><p>The middle-aged woman’s expression changed. a mere second level martial Royal realm, Holy maiden Liu Yu. Did you make a mistake? ”</p><p>this is the Tian Yu demon sect. I don’t think he would dare to lie. Whether it’s right or wrong, just let nianqing come out and see!</p><p>Liu Yu said.</p><p>The middle-aged woman’s eyes flickered. She pondered for a moment and said,”Alright, I’ll inform the Saint!”</p><p>After saying that, the middle-aged woman turned around and walked into the palace.</p><p>After a while, a figure flashed out of the hall and appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming, is it really you?”</p><p>A surprised voice was heard.</p><p>An alluring figure stood in front of Lu Ming and looked at him carefully.</p><p>“Nianqing!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a smile on his face.</p><p>After more than half a year, he finally saw Xie nianqing in the yuan continent.</p><p>After more than half a year, Xie nianqing was still as beautiful as ever. In fact, the demonic glow on his body was even more intense. He looked like he had a unique charm that could make one’s heart beat faster with just one look.</p><p>Although Liu Yu was equally beautiful, when she stood next to Xie nianqing, she couldn’t hold a candle to him. The distance between them widened, and everyone’s eyes naturally shifted from Liu Yu to Xie nianqing.</p><p>Liu Yu’s eyes flashed with jealousy, but she still smiled. Junior Sister nianqing, this man said he’s your boyfriend. It seems he’s not lying!</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Xie nianqing nodded.</p><p>“Hehehe, then I must congratulate Junior Sister nianqing. But Senior Sister is a little strange. Your boyfriend’s cultivation is too low. He’s only at the second level of the Martial Emperor realm …”</p><p>At this point, Liu Yu stopped. There was a hint of mockery in her tone.</p><p>“In my heart, Lu Ming’s talent is much stronger than yours. It won’t be long before he surpasses you. Alright, Senior Sister, please leave!”</p><p>Xie nianqing’s voice was cold, as if he was on bad terms with Liu Yu.</p><p>“Hehehe, Junior Sister, I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>Liu Yu smiled and left.</p><p>“Lu Ming, come with me!”</p><p>Xie nianqing pulled Lu Ming’s hand and entered the hall.</p><p>Behind the hall, there was an elegant courtyard. Xie nianqing leaned on Lu Ming’s shoulder. Lu Ming wrapped his arm around Xie nianqing’s waist and kissed his red lips.</p><p>The scene was filled with warmth!</p><p>After a long time, their lips separated!</p><p>The two of them snuggled up to each other and told each other their hearts.</p><p>“Little Qing, how did you become the Saint of the Tian Yu demon sect?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
