Could she be bubbles ‘mother, the legendary space-time spirit mouse?</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>However, he was also happy for bubbles. Looking at eggy’s appearance, the time and space spinel must be extraordinary.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>Bubbles cried out as her entire body emitted a milky white light. That light seemed both real and illusionary, as if space-time laws had enveloped her entire body. She looked at dandan with a smug expression.</p><p>This made dandan so angry that even her turtle shell turned green.</p><p>“Dandan, who is that person? It’s that powerful?”</p><p>Lu Ming asked curiously.</p><p>Lu Ming speculated that the figure should be an existence at the same stage as dandan. It might even be an expert of the same level. Could it be another one of the top ten beasts?</p><p>“Who else could it be? Just look at its size, it’s one of the top ten Battle Beasts, the Titan Longhorn. It was my little brother back then!”</p><p>Dandan curled her lips and said.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart skipped a beat and he looked shocked.</p><p>He had come into contact with a few of the top ten warbeasts.</p><p>His first bloodline, the nine Dragons!</p><p>There was also dandan, who called herself the divine turtle of the world and the head of the top ten. Of course, Lu Ming only heard it and did not take it seriously.</p><p>Bubbles was the descendant of the space-time spirit mouse.</p><p>There was also the Dragon Star’s bloodline, the Archean dragonesque elephant.</p><p>However, none of the people he had come into contact with were the original. They either appeared with the bloodline or were descendants. And dandan had also gone through Nirvana and rebirth.</p><p>As for the Titan longhorn beetle, it was the real original body. Although it was said that it wasn’t in its peak state and had been injured, the real original body, the legendary one, had earth-shaking combat strength.</p><p>As for dandan’s statement that the Titan Longhorn was his younger brother, Lu Ming directly ignored it. Dandan would die if she did not boast.</p><p>“How many of the top ten Battle Beasts are still alive?”</p><p>Lu Ming muttered.</p><p>There was no doubt that the top ten warbeasts were the pinnacle of existence in the world. Each of them was forbidden, unique, and unique.</p><p>The old space-time spirit rat had died, and a new space-time spirit rat was born.</p><p>“I don’t know either!”</p><p>Dandan’s expression revealed a rare look of contemplation and solemness, as if she was sighing with emotion.</p><p>Chirping …</p><p>At this moment, with a cry from Pao Pao, one of its claws pointed forward.</p><p>Lu Ming looked ahead.</p><p>“Mo he!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>The mountain they had appeared on wasn’t far from the desolate land of death.</p><p>From afar, one could see the pitch-black River.</p><p>Mo he stood by the river with his hands behind his back, looking at the desolate land of death.</p><p>“Hmph, I have to think of a way to get rid of this person!”</p><p>Lu Ming revealed a cold murderous intent.</p><p>This time, he was lucky to have survived. It could be said that he was in danger. Lu Ming must take revenge.</p><p>“There it is!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes flickered and Ming Lian appeared.</p><p>Lu Ming’s plan was very simple. He would let Ming Lian inscribe a large array to trap mo he.</p><p>Ming Lian took a step forward and appeared in a Valley behind the mountain. He began to carve a large array.</p><p>“This Lord will help!”</p><p>Dandan followed him. How could he miss out on such a thing as scamming and killing people?</p><p>As for Lu Ming himself, he concealed his aura and quietly approached the big River.</p><p>The river was very long, and it divided the land into two. One side was the desolate land of death, and the other side was normal land.</p><p>Lu Ming quietly came to the river and hid himself with the help of a huge rock. He was a hundred miles away from mo he.</p><p>Lu Ming completely restrained his aura and observed quietly.</p><p>“I wonder how that kid is doing? Are you dead?”</p><p>Mo he looked at the wasteland of death and thought with a frown.</p><p>“I hope those guys can kill that kid and bring his body out!”</p><p>This time, he had been ordered to kill Lu Ming. He was confident that he would bring Lu Ming’s corpse back. He did not expect that Lu Ming would escape and escape to the death wasteland.</p><p>He didn’t dare to enter and could only wait here.</p><p>Time passed by quickly!</p><p>Very quickly, a day had passed.</p><p>“Why aren’t they out yet? did they all die inside?”</p><p>the desolate land of death is full of dangers. Even the experts of the Saint realm will die if they go in. A great emperor once went in and came out with a serious expression. It’s definitely dangerous inside. That brat has been in there for so long. He probably won’t survive. I’ll wait for one more day. After one day, I’ll go back and report!</p><p>Mo he thought with a frown.</p><p>Another day passed quickly.</p><p>it seems that this kid has died inside. Let’s go back!</p><p>Mo he turned around and stepped on the air, planning to leave.</p><p>As for the five seventh level martial Royal realm martial artists, they were just like ants in his eyes. He did not care about them at all.</p><p>“You’re leaving? The time is still too short, but the great formation that has been inscribed for two days should be able to kill this person!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>Then, he circulated his essential core and his body trembled. He spat out a mouthful of blood. Following that, Lu Ming struck a huge rock at the side with his palm, causing it to explode with a loud boom.</p><p>In the distance, mo he, who was about to leave, was successfully alarmed and looked over.</p><p>“Lu Ming, you’re not dead!”</p><p>Mo he’s eyes widened as he roared.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered with mo he. He pretended that he had just rushed out of the desolate land of death and was seriously injured. He flew wildly into the distance.</p><p>“You want to run? die!”</p><p>Mo he shouted angrily and turned into a ray of demonic light, chasing after Lu Ming at top speed.</p><p>Black wings appeared on Lu Ming’s back. With a flap, he flew toward the mountain peak like lightning.</p><p>When they were about to reach, Lu Ming dashed into the canyon.</p><p>As for his second body and dandan, they had already hidden themselves.</p><p>Mo he did not doubt him. He followed Lu Ming and rushed into the valley.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Why aren’t you running? Do you know that you can’t escape? Where are the few from my Tian Yu demon sect?”</p><p>Mo he coldly spoke.</p><p>“Those good-for-nothings are all dead!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled faintly.</p><p>you’re indeed a piece of trash. You can’t even kill a Lv 2 martial Royal realm ant like you. You deserve to die!</p><p>Mo he said coldly. The demonic Qi on his body rolled and pressed toward Lu Ming.</p><p>“Ants? Then, I’ll show you the counterattack of an ant!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled coldly and took a step forward.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>The entire Canyon was filled with dense inscriptions, and a large array appeared.</p><p>“Killing formation, you … You came out long ago?”</p><p>As soon as the formation was out, mo he’s expression changed drastically. He finally understood that Lu Ming had come out long ago and set up the formation here to lure him here.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Lu Ming could not be bothered to talk nonsense with him. He shouted.</p><p>In the depths of the canyon, Ming Lian waved his hands, and the formation lit up. Endless sword radiance condensed and charged toward mo he.</p><p>“You want to kill me with a formation? in your dreams! Break!”</p><p>Mo he let out a long roar, and the demonic Qi on his body soared to the sky. Vaguely, he seemed to see a demonic god roaring at the sky.</p><p>His demonic domain combined with his spiritual body and released demonic blades that destroyed the sword rays that were coming at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
