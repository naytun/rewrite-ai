This power was like an avalanche or an ancient divine mountain crashing into his finger.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>His fingers made a cracking sound and were deformed.</p><p>He bellowed in rage and retreated rapidly. He took more than ten steps back and looked at Lu Ming with a sinister expression.</p><p>In the previous move, Lu Ming had broken the bones of his fingers with one punch.</p><p>He glanced at Lu Ming with a serious look in his eyes. He did not continue to attack. Instead, he dashed toward one of the Emperor spiritual weapons. His territory spread out and enveloped the sword.</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming made his move. With a wave of his hand, the chaos Domain spread and suppressed the two King spiritual weapons in the chaos Domain before he put them away.</p><p>“Could this place be a treasure vault?”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes swept across the sky. Looking at the lights that were flying randomly in the sky, a thought flashed across his mind.</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ming attacked again without any hesitation.</p><p>There were more than ten young men present, and all of them had powerful cultivation. If he were to delay any longer, he would most likely not be able to get a share.</p><p>Buzzzzzz! &Nbsp; Whoosh!…</p><p>More than a dozen young men attacked at an extremely fast speed. The light dancing in the sky became less and less as they put away the king spiritual weapons.</p><p>Within a short period of time, Lu Ming had obtained eight Emperor spiritual weapons.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>In the sky, two people began to fight again. It was two young men fighting over a Saint weapon. However, the two of them were afraid of each other, so when they saw the Saint weapon fly away, they stopped and chased after it.</p><p>Soon, the king weapons were almost all collected. Only a few Saint weapons and a few Jade boxes were left in the sky.</p><p>The Jade boxes were the fastest, and they streaked across the sky like lightning bolts.</p><p>Buzzzzzz!</p><p>Lu Ming soared into the sky and pounced on a holy weapon.</p><p>This holy weapon was a jade bangle that was filled with demonic Qi.</p><p>Lu Ming thought of Xie nianqing. This jade bangle was very suitable to be given to Xie nianqing.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Lu Ming was not the only one who had his eyes on the Jade bangle. Two other young men were also interested in it.</p><p>One of them was the demonic-looking young man who had attacked Lu Ming earlier. The other person was dressed in a green robe and had an evil smile on his face.</p><p>The green-robed young man made a grabbing motion and streams of green mist spread towards Lu Ming.</p><p>As soon as the mist appeared, a disgusting smell filled the air.</p><p>Poisonous gas!</p><p>This poisonous gas was extremely poisonous!</p><p>However, Lu Ming was least afraid of poison.</p><p>The devouring power covered Lu Ming’s entire body. He ignored the green mist and rushed past it. Then, he struck his palm at the green-robed young man.</p><p>The green-robed young man did not expect Lu Ming to completely ignore the poisonous gas. His expression changed and with a wave of his hand, a group of densely packed poisonous insects appeared in front of him. The poisonous insects formed a shield in front of him.</p><p>Lu Ming’s palm struck down and a large number of poisonous insects exploded. The young man in green trembled and retreated dozens of meters.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Then, Lu Ming’s leg swept out like a steel whip toward the demonic-looking young man, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>Lu Ming’s right hand reached out and caught the Jade bangle.</p><p>&Nbsp; Weng Weng Weng!</p><p>The Jade bangle in Lu Ming’s hand was still vibrating non-stop.</p><p>“What a strong spiritual property!”</p><p>Lu Ming was overjoyed.</p><p>The stronger the spirituality of a holy weapon, the higher its grade and the more precious it was.</p><p>For example, Lu Ming’s Thunder cauldron and air-frozen bead definitely had extraordinary sounds.</p><p>“Hand over your Saint weapon and I’ll spare your life!”</p><p>The green-robed young man said as he stared at Lu Ming coldly.</p><p>“If you want to die, come here!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s simple reply was extremely domineering.</p><p>The green-robed young man’s face was gloomy, and his body was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>He was the leader of the Yu Du sect, one of the thirteen top forces that had entered the great emperor secret realm. He was powerful and skilled in using poison. Even the leaders of the other sects were wary of him.</p><p>Now, Lu Ming actually dared to speak to him in this manner.</p><p>You’re looking for death!</p><p>He had already sentenced Lu Ming to death in his heart.</p><p>“Ten thousand poison bloodthirsty!”</p><p>die! the green-robed young man shouted coldly and pounced at Lu Ming. He waved his palm and a dense swarm of poisonous insects appeared. These poisonous insects had a hard shell on their bodies and kept spewing poisonous gas from their mouths.</p><p>What was even more amazing was that these poisonous insects were actually grouping up. Countless poisonous insects formed a combat weapon and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>In the air, more than ten combat weapons suddenly appeared. They were all made up of poisonous insects, and they were either combat swords or combat sabers …</p><p>The similarity was that each of them was filled with poison.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Lu Ming opened his palm and the terrifying devouring power enveloped all the poisonous insects.</p><p>The devouring power burst forth and the dense poisonous gas was instantly absorbed by Lu Ming. The poisonous insects were also sucked dry of their blood essence in an instant. Their blood fell to the ground like raindrops.</p><p>“What a powerful poisonous gas!”</p><p>After devouring so much poisonous gas, Lu Ming felt that his body was slightly numb.</p><p>Lu Ming could not help but sigh at the power of this poisonous gas.</p><p>This was the first time that Lu Ming’s body felt numb from being poisoned.</p><p>In the past, any poisonous gas that was devoured by Lu Ming’s devouring power would be refined and would not affect him at all.</p><p>“This is the yuan continent after all …”</p><p>This poisonous gas also gave Lu Ming a reminder. After all, this was the yuan continent, not the continent group of the divine Ruins. The laws of heaven and earth were complete, and everything in the world was different from the continent group of the divine Ruins. It was possible that some terrifying poisonous gas was born, and even the devouring power could not devour it.</p><p>Lu Ming warned himself that he could not be careless when facing poisonous gas in the future.</p><p>Of course, the green-robed young man’s poisonous gas was nothing to Lu Ming. It only numbed Lu Ming’s body slightly before it was refined by the refining power.</p><p>“You …”</p><p>The green-robed young man looked at Lu Ming in disbelief. His poisonous gas had been devoured by Lu Ming. How was this possible?</p><p>Even an expert with a much higher cultivation than him would not dare to face his poison head-on, let alone devour it into his body.</p><p>“You want to use this little bit of poisonous gas to poison people? What a joke!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled indifferently and took a step forward. The terrifying chaos realm pressed toward the green-robed young man.</p><p>The green-robed youth’s expression changed drastically as he tried his best to block.</p><p>However, his poisonous gas had lost its power and his combat strength was much weaker than the other leaders. He was crushed by Lu Ming’s Chaos Domain and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body flew far away and many of his bone armor had been broken.</p><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><p>At this moment, the battle for the Holy weapon had entered a state of white heat.</p><p>More than a dozen young men were fighting over a few Saint weapons.</p><p>In the end, the Saint weapons were taken away by different people.</p><p>Luo Xiang of the life and death Sword sect had become even more powerful after receiving the inheritance of the sword way. His sword Qi broke through the air and cut through everything, seizing a holy weapon.</p><p>Shi Tian of the tianshen sect also obtained a holy weapon like a god.</p><p>He Yu of Dragon God Valley had the blood Dragon combat body, which was extremely powerful. He had also obtained a Saint weapon.</p><p>This made the other young men green with envy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
