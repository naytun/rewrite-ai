I wonder what level this Dragon Bone can evolve my Dragon God combat body to? ”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart was burning. After putting away the Dragon bones, he did not delay and returned to Cloud Dragon Valley.</p><p>...</p><p>After entering the cave abode, Lu Ming first watered the path-understanding ancient tree with five kilograms of myriad spirit liquid. Then, he sat cross-legged and with a thought, the Dragon Bone appeared in front of Lu Ming.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The Dragon Bone was sparkling and translucent, and a Dragon’s Roar could be faintly heard. It exuded a powerful spiritual essence.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes brightened. A powerful devouring force emanated from his body and enveloped the Dragon Bone. In an instant, wisps of essence from the Dragon Bone flew toward Lu Ming like tiny true dragons and entered his body.</p><p>Lu Ming circulated the true war Dragon technique, the cultivation technique of the Dragon God combat body. He began to absorb and refine the essence to temper his spirit body.</p><p>Just like that, time passed by day by day.</p><p>As time passed, the Dragon Bone grew smaller and the light on it dimmed. Lu Ming’s body was surrounded by a layer of divine light.</p><p>Lu Ming’s spirit body was undergoing a transformation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p>Kachaa!</p><p>A crack appeared on the Dragon Bone, and with a final bang, it turned into a pile of powder. There was no longer any spiritual essence on it.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>At this moment, a deafening Dragon’s Roar came from Lu Ming’s body. The shadow of Nine Dragons appeared and circled around him. After a while, it burrowed into Lu Ming’s body and disappeared.</p><p>The muscles all over Lu Ming’s body squirmed and his bones cracked. After a moment, he calmed down.</p><p>Hu!</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming let out a long breath and opened his eyes.</p><p>medium grade earth spiritual body!</p><p>Lu Ming felt the strong power in his body and a thought flashed across his mind.</p><p>Medium-grade earth spiritual body. Lu Ming’s spirit body had successfully completed its evolution and had achieved a medium-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>This was a qualitative transformation, from a low grade earth spiritual body to a medium grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>If others knew about this, it would probably cause a huge uproar.</p><p>The intrinsic level of a spirit body was very difficult to improve.</p><p>An ordinary Martial Emperor would temper their spirit body while improving their cultivation. As their cultivation increased, their spirit body would become stronger as well.</p><p>However, this kind of increase in strength was only a quantitative increase.</p><p>For example, if a warrior with a low-grade earth spiritual body improved his cultivation, the power and effect of his spiritual body would also become stronger. However, he would still be a low-grade earth spiritual body. This was his nature and would not change.</p><p>From a low-grade earth spiritual body to a medium-grade earth spiritual body, this was an improvement in essence.</p><p>Lu Ming had completed the upgrade of the essence. The higher the essence level of the spirit body, the more powerful it would be. Moreover, when the cultivation level increased, the extent of the improvement of the spirit body would also be greater.</p><p>It was extremely difficult for a spirit body to improve its essence.</p><p>There were very few ways to increase one’s intrinsic quality.</p><p>Just like Di Yi, he had obtained the cultivation method of the myriad spirit body by chance. It was a method that could improve the nature of the spirit body, but it was also very difficult. It required the blood and essence of thousands of creatures.</p><p>Di Yi had spent 10000 years to no avail. Once he succeeded, his spiritual body would evolve into a low-grade spiritual body.</p><p>It was said that in the yuan continent, there were some heavenly treasures that could also allow a spirit body to undergo a qualitative change. However, each of these heavenly treasures was extremely rare and priceless.</p><p>a Dragon Bone worth two million contribution points can only be upgraded from a low-tier earth spiritual body to a medium-tier earth spiritual body. I wonder how many resources I’ll need to upgrade it in the future!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed.</p><p>He was originally looking forward to raising his earth spiritual body to a superior earth spiritual body, but it seemed like an extravagant hope.</p><p>The resources and dragon essence required to upgrade the Dragon God combat body were much more than he had imagined. Moreover, the further he advanced, the more dragon essence he would need.</p><p>The amount of dragon essence needed to advance from a medium-grade earth spiritual body to a superior-grade earth spiritual body was ten times more than the amount needed to advance from a low-grade earth spiritual body to a medium-grade earth spiritual body.</p><p>After that, it would be an even more astronomical figure to raise it to the heavenly spiritual body.</p><p>Lu Ming had a headache just thinking about it.</p><p>I’ll take it slow. After my cultivation improves, I’ll just go out and take risks to earn orirocks and contribution points!</p><p>Lu Ming had this plan.</p><p>Then, Lu Ming continued to cultivate, comprehending the thirteen momentum-storing strikes and the chaos sky-turning seal.</p><p>The chaos sky-turning seal, like other domain-level martial arts techniques, was divided into six levels. Lu Ming had only cultivated to the first level and was about to break through to the second level.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, another ten days had passed. Lu Ming had joined Cloud Dragon Valley for more than a month.</p><p>After ten days of bitter cultivation, the chaos sky-turning seal had successfully reached the second level. Lu Ming had also reached the second level of the [ storing power thirteen strikes ].</p><p>A casual swing of the spear could contain four streams of power, and the power was astonishing.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming received a message. He had a mission.</p><p>It was a mission given to him by Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Normally, the sect would assign a mission to new disciples within three months.</p><p>Lu Ming flew out of Dragon God Valley according to the mission’s instructions. A few people were already waiting on a small Snow Mountain.</p><p>These few people had the same mission as Lu Ming.</p><p>“You are Lu Ming!”</p><p>Lu Ming landed and some of them recognized him.</p><p>When Lu Ming had first joined Dragon God Valley, he had caused a huge commotion. The valley Masters of Silver Dragon Valley and cloud Dragon Valley had come in person. In the end, the valley master of Cloud Dragon Valley had even accepted Lu Ming as his disciple.</p><p>Back then, many people had watched the show. It was normal for some of them to recognize Lu Ming.</p><p>“How should I address you?”</p><p>Lu Ming cupped his fists and swept his gaze across the room.</p><p>Other than Lu Ming, there were four other people. One of them was a brawny man in his thirties. He had a burly figure and a head of inch-long hair. His aura was the most threatening.</p><p>The other three people were slightly younger. Two of them were young men in their twenties, and one of them was a young woman in her twenties. They had hot figures and curvaceous bodies.</p><p>“I’m xu long!”</p><p>The buzz cut man introduced himself.</p><p>Then, the other three also introduced themselves.</p><p>The two young men were Zhang Kong and Fu Xing.</p><p>The young woman was called Duan Yan.</p><p>The few of them did not hide their cultivation. Lu Ming scanned them with his spiritual senses and they were clear of their cultivation.</p><p>Xu Long’s cultivation was the strongest, at the peak Lv 3 martial Royal realm.</p><p>Fu Xing and Duan Yan were both at the LV 3 martial Royal realm. One of them was at the early stage of Lv 3, while the other was at the late stage.</p><p>Zhang Kong, on the other hand, was at the peak of the second level martial Royal realm.</p><p>Lu Ming was the weakest at the peak of the first level Martial Emperor realm.</p><p>I believe that everyone is aware of our mission. The Feng family of the six Kong mountain is a subsidiary family of Dragon God Valley. Some time ago, the Feng family’s master was mysteriously killed, and the Feng family couldn’t find any clues. A few days later, the second master of the Feng family was also killed mysteriously. The Feng family panicked and asked for help from Dragon God Valley!</p><p>“Our mission this time is to find out the cause of death of the head of the Feng family and the second master of the Feng family, as well as find the murderer and ensure the safety of the Feng family!”</p><p>Xu long briefly explained the mission.</p><p>Lu Ming and the rest nodded. They had seen this mission before.</p><p>“Alright, let’s set off now!”</p><p>Xu long said.</p><p>The group rose into the air and flew toward the Feng family of the six Kong mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
