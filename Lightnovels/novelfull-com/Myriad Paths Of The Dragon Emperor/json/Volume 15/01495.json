That was why he made the bet with him.</p><p>“How about five hundred thousand sect contribution points?”</p><p>...</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>“500000 sect contribution points!”</p><p>The silver-robed young man’s heart trembled. Then, his eyes burst into flames and revealed a greedy look, ” “Alright, I agree!”</p><p>“Junior brothers, senior brothers, please be our witnesses!” The silver-robed youth called out.</p><p>The silver-robed young man shouted, and the young men who were watching from below the stone platform looked over. Some of them walked over.</p><p>The few people who were with the silver-robed youth also walked over.</p><p>“What witness?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“Everyone, this person is called Lu Ming!”</p><p>The silver-robed young man pointed at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Lu Ming? So it’s him!”</p><p>“He is Lu Ming!”</p><p>Some people blurted out.</p><p>Lu Ming was very famous now. At the entrance of Cloud Dragon Valley, he had killed Yin Feng in front of the master of Silver Dragon Valley and injured him. Later on, the master of Cloud Dragon Valley had even killed several deacons of the hall of missions. This had shocked the entire Dragon God Valley.</p><p>All of this was because of Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming’s name became well-known to many people.</p><p>At that moment, they all looked at Lu Ming curiously.</p><p>Junior Brother Lu Ming, you want to make a bet with me. You want to bet on who will get to the higher stone platform. The bet is five hundred thousand contribution points. Is that right, Junior Brother Lu Ming? ”</p><p>The silver-robed youth asked.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The others were shocked by his words. They looked at Lu Ming in disbelief.</p><p>Lu Ming actually wanted to make a bet with the silver-robed young man, and the bet was five hundred thousand contribution points.</p><p>With Lu Ming’s cultivation base, he would definitely lose in a bet with the silver-robed young man.</p><p>The stone-stepping platform did not judge one’s combat strength, but one’s territory.</p><p>The higher the level of the domain, the more powerful it was, and the higher the platform could be.</p><p>Did Lu Ming have so many contribution points that he had nowhere to use them?</p><p>The corners of Lu Ming’s lips curled up slightly. The silver-robed young man was afraid that Lu Ming would go back on his word, so he had gathered these people to bear witness. However, this was exactly what Lu Ming wanted.</p><p>“Yes, that’s true!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>“Alright, Lu Ming has agreed. We can be witnesses!”</p><p>A young man who was with the silver-robed young man was the first to shout.</p><p>The others also nodded, indicating that they could bear witness.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu Ming, let’s start!”</p><p>The silver-robed youth said, somewhat impatient, afraid that a long night would bring more trouble.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Lu Ming smiled.</p><p>The two of them chose two stone platforms that were close to each other. These stone platforms kept going up, and there was no one else.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The two of them jumped onto the first stone platform almost at the same time. Then, they sat down cross-legged at the same time. The stone platform glowed and dense inscriptions appeared, covering the two of them.</p><p>The first function of this inscription was to allow one’s mind to escape into the unfathomable void. The second function was to prevent others from attacking. It had a defensive function.</p><p>Although there was a rule in Dragon God Valley that no one was allowed to attack others on the floating platform, or they would be severely punished, there might be people who would take the risk. Therefore, this inscription played a very good defensive role.</p><p>When the runes covered Lu Ming’s entire body, he felt that his spirit, or rather, his soul, had been drawn out of his body.</p><p>The space around him flitted past like a fleeting shadow. In the next moment, Lu Ming realized that he had arrived at a land of chaos.</p><p>The surroundings were vast and boundless.</p><p>However, Lu Ming realized that the aura of the great Dao here was extremely rich. If he cultivated here, the effects would be at least ten times better.</p><p>is this the battlefield of the heavenly law created by the ancestors of Dragon God Valley? ”</p><p>Lu Ming pondered in his heart.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Suddenly, there was a loud roar. In front of them, a strange beast appeared. This strange beast was filled with the aura of the great Dao.</p><p>“Heavenly way mutant beast!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s heart stirred.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Following that, loud roars were heard one after another as heavenly path mutant beasts formed one after another.</p><p>These heavenly Dao beasts came in different forms. Some were in the form of a Tiger, some were in the form of a Wolf, and some were in the form of a snake …</p><p>All of them had a golden mark on their foreheads.</p><p>“Heavenly Dao imprint!”</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with a bright light.</p><p>In the heaven path battlefield, as long as this kind of strange beast was killed, the mark of heaven path between its eyebrows would be absorbed by the warrior. He could directly comprehend the heaven path and comprehend the domain. It was extremely wonderful.</p><p>With a series of loud roars, at least five or six beasts of the heavenly law pounced at Lu Ming.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>The chaos Domain spread out and began to shrink. Finally, it turned into a long spear that Lu Ming held in his hand.</p><p>In the heavenly law battlefield, all weapons and vital essence couldn’t be used because one’s mind was in it. The only thing that could be used was the territory.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>He thrust his spear forward, and a beam of spear light streaked across the vast space, killing a heavenly path mutant beast.</p><p>Then, the spear swept across, and five or six beasts of heavenly law were defeated at the same time.</p><p>The heavenly way mutant beasts were defeated and dissipated into heavenly way energy. However, the heavenly way mark between their brows emitted a golden glow and flew into Lu Ming’s body before disappearing.</p><p>Roar! Roar! Roar!</p><p>Their roars were like thunder. More heavenly path mutant beasts appeared and charged at Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming held the spear condensed by the chaos Domain and charged forward. With a shake of the spear, more than ten spear shadows streaked across the sky, killing more than ten beasts of the heavenly way.</p><p>This was the first floating platform. The heavenly way exotic beast that appeared had the power of a first-level territory. To Lu Ming, it was not difficult at all.</p><p>Very soon, Lu Ming had killed a total of 108 beasts of the heavenly way, but no more beasts appeared.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming felt his body tighten. The next moment, he realized that he had returned to his physical body on the sky-connecting floating platform.</p><p>“Yes, the heavenly Dao imprint!”</p><p>Lu Ming sensed and realized that there were 108 golden heavenly Dao marks in his mind.</p><p>amazing, this is really amazing!</p><p>Lu Ming sighed with emotion.</p><p>Then, he closed his eyes and refined these heavenly path imprints. His body began to emit a faint golden radiance.</p><p>On the floating platform next to Lu Ming, the silver-robed young man opened his eyes and glanced at Lu Ming. He sneered and began to refine the heavenly Dao mark.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the silver-robed young man stood up, and the runes covering his body automatically retreated and disappeared.</p><p>The silver-robed young man cast a disdainful look at Lu Ming, who was still refining. He took a step forward and crossed a hundred meters. He appeared on the second floating platform and sat cross-legged.</p><p>At the same time, dense runes appeared on the second floating platform and enveloped his body.</p><p>Lu Ming continued to stay on the first floating platform.</p><p>Half an hour later, Lu Ming felt that the heavenly Dao mark that he had just obtained had been completely refined.</p><p>the chaos Domain has indeed strengthened by a notch. It’s comparable to seven days of bitter cultivation!</p><p>A smile appeared on Lu Ming’s face. He was shocked by the effect of the sky-high floating platform.</p><p>All the time he had just spent did not even add up to an hour, but the effect was comparable to a normal seven days of bitter cultivation. Such an effect was indeed shocking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
