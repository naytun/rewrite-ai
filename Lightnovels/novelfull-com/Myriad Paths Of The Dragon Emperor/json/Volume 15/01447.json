They were from the same sect, but he kept trying to kill Lu Ming by selling him out.</p><p>...</p><p>Beside he Yu, Yin Feng sneered.</p><p>hehe, even the Dragon God Valley disciple has spoken. It seems to be true!</p><p>The sage realm expert of the heavenly God sect sneered, and his aura became stronger.</p><p>I’ve already said that I didn’t obtain Emperor Cang’s inheritance!</p><p>Lu Ming spoke again, his gaze sweeping across Shi Tian, mo Jie, he Yu, and the others.</p><p>Speaking of which, Lu Ming was the one who saved them this time. If not for Lu Ming, these people would have been killed by Shakyamuni annihilating soul after entering the core of Emperor Cang’s bedchamber. His flesh and blood would have been refined and everyone would have died.</p><p>But now, these people wanted to kill Lu Ming.</p><p>Lu Ming would remember these people one by one. There would be a time to settle this score in the future.</p><p>“Words are not proof, we want to test it!”</p><p>The sage realm expert of the heavenly God sect coldly spoke.</p><p>if you want to test it, then test it. The tianshen sect is so overbearing. Do you think my Dragon God Valley sect will be afraid? ”</p><p>Elder Hong was very powerful. His aura was violent, like a true dragon.</p><p>The confrontation between the two Saint stage powerhouses made many young men’s faces turn pale. It was as if a mountain was pressing on their hearts, and they felt so uncomfortable that they wanted to vomit blood.</p><p>Lu Ming was better off. He had seen the terrifying auras of the two great emperors. Although the auras of the sages were strong, they could not move his heart.</p><p>“Lu Ming, did you really enter Emperor Cang’s bedchamber?”</p><p>Elder Hong asked Lu Ming.</p><p>Everyone’s eyes were on Lu Ming, waiting to see how he would answer.</p><p>“That’s right, I entered the core of Emperor Cang’s bedroom!”</p><p>Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>it seems that others didn’t slander you. You’ve admitted it yourself!</p><p>The sage expert of the heavenly God sect said.</p><p>“Entering the core of Emperor Cang’s bedchamber might not necessarily mean that you have obtained the legacy. Lu Ming, what did you see in the core of Emperor Cang’s bedchamber? What did you do?”</p><p>Elder Hong asked again.</p><p>“I saw Emperor Cang!”</p><p>Lu Ming said.</p><p>His words were like a sudden clap of thunder, exploding in everyone’s mind.</p><p>Everyone looked at Lu Ming in shock.</p><p>Lu Ming had met Emperor Cang?</p><p>Could it be that Emperor Cang was not dead?</p><p>“Is Emperor Cang still alive?”</p><p>The sage of the tianshen sect asked, his voice a little hoarse.</p><p>“Yes, Emperor Cang is still alive!” Lu Ming nodded.</p><p>Hiss hiss hiss …</p><p>Gasps of shock could be heard.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Emperor Cang was still alive. The world of the Azure continent was going to undergo a huge change.</p><p>if Emperor Cang is alive, why hasn’t there been any trace of him for sixty thousand years? ”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>“That’s right. Lu Ming, speak clearly. What did you see? What did you get?”</p><p>Someone asked.</p><p>the reason why Emperor Cang has disappeared for sixty thousand years is because he was severely injured. Furthermore, he has been confronting a great enemy for sixty thousand years …</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ming did not hide anything and told him what he saw in full detail.</p><p>However, he had made a slight change.</p><p>In fact, Shakyamuni annihilating soul had the upper hand. However, Lu Ming said that Emperor Cang and Shakyamuni annihilating soul were equal. After confronting each other for 60000 years, Emperor Cang finally gained the upper hand with the help of his Thunder cauldron. He wanted to suppress Shakyamuni annihilating soul.</p><p>Shakyamuni soul! It’s actually Shakyamuni soul …</p><p>Shakyamuni annihilating soul is still alive? ”</p><p>The Saint realm powerhouses present seemed to have heard of Shakyamuni annihilating soul before. While they were shocked, their expressions were extremely grave.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>Many people who had never heard of Shakyamuni annihilating soul were shocked.</p><p>They finally knew why Emperor Cang suddenly disappeared 60000 years ago. It was because he had encountered a great enemy.</p><p>Many of the young men who had entered the secret realm were even more moved. They recalled the many skeletons they had seen in the great emperor secret realm. Clearly, they were all killed by Emperor Cang’s enemies.</p><p>Emperor Cang borrowed my holy weapon, the Thunder cauldron, and brought Shakyamuni annihilating soul into the infinite void. He said that he would return the Thunder cauldron to thank me for my help after he had completely suppressed Shakyamuni annihilating soul!</p><p>In the end, Lu Ming said this.</p><p>The meaning of his words was very simple. Emperor Cang was still alive and he did not receive Emperor Cang’s inheritance. Furthermore, he was Emperor Cang’s benefactor. After Emperor Cang suppressed the enemy, he would return to find him.</p><p>He was using Emperor Cang’s name to intimidate the experts from the other sects.</p><p>If they touched Lu Ming now, they would have to face Emperor Cang when he returned.</p><p>hehe, little fellow, there’s no need to use Emperor Cang to threaten us!</p><p>The sage realm expert of the tianshen sect sneered.</p><p>They naturally did not believe Lu Ming’s words.</p><p>However, there was one thing that they could be sure of. Emperor Cang was still alive.</p><p>Previously, they had seen Emperor Cang’s chamber breaking through the void. With their cultivation of the Saint realm, they could indeed sense a faint trace of the great Emperor’s aura. Now, after hearing Lu Ming’s explanation, they were convinced that Emperor Cang was in the chamber.</p><p>Since Emperor Cang was not dead, it was impossible for Lu Ming to obtain Emperor Cang’s legacy. How could a living great emperor pass down his legacy? if they wanted someone else to inherit his legacy, they could just take him in as a disciple.</p><p>Since Lu Ming did not receive the legacy of Emperor Cang, there was no point in taking him down. On the contrary, it was not worth it to offend Dragon God Valley.</p><p>The few sages looked at each other and shook their heads.</p><p>let’s go. Since Emperor Cang is not dead, we should make plans!</p><p>“Go back and report to the sect master!”</p><p>Some of the Saints spoke one after another before leaving with the young men from their sects.</p><p>Hmph! the sage of the tianshen sect snorted coldly. His eyes flickered a few times, but he did not continue to pursue Lu Ming. He turned around and left.</p><p>senior brother he Yu, I heard that Lu Ming killed Wu Sandu of the Yu Du sect in the emperor’s chamber. It seems that another peerless genius is going to appear in Dragon God Valley!</p><p>At this moment, a voice was heard from the Dragon God Valley. The voice was very loud and spread far.</p><p>Yinfeng!</p><p>Lu Ming’s eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Yin Feng was deliberately trying to harm him!</p><p>Wu Sandu was the green-robed young man who was killed by Lu Ming in Emperor Cang’s bedroom.</p><p>As expected, the Saint stage powerhouse from the desire poison sect stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at Lu Ming. His body was filled with cold killing intent.</p><p>“Kid, so it turns out that Wu Sandu died by your hands!”</p><p>The Saint from the Yu Du sect said coldly. A layer of poisonous mist emanated from his body, and his powerful aura pressed down on Lu Ming.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>He Yu and Yin Feng sneered in the crowd of Dragon God Valley.</p><p>Lu Ming had managed to escape from the disaster under such circumstances just now. They could not accept that. Hence, they deliberately announced loudly that Lu Ming had killed Wu Sandu.</p><p>“So what if I killed him? In the great Emperor’s Secret realm, we were competing with each other. He wanted to kill me first, so how could I not kill him?”</p><p>Lu Ming said loudly.</p><p>“Then I’ll kill you and take revenge for him!”</p><p>The desire poison sect’s elder shouted loudly and stepped out. Poisonous gas filled the air.</p><p>Wu Sandu was the leader of the desire poison sect who had entered the great Emperor’s Secret realm this time. He was very talented and would definitely be a top-notch genius in the desire poison sect when he grew up in the future. However, he had been killed by Lu Ming.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
